According to social media posts and a subsequent statement from Vancouver-based QuadrigaCX, the issue arose through its use of a ""splitter contract"" which was utilized to separate incoming ethers and classic ethers (another cryptocurrency that arose from a blockchain split last year).  Yet a recent ethereum client software update, according to QuadrigaCX, led to a contract execution problem on their end.  The exchange said:  ""Due to an issue when we upgraded from Geth 1.5.3 to 1.5.9, this contract failed to execute the hot wallet transfer for a few days in May. As a result, a significant sum of ether has effectively been trapped in the splitter contract. The issue that caused this situation has since been resolved.""  Data from EtherScan shows that the contract in question currently holds 67,317.25 ETH – an amount worth roughly $14.7m at current ether prices.  The QuadrigaCX team stressed in its statement that the incident did not impact its solvency or ability to function, but rather ""has unfortunately eaten into our profits substantially"".  ""All withdrawals, including ether, are being processed as per usual and client balances are unaffected,"" the exchange said.  Representatives for QuadrigaCX did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Update: This article and its headline have been updated for clarity.

OpenBazaar is an open-source marketplace protocol that acts like a kind of decentralized eBay, connecting buyers and sellers who use bitcoin rather than, say, credit cards. The marketplace first went live last April.  The startup said it has raised $4.2m to date following the DCG investment. In December, OB1 announced that it had raised $3m in a funding round led by Berlin-based VC BlueYard. Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures also backed that round after they took part in an earlier $1m round alongside angel investor William Mougayar.  With the raise, the startup is continuing to push ahead with plans to launch a new version of OpenBazaar later this year.  ""OpenBazaar has seen steady growth since its launch just over a year ago,"" Brian Hoffman, OB1's chief executive, said in a statement, adding:  ""The network represents important strides forward in peer-to-peer and blockchain technology and we are honored to have the kind of investment partners who also share our vision for bringing it to life.""

42399948,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzCLK,1496417429,EU Commits €5 Million to Fund Blockchain Surveillance Research,"A group of government agencies, law enforcement groups and academic researchers are partnering on a new digital currency surveillance project.  Backed by €5m in funding from the European Union, the initiative, dubbed ""Tools for the Investigation of Transactions in Underground Markets"", or TITANIUM, will be conducted over the next three years.  Participants include Interpol, Interior Ministries from Spain and Austria, Finland's National Bureau of Investigation, and University College London, among others.  In statements, the project's backers cited a recent wave of ransomware attacks around the globe, pointing to the event as a justification for beefing up the ability to track cryptocurrency payments.  At the same time, those involved pledged not to violate user privacy rights.  ""The consortium will analyse legal and ethical requirements and define guidelines for storing and processing data, information, and knowledge involved in criminal investigations without compromising citizen privacy,"" said Ross King, senior scientist for the AIT Austrian Institute of Technology GmbH, one of the research institutions taking part.  That the EU would take this approach – let alone fund one – is perhaps unsurprising, given past efforts and statements from leaders and officials of the economic bloc.  The EU's executive branch, the European Council, began pushing aggressively for greater oversight of digital currency users in early 2016, with the European Parliament following suit earlier this year.

42399952,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzCPG,1496411403,Bank of Russia: 'It's Time to Develop National Cryptocurrencies',"Russia's central bank believes the time is right to develop and launch its own digital currency, one of its senior officials said today.  Olga Skorobogatova, deputy chief of the Bank of Russia, was speaking during an appearance at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum.  According to state-owned news service TASS, Skorobogatova touched on two key topics: its work with digital currencies, as well as the kinds of partners the Bank of Russia wants to work with on blockchain initiatives.  What was said: During the event, Skorobogatova issued comments about the Bank of Russia's work with digital currencies. It's an application that the bank has been publicly exploring since June 2016 at the earliest – at the time, the central bank's fintech head, Vadim Kalukhov, said that ""the matter is being studied"".  But Skorobogatova's comments are perhaps the most aggressive to date from the institution.  ""Regulators of all countries agree that it's time to develop national cryptocurrencies, this is the future. Every country will decide on specific time frames. After our pilot projects we will understand what system we could use in our case for our national currency,"" Skorobogatova was quoted as saying.  Among those the Bank of Russia wants to work with: members of the European Union.  ""We want to jointly test blockchain for cooperating with EU countries on the projects we're going to start this year,"" she said.  Skorobogatova notably remarked, per the publication's report, that blockchain adoption would be widely used over the next decade. Specifically, she offered a seven-to-ten year timeline during which firms in Russia's finance space – which have been testing applications for much of the past year – would move to integrate the tech more closely.  ""I think it will take us 7-10 years - not only the financial sector, but other sectors as well - to launch the production of this technology for serious projects,"" said Skorobogatova, according to TASS.  Why it matters: The comments shine a light on how the Bank of Russia is examining the question of digital currencies. It's an area of study being explored by a range of central banks, including those from China, Singapore and the UK, among others.  Skorobogatova's comments also come as the Bank of Russia develops new regulations for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The Russian central bank is reportedly planning to regulate bitcoin as a kind of digital good.

42399953,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzCOH,1496405783,A Dispassionate Defense of ICOs as an OK Thing,"Everyone seems to have an opinion on 'tokens' of late.  As if there weren't enough things to worry about in the world, the idea that a limited set of cryptographically unique data can be created and sold by anyone with an internet connection has emerged as a divisive issue, with everyone from the Financial Times to Reddit trolls weighing in.  How bad (you mean good?!) is it?  Well, let's just say people who generally decry the intervention of government are practically screaming for the regulators to be involved, and 'sensible' people are falling over chairs to distance 'blockchain' from the whole thing (and those are the more sane parts of the conversation).  What do I have to add? Just that it seems to mark a change that perhaps should be considered more dispassionately. Sorry, but tokens just aren't the end of the world (or the beginning of some new utopia).  Both sides have logical conclusions. Both are over-reaching to prove a point: Tokens are bad – woe the poor granny investor! Tokens are good – end to the Silicon Valley elites! (Written in true Silicon Valley style, of course.)  The better questions are: Should centuries of sensible regulation be discarded because of technology? (No.) Should tokens be demolished in infancy because of their threat to a highly risk-tolerant sub-population bent on 1,000% returns? (Also, probably no.)  In the words of Shooter McGavin, sometimes you have to play the ball as it lies. Sometimes that's off Frankenstein's fat foot...  But all of this sounds dumb  It does! Who needs a token? Not really anyone knows. (As with bitcoin, we should probably be OK with that.)  Maybe the guys at Polychain Capital know. They talk like reasonable people who know something that's too weird to discuss in much detail. (When your local Teslas need a protocol for a robotic union, then you'll know!)  Where to start? Bitcoin is a protocol. And in the words of Tom Ding (who ran a token sale platform that was VC funded, operational and closed before the term 'ICO' ever existed), it's a limited data set for a specific software instance.  As we've seen with bitcoin, this lets us send (increasingly expensive) bitcoins between parties around the world (sometimes to criminals!). What is that good for? Who knows? Payments? Maybe more things, maybe not.  What other software protocols need to behave like that? Leaderless and broadly usable? Got me there. But ethereum has made it super easy for us to find out. (Is this a use case? OK, let's forget it.)  Are any of these things good? Maybe. Tokens are likely this year's 'accepting bitcoin' – a way to appear trendy by using technology in a way that seems smart, but probably isn't a good intended use case.  If that's true, then this is ethereum's 2013 – expect more oddball brands to turn to the concept with little luck.  Infinite time  The common thread of both sides is there's a tendency to wrap these arguments in some kind of moral cloth.  As I'm writing this, I'm walking in the woods, typing on a little phone screen. Some time ago, I'd have used a pen and paper. Many centuries before that, a stone tablet and a big mallet.  I'd have to go somewhere to send this to you. Or maybe I wouldn't be able to send it at all. But I never really wanted to send you a letter (or a stone tablet). It's because of convenience – I'm lazy and largely apathetic – that I use a phone (or write this) at all.  Remember, I don't want to buy a record, I want to hear a song. I don't want to buy a stock, just exposure to some idea that makes my money go up or down (but preferably up). (Disclosure: I have never bought a stock and probably won't. It sounds terrible.)  Point being that technology very rarely ever seems to have a moral bent.  Like rock 'n' roll, it does, though, have an ingrained cultural posturing that sometimes, occasionally, but not really that often, has a real impact that propagates the myth.  Reinventing the wheel  (Wasn't part of this supposed to be positive? I'm getting there!)  As someone who stares at Coinmarketcap for hours, sure, it can be confusing. We have new things that look like other things, but kind of, sort of aren't. When token markets pump before an announcement... Insider trading?! Maybe, sort of. Moral outrage seems like an easy knee-jerk.  Tokens are often called a new kind of digital asset, but they're probably more like a digital invention.  If I invent the wheel and tell people about it, am I 'pumping'? If I did invent the wheel, you'd probably want to invent a wheel store. (That just seems like good advice.)  But 'Hey, only 130 people were in on the Brave sale!' Sure, but eight people invested 2 ETH (about $400) or less... See? Disrupting venture capital! Well, people need a lot of free income to invest in things, I hear.  Maybe we should focus on convenience and delivery. That seems like all we end up with anyway.  As Wences Casares reminded us at a Coin Center dinner last week: ""We have no chance, we're all up against infinite time"".  Tokens, in this context it seems, are likely to outlast us all.

42399940,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzCER,1496405011,Interoperability Boost: Ripple Sends Blockchain Transaction Across 7 Ledgers,"It just got a whole lot easier for banks to do business with bitcoin.  Yesterday, Ripple open-sourced the first bitcoin plug-in for its Interledger protocol (ILP), designed to seamlessly let users conduct transactions across a wide range of ledgers.  By open-sourcing the bitcoin tool, along with another plug-in for enterprise-focused platform Chain, Ripple was able to conduct, in a live demo, a single transaction across seven different ledgers. Conducted at the Blockchain Expo in Berlin, Germany, the single transaction went across public blockchains, private blockchains, a centralized ledger and a traditional payment channel.  While no single transaction would likely ever require so many ledger integrations, Ripple CTO Stefan Thomas said the purpose of the demo was to show future users that traditional channels can work in harmony with distributed ledgers.  Thomas said:  ""We think that’s where the future is going. We think that in the future all different ledgers will be tied together and transactions will be very seamless. So we want to make sure that our customers are going to be set up for success in that world.""  In addition to the newly open-sourced bitcoin and Chain integrations, an Interledger transaction for a ""relatively small"" value was also conducted with Ripple’s native currency, XRP, using both an XRP escrow and an XRP payment channel. Ethereum, Ripple’s centralized Five Bells Ledger and a so-called 'trustline' were also used in the transaction.  The payment was converted from fiat to ether to XRP to euros, depending on the payment channels, with Interledger’s connectors converting the currency and forwarding the payments from one ledger to another.  Interoperability in sight  The Interledger demonstration is part of an overall industry trend towards merging blockchains –one that has gained significant momentum this year.  In the last month alone, Blockstack launched its decentralized browser designed to let any number of blockchains mesh into a distributed version of the internet, and 0x launched an alpha version of its token trading platform built to allow decentralized applications to seamlessly interact by instantly exchanging their native tokens.  Co-inventor of the ILP and managing director of Ripple’s Luxembourg office, Evan Schwartz, positions the demonstration as part of a bigger-picture push to show blockchain interoperability has moved past being just a good idea.  ""What this shows is that with this kind of architecture that Interledger has, it’s not just about integrating two ledgers, it’s about doing this across many types of ledgers,"" Schwartz said.  Warming to cryptocurrency  Ripple initially released the ILP in October 2015, at a time when banks were even more wary about doing business with cryptocurrencies and had only just begun to explore non-cryptocurrency applications of blockchain technology.  Since the launch, banks have shown increasing interest in working with a wide range of distributed, shared databases and specifically blockchains, even if their willingness to transact in cryptocurrency remains largely stifled by concerns surrounding know-your-customer (KYC) compliance.  Ripple has, in part, helped overcome this reluctance by working with banks to build a wide range of early-stage products relying on its distributed ledger technology, but not its native currency.  Going forward though, that could change if the hesitance surrounding cryptocurrency lessens. This seems likely, because some banks around the world have already begun accommodating bitcoin companies that want to open fiat accounts. Ripple itself has even started building bank applications that rely on XRP, so the company seems to be preparing for a future of much broader acceptance.  ""Bitcoin is one of the most widely used and one of the most well-known ledgers,"" said Thomas. ""So any interoperability protocol has to be measured by [whether] it supports bitcoin, if it supports XRP, if it supports ethereum.""  Plug-in workshop  By the end of today, Ripple expects an eighth connector to be built at the Berlin event, one that would enable integration with litecoin. The process, according to Ripple executives, would take only a slight tweak of the bitcoin tool's code.  The firm further said a building session will take place, one in which it expects technologists from zcash, Lightning Network, GateHub, BigchainDB, PayPal and Monax’s Hyperledger Burrow to create yet more plug-ins.  Zcash and Monax have confirmed to CoinDesk that each will have a blockchain engineer in attendance to assist with the work.  Thomas concluded:  ""We want to make our customers happy, we want to act in the interest of our customers, and so part of that on our side – we’re all in the research department – means thinking about what our customers are going to want before they even realize it.""

42427588,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKWT1h,1496399767,A Discussion on Responsible Protocol Token Funding,"Tom Ding is an early crypto crowdfunding platform entrepreneur and the founder of String Labs, an incubator for blockchain systems.  In this opinion piece, Ding aims to provide an overview of considerations he believes should be made by those seeking to launch protocol tokens that power a decentralized network or decentralized application.      At last week's Consensus 2017 conference and Token Summit, almost every other conversation I had started or ended with a variation of the question: 'Do you have a token for sale? What token should I buy?'  It makes sense. Token funding is faster, more liquid and more equitable to all participants when compared to VC funding. Plus, it's an amazing mass growth hack for adoption.  That's the promise, and it's generally true when things are well designed.  Yet, as a long-time crypto entrepreneur and token participant, the funding structure of some projects deeply concerns me. Some have little substantial technical research or development, lack proper team (except the usual 'advisor' tricks), or worse off, consider token distribution an 'exit' opportunity for the founders.  Compounding this is the fact that, with the price rise, FOMO (fear of missing out) among investors is still at all-time high.  This post is intended to start a discussion on this critical topic. We as industry practitioners have a major responsibility to self-regulate, and shape the right market dynamics for this emerging industry.  What are we funding, really?  Protocols are software, but not just any old software. They are a set of software code that provide a coordinated service by formalizing (economic) relationships among its human and/or machine participants. By design, it benefits the public, and a properly designed protocol excels in something highly valuable known as 'social scalability', as explained by Nick Szabo.  To be more precise, what we're really funding is typically a specific instance of a protocol. The $18m contributed to ethereum, is primarily tied to one instance of the ethereum network (ETH) – which had a specific genesis block structure and was backed by the non-profit Ethereum Foundation. (Although, it could be argued that Ethereum Classic and other forks benefited from it.)  Now, how does that compare to traditional technology startup?  A startup funded by private company has a fiduciary responsibility to maximize shareholder values, first and foremost.  A protocol instance's objective, on the other hand, is to maximize values to all of its public participants.  Public protocols are by definition open-source, permissionless (enabling participation) and autonomous (functioning independent of the developer).  Thus we could logically extend that:  Donations to fund public protocols are, in fact, contribution to Commons. We are funding public good with private money, at scale and with economic incentives.  This crucial difference – of contributing towards a commons and sustainable network, rather than to a private company – should define how we think these funding activities, rather than simplistically recycle any startup logic.  For example, valuing a protocol-based network's tokens is fundamentally different from valuation of a startup, even if it has a comparable function, users and growth trajectory.  This is true for many different reasons – among them are:  Better liquidity  High loyalty level of the participants incentivized by the tokens.  The 'velocity of money' effect (for dapp tokens)  The value of the protocol as an independent network  The fact that it does not suffer from typical organizational uncertainty.    (See Aleksandr Bulkin’s excellent article for more discussions.)  Aligning incentives with developers  The tokens behind these public protocols are created as an instrument to incentivize a large group of independent actors to collectively make the protocol-based network more valuable, specifically on two set of people:  Rewarding developers for their initial efforts and ongoing developments  Incentivizing participants in the protocol to contribute, such as providing computation, uploading data, serving as an additional security factor, etc.    In a 'trustless' protocol, the strongest implicit trust is being placed on the developers (and foundations/companies behind them) to not screw up the protocol, either intentionally or for lack of motivation/competency.  Hence, what we should be constantly optimizing for are ways to incentivize them and align their interest with rest of community.  Foundations versus private companies  Given that public protocols themselves resemble public goods, there's a strong argument that many projects, exceptions notwithstanding, should adopt a not-for-profit model, where all money collected and a portion of the tokens goes to the foundation as an endowment.  A specific nuance, though, is how to deal with early contributors or companies who made significant financial investments to progress the project, prior to the token distribution. Reasonable, known practices include returning the investments as debt (with risk-adjusted interest), or rewarding the contributors with a portion of the tokens in proportion to the initial investments.  Note founders: This is not an 'exit event' for you.  We should in particular caution against attempts to turn the token funding into an 'exit' event. The distribution of the tokens is merely a beginning of a new dapp or blockchain network. The point of rewarding a founding team with tokens is to incentivize them to continue create value for the network and align their interest with broader stakeholders.  Yet, by agreeing to cashing out to the founders and team, this creates a dangerous incentive – the donators implicitly accepted a significant 'payment' – which they may not fully realize – for a new network that has not yet withstood the test of code quality, security or user adoption.  Should we fund private startups with tokens?  Sometimes there are valid reasons, or at least justifiable enough, to fund a private company, or consortium, instead of a not-for-profit.  For example, the protocol being developed is in a highly specialized vertical, regionally based, or the to-be-funded company has made a significant contribution to bootstrap the initial network. Another consideration is, on what layer does the protocol work? The closer you get to the blockchain layer, the less likely it should be a private company.  A (significant) 'private funding discount' should be applied to funding amount and network valuation to adjust for the:  Uncertainty of a private company (compared to a well-governed public foundation)  Its profit-driven influence over the network  The likelihood the code will be 'forked' into a new network.  Additional measures should be in place to balance and check the for-profit company, such as:  Regular reporting of the funding and deliverables  Deliverable-based vesting of funds    2. Vesting of early contributor tokens  The token economy is based on key developers and contributors, who are rewarded a good portion of the token distribution for their past and much-needed future contributions.  Thus, at least part of their tokens, in particular those paid as part of their pay check, should be vested over a certain period of time (such as 6–12 months or longer) to ensure that they have sufficient incentives to contribute positively to the project.  This could be implemented in a smart contract. The control of the vesting could be held by an independent foundation, a multisig of key community representatives or some type of community governance mechanism.  3. An argument for multiple rounds of fundraiser  You come up with a big idea of decentralized X. Write a beautifully crafted white paper. Put together a nice team. Token Launch! 24 hours later, you have $5m in cryptocurrency.  The question is, can the founders really execute that big idea? The dilemma most token donators face today is they're almost never given an opportunity for a careful evaluation. There's always a time rush amplified in a single round.  A more responsible way, for complex projects, is to divide them into smaller rounds with six months or longer in between, so people can take controlled risk and observe how the team execute in real world.  This could be achieved by a smart contract that predefines the rules for each round. (See DFINITY FDC for an example)  4. To cap or not to cap?  This is a contentious question.  Having no cap sounds inherently greedy: 'What would you use all this money for?' On the other hand, historically even good entrepreneurs significantly underestimate the funding they need to deliver a well-crafted product.  When you run out of funding, the project fails. No one is happy.  Further, in a bullish market, a cap can easily result in tokens ending up in the hands of a select few. Brave's Basic Attention Token just finished a $35m sale in 45 seconds, and 25% apparently went to a single address. So, there are really three separate underlying concerns here.  There needs to be:  Broader distribution for better decentralization  Enough money for the team to have a maximal chance of success  Equal participation rights.  Budgeting funding sources  Assuming the funding goes to a not-for-profit foundation, we need to factor in the budget for the lifespan of the foundation (eg 5–10 years). That's a bit different from your typical startup funding, which usually assumes a 12–18-month leeway as it expects more funding or revenue.  However, the initial crowdfunding is not the only source.  You could...  Have multiple rounds of funding – as discussed in Section 3  Tap into your endowment protocols tokens, which should grow in value if you’re doing a generally good job in adoption and technology. (In fact, the performance of a protocol foundation should be at least partly measured in token value growth, in the longer term.)  Use built-in 'token creation' mechanisms such that the protocol can issue more tokens to the foundation if the community agrees that the extra inflation is worth the incremental value the foundation creates.  Equality of participation and distribution  Combine a pseudonymous decentralized network with a bullish market and you end up with whales eating any cap you put on it. That's also bad if you’re aiming for broader distribution of tokens.  Here are some possible ideas that attempt to balance this goal with 'too much money' problem:  Set a soft cap with a steep premium for a post cap  Combine a funding event with a prediction market that can evaluate the success rate of the project in terms of tech, adoption, etc.  The harder question, of course, is why would a founding team ever want less money? What’s the check and balance?  In the future, I see two interesting possible paths for protocol-type foundations:  In its bylaws, the protocol foundation is at least partly governed by a on-chain community governance mechanism, that has certain budgeting or veto power. Think of a 'robot' that has voting power of one in a board of three.  A completely 'foundation-less' structure that gives the full budgeting and strategy control to a sophisticated on-chain governance structure. This becomes 10 times more powerful when a robust stable currency system such as PHI becomes available and combines with a sophisticated governance such as Blockchain Nervous System.

42427578,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKWSlh,1496375643,Bitcoin's 'Segwit2x' Scaling Proposal: Miners Offer Optimistic Outlook,"""The number means something. Hash power means something.""  As explained by Xiangfu Liu, co-founder of bitcoin mining chip maker Canaan, there are few things more sacred in bitcoin than the idea that the strength of a blockchain is the computing power dedicated to securing its ledger. But while bitcoin's miners remain united in this daily pursuit, their opinions on a new scaling proposal seem decidedly mixed.  Known as 'Segwit2x', the proposal, spearheaded by bitcoin investment conglomerate Digital Currency Group, aims to move forward with two changes to the bitcoin network: an optimization called Segregated Witness (SegWit) and an increase to the hardcoded parameter limiting the size of its transaction blocks.  Notable about the effort is its claim it draws support from more than 80% of bitcoin's computing power. Mining industry participants including Bitcoin.com, Bitfury, Bitmain, BTCC, F2Pool and ViaBTC all signed an agreement supporting the solution, alongside roughly 50 industry startups.  Such participation has done much to lend validation to the effort. That's because, due to how the network functions, miners (along with nodes) must upgrade to any new software – a position some have argued makes them voters in a kind of electoral process.  Still, their motivations and exceptions appear varied.  Notable was a palpable fatigue in answering questions about protocol changes at all, a sign of the years-long debate that's split the industry. Wang Chun, owner of F2Pool, a signatory on the proposal which accounts for more than 7% of bitcoin's hashing power, suggested he wasn't supporting it from a position of enthusiasm.  Chun told CoinDesk:  ""I keep away from the debating parties and do my own things. Let them keep debating.""  Others broke along typical partisan lines.  Haipo Yang, founder and CEO of mining pool ViaBTC, which represents roughly 4% of the bitcoin network's hash power, for example, was in favor of the proposal. Long a proponent of boosting the block size to 2MB via a hard fork, Yang went so far as to state the mechanism could force those who disagree off the blockchain.  ""[A split] is a good thing in my opinion,"" he said, citing philosophical disagreements with bitcoin developers (who have largely been critical of the proposal).  Jack Liao, CEO of LightningAsic, a maker of bitcoin ATMs, miners and wallet hardware, agreed, but from the opposite angle. He cited past issues with alternative implementations of the bitcoin software as evidence that Bitcoin Core, the network's largely volunteer group of developers, is the ""only good team"" that could help steer and navigate such changes.  Startup role  Mixed feelings were also prevalent as bitcoin's startup community asserted itself in the technical conversation.  Most past agreements, or attempts at agreements, have largely featured involvement from Bitcoin Core developers and China-based miners, as each group represents the largest bloc of constituents from the two parties most responsible for the network's daily functioning.  But, Gadi Glikberg, owner of Connect BTC, a mining pool owned by hardware provider Bitmain, noted he believes startups play a key role as larger corporates have yet to become invested in the ecosystem.  ""We don't have any real large enterprises yet. I think that in this example startups fill in that void and speak as an important actor in the ecosystem,"" he said.  Others were open to the idea, but think this assertion creates a mixed context for discussion, because, from an academic perspective, it may not be clear which businesses are best suited for the use of a blockchain, a technology created by bitcoin and with little past precedent.  ""Philosophically, I'm not convinced bitcoin actually has a problem,"" said long-time bitcoin miner and GigaWatt founder Dave Carlson. ""It just presents a problem for certain business models.""  Carlson added, that as GigaWatt hosts miners on behalf of individuals who then elect mining pools, his firm believes in letting miners choose which solution to support.  Others saw a similar conclusion putting pressure on the debate.  ""I think some companies can use the private blockchain for sure,"" Liu said. However, here he noted that the appeal of the hashing power securing the ledger makes the bitcoin blockchain quite valuable to startups.  Future outlook  Overall, though, remarks were positive about the deal, provided it could sidestep issues that have stymied by past disagreements.  Of particular reference was the so-called 'Hong Kong Agreement', a meeting of developers and miners that also saw participation from 80% of bitcoin's mining power providers. That agreement called for the completion of SegWit and a hard fork in mid-2017, though it broke down as key deadlines were missed.  ""In China, there is always talk about the Hong Kong Agreement. So, as long as people follow the agreement, I think this is doable,"" Liu remarked.  Elsewhere, supporters noted that much is riding on the specific technology that will underlie the proposal and change the network rules. Currently, development is being overseen by bitcoin security startup BitGo, with help from other developers including Bloq co-founder Jeff Garzik. Startups including Bitcoin.com, Bitfury and Xapo have pledged technical assistance, though they have yet to provide details on what this would entail.  Still, there was a sense that amid a booming market for cryptocurrencies, the ecosystem now has new resolve to make changes that boost both the perception of bitcoin and the scalability of its underlying technology.  ""I think that the companies that committed to the agreement remain committed,"" Glikberg said, concluding:  ""It is now time for the shared developer resources to come together and deliver the code that will get the ball rolling.""
