42421068,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXCvwz,1540926959,Data Shows Millions Leaving Crypto Wallets Tied to Long-Troubled Exchange,"The world's largest cryptocurrency exchange Binance has frozen accounts that received more than 93,000 ether from two wallets indirectly linked to the troubled Russian exchange WEX.  The accounts were frozen on October 25, Leah Li, a spokeswoman for Binance, told CoinDesk. The action was taken in response to pleas from WEX users who have been watching the ethereum blockchain, the known location of a public wallet belonging to the WEX exchange, uneasily in recent months while they have been unable to withdraw their funds off the exchange.  These users traced the flow of funds through the ethereum blockchain and concluded that the two wallets that sent the ether to Binance – in 25 transactions from August through October – were controlled by entities related to WEX. The traders have expressed concern that they won't get their money back now that the funds have been moved to Binance.  They are worried because WEX, a successor to the defunct BTC-e exchange that inherited its infrastructure, has not allowed withdrawals for major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether since July. Given a lack of answers or clarity about the state of affairs at WEX, frustrated users began filing police reports with Russian authorities earlier this month.  Hundreds of users appear to be affected by WEX's ongoing withdrawal issues, judging from the size of the Telegram chat groups devoted to discussing the situation; one has more than 1,000 members, another focused on filing police reports has more than 400.  And at least $18 million is now believed to be at risk, based on the market value of the ether that flowed into Binance. The total figure could be higher, since only ether has been spotted leaving WEX-linked wallets so far, and users have been unable to withdraw most other coins for months.  The situation underscores the risks crypto users have long faced when trusting exchanges with their money. WEX opened for business shortly after the U.S. government shut down BTC-e in July 2017, slapping it with a multi-million dollar fine. At launch, WEX founder Dmitrii Vasilev framed the new exchange as a re-launch of BTC-e and said he was working with the old platform's administrator and would restore its customers' balances.  For almost a year, WEX functioned normally and had the full trust of former BTC-e users, some of them told CoinDesk. But the situation has gone quickly south, perhaps best exemplified by the highly inflated prices for many of the exchange's trading pairs.  ""Help us to return our money!"" a trader named Maxim M. wrote in an Oct. 20 email to Binance and shared with CoinDesk. ""If you don't want to follow the path of BTC-e, which was closed down by the authorities following its use in the laundering of cryptocurrency stolen from Mt. Gox, you should suspend all the WEX's wallets and accounts.""  Vasilev did not respond to requests for comment for this story.  Binance's Li said the Malta-based exchange was ""not familiar with the specific situation at WEX,"" but ""we always investigate user claims thoroughly and we will suspend account access if any unusual activity is detected."" She added:  ""We are encouraging users who may be impacted to file reports with local law enforcement and ask them to send us case numbers or official notices/letters of investigation. So far, we haven't been provided with any notices yet.""  Li later clarified that the freeze is only temporary, saying, ""we're only able to freeze accounts for a short time; some sort of letter from law enforcement is required for a longer-term freeze.""  Following the money  A CoinDesk review of public ethereum data found that the trail from the two wallets that sent ETH to Binance ultimately leads back to an address that was controlled by BTC-e.  Further, the analysis shows that the BTC-e-tied address is linked, by way of a divergent path of transactions, to the one wallet clearly belonging to WEX.  The BTC-e address is identified as such on Etherscan, a popular ethereum block explorer. Often, exchanges ask Etherscan to attach their brand name to their wallets, and if they can prove they are the real owners, the name gets assigned. Binance's address is similarly labeled, but none of the more than 10 others are in the web of transactions between it and BTC-e.  The series of transactions began on July 29, 2017, when 485,705 ETH was transferred from the BTC-e address in one batch to another address that users believe to be WEX's first wallet.  Subsequently, that address sent 480,000 ETH in 32 large, round-number transactions from September 2017 through January 2018 to a single address.  CoinDesk has confirmed that this wallet, pictured in the image below, belonged to WEX, since six users provided screenshots of their WEX withdrawal transactions – all of which involved the address, 0xb3AAAae47070264f3595c5032eE94b620A583a39.  But this WEX wallet was not the only recipient of ether from BTC-e. Another 184,772 ETH was transferred to the address 0x95cDdecd01856aA896426bd1ee021D87F3A5c199, and from there, smaller portions later traveled through several different addresses.  Eventually, two addresses – each connected to the BTC-e wallet through a different chain of six addresses – sent significant amounts of ETH to the address identified on Etherscan as belonging to Binance.  The first of these wallets sent 78,581 ETH to Binance in about two dozen transactions between August and October. The other wallet sent 14,794 ETH to the exchange in three transactions on October 15, October 18 and October 22.  Maxim, the trader, said Binance's initial response to his alert was discouraging.  ""They responded that they can't do anything so far but would watch those wallets carefully,"" he said.  The text of Binance's response, which Maxim sent to CoinDesk, reads: ""Really thanks for your information, we are willing to cooperate with you. But at present it is hard for us to check all the account from WEX and take action. Anyway, we will keep an eye on this issue, if any update please feel free to contact us.""  While Binance spokesperson Li said the accounts were frozen on the 25th, this information was apparently not shared with frustrated WEX users until after CEO Zhao Changpeng (CZ) was asked about the issue on Twitter.  On Monday night, a Twitter user going by the name John James tweeted: ""WEX cold wallets are moving funds through @binance. Meaning Binance is potentially help launder millions of dollars worth of stolens funds from Wex users. We have proof too. @cz_binance.""  CZ responded quickly: ""The identified accounts are frozen, please report to law enforcement and have a case number. We will work with LE. This is part of centralization we hate too, dealing with other exchange's mess (we don't even know the details). But we will do what we can.""

42429887,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM22dh,1540924333,Bank of America Patent Hints at Plan to Store Cryptocurrency Keys,"Bank of America was awarded a patent for a device that stores cryptographic keys and the document's details hint at applications for cryptocurrencies.  In a patent awarded Tuesday by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the bank outlines a ""hardened storage device"" for storing private keys – such as those used for blockchain platforms – explaining that, at present, most keys are stored locally protected by nothing more than a password.  ""In specific embodiments of the system, the authentication routine is conducted as part of a crypto-currency transaction, a blockchain transaction or the like,"" the patent states.  The patent references ""crypto-currencies"" several times, though overall, the document leaves it open keys of other sorts to be applied to the proposed device.  According to Bank of America, given that computers storing these keys are usually connected to the internet or other public networks, local storage means that they ""are continuously susceptible to being misappropriated.""  ""Therefore, a need exists for a secure means for storing private cryptography keys,"" the patent goes on to state, specifying that this storage method should ""reduce the risk"" of a user's private keys being stolen.  That Bank of America would suggest that its technology patents could be applied to the realm of cryptocurrencies and blockchain isn't surprising, given that the firm is a prolific filer of patents in this area.  As Fortune reported in June, Bank of America has sought patent rights to dozens of possible applications in an effort to ""be prepared"" for future uses.

Speaking at the Canada Fintech Forum on Monday, Yellen, who served as chairman of the Board of Governors of the Fed between 2014 and 2018, outlined a number of concerns she has with bitcoin in general and the idea of central bank-issued cryptocurrencies specifically.  Yellen spoke about price volatility, investor risks and the threat of hackings in a five-minute speech, according to a video posted online by Francis Pouliot.  ""I will just say outright I am not a fan, and let me tell you why,"" Yellen said. ""I know there are hundreds of cryptocurrencies and maybe something is coming down the line that is more appealing but I think first of all, very few transactions are actually handled by bitcoin, and many of those do take place on bitcoin are illegal, illicit transactions.""  Yellen has previously described bitcoin as a ""highly speculative asset"" in testimony before Congress. Months prior, a separate (and unrelated) appearance by Yellen before a Congressional committee featured a now-infamous ""Buy Bitcoin"" sign appearing behind the former Fed chair.  Referencing bitcoin's use as a payment method, she said on Monday:  ""It is one ... thought that for something to be a useful currency, it needs to be a stable source of value, and bitcoin is anything but. So it's not used for a lot of transactions, it's not a stable source of value and it's also not an efficient means for processing payments. It's very slow in handling payments.""  This is due in part to bitcoin's decentralized nature, she said.  Moreover, Yellen argued bitcoin's energy use is ""very high"" when compared to traditional payments rails, which she believes is another sign that bitcoin is not an effective form of currency or a stable source of value.  Regarding central bank digital currencies, Yellen took aim at other perceived issues. For one thing, central bank-issued cryptocurrencies ""could have negative impacts on financial stability,"" she said.  She added that ""in introducing essentially a digital version of cash, first of all, cash is anonymous and again the terrorist financing, money laundering, Bank Secrecy Act concerns would become enormous if you had something digital that is also anonymous.""  Other concerns revolve around cybersecurity, Yellen contended. Global anonymous currencies ""would be an obvious target for cyberattacks,"" according to the former Fed chief.

Speaking in Prague on Tuesday at Devcon4, ethereum's annual developer conference, Fabian Vogelsteller proposed a ""reversible ICO,"" or RICO, that would allow token investors to take back their funds at any stage in that project's lifespan. Specifically, the concept involves the creation of a special-purpose smart contract that allows investors to ""reverse their funding commitment.""  ""You are able to withdraw the funds you committed at any point of time and you do this by simply sending back your tokens,"" Vogelsteller told the audience.  Once ether has been refunded, other investors can buy in, Vogelsteller continued. Because this is likely to lead to fluctuation in the value underlying a project, Vogelsteller said the startups will need some ""base funding"" from private investors outside of the ICO as well.  According to Vogelsteller, the methods ""makes scams unlikely."" Because investors can withdraw funds at any time, ICO startups are more directly incentivized to commit to their promises. Additionally, it ""allows projects to fail naturally"" without the risk of token investors losing funds as the project collapses.  ICOs have increased in popularity in the past two years, attracting over $20 billion in accumulative funding, according to the CoinDesk ICO Tracker.  Vogelsteller said Tuesday that many of the companies pursuing token sales deviate from ethereum's vision of decentralization. Flooded with large amounts of capital at the early stage of a project, companies are encouraged to ""[buy] lambos rather than doing something useful.""  Because of his role in the ICO boom as the author of the ERC-20 standard, Vogelsteller said he felt ""obligated to come up with something better.""  Intended to be a more usable orientation of founder of ethereum Vitalik Buterin's own attempt toward a safer ICO scheme, the first step for RICO is to test the code in the wild. Toward this end, the developer will deploy the method within his own startup, a fashion-and-design industry blockchain named Lukso.  As Vogelsteller told the audience:  ""It brings the balance back between the community and the project and I think this is really important.""

At press time, bitcoin's sell-off yesterday appears to have exposed the wider market to its worst losses since Oct. 11, a development that has caused the top 20 crypto assets by market capitalization to depreciate 3-10 percent and break down after a 12-day consolidation period.  With the move, dash (DASH), litecoin (LTC), bitcoin cash (BCH), ether (ETH) and neo (NEO) have effectively erased any gains earned in 2018, according to exchange and CoinMarketCap data.  Weekly chart  Of the assets listed above, DASH is trading at $154 – a $130 difference to last years levels of $284 last seen Oct. 30, 2017, while BCH is trading at $472 on Oct. 30 last year now standing at $419 – a $53 difference.  Ether (ETH) is also down on last year's Oct. 30 levels of $305, currently changing hands at $197 – a $108 difference.  It's also the same case for LTC and NEO down $6.66 and $12.55 respectively, which have both struggled to mount a reversal in the bearish trend that has been ongoing since bitcoin's breakdown in early Jan.  Granted around this time last year price action spurred on by the ICO madness, sparked a massive bull-run that shot the price of bitcoin up to its all-time high of $20,000 in late Dec.  This had the dual effect of increasing the value of the entire alt-coin market as people poured into crypto increasing the total market capitalization to its peak of $817 billion on Jan. 8, 2018.  A turn for the worse?  Things have changed since bitcoin first fell below a key indicator back in March of this year, which signified greater bearish conditions had taken hold as investors sought to exit altogether.  The 200-Daily Moving Average  (DMA) demonstrated a complete loss of bullish control the second time around when bitcoin attempted its move above $10,000 on March 12, 2018.  Bitcoin's dominance rate has also steadily increased by 0.44 percent on the week, presenting a shift away from altcoins in lieu of the expected November run-up.  So it seems the bears have tightened their grip on the altcoin market possibly feeding into the new year instead of experiencing a bullish resurgence like some are expecting until they can once again break above their year-on-year targets.

42429843,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM1wPh,1540904381,This New Ethereum Software Client Is Built With Enterprises in Mind,"Enterprise ethereum may have just received a shot in the arm.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, Pantheon is a suite of ethereum-based services built by PegaSys, a 50-strong engineering team at the ethereum design studio ConsenSys. Setting it apart from other enterprise versions of the second-largest blockchain, Pantheon has an Apache 2.0 open-source software license, rather than the more restrictive general public license (GPL), and it uses Java as its base-level programming language.  Those are important features from an enterprise perspective. Using the Java programming language invites a huge coder community and lots of useful tools. Moreover, changing to the Apache 2.0 license allows businesses to own and monetize the intellectual property they create when building on top of ethereum.  ""When I used to work on the consulting side of the house at ConsenSys, basically legal departments would just throw up a roadblock if you try to use a GPL in production,"" Faisal Khan, head of strategy and business development at PegaSys, told CoinDesk.  Explaining the impetus to create Pantheon Core, Khan said there wasn't really a client or protocol that was building for both the needs of the ethereum public chain community and also focusing on the standards being pushed by the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA).  Released today at Devcon, the annual gathering of ethereum devs, Pantheon will begin by plugging into standard ethereum application programming interfaces (APIs) and ethereum virtual machine (EVM) calls, Khan said. It will also slot in place with other clients like Geth (a tool for running an ethereum node in the Go language) and Parity (an ethereum client written in another programming language called Rust).  A full enterprise Pantheon release, scheduled for early next year, will have enhanced privacy features and permissioning controls, which are paramount to regulated business like banks and financial services firms.  These are ""things you can get currently only through Quorum for the most part,"" Khan said, referring to the privacy-centric blockchain platform built by JP Morgan. Pantheon is working collaboratively with the Wall Street bank in this area, he added.  Apache 2 licensing  Stepping back, there have been attempts in the past to bring ethereum under the Apache license, such as abortive efforts coordinated by the ethereum and Hyperledger communities back at beginning of 2017 to incorporate the C++ ethereum client under more permissive licensing.  A version of ethereum did later make it into Hyperledger and Apache in the form of the open source Burrow blockchain, contributed by distributed ledger technology (DLT) builder Monax. More recently, the ethereum and Hyperledger connection has been strengthened by advancements with the implementation known as Sawtooth and also recent announcements about the Hyperleder Foundation and EEA working together.  Khan agreed that Sawtooth and Burrow have benefitted from combining ethereum's extensive developer community with some of Hyperledger's permissioning features, while also meeting enterprise needs under Apache.  ""So we wanted to provide like a fully ethereum-based alternative,"" he said.  Khan pointed out that current licensing of ethereum has not stopped people from building tools and even going towards production, as demonstrated by many EEA members.  ""But using Apache license gives people the ability to create a module that integrates with, or sits on top of Pantheon and then you can license that and create a business model around that, which we think is a pretty powerful incentive, "" he said.  Ethereum client 'graveyard'  Khan said establishing an ethereum client that develops its enterprise-focused features in lock-step with the evolution of the public ethereum blockchain looks towards a grand interoperability prize in the future.  ""It's still very early to talk about how Pantheon in a private network might work with the public network, but there are multiple areas of research,"" said Khan, citing exploratory work being done with sidechains, a range of privacy features and other solutions such as Parity bridges.  But building a new ethereum client (and maintaining it) is not easy.  As Peter Szilagyi of the Ethereum Foundation rather poetically pointed out, there's a ""graveyard"" of ethereum clients (Haskell, Ruby, C++) that are no longer maintained because of the amount of work involved and the blockchain network's constant evolution.  Khan pointed out that Geth and Parity have full teams working on client development and smaller communities find that sustaining this is a lot of work, adding,  ""In general I think there could be more incentives for contributing at the protocol layer. At the [distributed application] layer, you can go and do a token sale to fund your project.""

42429853,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM1wdh,1540900746,Parity to Help Zcash (the Currency) Gain Independence From Zcash (the Startup),"The privacy-centric Zcash cryptocurrency just took a small step toward greater decentralization.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, ethereum-focused startup Parity Technologies is partnering with the non-profit Zcash Foundation to create the first zcash node software that isn't built or managed by the Zerocoin Electric Coin Company led by Zooko Wilcox.  As part of that shift, the foundation is looking to hire four engineers to manage development and upkeep for open-source projects. Meanwhile, Parity CTO Fredrik Harrysson told CoinDesk his startup will have two engineers devoted to building this new zcash node.  ""Zcash holds, obviously, a special place in this ecosystem. It's one of few zero-knowledge proof-oriented approaches to privacy,"" Harrysson said, referring to a cryptographic method that allows systems to verify a calculation or transaction without revealing its details. ""Building that zero-knowledge proof expertise in our company is really important.""  This move also shows how the Zcash Foundation is looking to prioritize decentralization, given that until now, development of the privacy coin was dominated by Wilcox's startup. By the end of 2019, zcash users will be able to choose which software to implement. Both options will be almost identical, but it may not always be that way.  ""Philosophically, both the foundation and the zcash startup are fork-friendly,"" the Zcash Foundation's communications manager, Sonya Mann, told CoinDesk, meaning they don't object to anyone creating splinter versions of the cryptocurrency. ""If, down the road, issues arose that lead to a fork, I can see it happening amicably, which I think is highly unusual.""  Since Wilcox himself told CoinDesk in June that the zcash community needs multiple parties adding checks-and-balances to the overall system, the startup's notable absence from this project shows how the foundation is maturing on its own trajectory. Mann called the Parity partnership an ""important milestone"" for the zcash community at-large.  Speaking to that point, Harrysson added that having multiple implementations can lead to more diverse contributions and secure systems.  ""It fosters more developers. Maybe C++ isn't something that everyone wants to get involved with,"" he said, naming a programming language by way of example. ""In ethereum, that [multiple implementations] has often led to performance improvements, in shielded transactions especially"" – i.e. those that take advantage of zero-knowledge proofs' privacy enhancements.  Building bridges  Beyond bolstering options for zcash users, this collaboration will help Parity develop expertise for its upcoming interoperability solution, Polkadot, which aims to allow transactions across and between different blockchains.  ""We want to launch Polkadot with a zcash bridge from day one,"" Harrysson said. ""We believe that zcash has some big feature sets to add to this interoperability. ""  Most notably, this zcash node will make use of Parity's libraries for Rust, a programming language often used for projects related to bitcoin. Harrysson said investing in this infrastructure will make it easier to eventually build bridges between blockchains, such as bitcoin and zcash or ethereum.  ""Polkadot is a sharding method at the end of the day, so we may be able to see some sharding benefits for zcash with this,"" he added, referencing how polkadot will also include scaling solutions. ""Having different implementations, we've found in ethereum that it means you have people coming at solutions with different approaches.""  From Harrysson's perspective, collaborations between companies in different crypto communities can pave the way for more organic, decentralized contributions down the road.  ""Ultimately, decentralization comes from no companies, no foundations, it should be completely spread out where developers across the world independently contribute to the ecosystem,"" he said. ""Hopefully, though, this collaboration could lead to that.""  Referring to the human resources both his company and the foundation are contributing, Harrysson added:  ""Without this starting capital, I think it's hard to make something like this happen just naturally.""

The leading cryptocurrency, which was sidelined above $6,400 for 10 days straight, fell to two-week lows near $6,200 yesterday, confirming a range breakdown.  Essentially, the bears have come out victorious in a tug of war with the bulls. As a result, risks are skewed to the downside. More importantly, a prolonged period of extremely low volatility ended with a sell-off yesterday, hence, there could be more losses to come.  Still, the bears are cautioned against being too aggressive, as a bounce from the 21-month exponential moving average (EMA) support of $6,109 cannot be ruled out. Further, the trendline connecting June lows and August lows is lined up at $6,094.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $6,250 on Coinbase, representing a 1.8 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.  Daily chart  As seen in the above chart, the 5-day and 10-day EMAs have rolled over in favor of the bears following yesterday's range breakdown.  The indicators are also biased toward the bears. For instance, the MACD has produced a bearish crossover, while both the relative strength index (RSI) and the stochastic are reporting bearish conditions below 50.00.  Monthly chart  Over on the monthly chart, the sell-off from the record high of $20,000 seems to have ended around the 21-month EMA in the last four months.  So far, however, the bulls have failed to produce a meaningful bounce, despite the repeated bear failure to beat the EMA support.  The bear market would resume if the cryptocurrency closes below the 21-month EMA tomorrow (monthly close).  View  The range breakdown could yield a drop to major supports lined up at $6,100.  A UTC close today below the trendline support of $6,094 would bolster the already bearish setup and boost the prospects of a monthly close (tomorrow) below the 21-month EMA.  A UTC close above the 10-day EMA of $6,355 would weaken the bearish pressure.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

42429848,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM1wTh,1540890003,Bitcoin Trader Pleads Guilty Over Unlicensed Exchange Business,"A 21-year-old bitcoin trader from California has pleaded guilty to operating an unlicensed money transmission business and now faces a maximum of five years in prison.  According to a news release issued Monday by the Attorney's Office of the Southern District of California, the trader, Jacob Burrell Campos, admitted as part of a plea deal that he had operated a bitcoin exchange without registering the business with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).  Furthermore, Burrell had no anti-money laundering or know-your-customer procedures in place.  ""Unlicensed money transmitting businesses, especially those operating at or near the border, pose a serious threat to the integrity of the U.S. banking system, and provide an 'open door' for criminals to utilize such businesses to launder the proceeds of their illicit activities,"" said U.S. Attorney Adam Braverman in the report.  Burrell reportedly sold hundreds of thousands of dollars in bitcoin to over 1,000 customers throughout the U.S. from January 2015 to April of 2016. He initially bought bitcoin through a regulated crypto exchange in the U.S., but later shifted to a Hong Kong-based exchange after his U.S. account was closed over suspicious transactions.  From March 2015 to April 2017, he bought bitcoins worth $3.29 million from the Hong Kong exchange in separate transactions, the report says.  Burrell has now agreed to forfeit a total of $823,357 to the U.S. and will be sentenced in February of next year.  Braverman said:  ""The Department of Justice will continue to investigate and prosecute all individuals and businesses that seek to evade the licensing and anti-money laundering requirements under federal law.""

42429851,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM1wZh,1540886400,"What Bitcoin's White Paper Got Right, Wrong and What We Still Don't Know","Joseph Bonneau is an assistant professor at New York University and co-author of ""Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies,"" a popular textbook.  This exclusive opinion piece is part of CoinDesk's ""Bitcoin at 10: The Satoshi White Paper"" series.      The Bitcoin white paper has been, rightfully, recognized as one of the most original and influential computer science papers in history.  It has launched a billion-dollar industry and thousands of follow-up papers.  But it's worth turning a critical eye on the paper (and elements of the original Bitcoin design omitted from the paper) to ask what did the paper get right? What did it get wrong? And what questions do we still not know the answer to?  What Bitcoin got right  This may be the hardest category to compile.  One mark of a truly successful idea is that we forget how people thought about the world before that idea came around. Many of the most fundamental contributions of Bitcoin seem obvious only in hindsight.  It's easy to forget that cryptocurrency was a research backwater for most of the 2000s. After the failure of many attempts in the 1990s to build a working system (largely using the ideas outlined by David Chaum in the 1980s), few papers were published in the area. Many simply believed there was no viable market for a non-state currency.  Prior to Bitcoin, decentralized systems were an active research area in the 2000s (often described as peer-to-peer networks) and anonymity research was coming into its own (with the development of Tor and other systems).  But these were not seen as necessary features for a payment system. What did Bitcoin contribute?  Incentives for miners. One of Bitcoin's core contributions is providing incentives for miners via inflation and fees. This model has generally been successful and it's fair to say few saw it coming. Many P2P systems in the pre-Bitcoin era that offered open participation (anybody can run a node) were plagued by Sybil attacks and other problems. There were many attempts to incentivize honest participation, but prior to Bitcoin no system quite got it to work.  Light clients. Bitcoin's support for both full nodes and light (or SPV) nodes has proven quite powerful, and the block structure embedded into Bitcoin has made it not just possible but natural to implement a light client.  Scripting. While limited, Bitcoin's scripting support (not discussed at all in the white paper) has enabled several useful features like multi-signature accounts and payment networks. It was wise to envision a system supporting more than simple payments.  Recognizing long-term incentives. Satoshi didn't anticipate industrial-scale mining or mining pools, at least not in the white paper. But the paper does include a very prescient line about the risks of centralization: ""[an attacker] ought to find it more profitable to play by the rules, such rules that favour him with more new coins than everyone else combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth."" Despite a large number of theoretical attacks by miners being written about since, none have been seriously attempted in practice. Satoshi recognized a powerful principle – that miners have long-term incentives not to attack since they are invested in health of the ecosystem.  What Bitcoin got wrong  We'll ignore some quaint-in-retrospect features in early versions of the bitcoin code, such as pay-to-IP-address and a built-in e-commerce system, that never saw the light of day.  But there are several features of Bitcoin that appear ""wrong"" in that no system built today should repeat them.    ECDSA. While this signature algorithm was a far better choice than, say, RSA, it is inferior to EC-Schnorr in all aspects. Most likely Satoshi simply didn't know about this option (a legacy of software patents around Schnorr). Today, it would be clearly advantageous to use Schnorr instead given its support for threshold signing, if not a more advanced signature scheme such as BLS.  Transaction malleability. This unintentional issue has led to headaches for protocols such as payment networks as well as famously enabling the attack on Mt. Gox. Today a prudent design would use something along the lines of segregated witness (SegWit) to ensure transaction hashes are non-malleable.  Features since added. Quite obviously, it was a mistake not to include popular features such as pay-to-script-hash (P2SH) and check-locktime-verify, which have been added since by soft forks.  Limited divisibility of coins. Bitcoin has a limit of 21 million bitcoins, but more importantly, it has a limit of about 2^52 satoshis as the atomic unit. If Bitcoin were to really become Earth's only payment system, this would provide fewer than a million units per human being. This isn't nearly enough to capture both day-to-day transactions (even rounded to the equivalent of tenths of a dollar) and also large holdings. It would have been quite cheap to expand this with a few dozen extra bits such that divisibility would never be an issue.  Blocks in a simple chain. Given how much of a buzzword ""blockchain"" has become it's worth noting that putting blocks in a linear chain is an oversight that makes it costly for an ultra-lightweight client to verify that an old block is included in the current chain. Bitcoin correctly puts transactions into a tree, so why not the blocks themselves? A skip list would be another major improvement. Interestingly, the Certificate Transparency project (designed independently of Bitcoin in the same era) gets it right and puts each update into a tree, while few successors to Bitcoin have strayed from the linear chain design.  No state commitments. Bitcoin miners all track the system state as the set of unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs). But this is not committed to each block and must be imputed from history. This makes it hard for light clients to confirm what the current state is and if the transaction has been spent. It would be quite easy to add a UTXO commitment to each block and many subsequent systems (such as Ethereum) do a version of this.  Simplistic attack analysis. The Bitcoin white paper devotes a relatively large amount of space (about a quarter of the text) to analyzing the chances of a miner with less than 51% mining power successfully launching a fork by getting lucky. Subsequent analysis has identified many other attack vectors (such as selfish mining) and this analysis now looks dated.  One-CPU-one-vote. Satoshi described Bitcoin as a system where most participants would be miners using their CPUs. This has not been the case for many years now as mining is dominated by dedicated hardware. While it's debatable if ASIC mining is a good or bad development-it's certainly not what was pitched in the original white paper.  What we still don't know  SHA-256 puzzles. Bitcoin's use of hash-based computational puzzles (""proof-of-work"") has been one of the most active topics of debate. Does it consume too much energy? Do ASICs encourage centralization? Would puzzles designed for GPU-based mining or storage-bounded mining produce better incentives at lower cost? Will proof-of-stake eventually win out?  The block size and other parameter limits. To say the least, the 1 MB block limit has been a source of debate, as has been (to a lesser extent) the 10-minute interval between blocks. Many follow-up systems have thrived with larger or more frequent blocks. Is Bitcoin's conservative design going to prove wise in the long run?  Anonymity. The arguments sketched in the white paper about Bitcoin providing anonymity as only public keys are posted are now known to be incomplete due to the development of transaction-graph analysis. Systems such as Confidential Transactions, Monero or Zcash offer stronger cryptographic privacy. On the other hand, many backwards-compatible schemes have been proposed to obfuscate activity on the Bitcoin blockchain by mixing. Is anonymity a critical feature requiring built-in support that Bitcoin overlooked?  Inflation. Bitcoin's design seeks to avoid inflation, but many economists have pointed out it is actually deflationary, as eventually coins can only exit circulation when keys are lost (or coins are intentionally made unspendable via ""proof-of-burn"" transactions). Zero inflation actually requires a small amount of new currency issuance just to keep pace with lost currency. If this was a mistake in Bitcoin, we may not realize it for many years as inflation is slowly wound down.  The switch to transaction fees. Bitcoin hardcoded a slow transition from rewarding miners primarily by inflation to rewarding them primarily via transaction fees. Nobody knows how this will play out but some research suggests that this may cause significant instability in the post-inflation world.  Limited programmability. Bitcoin imposed severe limits on its programmability to keep transactions easy (and predictable in cost) to verify. The Ethereum project has demonstrated significant demand for a richer programming model, though its model introduces additional scaling concerns. Will Bitcoin be handicapped in the long run by its weaker programming model?

42429859,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM1wph,1540872012,The New Effort to Get Bitcoin's Lightning Network In Every Browser,"Touted as a way to make the world's most valuable cryptocurrency a more effective payment method, bitcoin's lightning network has a rather large obstacle ahead – it's still challenging, even risky, to set up and use.  It could become easier, though, should developers at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the prestigious international group that creates standards for the web, have anything to do with it.  The work, which has been ongoing for several years (since standards take a long time to release), looks to make online payments easier, while giving users more choice by making a variety of payment methods available in web browsers using an API – and that includes the lightning network.  We're talking browsers such as Google Chrome, Firefox and Microsoft Edge – big names everyone knows.  Sure, the W3C doesn't have a horse in the race as it relates to which payment methods – from credit cards to Apple Pay to cryptocurrencies – are adopted most widely, but giving developers the option of adding lightning is a step towards making bitcoin's layer-two more accessible.  Interest in cryptocurrency at the W3C's Web Payments Working Group (where the browser API work is taking place) has been high for some time. But the W3C had trouble at first getting bitcoin developers and other cryptocurrency enthusiasts involved in the work.  However, with the help of only a few developers, cryptocurrency is looking compatible with the API. And, further than that, lightning is already compatible with the specification.  ""All in all, we should be able to get bitcoin and lightning working with the [specification] without any major roadblocks,"" prominent lightning developer Christian Decker told other developers in an email in August. In fact, Decker, an engineer at Blockstream, specifically joined the Web Payments Working Group to make sure bitcoin and lightning would not be missed.  Such a step would put lightning on a similar footing as more established online payment methods, Decker told CoinDesk, adding:  ""This is exciting because switching between traditional payments and bitcoins and lightning payments could basically be a single click and make it easier for merchants to accept bitcoin alongside these traditional methods.""  Plus, there are other advantages to getting lightning into the specification.  Whenever a user enters their payment information, whether that's their credit card number and expiration date or their lightning information, the API saves that information to the browser for easy payment the next time.  A passive strategy  Still, there is work to be done to make this happen.  For one, Decker said that a so-called ""payment method ID"" must be assigned to bitcoin and lightning before it can be a functioning part of the API.  ""Currently only the basic-card identifier has been assigned, but we can apply for one eventually,"" he said.  Decker seems in no rush. According to him, lightning developers are taking a passive approach, watching developments within the Web Payments Working Group ""very closely"" to ensure that lightning remains compatible.  ""By being part of the working group we are in a position to raise objections should an incompatibility emerge and we [can] propose alternatives or improvements that better reflect the constraints that come from bitcoin and lightning being very unique payment systems,"" Decker told CoinDesk.  It's important to emphasize, though, that members don't have to do anything as a part of the working group – it's all rather voluntary.  And not everyone in the working group will necessarily have ""crypto"" top of mind. For instance, a bunch of companies contribute loosely to the W3C payment specifications, including the likes of Airbnb, Apple, Google, Facebook and Visa, companies that might be looking to push adoption of other, more obviously beneficial for their businesses, payment methods.  Decker is the sole lightning representative in the group of 172 participants.  As such, even though lightning is compatible, it's still up to the browsers and merchants to actually add lightning support.  Still, Ian Jacobs, the W3C payments activity head, argued these types of payments will be an option, telling CoinDesk:  ""The architecture is designed to enable new payment methods to be used on the web. That should include blockchain-based payment methods.""  Ready for the code?  Turning the W3C standards into code is another key step for pushing lightning into the browser.  Some browsers, including Chrome, Microsoft Edge (formerly Internet Explorer), Samsung browser and Safari have already put the API into practice, while Firefox uses it in ""beta,"" meaning it's not quite stable yet.  But so far, none have adopted the cryptocurrency or lightning part of the specifications.  That's likely partly because the specifications are still in progress. Not to mention, a developer needs to build the actual code implementation for the lightning payments, Decker said.  ""I'm not aware of any real implementation, but that would be a very welcome development, and I'd be more than happy to support it,"" he told CoinDesk.  One concern, though, is that lightning is so new and experimental, users have been known to lose money when sending a payment across the network. In other words, lightning still has a ways to go to even be safe to use – let alone easy. Bitcoin developer Sjors Provoost, who's been thinking about how lightning in a browser might look, raised this concern in a comment on the project's GitHub.  ""Bitcoin and lightning wallets are much more involved than just storing a credit card number in a browser,"" Provoost contended.  Yet Decker argued:  ""I'd say that using bitcoin or lightning payments are probably safer than credit cards.""
