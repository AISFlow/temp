This is thanks to the increasing positive user sentiment around the Ethereum Layer 2 network. However, the most recent development on the network could pose a threat to this recovery trend. Optimism Announces Third Airdrop After completing two rounds of airdrops already this year, the Optimism network has moved on to its third airdrop. This time around, the network is looking to reward loyal Optimism users who have delegated their OP to be used to participate in governance on the network. Related Reading: How Much Will Dogecoin Trade At If It Attains The Market Cap Of Bitcoin Or Ethereum? In its announcement, the team revealed that the latest iteration of its airdrop reward system would see 19 million OP tokens distributed to 31,000 unique addresses on the network. The airdrop distribution began on Monday, September 18, with the tokens being sent directly to the wallets of eligible users. The requirement was to have delegated OP tokens between January 20 to July 20 to receive the airdrop. To sweeten the pot, the airdrop applies a 2x multiplier to those who had delegated their tokens to individuals who were active voters. As for those who were ineligible to receive the latest round of airdrops, the team assured the community that more would be coming as 19% of the total OP token supply is dedicated to airdrops. What’s next? Eligible addresses are in the process of receiving OP for Airdrop #3. 🚨 There is no need to claim this airdrop. Do not interact with any site asking you to do so. 🚨 If you missed out, don’t worry—19% of the total initial supply of OP is dedicated to airdrops. — Optimism (✨🔴_🔴✨) (@optimismFND) September 18, 2023 Will This Affect OP Price? The value of the total OP tokens being distributed in the third airdrop comes out to around $26 million. This means that $26 million worth of tokens are making their way into the open market. Only half of the participants selling their allocation could see a $13 million selling pressure on the price of the digital asset. Now, if there is not enough demand to suck up this new supply, then the sellers will win and the OP price will drop drastically. This is already being manifested in Optimism’s performance in the last day which is already moving into the red with 0.24% losses. As more users receive and access their tokens, the selling pressure could climb rapidly. Related Reading: Ethereum Surges Ahead Of Bitcoin In Active Addresses, What Does This Mean? However, given that users are being rewarded for holding and delegating their tokens, it could spark an urge to hold onto the OP tokens among those who receive them in an effort to qualify for future airdrops. In such a case, the OP price will hold firmly and shake off any bear pressure. OP is already seeing increased interest which has translated to a 40% increase in its daily trading volume, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Its price is also holding tentatively at $1.40 as investors wait for the market to react.

17847062,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=552027,1695160841,"Stellar To Release Protocol 20 Testnet Upgrade, Will XLM Rally?","On September 20, Stellar, a blockchain platform designed to facilitate fast and low-cost cross-border transactions using its native currency, XLM, will release the testnet upgrade of Protocol 20. With this launch, the protocol prepares for the eventual mainnet activation of the Soroban smart contracts platform. Stellar Prepares For Protocol 20 And Smart Contracts According to a document on September 18, the testnet upgrade aims to release candidate versions of Stellar Core and Horizon. Stellar is a blockchain network and relies on a network of nodes for transaction validation and to ensure the network is secure. Validators running are kept in sync using the Stellar Core since it acts as the backbone of the entire network, safeguarding the integrity of the blockchain. Related Reading: Arbitrum: What’s In Store For ARB Token After Unlock? Stellar Horizon is an interface that simplifies interaction between applications and developers with the mainnet through APIs. By eliminating the complexities of interacting with the blockchain, Horizon makes it easier for users to deploy applications. Once the stable version is released, Validators will vote on the day when tested upgrades are integrated into the mainnet. The blockchain developer has acknowledged that the Protocol 20 upgrade will bring about new settings, which will require more discussion and adjustments through voting. The Stellar Network will provide a timeline for implementing these changes before rolling them out on the mainnet. Soroban And The $100 Million Incentive Stellar describes Soroban as a smart contracts platform designed for “scale and sensibility” and “integrates with and works alongside the existing Stellar blockchain.” The portal is currently being tested in Stellar’s testnet, Futurenet. Stellar claims that some of the network’s core features, such as multi-core scaling and an optimized fee model, make their smart contracts superior since all the “pesky serialization loops” have been eliminated.

The crypto custody firm, which filed for bankruptcy in August, disclosed on Sept. 14 the possible layoffs to the DETR, a document from the agency shows. A month earlier, CoinDesk reported, citing people familiar with the matter, that massive layoffs loomed.  It is unclear what percentage of the company's workforce the 62 workers account for as the company's current headcount is unknown. (A bankruptcy filing says the company had 70 full-time employees and contractors as of Aug. 14.) It’s also not clear the degree to which potential job losses cited in CoinDesk’s Aug. 11 story were reflected in this notice.  Prime Trust was not immediately available to respond to CoinDesk's request for comment.  Under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act, employers must inform their employees of ""mass layoffs"" or plant closings at least 60 days in advance of those events.  Prime Trust filed for bankruptcy in August, roughly two months after Nevada regulators alleged the company was unable to meet its customers' withdrawal requests. The company also used customer funds to invest in failed stablecoin project Terra, in addition to engaging in other dubious business practices, a court filing shows.

ETH-BTC dipped to near 0.0602 on Tuesday, according to TradingView data, its lowest reading since July.  The recent price action extended a trend that began in September 2022, confirming some bearish forecasts from analysts for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.  Marcus Thielen, head of strategy and research at Matrixport, said Monday on CoinDeskTV that Ethereum’s protocol revenues have been decreasing for the last three months, and expected BTC to continue outperforming the broader crypto market, including ETH.  Popular crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen, founder of IntoTheCryptoverse, noted in an X post that a potential breakdown in the ETH’s valuation versus BTC could be in the cards.  Large ETH investors on the move  The latest slide in price occurred as some prominent investors – also known as whales – have recently deposited a total of $60 million ETH to crypto exchanges, raising alarms about further declines in price.  Market participants closely follow the on-chain maneuvers of whales, as they are considered well-informed and have a sizable impact on the market. Depositing assets to an exchange usually signals intention to sell, while withdrawals suggest accumulation.  Most recently, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin transferred 300 ETH – worth roughly $493,000 – to Kraken on Tuesday, according to blockchain data noted by security firm PeckShield. While the deposit is rather small, it spurred speculation among crypto watchers given Buterin’s stature for Ethereum.  Another large holder deposited a total of 30,000 ETH – worth nearly $50 million – to crypto exchanges Binance, OKX and KuCoin over the past four days, blockchain sleuth Lookonchain noted.  Lookonchain also pointed out that a crypto wallet that acquired tokens from Ethereum’s initial coin offering (ICO) nine years ago deposited Monday 6,000 ETH – worth just shy of $10 million – to Kraken.  This entity received roughly 255,000 ETH during the ICO, now worth $423 million Lookonchain noted.

Gox Rumors, But QCP Capital Targets $22,000","The cryptocurrency market, notably dominated by Bitcoin, has always been a terrain of speculation and market sentiment. Rumors and speculations have surfaced with Bitcoin’s recent slight uptick in value. Market insiders point towards the potential delay of the Mt. Gox repayments as a key driver. However, QCP Capital, a crypto trading firm, remains skeptical about a sustained rally and holds a bearish outlook, indicating that global economic factors could play against the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Crypto Fund Flows: Millions Exit Bitcoin, But These Three Coins Hold Their Ground Mt. Gox Delay Rumors Fuel Bitcoin Rally Mt. Gox, the once-dominant Bitcoin exchange that faced a sudden downfall in 2014, is back in the news. With the April deadline for its creditors to submit repayment information having passed, there was an expectation of repayments by the end of October. But recent rumors suggest a delay in this timeline to 2024. These speculations seem to have significantly influenced Bitcoin’s price dynamics. QCP Capital, in its market analysis, notes: A large reason we’re seeing for this bounce is rumors of a Mt. Gox delay to 2024. The trading firm believes many might have taken a short position expecting repayments soon, and any official delay announcement might spur a considerable short squeeze in the market. However, the very nature of this rally has made experts cautious. Mt. Gox has a sizable cache of assets set for distribution, including 142,000 BTC (worth approximately $3.9 billion), 143,000 BCH, and 69 billion Japanese yen. Such a vast amount entering the market might create unpredictable price movements. QCP Capital’s Cautionary Stance Despite the recent price rally, QCP Capital’s forecast for Bitcoin remains bearish. The firm is still eyeing the $22,000 mark for BTC in the forthcoming month. They expect this uptick to be “short-lived,” with global risks looming over the cryptocurrency market in the fourth quarter. Further dissecting the market movements, QCP mentioned: The current Wave 2 of our C Wave expanded flat has so far bounced which we expected, but we still need to see the crucial Wave 3 that breaks the local lows for our count to be intact. A break above $32,000 would invalidate their current assessment, according to the firm. While the imminent Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) interest rate decision looms large, QCP sees a parallel to the market conditions of 2020, right before the infamous Covid crash. Although there’s market speculation around a potential volatility squeeze, QCP believes that a pause in rate hikes by the FOMC is the more likely outcome. But challenges persist, “At the same time, we do not see how Powell can assuredly call an end to this hiking cycle,” the firm adds, pointing to rising inflation and other economic factors. Additionally, concerns about a potential US government shutdown and increasing oil prices add to the economic uncertainty. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Next Move: Crypto Analyst Predicts $45,000 Price Ahead Of Halving In QCP’s assessment, the stock market might witness a downturn without Federal Reserve intervention, potentially dragging Bitcoin with it.

The FOMC’s next meeting is at the start of November, and investors are currently pricing in a 70% chance of continued steady policy. An unexpectedly hawkish lean to the updated economic projections or Powell comments could serve as a negative catalyst to both crypto and traditional markets.

The crypto community remains skeptical about employing the new stablecoin for daily crypto payments and has opted for top competitor stablecoins like USDT and USDC. PYUSD Experiences Sluggish Adoption Rate Global payments giant PayPal released its transparency report for its stablecoin, PYUSD, and the analysis of the report reveals that the PYUSD stablecoin may not be seeing as much adoption as PayPal and PYUSD stablecoin issuer, Paxos hoped for. Paypal launched the US dollar-backed stablecoin on August 7 which was designed to increase stablecoin offerings and facilitate the adoption of crypto payments to crypto users as well as consumers and merchants actively utilizing PayPal’s financial platform globally. Related Reading: Ripple CTO Explains Company’s Stance On Debunking Outrageous XRP Price Predictions However, despite coming from one of the largest players in the payments space, the PYUSD stablecoin remains a relatively small player in the cryptocurrency market, especially when compared to industry heavyweights like Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC). A Kaiko analyst, Desislava Aubert stated to Decrypt that despite being listed on prominent exchange platforms like Coinbase and Huobi Global, the PYUSD stablecoin’s adoption rate has been progressing slowly, and its daily trade volumes have been fairly low. “PYUSD was listed on some centralized exchanges in late August, notably Coinbase and Kraken, but its daily trading volume has been volatile and significantly lower than other stablecoins. Overall, this points to sluggish demand,” Aubert stated. The PayPal USD stablecoin was issued by Paxos Trust Company, a technology company specializing in blockchain in August. Paxos has reported that it holds $45.3 million in assets supporting the PYUSD stablecoin. The stablecoin is also reportedly backed with over $1.5 million in cash deposits. The majority of the coin’s reserves, approximately $43.8 million have been collateralized with the US Treasuries as reverse purchase agreements. Currently, PYUSD has a market capitalization of $44 million, suggesting that the stablecoin’s adoption rate has been subpar due to its failure to catch and retain the attention of the crypto community. Crypto Investors Opt For Top Stablecoins The decline in acceptance and adoption of the PYUSD may be attributed to the unfamiliarity of the cryptocurrency as a new stablecoin. The stablecoin market is also heavily saturated with well-established cryptocurrencies like USDT, USDC, and others. Given this, a large number of crypto investors are presently opting for these top stablecoins to facilitate their cryptocurrency transactions. This is further propelled by the fact that these stablecoins have created a considerable reputation for themselves over the years due to their reliability and sustainability. Related Reading: Incoming Milestone Could Be Very Bullish For XRP Price, Here’s Why Presently, USDT has a market capitalization of over $83 billion and USDC has a market cap of $26 billion. At the time of writing, USDT stablecoin’s 24-hour trading volume is over $22 billion as compared to PYUSD stablecoin’s 24-hour trading volume of only $3.2 million. Despite PYUSD’s sluggish adoption rate, PayPal remains committed to its cryptocurrency ventures. The payment giant has expanded into different regions globally using its brand name and reliable reputation as an international financial service provider to facilitate crypto adoption and awareness among users in different countries.

42392540,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg8735,1695151901,"SEC’s Crypto Enforcement Chief Warns More Charges Coming to Exchanges, DeFi","The regulator's crypto enforcer made broad assertions that the SEC has more in store for the crypto industry.  Still, David Hirsch acknowledged that the agency's current litigation load is heavy, and the SEC can't go after everything.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) isn’t done chasing down crypto exchanges and decentralized finance (DeFi) projects it sees as violating securities laws in the same vein as Coinbase Inc. (COIN) and Binance, said David Hirsch, head of the agency’s Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit.  His enforcement office, which has been litigating at a very unusual pace for the SEC, is aware of and investigating other firms involved in much the same activity seen at those two major platforms and that the industry’s compliance breeches “hold true well beyond any two entities,” Hirsch said Tuesday at the Securities Enforcement Forum Central in Chicago.  “We’re going to continue to bring those charges,” said Hirsch, who said the regulator has a number of other businesses on its radar that are operating in similar ways to Coinbase and Binance. His agency is already embroiled in a number of complex crypto cases in federal courts, and – as seen in its effort to appeal a recent Ripple ruling – not always with complete success.  Hirsch said the SEC’s interest in crypto goes well beyond the high-profile exchanges.  ""We're going to continue to be active as to intermediaries,” he said. “That can be brokers, dealers, exchanges, clearing agencies or any others who are active in this space, are within our jurisdiction and not meeting their obligations, either through registration or failure to provide adequate or complete disclosures.”  Hirsch said DeFi projects won’t escape the enforcement division’s attention, either.  “We're going to continue to conduct investigations, we're gonna be active in the space, and adding the label of DeFi is not going to be something that's going to deter us from continuing our work,” he said.  The U.S. securities regulator has previously been accustomed to a relatively sedate approach to enforcement, in which it targets misdeeds at regulated businesses – often large, Wall Street firms with extensive legal departments – that quickly begin negotiating settlements. Because the charges against digital assets companies routinely threaten their existence, they tend to take the agency to court.  The SEC has a finite enforcement budget that is often less than the financial giants it’s used to facing, so its bandwidth is limited.  “We do have a lot of litigation going on,” Hirsch conceded.  “It feels like you're at capacity,” observed the event’s moderator, A. Kristina Littman, who served as the SEC’s crypto enforcement chief before Hirsch and who now works at Willkie Farr & Gallagher.  Hirsch conceded that the SEC can only reach so far.

The expansion comes when the broader crypto market is recovering after crashing in recent weeks. The fact that the amount of coins owned by long-term holders is increasing could indicate a positive shift in sentiment. Long-term holders differ from speculators, who predict and gamble on price fluctuations for financial gain. Long-term holders are individuals or organizations that have kept their coins for at least 155 days. According to Glassnode, a blockchain analytics platform, the chances of these entities not spending after holding them for at least five months, is lower. Long-term holders, commonly known as “diamond hands,” can support crypto prices by removing coins from circulation. More Entities HODLing Bitcoin is inherently deflationary, and only 21 million coins will ever circulate. However, with mining, coins will be continuously added to circulation until all 21 million are mined by 2140. Presently, there are 19.49 million coins in circulation, of which a significant chunk is considered lost or irrecoverable.

42392541,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg86xx,1695149707,Does Coinbase Have a Diversification Problem?,"Coin Metrics latest “State of the Network” report takes a deep dive into Coinbase’s revenues, a perennially interesting subject for those looking to understand the crypto exchange market in the U.S. According to the latest figures, Coinbase has seen cash inflows diversify away from trading fees, which for years accounted for upwards of 90% of the exchange’s revenues.  Looking at its most recent quarterly earnings report, Coinbase reported revenues of $707 million with $327 million coming from spot trading. While still the largest source of cash flows, fees now account for just 77% of its total revenues. Other business lines including subscription fees for a pro product as well as wallet, staking and on-chain scaling services are an increasingly large share of the pie.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Why not milk the cash cow forever? Well, Coinbase has historically been able to charge above-market trading fees as perhaps the most trustworthy U.S. exchange and because U.S. crypto users are not really supposed to be using cheaper, overseas competitors.  This situation isn’t exactly about to change anytime soon – even despite the firm’s ongoing U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) lawsuit (then, what fintech hasn’t been dinged by the SEC?). But it does mean Coinbase has limited runway for growth, which is concerning considering its global expansion has been hit or miss and recent rollbacks in markets including Japan and India.  There are still plenty of Coinbase bulls in the world, not even counting the firm’s largest stock holder Cathie Wood. The Coin Metrics folks seemed to end on a positive note, including thoughts on a number of potential business lines with growth potential including a tie up with MakerDAO, revenues from USDC as well as its nascent derivatives push.  But in face of the growing narrative around Coinbase’s seemingly successful push towards diversification, I want to bring in a dose of reality: Coinbase’s total revenues from trading fees are down because trading fees are down. Period. If this were a year as frenzied as 2021, I’m sure the seemingly growing sectors like sequencer fees and staking-as-a-service would be a pittance in comparison.  Let’s not forget the realities that tether Coinbase to its U.S. customer base, which is the same reason why CEO Brian Armstrong’s threats to move overseas fall hollow (and why Coinbase’s media team tried to roll back the tape). I believe Brad Garlinghouse when he said he would take Ripple overseas, because he’s a madman who plays with fire like selling hundreds of millions of dollars of XRP in transactions that clearly resemble (but are not always) securities offerings.  But is Coinbase trapped? Can it grow or acquire its way out of its current situation?  Here’s a non-geographical non-growth story: Despite there now being over 600 asset pairs on Coinbase, Coin Metrics found that coins and tokens listed earlier in the company’s history – like bitcoin and ether – still account for the bulk of volumes.  “[S]imply adding new assets isn’t a guaranteed way of generating trading fee revenues,” the researchers write.  See also: The 3 Things Coinbase Says Will Determine the Future of Crypto  Depending on how you look at it, this could be ominous for Coinbase’s future growth or simply a matter of common sense. ETH and BTC are the two largest networks, but that hasn’t prevented, say, Solana from finding a user base. Not every token will be a winner, but presumably unless something catastrophic happens recent launches like Sui and Aptos will find uses and users too.  And it’s not like “adding more tokens” is really a game plan for dealing with a protracted bear market. The issue isn’t the coins, but the lack of users – hence Coinbase’s drop in relative trading fees.  Thankfully for the company, attempts to expand into staking as well as L2 rollup operations via its recently launched Base has seen early success. For Coin Metrics, this bodes well for the future of on-chain activities. Better yet for Coinbase is the extractive returns it earns on staking commissions, used by retail and institutional traders. Ethereum staking accounts for over 13% of the exchange’s net revenues, and it’s all essentially passive income after the initial software and hardware costs.  To be fair, Coinbase’s staking operation is flying in the face of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) “Wells Notice” and legal concerns meaning it could one day be unplugged.  I’d reckon similar risks stand for the Ethereum scaling layer Base, which is fully monetized by Coinbase as the only validator earning sequencer fees for validating transactions. While Base is not yet a target for Gensler’s SEC, it is becoming a money-maker for Coinbase in part because of the surprising success of the social-media platform Friend.tech.  See also: Coinbase Joins the Ethereum Layer 2 Rat Race  But Base comes with clearer expenses, like the data rollups to mainnet Ethereum, which sometimes, amazingly account for over 1% of all ETH fees paid per day.  Are all of the business lines Coinbase is or could conceivably become involved in pyrrhic? Somehow, yes. For instance, Coinbase is being tapped for a number of bitcoin ETF proposals that, if approved, could eat into its bitcoin trading market.  I’m mostly kidding about that last point, and Coinbase is still sitting pretty on a massively successful exchange business, nascent staking platform and backer of USDC (which literally prints money via interest earned on deposits).  But considering the restrictions on its possible growth, it’s no surprise that Brian Armstrong is spending his free time thinking about hail mary startup ideas like ""on-chain ads,"" putting the real world on-chain and something called “flatcoin.” I mean, it’s not exactly like innovation investor Cathie Wood is going to hear that Coinbase’s business plan is essentially “mess around, find out” and be upset.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/09/19/does-coinbase-have-a-diversification-problem,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c3038e2e22a606fd790078c6d881f8bc12e11bd0-1102x622.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

17840753,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=551989,1695146420,"Here’s Where Next Bitcoin Resistance Lies, From An On-Chain Perspective","Here’s where the next major resistance to clear Bitcoin could lie from the perspective of on-chain analysis. Bitcoin Resistances According To On-Chain Data Bitcoin has recently observed a surge beyond the $27,000 mark, and many have been wondering how long this fresh rally could continue for the cryptocurrency. One way to determine this could perhaps be by looking at where the major resistance levels are. In terms of on-chain analysis, “resistance” generally lies in regions where many investors have their cost basis present because of how holder psychology tends to work. The “cost basis” here refers to the average price at which an investor buys coins. When the spot price is below a holder’s cost basis, they are in a net amount of loss. Once BTC returns to the investor’s acquisition price, they may want to sell, as at least that way, they would have avoided exiting at any losses. Due to this reason, whenever a large number of investors have their cost basis present inside a particular price range, the range could provide resistance to the asset because of the volume of selling pressure that may arise in it. Related Reading: How Much Will Dogecoin Trade At If It Attains The Market Cap Of Bitcoin Or Ethereum? Now, here is what the different Bitcoin price ranges look like in terms of investor cost basis concentration, according to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock: The different support and resistance levels according to on-chain data | Source: IntoTheBlock on X As displayed above, the following particularly thick cost basis range is $25,853 to $29,662. “Key resistance is anticipated around $29.2K — a point of acquisition for over 1.77M addresses,” explains IntoTheBlock. The $27,200 to $28,000 range (the range just after the current spot price of the cryptocurrency) isn’t exactly thin, either, but it has notably fewer investors than the other one. The following range, $28,000 to $28,853, doesn’t have many investors, so if BTC can clear the upcoming range, the run-up to nearly $29,000 may be clear. Related Reading: Next Bitcoin Peak: Why It Could Still Be 2 Years Away While investor cost basis can act as resistance on retests from below, they can also support when being touched from up. The reason behind this could be that an investor that had earlier been in profits might have reason to believe the asset would go up again, so they might buy more at their cost basis, thinking it to be a profitable entry point. From the image, it’s apparent that both the ranges just below the current price are very thick with addresses because Bitcoin had earlier consolidated at these price levels for a significant time. It might be due to these strong support levels that when the asset had retraced back to $26,600 yesterday, it quickly found a rebound to the current price level. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around the $27,200 level, up 4% during the past seven days.

42392562,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg882d,1695144600,Crypto Wants a De Minimis Tax Exemption in the U.S.,"Earlier this month, representatives of the crypto industry filed responses to the Senate Finance Committee’s request for comment on tax rules around digital assets.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Tax rules  The narrative  The leaders of the Senate Finance Committee, Sens. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) published an open letter in July asking the crypto industry to weigh in on crypto tax issues, including loans, staking, mining, constructive sales and wash trading. These comments were due earlier this month.  Why it matters  The Senate Finance Committee oversees tax issues. The fact that it’s overseeing a public comment period is a first step toward potential legislation or hearings on crypto taxation in the U.S., an area the industry views as a barrier to broader adoption or usage.  Breaking it down  July’s letter also asked about a de minimis rule and foreign reporting requirements, setting a Sept. 8 deadline for responses. The de minimis rule refers to a capital gains tax exemption on realized gains below a certain threshold.  A number of crypto entities proposed some similar suggestions they hope the lawmakers will adopt: taxing cryptocurrencies generated via staking (i.e. staking rewards) at the point they’re sold, rather than as income when they’re generated; clarifying rules around wash trading and, of course, the de minimis rules themselves.  “Unlike traditional government-issued currencies, property does not enjoy a de minimis exemption. This is in contrast to how foreign currencies are treated, which do enjoy an exemption,” a letter authored by Coin Center said. “... This means that every time you buy a cup of coffee or anything else with bitcoin, it counts as a taxable event. If you have experienced a gain because the price of bitcoin has appreciated between the time you acquired the bitcoin and the time you used it, you have to report it to the IRS at the end of the year, no matter how small the gain. Obviously this creates a lot of friction and discourages the use of bitcoin or any cryptocurrency as an everyday payment method.”  Similarly, industry lobbyists at the Blockchain Association wrote that treating crypto like a medium of exchange carries “significantly different” tax burdens compared to treating crypto as an investment.  People transacting frequently could create a “logistical nightmare” of transactions they would have to track and report, the letter said.  The Crypto Council for Innovation, another industry group, took aim at a proposed White House excise tax on miners, saying it should apply to all industry energy users if it’s intended to address environmental issues.  “Unlike most other energy-intensive industries, digital asset mining has the advantage of being able to easily toggle operations off and on,” the letter said.  The DeFi Education Fund (DEF) similarly advocated for rules around crypto loans (using specifically fungible tokens) analogous to rules around loans of securities.  Both the DEF and Coin Center also argued that Section 6050I of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021 (i.e. the bipartisan infrastructure bill) may not be workable for all parties. The provision requires any individual who receives more than $10,000 in crypto over the course of a tax year to report personally identifying information about the senders, which might not be possible given how many crypto transactions are pseudonymous.  Coin Center sued the U.S. Treasury Department over the provision.  As the deadline for industry comment letters passed a mere 11 days ago, the next steps remain to be seen.

42392555,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg87xV,1695143493,Binance’s Bitcoin Trading Volume Plunges 57% as Regulatory Pressure Mounts,"Bitcoin (BTC) trading volumes on Binance have tumbled this month as lawsuits and regulatory scrutiny mount on the world’s largest crypto exchange.  According to K33 Research, Binance’s 7-day average spot BTC volume is down 57% since the beginning of September versus roughly flat readings at a number of other exchanges. Volumes at U.S.-based competitor Coinbase are higher by 9% over this period.  The dramatic decline comes as Binance is in the crosshairs of regulators around the world following a string of lawsuits, license rejections and voluntary withdrawals. Prosecutors at the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) are reportedly weighing charges against the company, while the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) three months ago sued Binance, the exchange’s U.S entity Binance.US and founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, alleging multiple federal securities laws.  “The ongoing DOJ and SEC cases vs. Binance may have dissuaded market makers from trading on Binance, explaining parts of the decline,” K33 Research senior analyst Vetle Lunde said. “Some market making has probably leaked to other exchanges, but it's still almost certain that Binance's woes negatively impact market volumes,” he added.  Binance curbed on Sep. 7 its zero-fee promotion for BTC trading with TrueUSD (TUSD) stablecoin, one of the most liquid trading pairs on the platform, which may have contributed to the decline.  Binance.US also suffered from an exodus in trading activity. Data from crypto analytics firm Kaiko shows that the weekly overall trading volume on that platform dropped to $40 million from what was nearly $5 billion earlier this year, a roughly 99% decrease.

42392537,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg86nh,1695143302,"Sam Bankman-Fried’s Dad Thought His Son Wasn’t Paying Him Enough, So He Got Mom Involved","A recent court filing in FTX’s bankruptcy case suggests a unique family dynamic in how Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto companies were managed.  Joe Bankman, his father, was initially paid a $200,000 salary by FTX. However, he expressed discontent, expecting $1 million annually, and involved his wife, Barbara Fried, in the matter.  Following this, the couple received significant financial benefits, including a $10 million gift and a $16.4 million property in The Bahamas, both linked to FTX funds.  The filing indicates that Bankman viewed Alameda Research, a central firm in the crypto empire, as a “family business.”  “Just wait until mom hears about this.”  For any kid, this might not be an appealing set of words for a father to utter.  Some version of that warning, though, allegedly played a behind-the-scenes role in how Sam Bankman-Fried’s once-$32 billion crypto giant was run, according to a new court filing in the company’s bankruptcy case.  Bankman-Fried’s dad, Joe Bankman, was paid a $200,000 salary by FTX’s U.S. division, according to the filing from FTX’s bankruptcy estate, which just sued Bankman-Fried's parents to claw back money. But that wasn’t enough, the father said, telling an FTX executive in a Jan. 12, 2022, message that he was supposed to get $1 million annually starting the previous month.  Gee, Sam I don’t know what to say here … Putting [your mom] on this.  Then he emailed his son. “Gee, Sam I don’t know what to say here,” he wrote, according to the filing. “This is the first [I] have heard of the 200K a year salary! Putting Barbara on this.”  Barbara is Joe Bankman’s wife and former FTX CEO Bankman-Fried’s mom, Barbara Fried.  “Bankman’s influence paid off, not only for him, but for Fried too,” FTX’s bankruptcy estate said in the Monday filing. “Within two weeks, Bankman-Fried gifted Bankman and Fried together $10 million in funds originating from Alameda Ltd. Within three months, Bankman-Fried caused the couple to be deeded a $16.4 million property in The Bahamas paid for with funds ultimately provided by FTX Trading.”  Elsewhere in the document, there’s another assertion that Bankman-Fried’s parents played a key role in his business. As early as 2018, Bankman called Alameda Research – the trading firm Bankman-Fried founded that played a central role in the empire’s demise – a “family business,” a label he used repeatedly, according to the filing.  It was already known Bankman-Fried’s inner circle played big roles at his companies, but this latest revelation suggests an unusual family dynamic – a parent taking advantage of their unique leverage over their child – was also possibly at play.  As CoinDesk revealed last year, Bankman-Fried’s roommates were senior executives, including ex-girlfriend Caroline Ellison, who ran FTX’s sister company, Alameda Research. And, even before the empire’s November 2022 collapse, it was known that Bankman-Fried’s dad was involved with FTX.  Referring to the lawsuit brought Monday against Bankman and Fried, their two attorneys told CoinDesk: “This is a dangerous attempt to intimidate Joe and Barbara and undermine the jury process just days before their child’s trial begins. These claims are completely false. [John J. Ray III, FTX’s bankruptcy-era CEO] and his massive team of lawyers, who are collectively running up countless millions of dollars in fees while returning relatively little to FTX clients, know better.”  Amitoj Singh contributed reporting to this story.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | TRADING | RESEARCH,Nick Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/09/19/sam-bankman-frieds-dad-thought-his-son-wasnt-paying-him-enough-so-he-got-mom-involved,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/eb4a867b1ad12ef8ecdc620d7f2abc12801cfc8c-793x446.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to the X post made on September 18, Rexyz outlines an alternative solution that may lead to USTC being re-valued $1 as well as push Terra Classic (LUNC) price to reach the $1 price mark. Since the collapse of the Terra ecosystem in 2022, the USTC stablecoin has lost its dollar peg and now trades at 98.8% below the $1 mark. Following this catastrophic event, members of the Terra Class community have continued to submit various proposals to burn more USTC contains as a deflationary mechanism that could result in the stablecoin recovering its dollar peg. Currently, the Terra Classic community is voting on a proposal that aims to direct the Binance exchange to start burning 50% of USTC every month. It is believed that if the world’s biggest exchange aids in reducing the circulating supply of USTC, it could significantly boost the token’s rise to $1. Related Reading: How Terra Luna Classic Token Burn May Drive LUNC And USTC To $1 A Reverse Split Is More Efficient Than Buring Tokens, Community Member Says According to Rexyx, burning USTC tokens may not be the best way of regaining the stablecoin’s dollar peg. The Terra Classic community member explains that there are currently 9.8 billion USTC tokens in circulation, and users will need to burn massive amounts of USTC to record any significant rise in value. Alternatively, Rexyz proposes that the Terra community implements a reverse split of the USTC token, which leads to a revaluation of the stablecoin, albeit at some investment cost. In this proposal, Rexyz gives an example, stating that if 100 USTC is the current equivalent of $1, a 100/1 reverse split would convert 100 USTC to just one USTC token, which will now be valued at $1. Through this mechanism, USTC holders retain their holdings’ current value, and there is no need to burn more tokens. However, Rexyz notes that a reverse split would erase all existing network debt. This means that USTC investors will have to forfeit whatever losses incurred during the collapse of the Terra ecosystem. Could A USTC Reverse Split Rescue The Terra Classic Ecosystem? Interestingly, Rexyz also stated that the revaluation of the USTC token could initiate a recovery of the Terra Classic network. The community member explained that once USTC regains its dollar peg and the LUNC-USTC swap mechanism is tested with the implementation of improved capital controls, investors can start burning trillions of LUNC. Related Reading: USTC Surprises With Nearly 60% Rally – What’s Going On? Rexyx believes this will lead to a massive rise in LUNC’s value, and the altcoin may even record new all-time highs. Rexyz advises the Terra community to implement the reverse split of USTC and “pin” their hopes of recovering past losses by investing in LUNC, which also lost 99.9% of its market value in 2022. However, the Terra classic community member states this initiative should executed upon research and approval by the relevant experts.

42392539,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg86sp,1695141799,"Eventually, We Are All Ethereum","Ethereum is eating all the blockchains. That’s fine.  If history is a prologue, then Ethereum is going to eat the entire blockchain sector and everything that is not Ethereum will eventually become an Ethereum Layer 2. I believe the recent decision by CELO stakeholders to shift into operating as an Ethereum Layer 2 is just the beginning of an avalanche of similar integrations and shifts that lead us to an end-state where Ethereum ultimately operates as the Layer 1 for all blockchains.  Paul Brody is EY's global blockchain leader and a CoinDesk columnist.  There is ample precedent for this kind of consolidation in the technology industry, and one of my favorite examples is how an immensely diverse world of networks slowly but surely converged upon a single global standard over a period of about 15 years.  The networking story goes like this: A long time ago, roughly around the dawn of human civilization (in the 1970s), we had lots of different data networks. All kinds of them for a whole range of companies and governments from the U.S. Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET), the precursor of the internet, to IBM’s Systems Network Architecture (SNA), Xerox’s Internetwork Datagram Protocol (IDP) and several others. The result was a veritable alphabet soup of incompatible networks that made connecting business and government systems extremely difficult.  From connectivity glue to global standard  Starting in the 1970s, a concerted effort was made to create a protocol that could work across multiple networks and smoothly handle interruptions and changes in network operation. The result was TCP/IP, which stood for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol. In the early days, TCP/IP did exactly what it was supposed to do: connect all these different networks.  At first, TCP/IP was just supposed to connect different networking standards, a job it did very well. Over time, however, the inexorable logic of standardization and scale turned TCP/IP from connectivity glue into a global standard. IP Networks ate up the networking business and today, there are virtually no non-IP networks remaining.  Read more: Paul Brody - Decentralization Is the Point, and We’re Not Talking Enough About Why  Given how much the technology industry loves scaling around a standard, nobody should be surprised by this and, similarly, we should not be surprised if the same happens to blockchain networks. Since the value of any network grows with interconnection, this approach could very well become a lifeline for struggling Layer 1s that, only very recently, were touting themselves as “Ethereum Killers.”  Layer 2 specialized networks  Not all Layer 2s and sidechains are alike, and lately I have been thinking about what are the different ways in which this Layer 2 ecosystem could develop. There are a number of highly specialized sub-ecosystems that could emerge. For example at EY, we are targeting industrial companies as users of our OpsChain solutions to help manage inventory and track carbon emissions. When we sit down and do scaling planning, the volumes we talk about are very large. For example, one of our clients is asking us to think about handling 500,000 units a day (all unique and serialized) for a single product line.  With those 500,000 units every day moving an average of three to four times between production and end consumption, we can think about an average of 2 million NFT transactions each day for a single product line. For these kinds of clients, the top priorities are privacy (keeping your detailed business operations data a secret from your competition) and scalability – they need reliably high throughput and low transaction costs. It will not surprise you that Nightfall, a Layer 2 network developed by EY and contributed into the public domain, is designed to do just that.  Make your peace and say your goodbyes to the cool specialized blockchains we live with today  Financial transactions will have very different Layer 2 requirements. Some, like swaps, may just be looking for very high volume, low-cost roll-ups, while complex Decentralized Finance (DeFi) smart contracts will also need networks that support full Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility so the smart contracts can run on the blockchain.  Nor will I be surprised to see the emergence of highly specialized national, regional, or verified identity networks where all the participants are not only known, but all are identified and subject to the same regulatory rules. Imagine a Layer 2 only open to Accredited Investors who are U.S. “persons” (citizens or residents). That would allow all these people to transact a very wide variety of assets with each other with a minimum of added verification checks. They could quickly emerge inside the EU or in other major jurisdictions.  The value of interconnection  With all these specialized networks emerging, you might be tempted to wonder if there is any point in interconnecting them all through Ethereum. The value of interconnection, beyond mere EVM compatibility, is the ability to flow products and services from one ecosystem to another. No real, modern economic system is truly isolated. Every commercial contract closes with payment and financial services, of one kind or another, underpin all of them. Financial flows between countries and ecosystems underpin all trade and investment.  Nor is it likely we can ever build a single network that can support all the different kinds of transactions and the volume that will serve the entire world. As a result, there will always be multiple networks and there will be friction involved in connections between networks, even when it is just between a Layer 1 and a Layer 2. Even so, having Ethereum as a binding Layer 1 across many specialized networks will offer enormous benefits.  For example, industrial product tokens can leave a specialty manufacturing network in exchange for payment that comes from a finance-focused Layer 2, but the ability to have a continuous digital record across two Layer 2 networks and connected by Ethereum as the Layer 1 is an order of magnitude more integrated than anything that exists in the commercial world today.  One downside of Ethereum eating the entire world is that similar to the networking industry today, there will be much less variability in some of the network functions that are available. To be interoperable, tokens and smart contracts will basically have to be the same everywhere. Every chain has to be an EVM chain. And while you can have cross-chain development systems that work on a diverse ecosystem, it is not very useful because your tokens and smart contracts become stranded and useless, and the unique and special functions of particular networks never actually get used.  One of the big lessons from the world of technology is that, over and over again, universal infrastructure is more successful than specialized infrastructure, even when the specialized infrastructure is actually better for a specific job. Before TCP/IP ate the entire world of networks, there used to be specialized networks just for voice calls. They were called circuit-switched networks and they guaranteed the quality of your phone call. No delays, no breaks, no lost packets, just a continuously connected circuit between two phones. By comparison, Voice Over IP phones calls are a huge step backwards in quality, but they now represent more than 99% of all phone calls anyway.  So, make your peace and say your goodbyes to the cool specialized blockchains we live with today. I’m betting they’ll be history soon enough.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY,Paul Brody,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/09/19/eventually-we-are-all-ethereum,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/68f98cb1d6310ef29ea0c6de65b652ef41a8366b-2309x1299.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Shiba Inu Team Member Tells Investors What To Do The content marketing specialist for Shiba Inu took to X on Monday, September 18, 2023, to address the Shiba Inu token burn questions coming from the community saying that SHIB burns are set per transaction, not based on tweets about burns. Related Reading: Ripple CTO Explains Company’s Stance On Debunking Outrageous XRP Price Predictions Lucie told the community that when will Shibarium initiate the SHIB burn is the wrong question and “The real question is, ‘when will you all migrate from exchanges and start using Shibarium?’” When will Shibarium initiate the SHIB burn?” Wrong question ☓ The real question is, “When will you all migrate from exchanges and start using Shibarium?” (hello DEFI, remember bankrupted exchanges like FTX) The burns are set per transaction, not based on tweets about burns.… — 𝐋𝐔𝐂𝐈𝐄 | ✨Shibarium✨ (@LucieSHIB) September 18, 2023 Lucie further explained that the Shiba Inu token burns through Shibarium is a collective effort from both the community and the Devs since the burns are based on transaction activity and real engagement from within the platform. She told the community that expecting burns to happen solely through transactions without active community participation is unrealistic. The marketing expert went on to highlight the security features of choosing Shibarium as an alternative to centralized crypto exchanges. She guaranteed SHIB holders that assets stored on the platform are just as safe as they would be on centralized crypto exchanges. She also stated that centralized crypto exchanges can be fragile using the case of the bankrupted centralized crypto platform FTX to back up her claims. So far, Lucie has urged the millions of SHIB holders to support this movement using Shibarium as an alternative to centralized crypto exchanges since each transaction on the platform contributes to the SHIB token burns. She also added that transaction fees are pretty low on the platform, but might increase in the future along with the higher traffic, which would translate to a higher number of SHIB being burned. SHIB price sees a slight recovery to $0.00000738 | Source: SHIBUSD on Tradingview.com Lucie also stretched her opinions to one of the most popular NFT marketplaces Opensea, inviting them to consider integrating Shibarium on the platform. Shibarium is a layer 2 blockchain built on the Ethereum network. It is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that was designed to serve as an alternative to centralized crypto exchanges which aims to provide a more sustainable and scalable infrastructure for Shiba Inu transactions. SHIB Price Predictions Following Shibarium’s Success For years now, Shiba Inu has been one of the most notable cryptocurrencies in the crypto market. The famous meme coin is likely to experience an upward trajectory if Shibarium becomes a success since it could catalyze a larger adoption and popularity of the SHIB tokens.

However, with the success of Shibarium and the new development on the platform, the SHIB token could grow up to $0.000050 by the end of 2023. Nevertheless, if the SHIB token manages to maintain this trajectory, during the next bull market the token could beat its all-time high price of $0.00008845 achieved in the 2021 bull market.

42392553,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg87sN,1695136805,Some Binance EU Users Find Fiat Withdrawals Cut Off Even Before Paysafe Ends Service,"A small proportion of Binance’s European users are unable to withdraw euros well ahead of the exchange’s regional payments provider Paysafe pulling support.  Binance says it was given short notice by Paysafe on early account closures for select clients, while the latter claims Binance is responsible for customer-facing issues.  Some Binance customers in the EU are blocked from withdrawing euros from the platform as a change in the crypto exchange’s regional payments provider looms.  Paysafe, Binance’s European payments partner, is set to end support for the exchange’s customers on Sept. 25. But several users in the region have been shut out from accessing the service well ahead of the deadline.  One, Ervin Ursic Kovac told CoinDesk that he’d sent some ether (ETH) to his account on Sept. 12 and sold it for euros, but was unable to withdraw the currency, and was instead greeted with a pop-up message that his account had been closed early with no prior warning. He had been able to withdraw euros on the previous day without issue, Ursic Kovac said.  “As a high-frequency Paysafe service user, Paysafe closed your account early to speed up this process. Any remaining EUR/GBP in your account can be withdrawn once the review is completed,” the message titled “Paysafe Notification” said.  Binance told CoinDesk on Monday that Paysafe had put a “very small portion” of users through an “earlier closure review.”  In a Friday statement to CoinDesk, Paysafe said it “cannot speculate in the media on why this particular customer is unable to make transactions and it is Binance who holds the relationship with the customer not Paysafe.”  The statement added that Paysafe services for Binance customers “are fully operational with our contractual and regulatory obligations.”  Paysafe did not respond to a Monday request for comment on why it had targeted certain accounts for early closure.  Ending support  Paysafe facilitated fiat deposits and withdrawals for Binance users in Europe, including via bank transfer in the EU’s Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA). In June, the payments provider said it will no longer offer its embedded wallet to Binance’s EU customers following a “strategic review” of the partnership. The move came after Paysafe pulled support for the British pound for new Binance users in May.  The crypto exchange has been facing increased regulatory scrutiny worldwide following last year’s market meltdown that revealed mismanagement of customer funds and regulatory arbitrage in several high-profile crypto enterprises – most notably at Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX.  Binance is also retreating – or in some cases, being made to retreat from – several European countries including Belgium and Austria over regulatory issues as it prepares to comply with the EU’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) rules coming into effect next year.  Early closure reviews  Paysafe will delay withdrawals for targeted users like Ursic Kovac until their accounts are reviewed, a spokesperson for Binance said in an emailed statement, adding that around 0.085% of Binance users with Paysafe accounts in Europe are affected.  Nothing had changed in the week that followed, Ursic Kovac said in a Monday email. “The worst part (besides not being able to control my own assets) is of course the price changes of ETH – because I am not able to buy it back, Binance is directly costing me money,” he said.  Binance said it was “very disappointed” with Paysafe’s short notice on the move to temporarily block some users.  “We're actively working to speed up the return of funds from Paysafe to all affected users. We will notify users immediately through the Binance app, along with a follow up email, once Paysafe informs us that reviews are complete,” the spokesperson said, adding that affected users have been offered VIP upgrade vouchers.  Ursic Kovac said on Tuesday that he had not received a VIP upgrade offer yet.

17836325,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=551931,1695135645,Bitcoin Rally Driven By Coinbase Users? Premium Would Say So,"The Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap has been positive during the past few days, implying the surge above $27,000 may be driven by the platform’s users. Coinbase Users Have Been Participating In Aggressive Bitcoin Buying Recently In a new post on X, the CryptoQuant Netherlands community manager, Maartunn, has pointed out how there appears to have been buying going on at Coinbase recently. The relevant indicator here is the “Coinbase Premium Gap,” which keeps track of the difference between the Bitcoin prices listed on the cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase and Binance. The former platform is more popular among US-based investors (including large institutional holders), while the latter receives more global traffic. As such, the Premium Gap’s value may provide insight into how the behaviors of these two audiences differ. When the value of this metric is positive, it means that the price on Coinbase is greater than that on Binance right now. This would imply that the American investors have either been applying a higher buying pressure or a lower selling pressure as compared to the global users. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Metric Continues To Retest Bear-Bull Junction, Will A Break Happen? Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap over the last few days: Looks like the value of the metric has been going up in recent days | Source: @JA_Maartun on X As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap had been negative earlier in the month, implying that Coinbase users had been selling more than Binance users. The metric had turned especially deep in the leadup to and during the plunge towards the $25,000 level, suggesting the selloff was driven by the American holders. During the recovery that had followed, the Premium Gap had turned positive, but only after a delay, implying that the US-based investors didn’t initially contribute towards the surge. Since then, however, the indicator has remained at notable positive values, meaning that the platform’s user base has been constantly accumulating the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Next Bitcoin Peak: Why It Could Still Be 2 Years Away From the graph, it’s visible that the buying on Coinbase appears to have only ramped up during the past couple of days, as the Premium Gap has observed a sharp spike. The timing of this surge could indicate that the US-based investors are the ones helping the asset’s recent growth beyond the $27,000 level. This is a good sign, naturally, as strong buying pressure from the US institutional holders could provide the appropriate fuel for the cryptocurrency to retest higher levels. It now remains to be seen whether the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap would continue to remain at positive values in the coming days, or if buying would cool down on the platform.

42376288,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6A4MJ,1695134130,A Step-by-Step Guide to Going Private,"One of the most common questions I get from people who are starting to realize the need for personal privacy is, ""Where do I start?""  To better answer that question for yourself, it can be helpful to build out a simple threat model by considering what data you want to protect, whom you want to protect it from, and how much trouble you’re willing to go through to protect it.  Seth For Privacy is a privacy educator who hosts the ""Opt Out"" podcast. He also contributes to the Monero project, an open-source and privacy preserving cryptocurrency. This article is part of CoinDesk's Privacy Week series.  While this question is not one I can answer for you, here is how I would do it if starting from scratch in my privacy journey today.  Please remember that not all threats are equal, and not all people have the same priorities – so be sure to take what is below (especially the order!) with a grain of salt and try to assess the best path for you.  1. Find a privacy-loving community  This is not a technical solution but is by far the most important step you can take. Having a group of people around you to support you, give solid feedback and bounce ideas off of is an essential aspect of a successful journey towards privacy.  A community of like-minded peers concerned about privacy can help with the psychological burdens – nihilism, loneliness, hopelessness – that can come with falling down the privacy ""rabbit hole.""  Before you go any further, this should be your first priority regardless of your own personal threat model and needs.  Techlore's Discord server, the “Opt Out” podcast and “TheNewOil” blog have all been invaluable resources. They also all have “rooms” on the social platform Matrix (here, here and here, respectively), which is a tool you should familiarize yourself with. The Bitcoin Freedom and Tech Matrix room also deserves a special plug, and is broader in scope than just the intricacies of Bitcoin.  2. Use a privacy-preserving browser  This step might appear daunting if you’re used to the conveniences of Google Chrome, for instance, but in the data economy, convenience comes with privacy trade-offs.  Thankfully there are excellent browser alternatives. As we spend more and more of our lives online, a browser that is more privacy-preserving by default or being able to “tune” (configure) a browser you already use can be a huge win in decreasing the amount of data that third parties collect about you. A few choice browsers:  Firefox is one of the most popular browsers. The ""Yet Another Firefox Hardening Guide"" will walk you through the process of tuning your browser. It's very straightforward, and only needs to be done once per computer.  Brave Browser has some excellent defaults but takes some odd approaches (like cryptocurrency ads all over the place and built-in cryptocurrency wallets which aren't helpful to most people). The Anonymousplanet.org guide shows you how to make it a bit more privacy and secure.  Ungoogled Chromium takes the best of Chrome Browser and strips Google from it, making a very compelling and very fast browser. It can be a bit tricky to get and keep updated on some operating systems, and extension installation and updates are a bit of a pain, but it's a great option for those who are hardcore but still like the Chrome web engine.  See also: Handshake Goes Live With an Uncensorable Internet Browser  There are also a series of extensions that bring privacy with the convenience of a download.  uBlock Origin is available for all of the browsers mentioned above. It goes far beyond just blocking ads, and handles a wide swath of ad, tracker and script blocking in a way that is very rarely detrimental to the browsing experience. It’s an absolute must install, no matter which browser you choose.  LocalCDN helps to improve privacy by replacing potentially dangerous pieces of websites with vetted and safe local ones, reducing network calls and the risk of compromised assets being delivered by web pages. It’s similar to Decentraleyes.  The password manager extension you download will depend on the password manager you choose in the next step, but I highly recommend installing one, where available, for simpler autofill and password management when browsing.  3. Use a password manager  While this step isn't technically privacy related, properly securing your passwords will lead to much better privacy by reducing the amount of data leaks and hacks you experience as a result of stolen or leaked credentials. Password managers make it extremely simple to manage usernames and passwords across all of the sites and apps you use without needing to reuse these credentials.  Migrating to a password manager is also a great chance to think twice about which accounts you actually need, and close those you don't.  Bitwarden is what my wife and I use. It works very well, is open-source, cross-platform and can be self-hosted if desired.  KeepassXC is a well-respected FOSS (free and open software) password manager. It does not sync across devices natively but works well and has a solid history.  4. Use a privacy-preserving email service  The process of switching email providers is a long and quite involved process, so should preferably be done after improving your browser. Having a password manager handy will help in migrating email and passwords.  Privacy-preserving email providers generally use native forms of end-to-end encryption (E2EE) whenever possible, and prevent them from reading your mail. They’re vital in reducing the data available about your communication, shopping, job hunting, etc. to invasive companies like Google and Microsoft.  ProtonMail is probably the most well-known name in the privacy-preserving email space, and for good reason. It has many solid features out of the box, a usable free tier and great cross-platform clients to go with a long history of supporting user privacy.  CTemplar: I personally prefer and use CTemplar, as I appreciate their pricing, approach to privacy, mobile app (in F-Droid) and their acceptance of Monero directly for payments.  While I haven't used Tutanota, many people I trust do. They also provide steep discounts to FOSS and non-profit organizations, so it’s well worth a look if you happen to be a part of either of those.  See also: Monero: The Privacy Coin Explained  5. Use a privacy-preserving search engine  This step can seem quite annoying at first as none of the privacy-preserving search engines are quite as fast or complete as simply using Google, but the data you provide to a search engine tells a lot about you and removing that is a key step towards reducing your digital footprint.  Each of the alternatives have some key pros and cons and are really up to personal choice. I recommend trying them each for a day or more as your default and see what solution fits you best.  DuckDuckGo uses Bing results on the back end and is one of the more polished and faster user experiences in the space. They're one of the easiest to switch to, for sure.  I host a public instance of Whoogle and really appreciate the ability to get Google search results without revealing my IP address and the extra bloat of Google searches. It's quite easy to self-host, if desired.  Searx is probably the most hard-core option, yet still provides a solid experience and search results. You can find public instances here.  6. Switch yourself and your friends/family to a more private messaging service/app  Getting the people you chat with most to switch messaging platforms is difficult. However, to get the most benefit, you’ll have to try your hardest to get them to jump ship with you. This is made all the more difficult in that there are so many options – an experience of decision paralysis often made worse by the ""messaging wars.”  Thankfully, I was able to get all of my friends and family to switch to Signal, but I know that's not always possible.  Introducing a private-by-default and E2EE messaging app into your workflow helps prevent self-censorship, surveillance and state censorship in private chats, and is an essential tool to liberty and freedom over the long run.  Signal has the brand recognition it does for a reason: It's extremely easy to use, easy to onboard new people and has a similar core feature set as most other default messaging apps. It's not perfect. But it is an incredible tool and has been a huge boon for the privacy and free speech movements.  Note that Signal does require a phone number to use. That comes with the important ability to handle SMS natively in Signal, making it an extremely capable iMessage replacement and a much easier sell in the U.S. where SMS is still quite popular for some reason. While linking a phone number can be detrimental if pseudonymity or anonymity, this does not harm or reduce the encrypted privacy provided by Signal.  See also: Signal Messaging App Launches MobileCoin  Threema takes WhatsApp’s template and orients the app around preserving user privacy, including end-to-end encrypted chats, voice messages and other features by default. It also drops Signal’s phone number requirement, which is a big win for pseudonymity.  I tend to use Signal with people I know personally, and Threema for chats with people I do not know.  7. Use a more privacy-preserving form of money  While cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are commonly considered private or anonymous, this is a misnomer. Most cryptocurrencies are not privacy preserving by default, and merely enable fragile pseudonymity at best. With this in mind, here are a couple recommendations for using cryptocurrencies while staying private.  Use Monero. Monero is a privacy-preserving cryptocurrency that shields information about senders, receivers and amounts by default. If interested, these two videos (here and here) helped me get started while “Monero Outreach” provides a feature-by-feature breakdown.  Use Samourai Wallet for Bitcoin. Samourai Wallet is by far the best way to use Bitcoin, in my opinion, and enables fairly easy-to-use and approachable privacy on Bitcoin. While privacy on Bitcoin can be extremely fragile and difficult to achieve, Samourai Wallet makes it as simple as possible, keeps fees down and has a long track record. BitcoinQnA’s in-depth guide to bitcoin mixing, EconoAlchemist’s guide to wallet use and ""Opt Out"" podcast’s breezy walkthrough are fine places to start. You might also want to check Samourai’s code.  8. Use a non-logging and trustworthy VPN provider  VPNs (virtual private networks), often get a bad rap as there are so many malicious and predatory providers out there and even more that force cheesy advertisements on YouTube videos. VPNs as a tool, however, can be invaluable.  Using a VPN that does not log user traffic is a great way to shift the trust from your network provider (home ISP, mobile carrier, etc.) to a trusted third party that doesn't have your personal information or home address.  When selecting a VPN it's extremely important that you do your own research and come to your own conclusions. You might start by asking the question, ""Do I need a VPN?"" Then ask what’s Tor, and how does it compare to a VPN? At some point, you may even ask, “what’s a second realm?"".  Here’s a handy VPN toolkit, but I will recommend two VPNs as starting points:  IVPN has a trustworthy team, incredible cross-platform clients and a strong reputation that has survived external audits. They’ve been extremely honest about the shortcomings of VPNs generally – and in the spirit of full disclosure, sponsor my podcast.  Mullvad is a VPN I have long recommended and used, is well trusted by many in the privacy community and has a long track record of caring deeply about user privacy and not logging user traffic.  9. Use a privacy-preserving mobile operating system  This section is a bit more drastic than the others, but switching to an operating system that is designed around protecting user privacy gives you a strong foundation for all of the other steps to live on top of and enhances their effect – and often makes them easier!  CalyxOS is the only real recommendation I can make. (Full disclosure: I am a financial supporter of the Calyx Institute, the nonprofit organization behind CalyxOS.)  I’ve run it for almost a year and found it to be an incredibly powerful tool. It takes the open-source Android operating system created by Google and strips the tracking scripts out of it, then builds it back up with a focus on user privacy and FOSS app stores (like F-Droid). For more on CalyxOS and my experience/recommendations, see my blog post ""Switching to CalyxOS"".  See also: What If We Get Online Privacy Right? A Glimpse of 2035  Depending on your threat model, an iPhone can also be a solid approach to gaining strong third-party privacy due to Apple’s long-standing commitment to consumer privacy. That said, you may be protected from third-party data collection on an iPhone, but not from Apple’s prying eyes.  10. Use a more privacy-conscious desktop operating system  For Linux to seem attractive, you'll likely have to be a bit deeper down the privacy and self-sovereignty rabbit hole. Things are getting better each year, but switching operating systems still requires some extra know-how and dedication.  However, the switch is well worth it. I switched entirely to running Linux on both my desktop and laptop without serious issues. I use the Pop_OS! Linux distribution (distro) on all my computers. It's based on Ubuntu and provides sane defaults, a powerful app store and consistent and stable updates.  System76, the company behind Pop_OS!, also sells their own laptops and desktops that are custom-built for their software. The best thing about Linux is it’s almost infinitely configurable.  While I haven't used ZorinOS personally, it’s ""easy to switch"" approach makes it quite attractive. I’ve heard from trusted sources it really is the easiest jump away from Windows or macOS. And, if you're willing to pay, you can get a lot of extra features, support and bundled apps.  The next step?  While the above list is certainly not the be-all and end-all of privacy, I hope it shows how straightforward a privacy-conscious journey can be. The first step is just to start thinking about why or how you might want to improve your privacy – taking an account of what you value and perhaps ditching the so-called conveniences of modern life that you pay for with your most trusted information.  It’s a deep rabbit hole – but if you ever have questions on your journey (or about this post) you can reach out via Twitter, Matrix, Threema or email.

42419596,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEzjJ,1695134112,The Truth About Crypto and Sex Work,"It’s tempting to imagine sex workers finding it easy to get rich online, with flashy headlines highlighting rare cases where a bitcoin-savvy adult performer made $1.3 million in a single year, for example.  The reality is that the average adult performer might earn just a few hundred dollars a month.  Accepting bitcoin (BTC) doesn’t guarantee anything. Content creators are still hustling to attract paying clients.  This piece is part of CoinDesk's Sin Week.  The coronavirus pandemic ushered in a new era of remote sex work, with a captive audience of consumers willing to try paying independent content creators, sometimes for the first time. And yet, as lockdowns end, sex workers who accept payments directly from customers generally report there isn’t “wider adoption” of crypto payments today than there was before the last crypto bull run.  In fact, a performer who goes by Bitcoinstripper told CoinDesk that bitcoin usage is “significantly less common” among clients than it was back in 2017, before the pandemic reshaped the industry landscape. It’s hard to convince clients to use bitcoin when gift cards and cash options have become easier to send, she said, especially when bitcoin’s reputation fluctuates. It may actually be getting harder over time, not easier, for sex workers to use cryptocurrency.  “I had to groom 99% of the clients who have [used bitcoin] with me,” she said.  Bear market blues  Likewise, adult performer Maya Kendrick, a vivacious redhead with a penchant for artistic lingerie photo shoots, told CoinDesk that many of her clients switched to paying in dollar-denominated stablecoins, like USDC. Then, when this year’s bear market reduced the price of BTC and ether (ETH), the clients reduced their patronage altogether.  “They're booking shorter dates than they were before May. I've been getting less requests from crypto clients in general and more from other professions like surgeons,” Kendrick said. “Clients new to crypto have been hesitant to pay with it now because they see it as more volatile.”  Read More: What Sex Workers Want to Do With Bitcoin  Performer Etherealzoey, a plus-size intellectual with ebony skin, has noticed the same reluctance among her clients and peers who were previously crypto-curious.  “Clients tend to be more hesitant when it comes to crypto as well as performers,” Etherealzoey told CoinDesk, noting how the industry changes during a bear market.  However, it’s important to note this shift is specific to crypto, not overall demand for sex workers’ services, which Etherealzoey calls “recession-proof.” Her content projects focused on “Black and brown, queer, fat and disabled performers” continue attracting new fans, regardless of broader market conditions.  “It's the oldest profession and one of the most consistent when it comes to supply and demand,” she added, clarifying the recession has changed, although not reduced, demand for direct interactions with performers.  During a bear market, it may be harder for performers to convince clients to pay directly, using cryptocurrency. However, consistently earning bitcoin from loyal customers continues to be a profitable strategy for some sex workers. And a bear market means that when the dollar-denominated price is low, performers can earn more bitcoin per session.  “I still get paid in bitcoin at least once a week,” said bitcoin-savvy dominatrix Mistress Nicci, a bold and assertive blonde in Colorado who runs her own BDSM dungeon. “I have been surprised to notice that business has not been affected for me. This goes for online and in person, as I am still having the same volume of bookings and video sales.”  Privacy hazards  On the other hand, Bitcoinstripper said there’s been an increase in surveillance and bans against sex workers, as exchanges and crypto companies fall in line with credit card compliance norms. She’s been using cryptocurrency since 2017 and believes that off-ramps are getting harder for sex workers to use.  “Each [market] cycle brings greater, faster, cheaper chain analysis,” Bitcoinstripper said. “More exchanges and banks refuse to do business with people who’s income comes from sex work, due either to ever encroaching regulations or company policies responding to political pressures.”  “Each cycle we need to be more careful of protecting our personal data from clients. In bear markets, in times and places of low liquidity, it becomes even harder to hide certain transactions,” she added.  Likewise, performer Allie Awesome, whose cheeky and relatable content exudes girl-next-door vibes, said that sometimes waiting to cash out until prices and volumes perk back up may not be an option for sex workers from marginalized communities.  Read More: Why This Sex Industry Executive Loves Bitcoin  “If you thought getting people to pay for their porn with crypto during a bull market was tough, boy howdy, that was nothing,” Allie said. “I’d love to know what all of the people who said bitcoin is the solution to sex workers’ banking problems are doing to support our community during the bear market.”  Low liquidity in the few exchange platforms and tools that don’t require know-your-customer banking information creates a privacy conundrum. It’s easier for sex workers to find anonymity when there’s a crowd users. Sex workers must strike a balance between experimenting with new tools and avoiding scams.  “If I were to make any recommendation regarding usability in a bear market, it would be to follow those who are building solutions to improve usability, not only in the beauty of a fast seamless two-click [user experience], but also in preserving privacy and accessibility for undocumented, marginalized or underserved populations. Because if they can make it work for those populations, it will work for most people,” Bitcoinstripper said. “We need crypto to be reliably usable in every part of the market cycle, if it is to work for us.”  UPDATE (Nov. 3 2022 – 16:00 UTC): Replaced link with primary data source.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2023/09/19/the-truth-about-crypto-and-sex-work,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/04233b9914f52c76fc7547bc9f1d74c47ef4fada-4361x3271.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42419593,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEzlN,1695133530,CZ Denies Binance.US Used Ceffu or Binance Custody in Apparent Contradiction,"Crypto tycoon Changpeng “CZ” Zhao has denied that his exchange Binance’s U.S. arm used a custody software provided by its international counterpart, in an apparent contradiction with previous statements by Binance.US in legal filings.  Binance Custody, a wallet service later rebranded Ceffu, is at the center of a probe by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which is seeking assurances that the U.S. exchange’s assets won’t be transferred overseas.  “For the record, Binance.US does not use, and have NEVER used Ceffu or Binance Custody,” CZ, who is Binance's founder and chief executive officer, said in a Tuesday post on social network X, previously Twitter, the day after the SEC and Binance.US squared off in a Washington, DC court on the issue.  That stands in stark contrast to previous statements made by lawyers for the U.S. exchange – identified as BAM in court filings –which said that Binance.US had used custody software provided by international arm Binance Holdings Ltd (BHL), a program that was later marketed as Ceffu.  BAM “relies on wallet custody software developed by BHL to maintain the digital asset wallets that hold much of its customers’ assets,” said a Sept. 12 court filing by Binance.US, which is seeking to shake off SEC charges it operated an unregistered crypto exchange, adding that when the company later “learned that BHL was planning to market the software commercially under the name ‘Ceffu,’ it adopted the name as a shorthand reference to the software, including in correspondence with the SEC.""  ""While BAM referred to the BHL software as 'Ceffu,' it never suggested that it licensed software from any entity other than BHL,"" the filing by Binance.US added. ""BAM has been clear that it relies on wallet custody software licensed from BHL in all its correspondence with the SEC and submissions to this Court.""  In a further court filing the SEC says is Binance.US' Digital Asset and Custody Operations Policy, the U.S. firm states that it licensed custody software and support services from Ceffu, which the document says was previously BHL, again appearing to contradict CZ's tweet.  Ceffu – rebranded from Binance Custody in February – last week denied that it had provided services to Binance.US, or that it operated in the country at all, but its relationship to Binance remains a gray area.  An Aug. 3 screengrab of the Ceffu website, detected and published by the SEC, suggests Ireland-based Binance Institutional Holdings Limited controls the custodian's trademarks and data and describes a Singaporean entity named Binance Institutional SG Pte as one of its operating arms. References to Binance appear to have been removed in an Aug. 8 website update.  Binance.US and CZ have not responded to requests for further clarity.

This price move represents a nearly 23% increase. Although there’s been a slight pullback, its price remains around $0.000027. In the early hours of today, XEC traded at $0.000027, with a 15% 24-hour price increase. But as of the time of writing, XEC traded at $0.000026, with a 4% decline in the last 24 hours. Nonetheless, its trading volume remains up by 311% in the last 24 hours, depicting increased network activity. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Gearing Up For A 60% Surge? Key Indicators To Watch Interestingly, the ongoing uptrend has persisted over the past seven days with an over 17% increase in its price. The bullish momentum has allowed XEC to retain most of its past month’s gain, with an 8% 30-day price increase. But what’s driving it, and how long can it last? What Is Driving XEC’s Rally And How Long Will The Rally Last? The eCash ecosystem has witnessed exciting developments that sparked massive investor interest in the past few weeks. These developments might be the driving force behind XEC’s impressive performance. One such innovation is the eCash Mainnet integration with RocketX, a crypto-swapping platform. This integration helps users easily swap several cryptocurrencies, including BTC, ETH, and Cosmos, with the XEC token, thus increasing network activity. Furthermore, on September 13, eCash developers announced that PayButton, an online vendor payment portal, now supports XEC. The upgraded PayButton, initially launched in February 2019, will make it easier for online vendors to monitor their payments. According to the developers, the goal is to increase eCash usage online. Also, they aim to achieve increased adoption by making eCash user-friendly. The upgrade has likely spiked the interest of investors, given the rise in the global relevance of e-commerce. According to Santiment data, eCash witnessed a 270% uptick in social volume in the last three days. Also, network development has increased by 120% over the past seven days. While these developments boosted XEC’s price these past few days, the ongoing rally’s longevity remains uncertain, given the market’s unpredictable nature. However, the following analysis could provide hints. Buyers Show Dominance On The Daily Chart: Will Their Charge Sustain XEC’s Rally? A close examination of the daily chart suggests the bulls are determined to facilitate more gains for XEC. Their strong market dominance is evident in the formation of the large green candle on the daily chart. While the token’s price remains below the 200-day Simple Moving Average, the upper wick of today’s candle has a charge above this price level ($0.0000277). This suggests that the bulls intend to sustain the rally for longer. Nonetheless, XEC is bullish on the short term as the buyers have sustained its price above the 50-day SMA. This observation also confirms an ongoing accumulation of the tokens, leading to the prevailing price surge. Given these technical indicators, the uptrend will continue if XEC closes above the 200-day SMA in the coming days. Moreover, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 64.2, approaching the overbought area, confirms buyers’ dominance. Related Reading: Ripple CTO Explains Company’s Stance On Debunking Outrageous XRP Price Predictions Additionally, this setup depicts an accumulation phase as more traders open new long positions ahead of further price gains. The ongoing rally will likely persist until XEC attains an overbought condition when buyers reach saturation. However, a retracement after it enters the overbought zone is still possible.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin held just above $27,000 after rising to the highest since Aug. 31 as U.S. rates traders penciled in greater odds of the Federal Reserve keeping borrowing costs unchanged later this week and through the rest of the year. The leading cryptocurrency by market value jumped to $27,220 Monday, having climbed almost 8% since the ominous-sounding death cross pattern appeared on its daily price chart a week ago. The advance since that bearish crossover of the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) below the 200-day moving average reinforces the measure's reputation as an unreliable standalone indicator. Bitcoin has retreated slightly since, trading at around $27,100. Solana’s SOL gained 3% on Tuesday and ether was up slightly at $1,643.  Bankrupt crypto exchange FTX has sued founder and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried's parents, Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried, to ""recover millions of dollars in fraudulently transferred and misappropriated funds,"" the company said in a Monday court filing. The filing, redacted in parts, asks the court to award the FTX estate damages, the return of any property given or payment made to the parents by FTX, and punitive damages resulting from ""conscious, willful, wanton, and malicious conduct."" According to the filing,""FTX Trading paid $18,914,327.82, inclusive of taxes, fees, and costs, for Blue Water, to which Bankman and Fried received title, as well as various expenses related to Blue Water totaling more than $90,000,"" as one example. The filing also alleged that ""Bankman’s command of tax law and unique understanding of the FTX Group’s muddled corporate structure allowed him to facilitate the transfer of a cash gift totaling $10 million to himself and Fried consisting of Alameda Ltd. funds.""  Alums from some well-known names in crypto and fintech are starting a new $60 million fund called Oak Grove Ventures, which focuses on the intersection of Web3, artificial intelligence and biotech. The Singapore-based team includes some notable figures including Sally Wang, formerly of Sino Global Capital (now Ryze Labs), Ethan Wang, former tech lead of Libra, Shawn Shi, co-founder of Alchemy Pay, as well as Michael Li, a former VP of Coinbase. “We understand that the journey of building groundbreaking technologies is not just about capital; it's about fostering a community of visionaries, pioneers, and founders who share our passion for innovation. With this fund, our strategy is simple yet profound: to raise funds for the founders,” Sally Wang, the fund’s head of investments, said in a statement to CoinDesk.  Chart of the Day  Chainlink's LINK token has climbed 14% over the past 7 days.  LINK climbed to $6.83 on Monday, gaining just over 10% on the day, outperforming the wider crypto market.  On-chain data from spotonchain shows that four Chainlink wallets unlocked and transferred out 18.75 million LINK (worth around $117 million) over the weekend.  Lookonchain noted that the Chainlink wallet has been depositing LINK to Binance every three months since August 2022, totalling over 71 million LINK (worth around $446 million).

Wright served legal papers on Cøbra in April 2021 over the copyright of Bitcoin's whitepaper, the popular cryptocurrency's manifesto. The Australian computer scientist who has long claimed to be its pseudonymous author Satoshi Nakamoto, accused operators of the Bitcoin.org payment network's website of infringing his rights by publishing the white paper. Wright claimed that, as Satoshi, he owned the copyright to the Bitcoin manifesto.  After Cøbra was a no-show in court, a judge ordered the white paper to be taken down from the website. Then, when Cøbra attempted to challenge Wright's request 568,516.42 pounds ($704,500) in legal fees, a London High Court Judge ruled in November that in order to challenge the costs, Cøbra had to identify themselves.  On Monday, London High Court Justice Richard Smith dismissed Cøbra's appeal on the November ruling saying that, although there are several reasons why parties would legally request anonymity, including threat to life, Cøbra's reasons for not identifying themselves seemed ""not only unworkable but also risked undermining the very principles of natural justice"" because they sought to remain anonymous ""not only against the public at large, but against the Claimant [Wright] and the court as well.""  Pseudonymous characters that are prominent community members, developers or influencers are commonplace in the crypto world, which may explain Cøbra's fight to stay anonymous. Meanwhile, Wright is pursuing multiple lawsuits around the world over the Bitcoin whitepaper, and even libel over claims that he is Satoshi.  Lawyers for Wright told CoinDesk on Monday that they are awaiting an order on next steps, including whether Cøbra is now required to pay up in full.

OneCoin Lawyer Denied Retrial According to a report by Bloomberg, a US court has denied Mark Scott’s request to be granted a new trial. The lawyer is said to have helped launder $400 million as part of the proceeds from the scheme and was found guilty by the court in November 2019 of money laundering and bank fraud conspiracy. Related Reading: Ripple CTO Explains Company’s Stance On Debunking Outrageous XRP Price Predictions However, Scott was hoping to get a new trial on the grounds of “legal mistakes” and following evidence that the prosecution witness, who happens to be the brother of the “cryptoqueen” Ruja Ignatova, perjured himself on the witness stand. As to the court’s reason for the decision, US District Judge Edgardo Ramos stated that he wasn’t convinced that Scott was innocent despite the fact that Ignatova’s brother, Konstantin Ignatov, lied in his testimony. The judge may have reached this conclusion because the prosecution provided other irrefutable evidence to the fact that Scott was guilty, and the court’s ruling paves the way for Scott to be sentenced. However, Bloomberg reports that Scott’s lawyer mentioned that his client intends to appeal the decision. According to him, it is disappointing that the court didn’t grant a new trial despite being provided with “undisputed evidence that the Government’s sole cooperating witness perjured himself.” Ignatov had himself been prosecuted for his role in his sister’s fraudulent scheme. However, he pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with the prosecutor, including testifying against other alleged conspirators like Scott. One Of The Largest Fraud Schemes On September 12, US District Judge Edgardo Ramos sentenced OneCoin’s co-founder Karl Greenwood to 20 years imprisonment and ordered him to pay close to $300 Million in forfeiture. In the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) statement, Greenwood, alongside Ruja Ignatova, is said to have “operated one of the largest fraud schemes ever perpetrated.” Karlwood and Ignatova reportedly made over $4 billion from their fraudulent scheme, with many investors worldwide investing their money in the cryptocurrency OneCoin. At the time, Ignotova claimed that crypto would be the “Bitcoin killer.” Related Reading: Incoming Milestone Could Be Very Bullish For XRP Price, Here’s Why The “Cryptoqueen” still remains at large and is listed on the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) top 10 most-wanted fugitives.

The wide-ranging report was spurned at least in part by British broadcaster Nigel Farage's accusations that his bank account was shuttered because of his political views, leading to wider concerns about discriminatory debanking.  The U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority says it facilitated discussions between banks and crypto firms that have been struggling to access banking services in a controversial Tuesday report addressing reasons for debanking in the country.  The report, which follows allegations from broadcaster and former politician Nigel Farage that his bank account was shuttered over his political views, said ""the most common reported reasons for personal and business account applications being declined, suspended or terminated were financial crime suspicions identified, due diligence concerns, and inactive/dormant accounts.""  Some crypto firms have been struggling to open a bank account in the U.K. and companies like NatWest have said they won't open bank accounts for crypto firms.  The FCA report, which compiled data from 34 credit institutions and payment firms, said that crypto was among the industries that some payment account providers did not give banking access to. Although it has ""limited time"" to dedicate to businesses obtaining bank accounts, the FCA said it has taken steps where it can to influence decisions to ensure market integrity.  Dialogue between crypto firms and banks ""can help ensure a fair and balanced approach is taken, clarify approaches and the reasons behind decisions taken, and explore appropriate ways of mitigating concerns and potential risks,"" the report said.  Multiple media outlets reported Monday that the FCA report was going to say it found no evidence that banks closed accounts over customers' political stances, with Farage calling the report ""total nonsense.""  ""Given the limitations of the data, we have not been able to draw detailed conclusions on the types of personal or business customers affected by suspensions, terminations and declines,"" the report said, adding that the cases flagged where the ""expression of political or any other opinion"" may have been a factor in account closure didn't pan out and were instead mostly due to customer behavior including racism.

Traders and investors should brace themselves for potential price volatility. Arbitrum (ARB) is currently trading at $0.8485. Chart: TradingView.com Meanwhile, Layer-2 solutions have emerged as the dominant force in the cryptocurrency sector, witnessing extraordinary growth from $5 billion to $10 billion in just nine months. Arbitrum, along with Base, reportedly deserves much of the credit for this remarkable expansion. In a race for supremacy, Arbitrum overtook Optimism to become the world’s largest Layer-2 blockchain, with an impressive $5.3 billion in assets locked on its platform. Currently, Arbitrum controls over half of the funds locked in the Layer-2 market, while Optimism claims another 25.4% of the market share. Key Moment For Crypto The forthcoming ARB token unlock next year promises to be a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency market. While it may initially introduce uncertainty and bearish sentiments, historical data suggests that ARB has the potential to rebound strongly in the weeks following the unlock.

As described in our last in-depth price analysis of SHIB, two chart patterns on the 1-week chart could continue to determine the future of SHIB price, and their outlooks could not be more different. We are talking about a bullish triple bottom that points to a possible end of SHIB’s two-year downtrend and a descending triangle that has been formed for over 13 months, indicating a bearish trend. Shiba Inu Price Analysis: Update At the moment, the bulls seem to have the upper hand. SHIB was trading at $0.00000741 at press time and managed a weekly close above the crucial support line of $0.00000715 on Sunday evening. With this, SHIB may have fended off the bears’ attack for now and is targeting a rise towards the descending triangle resistance line. The possibility of a validation of the triple bottom, a bullish chart pattern, thus remains. The chart pattern is characterized by three lows at roughly the same level, bouncing off a support level and culminating in a breakout above resistance. Related Reading: These Countries Are Picking Shiba Inu Over Dogecoin And Cardano However, the bulls remain vulnerable. If the SHIB price falls below the $0.00000715 support level, it could confirm the descending triangle and potentially push SHIB towards its year-to-date low of $0.000006. A break of this level could plunge SHIB into uncharted waters and make a new all-time low a grim possibility. On the way up, key resistances include $0.00000880 (23.6% Fibonacci), the descending triangle trendline at around $0.0000095 and $0.00001, $0.00001053 (38.6% Fibonacci), $0.00001193 (50% Fibonacci), and $0.00001332 (61.8% Fibonacci). As then, the August 2022 high at $0.00001784 could be extremely important resistance. 4-Hour Chart: SHIB/USD In the shorter timeframes, such as the 4-hour chart, we can see that the bulls cannot yet feel secure (yet). SHIB is currently stuck in the trading range between $0.00000688 (78.6% Fibonacci) and $0.00000797 (61.8% Fibonacci). After briefly falling into oversold territory (below 30) on September 11, the RSI has now risen to 42. However, this metric also shows that sentiment remains subdued.

Then, resistance at the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level ($0.00000797) would come into focus. The crossing of this resistance can be seen as a bullish confirmation in the shorter time frames. Next price targets would then be the 50% Fibonacci retracement at $0.00000873, the 200-day EMA at $0.00000897, the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement at $0.00000949, and the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement at $0.00001043 before the yearly high at $0.00001596 would be within reach. A rise to this price level would mean a 60% rally for Shiba Inu buyers at the current price.

17832998,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=551980,1695124680,Tricks of the trade: how to get the most out of the PrimeXBT Trading Academy,"The Cryptocurrency market moves fast, and without the right knowledge, it can be difficult to capitalise on opportunities or avoid major losses. That’s where the PrimeXBT Trading Academy comes in. As a comprehensive educational resource for Crypto traders of all levels, the PrimeXBT Trading Academy offers the insights you need to make smarter trades. In this article, we’ll explore some key tricks of the trade to help you get the most out of the PrimeXBT Trading Academy. Whether you’re just starting out or looking to take your skills to the next level, these tips will ensure you extract maximum value from all the academy has to offer. What is PrimeXBT? But first, what exactly is PrimeXBT? PrimeXBT was founded in 2018 and offers clients access to an award-winning multi-asset trading platform. It allows users to trade not only Crypto Futures on assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, but also offers margin trading on Forex, Commodities, and Stock Indices – all from one account. The company is known for offering advanced trading tools, robust security features, excellent liquidity, and competitive fees. PrimeXBT also hosts the exclusive Covesting module, a peer-to-peer Copy Trading platform that connects less experienced followers with successful professional traders. Now onto the tricks of maximising your learning from the PrimeXBT Trading Academy. Master the essentials The foundation for all successful Crypto trading is having a solid grasp of the essential concepts and terminology. The PrimeXBT Trading Academy has an entire section dedicated to Crypto essentials. Spend time ensuring you understand key ideas like what Cryptocurrencies are, what ledgers and blockchains are, the difference between centralised and decentralised networks, what wallets are, and important vocabulary like HODL, FUD, FOMO, and more. Without fluency in Crypto basics, it’s easy to get overwhelmed by more advanced material. So take it step-by-step, mastering Crypto essentials before moving to more complex topics. Learn multiple trading strategies One of the biggest mistakes new traders make is trying to master just one trading strategy or style, like day trading or swing trading. The reality is, to consistently profit in Crypto, you need versatility to adapt to ever-shifting market conditions. The PrimeXBT Trading Academy provides education on multiple approaches, including long-term investing, day trading, swing trading, scalping, dollar-cost averaging, and more. Study the pros and cons of each, and develop skills across multiple strategies. This expands your ability to generate returns regardless of whether markets are steady, volatile, bullish, or bearish. Practise good risk management Perhaps the most important element of trading success is effective risk management. Skilled risk management is what separates profitable traders from gamblers who are soon wiped out. The PrimeXBT Trading Academy offers many tips and tactics for minimising risk, such as using stop loss and take profit orders, maintaining proper position sizing, diversifying, and more. But knowledge alone isn’t enough – you must repeatedly practise implementing good risk management until it becomes second nature. Don’t skip risk management lessons even if other topics seem more exciting. Making risk management an ingrained habit is essential for long-term trading success. Keep an organised trading journal A trading journal is one of the most powerful (and underutilised) learning tools. Recording details of each trade, analysing wins and losses, and tracking key performance metrics over time provides data-driven insights into strengthening your approach. The PrimeXBT Trading Academy emphasises the importance of keeping a detailed trading journal. So be sure to put this advice into action. Over time, the patterns and trends in your trading journal will reveal both strengths to leverage and weaknesses to address. Learn technical analysis Understanding technical analysis is what enables traders to forecast price movements, identify emerging trends, and pinpoint optimal entry and exit points. The Trading Academy offers extensive technical analysis education, covering chart types, indicators, support and resistance, triangle and wedge patterns, and more. But technical analysis is a skill requiring lots of practice, so don’t just read about it – actually learn how to plot charts and indicators yourself. The PrimeXBT platform even provides charting tools from TradingView connected to real price data so you can hone your TA abilities with hands-on experience. Turn insights into action With so much material to cover, the PrimeXBT Trading Academy offers tons of powerful insights. But simply reading the content isn’t enough – you must apply what you learn in the real world. After studying a concept, put it into practice right away rather than postponing it. Actively practising trading skills accelerates the learning curve. So frequently take the knowledge you gain and test it out yourself. Day trade a volatile Crypto, try your hand at technical analysis, implement a new risk management tactic, or whatever else you’ve learned. Turning insights into hands-on experience is key for progress. Stay disciplined and consistent Lastly, understand that mastering trading takes discipline and consistency over the long-term. Don’t expect to become an expert overnight. But stick with it, make trading education a regular habit, and regularly assess both strengths and weak spots. Maintaining this mindset is crucial for learning and development. The PrimeXBT Trading Academy is packed with invaluable lessons for traders at every level. Applying these 6 proven tricks of the trade will help you get the most out of the platform’s educational offerings. Keep studying, practising, tracking data, and implementing new skills to accelerate your trading expertise.

42419580,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEzWv,1695121200,The SBF Trial: How Did We Get Here?,"Sam Bankman-Fried stands accused of committing wire fraud and conspiracy to commit several other types of frauds. His once-mighty crypto exchange, FTX, collapsed in dramatic fashion nearly a year ago, shedding billions in value. And in two weeks, he’ll begin his effort to convince a jury of his peers that he didn’t commit any of many alleged crimes while running the company.  You're reading The SBF Trial, a CoinDesk newsletter bringing you daily insights from inside the courtroom where Sam Bankman-Fried will try to stay out of prison. Want to receive it directly? Sign up here.  If convicted of even one of the charges, Bankman-Fried faces years in a federal prison. If convicted of all of the charges, he could well spend decades, if not the rest of his life, behind bars.  But there are some nuances here. The maximum prison sentences are just guidelines. And like any criminal defendant, Bankman-Fried is innocent until proven guilty (even if the evidence made public so far seems damning). This discussion itself may be premature given his trial hasn’t even begun yet.  So how did we get here?  Samuel Bankman-Fried, 31, was arrested last December, a few short weeks after his empire filed for bankruptcy and ejected the Stanford and Jane Street alum who helmed it.  Federal prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York filed an initial indictment bringing eight charges, including wire fraud and conspiring to commit securities fraud, commodities fraud and launder money.  They later filed a set of superseding indictments, which the defense team – led by famed attorneys Mark Cohen and Christian Everdell – successfully argued can’t be brought at this time due to international extradition treaty obligations. A second trial is tentatively scheduled for next year to address these charges.  Over the estimated six-week trial, prosecutors will place members of the FTX inner circle – including former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison, former FTX Chief Technology Officer and co-founder Gary Wang and former FTX engineering director Nishad Singh – on the stand to testify against their former colleague, boss and roommate. They'll present information from FTX’s systems and balance sheets and share audio recordings over the course of the trial, all while the defense tries to poke holes in the case.  In the lead-up, these teams of attorneys will try to find 10 or 12 jurors – out of a selection of hundreds – most sympathetic to their case.  Once Sam Bankman-Fried’s criminal trial begins – putting these months of paperwork docket fights behind us – his fate will hinge on his jury’s opinion. Is the former FTX CEO a crypto criminal, or perhaps merely a victim of circumstance? They’ll have to decide based on the facts of the case. But their ranks haven’t been filled quite yet. Right now, the lawyers are debating how to determine who can make that decision.  The process of jury selection – voir dire, or “to speak the truth” – heated up late last week after government lawyers blasted the defense team’s proposed questions. A good number of them could influence potential jurors, they argued in a letter to Judge Lewis Kaplan. Some were too prying, others too specific, the feds said. A handful “are a thinly veiled attempt to advance a defense narrative,” the government claimed. Many of the questions they took umbrage with shared a common theme. They were about appearances.  Sam Bankman-Fried is (or was?) a master of appearances. From the first time this author spotted the sneakers and shorts-wearing, wild-haired billionaire on a yacht in Miami (circa June 2021) to his final television interviews preceding his arrest, the crypto wunderkind cultivated perceptions. He shuffled between personas that bolstered this image of approachable greatness. Sam was the guy you could trust to get it right even though he couldn’t tie his dress shoes.  “I think it’s important for people to think I look crazy,” the government quoted Sam as saying. His “crazy” (playing video games during interviews, dressing like a dorm room schlub, sleeping on a beanbag chair and, oh yeah, those disheveled curls) made his greatness (speaking on Capitol Hill, pioneering massive philanthropic endeavors and, oh yeah, the crypto exchange FTX) all the greater.  But the government doesn’t want to let the defense highlight any of that before the trial begins. They’re calling on Judge Kaplan to reject jury questions that probe the righteousness of philanthropic philosophies and campaign finance. Sam’s ADHD should be left off the table, they say. And don’t even think about interrogating jurors’ FTX-specific opinions.  Real or engineered, Sam’s game of perceptions has ended. He’ll begin the trial as a well-dressed defendant just like any other. The government doesn't want his old image to dictate who might eventually put him in a khaki jumpsuit.

Ripple CTO Says It’s Hard An X (formerly Twitter) user drew the attention of the Ripple CTO toward the numerous XRP price predictions that have been making the rounds on social media. The X user who goes by Darkhorse called out Ripple and its founders for not debunking these outrageous price predictions that have gone as high as $50,000, saying that “Ripple have let people suffer, while Ripple founders hit the rich list & post $2m porches.” Related Reading: Incoming Milestone Could Be Very Bullish For XRP Price, Here’s Why To round off the post, Darkhorse explained that they could’ve easily debunked these XRP price predictions to prevent this. “Would of taken 1 post to correct the BS just 1,” the user said. Schwartz who was mentioned in the tweet responded to Darkhorse’s complaints to explain why the crypto firm has not necessarily come forward to debunk the XRP price predictions. He starts out by saying that while he understands how the user felt, “it’s a lot harder than you think.” The Ripple CTO explains that debunking everything could open up a chance that the company ends up debunking something that actually turns out to be true. He further added; “If we call out everything we know is false, we’ll be seen to be enforcing things we don’t know aren’t fake because we won’t can them out.” Lastly, the CTO points to the possibility of legal risks arising from trying to debunk all of the price predictions. I completely understand why you feel this way, I do sometimes too. But it’s a lot harder than you think. We don’t know everything, and even a small chance we “debunk” something true is worrisome. If we call out everything we know is false, we’ll be seen to be enforcing things we… — David “JoelKatz” Schwartz (@JoelKatz) September 17, 2023 XRP Price Predictions Are Still Rampant The XRP price predictions are still coming in hot over the last few weeks. Some of the most notable ones include the $10,000 forecast put forward by an analyst who goes by Lord XRP on X (formerly Twitter). The prediction follows one from a Wells Fargo Manager placing the XRP price at $500. Related Reading: Coinbase’s BASE Shows Teeth As TVL Nears Solana Both of these price predictions actually follow the expectation that Ripple will begin to capture a larger share of the payments market. When this happens, the analysts expect the XRP price to rise exponentially as a result of the share of the market cap commanded by Ripple. Smaller price predictions have also included a predicted run to $130 by pseudonymous crypto analyst XRP Captain. However, the appearance of a death cross in the price trend over the last few days suggests none of these predictions would be happening anytime soon.

The exchange rolled out the liquid staking token in April following the Ethereum blockchain's transition to a proof-of-stake network. TVL fluctuated between $120 million and $170 million until a Sept. 1 influx of $165 million in two transactions and a single transaction of $243 million two weeks later. Aside from these two transactions inflows haven't exceeded $500,000 on a single day.  Liquid staking tokens are derivative tokens obtained by staking ether (ETH) on services like Lido, Coinbase or Binance and receiving the derivatives in exchange. Stakers can earn a yield while retaining an asset that can be used elsewhere across the decentralized finance (DeFi) market.  Etherscan data shows that the four largest holders of BETH are all Binance-controlled wallets, which may be Binance mirroring its users' transactions on-chain.  Whilst BETH remains relatively small in terms of TVL compared with the likes of Lido staked ether, with $14 billion, and Coinbase's $2 billion, the irregular inflows suggest that one entity or trader is putting its faith in Binance despite the regulatory uncertainty surrounding the crypto exchange.  Lido currently offers a 3.6% APY on staked ether, significantly more than BETH's 3.25%. The incentive to stake on Binance as opposed to a decentralized offering like Lido remains unclear.

42419590,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEzhF,1695110400,"UK Crime Bill Lets Cops Freeze Crypto Faster, Channels Tainted Assets to Public Funding","A new U.K. bill is set to give local authorities powers to freeze and confiscate crypto assets tied to crime if approved later this year.  Policy watchers say the bill could help prevent tainted assets from being moved before seizures in criminal cases, and possibly even contribute millions to public funding.  The U.K. is making it easier for cops to chase down crypto linked to crime with a new bill set to be finalized later this year – which policy watchers say could mean faster asset freezes and even some hefty contributions to the country’s public purse.  The Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Bill, set to be enacted later this year, would give local courts and law enforcement agencies new powers to help freeze crypto they believe was used to launder money, traffic drugs, commit cybercrime and terrorism.  Although local authorities have already seized hundreds of millions worth of crypto linked to crime, the bill could help block the movement of targeted assets faster by scrapping some legal hurdles – including requiring an arrest or conviction before cops can seize tainted crypto in criminal cases.  In time-sensitive criminal investigations, a quick freeze order could be a game-changer.  “This new bill enabling law enforcement to recover crypto assets in this way will be a powerful tool, and it is anticipated we will see a substantial increase in digital assets being recovered,” Louise Abbott, partner at Keystone Law told CoinDesk in a statement.  What’s in the bill  Provisions in the bill allow crypto linked to criminal activities to be seized and recovered under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002.  Right now, tainted crypto assets cannot be seized in criminal proceedings unless there is an arrest or conviction, which experts say could allow criminals to move targeted assets before cops can get court approval to freeze them. The new crime bill removes the arrest requirement and lets courts order the confiscation of assets before an arrest is made. Though assets can be frozen to prevent movement, they still can’t technically be seized from suspects until an arrest or conviction has been made.  The change is a plus, according to Phil Ariss, director of U.K. public sector relations at TRM Labs.  ""One area this will be used is on occasions where assets have been identified, significant links to criminality can be proven, but the subject of the investigation is unlikely to face justice in the U.K. – think of those committing fraud outside of the U.K. and targeting U.K. residents,"" said Ariss, who was crypto lead at the U.K. National Police Chiefs' Council cybercrime unit and is on sabbatical from the U.K. police force.  New civil forfeiture powers under the bill also let crypto linked to crime be seized irrespective of whether a person is convicted of criminal offenses in ongoing investigations or proceedings. Funds can be seized pursuant to court proceedings, the bill said.  “The creation of a crypto asset specific civil forfeiture power will mitigate the risk posed by those that cannot be prosecuted but use their funds to further criminality or for terrorist purposes,” a government factsheet said.  Time is of the essence  Not having to wait for an arrest to freeze crypto can cut delays in enforcement work and prevent funds from being moved – something that can be done quickly in the case of crypto.  “Time is of the essence,” Ariss said. “I'm sure there have been instances worldwide where delays have caused law enforcement to lose the assets because the subject, a third party, has moved the assets.”  U.K. cops have already seized millions of pounds worth of crypto. The New Scientist reported in 2022 that police officers had seized more than £300 million ($371 million) in crypto tied to illegal activity. Around £180 million ($223 million) in cryptocurrency was seized in 2021 by London’s Metropolitan Police.  But the new powers under the bill could improve those numbers, said Isabella Chase, senior policy adviser at TRM Labs.  Chasing millions  Data from the National Crime Agency estimated illicit crypto transactions linked to the U.K. at around £1.24 billion ($1.53 billion) in 2021.  “So, you know, that's a decent amount that we can go after,” said Isabella Chase, senior policy adviser at blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs.  It’s likely that much of the crypto seized and successfully recovered by law enforcement will help fund crime fighting, according to Chase.  “It would go either to the law enforcement agency that seized the assets or to fund economic crime work. And then half of it goes to the Home Office again solely to fight economic crime work which is really important,” Chase said.  Fighting crime is expensive, and U.K. cops have previously asked for more funding to help tackle crypto-related crime. The U.K. plans to contribute some £100 million ($124 million) to fight economic crime as part of a three-year plan, which is nearly 50% more than what was spent in 2020 – but won’t be enough, according to Chase.  “That still won't be enough to pay for all the data capability and the law enforcement capability that the U.K. needs to have a really robust system to fight financial crime,” said Chase, adding that the new seizure powers “could be really positive” in helping go after more millions in crime proceeds.  However, if the U.K. gets better at seizing crypto “they might find that the pool of available targets quickly dwindles as suspected criminals move their assets offshore to less enthusiastically policed jurisdictions,” Nick Barnard, partner at law firm Corker Binning said.

17826094,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=551881,1695109820,Is The Bitcoin Price Rally Sustainable? On-Chain Data Provides Crucial Insights,"Bitcoin has been trending up since hitting a local low below $25,000 on September 11th. Yesterday’s rally to $27,435 marked a 10% increase from the recent low. As NewsBTC reported, the rally was largely led by the futures market and a massive increase in open interest of over $1 billion, more than half of which was flushed out when BTC fell back below $27,000. Despite this, BTC is up around 7.5% from last week’s low. A reason to be bullish? Glassnode Report Sheds Light On Market Sentiment According to Glassnode, the Realized HODL Ratio (RHODL) serves as a crucial market sentiment indicator. It measures the balance between investments in recently moved coins (those held for less than a week) and those in the hands of longer-term HODLers (held for 1-2 years). The RHODL Ratio for the year 2023 is flirting with the 2-year median level. While this indicates a modest influx of new investors, the momentum behind this shift remains relatively weak. Glassnode’s Accumulation Trend Score further elaborates on this trend. It shows that the current recovery rally of 2023 has been significantly influenced by investor FOMO (Fear of Missing Out), with noticeable accumulation patterns around local price tops exceeding $30,000. This behavior contrasts sharply with the latter half of 2022, where newer market entrants showed resilience by accumulating Bitcoin at lower price levels. The Realized Profit and Loss indicators also reveal a complex picture. These metrics measure the value change of spent coins by comparing the acquisition price with the disposal price. In 2023, periods of intense coin accumulation were often accompanied by elevated levels of profit-taking. This pattern, which Glassnode describes as a “confluence,” is similar to market behavior seen in peak periods of 2021. Related Reading: End Of The Road? Why A Bitcoin Price Surge to $28,500 Could Lead To A Crash An assessment of Short-Term Holders (STH) uncovers a precarious situation. A staggering majority, more than 97.5% of the supply procured by these newcomers, is currently operating at a loss, levels unseen since the infamous FTX debacle. Using the STH-MVRV and STH-SOPR metrics, which quantify the magnitude of unrealized and realized profits or losses, Glassnode elucidates the extreme financial pressures recent investors have grappled with. Market Confidence Remains Low The report also delves into the realm of market confidence. A close examination of the divergence between the cost basis of two investor subgroups — spenders and holders — offers an indication of prevailing market sentiment. As the market reeled from the price plummet from $29k to $26k in mid-August, an overwhelmingly negative sentiment was evident. This was manifested as the cost basis of spenders fell sharply below that of holders, a clear signal of prevalent market panic. Related Reading: Why Is Bitcoin Price Up Today? BTC Climbs Above $27,000 To offer a clearer visualization, Glassnode has normalized this metric in relation to the spot price. A crucial observation is the cyclical nature of negative sentiment during bear market recovery phases, usually lasting between 1.5 to 3.5 months. The market recently plunged into its first negative sentiment phase since 2022’s conclusion. Currently, the trend lasts 20 days, which could mean that the end has not yet been marked by the recent rally, if history repeats itself. However, if there is a sustained bounce back into positive territory, it could be indicative of renewed capital inflow, signifying a return to a more favorable stance for Bitcoin holders. In conclusion, Glassnode’s on-chain data reveals a Bitcoin market that is currently in a state of flux. Although 2023 has seen new capital entering the market, the influx lacks strong momentum. Market sentiment, especially among short-term holders, is decidedly bearish. These findings indicate that caution remains the watchword, with underlying market sentiment offering mixed signals about the sustainability of the current Bitcoin rally. At press time, BTC traded at $26,846 after being rejected at the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level (at $27,369) in the 4-hour chart.

Wall Street Veteran’s Top Altcoin Pick Emerges,"Solana (SOL) has captured the attention of former Goldman Sachs executive Raoul Pal, who recently declared it one of his standout altcoin choices and a potential contender to Ethereum’s dominance. In a new interview, Pal highlighted Solana’s unique strengths, emphasizing its unrivaled speed and performance, qualities that have even prompted payments giant Visa to choose it as their platform of choice. Pal unveiled his enthusiasm for SOL, dubbing it one of his foremost altcoin choices and a contender for the most promising project outside of Ethereum. The crypto luminary also shed light on the growing influence of Solana’s co-founder, Anatoly Yakovenko, popularly known as Toly, in the cryptocurrency landscape. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Outlook: Could We See A 10% Dip Due To Supply Pressure? Pal’s bullish stance on Solana stems from its speed and exceptional performance, characteristics that have garnered attention even from giants like Visa. Pal said: “So, why is Visa using Solana? Because it’s fast. It’s fast, and it does a good job.” This sentiment represents the distinctiveness of Solana in comparison to Ethereum and hints at the potential for interconnectivity between these blockchain ecosystems. Visa’s recent announcement of its foray into stablecoin settlement capabilities on Solana further bolsters its credibility in the industry. Solana: Recent Market Performance And Outlook Despite Pal’s optimistic outlook, the charts tell a different story for Solana. On August 5th, SOL experienced a bearish market structure as its price plummeted below the crucial $22.73 support level. Subsequently, in mid-August, the cryptocurrency endured a sharp decline, witnessing a staggering 23.8% drop from its recent peak. SOL market cap currently at $8 billion on the daily chart: TradingView.com Prevailing Bearish Momentum As of now, Solana remains in the grip of this downtrend, with its market structure yet to show signs of a reversal. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) lingers below the critical 50-point mark, underscoring the prevailing bearish momentum. A pivotal line of defense for the bulls is the 78.6% retracement level at $16.94. According to analysts, a test of this support level could offer a viable buying opportunity, potentially targeting local highs at $25.5, $29, and an ambitious $32. However, a dip below the $15.5-mark would invalidate any hopes of a bullish reversal at the 78.6% retracement level. Related Reading: Solana Seeing Dark Clouds?

Accusations include diverting $10 million and exploiting FTX's corporate structure for personal gain.  Sam Bankman-Fried, currently awaiting trial, had attempted to sell FTX to Binance before filing for Chapter 11.  Bankrupt crypto exchange FTX has sued founder and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried’s parents, Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried, to “recover millions of dollars in fraudulently transferred and misappropriated funds,” the company said in a Monday court filing.  The filing, redacted in parts, asks the court to award the FTX estate damages, the return of any property given or payment made to the parents by FTX in the past, and punitive damages resulting from “conscious, willful, wanton, and malicious conduct.”  “FTX Trading paid $18,914,327.82, inclusive of taxes, fees, and costs, for Blue Water, to which Bankman and Fried received title, as well as various expenses related to Blue Water totaling more than $90,000,” the filing said, as one example. The filing also alleged that “Bankman’s command of tax law and unique understanding of the FTX Group’s muddled corporate structure allowed him to facilitate the transfer of a cash gift totaling $10 million to himself and Fried consisting of Alameda Ltd. funds.”  Read more: Sam Bankman-Fried’s Dad Thought His Son Wasn’t Paying Him Enough, So He Got Mom Involved  “Bankman and Fried deployed their decades of experience as sophisticated law professors and veneer of legitimacy not to help the FTX Group, but rather to plunder it in order to enrich themselves and their pet causes,” the filing alleged.  Bankman and Fried deployed their decades of experience as sophisticated law professors and veneer of legitimacy not to help the FTX Group, but rather to plunder it in order to enrich themselves and their pet causes  “[Bankman] thus knew, or should have known, the perilous financial state of the FTX Group, even as he moonlighted as an actor in a Super Bowl commercial and extracted millions of dollars from the FTX Group,” the filing said.  Both Bankman and Fried are professors at Stanford Law School. The complaint further alleges that Bankman helped other FTX insiders dissipate FTX group funds on donations and helped cover up a whistleblower complaint from September 2019.  ""This is a dangerous attempt to intimidate Joe and Barbara and undermine the jury process just days before their child's trial begins,"" attorneys for the parents said in a joint statement to CoinDesk. ""These claims are completely false. [John J. Ray III, FTX’s bankruptcy-era CEO] and his massive team of lawyers, who are collectively running up countless millions of dollars in fees while returning relatively little to FTX clients, know better.""  The filing said Barbara Fried was the “point person” for SBF’s political contribution strategy. Additionally, she used her “access and influence to benefit MTG [Mind the Gap], an independent expenditure-only political action committee that she co-founded in 2018 and for which she served as President and Chair.”  The filing alleges “tens of millions of dollars” were contributed to MTG or MTG-supported causes at Barbara Fried’s explicit request.  The total amount Bankman and Fried may have misappropriated was not included in the filing, though it provided certain line items. FTX alleged that either or both of them may have expensed $1,200-per-night hotel stays, plane tickets and salaries. Bankman received an annual salary of $200,000 for his role as a senior adviser to the FTX foundation, more than $18 million for the property in the Bahamas and $5.5 million in FTX Group donations to Stanford University.  Additionally, the filing alleges that Bankman was part of the small group that attempted a last-ditch effort to sell FTX to Binance.  “Bankman was included in the small group that received the Binance Letter of Intent and a calendar invitation for a meeting with Binance scheduled for November 9, 2022. On November 10, 2022, the day before the Chapter 11 filing, Bankman was scheduled to meet with The Bahamas Prime Minister,” the filing said.

17817283,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=551862,1695088830,Crypto VC Firm Blockchain Capital Secures $580M For Expansion Of Investment Funds,"Blockchain Capital, a venture capital company founded by Bart Stephens and Brad Stephens in 2013, has successfully closed two new funds, raising a total of $580 million. The firm’s general partner, Spencer Bogart, confirmed the news to TechCrunch, stating that the funds consist of a sixth early-stage fund and the firm’s first “opportunity fund.” Approximately two-thirds of the $580 million will be allocated to the early-stage fund, while the remaining one-third will be dedicated to the opportunity fund. Related Reading: End Of The Road? Why A Bitcoin Price Surge to $28,500 Could Lead To A Crash Blockchain Capital Raise For Two New Crypto Funds Per the report, the sixth early-stage fund, valued at $380 million, will primarily focus on investing in newer companies and protocols during pre-seed and Series A funding rounds. On this matter, Spencer Bogart claimed: It’s doing more of what we’ve been doing for the past decade. This is our bread and butter, and we wanted to stay aligned with LPs [and] think about prior fund sizes, but still grow a bit. On the other hand, the $200 million opportunity fund will target late-stage investments starting from Series B and onward. This strategic allocation reflects the firm’s intention to continue supporting early-stage projects while also capitalizing on promising opportunities in the later stages of development. The funds will be deployed across six sectors, namely decentralized finance, centralized finance, centralized infrastructure, decentralized infrastructure, gaming, and consumer/social. According to TechCrunch, by concentrating on these sectors, Blockchain Capital aims to remain at the “forefront” of innovation within the blockchain ecosystem. Blockchain Capital’s investor base consists of two categories: strategic limited partners (LPs) such as Visa and PayPal, and long-term committed capital from entities like university endowments, family offices, and sovereign wealth funds. Bogart further stated: The strategic partners like Visa and PayPal are more limited because it’s more active. It’s not just an LP investment; they don’t care about returns as much, but want us to be the eyes and ears on the ground for who else they should work with. Per the report, the opportunity fund will be utilized to invest in projects that the firm may have missed during its early funding rounds. This allows Blockchain Capital to participate in the growth and development of these projects, even if it had not been involved from the outset. Bogart emphasized that Blockchain Capital now takes a leading role in “most” of the funding rounds it participates in, committing over 50% of the funding while also influencing pricing, writing the term sheet, and securing board seats.

Looking ahead, Blockchain Capital intends to continue investing in blockchain-based startups with a long-term vision, staying true to its core focus over the past decade. The firm remains committed to its niche within the blockchain industry and has no plans to diversify into other sectors or investment strategies.

17814000,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=551682,1695081657,Next Bitcoin Peak: Why It Could Still Be 2 Years Away,"Bitcoin’s last all-time high was $69,000 in November 2021; as of September 2023, it’s been 22 months since that peak. While estimating what price Bitcoin could reach next can be very useful, it’s also important to estimate when a new peak could occur. History suggests this may still be some time away, as analysis shows that the next Bitcoin peak could arise around the end of 2025. Previous Cycles A specific pattern seems to occur when looking at previous tops and bottoms. The three previous bottoms, January 2015, December 2018, and November 2022, were all exactly 47 months apart. Similarly, the previous three tops, November 2013, December 2017, and November 2021, are either 49 or 47 months apart. Market participants could anticipate the next Bitcoin peak around October-December 2025 if this pattern persists. The subsequent bottom could then occur around October 2026. Source BTCUSD on TradingView.com This phenomenon of tops and bottoms forming cyclically is a widely held belief in investing. Both stock markets and economies are believed to experience periods of expansion, marked by increased economic activity and rising stock market prices, and contraction, during which the stock market prices decline, and economic growth slows. What’s particularly interesting about Bitcoin is its consistent pattern of forming its tops and bottoms roughly every four years. The ‘halving theory’ is a popular explanation for this observed pattern. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Forming A Double Bottom? Here’s What Needs To Happen The Halving Theory Approximately every four years, Bitcoin undergoes a ‘halving’ event, during which the reward for mining new blocks (i.e. the new supply of Bitcoin) is halved. This mechanism ensures the scarcity of Bitcoin, which is capped at a maximum supply of 21 million coins. A simple economic principle suggests that prices rise when supply drops while demand stays constant or grows. Historically, Bitcoin has reached a new peak a year after each halving. Given that the next halving is projected to be in April 2024, it aligns with the chart above, showing the next Bitcoin peak to be around the end of 2025.

While historical data points provide valuable insights into the potential future performance of an asset, it’s crucial to understand that history does not always exactly repeat itself – it often rhymes. This suggests that while certain patterns from the past might re-emerge, they don’t necessarily play out in the same way. Various factors, such as technological advances, macroeconomic conditions, and regulatory changes, can introduce differences. In the current market scenario, Bitcoin is navigating through a high-inflation and high-interest-rate environment for the first time. These conditions can lower market liquidity as investors might have reduced capital available for investment. Additionally, faced with such an environment, many investors could turn to savings or bonds, which may present more attractive and stable returns than other assets.
