42384932,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAm9n3,1602882532,Filecoin Settles Near $40 After Wild Opening Day of Trading,"Filecoin (FIL) speculators endured a wild opening day of trading as the highly anticipated token soared and dived across all markets, finally settling around $40 Friday evening.    Trading started at 18:25 UTC Thursday for most markets; within the first four hours, filecoins and filecoin futures contracts traded at prices between $37 and $100, according to pricing data from TradingView.  Futures for the new token are trading in heavy backwardation on FTX, the largest filecoin futures market. Filecoin futures were trading hands around $15 on FTX at last check compared to $39.50 on Binance’s spot market, representing a basis of 160 percent, according to CoinGecko.  The protocol’s initial coin offering in July 2017 sold tokens to investors at a range of $1 to $5 with six-month to three-year vesting schedules, according to data from Messari. At current prices, early investors have earned between 700% and 3,900% returns over the past three years.  Filecoin’s remarkable early price action evoked a range of reactions from investors and market analysts.  After an erratic first few hours of trading, the futures backwardation seems to imply the market “pricing in future inflation” for filecoin’s supply, said Eric Turner, director of research at Messari, in a private message with CoinDesk.  Filecoin Simple Agreements for Future Tokens (SAFTs) with 6-month vesting schedules were priced between $18 and $19 right before trading officially launched, Turner noted.

42384937,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAm9ub,1602880485,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Has Light Response to OKEx While Ether Options Traders Make Beacon Bets,"Bitcoin rebounded from an OKEx-related drop; ether options traders may be beacon chain bearish.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $11,327 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Slipping 2% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $11,199-$11,623  BTC below its 10-day moving average but above the 50-day, a sideways signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin’s price moved as high as $11,623 late Thursday/early Friday but trades at that height were short-lived. Spot traders punched the sell button around 04:00 UTC (12:00 a.m ET) on the news that Malta-based exchange OKEx suspended withdrawals due to an investigation of a key operations person. Bitcoin fell as low as $11,199 on spot exchanges such as Bitstamp before rebounding a bit, up to $11,327 at press time.      Read More: Bitcoin Price Dips 3% on OKEx News, Analysts Aren’t Too Worried      Market analysts seem unfazed, saying OKEx’s situation will hardly affect crypto’s long-term fundamentals. Nonetheless, the circumstances seem a bit curious, according to George Clayton, managing partner of investment firm Cryptanalysis Capital.      “Kind of weird that a major exchange can be incapacitated by one guy,” Clayton told CoinDesk. “One would have thought that there would be contingency plans in place with that much at stake.”      William Purdy, an options trader and founder of analysis firm PurdyAlerts, noted the resilience of the market in the face of negative sentiment. “If this news occured in 2018, the market would have dropped 10%-15%,” he told CoinDesk. “However, now it is supported by the larger equity investors and traditional markets.”      Indeed, despite the drop, the price per one bitcoin is still hovering around the $11,400-$11,500 range it has been in since Oct. 9.      Yet, in the bitcoin options market, traders appear to be preparing for further fallout. Open interest in bitcoin options keeps trending upward, according to Purdy.      Specifically, Purdy sees a trend with an increase in the put/call ratio on bitcoin options. “High put/call here is bearish positioning by options traders who expect further downside,” he said.      These two trends combined reflect the possibility of big market movements in the near-term by options traders. “Bitcoin options open interest keeps climbing as the put-to-call ratio is seen increasing,” said Purdy. “Given the continuous increase in open interest, we will see a large liquidation move in the coming weeks.”    Lots of ether options expiring in December    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH), was down Friday trading around $366 and slipping 3.1% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).

Greg Magadini, co-founder and CEO of data aggregator Genesis Volatility, said the large number of options, mostly positioned short, for December expiration has to do with Ethereum’s plan to upgrade its network. Ethereum 2.0’s initiation will begin with the “beacon chain” where investors will stake ether to help jump-start the network. A date has not yet been set for the beacon chain launch but is expected in 2020.      “Ether options remain concentrated in December expiration,” Magadini told CoinDesk. ”Traders are net short in December far out of the money calls. This is most likely related to beacon chain launch positioning.”    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mostly red Friday.

""There shall be digital state money as legal tender, an e-krona, issued by the Riksbank,"" Ingves wrote in a Thursday economic note that amounts to his strongest statement yet in favor of a Swedish central bank digital currency (CBDC).  He pushed for Sweden's government to ""review the concept of legal tender"" and the legality of an e-krona is necessary to prepare Riksbank for a digital future.  Sweden's populace is abandoning cash for digital payments at a world-leading rate, he asserted.  That's prompting Riksbank to grapple with a CBDC. Although dozens of monetary authorities are now studying sovereign digital currencies, Sweden's is one of the few to actually pilot one.  Also notable: Sweden's e-krona pilot project is running on distributed ledger technology.  Ingves called upon the Riksdag and Sweden's government to address the digital shift with legislation.  Riksbank first called for the formation of a committee to study cash in April 2019. The proposal cleared the Riksdag that June but has sat with the government ever since. ""We also need help from"" the government, Ingves said.  ""The Riksbank has not yet taken a formal decision on whether or not to issue an e-krona,"" he said.

42384929,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAm9oJ,1602876309,Decentralized Data Storage's Only Competition Is the Public Cloud,"This week, the Filecoin mainnet finally went live. This is huge news, not only because of the anticipation following Filecoin’s large token offering in 2017, but because creating a vibrant ecosystem of decentralized cloud offerings is an important step in the maturation of the cloud.      I suspect my feelings on this development may surprise a few people, given that it means a high-profile organization is entering into direct competition with my company, Storj Labs. Instead, I see it as the further evolution of a necessary industry, one that we have helped lead for several years now.    Ben Golub is the executive chairman and CEO at Storj Labs, an open-source, decentralized cloud storage provider. He is a serial entrepreneur and the former CEO of Docker, Gluster and Plaxo.    See also: Filecoin Launch Finally Brings $200M ICO to Fruition      Equally important is strengthening the cantilever against the extreme concentration in the public cloud market. The top four providers (Amazon, Microsoft, Google and Alibaba) control 80% of the public cloud market, and are all among the top 10 global companies by market cap. We want the decentralized cloud to have multiple strong players who take different approaches, drive better economics for users and create innovation.      Storj Labs, and a number of others (including Sia, Maidsafe and now Filecoin) are betting that a decentralized approach to storage can revolutionize public cloud in much the same way that a decentralized approach to networks (i.e. the internet) revolutionized communications over the past three decades.      Rather than relying on expensive, capital-intensive data centers, we break data into small pieces, encrypt it and allow the data to be stored across 10s of thousands (and, hopefully soon, millions) of independently owned and operated drives. Since going into general availability in March, Storj has managed to create the equivalent of 26 data centers worth of capacity across a global network of thousands of independently run drives, spread across 85 countries, without taking a single plane trip, renting any space, buying any equipment, pouring any concrete, or, critically, consuming any extra power.    Decentralized storage and cloud must significantly decrease prices that end users pay.    Of course, the other advantage of having multiple players like Filecoin in a market is that it helps drive innovation and allows the market to see multiple approaches to solving a problem. Each of the decentralized storage players has its own unique areas of emphasis. Over the 16 months since Storj launched its first public beta of the V3 network, and in the six months that we’ve been in GA production, we’ve learned a few lessons.      We saw with Storj’s V2 network that it was relatively easy to build a large amount of storage capacity. But to ensure 100% file durability, 99.99% file availability and performance on par with the centralized cloud providers takes lots of hard work and iteration.      For the decentralized cloud to be more than a science experiment, it has to support mainstream and enterprise use cases well. This meant becoming compatible with the Amazon Web Services out of the gate, since that is by far the most frequently used interface for mainstream cloud applications. It also meant supporting integrations with a wide range of databases, replication tools and backup tools.      See also: Storj’s Decentralized Cloud Storage Service ‘Tardigrade’ Goes Live      There is also increasing momentum for the use of decentralized storage for edge use cases, which aim to push data closer to where it is consumed. As an increasing amount of data is collected, analyzed and distributed at the edge, it makes sense to store that data across a broad, globally distributed set of nodes as well, which improves performance, durability and data integrity.    Balancing two markets    Imagine how long Lyft would last if it only focused on drivers but didn’t have passengers. Or, conversely, if it had lots of passengers but no drivers. Decentralized networks need to get the balance right as well. While many decentralized networks say a lot about miners and node operators, they don’t necessarily have a lot to say about real-world usage of the network. This is fine during a test or startup stage, but long-term viability requires end users get sufficient value from the network and that supply and demand stay in sync.      To this end, decentralized storage and cloud must significantly decrease prices that end users pay. To do so, however, it has to be easy and economically viable to be a node operator. We purposely designed our network so network operators wouldn’t have to buy specialized equipment, consume large incremental amounts of power or expend time and effort on computational tasks that aren’t directly related to providing uptime, storage and connectivity.      We wanted to make it computationally expensive to cheat, but not computationally expensive to operate correctly. Having profitable, low-cost supply lets the network deliver storage at a fraction of the cost of the large, centralized providers.      The ability for a wide cross section of operators to provide storage profitably means we have a very broad cross section of people and organizations in 85 countries offering storage, with no large concentrations of nodes in any organization or geography. This is the dream of decentralization.      See also: InterPlanetary File System Is Uncensorable During Coronavirus News Fog      While we do have several corporate and university data centers bringing nodes to the network, the heart of the network remains the individual operator. In fact, the majority of the nodes on our network are operated by people who are operating two or fewer nodes. Over 80% of the pieces of data are stored on these nodes.      Part of the beauty of decentralized storage is there isn’t a single point of failure. Done correctly, no one should be able to see, mine or sell end user data. But that not only requires good decentralized design but also careful attention to things like meta data masking, end-to-end encryption and more.      Once again, a hearty welcome to the latest entrant to the decentralized storage space.

Read more: Huobi and OKEx Battle for Supremacy in China      There was speculation Huobi may have loaned assets to OKEx but, according to data provided by CryptoQuant, 997 BTC was transferred from Huobi to Binance at 10:21:30 UTC Friday, Oct. 16,. That transfer was also captured earlier by Twitter account @whale_alert, but was mistakenly said to have gone to OKEx.      “This was a normal withdrawal behavior,” Sun told CoinDesk about the transfer. “It did not trigger risk control and did not involve illegal operations. We cannot disclose our user information.”      Huobi does not appear to be negatively affected by the situation at OKEx either.      “At this time there’s no evidence to support that this could extend to Huobi as well,” Matthew Graham, chief executive officer of Beijing-based crypto consultancy Sino Capital, said in a direct message on Twitter with CoinDesk. “Our current understanding is that this is an issue that’s specific to OKEx.”      Sun told CoinDesk that Huobi has “invested” in anti-money laundering and fraud prevention “for a long time.”      Both Huobi and OKEx maintain close ties to the Chinese government despite moving offices out of the country after a crackdown on crypto trading in 2017. As regulators got tough on such things as initial coin offerings (ICO), representatives of BTCC, the first bitcoin cryptocurrency exchange in China, OKEx (OKCoin at the time) and Huobi met with officials from the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) and were warned to follow laws and regulation requirements closely.            In the aftermath of 2017, BTCC sold its entity to a Hong Kong-based blockchain investment fund while Huobi and OKEx essentially got a pass by moving their operations overseas. OKEx is headquartered in Hong Kong while being officially based in Malta. Huobi is based in Seychelles, the company’s PR representative told CoinDesk previously, and has offices in Singapore.      According to people familiar with the matter, that is partly due to both exchanges having a closer relationship with the Chinese government.

Bitcoin mining company HASHR8 just launched its Compass platform, a search engine of sorts for individual miners to shop for a hosting facility to operate their mining hardware for them. While mining farms hosting solo miners’ machines is nothing new, Compass is the first service to create a product to sync miners with hosting providers.      The initiative was born from a drive to keep Bitcoin’s hashrate distributed, and that starts with making sure the smaller-time miners can stay competitive.      Red more: Bitcoin Steady Above $11,400 as Hashrate Reaches New High      “We believe that everyone should have the ability to mine bitcoin. Nowadays the narrative is always that ‘bitcoin mining is only profitable for larger miners,’ which holds true because smaller miners cannot benefit from the same economies of scale. HASHR8 built Compass to kill that narrative,” HASHR8 COO Thomas Heller told CoinDesk.    Pointing bitcoin miners in the right direction    Compass curates a registry of verified mining facilities, which miners can query to search for facilities by region, energy price and hardware hosting minimums. Each mining farm’s profile also lists security features and whether it offers mining equipment for rent. Searchers have their choice of facilities from Canada, China, Iceland, Kazakhstan, Russia and the U.S.      Because they already had good working relationships, Heller told CoinDesk, HASHR8 reached out to the facilities currently listed on Compass to pioneer the program, but other mining farms can apply to be added, too. The hosts, not the solo miners, pay HASHR8 a fee for the service.      In addition to Compass, HASHR8 will also be launching Powerblocks this month. The service will allow individual miners to host a single device; in Heller’s view, this service gives “anyone an opportunity to start mining in a world-class facility.”      Read more: How Bitcoin Mining Works      “We want everyone to have access to the same great hardware and the same low hosting rates, whether they have $2,000 or $200,000, to get started mining bitcoin,” Heller continued.      At a time when Bitcoin’s hashrate is soaring while its price is slogging along, miners are eking out profits as revenue per terahash rests at all time lows. Smaller miners have been especially hurt by this cash-flow squeeze. Heller said that before we can hope to make them competitive with larger miners, “the first step is to get them in the game” with feasible hosting options.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | TRADING,"Colin Harper, Blockspace Media",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/10/16/this-new-service-plays-matchmaker-between-solo-miners-big-mining-farms,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/67fa02af0050344c1d0cb756e0e6ba3a30225b8b-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384921,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAm9cz,1602870768,Russian Metal Giant’s Tokenization Firm Expands to America,"Atomyze, a tokenization startup by Russian mining and smelting giant Nornickel, is setting up shop in Greenwich, Conn., to sell tokenized metals in the U.S.      The company, whose legal name is Atomyze LLC, will become the second foothold for Nornickel’s tokenization ambitions. It will work in parallel another entity that will tokenize Nornickel's metals, Tokentrust, which was launched in February in Switzerland. Atomyze does not currently have a presence in Russia.      There are two use cases for metal-backed tokens, Nornickel CEO Vladimir Potanin told CoinDesk last year. First, industrial producers can use such tokens to flexibly modify their contracts for the delivery of the actual metals.      Second, people interested in investing in the metal industry might use the tokens to bet on the prices of metals such as palladium, copper or nickel, instead of buying stock in companies like Nornickel.      Both Atomyze and Tokentrust will use a Hyperledger Fabric-powered backend coded by Nornickel’s engineers together with IBM, and will issue tokens backed by the mining giant’s inventory. Legally, however, their operations will be separated, as each company will only serve users in the country in which it is based – at least initially.      Nornickel did not respond to questions as to why the U.S. and Switzerland will be the first two markets for Atomyze by press time. The large U.S. market has been lucrative for financial service firms in general, even though there can be regulatory hurdles.      In Russia, meanwhile, the regulatory situation is getting clearer. This summer, a new law regulating digital asset issuance was passed, and starting in January issuers registered with the Bank of Russia will be able to launch tokens in a centralized, permissioned way.      Due to the regulatory differences in Switzerland and the U.S., the two firms will be issuing two distinct sets of tokens. At least in the initial phase, these tokens will not be interchangeable, said Jeanine Hightower-Sellitto, CEO of Atomyze LLC. She added that “Atomyze LLC was created with the vision of building the products that will be familiar and common for the U.S. market.”      Hightower-Sellitto, a Wall Street veteran and former managing director of operations at the Gemini crypto exchange, was named CEO of the company in September to build a commodity-backed token market fully compliant with U.S. regulations. Before Gemini, Hightower-Sellitto worked at Nasdaq subsidiary International Securities Exchange (ISE) for 13 years.      Along with Hightower-Sellitto, Atomyze now has a few professionals who came from notable crypto and blockchain companies. They include Corey Wendling, former senior vice president of Paxos; Jan Hendrik Scheufen, former chief product officer of the Scotland-based blockchain firm Monax; and Lyon Hardgrave, who used to lead the blockchain oil trading startup Vakt.      Wendling told CoinDesk via a spokesperson he was attracted to Atomyze’s ambition to “disrupt and change the way commodities are traded by allowing customers to bring their own smart contracts and tokens to our platform.”      “We are building a system that is flexible and highly customizable to be able to support many different types of assets,” Wendling said.      He added that, unlike the already existing tokenization platforms, Atomyze will take a more conservative, permissioned approach, which would give the customers more confidence about the platform’s security. This means new companies willing to issue tokens on the platform will not be able to use the technology independently but will need to work with Atomyze.    Metal bits    The metals themselves – palladium, platinum, nickel, cobalt and copper – will be kept in a secure vault that is physically located in the U.S., Hightower-Sellitto said. The name of the vault provider is not public, nor are the names of the banks to be involved with Atomyze LLC.      The contents of the vault will be audited by U.S.-based auditors to make sure the tokens are backed by the actual metals on a 1:1 basis, Hightower-Sellitto said.      She said that, at the moment, Atomyze is beginning to work on its money transmission and trust licenses in the U.S., and planning to launch in late Q1 of 2021.      Hightower-Sellitto hopes to see institutional investors like macro funds, hedge funds, endowments and accredited investors among Atomyze’s clients. Investing in metals themselves is different from investing in the stock of metal-producing companies, as this way investors can bet on the performance of entire industries as opposed to particular companies.      “You can invest in the car companies, you can invest in Tesla but there is a lot of noise in Tesla stock. So if you want to invest in the electric car market itself as a directional perspective you could invest in components of the electric car batteries,” Hightower-Sellitto said.      The tokens, which will be tradeable on Atomyze’s own platform, will not qualify as securities, Hightower-Sellitto said, and the company hasn’t had any communications with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission about them. This is because every token will be backed by actual metals, so the customers will participate in spot commodities transactions, Hightower-Sellitto said.      “It’s important for our product to be fully deliverable. No customer wants to enter into the spot transaction and then find out they actually are trading a product that is regulated as a swap of another kind of derivative,” she said.      Nornickel CEO Vladimir Potanin told CoinDesk in an October 2019 interview that tokenized metals would attract both industrial consumers and investors who don’t need actual palladium or nickel but would like to bet on their prices.      Swiss-based Tokentrust’s board includes Alexander Stoyanov, the managing director of Nornickel’s subsidiary Global Palladium Fund.      Global Palladium Fund will be the first issuer on Atomyze, Hightower-Sellitto said, but in the future the platform can also become a marketplace for other asset-backed tokens and more issuers might want to use it.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/10/16/russian-metal-giants-tokenization-firm-expands-to-america,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8accffe9962b49a429c237b9fa6dfcfe40f492a9-1200x900.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384936,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAm9s5,1602870113,How DeFi Can Avoid the Irrelevance of P2P Lending and Crowdfunding,"How many Libertarians do you think there are in the United States?      Everyone, right? Everybody wants personal freedom and a limited government. Just listen to Twitter bots and the talking heads on the propaganda channels. Everybody votes their principles and is internally consistent in their logic. Long live Ayn Rand!    Lex Sokolin, a CoinDesk columnist, is global fintech co-head at ConsenSys, a Brooklyn, N.Y.-based blockchain software company. The following is adapted from his Fintech Blueprint newsletter.    The answer is ... about 3% of the voting population.      About 3% of the population actually cares enough about their personal philosophy to lodge a particular vote in the direction of the Libertarian Party. We could have picked on the Green Party instead, or any other policy-oriented group, and gotten the same result. The reality is that everyone else votes Democrat or Republican because those are the teams that matter.      Everyone complains about Amazon but we all shop online. We mourn the loss of the neighborhood coffee shop but we buy Starbucks for the loyalty points. Thus the hypocrisy of human nature.      And here's the meat: We want peer-to-peer (p2p) economies, grounded in our neighborhoods and tribes. We think Wells Fargo and Bank of America and the Federal Reserve and the rest of ""them,"" whoever ""they"" are, are centralized monoliths running on papyrus and holding back innovation.      Right. Where do *you* bank exactly?    Peer to peerless    Do we really want peer-to-peer economies, though? Or are we lost in the poetry of utopia?      Remember Napster, Kazaa and BitTorrent, with their brick-through-the-window of the media industry? Initially, the naive reaction of the labels was to build digital rights management into music players, song files and any teenager onto whom they could tattoo the letter of the law. DRM didn't work, right?      Certainly one way to look at the explosion of file sharing is to focus on the absolute figures of people consuming media for free. The core question there is to ask whether those people would be paying consumers in the market in the first place, or whether radio and mixtapes have been replaced by the digital substitutes of ""piracy,"" YouTube copyright infringement, and other modern artifacts.      We don't know the answer. We suspect, however, that if you had the patience to suffer through a DJ's advertisements or had the time to rip tapes, you might be the kind of person who has the capacity to deal with managing the mechanics of using torrents for file sharing. The clearest formulation on this topic comes in the article ""The Fifth Era of Recorded Music"" from Bill Rosenblatt.      The media industry has been able to deploy a business model that uses the internet to deliver a better user experience when bundled with the law. It is a worse user experience to avoid it. DRM-free downloads have collapsed as a commercial model.      Put another way, a digital music company is as much a monopoly as its predecessor the record-label. Likely an even better one, given digital returns to scale. It is so good, that the peer-to-peer alternative loses as a value proposition.      In the same vein, it's hard to find good data on YouTube as a facilitator of copyright breach. But we know that a lot of websites and videos contain media content a record label would otherwise try to monetize. If that media is not on Spotify, it is very likely on YouTube, accessible for free. A proxy for this content are the take-down requests under the DMCA now numbering in the hundreds of millions.      Is that piracy? Maybe. It is certainly ""file sharing."" Is it peer-to-peer? Absolutely not.      Just because content is user-generated, that does not mean it is peer-to-peer. Google is the platform that mediates access and takes rent through advertising. Google is the platform worth over $1 trillion today. And this realization takes us to Lending Club.    Peerless lending    Lending Club represents an era of fintech credit. The core premise at its founding was to recreate the dynamics of the sharing and social media revolutions. Instead of mediating everything through the centralizing machine of a bank – and by the way banking licenses were sort of hard to find in 2006 – why not create a connective platform like Kazaa (a long defunct file-sharing service)? A bunch of people who need to borrow can show up with various credit risks. And a bunch of people who would like better investment returns can show up to assess those risks. And you, as the platform, take a cut.      Sound familiar? This section is a warning shot to Compound, Aave and the rest of the DeFi protocols that think that redefining technology redefines market structure, human nature and micro-economic behavior.    This section is a warning shot to Compound, Aave and the rest of the DeFi protocols that think that redefining technology redefines market structure.    The first problem is getting good risks. If you are a venue for emerging credit, the risks that come to your platform are subject to adverse selection and the lemons problem. So you need sufficient aggregation, correlated with heavy customer acquisition and branding costs, to create the asset class of reasonable credit exposure. This is also why digital asset fundraising platforms are having a hard time. Most good startups still want to raise money from Goldman Sachs, Google Ventures, and Andreessen Horowitz. Not Globacap, the investment software platform, despite such a site being a strong technical and market innovation.      The second problem is getting enough investors. Remember we started talking about Libertarians that actually vote their politics? The same dynamics are there for financial behavior. Nobody actually wants to do the homework of selecting Lending Club notes, which requires learning about credit risks and understanding complex financial geek jargon to pick an investment. And the investors you get, especially if they are retail, are lumpy and finicky. Your liabilities do not match the time horizon of thousands of people, flickering about with their needs.      By the way, this is a problem Dimensional Fund Advisors solved 40 years ago. Instead of selling its mutual funds to retail – and dealing with constant redemptions and purchases – it targeted only institutional distributors (RIAs). This strategy meant the financial product had less turnover and generated better returns. It all worked, until the ETF [exchange-traded fund] product packaging came along, which did not even require fund redemptions and purchases to take place, instead letting retail investors trade the abstraction of an index as a share.      So you soldier on and bring in hard-nosed hedge fund capital. A private equity firm here and there, to package up all those Lending Club notes and smooth out the risks. Maybe sell them downstream into fixed income funds. Of course the cost of this funding from alternative financiers is really high, because their job is to take the entire economic return and you have no pricing power. So you decide to aggregate your own capital through deposits and buy Radius bank.      See also: Lex Sokolin - The Revolution You’ve Been Awaiting: Fintech + DeFi      And then you give up on peer-to-peer lending entirely. You're a bank now anyway. Why would you need this onerous many-to-many platform, when you can just offer some ""high-yield"" savings accounts.      It sucks. Peer-to-peer lending is dead. It was never going to work without a centralizing function to standardize deposits and slice up the risks. And the amount of people who ""want"" peer-to-peer is like the number of Libertarians. You and I still bank at the financial incumbent for 80% of our needs, and send 5% into a fintech digital lender for experimentation.      What's the exception? What's the Google of this world? Let's look at our friends in China.      This geography too had a p2p lending explosion, which in large part involved fraud and bankruptcy. From the peak of 3,500 digital lender platforms, around 600 remain standing. Among them are the giants of Ant Financial and Tencent's WeBank. The high tech platforms outlived all of the individual fintech competitors, and used their size and credibility with regulators to remain in business. Everyone else is being effectively shamed and shut down.      Returns to scale have come from being a technology monopoly. Financial features are the monetization cherry on top.    Crowdless funding    In an eerily similar fashion, the same challenge is hitting the equity crowdfunding industry. We have been bearish on these platforms because of the Libertarian (i.e., small market, low commitment) problem. The profile of a financial consumer that likes to make some-but-not-all financial decisions is a myth. The failures of Covestor, Motif, Kaching and other digital wealth platforms promoting a semi-active investing style in the U.S. highlights the problem. The U.K., on the other hand, still holds on to a functioning narrative about this sector.      Some of the early neobank players, like Monzo and Tandem, engaged with the crowdfunding market to raise single-digit million amounts from thousands of excited supporters. Those supporters were also early-users of the neobank products. The positive relationship between investors and users spun out into the story that crowdfunding is a successful economic arrangement, and that the crowdfunding platforms themselves will be the next generation of investment banking. To do this, the platforms had to do the heavy lifting to impact regulation that created operating models allowing regular people to access the venture asset class. And yet last week, Crowdcube and Seedrs (the two arch-rivals of equity crowdfunding in the U.K.) announced a 60-40 merger and a likely need for future growth equity.    Or perhaps, unlike the media industry, the financial industry has not yet been able to deploy a business model that uses the internet to deliver a better user experience.    There are three takeaways for us. First, you have to make this market 1,000 times larger. If we were talking about a merger of £4 billion and £7 billion in revenue, rather a few million in revenue, then it would matter a lot more. One way to do that is by bypassing the geographic and regulatory boundaries under which Seedrs and Crowdcube have had to operate. This is in large part why crypto markets print large numbers – they are global, including the United States, Brazil, China, Russia and the African continent. There is always demand somewhere.      Second, the adverse selection problems remain in the asset class. Why are these unique or exciting investment opportunities? Who really cares about putting money into a local small business and facing 100% loss when you can buy Amazon stock and watch it go to $2 trillion? Who really cares about buying coffee from the local shop when they have the Starbucks app and rewards cards? If you had more investors on Seedrs, would the Silicon Valley tech players (like Slack) decide to IPO there instead of the New York Stock Exchange? You can see this same theme playing out in the acquisition of SharesPost by Forge earlier this year.      And finally, there is hope. The incentive alignment between people who crowdfunded the neobanks and then became users of those applications is profound. This is exactly the dynamic that crypto protocols have been ideating around. See this write up: ""Liquidity Mining: A User-Centric Token Distribution Strategy"" or the ConsenSys approach to the same problem here.      Crowdfunding works not when there is ""access"" but when there is something to achieve by participation. In today's world, that something is largely financial return. To be honest, it is sometimes confounding how Initial Coin Offerings – the next generation version of crowdfunding – were able to raise $20 billion over two years. Or how Decentralized Finance, the next generation version of blockchain-based capital markets, has been able to manage a $15 billion capital base.      Perhaps the capital itself is far more risk-seeking, and is in the appropriate part of the portfolio (i.e., alternatives). Perhaps the community aspects are far stronger than in the crowdfunding model, and thus viral coefficients are higher, leading to faster social distribution. Perhaps the interoperability of issuance and trading allows for quicker monetization, and a sense that these markets are worth the trouble.      Or perhaps, unlike the media industry, the financial industry has not yet been able to deploy a business model that uses the internet to deliver a better user experience when bundled with the law. We are all still working to figure it out.    Takeaways    We are in a world where Morgan Stanley has acquired Smith Barney, eTrade and is now adding Eaton Vance for $7 billion. The esteemed institutional businesses are in the retail hen house.      That's $1.2 trillion in assets under management in manufacturing and $3.3 trillion of assets in distribution.      In the political sense, choosing among Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, Bank of America, and Goldman Sachs is like choosing between Democrats and Republicans. Regardless of your niche political beliefs, you should pick a party that matters – not the Libertarians. Don't take this as a comment on the current election, in which we can say the sane choice is far narrower (self-destruction vs. attempted redemption). It is a comment on power structure and how consumers of financial services behave.      Peer-to-peer models have not become a stable market equilibrium. While p2p activity continues in media, digital monopolies wielding the law have re-emerged and are more powerful than ever. In p2p lending, the original innovators have exited the business in favor of a more straightforward, scalable solution called banking. In p2p crowdfunding, the market is consolidating and showing limited growth economics.      Is this a feature or a bug?      What we can do in the blockchain experiment is to position mutually owned protocols as market venues, such as Uniswap, Compound and Curve, and create feedback loops for both companies and users that incentivize them to choose open-source standards over closed solutions.      But it won't be an easy win against human nature and our collective resistance to change. Linux and Wikipedia have shown us one way. Another way is that parts of the enterprise economy find meaningful value in decentralized networks and commit not to cheat in the Prisoner's Dilemma. Or perhaps it will be a national priority for China to integrate all economic activity into its blockchain service network, and that will be the Sputnik moment for the rest of the world.

For example, Quantstamp’s Juliano Martinez said the “high volume” of applicants has led to his company “rejecting lots of projects.” The months-long backlog comes amid a sharp pullback across the $11 billion DeFi market, with most tokens down 19% over the last 30 days, according to Messari.      Bitcoin grants Coinbase is sponsoring at least two Bitcoin Core developers with its new Crypto Community Fund. The San Francisco-based exchange announced the grant program Thursday, after years of pushback from the crypto community that Coinbase was profiting from bitcoin’s open-source nature without paying in. Direct contributions to and review of Bitcoin Core, contributor tooling, Bitcoin libraries and testing improvements are all applicable to the grant program. Coinbase would not reveal the size of the fund but did say in an emailed statement that it hopes to increase the fund over time.      DLT defense The Trump Administration has included “distributed ledger technologies” (DLT) in its strategy for preserving America’s technological supremacy over China and Russia. DLT is one of 20 focus areas on the National Security Council's ""critical and emerging technologies"" shortlist, released Thursday. The NSC's strategy calls for investing in, developing, adopting and promoting the priority technologies, which also include AI, data science, quantum computing and ""space technologies,"" weapons of mass destruction mitigation technologies, and others.      Election 2020 The Associated Press has teamed up with Wikipedia alternative Everipedia to preserve the 2020 U.S. election results. More than 7,000 state and national election race calls will be recorded on Everipedia’s EOS-based platform. Once a race is called, that information is entered into another internal AP system. Everipedia will pull the final declaration from an API and record it on its own ledger, permanently storing what AP sees as the final result. That said, race calls themselves will be recorded on the Ethereum blockchain and Chainlink will serve as intermediary between the AP data and Everipedia.      Digital Nigeria Nigeria’s federal government is reportedly developing an ambitious plan to facilitate national crypto adoption with the vision of creating a “Digital Nigeria.” According to an early draft of the strategy framework obtained by local publication Technology Times, the country’s Federal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy and the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) have partnered to develop a blueprint for national blockchain adoption. Nigeria’s mission is to drive adoption of the technology in public administration, leading to improved efficiency, transparency and accountability, according to the document.

Crypto’s reaction to news of one of the industry’s most active spot and derivatives exchanges, OKEx, pausing withdrawals has been decidedly muted.      Friday morning local time, the Hong Kong-headquartered (but Malta-based) trading platform announced it has suspended all cryptocurrency withdrawals indefinitely. One of the necessary signatories, OKEx co-founder Mingxing ""Star"" Xu, had been taken into police custody.      Bitcoin dropped approximately 3% on the news. Most other large-cap cryptos also fell.      OKEx CEO Jay Hao said over Weibo the key holder's cooperation with officials was due to a ""personal issue"" and the investigation would not affect the business. The exchange clarified hours later, ""funds are safe and all other functions on OKEx are unaffected.""      Approximately 200,000 bitcoins – worth some $2.3 billion – are currently held in OKEx wallets, according to Glassnode. The company claims on its website to serve millions of customers in 100 countries.      Star – taken into custody a week ago for unknown, though supposedly “personal” reasons – being out of touch prevented withdrawal authorization from being completed. ""We will resume digital assets/cryptocurrencies withdrawals immediately once the concerned private key holder is able to authorize the transaction,” the exchange wrote.      The incident draws parallels to last year’s collapse of QuadrigaX, a Canadian exchange that held its and customer assets in cold storage protected by a single key setup. That signatory has died under mysterious circumstances, leading to an ongoing effort to return assets to their owners.      “Read between the lines – OKEx has a single point of failure in their key management architecture, and it's currently failing,” Jameson Lopp, CTO of Casa, tweeted. He added later, “Either they have a distributed redundant setup as claimed on their security page OR there is a single key holder whose disappearance halts spending.”      Others have noted OKEx previously boasted of its contingency plans put in place for such scenarios.      In either case, with approximately 1.1% of the total circulating BTC supply currently frozen, market analysts remain cool-headed.      ""I don't think BTC will necessarily dive from here; the fund flow may look for venues that are based in countries with clearer regulatory stance and policy outlook,"" Denis Vinokourov, head of research at London-based prime brokerage Bequant, told CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole.

42432951,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO2HVh,1602861018,Money Reimagined: How Ethereum 2.0's 'Lockup' Will Drive DeFi Innovation,"The “Summer of DeFi” might be over, but a looming event will give DeFi engineers a great incentive to crank up their “lego” innovation model and build more decentralized finance products: the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade. (See CoinDesk’s explainer here.)      With thousands of Ethereum 2.0 validators expected to stash more than 500,000 ether in a restrictive multi-year lockup, there will be significant demand for a creative solution that unlocks the value of those funds without undermining the upgrade mission. DeFi innovators will be happy to oblige.      It’s a process of demand and supply that’s similar to how Wall Street’s “engineers” respond with new financial instruments when rules imposed on traditional markets put constraints on investors. It matters not that the behavior-constraining rules are imposed by a government regulator or, in the Ethereum 2.0 case, by a protocol. Constraints create an incentive for financial creativity.      Also, as with many Wall Street inventions, this one will create an interesting byproduct. As markets arise in the new instruments, their price signals will indicate how people think this massive Ethereum protocol change is performing.    The lockup    As discussed during CoinDesk’s invest: ethereum economy conference this past Wednesday, “phase 0” of Ethereum’s migration to a proof-of-stake blockchain involves having 16,384 validators each commit to place 32 ETH in a soon-to-be-announced deposit contract. Those tokens will then be “staked” to secure and govern a new parallel Ethereum blockchain known as Beacon, which will function as a live environment for testing the proof-of-stake system to which all of Ethereum will eventually migrate.      The key point is that the locked ETH cannot be sent back to the original Ethereum blockchain and cannot be accessed until the two systems are merged and the duplicate ETH on the legacy chain destroyed.      The current timeline for the lockup is 18 months, but given how long it has taken for this first phase of Ethereum 2.0 to start, it could well take much longer. This transition is going to be difficult, not just technically but also economically, with its biggest challenge being how to manage incentives so everyone else moves their ether out of the legacy proof-of-work chain into the new one.      Those decisions can be affected by a host of unknown variables. It’s one reason why it’s hard to argue with Radix CEO Piers Ridyard, who talked during one panel discussion Wednesday, of “Ethereum 2.0’s epic complexity.”      So, there’s much at stake (quite literally) for the validators involved in Beacon. And while the total amount locked, worth $198 million based on current ether prices, is less than half of a percent of Ethereum’s total $42 billion market capitalization, these particular funds matter.      By definition, these are high-energy funds. They are held by true believers in the Ethereum mission, who are actively interested in how it evolves, not by casual ETH investors. They are precisely the kinds of people who’ll be open to innovative solutions on how to unlock their value.      Given what we know about how DeFi innovators use oracles and smart contracts to create new assets like “wrapped” (or tokenized) bitcoin, taking value created in one chain and use it as collateral in another, it’s a solid bet that new tokenizing contracts will be used to bring liquidity to all that otherwise locked ether. They’ll be bought and sold as tokens but also used as collateral in DeFi lending markets.    ETH 2.0 bonds    The locked ether presents a contract that promises a set of contingent future cash flows, with properties akin to certain types of bonds. In fact, that is what DeFi-ers will create: tokenized ETH 2.0 bonds.      By transferring a token created by a fully collateralized smart contract to a creditor, validators can receive funds in unlocked original ether and, in return, promise that when the blockchain merger happens and the lockup ends, the creditor will automatically receive the original 32 ETH plus the accumulated staking rewards.      Based on staking reward projections built into the system’s monetary supply, these “bonds” would earn a 20% yield on an annualized basis and then fall according to a sliding scale, as the total amount of staked grows.      What’s not known is the precise date at which the funds will be unlocked or the value of the ether in dollar terms at that time. Both are somewhat dependent on how well and how efficiently Ethereum developers progress toward the goal of a full integrated Ethereum 2.0 transition. But they are also dependent on whether, all things considered, the broader Ethereum community thinks the migration to the new proof-of-stake system is worth it.      What we could see, then, is the market prices for tokenized locked ETH bonds becoming, in effect, an assessment of how well these pieces are coming together. Whether this creates a positive feedback loop that gives developers a real-time sentiment signal to help them gauge whether the market thinks they are on target to achieve their goals, or whether it creates misaligned incentives to rush through upgrades that aren’t yet ready, remains to be seen.    What we could see, then, is the market prices for tokenized locked ETH bonds becoming, in effect, an assessment of how well these pieces are coming together.    For the rest of us, this live market in “Ethereum 2.0 futures” will provide a great talking point and measuring stick.      It’s not unlike products such as the CME Group’s “Federal Funds Futures,” which (before interest rates became anchored at near zero) functioned as a gauge of market expectations for the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decisions.      Another is the TIPS breakeven-even inflation rate, whose correlations with bitcoin we discussed two weeks ago.That metric takes the differential between yields on regular Treasury bonds and those on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), whose payments are tied to the consumer price index, as a market-based measure of people’s expectations for inflation.      In both cases, the financial engineering behind the product was initially meant to give investors protection against an event that’s contingent on a policy constraint, but the product evolved into a valuable economic indicator in its own right.      This Ethereum 2.0 process is going to be fascinating.    Betting on uncertainty    We talk a lot about the case for bitcoin as an uncorrelated hedge against a future political meltdown in the global economic system. That story is enhanced by concerns that next month’s high-stakes U.S. presidential election could be fraught with tension. With long delays expected in a vote count skewed by mail-in ballots, and with President Trump continuing to suggest that he might contest the result, many are questioning whether democracy itself is on the ballot this year.      And yet, for now at least, perhaps until there is an actual break in the prevailing system, it seems bitcoin won’t likely trade directly against election results, but rather track the election-driven performance of equities, with which it has been correlated over recent months.      If you want to look at how investors are betting on the prospect of turmoil, look instead to the options market, where derivatives can pay out in the event markets become more volatile to the upside, downside or both. And there, as The Wall Street Journal reported last Friday, we are seeing “bets go beyond the Wall Street hedging that typically precedes an election.”      One classic indicator found in the chart provided in that article, shows how futures contracts on the CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX – whose payout to investors is based on the extent of future swings in the S&P 500 index – are priced in terms of the month in which those contracts expire. What’s notable is not just the predictable spike in the November VIX contract’s price, but also how it takes some time for later-dated contracts to ease in price. Bumpy times lie ahead.    Global town hall    NERVOUS GERMANS. Speaking of election expectations, YouGov’s recent survey of European opinion is worth reflecting on. The world’s confidence in the U.S. has ramifications for the dollar’s sustainability as the world’s reserve currency, among other issues. And it produced some striking – nay, alarming – results.      In a survey covering Germany, France, Britain, Sweden, Denmark, Italy and Spain, the percentage of respondents who said they believed U.S. elections would be “completely free and fair” ranged from 2% to 11%, while those who believed they would be “mostly free and fair” were spread in a 27%-37% range. No country, it seems, had more than 50% of respondents expressing confidence the election would respect the norms of democracy. In Germany, whose history naturally creates a wariness of power abuse, a meager 25% believed U.S. elections would be either completely or mostly free and fair.      It’s well known that Europeans tend to hold an especially negative view of President Trump, which could skew the data away from a more dispassionate understanding of the workings of American democracy and whether to trust it. Even so, these numbers are a wake-up call, especially for people like us who are interested in the future of money.      American currency hegemony is founded on the international faith in its leadership of the global capitalist system, which is founded in principles of market democracy. Within that, there is a basic understanding the U.S. political system will continue to enable a peaceful, trusted transfer of power as it has generally achieved throughout the 76 years in which the dollar has been the world’s reserve currency.      Anytime I warn of the end of the dollar’s reign, I inevitably attract naysayers who point out there is no likely successor and, by extension, argue the current system will keep muddling along, regardless of whether the rest of the world trusts America or not. That might be true, but it assumes the only way forward is for the current monolithic system to be replaced by another monolithic system, as happened when the dollar replaced the British pound as the world’s reserve currency.      But that need not be the case. A multi-currency world is quite possible, especially when you take into account how blockchain and digital asset technology is fostering a proliferation of new alternatives, whether issued by central banks (China’s digital yuan), companies (libra) or decentralized communities (bitcoin.) The more those alternatives mature, the more significant a breakdown in international trust in the U.S. matters as a potential catalyst for change.      CANADA IN A HURRY. Reports from a Canadian virtual event on Thursday suggest the Bank of Canada wants to speed up its adoption of a digital currency. BOC Deputy Governor Timothy Lane believes COVID-19 will accelerate the release of a central bank digital currency. A “shift in spending habits” triggered the pandemic, “coupled with the speed of technological developments, has narrowed the window to deliver a digital currency issued by the central bank,” the CBC reported Lane as saying.      It’s the latest in a palpable advance for central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), with many central bankers and government officials now weighing in on this topic. The European Central Bank has upped its rhetoric and last week the U.S. Treasury Department sounded more interested in the idea. It wasn’t exactly a huge statement when Deputy Treasury Secretary Justin Muzinic told an Atlantic Council event last week a CBDC was “something we’re studying.” But it was a significant signal from a department that has been reluctant to show its hand on this issue.      Is COVID-19 really the catalyst? Might it be that China is marching ahead at a pace that no one expected? (See “Relevant Reads” below.”) There’s nothing like competition and geopolitical challenges to stir governments into action. Expect all this talk to get louder in Western countries. And then action.    Relevant reads    Nearly 2 Million Sign Up for China’s Digital Yuan ‘Lottery’. When China wants to run a live test of a new idea, it has the convenience of being able to sign up a massive number of people and still treat it as a small, low-risk portion of its 1.3 billion population. Even so, the huge “airdrop” of China’s new digital currency into Shenzhen, reported here by CoinDesk’s Sebastian Sinclair, is a major development. China’s Digital Currency Electronic Payments (DCEP) is live. Much will be learned from this – though it’s not clear how much of that information will be shared with the outside world.      Trump’s Security Hawks Call Distributed Ledgers ‘Critical’ in US-China Tech Arms Race. Finally, it seems the U.S. government has noticed China is barrelling ahead with blockchain technology. In this report from CoinDesk’s Danny Nelson, we learn that President Trump’s National Security Council has included digital ledger technology in its ""critical and emerging technologies"" shortlist for the purposes of maintaining U.S. supremacy over China. Is a war using weaponized state-controlled private blockchains in the offing?      Filecoin Launch Finally Brings $200M ICO to Fruition. The initial coin offering (ICO) boom is often derided for bringing worthless projects to market and enabling quick exits for scammy founders. But some of the ideas spawned were truly revolutionary. One of those is Filecoin, which is really just one piece of a far bigger project, the Interplanetary File System. IPFS, if it succeeds, will radically change the entire structure of the World Wide Web, shifting its file storage, website hosting and indexing system to a decentralized model without hosting services becoming single points of failure (or censorship targets.) Filecoins are its mechanism for incentivizing and governing storage providers across the network. Now, after a $200 million token offering in 2017, it has finally gone live (albeit with some constraints on token liquidity) amid fervent speculation on its value. Read Brady Dale and Sebastian Sinclair’s breakdown of the launch and what it means.      First Mover: Privacy Is Litecoin’s Ace in the Hole as JPMorgan Touts Bitcoin. For some time during bitcoin’s early days, litecoin attracted a lot of attention as an altcoin. But in recent years it has fallen from view and its price has sagged relative to bigger digital assets such as ether, even though the cryptocurrency remains sufficiently sought-after to sit within the CoinDesk 20. Now, as CoinDesk’s Dan Cawrey reported in one of our daily First Mover newsletters this week, Litecoin is adding key privacy features to its cryptocurrency to protect users from surveillance.

In the first two weeks of October, monthly trading volume for the TRUMP and BIDEN markets eclipsed prior high set in March when the coronavirus public health and economic crisis brought the Trump Administration and prospects of his reelection to the fore of nearly every news cycle, domestic and international.  Known for its cutting-edge cryptocurrency futures products, FTX has benefited from this non-crypto offering as well. The markets have served as a “surprisingly strong” funnel for new users, CEO Sam Bankman-Fried told CoinDesk in a private message.  Both markets represent 22% of referral traffic to FTX, according to data from web analytics service Similar Web, the largest share of any FTX referrer, thanks to links and data posted to electionbettingodds.com.  Though the betting is on the outcome of the U.S. presidential election, anyone who could cast an actual vote for either candidate on Nov. 3 is excluded from the action in FTX’s markets because the exchange’s services are not available in the United States.  With the election less than three weeks away, the TRUMP market commands nearly double the volume of its counterpart, the BIDEN futures contract.  Even though volume for each election market is relatively small compared to similar offerings on other betting sites, the market behavior aligns fairly well with larger election prediction markets.  For example, PredictIt shows a lead for former Vice President Joe Biden ($0.65) over President Donald Trump ($0.40) similar to FTX’s Biden ($0.65) lead over Trump ($0.36).  Bankman-Fried told CoinDesk he is ""looking into"" building more of these non-crypto markets in the future.

42432947,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO2HPh,1602860101,"Nigerian Banks Shut Them Out, so These Activists Are Using Bitcoin to Battle Police Brutality","As protests surge through Nigeria in response to police brutality, one enclave of protestors has turned to bitcoin as a financial lifeline during turbulent times.      The Feminist Coalition's bank account was shuttered this month after its involvement in the End SARS protests came to light, according to a person familiar but unaffiliated with the group who asked to be identified as Emma (a pseudonym). End SARS is a movement in Nigeria to abolish the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), a subdivision of the police force with a track record of abusing and harassing citizens.      Read more: Unconfiscatable? Using Bitcoin to Resist Police Extortion in Nigeria      Cast out of the traditional system, the Feminist Coalition is now raising donations in bitcoin.    The #EndSARS protests    The Feminist Coalition was founded in July with a mission to “champion equality for women in Nigerian society with core focuses of education, financial freedom, and representation in public office.”      With the outbreak of protests against police brutality this month, the group has concentrated on providing medical care, legal aid and even funeral funding for those participating in the peaceful demonstrations.      Since the protests surfaced in the beginning of October, 10 Nigerians have died at the hands of police, according to CNN.      As of Oct. 16, the Feminist Coalition has collected a total of 69,891,637.15 naira (a couple bucks shy of $185,000), 15,443,280.00 of which ($40,000) has been deployed to aid 128 protests across the country, according to the coalition's website.    Bitcoin and censorship-resistant fundraising    All of this fundraising attracted the attention of authorities, though, and they were shut out of Flutterwave, the payments platform and something of a virtual bank they used to process donations. (At press time, Flutterwave had not returned CoinDesk's request for comment).      That’s when they turned to alternatives.      “Quite a few members of the group work in tech,” so they made the decision to use bitcoin as another payment option, said Emma.      They started by using Sendcash, a platform which converts bitcoin payments into naira and then deposits these funds into a recipient’s Nigerian bank account. The service is intuitive and highly useful, but it carries the risk that banks will almost certainly sniff out the source of the Feminist Coalition’s funds and shut down its accounts again.      The coalition no longer uses Sendcash because of this likely outcome. But they still accept bitcoin: Alex Gladstein, the Chief Strategy Officer of the Human Rights Organization, set them up with a BTCPay Server. Emma called the self-hosted payment process “a safer wallet” compared to other options.      Read more: Human Rights Foundation Funds Bitcoin Privacy Tools Despite ‘Coin Mixing’ Legal Stigma      Because it operates obliquely to the banking system, the censorship-resistant payment portal is an essential tool for the Feminist Coalition’s fundraising, Gladstein told CoinDesk.      “I would say BTCPay is important because it protects the privacy of donors and prevents the government from easily figuring out what service the protestors are using to cash out their bitcoin into naira,” he said.      Since adding the BTCPay bitcoin donation option on Oct. 14, the coalition has amassed roughly 3.14 BTC (~$36,000).    Bigger than Bitcoin    As CoinDesk has reported previously, Nigerians are no strangers to how the Bitcoin system lets them move money in the shadows of the legacy financial system.      Some Nigerian expats, for instance, use the Paxful exchange to send remittance funds back home, while others use bitcoin to trade directly with China.      More germane to the recent protests against police brutality, others have even used Bitcoin as an unconfiscatible bank account to avoid police shakedowns for cash. As though they see the writing on the wall, the Nigerian government is also spinning up a digital version of the naira.      Still, Emma said that bitcoin is “not popular among the masses yet at all. There are large barriers mostly in terms of education. However, a lot of young Nigerians are now starting to adopt cryptocurrency and it’s growing across the population.”      Further, the Feminist Coalition’s successful fundraising using bitcoin sheds “some positive light on cryptocurrency,” she says, and promotional efforts by Binance in Nigeria are also softening Bitcoin stigma in the country.      Of course, Bitcoin is only one tool in Nigeria’s fight for civil rights – it is not a cure – all for its citizens. What's really needed is concrete reform.      Read more: Nigerians Are Using Bitcoin to Bypass Trade Hurdles With China      Nigerians have been protesting as far back as 2016, Emma said, for SARS’ abolition and for police reform. It wasn’t until the most recent bout of unrest beginning in October that the government acquiesced to the protestors’ demands and formally disbanded SARS.      To many Nigerians, though, this is merely political theatre, and they expect SARS abuses to migrate to one of the new task forces that the government is forming to take its place. That’s why the protests haven’t stopped, Emma said, “because [Nigerians] want to see actual change in terms of police reform.”      With SARS now abolished, though, the protesters’ something-of-a-victory has left Emma hopeful. Not necessarily that things will immediately change, but that the Nigerian people, collectively, are beginning to “wake up” to the government’s abuses.      There’s more activity now than ever pressing for change, she said, and that’s something to be thankful for.      “We’re very tired of the lies and deceit, and there’s a widespread consciousness and awakening among young Nigerians right now that many are saying they’ve never seen before. I know I’ve never seen it before and I’m so relieved that it’s finally here.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | BNB,"Colin Harper, Blockspace Media",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/10/16/nigerian-banks-shut-them-out-so-these-activists-are-using-bitcoin-to-battle-police-brutality,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fd3949546b3f999373029c322ea5b9df7bb863b4-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The executive is the holder of a private key needed to authorize withdrawals, and that became impossible since he was out of touch, the exchange wrote in a notice published early Friday morning. Officials with OKEx, which is based in Malta but led by Chinese executives, said the issue involved a personal matter, not the exchange and shouldn't affect ongoing business.      Traders said the price impact might be short-lived. “I don’t think this news colors BTC the wrong way as much as it does the venue,” Vishal Shah, a trader and founder of the Alpha 5 exchange, told CoinDesk.    Market moves    Decentralized finance, or DeFi, is one of the hottest trends in the crypto industry. So it’s not surprising the DeFi craze would find its way to China, which has an active cryptocurrency community despite government restrictions on trading and token sales.  Chinese startups are playing a crucial role in the DeFi boom with highly localized and nimble adaptations of western projects as well as a marketing apparatus that is laser-focused on Chinese crypto communities, industry watchers say.      From July through the middle of October, the number of searches for DeFi has soared on China’s social media platform WeChat. It has almost doubled during this period of time, according to WeChat Index, a data analysis tool that includes keyword searches, articles and forwards in WeChat moments.  Major Defi projects such as NEST, DForce and YFII, all with huge Chinese followings, have raised millions of dollars in the span of a few weeks and topped the TVL ranking on DeFi Pulse.  China often has a reputation for adapting western products to local markets, or in some cases mimicking them. Compound alleged China-based DForce “stole” its code and Chinese liquidity mining site YFII cloned another foreign-based project, Yearn.Finance (YFI).      “Admittedly, many Chinese projects copy code from western DeFi pioneers such as the liquidity leader Yearn.Finance and decentralized exchange UniSwap,” Nervos co-founder Guoning Lü told CoinDesk. “However, Chinese companies are making innovations in localizing the original products and that is what makes DeFi products more popular in the country.”  - David Pan  Read More: How the DeFi Craze Made Its Way to China    Bitcoin watch    Bitcoin is down but not out and unlikely to see a price crash due to the announcement that the digital-asset exchange OKEx had suspended withdrawals.      The cryptocurrency is currently trading near $11,300, representing a 2% decline on the day. Prices fell from $11,519 to $11,231 in the 30 minutes to 04:30 UTC, roughly in line with the timing of the exchange's announcement, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.      OKEx announced an indefinite suspension of withdrawals, saying one of its private key holders was cooperating with police in investigations and thus being out of touch. As per latest reports, that private key holder is the exchange's founder, Mingxing Xu.      As such, the market sentiment may remain weak for some time, although a price crash looks unlikely.      “I don’t think BTC will necessarily dive from here,” Denis Vinokourov, head of research at London-based prime brokerage Bequant told CoinDesk. “The fund flow may look for venues that are based in countries with clearer regulatory stance and policy outlook.”      Besides, the cryptocurrency has recently absorbed bigger shocks like BitMEX's indictment by U.S. regulators, President Donald Trump's health scare and the fiscal impasse in the U.S.      With prices holding above the former resistance-turned-support of $11,200 (Sept. 18 high), the immediate bias remains bullish.

42432944,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO2HFh,1602852306,Five Machine Learning Methods Crypto Traders Should Know About,"In a recent article, I discussed the relevance of the machine learning techniques powering the famous OpenAI’s GPT-3 could have for the crypto market. GPT-3 – which can answer questions, perform language analysis and generate text – might be the most famous achievements in recent years of the deep learning space. But, by no means, is it the most applicable to the crypto space. In this article, I would like to discuss some novel areas of deep learning that can have a near immediate impact in the quant models applied to crypto.    Jesus Rodriguez is the CEO of IntoTheBlock, a market intelligence platform for crypto assets. He has held leadership roles at major technology companies and hedge funds. He is an active investor, speaker, author and guest lecturer at Columbia University in New York.    Models such as GPT-3 or Google’s BERT are the result of a massive breakthrough in deep learning known as language pretrained and transformer models. These techniques, arguably, represent the biggest milestone in the last few years of the deep learning industry and their impact hasn’t gone unnoticed in capital markets.      In the last year, there have been active research efforts in quantitative finance exploring how transformer models can be applied to different asset classes. However, the results of these efforts remain sketchy showing that transformers are far from ready to operate in financial datasets and they remain mostly applicable to textual data. But there is no reason to feel bad. While adapting transformers to financial scenarios remains relatively challenging, other new areas of the deep learning space are showing promise when applied in quant models on various asset classes including crypto.      From many angles, crypto seems to be like the perfect asset class for deep learning-based quant models. That’s because of the the digital DNA and the transparency of crypto assets and that the rise of crypto has coincided with a renaissance of machine learning and the emergence of deep learning.      After decades of struggle and a couple of so-called “artificial intelligence (AI) winters,” deep learning has finally become real and somewhat mainstream across different areas of the software industry. Quantitative finance has been one of the fastest adopters of new deep learning technologies and research. It is very common for some of the top quant funds in the market to experiment with the same types of ideas coming out of high tech AI research labs such as Facebook, Google or Microsoft.      See also: Jesus Rodriguez - 10 Reasons Quant Strategies for Crypto Fail      Some of the most exciting developments in modern quant financing are not coming from flashy techniques like transformers, but from exciting machine learning breakthroughs that are more developed for quant scenarios. Many of those methods are perfectly applicable to crypto-asset quant techniques and are starting to make inroads in crypto quant models.      Below, I’ve listed five emerging areas of deep learning that are particularly important to crypto quant scenarios. I tried to keep the explanations relatively simple and tailored to crypto scenarios.    1) Graph neural networks    Blockchain datasets are a unique source of alpha for quant models in the crypto space. From a structural perspective, blockchain data is intrinsically hierarchical and is represented by a graph with nodes representing addresses connected by edges representing transactions. Imagine a scenario in which a quant model is trying to predict volatility in bitcoin in a given exchange based on the characteristics of addresses transferring funds into the exchange. That kind of model needs to operate efficiently over hierarchical data. But most machine learning techniques are designed to work with tabular datasets, not graphs.      Graph neural networks (GNNs) are a new deep learning discipline that focuses on models that operate efficiently on graph data structures. GNNs are a relatively new area of deep learning being invented only in 2005. However, GNNs have seen a lot of adoptions from companies like Uber, Google, Microsoft, DeepMind and others.      In our sample scenario, a GNN could use a graph as input representing the flows in and out of exchanges and infer relevant knowledge relevant to its impact on price. In the context of crypto assets, GNNs have the potential of enabling new quant methods based on blockchain datasets.    2) Generative models    One of the limitations of machine learning quant models is the lack of large historical datasets. Suppose that you are trying to build a predictive model for the price of chainlink (LINK) based on its historical trading behavior. While the concept seems appealing, it might prove to be challenging as LINK has a little over a year of historical trading data in exchanges like Coinbase. That small dataset will be insufficient for most deep neural networks to generalize any relevant knowledge.      Generative models are a type of deep learning method specialized in generating synthetic data that matches the distribution of a training dataset. In our scenario, imagine that we train a generative model in the distribution of the link orderbook in Coinbase in order to generate new orders that match the distribution of the real orderbook.      Combining the real dataset and the synthetic one, we can build a large enough dataset to train a sophisticated deep learning model. The concept of generative model is not particularly new but has gotten a lot of traction in recent year with the emergence of popular techniques such as generative adversarial neural networks (GANs), which have become one of the most popular methods in areas such as image classification and have been used with relevant success with time series financial datasets.    3) Semi-supervised learning    Labeled datasets are scarce in the crypto space and that severely limits the type of machine learning (ML) quant models that can be built in real world scenarios. Imagine that we are trying to build an ML model that makes price predictions based on activity of over-the-counter (OTC) desks. To train that model, we would need a large labeled dataset with addresses belonging to OTC desks which is the type of dataset that only a few entities in the crypto market possesses.      Semi-supervised learning is a deep learning technique that focuses on the creation of models that can learn with small labeled datasets and a large volume of unlabeled data. Semi-supervised learning is analogous to a teacher presenting a few concepts to a group of students and leaves the other concepts to homework and self-study.      In our sample scenario, imagine that we train a model with a small set of labeled trades from OTC desks and a large set of unlabeled ones. Our semi-supervised learning model will learn key features from the labeled dataset such as trade size or frequency and will use the unlabeled dataset to expand the training.    4) Representation learning    Feature extraction and selection are a key component of any quant machine learning model and is particularly relevant in problems that are not very well understood such as crypto asset predictions. Imagine that we are trying to build a predictive model for the price of bitcoin based on order book records.      One of the most important aspects of our effort is to determine which attributes or features can act as predictors. Is it the mid-price, the volume or a hundred other factors? The traditional approach is to rely on subject matter experts to handcraft these features but that can become hard to scale and maintain over time.      Representation learning is an area of dep learning focused on automating the learning of solid representations or features in order to build more effective models. Instead of relying on human feature modeling, representation learning tries to extrapolate features directly from unlabeled datasets. In our example, a representation learning method could analyze the order book and identify hundreds of thousands of potential features that can act as predictors for the Bitcoin prices. That level of scaling and automation is impossible to achieve in manual feature engineering.    5) Neural architecture search    The process of creating quant machine learning models remains highly subjective in many aspects. Let’s take the scenario of a model that is trying to forecast the price of Ethereum based on activity in a set of DeFi protocols. Given the nature of the problem, data scientists will have certain preferences about the type of model and architecture to use.      In our scenario, most of those ideas would be based on domain knowledge and subjective opinions about the way the activity in DeFi protocols can impact the price of Ethereum. Given that machine learning is based on building knowledge and knowledge is not a discrete unit, its almost impossible to debate the merits of one method versus another for a given problem.      Neural architecture search (NAS) is one area of deep learning that tries to automate the creation models using machine learning. Sort of using machine learning to create machine learning. Given a target problem and dataset, NAS methods will evaluate hundreds of possible neural network architectures and output the ones with the most promising results.      In our sample scenario, a NAS method can process a dataset that incorporates trades in decentralized exchanges and produce a few models that can potentially predict the price of Ethereum based on those records.    More to come    The methods described above represent some emerging and more developed areas of deep learning that are likely to have an impact in the crypto quant models in the short term. And those are by no stretch the only areas of deep learning crypto quant should pay attention to.      Other deep learning disciplines such as reinforcement learning, self-supervised learning and even transformers are rapidly making inroads in the quant space. Research and experimentation about deep learning techniques applied to quant models is happening everywhere and crypto stands to be a great beneficiary of that wave of innovation.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Jesus Rodriguez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/10/16/five-machine-learning-methods-crypto-traders-should-know-about,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/26db79705de9ad2f1f084b8000ccc015bb7a4dff-1420x946.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The top cryptocurrency by market value fell around 3% in the 30 minutes to 04:30 UTC, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.  The move happened after OKEx announced an indefinite suspension of withdrawals due to one of its private key holders being out of contact with the exchange, reportedly because they are being held by police.

42413308,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl8MGO,1602843384,OKEx Founder Incommunicado While Assisting in Investigation: Report,"A founder of the OKEx cryptocurrency exchange has become unreachable while assisting police in an investigation unrelated to the exchange, according to Chinese news source Caixin.  In a report on Friday, Caixin said it spoke to two individuals close to OKEx who indicated that Mingxing ""Star"" Xu had been ""taken"" by police at least a week ago.  The report isn't clear exactly where this occurred; OKEx has a headquarters in Hong Kong while being officially based in Malta.  The news comes soon after CoinDesk reported earlier on Friday that OKEx has suspended cryptocurrency withdrawals, citing the absence of an unnamed holder of the exchange’s private keys.  While the notice did say the individual is ""cooperating with a public security bureau in investigations,” OKEx CEO and co-founder Jay Hao said on Weibo the issue is over a personal matter and wouldn't affect the business.  Although Caixin's report suggested Xu is the individual linked to the exchange's withdrawal issues, another report from media source Mars Finance later in the day suggested otherwise.  Mars Finance sources said Xu may be being held to help an investigation into the backdoor listing of OK Group in Hong Kong in 2019 and is not related to the exchange's withdrawal issue.  OKEx also said in a statement Xu has not been involved with OKEx for some time and works within the separate entities OK Group and OK Coin.  Mars Finance also said two executives who had been held along with Xu have been released on bail, though it isn't clear which firm they are linked to.  Xu was previously held by police as part of a fraud investigation back in 2018, but was not arrested.  As the OKEx news broke Friday, cryptocurrency prices took a dive, with bitcoin dropping around 3% in half an hour.  Update (13:17 UTC, Oct. 16): This article has been updated with information from Mars Finance and OKEx, and the headline changed.  Correction (17:45 UTC, June 26, 2023): The article has been correct to clarify that Xu's disappearance was due to his assisting authorities with an investigation unrelated to OKEx.

On Thursday, the DoJ unsealed an indictment (filed on Sept. 24) at the U.S. Eastern District Court of Virginia against Xizhi Li, 45, Jianxing Chen, 40, Jiayu Chen, 46, Eric Yong Woo, 43, Jingyuan Li, 47, and Tao Liu, 45.  The DoJ alleges the six individuals were part of an organization that laundered ""millions"" for the Mexican drug cartels using casinos and front companies.  They are also alleged to have used foreign and domestic bank accounts as well as bulk cash smuggling to launder the funds.  Phone applications such as WeChat and WhatsApp are said to have been used by the group to communicate their illicit activity.  One of the six, Tao Liu, is alleged to have attempted to use wire transfers and cryptocurrency to bribe a U.S. Department of State official to create passports for entry into the U.S.  The six face up to 14 charges including conspiracy to commit money laundering, conspiracy to distribute cocaine, attempted identity fraud, and bribery.  Superseding a previous indictment, the latest charges result from an investigation spanning nearly four years.  Law enforcement looked into the relationship between foreign drug trafficking organizations and Asian money laundering networks in the U.S., China, and elsewhere, according to a DoJ press release.  Each of the six now faces a minimum of 10 years imprisonment with a maximum sentence of life behind bars.
