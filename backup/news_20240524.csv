28403292,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=609736,1716591610,"Post-Ethereum ETF Analysis: ETH Price Seeks Bottom As Bulls Eye $5,000 Target","The recent approval of the Ethereum ETF applications by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Thursday has sparked speculation on the next price movements for the market’s second-largest cryptocurrency as the trading launch date approaches. However, significant transfers of Ethereum (ETH) to cryptocurrency exchanges have raised concerns about profit-taking, portfolio rebalancing, and potential market speculation. Sell-Off Amidst Ethereum ETF Greenlight? According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, these developments coincide with Ethereum founder Jeffrey Wilke transferring 10,000 ETH, valued at approximately $37.38 million, to the cryptocurrency exchange Kraken. Furthermore, the surge in Ethereum balances on cryptocurrency exchanges indicates a notable increase in tokens available for sale. Related Reading: Ready For Liftoff: XRP Price Primed To Skyrocket Before November The chart below shows that more than 242,000 ETH have been transferred to cryptocurrency exchange wallets over the past two weeks, signaling increased trading activity that can contribute to price volatility. This trend, coupled with Wilke’s transfer, suggests the possibility of a sell-off or an increase in profit-taking among market participants. While industry experts like Anthony Pompliano view the Ethereum ETF approval as a positive sign for the entire industry, traders are advised to exercise caution. For Martinez, the growing number of ETH deposits to exchange wallets implies a potential market reaction characterized by profit-taking or selling pressure. Additionally, the analyst notes that the Tom DeMark (TD) Sequential indicator has presented a sell signal on Ethereum’s daily chart, indicating the potential for a retracement or a new downward countdown phase before the upward trend resumes. Ethereum’s Price Outlook In Focus Diving into the price analysis, considering the IOMAP (Input-Output Model and Profitability) data, Martinez highlights that Ethereum has a strong demand zone between $3,820 and $3,700, where over 1.81 million addresses bought approximately 1.66 million ETH. This range could provide support amid increasing selling pressure. However, if this zone fails to hold, the next key area of support lies between $3,580 and $3,462, where 3.13 million addresses acquired over 1.50 million ETH. Related Reading: Bitcoin Disappoints With Fall To $67,000, But Analyst Says Investors Should Not Be Fazed. Here’s Why On the upside, Ethereum’s most significant resistance barrier is between $3,940 and $4,054, with over 1.16 million addresses purchasing around 574,660 ETH. Martinez suggests that a daily candlestick close above $4,170 would invalidate the bearish outlook and potentially trigger a new upward countdown phase, with a target towards $5,000. As of this writing, ETH’s price is $3,719, reflecting a 2.5% retracement over the past 24 hours. However, according to the analyst’s assessment, Ethereum remains within a crucial demand zone. As the market approaches the launch and commencement of trading for all eight spot Ethereum ETF applications by the world’s largest asset managers, the exact impact on price action is yet to be fully realized.

This category of investors has accumulated a significant amount of the crypto token in the last seven days amid heightened volatility in Bitcoin’s price. Bitcoin Whales Accumulate $1.4 Worth Of BTC Data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock shows that Bitcoin addresses holding between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC have combined to accumulate 20,000 BTC ($1.4 billion) over the past seven days. This accumulation coincides with Bitcoin’s recent price surge above $70,000. Furthermore, these whales’ purchases suggest that volume is picking up for the flagship crypto, which could help trigger more price rallies. Moreover, on-chain analytics platform Glassnode noted in a recent market report that the selling pressure on Bitcoin was declining. Therefore, Bitcoin’s price looks primed to take off sooner rather than later with significant buys like the one made by these whales. Related Reading: Non-Empty USDC And USDT Wallets See 13.9% And 15.7% Spike, Why This Is Good For Crypto Meanwhile, institutional investors are also back in the fold and look to be doubling their bets on the flagship crypto. This is evident in the fact that inflows into the Spot Bitcoin ETFs have picked up over the last two weeks. Data from Farside Investors shows that these funds have taken in almost $800 million in this week alone. Crypto analyst James Check (also known as Checkmatey) noted in a recent market report that these funds could lead the next wave of demand, driving Bitcoin’s price to a new all-time high (ATH). These Spot Bitcoin ETFs have already been instrumental to Bitcoin’s growth this year, with the flagship crypto hitting its current ATH of $73,750 earlier in March. Like Check, crypto analyst Gustavo Faria also noted in a recent blog post that there are signs that a new wave of demand is emerging. This has raised the possibility of the next rally happening even sooner than expected. Crypto analysts like BitQuant have provided insights into how high Bitcoin could rise on its next leg up, predicting that the crypto token will reach $95,000. No Need To Worry About Price Dips On-chain analytics platform Santiment suggested there was no need to worry about any price correction for Bitcoin as the bulls have enough capital to buy up these dips. The platform highlighted that the amount of non-empty stablecoin wallets is rising, indicating that more whales are loading up their bags to invest in the crypto market. Related Reading: Pundit Predicts Shiba Inu Competitor Dogwifhat Will Reach $10 Amid Short liquidations Specifically, USDC non-empty wallets have grown by over 13%, and Tether non-empty wallets have grown by over 15%.

28399991,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=609708,1716586257,Did MicroStrategy Mess Up By Choosing Bitcoin Over Ethereum? Analyst Weighs In,"Earlier today, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved 19b-4 fillings for eight spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), paving the way for the highly anticipated institutional adoption of the second most valuable coin. The decision comes after months of uncertainty and less than six months after the regulator approved spot Bitcoin ETFs. For all that the crypto community can remember this week, the regulator uncharacteristically “scrambled” and hastily communicated to spot ETF issuers to make amends to their applications. Related Reading: Ready For Liftoff: XRP Price Primed To Skyrocket Before November Did MicroStrategy Make A Mistake Choosing Bitcoin Over Ethereum? With spot Ethereum ETFs likely to be issued in the next few weeks, one analyst on X now thinks Michael Saylor, the former CEO of MicroStrategy, missed big rewards by choosing Bitcoin over Ethereum. As of May 24, MicroStrategy, a business intelligence firm and now one of the biggest public companies in the United States, has been increasing its BTC holdings over the years. According to Bitcoin Treasuries, MicroStrategy is the largest public company holding BTC, controlling 214,400 BTC worth over $14 billion at press time. However, with the United States SEC setting the ball rolling for spot Ethereum ETFs, the analyst is now pointing out a hypothetical scenario. If MicroStrategy had chosen ETH over BTC, their holding would have been worth over $19 billion at spot rates. This level means MicroStrategy would be up over $4 billion. Assuming the business intelligence firm had chosen to buy and not hold but stake, their total holdings would be worth over $20.9 billion as of late May 2024. ETH Trading At A Huge Discount: Will It Replicate BTC’s Success? Looking at the aftermath of the approval and trading of spot Bitcoin ETFs, it becomes apparent that Ethereum prices might be significantly undervalued at spot rates. After a brief dip in mid-January, BTC prices surged, propelling Ethereum to a high of $4,100. In contrast, the world’s most valuable coin soared to breach $70,000 and set all-time highs at around $74,000. With 19b-4 forms from eight ETF issuers, including BlackRock and Fidelity, approved, the only hurdle is the approval of S-1 registration statements. There might be delays in this round. However, the United States SEC green lights, spot Ethereum ETF shares will begin trading. Related Reading: Bitcoin Disappoints With Fall To $67,000, But Analyst Says Investors Should Not Be Fazed.

42418068,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcXTp,1716583725,The Untold Story Behind Beeple's Historic NFT Sale: 'Token Supremacy' Excerpt,"Mike Winkelmann sank into the sofa as three cameras recorded his meltdown. The dueling identities that had once structured his life were coming into conflict as his fortunes increased by the second. Unseen crypto billionaires were bidding for his soul, or at least it felt that way. His entire artistic career was being auctioned as a compilation of five thousand digital artworks, packaged by the Christie’s auctioneers as a single non-fungible token (NFT). The winner would receive this NFT as an online certificate of ownership, a deed to 14 years inside Winkelmann’s mind. It was surreal watching his own coronation from the couch. The new crypto king was slack jawed as his net worth continued to rise by the millions on the computer screen, reckoning with the transformation of his art into an ultimate use-case for blockchain technology, bringing the metaverse into the mainstream. Two documentary crews captured his euphoric stupor, memorializing the tight choreography of this historic moment.  Zachary Small, a New York Times reporter writing about the art world's relationship to money, politics and technology, is the author of ""Token Supremacy: THE ART OF FINANCE, THE FINANCE OF ART, AND THE GREAT CRYPTO CRASH OF 2022,"" published by Penguin Random House.  The artist had become a multimillionaire at that moment. It was too much to bear, and suddenly he was bolting for the out door patio, away from the living room, where his family had gathered to celebrate his success. Winkelmann needed some air.  Once upon a time, the promise of a divided life held some appeal. Mike owned a lucrative business turning digital graphics and animations into branded visuals for clients like Louis Vuitton, Apple and Justin Bieber. The money he earned from those productions allowed him to live in the McMansion suburbs outside of Charleston, South Carolina. He fit comfortably there into the patterns of home, work, and hobby. He was popular with the neighbors, a plucky midwestern transplant with a wide smile, a sailor’s mouth, and a heart of gold. He would sometimes rant about politics, but otherwise focused on family, sitting pretty in a large home overlooking the palmetto trees. Mike understood the value of compartmentalization, because his parents taught him midwestern manners and the importance of staying reserved in the middle-class Wisconsin village where he was born. So he kept his more libidinal thoughts inside a computer running so hot that it needed to be stored in the bathroom on a wood platform over the tub, near a jury-rigged industrial A/C unit that vented its heat into the attic.  The computer expended its vast amounts of energy trying to contain Beeple, the internet crap monster responsible for Winkelmann’s cult online following. He adopted the name in 2003, after a 1980s toy that looked like the abandoned love child of Sasquatch and Chewbacca, with light sensors that triggered its blinking nose and squeaky voice whenever its eyes were covered by a hand. Winkelmann had just graduated with a computer-science degree from Purdue University in Indiana, but he found programming “boring as sh*t.” The 22-year-old was more interested in shooting narrative short films through a webcam than working for a software company. The Beeple toy came to symbolize his fascination with the interplay of light and sound.  In 2007, Beeple started a project that would eventually make him famous. The ""Everydays"" series began as a daily drawing habit of crude little doodles that seemed to betray his more corporate, Bill Gates appearance. The drawings were the crass products of a mind feeding on internet bile (racist caricatures, nude women, penis jokes, political satire) and tutored by magical realism (family portraits, animal studies, Jesus smoking cigarettes, Hillary Clinton wearing gold teeth). A year later, Beeple switched to Cinema4D, an animation software that allowed him to manipulate three-dimensional space. For the kid who spent hours at Toys “R” Us playing a demo of Super Mario 64 on the new Nintendo console, it was a dream come true to create realistic worlds on a computer. But it wasn’t until around 2011 that he started fully utilizing the program to experiment with bright colors and blurry shapes with names like Synthetic Bubblegum Tittufux. Around the same time, Beeple started releasing music videos made with Cinema4D as free source material for creative professionals; the artist understood how popular his creations had become only when, on a family vacation to Hong Kong, he saw one of his works projected outside a Hard Rock Cafe.  A recognizable style finally emerged in 2017, when Beeple fully articulated his fascination with tech dystopias. Importing digital assets from other websites allowed him to createmore detailed scenes in only a couple hours. His imagination exploded with skyscrapers stacked atop cargo containers, Santa Claus clones brawling to the death, and cultists worshipping an original Macintosh computer. Celebrity sightings abound in these nihilistic tales of the future: Donald Trump’s head opens to reveal a burger brain; Mickey Mouse holds a machine gun; and Buzz Lightyear lactates in the park.  See also: Beeple Sold Out. So What?  All that chaos was contained in Winkelmann’s computer, sitting on a desk with its cables running into the bathroom hotbox. His home office was largely undecorated, with beige carpeting, Walmart bookshelves, and two 65-inch screen televisions that played CNN and Fox News on mute throughout the day. He was neither the first artist to adopt lowbrow culture (Marcel Duchamp beat him there by nearly a century when he exhibited a signed urinal in 1917) nor the first to immerse himself in mass media (Andy Warhol and his silkscreens of Marilyn Monroe might like a word). What made Beeple special was his evangelism for digital art, his embodiment of the internet’s tendency toward dark absurdism, and his eagerness to build an economy around it. He had already cultivated a network of nearly two million followers on Instagram, and artist friends were repeatedly bugging him to start releasing NFTs. Why not try something new?  Beeple had everything to gain and nothing to lose. In late October 2020, days before the presidential election, he released three artworks on the NFT marketplace Nifty Gateway. One piece was called ""Politics Is Bullshit,"" featuring a diarrheic bull tattooed with an American flag with a Twitter bird perched upon its neck. The initial offer for this edition of 100 images was just $1.00 each.  “If you need extra convincing from some BS artist’s notes wether you want to spend a dollar on this i will punch you in the god damn face,” Beeple wrote about the offering in the lowercase, typo-ridden idiom of internetspeak. “Smash the buy button ya jabroni.”  Poof. All gone. Sold. The two other NFTs offered, including one from a video series called Crossroads, went for $66,666.66 each. Even with such a devilish price – decided upon with the whimsy of a speculative market willing to spend whatever – Winkelmann could identify his salvation in the metaverse. The most he had ever made from his artworks was $100 for a small print. Now the artist saw a potential avenue for financializing his digital art, one that built upon the lucrative market for online collectibles that companies like Dapper Labs and Larva Labs had started in 2017 with the release of CryptoKitty and CryptoPunk NFTs. Executives behind those products had predicted that digital art would find online buyers, and within the two-month period from November to January 2018, CryptoKitties made $52 million. Mack Flavelle, a founder of the CryptoKitties project, pointed out why: “There’s not that much that people can do with cryptocurrency,” he told the New York Times reporter Scott Reyburn at the time. “We gave them something fun and useful to do with their Ethereum.”  Winkelmann’s success seemed to fulfill the prophecy that individual artists would benefit from the cryptoeconomy. But the business developers behind crypto companies were looking for the kind of legitimization that no amount of advertising could attain, and collectibles by themselves felt like little more than a bubble. They wanted the approval of legacy companies.  They wanted permanence. They wanted cultural capital.  In 2017, Christie’s made a Renaissance painting the marquee lot in their November sale of postwar and contemporary art. The anachronism was supposed to convey the immediacy of the artwork’s appeal, even if art historians were more skeptical about its authenticity; nevertheless, the auction house described Salvator Mundi as a genuine Leonardo da Vinci painting, and it sold for a record $450.3 million to Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman. The price overtook the previous benchmark, set by a Picasso painting in 2015, by almost triple. Gasps from the salesroom confirmed the event as peak spectacle, made even more ridiculous in the coming years, as Salvator Mundi remained locked inside the crown prince’s yacht; he refused to exhibit the painting publicly, allegedly because he feared that museums might downgrade the work as belonging to a Leonardo assistant instead of the master himself.  Restructuring continued in 2020, as Christie’s announced that it would merge its impressionist and modern and contemporary art departments into one office. “Our clients don’t think in categories anymore,” Guillaume Cerutti, chief executive at the auction house, told reporters at the time.  The decision came at a time when impressionist and modern sales were performing far below their postwar and contemporary competitors. Combining the departments would dump collectors into one pool, changing the dynamics of the market and pushing tastes toward the present. It suddenly seemed that the most expensive artworks had paint dripping off the canvas; the artists were oftentimes women and people of color, and they were in their 30s and 40s – shocking for an industry that had exclusively prized dead white men for the majority of its existence. Sales of art sold within three years of its creation date grew 1,000% over the past decade to almost $260 million.  Ironically, the arrival of the ultra-contemporary market occurred around the same time that Christie’s announced that its top lot for the ""20th Century Evening Sale"" in October 2020 would be the remains of a Tyrannosaurus rex, nicknamed Stan, which ended up selling for $31.8 million, the most ever paid for a fossil at the time.  Many employees were bitter about the changes; they rolled their eyes at the little anachronisms that had become headliners. It was a successful marketing gimmick by the bigwigs to grab attention in a moment when the pandemic economy seemed on the verge of daily collapse. Those who joined the auction house to nerd out on art history hated this new approach, but others, with a sense for business, thrived in the controlled chaos.  See also: Robert Alice Made NFT History, Now He's Writing About It  “I have always felt like I am living in the theater of the absurd,” Davis later confided in me. He relished the ridiculous nature of his industry. The auction world was a system of meaningless sales records, an illusion of competition that often boiled down to a handful of rich men who all knew one another competing over the bragging rights of ownership. Connoisseurship was dead. Provenance was a mirage. Dinosaur bones were being sold next to Rothko and Picasso paintings.  “All I know is that I know nothing,” Davis said, adding that the motto was actually a paraphrase of something Socrates once said and a lyric from a song called “Knowledge” by the California punk band Operation Ivy.  So, when the salesman considered all the strange circumstances surrounding him, auctioning an NFT sounded perfectly reasonable. “It will be fun and a little weird,” he predicted. The auction was less than two months away, and everyone supporting the NFT sale had something to prove. Meghan Doyle, a researcher, and Ryoma Ito, the chief marketing officer, started working around the clock, feeling pressure to create the perfect auction. But the most important detail was still missing: what was Beeple going to make? The artist had originally suggested one of his ""Everydays"" to commemorate 14 years of working on the project.  “Cool, but maybe not as epic as it should be,” Doyle said, declining the proposal.  Winkelmann returned with a new idea. “I had hit this perfect milestone in this massive project,” he remembered. “And I had just happened to hit 5,000 days of making art.” Instead of offering a single work, he decided to combine everything he had created over the last fourteen years into a single composite, sold as an NFT.  “He came back to us with a magnum opus,” Doyle said. “With that image in hand, we were able to rally the support that we needed to develop content around the piece and get advertisements in the newspaper. We had a complete story, a complete picture.”  However, Ito found the level of involvement from Christie’s marketing department lacking. Understanding the stakes of this auction for his company, he started trying to make his own luck through outreach with private collectors – “whales,” as they are called in the crypto community. Vignesh Sundaresan was one of the first names on his list.  In January, Sundaresan could be found on the virtual disco floor with a champagne glass floating about the head of his digital avatar. He was partying hard in the metaverse to celebrate his $2.2-million purchase of twenty Beeple NFTs and the opening of a gallery that he had commissioned Web architects to build in the online world of Origin City. Back then, he was operating under a mysterious persona named MetaKovan, which translates from his native Tamil language into “King of Meta.”  Sundaresan was a serial entrepreneur in the crypto industry; he had gained his affinity for decentralized finance after a childhood in the Indian city of Chennai, where he dreamed of becoming the next Steve Jobs. He was born there in 1988, and came of age alongside the World Wide Web, which had been released the following year. Then there were a series of false starts, including the creation of “Bitcoin ATMs,” which enabled users to deposit physical cash and receive crypto, and a trading platform called Lendroid, which blew through its $48 million in funding within two years.  In 2019, Sundaresan started investing heavily in digital properties, buying a digital representation of a diamond-studded Formula One car for an online racing game, NFT artworks and hundreds of acres in the digital real-estate market. A year later, he started using the name MetaKovan, which he describes as his “exosuit” created for “building the metaverse.”  At the virtual party in January, Sundaresan, now 33, unveiled a fund called Metapurse for investing in NFTs. The 20 Beeple artworks that he had purchased were bundled into a single asset called B.20, which was then fractionalized into ten million tokens. Buyers of the tokens were told that this would denote ownership over the metaverse’s first large-scale public art project.  “We were inspired by the idea of not only being able to own historic artwork, like the Mona Lisa, but also being able to own the museum it was displayed in, and then sharing that ownership and experience with the public,” the company said in its newsletter. “Making money with art is fairly simple and not very imaginative. What we want to do is to decentralize and democratize art.”  Ito had been watching Sundaresan for a while; he understood how the crypto millionaire operated and that he had an affinity for the guttural sci-fi fantasies that Beeple was selling. More important, MetaKovan wanted to leverage NFTs as a financial instrument. He was exactly the kind of person who might want to send a message about the power of digital art by spending millions on an image.  Gradually, Sundaresan was coaxed into the process. He had some initial worries about going through the Christie’s “know your customer” process, an anti-money-laundering rule that ensures that companies keep records on the essential facts of their buyers and sellers. He expressed his reservations to Ito, fearing that he would be unmasked as MetaKovan because of the digital identity trail. But, eventually, he came to accept that this was a risk involved in doing business with an established auction house, even if the majority of bidders remain anonymous to the public unless they choose to reveal themselves. He was joined by his cofounder at Metapurse – another Indian crypto investor, Anand Venkateswaran – who played more of a backseat advisory role in the acquisition process.  The marketing juggernaut at Christie’s, which had initially been slow to support the sale, finally kicked into action. Winkelmann’s NFT idea had been rebranded into an event with its own subtitle, like an Avengers movie – ""Everydays: The First 5000 Days."" Doyle was receiving increasing numbers of emails from crypto collectors expressing their interest in placing a bid. The artwork had been published without a price range; instead, the auction house chose to write “estimate unknown,” a cheeky nod to the usual “inquire for estimate” phrase implying that anyone needing to ask was too poor to buy.  “Estimate unknown.” That was the truth. Winkelmann had prepared himself for the NFT to sell for somewhere near $1 million. Ito had the same gut feeling. It wasn’t until a few days before the sale, as reporters started asking if they were prepared to sell for tens of millions, that the team realized something profound was about to happen.  “Noah looked at me and said, ‘We are about to throw a grenade on the art world,’ ” Winkelmann recalled.  Compliance officers and executives at Christie’s were still debating the financial terms of the deal. The original plan was for the house to accept cryptocurrency for the hammer price but require that its own premium fee be paid in dollars; however, sale organizers worried that such an arrangement would discourage crypto whales from participating in the auction.  Success needed to be measured with the company’s longterm goals for growth. Accepting cryptocurrency would invite scrutiny from the press, traditional collectors and government regulators; it could also be a financial risk, depending on the volatile prices of bitcoin {{BTC}} and ether {{ETH}}. What ultimately became clear to decision makers was that nothing about this sale could be half-assed. Big money often requires big leaps of faith.  “A decision was made at the highest levels to take the whole thing in cryptocurrency,” Doyle said. “The amount of cogs in the wheel for that to happen was truly mind-blowing.”  The gamble worked, and the tidal waves of inquiries about the Beeple sale never stopped. Sundaresan had already confirmed his participation in the auction, but what nobody expected was another competitor willing to participate in one of the most furious online bidding wars that the auction house had ever seen.  On February 25, 2021, the auction began with a $100 opening bid. Within eight minutes, the price had reached $1 million.  “I was shocked that our website could handle it,” Doyle said. “I had never seen that happen.”  The auction had already reached the threshold for bidders at which the prospective buyers needed to be cleared financially, often with letters of references from the crypto exchanges supporting their transactions. There were nearly two dozen hopeful buyers at that point, 18 of whom were entirely new to Christie’s. Most were millennials.

His boss, Alex Rotter, head of 20th-and-21st-century art, even took to social media to brag about the sale. He posted a Beeple artwork to his Instagram featuring a superpowered Homer Simpson lobotomizing his son, Bart Simpson, with laser vision.  “Beeple leads the way,” Rotter captioned the image. “It’s all happening.”  This excerpt has been lightly edited.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Zachary Small,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2024/05/24/the-untold-story-behind-beeples-historic-nft-sale-token-supremacy-excerpt,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2fb76c78c69bcb22f049e1f58d9ac3ca1f987a6e-720x406.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42418051,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcXCH,1716582415,"BitGo’s $100M Suit Against Galaxy Digital Can Proceed, Delaware Supreme Court Rules","Cryptocurrency custodian BitGo will get a fresh chance to sue financial services firm Galaxy Digital over the two companies’ failed $1.2 billion merger agreement after Delaware’s Supreme Court reversed an earlier ruling to dismiss BitGo’s lawsuit.  “We believe justice prevailed on appeal, and we are delighted to move forward with this case in the Chancery Court,” said R. Brian Timmons, partner at Los Angeles-based law firm Quinn Emanuel, which is representing BitGo in this case.  BitGo filed suit against Galaxy in August 2022, seeking $100 million in damages and alleging that Galaxy “intentionally” breached its May 2021 merger agreement when it could no longer afford the $1.2 billion price tag after experiencing massive financial losses during the crypto bear market. Galaxy blamed the breakup on BitGo’s failure to provide certain audited financial statements on time and said BitGo’s claims were “without merit.”  Last June, Delaware Chancery Court Vice Chancellor J. Travis Laster ruled that Galaxy had a “valid basis” to pull out of the agreement, because BitGo gave the firm “non-compliant” financial documents.  After BitGo appealed the ruling, the state’s Supreme Court found that the merger agreement’s definition of “financial statements” was ambiguous, and that both parties “have proffered reasonable interpretations” of acceptable documentation, and reversed the ruling.  ""We will continue to vigorously defend ourselves and remain confident in the merits of our position in the case,"" a Galaxy spokesperson told CoinDesk.

42418065,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcXPh,1716580921,The Unintended Consequences of FIT21’s Crypto Market Structure Bill,"There is no doubt that the bipartisan passage of the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) by the House is a monumental development for the U.S. crypto industry, bringing much-needed regulatory clarity within sight. However, despite its good intentions, FIT21 is fundamentally flawed from a market structure perspective and introduces issues that could have far-reaching unintended consequences if not addressed in future Senate negotiations.  Joshua Riezman is deputy general counsel at GSR.  Note: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.  One of the most problematic aspects of the bill is its creation of a bifurcated market for crypto tokens. By distinguishing between ""restricted digital assets” and “digital commodities” in parallel trading markets, the bill sets the stage for a fragmented landscape that is ill-suited for the inherently global and fungible nature of crypto tokens and creates first-of-its-kind compliance complications.  This legislative initiative stems from the long-running debates over U.S. federal securities laws application to crypto tokens and the difference between bitcoin, considered a non-security, and nearly every other token. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) guidance on whether a crypto token is a security has generally been based on whether the associated blockchain project is ""sufficiently decentralized"" and thus not an investment contract ""security"" as defined by the Howey test.  FIT21 attempts to codify this impractical test by dividing regulatory oversight over spot crypto markets between the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and SEC, based on, among other things, the degree of decentralization.  While the bill helpfully appears to clarify that crypto tokens transferred or sold pursuant to an investment contract do not inherently become securities themselves, it unfortunately contradicts itself by nonetheless giving the SEC plenary authority over such investment contract assets where sold to investors (or issued to developers) for the time period before a project reaches decentralized Valhalla. Only tokens airdropped or earned by end-users are initially “digital commodities” subject to CFTC jurisdiction.  Most confoundingly, FIT21 allows for concurrent trading in restricted digital assets and digital commodities for the same token in separate and distinct markets during this period (as shown in the graphic below). It is likely that many projects would never meet the prescriptive definition of decentralization in the bill and therefore trade in disjointed markets in the U.S. indefinitely.  The bill's proposed bifurcated market for restricted and unrestricted digital assets ignores fungibility as a fundamental characteristic of crypto tokens. By creating categories of restricted and unrestricted assets, the bill disrupts this principle, leading to confusion and market fragmentation. This could impair liquidity, complicate transactions and risk management mechanisms such as derivatives, reduce the overall utility of the crypto tokens and ultimately stifle innovation in a nascent industry.  See also: The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act Is a Watershed Moment | Opinion  Implementing such distinctions would likely necessitate technological modifications to crypto tokens to enable buyers to know which type of crypto asset they are receiving such that they may comply with market-specific requirements. Imposing such technological marking on restricted digital assets, even if possible, would create an ""American-only"" crypto market separate from global digital asset markets, reducing the utility and value of every relevant project.  To protect customers and ensure well-functioning U.S. digital asset markets lawmakers must refine the bill to unify spot markets.  As shown in the above graphic, tokens may transition back and forth between the SEC and CFTC markets should decentralized projects re-centralize. The complexity and compliance costs created by such a scheme applied to the many thousands of future crypto tokens is dramatically underestimated and would undermine the credibility and predictability of U.S. financial markets. There are precious few examples of financial products transitioning between SEC and CFTC jurisdiction and it's nearly always a tire fire (e.g., the 2020 transition of KOSPI 200 futures contracts from CFTC jurisdiction to joint CFTC/SEC jurisdiction).  The bill further underestimates the international nature of crypto token markets. Crypto tokens are global assets that trade as the same instrument globally. Attempting to restrict certain assets within the U.S. would likely lead to regulatory arbitrage, where the flowback from international markets would undermine the bill's intent while eroding the competitiveness of the U.S. crypto industry.  Developers and investors outside the U.S. are unlikely to self-impose similar restrictions on restricted digital assets. Therefore, new projects and investors will be incentivized to move development and investment outside of the U.S. to avoid these requirements. This would make it extremely difficult to prevent the U.S. digital commodities market from being flooded with non-U.S. tokens that would have been restricted digital assets had they been ""issued"" in the U.S.  Lastly and ironically, the bill designed to protect U.S. consumers could end up harming them due to poor market structure. The initial CFTC-regulated markets for end users will be full of sellers that generally received tokens for free. This unbalanced market dynamic will most likely lead to depressed prices and increased volatility compared to both the restricted and international markets, with professional arbitrageurs benefiting at the expense of U.S. retail.  See also: Is the House’s FIT21 Bill Really the Legislation That Crypto Needs? | Opinion  This system will further be gamed by insiders and professional investors as arbitrageurs capitalize on disjointed pricing and price jump discontinuities caused by the transition between centralized and decentralized designations. At best U.S. retail markets will be a noisy signal of fundamental value and end-users will be the last to receive institutional liquidity.  While FIT21 is a crucial step towards addressing the regulatory challenges posed by crypto tokens, its current proposed market structure could have unintended consequences. To protect customers and ensure well-functioning U.S. digital asset markets lawmakers must refine the bill to unify spot markets for fungible crypto tokens that are not otherwise securities in a coherent regulatory framework.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Joshua Riezman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/05/24/the-unintended-consequences-of-fit21s-crypto-market-structure-bill,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/adec6868271ad8036fd6ae22cf65b27f6930025f-1852x1042.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
28396695,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=609698,1716580854,"Battle Of Networks? Algorand Pokes Fun At Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Solana In New Ad","Algorand Foundation’s new ad criticized Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana for their efficiency. The ad received mixed reactions from the crypto community and sparked a conversation about the art of advertising crypto products. Related Reading: Ethereum Eyes $4,000 Comeback Fueled By Bullish Buying Spree Algorand, The Only One “Delivering” Algorand’s latest ad has sparked controversy for “dissing” three networks. Titled “When Blockchain Meets The Real World, Only One Can Deliver,” the ad features a classic grocery store checkout line format. The video shows three customers trying to pay for groceries with crypto: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. During the ad, the three shoppers have problems with their respective transactions, seemingly suggesting that the rival networks are unsuitable for everyday use. The customer using Bitcoin had to wait 27 minutes for the transaction to be completed; the one paying with Ethereum was told the transaction fees were $112, and the Solana payer had his transactions repeatedly failing. All three issues in the ad are common criticisms that the three targeted networks receive. The commercial then shows the next checkout line, with buyers using Algorand as a payment method. As this line moves quickly, the video displays text stating “Instant Finality. Low Fees. Designed for the speed of life.” The ad finished with the cashier saying, “Should have shopped with Algorand,” and Anthony Scaramucci, investment guru and founder of SkyBridge, asking how to get in the fast-moving line. The Crypto Ads Conundrum The video received mixed reviews from the crypto community. Many applauded the ad, stating that Algorand is the future of Layer-1 and payments. One X user said: I can’t stress enough how much the Algorand Foundation does compared to others. All the meetings, tweets, events, etc…this isn’t happening on other chains! However, the negative responses didn’t take long to follow. Several community members considered the jab at other chains an unnecessary and “embarrassing” attack. A user jokingly claimed that Algorand achieved an “impossible goal” with the ad: “uniting all the factions of crypto to dunk on you.” Crypto commentator Zach Rynes considers that this type of marketing doesn’t make sense as he is unsure who it appeals to. In an X post, Rynes explained that the ad would leave the wrong impression on non-crypto people. To him, the video will make the public think that “crypto sucks,” not knowing that the ad is for crypto. The commentator believes it’s a “lose-lose either way” since “Crypto-native people will see this as unnecessarily combative.” Similarly, Mert, CEO of Helius Labs, brought up a point repeated by several community members. Mert criticized Algorand for spending money on an ad when its “top two explorers [are] going out of business due to no funding.” Moreover, he seems to consider the jab at other networks ironic when Algorand’s got its “entire economic security flipped by two dog coins on Solana (WIF + BONK).” Cardano Joins The Advertisement Conversation Despite the criticism, the discussion also sparked interest in the ADA community. X account ADA Whale praised the commercial for being funny. Another community member tagged Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson in the video, suggesting he should start looking for a marketing team to promote Cardano. The user cited the US government’s U-turn, possibly bringing regulatory clarity, as a decisive factor. This is not the first time Cardano has received criticism over its marketing approach. In March, the conversation sparked when the “Cardano Girls” video became viral. Content creator Lily Brodi suggested that despite having the technology aspect figured out, Cardano has an “unattractiveness problem.” This problem prevents a broader audience from entering its community and adopting the technology.

42418062,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcXMb,1716577199,3 Questions About the SEC’s Abrupt ETH ETF Approval,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) confirmed yesterday it has approved critical rule changes to allow for exchange-traded funds holding Ethereum’s native token, ETH. A lot of people were caught off guard, considering that just last week nearly everyone – from Bloomberg analysts to prediction markets – thought it was a lost cause.  Note: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.  It never really made sense to me why SEC Chairman Gary Gensler would hold out on approving these spot ETH products, considering how the agency was embarrassed during its proactive fight over listing bitcoin ETFs.  Recall that a three-person panel of judges in an appeals court called the SEC’s reasoning for denying (and denying and denying) spot bitcoin funds “arbitrary and capricious,” as it had already approved bitcoin futures products that did substantially the same thing. The same situation has been true for ETH as well, and it’s likely that some firm would have been happy to litigate the matter in the same way Digital Currency Group went to bat for bitcoin ETFs.  This time around, the SEC’s decision seems just as arbitrary, just in the opposite direction. In an interview with CoinDesk’s Jesse Hamilton hours before the approval became public, Gensler said he’d follow “how the courts interpret the law” and that the “DC Circuit took a different view, and we took that into consideration and pivoted.”  See also: Ether ETFs Clear Major Hurdle, Though SEC Hasn't Cleared Them for Trading Yet  So why now? What does it mean for Ethereum going forward? And does this bode well for other cryptos?  Was the decision politically motivated?  As many have already noted, it appears there has been a seachange regarding crypto’s regulatory situation. On Thursday, the House took a historic vote to approve the most substantive piece of crypto-specific legislation to date. This came on the heels of both the upper and lower houses of Congress voting to repeal a controversial SEC crypto custody accounting rule.  With significant participation from Democrats in both bills, it appears that the U.S. government’s long war on crypto is nearing an end. Notably, President Biden announced that he wouldn’t veto the crypto market structure bill, FIT21, which the White House officially opposes – a pretty major concession.  It’s possible that all these events on the Hill acted like a temperature check, and helped convince Gensler that his approach to crypto was becoming a political hazard. Afterall, former President Donald Trump did just announce his support for crypto in a big way – and denying ETH ETFs on the basis, purportedly, that the SEC wasn’t having “productive” meetings with applicants would be great ammunition.  To be sure, the SEC didn’t approve ETH ETFs to actually list anytime soon – just the Cboe, NYSE Arca and Nasdaq’s 19b-4 proposals, which would allow them to list the funds once firms like Ark Invest, Bitwise, BlackRock, Fidelity and Grayscale, among others, get their S-1 filings approved. That could take months.  What does it mean for Ethereum?  Well first off, the launch of spot ETH funds means that there may soon be a lot more institutional interest in the second largest cryptocurrency. Not only did the move act as a sort of stamp of approval, it will also create a familiar on-ramp for buying the asset for anyone from mom and pop investors looking to diversify their 401(k)s to hedge funds, much in the same way ETFs did for bitcoin.  “A lot of people have been caught offside by the Ethereum ETF announcement. Even though the Bitcoin ETF created a crypto ETF roadmap for wirehouses and large registered investment advisors, I still expect that many institutional stakeholders are now scrambling to prime their sales teams on the state of Ethereum and put together the proper infrastructure,” Framework Ventures co-founder Michael Anderson said in an emailed statement.  And while ETFs are really just a vehicle for gaining exposure to an underlying asset, it is also possible that these funds will actually drive more users onto Ethereum itself. One scenario: because the SEC likely won’t allow fund managers to stake the underlying ETH, it’s possible new ether investors determine that they want to do it themselves to earn that extra ~3.5% yield.  Relatedly, as Variant Chief Legal Officer Jake Chervinsky noted on X, the approval likely answers one lingering question: whether or not ETH is a security. Chervinsky said, if these funds are allowed to trade, it would likely mean that unstaked ETH, in particular, isn’t viewed as a security at the agency. That in itself may spur more institutions into the market, considering that many are currently holding off simply due to regulatory uncertainty.  On a more technical level, there are many open questions about what it would mean for Ethereum in a world where these funds buy up vast quantities of ETH (assuming they’re as popular) as the bitcoin ETFs. To some degree, the buying pressure would be great for the network and surrounding layer 2s.  Ethereum instituted a burn mechanism that destroys tokens with every transaction, which for a long time made the asset class deflationary. But, with the growing popularity of L2s and alternative chains like Solana, Ethereum transaction volumes have dropped to such a degree that the supply of ETH is growing again, which raises long term implications for the asset’s price and demand. The ETFs could help support the economics of ETH.  See also: Ethereum ETF Approval Could Spur 60% ETH Rally as  Finally, it will be interesting to see how the funds affect the staking economy. Some people have been ringing alarm bells about the amount of staked ETH, now that applications like Lido make it very easy for people to lock up even tiny quantities of the crypto. With the possibility ETFs pull even more ETH out of circulation, these concerns may be compounded.  What does this mean for chains like Solana?  As mentioned, the approval of ETH ETFs is something of an endorsement for Ethereum, and likely an opportunity for the chain to lock in its already dominant brand position.  “Assuming the Ethereum ETF sees even a fraction of the institutional flows that the Bitcoin ETF saw, I think it's entirely possible that Ethereum will be solidified as the uncontested leader in decentralized app platforms for the next several years, at least in terms of market share and valuation,” Anderson said.  But the move may also open the door for alternative chains like Cardano, Solana and Ripple to also enter further into the world of high finance. Of course, bitcoin and ETH had an easier time (all in perspective) because financial incumbents like CME had already embraced them. Ether futures have been live on CME for three years already, while it’s not even clear whether other crypto assets are being considered.  It’s also worth noting that, while the SEC has hinted it thinks ETH is a security, the agency has proactively come out and said that assets like SOL, ADA and ALGO fit the definition outlined by the Howey Test used to determine whether something is an investment contract. This may be a speed-bump in the road towards a spot SOL ETF.",NEUTRAL,ETH | SOL,BTC | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION | SOL,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/05/24/3-questions-about-the-secs-abrupt-eth-etf-approval,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e8944950650417b969fcb88e4ae51326f23bf5d9-3200x1800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

28393418,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=609649,1716575457,Analyst Says Ethereum Spot ETFs Approval Will See “Animal Spirits” Reignite Crypto – What This Means,"A crypto analyst has made a rather cryptic prediction, suggesting that the approval of Ethereum Spot ETFs by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could unleash a new wave of “animal spirits.” This term in crypto is often used to describe an irrational exuberance and optimism that fuels financial markets. Ethereum Spot ETF To Reignite Animal Spirits In an X (formerly Twitter) post on May 22, a crypto analyst identified as “the DeFi Villain,” made a bold forecast, anticipating the resurgence of the bull run altcoin season following the SEC’s approval of Ethereum Spot ETF. The analyst revealed that the approval could let loose “animal spirits,” driving renewed demand and positive sentiment in the market and possibly resulting in a bull market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Drop Below $70,000 Apparently Driven By Lack Of Interest, Glassnode Data Shows The analyst outlined a long list of altcoins that outperformed and experienced remarkable rallies in 2021. These rallies propelled each of their market capitalizations from mere hundreds of millions to billions in the span of a few days and months. Among the cryptocurrencies highlighted by DeFi Villain, some notable altcoins recorded a massive rise in market capitalization, including Dogecoin (DOGE), THORChain (RUNE), Filecoin (FIL), Binance Coin (BNB), Axie Infinity (AXS), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and others. According to the crypto analyst, Dogecoin witnessed a 10x increase in one day, in January 2021. While RUNE market capitalization surged from $200 million to $5 billion in just five months. One of the most remarkable increases was seen in Filecoin which almost reached the current market capitalization of Ethereum. The cryptocurrency had jumped close to a whopping $400 billion during the altcoin bull run in 2021. Other cryptocurrencies like AXS surged from a market capitalization of $200 million to $10 billion, with its Fully Diluted Value (FDV) topping $43 billion at some point. Additionally, Binance Coin, which was already worth $6 billion in early 2021 and among the top 20 cryptocurrencies, had witnessed a mega 8x pump in 20 days, reaching a staggering $50 billion in February 2021. Even popular meme coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) had rallied hard, jumping from $4 billion to $40 billion in less than a month. Ethereum Cash (ETC) also saw its market capitalization rise from $600 million to $17 billion in five months. These massive surges during the 2021 bull run underscore the potential altcoins have on the crypto market and how insane they can surge once the altcoin season hits and the dominance for Bitcoin shifts to lesser cryptocurrencies. DeFi Villain has predicted that the final leg for meme coins is likely going to be “Vertical and Brutal,” suggesting that these volatile cryptocurrencies could have another powerful rally to new highs this market cycle. ETF Approval Nullifies SEC’s Previous Security Claims? Over the past few months, the US SEC has made claims implying that Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency, was considered a security. However following the authorization of Ethereum Spot ETFs, the SEC has finally recognized Ethereum as a non-security. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts An “Ultra Bull” Scenario For Bitcoin That Could Send Price To $80,000 Calling the regulator out on this contradiction, Paul Grewal, Chief Legal Officer (CLO) of Coinbase disclosed that if Ethereum which lacks “contractual agreement or undertaking,” is no longer considered a security by the SEC, then Bitcoin (BTC), which operates similarly without the above agreements, should also be a non-security. Grewal posed a compelling question regarding the classification of 12 other cryptocurrencies, which can be compared to Ethereum and Bitcoin in terms of their non-security treatment by the SEC. The Coinbase CLO disclosed that the implications that these 12 other cryptocurrencies are considered securities despite also lacking contractual agreement or undertaking raises the question about the SEC’s possible lack of regulatory clarity and inconsistent regulatory approach to different crypto assets.

The aim of the partnership is ""monetizing underutilized energy across Kenya and jointly developing technology projects,"" Marathon chief executive officer Fred Thiel said.  In a social media post, the company said that the investment will be in green data centers. Marathon also noted in a press release that the capital will include foreign investments without specifying sources of funds. ""With projected foreign investments expected to exceed $80 million, this venture is poised to deliver economic benefits to the Kenyan economy and generate revenue for the local energy sector ecosystem,"" according to the statement.  The partnership comes as Marathon held talks earlier this month with the nation to help manage its renewable energy operation and advise on its digital asset regulatory regime.  Read more: Bitcoin Miner Marathon In Talks With Kenya to Help With Its Green Energy Ambitions  Renewable energy is Kenya's main power source, responsible for 80% of all electricity generation in 2022, with plans to increase its share to 100% by the end of the decade. However, renewable energy sources like solar and wind are intermittent, meaning that they don't produce energy when most of the consumption happens. Infrastructure building for renewable energy is capital-intensive and requires a power management system to store and distribute energy properly.  Under the agreement, Marathon and Kenyan policymakers will cooperate to ""better understand how to optimize renewable energy projects that produce surplus energy due to intermittency and seasonal variations,"" the press release said.

28389983,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=609629,1716570056,"Shiba Inu One Of The Most-Traded Tokens By Whales, Data Shows","On-chain data suggests that large investors have been showing interest in Shiba Inu recently as they have been moving a high number of SHIB transfers. Shiba Inu Large Transactions Have Been High In Number Recently As pointed out by an analyst in an X post using data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, the Shiba Inu whales have been on the move over the past month. The on-chain indicator of interest here is the “Number of Large Transactions,” which tracks the total number of transfers on any cryptocurrency network exceeding $100,000 in value. Generally, only the whale entities are capable of making such large transfers, so the Number of Large Transactions may be considered to reflect the activity of these giants. Related Reading: Analyst Says “Only A Matter Of Time” Before Bitcoin Flies Past ATH When the value of this metric is high, it means that the asset is observing a large number of large moves currently. Such a trend may be a sign that the whales are actively interested in cryptocurrency right now. On the other hand, the indicator being low could suggest the whales are looking at other markets at the moment as they aren’t making many transactions for the asset. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in this indicator for Shiba Inu over the last month or so: As the above graph shows, the number of large transactions for Shiba Inu has shown relatively high values at different points in the past month and has also appeared to be climbing during the last few days. The lower chart shows the data for another metric, the “Large Transactions Volume.” This indicator measures the total volume of transactions greater than $100,000 combined moving on the network every day. It would appear that while the number of transfers happening on the network right now is similar to that seen during the spike earlier in the month, the volume back then was notably larger. This would naturally suggest that the whale transfers currently taking place aren’t of the same scale. Nonetheless, the metric isn’t at particularly low levels, either. “Large whale transactions have amassed around 30 trillion SHIB in May, making Shiba Inu one of the most traded tokens by whales so far this month,” notes the analyst. Related Reading: Is $77,600 The Next Step For Bitcoin? On-Chain Pricing Model Hints So Now, what does this high whale activity mean for the memecoin’s price? Since these indicators don’t differentiate between buying or selling transactions, it’s hard to say anything about where the coin might go based on them alone. One thing, however, that’s usually true is that whales being active can induce higher volatility in the price. As such, Shiba Inu may be more likely to witness sharper price action if these humongous entities continue to make moves. SHIB Price At the time of writing, Shiba Inu is floating around $0.0000241, down more than 2.5% over the last seven days.

42418060,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcXJV,1716567847,Crypto Governance Advisory MetaLeX Raises $2.75M,"Prominent crypto lawyer Gabriel Shapiro's MetaLeX raised $2.75 million at a $27.5 million valuation.  The project is building new governance standards for crypto groups to use when decentralizing.  Crypto proponents used to posit that ""code is law."" Courts and legal pundits ultimately forced the phrase into retirement. But there's still plenty of money in figuring out how the two intertwine.  One such effort is crypto lawyer Gabriel Shapiro's MetaLeX, a hybrid law firm/tech company focused on the mess that crypto projects make when trying to ""decentralize."" MetaLeX recently raised $2.75 million in seed funding led by Cyber Fund. It is now valued at $27.5 million, Shapiro said.  Unlike their ""centralized"" counterparts in the traditional business world, many crypto projects seek to ""decentralize"" by giving their tokenholders control of budgets and other core operations. It's a costly, cumbersome, failure-prone journey that has bedeviled major DeFi players like SushiSwap and often leaves the organization open to make arbitrary decisions that break their own ethos.  Into this fray steps Shapiro's incredibly niche MetaLeX. In an interview with CoinDesk, he described it as a ""business-to-business, crypto software as a services"" company that's designing standardized, smart contract-based processes for so-called decentralized autonomous organizations, or DAOs, to properly run themselves on-chain.  In MetaLeX lingo, the name for this newfangled construct is a Cybernetic Organization, or BORG. Think of it as a cyborg equivalent for legal entities. They'll be governed by hard-coded, smart contract-enforced rules infused into their charters, according to the project whitepaper.  ""What makes them kind of unique is the way they mandate smart contract functionality"" in their operations,"" Shapiro said. ""That makes them 'cybernetic.'""  MetaLeX's first product will be an operating system for DAOs to BORGify their governance decision processes with constructs to run grantmaking, emergency shutdowns and venture investments made on behalf of the entity, he said.  Crypto projects are reaching out ""every day"" to join the waitlist for MetaLeX OS, Shapiro said, including two ""blue chip"" projects, though he declined to identify them beyond saying they were a layer-2 blockchain and a ""traditional DeFi DAO.""  'Fully BORGify'  ""They both want to fully BORGify their operations,"" he said.  Not every crypto project can be easily BORGified. Those that have already launched tokens and DAO governance processes are more difficult to work with than pre-token projects, Shapiro said.  MetaLeX is not itself a BORG or a DAO or anything that crypto-native. It's an umbrella brand for a Delaware corporation (the tech company) and a Texas limited liability partnership (the law firm led by Shapiro and Alex Golubitsky). Clients could use one or both, Shapiro said.  MetaLeX could one day have its own token if it evolves to become a legal protocol that requires governance by its customers, Shapiro said.  ""It will probably take a while before we would get to that point. But ultimately I think it will get there,"" he said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/05/24/crypto-governance-advisory-metalex-raises-275m,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/37b99762cb7cb88dc8a495219a8ed23783b76abd-734x413.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42418064,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcXNd,1716566125,Coinbase Slugs It Out With U.S. SEC in Effort to Get Key Crypto Question Answered,"Coinbase is trying to get a higher court to take a look at a question at the heart of its legal dispute with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The courts must accept the request for appeal before it can move forward, but the SEC has said the exchange hasn't made its case.  Coinbase Inc. (COIN) took another step in its back-and-forth argument with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on whether the cryptocurrency exchange should be allowed to raise a single, core legal point for consideration by a higher court.  After the company's effort to dismiss the SEC's enforcement case against it was rejected in federal court, Coinbase lawyers on Friday filed for a so-called interlocutory appeal that seeks to get one question considered at the next level up: Is a digital asset transaction that poses no obligation to the original issuer of the asset an investment contract regulated by the SEC?  Coinbase's filing described the query as ""a novel legal question in a regulatory action against a market leader that could shape or distort a multi-trillion-dollar industry.""  The exchange said ""no appellate court has addressed whether a digital asset transaction carrying no post-sale obligations can be an 'investment contract'"" under the Howey Test that's the legal standard for determining what assets are securities. Coinbase also argued that the SEC is acting inconsistently, because it pursued a similar appeal in its case against Ripple.  Coinbase had requested this appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit last month, and the SEC argued on May 10 that the court already ""noted the lack of any legal authority for Coinbase’s various arguments,"" contending that ""there can be no doubt"" that the latest request to be allowed to appeal also fails to establish such legal grounds and should be halted.  The request would have to be accepted by the courts, including Judge Katherine Polk Failla, of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, who rejected Coinbase's request to dismiss the SEC's original case, which accused the exchange of operating illegally. Resolving this central legal question could help steer a number of other SEC enforcement clashes with the industry.

The protocol's native token has been up 41% in the past week.  Ether.fi's CEO said that a spot ETF approval will help shift narratives around Ethereum and smart contracts.  Restaking protocol Ether.fi has soared to record highs in terms of deposits and total value locked (TVL) as investors anticipate the approval of a spot ether {{ETH}} exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the U.S.  More than 270,000 ether ($995 million) has been deposited to Ether.fi over the past ten days. The inflows, coupled with ether's recent rise in price, have spurred the protocol's with TVL to increase from $4 billion to $5.4 billion, an all-time high according to DefiLlama.  Restaking is a strategy used by traders to earn an extra yield on ether that is already staked on the Ethereum blockchain. Ether.fi currently offers an annual yield of 3.48%, with an additional 15.1% being available through the product's liquid vault.  The increase in activity could suggest that investors are looking to gain exposure to the Ethereum ecosystem while betting on whether staking could be incorporated into ETF products in the future.  Ether.fi's CEO Mike Silagadze, told CoinDesk that it will be a ""matter of time"" before ether ETFs begin to implement staking and restaking to generate a yield for shareholders.  ""I think there is question whether staking, particularly liquid staking, turns ETH into a security,"" Silagadze said. ""I think how it is going to start is you will have ETH ETFs that are either contracted out or run their own infrastructure, those nodes will be compliant and censored and all of that stuff, but it'll have a nice baked-in yield. Restaking is much more complex, so I think it'll get there; it'll just be a matter of time.""  Silagadze added that the SEC's approval will help shift the narrative as more people become aware of Ethereum and smart contracts.  ""It's just more awareness,"" Silagadze said. ""A lot of people that are sophisticated know what restaking is; they just have no way to access it or allocate to this asset. So I think it helps with the narrative shift because more people become aware of what Ethereum is.""

However, given the impact of the exchange funds, as seen with Bitcoin, several crypto analysts and market watchers anticipate a major rally for ETH in the upcoming months. Joining the fray is popular cryptocurrency expert and trader Javon Marks, who has spotlighted a noteworthy breakout in the price action of Ethereum, speculating that the development may trigger a notable rally for the crypto asset. Ethereum Breakout Signal New All-Time Highs Marks’s prediction emphasizes the possibility that ETH could reach unprecedented price levels after the emergence of several distinct Bullish Metrics. He noted that shortly after exhibiting multiple distinct bullish metrics, ETH’s prices confirmed a major breakout. Due to this, a significant move in the upward trajectory could be underway. Related Reading: Ethereum Rally Looms: Analyst Predicts ETH’s Next Stop Is $5,300 Earlier this month, Marks pointed out about four bullish metrics in the price of Ethereum. These include a Bull Flag-like price structure, Higher Lows in price action, Lower Lows in the Relative Strength Index (RSI), and Larger Upside price breakout to the $4,811 price mark. Sharing insights on the Bull Flag-like pattern, Javon Marks claims a breakout could result in new all-time highs for ETH, and for the benefit of many Altcoins. However, a few days later, the analyst reported that Ethereum was getting close to the Bull Flag pattern’s breakout levels. Should a successful breakout take place, it will only kickstart the next stage of substantial growth. Specifically, in the event of a breakout, the price of ETH might rise by about +50% from the level then, to $4,811. Furthermore, it might potentially result in prices topping at $5,000 and setting new peaks. Meanwhile, less than 2 hours later the expert confirms the asset has broken out of the pattern at lightspeed and is surging in the upward direction. Thus following this breakout, ETH’s prices may be poised for another 23.4% from the current level to the aforementioned price targets, while suggesting that further growth could be on the horizon. ETH Sees Bearish Movement Currently, the digital asset is seeing a bearish movement after failing to break above the $4,000 mark once again. Even though the entire crypto market is experiencing a bearish momentum, a good recovery is still expected to happen soon. Related Reading: When Spot Ethereum ETFs Go Live ‘Expect A Bloodbath’, Says Expert Despite the approval of ETH spot ETFs, the coin has recorded a decline of over 5% in the last 24 hours.

42418058,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcXHR,1716561700,"Yes, PR Does Still Matter in Blockchain, Despite Balaji’s Advice","To a startup founder working with a PR agency for the first time, the immediate impacts of a resonant campaign or an extended engagement might not seem clear. This seems especially true when notable influencers and entrepreneurs such as Balaji Srinivasan tell founders rather bluntly to “hire creators, not public relators”.  This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's Web3 Marketing Week.  Motti Peer is chairman and co-CEO of ReBlonde, a Web3 marketing and PR firm. Note: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.  Srinivasan’s rationale here builds on Tesla’s strategy of dissolving its PR department in 2020 – an unusual move that the company has recently walked back on – further punctuating the frequently unpredictable or erratic behavior of its CEO Elon Musk.  While it might make sense for company leaders to make their communications more direct, that doesn’t necessarily mean they should sideline PR as an antiquated tool. As a PR veteran with decades of experience helping companies navigate every kind of success and setback – I’ve witnessed how the expectations around public relations have shifted radically throughout the years.  This is especially true in the blockchain arena, where leaders are still getting their feet wet in the communications space and may end up unwittingly jeopardizing the future of their project by ignoring the virtues and value of a communications plan.  Direct communication pitfalls  Srinivasan echoes many talking points that have been leveled at public relations as an industry for years: It’s a relic of the past, cedes too much narrative control to journalists and doesn’t directly contribute to conversion like direct marketing can. His proposed alternative is to take a company-aligned, content-creator-focused approach that forgoes media – or implementing AI to do it – and advises only hiring PR professionals who have rebranded to “creators” with built-in audiences themselves.  Let’s be clear: PR and SEO or marketing are not the same thing. Although they fall under the wider “communications” umbrella, it’s wrong to assume that their strategies, KPIs or added value are interchangeable. It also completely misconstrues what PR professionals do by ascribing their only value to sending out press releases.  Yes, content is king in any kind of modern communication. But while PR professionals also function as content creators, not all content creators can enter the PR arena.  It’s also true that although the media and individual reporters may be friendly – they are not your friends nor part of a company’s marketing and social media team. A project trying to garner consistent media coverage will never do so by posting TikToks or X threads.  PR operates in earned media – leveraging company announcements, iron-clad relations with media outlets and reporters, thought leaderships and other content-focused strategies to garner results without needing to pay for it. The idea that PR professionals are “giving precious content away for free” to journalists greatly mischaracterizes what PR content is for.  There’s also a fine line between alerting the media about an exciting announcement or development and spamming your audience with news that is not really news. PR professionals can advise on what information to share and add value to an announcement that rewards your efforts in coverage that truly resonates with key audiences and stakeholders.  Stronger together  Just because blockchain and crypto are ingrained in internet culture and social media communication doesn’t make traditional PR obsolete. It just requires a bit of a twist that only a team of experienced communications professionals can provide.  Pay-to-play placements or paid social content creation will never stack up or achieve the same results as earned media. And any agency, communications team, or freelance publicist purporting that it can be equated is misguided.  Simply put: Users have an allergy to paid media. It’s why most people install ad-blocking extensions on their web browser or pay extra for ad-free streaming on Spotify or Netflix. We live in a world bombarded with ads and sponsored content vying for clicks across social media and virtually any other platform. So, unless an ad or influencer campaign is particularly memorable, we naturally develop a blindness to it.  That very concretely translates to media consumption. You likely don’t remember the last ten advertisements or sponsored posts you saw on TikTok, but you do remember a thought-provoking article about an interesting company or a podcast with an incisive founder on your daily commute.  See also: How Web3 Marketing Changes the Game | Opinion  Social media is a fickle thing, and just because a creator or company leader might have an audience doesn’t necessarily mean your project will sustainably gain the same resonance.  Likewise, focusing solely on content creators to lead “public relations” efforts won’t help too much in a crisis or controversy, two things that blockchain companies and founders, unfortunately, find themselves prone to. No investor wants to learn about a disappointing quarter from an X post, and no employee wants to hear about impending layoffs from a TikTok.  By all means, projects should have an SEO and marketing plan to boost conversion and lead generation, but it cannot substitute the hard work of earned PR or downplay its results.  All of these fields come with singular approaches with unique drawbacks, advantages, and expectations. There might be some overlap, but ultimately, the ROI in PR comes from establishing and maintaining a timeless and respected brand – not affiliate link clicks or snarky, ephemeral creator posts.  Founders and leaders of startups pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in tech should be wary of these differences, and of any organization that claims to either guarantee coverage or manufacture results that don’t reflect the reality of a company’s standing.  Otherwise, flattening a communications strategy to solely focus on social media or quick wins and generally meaningless metrics risks upending the hard work and dedication of a team trying to make innovation a reality.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | SPONSORED,Motti Peer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/05/24/yes-pr-does-still-matter-in-blockchain-despite-balajis-advice,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/095e7966222beab18cc2251622acf78653b0ce76-1600x876.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This won’t likely happen until 2025, analyst Geoffrey Kendric wrote in a note.  With the approval of an important filing in the race to launch a spot ether {{ETH}} exchange-traded fund (ETF), industry leaders are already wondering which cryptocurrency could be next.  Standard Chartered (STAN) said it believes Solana {{SOL}} or Ripple’s XRP could be the next contenders, but not until 2025.  “For other coins (eg. SOL, XRP), markets will look ahead to their eventual ETF status as well, albeit this is likely a 2025 story, not a 2024 one,” analyst Geoffrey Kendric said. “For now, bitcoin and ether dominance will rise, with selective “next in line” winners as well.”  The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Thursday approved forms 19b-4 filed by would-be issuers. While this is an important step in the race to launch a spot ether ETF, it is only one of two forms that needs approval from the regulator.  It could take the SEC weeks if not months – even potentially indefinitely – to approve the S-1 document, which has so far only been filed by a few potential issuers.  Several industry experts have suggested that SOL would be a logical choice for a third ETF, given its similarities to Ethereum.  Brokerage firm Bernstein said in a note on Thursday that given Ethereum’s classification as a commodity, the token could follow a similar path. Solana is the third biggest cryptocurrency after bitcoin and ether by market cap. This is excluding stablecoin Tether (USDT) and Binance Coin {{BNB}}.

Here’s Why","Bitcoin has dropped from its weekly high of $71,980, recorded on May 21, to as low as $67,000, raising concerns amongst crypto investors. However, crypto analyst Jelle has suggested that there is no need to be worried about the flagship crypto’s price action. Why Investors Shouldn’t Be Worried About The Bitcoin Price Jelle noted in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Bitcoin is still following a “similar path” to the 2017 bull run. He claimed that once the crypto token breaks again above the 2021 all-time high ($69,000), it will make a parabolic move to the upside. Jelle predicts that Bitcoin could reach $100,000 when that happens. Related Reading: Pundit Predicts Shiba Inu Competitor Dogwifhat Will Reach $10 Amid Short liquidations In an earlier X post, Jelle provided insights into why Bitcoin could easily make such a move. He revealed that all key resistance levels have been broken. He also noted that a weekly hidden bullish divergence had formed on Bitcoin’s chart, just on top of the previous cycle highs. Meanwhile, crypto trader and analyst Mags also echoed Jelle’s bullish sentiment. In an X post, he mentioned that this recent price correction was the “fakeout before the next leg up.” Mags noted how Bitcoin has maintained a similar pattern since its price bottomed at $15,000, with the flagship crypto consolidating inside a range for “a few weeks or months.” Mags claims that Bitcoin then breaks below the range where it traps all bears before making a “quick reclaim and another leg up.” The analyst added that there is going to be a “massive leg up soon” if Bitcoin manages to repeat this pattern. Crypto analyst BitQuant also assured there was no need to panic about Bitcoin’s recent dip. In an X post, he claimed that the price dip was a “good confirmation” that Bitcoin is preparing for a “big leg up.” The crypto analyst predicts that the flagship crypto will rise to as high as $95,000 when this parabolic move happens. BTC’s Outlook Is Bullish Either Way Crypto analyst Rekt Capital suggested that Bitcoin’s outlook is bullish regardless of what happens. He outlined two possible moves the flagship crypto could make from here. First, he stated that a weekly candle close above $71,500 would likely kickstart the breakout from the Re-Accumulation Range. Related Reading: Non-Empty USDC And USDT Wallets See 13.9% And 15.7% Spike, Why This Is Good For Crypto On the other hand, he noted that history suggests that Bitcoin will consolidate inside this Re-Accumulation Range for some weeks more. Based on his analysis, Bitcoin is still bound to make significant moves to the upside, and all that matters is the timing. The analyst noted that a breakout now could mean Bitcoin would have an accelerated cycle. However, if Bitcoin continues to consolidate for some more weeks, that will help it resynchronize with past halving cycles, resulting in a longer bull run.

42418070,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcZOX,1716555600,Who Needs an Off-Ramp? Ether.fi Plans Visa Card for Crypto Investors,"The newest product from liquid restaking startup Ether.fi could finally help ""paper rich"" crypto degens turn their blockchain investments into spending money.  Ether.fi Cash will be a mobile wallet and Visa credit card that borrows USDC, the popular USD-pegged stablecoin, against one's decentralized finance (DeFi) investments and can be paid off directly via crypto.  ""Our mission is to build a suite of integrated apps that make DeFi actually usable for normal people,"" said Ether.fi founder Mike Silagadze. ""Cash is your spending account, with the dream being that you never have to off-ramp"" from the blockchain. ""Off-ramping"" refers to the tedious (and fee-laden) process of converting between cash and crypto.  Today, Ether.fi is best known as a service for funneling assets into EigenLayer, the Ethereum-based restaking giant that helps investors secure upstart blockchain services in exchange for rewards. EigenLayer has drawn in some $18 billion worth of deposits over the past year, with over $5.5 billion coming from users who initially deposited their money into Ether.fi in exchange for eETH tokens – a kind of receipt on EigenLayer deposits that can be traded in crypto markets like any other asset.  Read more: With Mastercard, MetaMask Tests First Blockchain-Powered Payment Card  In addition to its ""Stake"" program, Ether.fi also has a ""Liquid"" program, where users can deposit their funds into vaults that follow hand-curated trading strategies.  Ether.fi Cash cardholders will be able to borrow funds against their Stake or Liquid deposits and use the interest from those investments to automatically pay off their bills. Users can alternatively convert assets directly into USDC, allowing for instant settlement.  With Cash, ""you on-ramp once onto Ether.fi and then you never have to off-ramp again because you can save, invest, and spend all your money,"" said Silagadze. ""You can get paid in crypto, and you can just live your life normally without plugging into the TradFi ecosystem."" Ether.fi aims to offer a crypto-centric rewards program akin to those offered by Chase and other legacy card providers. It also aims to differentiate itself from traditional credit cards through its fee structure, which will follow the DeFi market rather than the standard 15-30% APR charged by regular credit cards.  Cash is not the first swing at a crypto-based card, but Silagadze insists that previous attempts to build similar products have amounted to ""garbage.""  ""Most of them are Visa debit cards,"" he said. ""Visa debit cards are pointless because you can only use them for, like, hotels and car rentals. You can't use them for a lot of stuff. They're just not practical.""  ""This is an actual credit card,"" Silagadze emphasized.  He expects Cash to roll out to consumers starting in September, but it is unlikely, for regulatory reasons, to be available in certain large markets, including the U.S..  Using crypto as cash will always have its unique complexities – from market considerations to tax implications.  ""Initially, this is designed for crypto natives,"" said Silagadze, ""But if somebody is thinking of becoming a proper degen, looking at something like this might make them feel like, 'Alright, this actually helps me navigate this universe.'""",POSITIVE,USDC,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | USDC,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/05/24/who-needs-an-off-ramp-etherfi-plans-visa-card-for-crypto-degens,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7359bc22608ce1cc19e01b61aca52fb3b25e875f-1500x844.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

After months of hovering, the coin has seen a surge in price, and analysts are now pointing to signs within the derivatives market suggesting this rally might have legs. Related Reading: Next Big Move For Bitcoin: Analysts Predict A Potential Breakout At $71,500 Taker Buy Sell Ratio Nears Equilibrium One key indicator is the Taker Buy Sell Ratio, a metric that tracks the volume of buy orders compared to sell orders in ETH’s perpetual futures market. Traditionally, a ratio below 1 suggests more sell orders are flooding the market, potentially driving the price down. Conversely, a ratio above 1 indicates a dominance of buy orders, often a bullish signal. SEC Okays Spot Ethereum ETFs, Market Expectations Reversed The news that the US SEC has approved spot Ethereum ETFs has caused a sharp reversal in the market’s expectations for Ethereum ETF rejection this week, and as a result, the price of Ethereum (ETH) is moving erratically in late Thursday activity. As of right now, Ethereum was trading for about $3,770. That is both considerably higher than the previous session low of $3,500 and sharply lower than the previous session highs of over $4,000. BOOM!! APPROVED! There it is. The SEC just approved spot #Ethereum ETFs. What a turn of events. It’s really happening. h/t @PhoenixTrades_ pic.twitter.com/KQ39mDyCbT — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) May 23, 2024 CryptoQuant, a leading crypto analytics platform, recently reported that ETH’s Taker Buy Sell Ratio, observed using a 7-day simple moving average, is poised to cross above its 1-center line. This signifies a decline in sell orders and a potential rise in buying pressure. This suggests that the coin may soon retake the $4,000 price level. Related Reading: Tiny Pepe, Big Dreams: Memecoin Explodes, Eyes Dominance In The Dog House This upward trend in the Taker Buy Sell Ratio indicates a potential shift in market dynamics, noted ShayanBTC, a pseudonymous analyst at CryptoQuant. If the ratio continues to rise, it may signal a reduction in aggressive selling pressure, which could be a positive development for ETH’s price, ShayanBTC added. Futures Open Interest Reaches New Highs Another data point bolstering the bullish case comes from the Futures Open Interest metric. This metric tracks the total amount of outstanding futures contracts that haven’t been closed or settled. A rising Open Interest suggests more traders are entering new positions, potentially anticipating a price increase. Related Reading: XRP Declares War On Uncertainty: Analyst Predicts Breakout Fueled By Regulation According to Coinglass, another crypto analytics platform, ETH’s Futures Open Interest has skyrocketed to a new all-time high of $16 billion. This signifies a surge in market participation, with more traders betting on ETH’s future. The all-time high OI suggests a significant increase in investor confidence. This could be due to several factors, including growing institutional adoption of ETH and the upcoming Ethereum 2.0 upgrade.

42418089,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcZi9,1716552286,First Mover Americas: Crypto Extends Slide Despite SEC Ether ETF Filings Approval,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  The SEC's approval of spot ether ETF regulatory filings has yet to spur a rally in crypto prices, which extended their slide during the Asian and European mornings. BTC has lost more than 3.4% in the last 24 hours to trade around $67,400 while ETH is down around 4.5% at $3,700. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), measuring the broader digital asset market, has lost over 3.3%. Ether ETFs are not yet cleared to trade, because the SEC still needs to approve their S-1 filings before investors can buy them. The approval came as a surprise to many. After clearing spot bitcoin ETFs in January, the SEC didn't seem to engage much with issuers on ether ETFs, but that changed in recent days.  Bitcoin and ether both experienced wild swings in the run-up to the SEC's ETF decision on Thursday. ETH tumbled to $3,500 before surging to $3,900 as the first reports came through that approval of some filings was imminent. BTC, meanwhile, sank below $66,500, then spiked to $68,300 before settling just below $68,000. Liquidations across all leveraged crypto derivative positions soared to over $350 million during the day, the most since May 1, CoinGlass data shows. The bulk of the positions were longs betting on rising prices, worth roughly $250 million, suggesting that over-leveraged traders were caught off-guard by the sudden price plunge.  Kabosu, the Shiba Inu dog who inspired the dogecoin meme and thereafter the DOGE cryptocurrency, died at the age of 17. Kabosu’s picture inspired the creation of DOGE in 2013, initially starting off as a joke currency. DOGE’s success later birthed a whole cohort of dog-themed tokens such as SHIB and FLOKI, which have since cumulatively become one of the industry’s biggest sectors. “We will be holding a farewell party for Kabo-chan on Sunday, May 26th. It will be held at Flower Kaori in Kotsu no Mori, Narita City, from 1pm to 4pm,” her owner wrote in a blog post.  Chart of the Day  The heatmap shows the liquidation data in the crypto market over the last 24 hours, as recorded by Coinglass.  It shows the unusually high figure of nearly $150 million ($100 million of which is longs) in ether futures being liquidated.  The figure is double BTC's amount – a very rare instance.  This comes on the back of record open interest and the volatility around the ETF event.

28377296,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=609627,1716550203,Ready For Liftoff: XRP Price Primed To Skyrocket Before November,"Crypto analyst JT (@JTheretohelp1) has provided a technical analysis indicating a pivotal movement for XRP before November this year. His analysis, shared on social media platform X, presents a detailed view of the XRP price in the 2-month chart (XRP/USD) constrained within a converging triangular formation, signaling an impending breakout. Why A Decision Looms Before November For XRP JT stated: “Love it or hate it, something BIG is going to happen with XRP before November.” The triangular pattern, outlined by a descending red resistance line and an ascending green support line, shows the XRP price action becoming increasingly constrained. The resistance line, touched at points identified by red arrows, has marked significant downturns in the asset’s price. Similarly, the ascending support line, indicated by green arrows, shows where the price has found rising support levels. This triangle is predicted to culminate at its apex in November, a critical juncture that could define the future trajectory of XRP. Related Reading: XRP Declares War On Uncertainty: Analyst Predicts Breakout Fueled By Regulation Price levels within this triangular formation have fluctuated, with the resistance peak in the penultimate 2 month candle and support level touched with the current candle. The convergence of these trendlines at the apex implies a decision point where volatility is expected to increase, leading to a potential breakout or breakdown. Further technical insight is gleaned from the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator, displayed at the bottom of the chart. This momentum indicator, comprising a MACD line (orange) and a signal line (blue), helps determine market direction and momentum shifts. Currently, the MACD line is approaching a crossover with the signal line, a critical event often interpreted as a bullish signal if the MACD line crosses above. Notably, the histogram, representing the difference between the MACD and signal lines, is transitioning from red to green bars, indicating a reduction in bearish momentum and a potential shift towards bullish sentiment. Related Reading: XRP Price Nears Major Converging Point: Analyst Predicts 3,600% Jump To $20 The MACD’s behavior in relation to its centerline (zero value on the Y-axis of the MACD plot) will be crucial. A cross above the centerline can confirm a shift to bullish momentum, coinciding with the triangle’s apex and potentially catalyzing the anticipated breakout. “One of the longest running triangles in the crypto market is approaching a date with destiny @ its apex. That apex happens to end in November (white line). If the MACD can turn up, Boom,” JT concluded. In summary, JT’s analysis of XRP suggests a significant market movement tied to the apex of a longstanding triangular pattern by November. The alignment of MACD signals and the tightening price action within the triangle provide a compelling narrative for traders and investors. As such, monitoring these two indicators will be essential for those involved in the XRP market, as the resolution of this pattern could signal major price movements. At press time, XRP price stood at $0.5221.

This could create a more welcoming environment for cryptocurrencies like XRP, potentially leading to wider adoption and increased investor confidence. Investors Embrace Crypto, But Newcomer Shakes Things Up The cryptocurrency market is witnessing a growing appetite from institutional investors, with Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) increasingly incorporating digital assets into their offerings. This trend signifies growing recognition of the long-term potential of cryptocurrencies and could provide a significant boost to XRP’s value. The inclusion of cryptocurrencies in ETFs validates their legitimacy and opens the door for a wider pool of institutional capital to flow into the crypto space. Legal Battle Looms Large, Verdict Could Impact XRP’s Trajectory Perhaps the most significant factor influencing XRP’s future lies in the ongoing legal battle surrounding its regulatory status. A verdict, expected any day now, could have a profound impact on the currency’s trajectory. A favorable outcome could eliminate a major hurdle for XRP, paving the way for wider acceptance and market growth. Conversely, an unfavorable verdict could create new regulatory roadblocks, hindering XRP’s progress. Related Reading: Déjà Vu?

Traders say they expect a significant influx of institutional capital into the ether market in the long term.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} and ether {{ETH}} prices fell in the past 24 hours even as several ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) were approved for listing on U.S. exchanges.  Ether has dropped 4% since the approval, CoinGecko data shows. It had risen 20% over the course of a week amid indications of pending approval and updated odds of the ETFs getting approved. The broad-based CoinDesk 20, a liquid index that tracks the biggest tokens, fell 4.5% over 24 hours and the crypto market cap lost 2.9% to $2.5 trillion.  “Ethereum's sell-off on positive news is a typical ""buy the rumors, sell the facts"" reaction of speculators,” Alex Kuptsikevich, a senior market analyst at FxPro, said in an email to CoinDesk. “We shouldn't be surprised if the price pulls back to the $3000 area again, returning to an important consolidation area. From these levels, large institutional investors can start building a position in ETFs.  “We saw the same in January after the approval of the Bitcoin ETF, which took 19% off its price in the following two weeks before there was a spectacular reversal,” he said.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Thursday approved key regulatory filings tied to ether ETFs, a historic milestone for the second-largest cryptocurrency. They are not, however, cleared to trade. Although the SEC approved the 19B-4 form that allows for the offering and listing of ETFs, it must still green light the funds' S-1 filings before investors can buy them.  The regulator approved documents for eight ETFs – from VanEck, Fidelity, Franklin, Grayscale, Bitwise, ARK Invest 21Shares, Invesco Galaxy and BlackRock – for listing on the Nasdaq, NYSE Arca, and Cboe BZX exchanges.  If the ETFs are approved for trading, a significant influx of institutional capital is likely. Standard Chartered predicted inflows of as much as $45 billion in the first 12 months.

Tigran Gambaryan, Binance’s compliance head, was seriously ill and needed medical attention.  A Nigerian court on Thursday adjourned the money laundering trial against Binance and two of its executives to June 20 as one of the executives was ill, a family spokesperson for the executives told CoinDesk.  Tigran Gambaryan, a U.S. citizen and Binance’s head of financial crimes compliance, was charged with both tax evasion and money laundering along with his employer. Gambaryan is “very ill and requires comprehensive medical attention,” his lawyer said in a letter to trial judge Emeka Nwite, a Reuters report said.  After Gambaryan broke down on Thursday, the medical facility gave him intravenous treatment for malaria, his lawyer said in the letter.  Gambaryan, who turned 40 in prison last week, was moved to Kuje prison, which houses members of the Boko Haram terrorist group, after being detained by Nigerian authorities in February. He was also detained alongside British-Kenyan regional manager for Africa, Nadeem Anjarwalla, who later escaped but was included in the money laundering charges.  “Yesterday, despite numerous signs of severe illness, my husband was still required to appear in court, where he later collapsed,"" Gambaryan’s wife, Yuki Gambaryan, said in the statement seen by CoinDesk. “The conditions in the notorious Kuje prison are, in a word, devastating. My husband is a strong, healthy person, but he is facing an environment that would bring even the strongest among us to our knees.""  Gambaryan was also meant to appear on Wednesday for his arraignment regarding the tax evasion charges but this was postponed to June 14, a family spokesperson said at the time. He did not appear for that session, Reuters reported.

28370005,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=609604,1716538828,"When Spot Ethereum ETFs Go Live ‘Expect A Bloodbath’, Says Expert","Thomas Fahrer, co-founder of Apollo, a firm focused on Bitcoin adoption, has issued a stark warning regarding the potential market dynamics following the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs. As the market anticipates this new development, Fahrer suggests that the transition might not be smooth for Ethereum. “The Grayscale Ethereum Trust launched in 2017 and accumulated most of its $9 billion dollars worth of ETH well before staking existed. These funds will be unlocked now. Expect a bloodbath. It will accelerate the ETH -> BTC Trade. Hold me to account if I’m wrong. But I doubt it,” Fahrer declared via social media platform X. Spot Ethereum ETFs – A “Sell The News” Event? The imminent approval of spot Ethereum ETFs, similar to earlier this year’s launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs, is expected to convert the $9 billion (approximately 2.94 million ETH) locked in Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into one such ETF. Historical precedent with Bitcoin suggests potential volatility; after the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, Bitcoin experienced more than a 20% drop in value within 12 days amid significant sell-offs from similar conversions. Related Reading: Ethereum Soars 5.6% Ahead Of ETF Decision, Analysts Set Bigger Price Target One of the main reasons the spot BTC ETF approval turned out to be a “sell the news” event was Grayscale’s transition from an Ethereum Trust to a spot ETF. Until now, Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) saw outflows of more than 50% of its BTC holdings. And the ETHE could be reinforced by the fact that ETH staking is a lucrative option to earn an additional yield. Currently, Grayscale holds over $9 billion in locked Ethereum that cannot be sold or traded until the ETF is operational. Should the approval go through, this large amount of Ethereum will suddenly become liquid, potentially leading to substantial market sell-offs if initial demand does not meet the volume of outflows from Grayscale’s new ETF. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Come Alive: Are They Buying Or Selling? Julio Moreno, head of research at CryptoQuant, highlighted a critical market indicator that could suggest the market has already begun to react. “Seems like the market has already priced the Ethereum spot ETF approval. Grayscale’s ETHE discount to ETH has significantly narrowed in the last few days. The same happened between GBTC and Bitcoin as the Bitcoin Spot ETF approval was nearing,” Moreno noted via X. While the short-term impact might mirror the turbulent times seen during the Bitcoin ETF launch, the long-term implications for Ethereum could be different. Observers note that despite the initial downturns seen in Bitcoin’s valuation post-ETF, the introduction of a spot ETF was eventually beneficial, leading to greater market acceptance and a price surge. “BTC rallied 75% in 63 days after the spot ETF was approved. If ETH follows the same trend (if approved), this would take it to $6,446 by July 23,” crypto analyst Miles Deutscher noted. At press time, ETH traded at $3,676.

28362716,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=609573,1716526837,"Coinbase Bears The Brunt Of Supreme Court’s Dogecoin Verdict, DOGE Suffers 4% Slump","In a recent ruling that could have implications for the crypto industry, the US Supreme Court unanimously sided against US-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, over a 2021 Dogecoin (DOGE) sweepstakes dispute. The court’s decision, delivered by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, dismissed Coinbase’s argument that a ruling against it would invite legal turmoil, emphasizing the importance of contractual agreements and the role of courts in resolving disputes. Coinbase Arguments Dismissed The key issue was whether the dispute should be submitted to arbitration or litigated in court. According to Bloomberg Law, the court emphasized that arbitration requires the consent of the parties and that in cases involving conflicting contracts, the court must determine the parties’ intent. Coinbase had contended that a ruling against it would “create chaos” by encouraging parties to challenge arbitration agreements. However, the court rejected this concern, stating that it did not foresee such chaos arising from its decision. Related Reading: Is $77,600 The Next Step For Bitcoin? On-Chain Pricing Model Hints So The case revolved around a sweepstakes in which consumers alleged they were deceived into paying $100 to participate. The conflict emerged due to the presence of two contracts that pointed to different dispute resolution mechanisms. David Suski and others who participated sued the exchange and the company that ran the Dogecoin sweepstakes. They alleged violations of California’s false advertising law, unfair competition law, and the Consumer Legal Remedies Act. While a general user agreement mandated arbitration for all disputes, a sweepstakes-specific contract stipulated that disputes must be brought before a California court. Varying Outcomes In Future Cases? Justice Jackson highlighted the need for a court to determine which contract should govern the resolution of the dispute in such situations. However, the court refrained from addressing whether the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals correctly determined that the sweepstakes-specific contract “superseded” the general user agreement, deeming it beyond the scope of the question presented. Justice Neil Gorsuch provided a concurring opinion, emphasizing the contractual nature of arbitration and suggesting that different facts could yield a different outcome. He noted that the enforceability of arbitration depended on the parties’ agreement. Related Reading: Déjà Vu?

Double-Digit Drop For COIN, DOGE Follows Suit Following the verdict, Coinbase stock, which trades under the ticker COIN, took a significant hit, plunging over 11% to a valuation of $220. This decline came as a surprise given the initial expectations of a potential victory. Prior to the ruling, Coinbase’s stock had reached a high of $240 on Wednesday.

28360177,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=609502,1716523207,Analyst Says “Only A Matter Of Time” Before Bitcoin Flies Past ATH,"An analyst explained how Bitcoin’s availability for trading has quietly declined during the asset’s recent consolidation phase. Bitcoin May Be In A Good Position To Set New All-Time Highs In a new post on X, analyst Willy Woo discusses the recent trend in the Bitcoin inventory sitting on centralized exchange platforms. Related Reading: Is $77,600 The Next Step For Bitcoin? On-Chain Pricing Model Hints So The chart below shows how the spot and paper BTC reserves have changed over the past few years. As the graph shows, the Bitcoin sitting in spot wallets has been declining over the last couple of months. The total amount of such BTC in the custody of central entities has now dropped to just 2.3 million. It’s also apparent that the total sum of the spot and “paper” BTC (highlighted in purple) has declined at the same time. Paper BTC here refers to derivatives products related to cryptocurrency that don’t actually require investors to own the asset. Thus, given that the combined sum of the exchange inventory has gone down for the cryptocurrency, it would appear that the decrease in the spot BTC isn’t because paper BTC has replaced it. Generally, the supply of exchanges is considered part of the Bitcoin supply, which is “available” for trading. As such, due to how supply-demand dynamics work, less of this available supply may be a constructive sign for the cryptocurrency. From the graph, it’s visible that this decline in the exchange inventory has come during a period where the price of the cryptocurrency has struggled after setting a new all-time high (ATH). As Woo notes, While everyone was freaking out that Bitcoin price was not rising the last 2 months, available BTC was quietly being scooped up, and importantly without paper BTC printed in its place. Thus, the fact that the available supply has gone down during such a period could be a bullish sign for the coin. “It’s only a matter of time before BTC squeezes past all-time highs,” says the analyst. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Come Alive: Are They Buying Or Selling? In another X post, Woo also discussed how capital inflows into Bitcoin have just started to pick up again after registering a steep drop earlier. As the chart shows, network inflows spiked alongside the all-time high, but they observed a major slowdown in the consolidation that followed. The inflows from spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), highlighted in light green, also disappeared earlier, but they have now made a comeback alongside these fresh capital inflows. BTC Price Bitcoin had recovered as high as $71,000 earlier but appears to have slipped off over the last few days as it has now returned below the $68,000 level.

In an announcement on Thursday, the foundation expressed its commitment to leveraging its technology and revealed additional details about the upcoming developments. Fantom Introduces Sonic Chain According to the foundation’s blog post, with the completion of the upgrade for their Opera chain on the horizon, Fantom is directing its focus towards creating a new “high-throughput” chain called Sonic (S). The introduction of the Sonic network will coincide with the establishment of the Sonic Foundation, which will assume responsibility for governance and treasury management functions. Additionally, Sonic Labs will spearhead the growth of decentralized applications (dApps), partnerships, and user engagement. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Drop Below $70,000 Apparently Driven By Lack Of Interest, Glassnode Data Shows Developed under the guidance of Professor Bernhard Scholz, a virtual machine developer, and led by decentralized finance (DeFi) expert Andre Cronje, the Sonic chain represents a new type of Layer-1 platform with a native Layer-2 bridge connected to the Ethereum (ETH) network. The Sonic chain is reportedly designed to serve as a Layer 1 solution connected to Ethereum via a Layer 2 bridge. This integration is intended to allow Sonic to leverage Ethereum’s liquidity, user base, and protocols. As a result, the network will combine the benefits of a Layer-1 platform, such as affordability, scalability, and speed, with the security of a Layer-2 bridge, providing access to native ETH and other assets on Ethereum. $10 Million Raised In Strategic Funding Round Regarding the “S” token, a recent governance vote has secured compatibility and migration between the decentralized platform’s native token FTM and S on a 1:1 basis. Fantom also announced the successful completion of a $10 million strategic funding round led by Hashed, one of Korea’s cryptocurrency funds. This funding initiative for the foundation is expected to expand further in the coming months. In addition to Hashed, UOB Ventures, Signum Capital, and Aave (AVE) Foundation, along with angel investors Stani Kulechov, Robert Leshner, Michael Egorov, Fernando Martinelli, Tarun Chitra, and Sam Kazemian, and individual partners from UOB, have all provided support during the funding round. The capital raised in the latest round of funding will be used exclusively to support strategic growth initiatives and ecosystem development within the Fantom network, according to the foundation’s statement, which concluded by saying: Our team is steadfast in exploring how the Sonic chain can impact and elevate several different DeFi and real-world use cases. Industries and applications such as real-world assets, perpetual DEXs, payments, trading, and high-transaction-based games, can be transformed by the speed and high throughput of Sonic. FTM Faces Potential Downtrend Continuation Despite these developments, the FTM token has exhibited a lackluster response to the successful funding round and the potential benefits of the Sonic chain. As a result, the token has declined by over 4% within a 24-hour period, putting a significant level of support for the native token at risk. Related Reading: Ethereum Soars 5.6% Ahead Of ETF Decision, Analysts Set Bigger Price Target Currently trading at $0.8033, the FTM token’s immediate prospects hinge on the crucial $0.7994 support level. A breach of this support could lead to further price declines, with the next major support at $0.755. On the other hand, if renewed bullish momentum and increased buying pressure emerge, the token may encounter resistance at the $0.844 and $0.8750 levels before potentially retesting the key $0.9 zone. Reclaiming the $1 milestone remains pivotal for the token’s overall outlook.

28355435,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=609525,1716516019,Bitcoin’s Network Strengthens: Mining Difficulty And Hash Rate Spike Amid ETH ETF Buzz,"Bitcoin mining difficulty has adjusted upwards by nearly 2%, reaching over 84.4 trillion, as the network’s average hash rate surged past 600 EH/s. This increase comes amid growing optimism in the crypto market, particularly due to speculation about the potential approval of spot Ethereum ETFs in the United States. Notably, Bitcoin mining difficulty measures how difficult it is to find a hash below a given target. The Bitcoin network has a global block difficulty that adjusts every 2,016 blocks (roughly every two weeks) to ensure that the time between blocks mined remains around 10 minutes, despite the number of miners and their growing computing power. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Significant Adjustment: Mining Difficulty Hits 18-Month Low – What’s Next For Miners? This difficulty adjustment helps maintain the network’s regular block time, ensuring stability and security. Significant Shifts In Bitcoin Mining The adjustment of BTC mining difficulty seen earlier this month marked a significant shift, as the metric saw a drop of nearly 6%, the largest decrease since the bear market in December 2022. This rebound in hash rate from the 580-590 EH/s range to over 600 EH/s aligns with a broader crypto market rally fueled by expectations of regulatory advancements in Ethereum products. The concept of mining difficulty is crucial for understanding how Bitcoin self-regulates the production of new blocks. The difficulty increases as more miners join the network, making it harder to mine new blocks. Conversely, the difficulty drops if the number of miners decreases, making mining easier. This mechanism ensures that the introduction of new BTC into the market remains steady and predictable, irrespective of fluctuations in the number of miners. This recent increase in mining difficulty coincides with a slight recovery in Bitcoin’s hash price, which had fallen to an all-time low at the end of April. The hash price, a metric developed by Luxor, a Bitcoin mining services firm, measures the expected earnings per unit of hash rate daily. It has rebounded from less than $50 per PH/s per day to around $54.6 per PH/s per day, providing a minor relief to miners after the recent market downturns. Bitcoin’s Price Movements And Future Expectations While Bitcoin’s price has experienced a minor dip of 2% in the last 24 hours, it maintains a weekly uptrend of 3.9%, trading at $68,132. This movement is closely watched as investors and traders await the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s decision on spot Ethereum ETFs, which could significantly influence the entire crypto market. In response to these developments, a prominent analyst known as BitQuant shared insights via social media platform X, predicting substantial growth for Bitcoin. According to BitQuant, Bitcoin is expected to reach $95,000, with a significant rise to $80,000 anticipated in May.

Bitcoin Could See Upside Above $80,000 In a recent X (formerly Twitter) post, a crypto analyst identified as ‘CrediBullCrypto’ has doubled down on his previous prediction of an ultra-bull scenario for Bitcoin in the future. The analyst’s insights on Bitcoin’s recent activities suggest that the downside risk may be less significant than previously anticipated, paving a bullish path for a massive upside for Bitcoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Spend $6.3 Billion In One Day As Historic BTC Buy Signal Appears Sharing a graphical chart of Bitcoin’s price actions from April to May 2024 in a YouTube video, Credibull Crypto predicted that Bitcoin could see its price rising above $100,000 in this projected ultra-bull scenario. The focal point of his analysis was based on the Open Interest (OI) in Bitcoin’s perpetual futures on Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange. According to the crypto analyst, Open Interest has reached 78,000 BTC, significantly higher than its baseline of 64,000 BTC. CrediBull Crypto revealed that this current Open Interest was in a danger zone. This is because the 14,000 BTC difference typically indicates elevated market activities, which often precede volatile price movements. Additionally, the CrediBull Crypto revealed that a single unidentified Bitcoin whale was responsible for approximately 10,000 BTC of the increased 14,000 BTC Open Interest. This means that the anonymous whale controls 70% of all the added Open Interest on Binance perpetual futures since the baseline. He also disclosed that in the scenario where the anonymous whale can withstand 10% to 15% downward pressure without liquidating their assets, the actual available Open Interest that would be vulnerable to a decline would be only 4,000 BTC, instead of the initial 14,000 BTC addition. The analyst revealed that out of the 4,000 BTC, some would be directional shorts, noting that the net long positions at risk would be even lower. Given this theory, CrediBull Crypto argued that the potential for a downside is more limited. As a result, the ultra bull scenario where Bitcoin’s price surges to new all-time highs was worth considering. Potential Retracement Towards $60,000 In his YouTube video, CrediBull Crypto also highlighted a potential retracement slightly above the $60,000 price mark. The analyst predicted a bearish scenario, where Bitcoin could see its price falling significantly towards $62,000 to $63,000. Related Reading: XRP Price Nears Major Converging Point: Analyst Predicts 3,600% Jump To $20 At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s price is trading at $69,774, reflecting a 0.08% decrease in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. CrediBull Crypto disclosed that Bitcoin had failed to break through key resistance levels above $70,000. He predicts that consistent declines and liquidations could potentially trigger a bottom below $60,000. However, he also revealed that such a bearish turnaround was highly unlikely at this time, as Bitcoin’s price movements currently indicates an ultra bullish scenario.
