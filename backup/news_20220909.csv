2471306,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/?p=246305,1662766216,The Crypto World Can’t Wait for the ‘Ethereum Merge’,"After almost six years of waiting, the Ethereum merge is finally set to take place in September this year. There will be two stages for Ethereum merge to be public in the crypto market- the first stage, Bellatrix, happening on September 6 and the final stage, Paris, happening between September 10 and September 20. If all goes according to plan, the Merge will take place around Sept. 15. The change would shift Ethereum to a more energy-efficient infrastructure, addressing the widespread criticism that crypto&apos;s climate impact outweighs its possible benefits. As a result of the Ethereum merge, the blockchain will become 99.5 percent more energy efficient after shedding its power-hungry proof-of-work consensus mechanism. The merge is also believed to reduce processing times, lower transaction fees, and help the blockchain scale in the future. What is Ethereum Merge? At basic level, the merge (sometimes called Ethereum 2.0, Eth 2, or ETH 2.0) is an upgrade to the Ethereum blockchain that will reduce its environmental impact, increase security in the network, and enable Ethereum developers to introduce new features and increase the scalability of the chain. But if you are looking for a technical definition, mostly lifted from Ethereum.org: The Merge is an upgrade to the Ethereum platform that will merge the Ethereum Mainnet with the Beacon Chain, marking a transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake.

DeFi is different from traditional finance in that depositing and lending is done without normal banking intermediaries. To accomplish this, users need to have a general understanding of some of the technical differences between simply depositing value with an institution and doing it through a decentralized application. While broad crypto adoption remains strong judging from wallet address growth and hashrates of leading coins, many users still require easier to understand interfaces. This UI problem led to the rise of custodial crypto institutions like Celsius Network (CEL-USD) and Voyager Digital (VGX-USD)(OTCPK:VYGVQ) .

On Friday the largest cryptocurrency by market value rallied over 10% to the $21,000 level, its largest daily gain in six months.  BTC was trading at $21,180 as of 3:08 p.m. ET. As recently as Tuesday the price had dipped as low as $18,500.  “If buyers continue with the same sentiment, even an area of $22,400-$23,000 could be reached,” Daniel Kostecki, senior market analyst at Conotoxia, told CoinDesk in an email.  The CoinDesk Market Index, which gauges the broad performance of 148 digital assets, rose 5.8%, helping to push the industry’s overall market capitalization past $1 trillion.  The move could be seen as “part of the larger realization of the undervalued digital asset market,” according to Sheraz Ahmed, managing partner at blockchain solutions provider Storm Partners.  Ahmed suggested in a Telegram message that the price rebound is tied to multiple factors, including the European Central Bank’s interest rate hike on Thursday and FTX Ventures buying a 30% stake in Anthony Scaramucci’s SkyBridge Capital.  The bitcoin price jump still drew into the industry’s concerns on whether this sudden reaction could be seen as a positive in the long term.  Investors might “sell it off at any moment,” Kostecki said.  The bitcoin price was up 7.1% in the past month but still fell by 10.1% over the past 30 days because of high volatility over the summer.  Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto hedge fund manager BitBull Capital, said Friday’s bitcoin price action can be attributed to “typical short covering and a squeeze, since not much has materially changed in the macro environment.”  “We don’t expect a long-lasting trend shift at the moment and look forward to further accumulation around and below the $20K region for BTC,” he told CoinDesk via a text message.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/09/09/after-big-rally-past-21k-bitcoins-price-momentum-may-not-last,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d14435431859ed5f862d9aba064c4d7a5f2a07aa-1040x780.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A Friday filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission revealed the stock offering, which will be for “general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of bitcoin.”  The timing stands out because it's the first tangible sign that founder Michael Saylor, who recently stepped down as CEO to become executive chairman and focus on buying bitcoin, really is not backing off his audacious plan to turn MicroStrategy into a crypto proxy. Since 2020, he's used money raised from stock and bond offerings to purchase about 130,000 bitcoin, worth more than $2 billion.  MicroStrategy's stock has, as a result, become tethered to the price of bitcoin – resulting in a $1.2 billion loss on the bitcoin bet given this year's plunge. But the shares surged 12% Friday as bitcoin jumped almost 10%. The stock fell about 1.5%, though, in after-hours trading following the announcement of the stock offering, which will dilute the value of existing shares.  Cowen and BTIG, two of the most-prominent investment banks that covers crypto-related stocks, are leading the stock offering.  Saylor and MicroStrategy were recently sued by the District of Columbia for allegedly evading taxes on Saylor’s earnings in the district.

42373861,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvVgLR,1662758533,Bitcoin's Correlation With Stocks Comes Back as Economic Factors Roil Markets,"The link between bitcoin (BTC) and equity prices, particularly tech stocks, is growing closer again.  According to TradingView, the 90-day correlation between the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and the S&P 500, which includes a strong tech component, reached a value of 0.59 on Friday.  The correlation value involves a mathematical formula that considers the index and crypto’s price movements over time. A correlation above 0.5 is considered moderately strong and above 0.7 very strong, while correlations between 0.3 and -0.3 are weak. (A value of 1 means the movements are perfectly synchronized, whereas negative 1 indicates they're diametrically opposed.)  During a mid-June sell-off that sent prices of riskier assets tumbling, the correlation hit 0.9 amid a souring investment climate. But the value had steadily faded during the summer, sinking to 0.44 on Sept. 5.  The return of a strong connection between bitcoin and stocks comes amid heightened concerns about the economy, inflation, an uncertain geopolitical climate and monetary policies. Many investors consider cryptocurrencies to be risky assets – subjecting them to some of the same influences as the stock market and technology company shares.  The link between the bitcoin price and tech-focused Nasdaq stock index has also tightened recently, reaching a correlation of 0.62 Friday, up from 0.31 on Aug. 15.  The S&P, which includes Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN), has turned positive this week after falling for three consecutive weeks.  Bitcoin (BTC) was changing hands Friday at about $21,000 Friday, after a nearly 10% jump that was the biggest daily price increase in six months.  Analysts said bitcoin's jump was likely related to speculation on Wall Street that a weakening economy may force the U.S. Federal Reserve to ease up on its aggressive campaign to tamp down inflation.  Fed influence  Riyad Carey, research analyst at Kaiko, said Federal Reserve policy will continue to loom large over riskier assets.  “Bitcoin has behaved similarly to tech stocks, albeit with some idiosyncratic events, namely forced selling by large institutions like Three Arrows Capital,” he told CoinDesk in a written note. “There doesn’t seem to be any indication that crypto will stop moving in response to Fed policy decisions, though Ethereum’s upcoming Merge is one of the more important events in crypto’s recent history.”  Three Arrows Capital was a big crypto hedge fund that imploded when digital-asset prices crashed a few months ago. It is currently in bankruptcy.  Conotoxia Senior Market Analyst Daniel Kostecki said that in bitcoin's two previous significant bear markets – from December 2013 to January 2015 and then the year-long period starting in December 2018 – bitcoin plummeted more than 80% in value.  Bitcoin’s price is currently down more than more than 70% from its all-time near $69,000 in November 2021.  Heightened tensions between Russia and the West over the Ukraine war could continue to roil markets, from energy prices to foreign exchange.  And the tighter correlation means bitcoin wouldn't be immune.  “It is what is happening in the arena of international relations that seems to be the main driver of the markets for both stocks and cryptocurrencies,” he said.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/09/09/bitcoins-correlation-with-stocks-comes-back-as-economic-factors-roil-markets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b1a4149418cacd71aac6480d900fb6eb68839123-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42373855,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvVgGP,1662756339,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Notches Biggest Gain in 6 Months as Price Soars,"Price Action  Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) both moved aggressively higher on Friday, with BTC posting its largest daily gain in six months. It was up by more than 5% in the past 24 hours, while ETH rose by 10% during that time, although both cryptocurrencies remain down by more than 50% for the year.  Friday’s push appears to be tied to signals that the U.S. central bank will reverse course from monetary tightening to monetary easing in 2023, lowering interest rates in the process.  According to the Federal Reserve's ""dot plot,"" the central bank now intends to raise rates to above 3.5% in 2023 and not retreat below 3% until after 2024. The dot plot represents the Fed's expectations of future interest rate levels.  Chicago Federal Reserve President Charles Evans implied on Thursday that next week’s inflation report would help the bank determine future rate hikes. Evans said that he expects rates to top out at around 3.5% to 4%, but that “maybe we don’t have to do it that soon.""  Bitcoin rose 9% on heavy trading volume that began late Thursday night. The price leaped higher during the 3:00 UTC hour and continued to rise throughout much of Friday. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading above $21,000.  Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, rose 5.4%, also on higher-than-average volume. ETH’s hourly chart shows that its ascent began overnight during the same time frame as BTC’s.  U.S. Equities: Traditional financial markets closed higher with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite increasing 1.1%, 1.5% and 2%, respectively.  Commodities: Crude oil futures increased 3.3%, and natural gas futures rose 1.78%. The price of gold declined 0.4%  The dollar index (DXY) declined 0.6%.  Altcoins traded higher, as polkadot (DOT), uniswap (UNI), and avalanche (AVAX) rose 4%, 4% and 7%, respectively.  Latest Prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $22,410 +3.2%      ●Ether (ETH): $1,725 −2.7%      ●S&P 500 daily close: 4,110.41 +1.1%      ●Gold: $1,737 per troy ounce +1.2%      ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 3.36% +0.04      Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time.

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Technical Take  BTC fights to reclaim prior area of support  Bitcoin rose sharply on higher-than-average trading volume on Friday. Volume was roughly twice its 20-day moving average, signaling strong conviction by traders.  BTC is flirting with an area of resistance highlighted in Thursday’s Market Wrap. To recap, the volume profile visible range (VPVR) tool is a tool to identify areas of trading activity, specific to price levels.  The price point coinciding with highest activity levels represents the “point of control,” and highlights areas of price agreement. These areas can be viewed as regions of both resistance and support for an asset. BTC’s current point of control is about $21,400..  BTC’s 10% increase outpaced ETH’s 4.5% climb, which is an aberration, given ETH’s outperformance since July. Most risky assets were higher on the day, as traders appear to be shrugging off Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s hawkish comments on inflation. Bitcoin's outperformance relative to other risky assets on Friday, however, implies that traders see BTC’s recent sell-off as overdone.  With the absence of a specific catalyst, BTC’s price movement appears to be tied to the possibility that the Federal Reserve will slow its pace of rate hikes in 2023, although Fed officials continue to reiterate the need to tighten monetary policy.  Inflation data set to be released next Tuesday will provide investors more clarity on price expectations. Better-than-expected inflation data would provide investors more reason to add to their BTC long positions, and contrary data could be viewed as an opportunity to take profits at current levels.  An important on-chain metric to watch ahead of the release of the consumer price index will be the movement of BTC exchange balances, a measure of the total amount of BTC held on exchanges.  An increase in balances is often viewed as bearish, as traders are moving BTC onto exchanges for the purpose of selling. A decrease implies the opposite, as traders move BTC off of exchanges and into cold storage.

42373863,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvVgIv,1662754645,Crypto Investor Paradigm Argues Infrastructure Providers Should Not Be Subject to US Treasury Sanctions,"Crypto investment firm Paradigm published a nuanced legal argument amid concerns of potential sanctions by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) that would target blockchain base layer participants such as miners and validators.  The post was published on Thursday and comes on the heels of a lawsuit filed by users who believe OFAC exceeded its authority when it sanctioned Tornado Cash smart contract addresses last month.  Paradigm acknowledged that sanctions can be an important tool to preserve national security, but said it believes base layer participants merely record and order data (which may include sanctioned addresses), but do not actively control sanctioned assets. Paradigm further suggested that stringent regulation would eventually push blockchain innovation offshore, making it more difficult to track crypto transactions for legitimate national security purposes.  Paradigm explained that a blockchain “base layer” is essentially a “communications protocol and technology infrastructure,” much like the internet. As such, the base layer must be free from censorship and preserve neutrality in order to maintain its utility as a public good.  “It is widely accepted that the public switched telephone network and the switching centers that allow telephones around the globe to communicate are not expected to filter communications and exclude sanctioned persons. The same argument applies to the infrastructure of the internet. Crypto’s base layer is no different,” the post read.

Bitcoin Stablecoin Supply Ratio Shock Momentum Forms &apos;Buy&apos; Signal As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, out of the 11 previous such buy signals, 10 ended up profitable for the crypto. The &apos;stablecoin supply ratio&apos; (or the SSR in brief) is an indicator that measures the ratio between the market cap of Bitcoin and that of all stablecoins. Generally, whenever investors want to avoid volatility associated with cryptos like BTC, they shift their coins into stablecoins. Once they feel that prices are right to re-enter the markets again, they buy back into them. As such, the total stablecoin supply can be looked at as potential buying pressure for other cryptos. When the value of the SSR is high, it means the BTC supply is higher compared to the stablecoin cap, and thus there is low buying pressure in the market currently.

Both parties have agreed to dismiss the lawsuit, which originated last November when Tarantino announced he would be releasing NFTs using footage from the hit 1994 film he directed, “Pulp Fiction,” which Miramax claimed it owned the redistribution rights to.  “The parties have agreed to put this matter behind them and look forward to collaborating with each other on future projects, including possible NFTs,” Tarantino and Miramax said in a joint statement Friday.  Terms of the deal weren't disclosed. In January, the first NFT from Tarantino’s collection sold for over $1 million at auction.  The case was seen by many as a classic example of Web2 copyright laws being applied in a Web3 environment. Tarantino’s camp had argued that NFTs, which didn't exist at the time of the film’s release, fell outside of the scope of restricted mediums for redistribution.  The NFT collection lives on the SCRT network, which is known for its “secret” NFTs that can contain media viewable only by their holders.

42411375,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNQTD,1662744013,A Currency Crisis Looms: We Need a New Model,"The global economy is staring down the barrel of a currency crisis. That has huge ramifications for the crypto industry.  Emerging-market currencies face a perfect storm: the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine war, soaring commodity prices, rising inflationary expectations, political crises in multiple developing economies and, now, aggressive interest rate hikes from the U.S. Federal Reserve that draw speculative money into the dollar. It’s all putting exchange rates in countless countries under extreme pressure.  Raoul Pal observed this week that, by some measures, there is a more extreme dislocation in Asian currencies now than there was during the region’s 1997-98 financial crisis.  Currency crises like these impose a vicious cycle on emerging-market countries: The exchange rate plunges, local policymakers’ try to contain the fallout but fail, and confidence in their abilities wanes, which further drives down the currency, stoking fears of default among foreign lenders and generating inflation as import prices surge. And all of that further undermines confidence in the currency and the government.  Nations such as Sri Lanka and Lebanon have already entered this dark phase. Others with less overt political problems may well be next as 1998-style “contagion” takes root.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Vicious cycles  I see this as a periodic reminder that our dollar-centric international financial system can give rise to profound global imbalances.  One element of that system – undeniably a bug, not a feature – is that whatever the U.S. does with monetary and fiscal policy to meet its domestic objectives often has negative effects on other countries’ economies.  This was the case before COVID-19, when more than a decade of the Fed’s “quantitative easing” (QE), aimed at lifting the U.S. economy out of a long-lasting post-2008 crisis funk, created oodles of new money that fled the then low-yielding dollar for higher-yielding emerging-market assets.  Predictably, that hot money is now heading “home” to the dollar as the rate hikes make the greenback a much more appealing, higher-yielding store of value than it was a year ago and as geopolitical tensions boost its safe-haven status. That reversal has a brutal whipsaw effect on emerging markets.  Read more: Peruvians Are Buying Crypto to Hedge Against Inflation and Political Instability  It’s nearly impossible for governments of smaller economies to execute effective policy against such sweeping forces outside of their control.  Yet when a crisis arises, the only prescriptions offered – notably from the International Monetary Fund, which recently adopted its routine crisis-fighting role in Sri Lanka and Argentina – put the onus on those local governments to fix the problem.  The proposed solutions can spell political suicide. Central banks jack up rates to stop the flight of capital, and the governments adopt fiscal austerity to placate foreign creditors, squeezing the local economies at their most vulnerable moments. No wonder so many developing countries become breeding grounds for autocrats who respond to their citizens’ concerns with oppressive and xenophobic policies.  Flawed at its core  We have the worst of both worlds – a decentralized system where countries must fend for themselves and yet face excessive, system-wide vulnerability to the actions of just one of them.  Some might argue the U.S. is the exception that benefits from this system in the form of autonomous monetary policy. At the present time, for example, the stronger dollar bolsters the Fed’s efforts to curb inflation because it lowers the cost of imported goods. Previously, demand for dollar assets among central banks’ reserve managers allowed the Fed to execute trillions in QE without generating consumer inflation – at least not for 12 years.  But as former Bank of England Governor Mervyn King famously noted in 2011, these “global imbalances” also hurt the U.S. The distortions in the global price of money frequently generate excesses in the U.S. economy, as with the low mortgage rates that stoked the housing bubble before the 2008 meltdown.  In 2019, King’s successor, Mark Carney, offered a solution with crypto overtones: a new, digital international currency run by the IMF. (That radical idea didn’t get traction in Washington, which may be the reason Carney wasn’t picked for his sought-after job at the helm of the IMF.)  Watch: Crypto’s Slide Hasn't Bled Into the 'Real Economy,' IMF Official Says  But at least Carney was considering action. The current system isn’t sustainable. It’s false comfort to look at the recent strength of the dollar as proof of its reserve status’s staying power. In many respects, the fear-driven flight into dollars is a symptom of the system’s failure and a sign that it must, one day, end.  If so, it’s far better that we plan now for a smooth transition to a different model than undergo the violent rupture threatened by Russia’s and China’s open rejections of the existing one.  A new model  What does that future system look like? Western governments won’t trust a currency issued by the Chinese government, and Europe’s coordination problems mean the euro isn’t really a contender. Perhaps it will be a multi-currency system.  When I wrote “The Unfair Trade” in 2011 – before I’d had any real exposure to bitcoin – I was in the Carney camp. As I saw it, a multilateral reserve currency managed by the IMF was the only way out of our broken financial system.  But now I see the problem in more sweeping terms: The rise of the internet produced a loss of confidence in governments and created new transnational communities of power as wealth imbalances in the age of globalization fueled resentment toward the incumbent neoliberal order. Whatever system emerges, multi-currency or otherwise, it needs to restore people’s sense of control over their assets and identities. And it needs to be digitally native.  That inevitably points to digital currencies – in some form or another.  Read more: Digital Dollar Would Secure Greenback as Global Reserve Currency, Lawmaker Argues  While it’s not clear bitcoin is the answer, not with its failure to decouple from the past year’s slide in financial markets, I continue to believe in the principles upon which Satoshi designed it.  The dollar system’s replacement needs to incorporate some form of digital, censorship-resistant money that’s immune to the failures of centralized governments, something that looks and feels more like the original, decentralized design of the internet.  Whatever comes next, it must reflect the wishes of the human beings who use it. It shouldn’t be up to faceless international bureaucrats to decide.

42373867,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvVgQT,1662742953,Terra’s LUNA Token Gains 200% in a Few Hours Amid Speculative Frenzy,"LUNA, the cryptocurrency of the Terra blockchain’s recreated version after dramatically imploding earlier this year, tripled in price within a few hours time Friday, trading close to its all-time high set in early June when the token was introduced.  The token’s price skyrocketed to almost $7 from less than $2, according to data by cryptocurrency price tracker CoinGecko. At press time, LUNA was changing hands at around $6, up more than 212% in the past 24 hours with vastly higher trading volume seen during recent days.  LUNA is the native token of the second version of the Terra blockchain, brought back to life after Terra’s collapse in May, which wiped out $60 billion in value. The implosion led to investigations for fraud against Terraform Labs, the firm that created the blockchain, and its founder Do Kwon. The old blockchain was rebranded to Terra Classic, and hosts the luna classic (LUNC) token and its stablecoin USTC.  Risky assets such as cryptocurrencies appear to be rallying broadly Friday in a relief rally as multiple economic indicators signal a slowing global economy and traders are weighing the possibility that the Federal Reserve might slow down rate hikes sooner than expected or even cut interest rates next year.  The newly launched CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), which tracks the price movement of a basket of 148 cryptocurrencies measuring the performance of the broader crypto market, is up 5.6% in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin (BTC) is leading the rally as it jumped to $21,000 from $19,000, marking its highest daily gain in six months.  Read more: Crypto’s S&P 500: CoinDesk Unveils Broad-Market, Digital-Asset Index  LUNC has also surged as traders got excited about a new burn scheme that would reduce the token’s hyperinflated supply, as CoinDesk reported Thursday. The rally has somewhat stalled since then, as the coin slid 17% in the past day.  Crypto market watchers are puzzled about LUNA’s wild price movement as there hasn’t been any news or development specific to the network that would ignite hype amid retail traders.  Data by digital asset social intelligence platform LunarCrush points to a retail speculative frenzy, as mentions and engagements on social media platforms have shot up recently.  So far, the new Terra blockchain struggled to attract investors to its ecosystem. The network’s total value locked (TVL) – an important metric in decentralized finance (DeFi) that measures how much value a protocol can accrue from investors – stood at a meager $51 million at press time, while the “old” Terra Classic blockchain’s TVL reached more than $20 billion in May before its collapse, according to DeFi data tracker DeFiLlama.",POSITIVE,BTC | LUNC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | LUNC | MARKET | TRADING,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/09/09/terras-luna-token-gains-200-in-a-few-hours-amid-speculative-frenzy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f2040c07c9eac6373e558ecd3d6686f78235888d-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Its growth has seen it become one of the largest contenders for the leading smart contract network Ethereum, as it presents faster and cheaper transaction options. Its transaction count had quickly multiplied in light of this, and now, the cryptocurrency has neared another important milestone. Almost 100 Billion Transactions With only two years of operations under its belt, Solana has quickly grown in prominence among crypto investors. With an average of 3,000 transactions per second (TPS), the total transaction count on the Solana blockchain is like a runner on steroids. Related Reading: Terra Classic Jumps Double-Digits, Is It Time To Buy? Presently, the total transaction count on the network has surpassed 97.1 billion. This was the count as of Friday when this report was written. Given that the number was around 96 billion on Thursday, Solana&apos;s transaction count is growing at around 1 billion per day. This rate would see the network hit the 100 billion mark before the weekend is over. To put this in perspective, the current daily transaction count on the Ethereum network is a little over 1 million at 13 TPS.

In the years since, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have become popular, the same as La Liga predictions, with a growing number of people searching about them. Here, we&apos;ll look at the most significant benefits of cryptocurrencies. Cryptos are Decentralized One of the most critical features of cryptocurrencies is their decentralization. Unlike traditional fiat currencies, which central banks control, no central authority controls cryptocurrencies. Instead, decentralization, meaning they get distributed across a network of computers. Decentralization makes them more resistant to manipulation and fraud, as there is no single control point. Secure than Fiat Cryptocurrencies are also more secure than traditional fiat currencies. Transactions made using cryptocurrencies get encrypted, meaning they are much more difficult to hack than traditional financial transactions. Additionally, cryptocurrencies are tamper-proof, meaning it is hard to counterfeit them. This makes them ideal for use when you have La Liga picks ready for wagering.

His focus will be on the future of payments, including blockchain technology and the digital ecosystem, according to a statement sent to CoinDesk.  “Tahreem Kampton has joined J.P. Morgan Payments as a senior payments executive with a focus on driving thought leadership to help the payments industry and therefore clients, to evolve, thrive and grow,” said JPMorgan. “Specifically, he will lead co-innovation with key partners in payments, blockchain and the digital ecosystem where JPMorgan has already built a strong foundation.”  JPMorgan has been active in the crypto industry and blockchain technology for years and has been hiring aggressively to bolster its cryptocurrency and blockchain ambitions, including its Onyx division, which was formed in 2020. The unit was the world’s first offering from a global bank of a blockchain-based platform for wholesale payments transactions.  Last year, the bank was reported to have partnered with German industrial group Siemens to develop a blockchain-based system for payments. JPMorgan was also the first bank into the metaverse – in February opening a lounge in Decentraland, a virtual world based on blockchain technology.  Kampton had been with Microsoft in various roles since 1998, according to his LinkedIn profile, rising to corporate treasurer and chief investment officer in January 2021. He retired from Microsoft earlier this year and had been part of advisory boards of various other companies since then.  “We see a new landscape where information, assets and value flow seamlessly between physical, digital and virtual worlds – across borders, in outer space, and even in the metaverse,” Kampton said in the statement.

Many people are not aware of the vast benefits of cryptocurrency, such as using them on NFL Standings. But that&apos;s not an issue because, in this article, we&apos;re going to talk about why you should consider investing in crypto and the benefits of cryptocurrency. Cheap Transactions One of the most significant benefits of using crypto is that it allows you to avoid paying intermediaries. With traditional banking and credit card companies, you can easily get entangled in fees over time. These fees include: Transaction fees -these are charged by banks or payment processors when they process your transactions and send them your way. Credit card processing fees - these are usually around 2% or 3%, depending on the amount you spend, which makes paying with a credit card more expensive than using crypto. No Middlemen You won&apos;t need any of these middlemen. Your financial institution, lawyer, notary and broker will no longer be necessary when you use cryptocurrency in your daily activities. For example, many websites allow you to do this without needing an agent if you want to buy a car or plane ticket online.

I’ve never thought too kindly of Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong or his company. Armstrong to this day seems like a Palo Alto-bred hive drone who by sheer chance emerged from his Y Combinator-branded birthing pod at a moment when cryptocurrency was a huge, obvious opportunity. His commitment to the principles and ideas behind crypto has often seemed, at best, intermittent.  But this week, Coinbase may have helped shift that narrative, at least a little bit. Thursday, we learned the exchange would back a lawsuit against the U.S. Treasury Department over its recent sanctioning of the Tornado Cash mixing service. The agency alleges that the decentralized software has been used by North Korea to launder funds from its various crypto hacks.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  But Tornado is not hosted by any legally targetable entity and its code can be redeployed on Ethereum by anyone. Therein lies the rub: Because it’s software, sanctioning or otherwise restraining the distribution of that code could be in violation of the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.  See also: Cloning Tornado Cash Would Be Easy, but Risky | Opinion  ""We support the Treasury sanctioning bad actors and have worked closely with law enforcement to help bring many bad actors to justice. But the Treasury's actions in this case hurt many law-abiding citizens in addition to a few bad actors, and we believe exceeds their authority,"" Armstrong tweeted on Thursday.  Not just crypto organizations like Coin Center, but also heavyweight digital liberty groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation have made strong arguments that the sanction is deeply threatening to basic American principles of freedom. As I wrote early last month, a major legal clash was nearly inevitable.  But it’s remarkable that Coinbase was first to push the case forward – and it seems like it has found a doozy of a lawsuit to back. First of all, as a Texan, I have to say that finding people in West Texas to stand as plaintiffs is genius. Even if you’re not an old, wizened husk like me, you probably still associate Waco with one of the most disastrous and tragic exercises of federal government power in history: the apocalyptic raid on the Branch Davidian compound on Feb. 28, 1993. And Texans were extremely skeptical of the Feds well before the lawmen of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives opened fire on a building full of people, including children.  Now a Texas jury may get to listen to six users describe their own legitimate reasons for using Tornado Cash and the harm inflicted on them by the government. As complicated as crypto and the ethics of privacy may be, I’m comfortable saying I’d prefer being on Coinbase’s side of the table under those circumstances. (Though the fact the plaintiffs are all pretty much crypto insiders may not be in their favor with West Texans.)  It’s also remarkable to ponder Coinbase’s motivations here. As we’ve seen over the past few weeks, the Tornado Cash sanction threatens to deeply undermine the entire crypto ecosystem as various players weigh whether to blacklist addresses that have interacted with the mixing service. So there is a self-interested angle here, especially with regard to Coinbase’s own plans to expand Ethereum staking services, which could generate massive revenue but also potentially put it at risk of sanctions violation for processing transactions.  This isn’t the first time Armstrong or Coinbase has stood up for its users’ financial rights. In 2017, Armstrong took a swing at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for the tax agency’s alleged overreach by requesting “John Doe” summons for all Coinbase users. However, the exchange has been more than willing to comply with privacy-invasive searches and regulations, and has a shaky history with customer service – among other more concerning recent events.  See also: Coinbase Executives Misled Shareholders About Public Listing, Lawsuit Alleges  So it’s remarkable now that Coinbase has decided to risk incurring regulators’ wrath by going up against the Treasury Department. Most notably, the Treasury doesn’t have direct oversight of the securities law questions that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is currently in the thick of debating, but you have to assume Gary Gensler and Janet Yellen get on the phone every once in a while.  So while it may be defending one material business line, Coinbase’s lawsuit would seem to pose a genuine threat to its overall exchange business, if it even marginally nudges the SEC to crack down on its huge traffic in what regulators firmly believe to be unregistered securities.  In other words, it appears – bizarrely, almost unbelievably – that Coinbase and Brian Armstrong may have actually done something on principle.  Sometimes, people surprise you.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,David Z.

Ebersole’s comments were in response to an interview Gensler did with Nikhilesh De, CoinDesk's managing editor for global policy and regulation, earlier on Thursday.  Gensler “recognized that disclosure in the crypto as a context may not look the same … you're not going to get a 10-K or 10-Q every period from an issuer,” Ebersole said, referring to annual and quarterly financial reports that publicly traded companies must file with the SEC.  “The technology makes it unnecessary. In many cases, a lot of this is very transparent. So it's sort of case by case, but he recognized there may be a difference here, and he's open to that,"" Ebersole said.  Read more: Crypto Doesn't Need More Guidance, SEC Chair Gensler Says  In the meantime, dialogue between the SEC and cryptocurrency issuers is hindered by the agency’s approach, according to Ebersole, who is now chief legal officer at software provider 0x Labs.  “The SEC has not really shown an appetite for just having a discussion that does not hold the potential for enforcement activity,” he said. “Projects are very cautious.”  To solve that problem, Ebersole said he recommends “something analogous to Commissioner Peirce’s Safe Harbor proposal.”  The measure proposed by Hester Peirce, an SEC commissioner, would grant a three-year grace period for developers and require semiannual updates as well as an exit report.  “Something that would let projects come in and have a frank conversation without being worried the next letter they get from the SEC, or the next communication, is going to be a subpoena, is something that would probably be necessary,” Ebersole said.

The factory uses power purchased on the spot market. Therefore, excessive energy costs have harmed profits this year. In January, the margin reached a peak of 74%; by July, it had decreased to 37%. The firm is attempting to negotiate a long-term, fixed-price power purchase deal to reduce its vulnerability to energy market volatility. According to Argo, &apos;Spot power prices in West Texas averaged nearly $0.09 per kWh, which is nearly three times the average price during the month of August in prior years.&apos; Observation Of Mining Expert Wolfie Zhao, a mining expert, observed on Twitter that gross margins for several new mining equipments had decreased due to the market conditions. His estimates show that the Bitmain Antminer S19Pro and S19XP have fallen to 44% and 23%, respectively. At that power rate and current #Bitcoin hashprice, gross margins of even S19Pro and S19XP are down to 44% and 23%, let alone the older models.

42373859,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvVgMh,1662734682,"First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Jumps Most in Six Months, as 'Powell Pivot' Speculation Returns","Price Point: Bitcoin posts its biggest daily gain in six months, surging past $20,000 on speculation the Federal Reserve could quickly pause or reverse monetary-policy tightening as the U.S. economy slides into recession.  Market Moves: CoinDesk rolls out a new broad-market gauge of digital-asset prices, the CoinDesk Market Index – and the media company hopes the new gauge could become the ""S&P 500 of crypto.""  Chart of the Day: The ""backwardation"" in ether futures is starting to fade – perhaps the latest chapter in traders' ongoing efforts to position themselves ahead of the Ethereum blockchain network's upcoming Merge.  This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Price point  By Omkar Godbole and Bradley Keoun  Bitcoin posted its biggest daily gain in six months on Friday, surging past $20,000 as traditional-market investors shrugged off Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's pro-liquidity tightening stance.  Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency by market value, jumped 8.6% to $20,997 and ether (ETH), the native token of Ethereum's blockchain, scheduled to undergo a major technological upgrade next week, rose 4% to $1,705, according to CoinDesk data.  The newly released CoinDesk Market Index rose 5.5%. (Scroll down to Market Moves for more on that.)  The rally appeared tied to speculation that risky assets, from stocks to cryptocurrencies, could draw strength from monetary easing next year – a turnabout from 2022 where central banks from the Federal Reserve to European Central Bank are ratcheting interest rates higher. (The last time the Fed tried to raise interest rates in 2018, markets lurched and Fed Chair Jerome Powell agreed to pause the campaign and then leading a rate-cutting cycle the following year.)  In traditional markets, stock futures were wavering after major U.S. stock indexes finished the day higher on Wednesday. The European Central Bank raised interest rates by 0.75 percentage point, the biggest single hike since it began setting monetary policy in 1999.  In the news, the controversial crypto mixer Tornado Cash once again found itself at the nexus of stolen tokens from a decentralized-finance protocol, as PeckShield spotted $500,000 of the dollar-linked stablecoin dai (DAI) moving through its pipes, Sam Reynolds reports. In August, the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned Tornado Cash, prohibiting all U.S. persons and entities from interacting with the protocol.  And crypto influencer Cooper Turley – one of the original ""yield farmers"" from the 2020 ""DeFi Summer"" – told CoinDesk that he was spinning up a $10 million fund to invest in artists and startup founders bringing crypto and music together.

The CoinDesk Market Index initially consists of 148 digital tokens, said Jodie Gunzberg, managing director for CoinDesk Indices. To be included, each token must have a pricing history from at least two eligible exchanges going back at least 30 days.  “It’s meant to be as inclusive as possible,” Gunzberg said in an interview. “We’re just trying to represent the market.”  The new index joins a growing field of competitors aiming to meet demand from investors and traders for ways to measure the crypto market’s performance. Other providers include Bloomberg Galaxy, CF Benchmarks (part of the Kraken exchange), Nasdaq, Solactive, MarketVector, MSCI and S&P.  Read the full story here.  Chart of The Day  Ether futures ""backwardation"" starts to fade  By Bradley Keoun and Omkar Godbole  Trades surrounding the Ethereum blockchain's upcoming Merge have put the ether (ETH) futures curve into ""backwardation"" – where the futures price trades below the current market or ""spot"" price. That's a departure from the more usual condition of ""contango"" where the futures price is higher than spot.  In the past couple days, though, the discount is starting to shrink.  On the CME exchange, the one-month discount has slimmed to 8.85% from 13% earlier in the week, based on data from crypto-derivatives tracker Skew.  The three-month discount has shrunk to 3.8% from 6%.  Some analysts have linked the backwardation to bets that the Ethereum network might get forked by crypto miners resisting its shift to a less energy-intensive ""proof-of-stake"" blockchain system from the current ""proof-of-work"" version.

42373851,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvVg7b,1662733802,SEC Enforcement Chief: We Can't Ignore Crypto Law-Breaking,"Gurbir Grewal, director of enforcement at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, said his agency can’t look the other way as the cryptocurrency industry violates securities laws.  “It often seems that critics are upset because we're not giving crypto a pass,” Grewal said Friday at a Practising Law Institute conference in Washington, D.C. His brief remarks focused largely on crypto – it was the only industry specifically addressed – revealing how much the agency is currently thinking about digital assets.  The SEC needs to “impartially enforce the laws on the books,” and ignoring them ""would be a betrayal of trust, and that is not an option for us,"" he said.  He also noted that crypto has had an outsized, harmful impact on low-income and nonwhite consumers.  His comments – and more detailed remarks from the division’s new crypto chief – come on the heels of a series of remarks and interviews done by SEC Chair Gary Gensler this week. Gensler also issued a strong warning to the digital assets industry that his agency would not sit idle on enforcing U.S. laws against unregistered exchanges and tokens that fail to register as securities.  David Hirsch, the incoming head of the SEC's crypto enforcement effort, also said at the PLI conference that ""registration is key in this area, particularly for issuers."" The agency wants to see a culture of compliance in crypto, complete with accountants and specialized attorneys that are there to keep the ""wellbeing of their investors forefront in their minds.""  He said crypto platforms need to register and get ""robust systems in place to prevent market manipulation, wash trading and other types of misconduct.""  Hirsch said decentralized finance (DeFi) is a particular area of worry.  ""If you have a purely pseudonymous and absolutely permissionless environment, it is hard to also be regulatorily compliant,"" he said. ""To the extent you have a very low-accountability financial system, I don't know that there's great historical precedent for that being something that is either good for retail investors or has been successful over a long time horizon.""  Hirsch cautioned that DeFi operations need some ability to shield themselves from known fraudsters, and being entirely permissionless makes that difficult.  Commissioner Mark Uyeda also weighed in on what he argued was the agency’s tendency to lean on enforcement instead of dealing with crypto through new rules.  ""To the extent that crypto assets raise unique issues not otherwise addressed in the current rulebook, the commission should consider proposing rules,"" said Uyeda, a recent addition to the commission. Uyeda, a former SEC employee once assigned to work with the Senate Banking Committee's Republican staff, hasn’t previously been heard on cryptocurrency issues.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/09/09/sec-enforcement-chief-says-agency-cant-ignore-law-breaking-in-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bcb0ae6a92cdb0361a467f11c2b6ff037b392dbc-4032x3024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Seychelles-registered crypto company said Friday it secured the license from the BVI's Financial Services Commission under Huobi's regulated local subsidiary Brtuomi Worldwide Limited. Since April, Brtuomi has been one of two participants in a fintech regulatory sandbox set up by the FSC to allow companies to trial new financial solutions and services.

42411374,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNQMb,1662730154,"What Post-Roe America Tells Us About the Need for Privacy, Web3","Two recent events have highlighted both the extreme urgency of the need for internet privacy in the age of Web2 and a way to frame that need as a positive value that goes beyond traditional understandings of what privacy is.  The first: In Nebraska, a 17-year-old girl and her mother are being prosecuted and will be tried – the girl as an adult – for allegedly using a “morning after” pill to induce a miscarriage. A child and her mother face lengthy prison terms for newly invented “crimes,” and it is only possible because Facebook handed over their private messages to Nebraska investigators.  David Chaum, a pioneer in cryptography and in privacy-preserving and secure voting technologies, is the creator and founder of the xx network. In 1995 his company, DigiCash, created and deployed eCash, the first digital currency, which used Chaum's breakthrough blind-signature protocol.  The second: In neighboring Kansas, voters overwhelmingly crushed a ballot initiative to remove the right to abortion from the state constitution, despite the initiative being timed to coincide with a Republican primary and an email sent to voters that blatantly lied about the ballot’s intent. “No” voters included not only Democrats and independents but about 35% of registered Republicans.  Read more: Why Crypto Should Support the American Data Privacy and Protection Act  Pro-choice campaigners say their victory was in large part because they framed the issue in terms of “bodily autonomy” – persons ought to have an absolute right to control their own bodies.  Each of us, though, has not only a physical body but a unique, personal “body of knowledge” about us consisting of everything we do on the internet. Right now, those informational bodies are scattered and not under our control.  In fact, they are under the control of the tech companies that provide us with “free” internet services – not just social media and instant messaging but emails and searches and online purchases: who we communicate with, how much and how often, what we’re interested in, what we pay for.  All that information is collected and sold to advertisers or political groups or provided gratis to government agencies – from zealous state prosecutors to the National Security Agency. We have no informational autonomy, any more than those of us with wombs have a guaranteed right to bodily autonomy post-Roe.  Read more: The Coming Privacy Wars  Internet privacy in Web2 is a dead letter. And because of the enormous clout of Big Tech in the U.S. economy, the likelihood of any legislation being passed that would change this situation more than marginally is very small.  Fortunately, technology offers solutions in the form of cryptography, both established and novel. It is possible not only to encrypt message content against even future quantum computers but to create decentralized networks that “shred” message metadata such that no one but sender and recipient can identify each other – including the network’s node operators. Searches from within such a network can likewise be anonymous and untraceable.  Helplines for people in need of services such as reproductive health care can be made 100% confidential, as can financial transactions using a currency native to the network. We don’t have to depend on the intentionally weak privacy assurances of Web2 megacorporations or the equally weak security of legislation. We can have positive privacy – complete control of our own digital lives.  With digital pseudonyms derived from an inalienable private key, for example, we can provide organizations with exactly the information they legitimately need – no more, no less – without revealing anything more about ourselves.  And as recent events are showing us, informational autonomy is intimately linked not only to bodily autonomy but to defending democracy. Protected spheres of discourse and debate, like the coffeehouses that 18th-century monarchies were perpetually trying to shut down, have always been critical to democracy’s development and survival.  Truly private, decentralized communications networks that not only encrypt message content securely against even future quantum computers but eliminate metadata in transit can provide such protected spheres in the digital age. Without privacy, there is no true freedom of speech.  Bottom line: If Web3 doesn’t provide every individual with informational autonomy, if it isn’t truly decentralized and democratically managed, it’s just Web2.1 in fancy dress.",NEUTRAL,없음,REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,David Chaum,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/09/09/what-post-roe-america-tells-us-about-the-need-for-privacy-web3,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/91dbb295746a753df996e78d31ac31ed558cde58-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Gaming claimed a record 60% of blockchain activity in July, according to a recent DappRadar report. The gaming sector proved largely immune to the crypto bear market that has pulled down the prices of digital assets and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).  Founded in 2020, Los Angeles-based Revolving Games has spent two years developing game publishing tools to build and launch Web3 games. The studio revealed its first product in June, a Battlestar Galactica-themed blockchain game developed in partnership with Gala Games and NBCUniversal. Additional details about the title will be revealed in the fourth quarter.  The second title from Revolving Games is Skyborne Legacy, a Polygon blockchain-based social world and trading role playing game. The official product announcement is scheduled for October 4.  Other investors in the funding round included prominent Web3 game investor Animoca Brands, Polygon, CryptoKitties developer Dapper Labs and Dan Houser, a former producer at blockbuster game studio Rockstar Games who has joined the Revolving Games advisory board.

The automatic conversion may increase the supply of BUSD by as much as $908 million, as 2% ($898 million) of USDC’s supply and 1% ($10 million) of USDP’s supply are held on Binance, the report said.  Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to another asset, such as the U.S. dollar or gold.  Read more: Binance, Issuer of Third-Biggest Stablecoin, to Stop Supporting Larger Rival USDC  The bank notes that 86%, or $17 billion, of BUSD is held on Binance, which shows that the stablecoin isn't being used regularly throughout the wider crypto ecosystem and therefore, lacks utility, analysts led by Alkesh Shah wrote.  Bank of America sees the potential for a larger increase in BUSD supply over the longer term as exchange users become more familiar with the coin and as applications across add more support for it in an attempt to attract users.  Binance will benefit from this increasing supply because it’s able to invest the additional reserves that will back the stablecoin in cash equivalents such as U.S. Treasurys and overnight loans secured by Treasurys to earn interest income.  The implications for USDC are limited, but there is the potential for the stablecoin to increase its market share relative to tether (USDT), the largest stablecoin by market cap, which was excluded from the automatic conversion, because exchange users may be more likely to convert BUSD into USDC than into USDT when withdrawing funds.  There will likely be a significant increase in stablecoin volumes as the “Web3 ecosystem of decentralized applications develops,” the note added.

Daiwa pointed out that Coinbase (COIN) is one of the largest ETH holders globally, as it holds nearly 15% of all circulating ethereum (ETH-USD) on its platform, according to a note written to clients. In turn, the company &apos;should be a key beneficiary of increased ETH staking demand&apos; after ether (ETH-USD) merges to a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism from Proof-of-Work in the coming days, Daiwa contended. COIN&apos;s total staking revenue is estimated to be $554M in 2023, representing a Y/Y jump of 73%, Daiwa wrote, adding that its staking revenue contribution could increase to 15% in Q4 2023 from 9% in Q2 2022. That would help &apos;the company diversify its revenue away from more-cyclical trading revenue.&apos;Perhaps the intraday upswing in COIN shares was helped by a broad risk-on day in crypto, with bitcoin (BTC-USD) jumping almost 10% to $20.97K, and ether (ETH-USD) perking up 5.2% to $1.70K at the time of writing.

42394805,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASVeCe,1662725123,"Crypto’s S&P 500: CoinDesk Unveils Broad-Market, Digital-Asset Index","CoinDesk on Friday unveiled a new index of digital-asset prices, saying it hopes the broad gauge of crypto markets could become an industry benchmark similar to the stock market’s Dow Jones Industrial Average or Standard & Poor’s 500.  The CoinDesk Market Index initially consists of 148 digital tokens, said Jodie Gunzberg, managing director for CoinDesk Indices. To be included, each token must have a pricing history from at least two eligible exchanges going back at least 30 days.  “It’s meant to be as inclusive as possible,” Gunzberg said in an interview. “We’re just trying to represent the market.”  The new index joins a growing field of competitors aiming to meet demand from investors and traders for ways to measure the crypto market’s performance. Other providers include Bloomberg Galaxy, CF Benchmarks (part of the Kraken exchange), Nasdaq, Solactive, MarketVector, MSCI and S&P.  Traders and money managers use price indexes to evaluate whether they are beating – or getting beaten by – the market. Asset-management companies build investment funds based on indexes; big firms like State Street and BlackRock have built huge businesses selling exchange-traded stock funds based on the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite and other indexes, including for bond and commodity prices.  Customers “would be anybody who’s looking for benchmarking,” Gunzberg said. “That could be people who are looking at measuring performance, generating investment ideas, looking for ways to manage risk, peer group evaluations.”  CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index  CoinDesk’s new index builds on the early success of its Bitcoin Price Index, which the media company added via its 2021 acquisition of TradeBlock, a data and trading platform. (TradeBlock’s operations outside of its index business were spun out of CoinDesk earlier this year, Gunzberg said.)  The CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index – often referred to by its ticker XBX – is the basis for price charts on the CoinDesk website, and it underpins the price-setting mechanisms for at least two big investment funds, the $12.1 billion Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and the roughly $500 million Purpose Bitcoin ETF.  CoinDesk management hopes that licensing fees from the growing index business could become a key source of revenue alongside advertising, sponsorship sales and crypto conferences, especially the flagship Consensus franchise. (CoinDesk is an independent subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, the crypto-focused conglomerate that also owns Grayscale and TradeBlock.)  Gunzberg, who joined CoinDesk in 2021 from Morgan Stanley, said that a key differentiator for the CoinDesk Market Index, or CMI, is that it’s the first in a “family” of nine indexes built around the company’s proprietary classification system for cryptocurrencies, known as the CoinDesk Digital Asset Classification Standard, or DACS.  Crypto taxonomy  The DACS divides about 500 of the biggest digital assets into six categories: currency, smart-contract platform, DeFi (decentralized finance), culture & entertainment, computing and digitization.  So the broad CoinDesk Market Index will come with six sub-indexes, corresponding to each of the DACS categories. Two more sub-indexes will strip out stablecoins “so you can get the full effect of the volatility” of cryptocurrencies that aren’t pegged to government-issued currencies, Gunzberg said. Prior to her stint at Morgan Stanley, Gunzberg was a managing director at S&P Dow Jones Indices.  “What really makes this launch unique is the family of indices, representing not just the broad market but the sectors,” she said. “The first question might be, 'Is the market up or down today?' You might look at the broad market index for the answer. But then you ask, ‘Why, what drove it?’”  The CMI index will be weighted by market capitalization, which means that, at least initially, it’s heavily skewed toward bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), the two biggest cryptocurrencies.  The index will be rebalanced monthly on the second business day of the month, and the number of assets is expected to expand beyond the initial 148, Gunzberg said. The pricing history for the index dates back to Aug. 29, an admittedly short time frame that will also increase “as time passes,” she said.  “That 148 is not a fixed number,” Gunzberg said. “That number is a result of the methodology. I would expect that to grow as the market grows.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/09/09/cryptos-sp-500-coindesk-unveils-broad-market-digital-asset-index,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fef20dc0cfce2d62a747549f85b67b416d5273b0-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Will the uptrend reach $12? The AR prices restart the bullish trend with a reversal from $9.28, resulting in a resistance trendline breakout and a jump of 20% over the last three days. Currently, the bullish engulfing candle of 12.70% with a spike in the trading volume is a trend continuation above the $12 mark. But, will the uptrend sustain above the $12 mark or a bearish reversal is inevitable? Key Points: The AR price action showcases a resistance trendline breakout. The bullish reversal delays the bearish crossover of the 50 and 100-day EMA. The intraday trading volume in Arweave is $30.15 million.

President Emmanuel Macron’s government wants to join the U.K. in handing the police greater power to freeze assets that could otherwise escape their clutches and be laundered away.  “Too often, criminals convert the fruits of their wrongdoing into crypto assets, which can be more easily dispersed and therefore concealed,” said a report annexed to the government’s draft law.  The measures, which largely repeat those first tabled in March, would extend the rules that already apply to conventional bank account holdings to crypto assets. Bank holdings in France can be seized when authorized by a public prosecutor or investigating judge  While much of the bill is dedicated to online crime such as requiring ransomware payments to be reported to the authorities, it covers a range of other issues under French Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin’s purview, such as creating 200 new rural police squads and updating the handling of domestic violence cases.  The proposals will be discussed at a meeting next week by the French Senate’s constitutional law committee, which is responsible for reviewing changes to the country's criminal code.  In the U.K., the government led by Boris Johnson promised new powers to seize and recover crypto assets as part of its Economic Crime Bill in May.

SkyBridge, the investment firm founded by Anthony Scaramucci, who was an aide to former U.S. President Donald Trump, will use some of the funds to buy $40 million in cryptocurrencies to hold on its balance sheet as a long-term investment, the firm said Friday.  Historically, SkyBridge has focused on traditional hedge funds, but it pivoted toward crypto during the last bull cycle, with reports in July that it was planning a Web3-dedicated fund to invest in late-stage crypto companies. According to the reports at the time, an official announcement on the fund is set for Sept. 12 at SkyBridge's annual Salt conference.  The firm also started an investment vehicle to invest in bitcoin (BTC) mining, which raised about $7 million according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Filing in April.  FTX, for its part, has been active in recent months as the crypto market melted down, offering rescues to troubled firms such as lenders Voyager Digital and BlockFi.

The acquisition will mark the latest in a string of deals made by CleanSpark during this year’s crypto winter, which has been particularly tough for miners dealing with higher energy costs and difficult capital markets in addition to the plunging bitcoin (BTC) price.  Read more: Bear Market Could See Some Crypto Miners Turning to M&A for Survival  Earlier this week, CleanSpark purchased 10,000 new Bitmain Antminer S19j Pros for $28 million after credits and discounts – a significant markdown from the manufacturer's listed price. In August, the company acquired another mining facility and bitcoin mining rigs in Georgia from Waha Technologies for about $25 million.  The terms of the Mawson deal have CleanSpark paying $26.5 million in cash and $11 million in common stock, $4.5 million of which is subject to hitting earn-out levels. There’s also $5 million of seller financing consisting of a $3 million promissory note and another $2 million earn-out. The maximum purchase price for the facility and miners is $42.5 million.  “The [Sandersville] site is nothing but impressive – well-run by over 20 dedicated professionals who have taken significant pride in the design, development, and maintenance of the site,” said CleanSpark CEO Zachary Bradford in the statement. “We are enthusiastic about Georgia and believe that our expansion there will continue to build value for our shareholders and the communities we operate in throughout Georgia,” he added.  The deal is expected to add 1.4 exahashes per second (EH/s) to CleanSpark’s computing power before year-end, bringing the company’s hashrate to 5.2 EH/s versus previous guidance of 5.0 EH/s. Another 2.4 EH/s are expected to be added in early 2023 and 7.0 EH/s by the end of next year, according to the release.  The sale has been approved by the boards of both companies and is expected to close in early October. H.C. Wainwright acted as the financial adviser to CleanSpark.  Georgia exit  The completion of the sale means Mawson’s total exit from Georgia, allowing the company to fully focus on development of its Pennsylvania and Texas facilities. Prior to this deal, Mawson had five facilities – four in the U.S. and one in Australia – according to its latest presentation. Sandersville was its largest mining plant, with a planned power capacity of 230 megawatts (MW).  Mawson is not the only miner exiting Georgia. Earlier this month, Compass Mining – a middleman that allows retail investors to participate in bitcoin production – said it was closing two facilities in the state due to rising power costs.  Mawson shares are down nearly 90% this year, underperforming those of CleanSpark, which are down a bit more than 50%.

Rampant energy costs at the facility, which uses electricity bought on the spot market, have eaten into profitability this year. The margin, which stood as high as 74% in January, had sunk to 37% by July. The company is trying to secure a long-term, fixed-price power purchasing agreement to lower its exposure to volatility in energy markets.  ""Spot power prices in West Texas averaged nearly [9 cents] per kWh, which is nearly three times the average price during the month of August in prior years,"" Argo said.  Mining analyst Wolfie Zhao noted on Twitter that under current market conditions, gross margins for even some of the newest mining machines have dropped. According to his calculations, Bitmain Antminer S19Pro and S19XP are down to 44% and 23%, respectively.  Argo also signed an agreement to host up to 32 megawatts of mining machines, around 10,000, according to the statement. The London-based company will receive a quarter of the net profit from mining bitcoin with those machines. Mining firms that don't own and operate their own infrastructure can have their machines hosted at a facility run by a different company.  Argo has been installing its own miners at Helios since it opened in April, but reduced its expectations for its own hashrate, or computing power on the Bitcoin network, for the rest of the year.  The company's shares had gained 9.8% on the London Stock Exchange as of 8:49 UTC.

42394815,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASVeMU,1662711239,Bitcoin Jumps Most in 6 Months as Hopes for 2023 Rate Cut Persist,"Major cryptocurrencies bounced early Friday as traditional market investors shrugged off Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's pro-liquidity tightening stance.  Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency by market value, jumped 8.6% to $20,997 and ether (ETH), the native token of Ethereum's blockchain, which is scheduled to undergo a major technological upgrade next week, rose 4% to $1,705, according to CoinDesk data.  The rally appeared to be touched off by speculation that risky assets, such as stocks and cryptocurrencies, could draw strength from a pivot next year by central banks toward monetary easing as economic conditions worsen and inflation subsides.  MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares except Japan jumped 0.3%. The futures tied to the S&P 500 rose 0.3%, hinting at an extension of a two-day rally, while the European stock futures signaled a positive open. The dollar index dropped 0.7% to 108.80, signaling continued weakness in the greenback.  Bitcoin short squeeze  The rapid price movement led to major trading-position liquidations on crypto exchanges due to margin calls.  In recent weeks many traders had used futures and other contracts to bet that the bitcoin price would drop further – known as ""shorting"" BTC. The sentiment was so negative that analysts argued the setup might be attractive for a short squeeze, CoinDesk reported last week.  So in the past 24 hours, some $101 million of short positions were liquidated as a result of the sudden upswing in price, the most since the June 14 crash, according to data by Coinglass.  Supply chain pressures easing  At a think tank conference Thursday, Powell said, ""We need to act right now – forthrightly, strongly,"" reiterating his commitment to fighting inflation with rapid-fire interest rate hikes. This year, the so-called policy tightening has roiled risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.  However, forward-looking markets focused on leading indicators that signaled the stubbornly high COVID-19 pandemic-era inflation would cool in the coming months, weakening the case for a continued rapid-fire Fed tightening.  ""The bounce is not surprising,"" Ardern said. ""Aside from lead indicators signaling lower inflation, the European Central Bank's decision to hike rates by 75 basis points on Thursday has eliminated a major uncertainty from the market.""  Global container freight rates slipped to 16-month lows early this week, nearly halving from their 2021 peak in a sign of easing supply chain issues.  Freight rates jumped nearly 10-fold last year as the coronavirus pandemic created supply chain problems. That added to the core inflation, which strips out the volatile energy and food component. Powell on Thursday said high inflation was mainly due to the coronavirus.  The U.S. one-year breakeven inflation rate, a market-based measure of expected price pressures over the next 12 months, fell below the Fed's 2% target.  ""We are currently pencilling in a rate cut in June with further easing through the second half of 2023,"" James Knightley, chief international economist at ING., wrote in a market update.  ""With recessionary forces intensifying, we expect inflation to fall relatively swiftly next year thanks to lower gasoline prices feeding through more broadly, weaker wage pressures and declining input costs combined with falling house prices depressing the rental components of consumer price inflation,"" Knightley added.  The Fed has raised rates by 225 basis points (bps) this year and has begun reducing the size of its balance sheet at a monthly pace of $95 billion from this month. The Fed fund futures showed that the central bank would raise rates by 50 bps in November and 25 bps in December, ending the year with the benchmark interest rate in the range of 3.75% to 4%.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/09/09/bitcoin-tops-20k-as-inflation-expectations-slide-hopes-for-2023-rate-cut-persist,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/81a6e6a49b903644d938f80e32d2bc43ec6d27c4-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Crypto mixers are protocols that obscure the destination of tokens making them harder to track.  In August 2021, crypto fundraising platform DAO Maker (not related to Maker DAO) suffered a hack that resulted in the loss of $7 million in various stablecoins and ether (ETH).  Immediately after the 2021 hack, on-chain data shows the funds were sent to two wallets.  One of the wallets sent approximately 3,800 ether ($6.2 million) to Tornado Cash.  The other wallet, which held the balance, remained dormant until today, according to on-chain data.  Earlier this year Tornado Cash was used to mix $15 million in ether, stolen from Singapore-based Crypto.com.  Tornado Cash’s frequent nexus to stolen funds triggered a debate if its complicit in money laundering, with its founder saying that the protocol isn’t controlled by any single entity and is designed to be unstoppable.  In August, the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned Tornado Cash prohibiting all U.S. persons and entities from interacting with the protocol.  Separately, Coinbase (COIN) is sponsoring a lawsuit to try to get the protocol removed from OFAC’s list.",NEGATIVE,DAI,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | DAI,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/09/09/cash-from-2021-dao-maker-crypto-hack-being-mixed-through-tornado-cash,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4346c0accd8eed304203e97ee9920bac654b8de2-1056x740.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin Holds Firm Over $19K  By James Rubin  Bitcoin spent a second consecutive day firmly embedded above its most recent, $19,000 support line.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading over $19,350, nearly a percentage point higher than where it stood 24 hours ago as investors weighed the latest hawkish comments by U.S. Federal Reserve officials. With only a couple of blips, bitcoin has spent much of the past two weeks hovering over $19,000.  Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap and token of the Ethereum blockchain, was recently changing hands above $1,600, up 0.8% from a day earlier. Ethereum's Merge, which will shift the protocol from proof-of-work to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake protocol and has excited investors, is roughly a week away.  Other major altcoins spent much of the day in the green with LINK and SOL recently up more than 8% and 5%, respectively.  Crypto prices followed a recent trend in tracking stocks, which closed higher on Thursday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq, S&P 500, which has a big tech component, and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) all climbed more than a half-percentage point as markets seemed untroubled by the latest statements from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who reiterated the bank's commitment to tame inflation on Thursday at an event organized by the libertarian think tank, the Cato Institute. “History cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy,” Powell said.  The release next week of the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) will show if the Fed has made progress in its inflation fight, although most observers of monetary policy expect the bank to raise interest rates a robust 75 basis points for a third consecutive time. Faced with soaring prices across the continent, the European Central bank on Thursday boosted its rate by this increment for the first time since it it began setting monetary policy in 1999.  In a bad news is good news data point, mortgage rates increased to their highest level in almost 14 years, the latest sign of the sort of cooling economy that the Fed is seeking. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is now approaching 6%, about double where it stood a year ago, a weekly report by mortgage provider Freddie Mac showed.  In crypto news, Powell repeated his position that the Fed does not want to interfere with crypto innovation but that regulation is important. Powell stressed the need for proper regulation of stablecoins if these are to have the properties of money such as clarity, transparency and full reserves. “I don't think you want to take money and make it into just another consumer product where sometimes it fails and sometimes it's good,” he said.  In an interview with CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program, Andre Portilho, head of digital assets at Brazilian financial services firm BTG Pactual, also highlighted the need for smart rules. ""Regulation needs to evolve,"" Portilho said, referring to comments by SEC Chair Gary Gensler who appeared earlier in the program. He added: ""We need actually better regulation and more modern regulation in order for the technology benefits and gains [to] come to the market.

By Sam Reynolds  This summer was a busy one for the enforcement arm of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as it pursued four crypto-related cases that ranged from possibleninsider trading at Coinbase (COIN), to crypto-related Ponzi schemes and the all-time classic ""selling unregistered securities.""  In Asia, regulators are preparing for an equally busy fall with everything from legislation to enforcement action on the table.  Korea  The crypto industry likes to think of itself as being ""everywhere but nowhere."" Register in a friendly jurisdiction and provide service through the worldwide web is the prevailing mantra.  But South Korean authorities don’t like the idea. The Korea Financial Intelligence Unit (KoFIU) is targeting 16 crypto exchanges for conducting “illegal business activities” by operating in Korea without a proper virtual asset service provider (VASP) license.  It's yet to be seen what Korean authorities will do about this. Regulators in Ontario faced a similar situation with KuCoin, which was accused by the OSC of selling unregistered securities to residents of the province.  Seychelles-registered KuCoin is said to have been uncooperative with the investigation, questioning the regulator’s authority over them and ghosting them entirely. Time will tell if they do the same with Korean authorities. Meanwhile, South Korea's Financial Services Commission (FSC), the parent organization of KoFIU, wants crypto legislation fast-tracked through the country’s National Assembly to give it a post-Terra tool kit to deal with the crypto landscape.  There are 13 proposals for new crypto legislation waiting, CoinDesk previously reported, including the country’s upcoming digital asset framework, the Digital Asset Basic Act.  Thailand  Thailand isn’t considered a traditional financial hub in Asia, but its banks and trading community have enthusiastically embraced crypto. Siam Commercial Bank, for instance, has a $50 million blockchain fund and in early 2022 was using Compound to generate yield.  And for a non-financial hub that name isn’t exactly associated with good governance. Its regulator has been proactive in creating a rules-based crypto market that looks to protect consumers. Last year, the regulator banned non-fungible tokens (NFT) and meme tokens from local exchanges as they have “no clear objectives or substance.”  Now, the central bank, in conjunction with the SEC, is set to get a complete regulatory toolkit as lawmakers prepare to debate a crypto framework in the nation’s parliament.  It should be noted that Thai authorities aren’t trying to ban the retail trading of crypto. Thai SEC Secretary-General Ruenvadee Suwanmongkol has been quoted as saying that the commission’s mandate is to “provide more protection for small investors, some of whom are putting most of their savings into these assets.”  This is far removed from Singapore’s approach, which is an outright ban ( although officials say that enforcing such a ban isn’t realistic). For instance, while Thailand regulates retail-focused crypto advertising to ensure that risk disclosures are present and numbers in the adverts are accurate, Singapore bans it entirely.  Thailand regulators are going to have a complicated case in the coming weeks regarding Zipmex, a Thai-based but Singapore-registered exchange that had to temporarily suspend withdrawals earlier this year because of exposure to debt that soured during the broader market downturn.  Thailand’s SEC wants the police to compel Zipmex to hand over key documents. But Zipmex says those documents are contained within its Singapore entity, which is not under the jurisdiction of Thai authorities.  Another case of crypto companies wanting to be everywhere but nowhere.  Singapore  Singapore is the de facto crypto hub of Asia, but regulators in-country aren’t all that comfortable with the term.  They would much rather it be the region’s digital assets hub, a term that encompasses crypto but also includes digitized financial products like security token offerings (STO). Institutional crypto is all right, but retail is a hard no.  “Yes to digital asset innovation, no to cryptocurrency speculation,” is how the director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore put it in a recent speech.  Perhaps part of the hostility regulators have towards crypto is that as a hub, Singapore’s institutions must work through crypto’s biggest problems. Singapore’s judicial system is tasked with helping clean up the mess left behind by Three Arrows Capital. Many of the world’s Web3 projects are registered in Singapore, despite their presence in the city being little more than a post office box or a rented desk at a co-working space. Terraform Labs comes to mind, as does Three Arrows Capital.  As a result, tighter regulations are coming. The Monetary Authority of Singapore is attempting to do a voluntary audit of crypto firms that have a digital payments license to determine how exposed they are to other firms, especially with lending and borrowing.  The exact details of Singapore’s new crypto legislation are expected in the fall, probably around the time of the city’s Token2049 crypto conference.  If there’s a clue to what it might entail, one could look at a recent quote from Ravi Menon, managing director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore.  ""Cryptocurrencies have taken a life of their own outside of the distributed ledger and this is the source of the crypto world’s problems,"" he said during a recent speech.
