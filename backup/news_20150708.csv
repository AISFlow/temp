42398480,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTcDY,1436392522,Do Bitcoin Startups Stand a Chance in Argentina?,"Can bitcoin conquer Argentina?  It's a question that is being given increasing validity by major media outlets like The New York Times and The Economist, and it's easy to see why.  Numerical and anecdotal evidence suggest that if bitcoin will prove popular as a currency anywhere, it should in Argentina.  According to the Bitcoin Market Potential Index (BMPI), which ranks bitcoin's potential utility across 177 countries, Argentina is the most likely country to adopt the digital currency.  It's economy is one of the most problematic globally, boasting annual inflation of approximately 35%. In theory, this means monetary stability in Argentina is particularly weak. In practice, it has led to a thriving black market for alternative means of exchange.  Small, fervent user base  The prominence of bitcoin in Argentina isn't in dispute, with interviewees telling CoinDesk its adoption is comparable to that seen in New York or San Francisco.  Tech entrepreneur Joan Cwaik, for example, estimates Argentina has anywhere from 8,000 to 20,000 bitcoin owners, trading approximately $70,000–$80,000 over-the-counter per day. Wences Casares, founder of bitcoin security company Xapo, recently told CoinDesk that Argentina presented one of the most real-use cases for the digital currency.  But an arguably better question that hasn't emerged amidst the coverage is 'How could bitcoin conquer Argentina?', given that, to expand its user base, the country's entrepreneurs will likely need the tools necessary to develop businesses that can bolster adoption beyond a small, but fervent user base.  Local experts suggest this part of the ecosystem remains, at best, poorly developed, as evidenced by entrepreneur Sebastian Serrano, who admits he had to perform ""several hacks"" to get his bitcoin processing firm BitPagos off the ground – including relocating to San Francisco in a bid to find investors.  Serrano told CoinDesk:  ""In South America, there are a lot of entrepreneurs, but there isn't that many startups. This is something more broad. It's not just bitcoin.""  As noted by Serrano, the Times’s expose on Argentina uncovered ample evidence of this. Its lead protagonist, Dante Castiglione, a bitcoin broker is followed as he hops from office to office exchanging stacks of pesos for bitcoin in what appears to be a thriving small business.  ""He's like a little Coinbase or broker that is not online, but he is basically going places and doing exchanges and that's something very typical,"" Serrano continued. ""If the country wasn't dysfunctional there would be big companies doing that.""  Funding crunch  BitPagos isn't the only startup active in Argentina.  Other notable startups include Bitex.la, SatoshiTango and Unisend, but this handful of companies only account for approximately one-fifth of the latest batch incorporated to San Francisco-based incubator Boost VC, which supported more than 20 bitcoin firms.  Though adoption may be as high as in New York or San Francisco, it's clear that this activity hasn't generated the same interest from local investors.  Carlos Jorge Guberman, head of a research program on economics of cryptocurrencies at Universidad Argentina de la Empresa, described Argentina’s entrepreneurship problem in more general terms, suggesting the funding gap experienced by bitcoin firms is far from unique.  “I think that the lack of funding is a fundamental problem. Argentina has a very small capital market, limited to big companies and banks are prohibited by the central bank from lending to startups,"" he told CoinDesk.  Guberman voiced his belief that the local distrust of banks and financial institutions may have transcended to the venture capital sector, with business owners unwilling to open their operations to capital from institutions.  “There are a few private ... angel investors, there are also a few online funding platforms but they are not that well-known or used,” he added. “Argentina’s financial institutions also result in a series of limitations which can prevent entrepreneurial spirit from flourishing. This has meant that bitcoin has emerged as more of way of evading rate controls instead of people just wanting to take advantage of this fantastic technology,"" he noted.  His perceptions are backed by Practical Law's guide of venture capital law in Argentina. Its assessment, published in 2012, states:  ""Seed capital is typically provided by angel investors, generally relatives or acquaintances of the entrepreneurs.""  Cwaik described the process as of funding procurement as ""long-winded"", suggesting that local bankruptcy and employee rights laws also contribute to the lack of funding.  This is not to say that Argentina's bitcoin startups are not benefitting from large-scale funding. Xapo, perhaps the most well-known bitcoin company connected to the country, has raised $40m in two venture capital rounds. However, although its team hails from Argentina, Xapo based its operations in the US before moving to Switzerland and catering to a global user base.  CoinDesk's venture capital funding records show funding was mostly procured from firms based outside of Argentina's borders.  Entrepreneurial culture  It seems, however, that the apparent lack of venture capital funding has not hampered the country's entrepreneurial spirit.  “Chile has the conditions, Brazil has the market and Argentina has the entrepreneurs,"" noted Juan Martin Rodriguez, executive director at IAE University’s startup programme Naves.  There is no perceived lack of ideas in Argentina, the issue resides in the country's political instability. “There are many potential startups and lots of ideas, many opportunities and a lot of talent among entrepreneurs, in fact they are some of the most qualified in the region, but the political context makes everything harder.”  Rodriguez, however, seemed enthused about possible changes to the socio-political landscape, speaking about what a change in government would mean for the country's entrepreneurs.  Like Rodriguez, Guberman also highlighted the role played by Argentina's business schools in shaping future generations of entrepreneurs.  Despite this, he said entrepreneurs like Xapo CEO and Argentinian native Wences Casares are few and far between.  It's probably safe to say that Argentina could benefit from a viable alternative to fiat currency, to enable its population to evade its crippling annual inflation. Whether bitcoin is the solution to the problem, however, remains to be seen.  Although the digital currency's uptake is seemingly on the rise, the question of whether crypto startups can survive within the country's frontiers remains. The evidence suggests that whilst Argentina is a hot-bed for ideas, it seems the funding necessary to take these ideas to fruition must be procured elsewhere.  Some are hopeful that the upcoming general election, due to take place in October this year, will bring renewed opportunities, perhaps enabling startups to grown and rise in Argentina.

42398483,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTcFW,1436377835,Uber Denies Plans to Accept Bitcoin Payments,"Uber has denied that it is currently integrating bitcoin as a payment option for its on-demand mobile ride-sharing services.      Suspicions regarding a potential announcement first began to circulate on social media yesterday after a user posted a cryptic interaction with one of the company's help desk representatives to Reddit.      The text of the message suggested that Uber was ""currently making bitcoin work"" for the service, but offered few supporting details.      However, a representative for Uber indicated that such assertions were unwarranted, telling CoinDesk flatly: ""This story isn't true.""      Speculation that the company could move to accept bitcoin has emerged periodically from the bitcoin community, including in the weeks preceding the announcement that mobile payments firm Braintree would integrate a bitcoin payments option.      In a further connection between the technology and the company, Uber SVP Emil Michael was named as investor in micropayments startup Neucoin's $1.25m angel round in February.

42398489,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTcNO,1436371854,MovieTickets CEO: Bitcoin Has Boosted Sales and Visibility,"For MovieTickets CEO Joel Cohen, expanding his online movie ticketing company's payment options has been a recent top priority.  Since 2000, MovieTickets has been one of the largest online movie ticketing websites in the US, representing an estimated 240 theater chains. MovieTickets earns revenue by sharing service fee proceeds with theater chains in exchange for managing an e-commerce process that includes accepting major credit cards as its individual theater partners allow.  However, consumers have begun to demand more alternatives such as Visa Checkouthttps://developer.visa.com/visacheckout and MasterPass. With this in mind, MovieTickets was well positioned to expand its payment options to include bitcoin at the request of Open Road Films, the US distributor for independent film Dope, when its creative team sought to use digital currency as a promotional tool.  According to Cohen, although the idea of accepting a digital currency wasn't a priority, it ultimately led to new exposure for his brand. In total, MovieTickets.com now allows movie-goers to purchase tickets to films at more than 900 theaters around the US, and already the firm has seen ""several hundred"" transactions using bitcoin.  Cohen told CoinDesk:  ""I was surprised how well it was embraced and kind of presented in a very positive light. We really got visibility into new audiences.""  MovieTickets is perhaps the most mainstream merchant to begin accepting bitcoin payments for some time, as enthusiasm for the use case has been hampered by less-than-expected user adoption of the technology as an e-commerce tool. The company uses GoCoin as a payment processor.  Cohen went on to suggest that, despite this narrative, the program ""feels like a success"" for MovieTickets, which he argues gained the ability to present itself as an innovative brand.  Education hurdles  For now, Cohen doesn't see the number of movie theaters accepting bitcoin through his platform increasing, though he noted the company is ""always bringing in new theater chains"".  One issue holding back more widespread acceptance, Cohen said, was the steep education process MovieTickets had to engage in with its theater chain partners who ultimately dictate how its consumers can pay at checkout.  ""One of our challenges as we embark on digital currencies is educating the 200-plus theater chains that we work with and getting everyone comfortable. They put the trust in us to accept valid payment options and many were unfamiliar with bitcoin, so it took us explaining what the currency was,"" he explained.  Cohen indicated that this matter was compounded by the lingering associations between digital currencies and illicit activity.  ""The past understandings of bitcoin haven't always been positive,"" he added.  Use cases  As for any use cases for the technology that would be applicable to the MovieTickets business model, Cohen said that the most interesting one was as an online payment method that could drive sales.  ""We're always looking at always to drive ticket sales and it's a valid way of selling tickets, then it just works,"" Cohen said.  Cohen suggested that he does see a limited use for bitcoin at present, given that consumer adoption of the technology remains in its early stages.  However, he suggested that, over time, bitcoin could perhaps grow to be a more generally accepted payment method.  Cohen concluded:  ""It's just like anything else, we need to see people adopt it as generally accepted.""

42398482,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTcEX,1436355766,Japan's Answer to Quora Announces Bitcoin Tipping Scheme,"OKWave, Japan's answer to social network Quora, has announced plans to launch its own bitcoin tipping scheme.  The platform, established in 1999, claims to be the country's largest Q&A site. It announced the news via its blog, which noted:  ""Until now, you could only leave thanks in the comments under your favourite answers, now you can send your gratitude with bitcoin.""  A preview image on OKWave's website suggested users will have to paste in their bitcoin wallet address in order to tip respondents with the digital currency. Currently, users are only able to either up-vote, down-vote or thank users for their answers.  Larger trend  OKWave's announcement sees the company join a growing number of social media platforms who have integrated bitcoin tipping schemes.  Argentina-based Taringa! recently introduced a bitcoin tipping revenue share model – following its partnership with Xapo – to award content creators with digital currency. Meanwhile, ChangeTip is now supported on 12 sites including Facebook, Twitch and Reddit.

42378222,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7N1BN,1436350630,New Jersey Casinos Face Bitcoin Ransom Threats,"Four New Jersey-based online casinos were asked to pay a bitcoin ransom over the weekend, after being hit with distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.  According to the state’s Department of Gaming Enforcement (DGE), cited in a statement published by ABC News, the attacks took place in two stages. An initial DDoS attack was followed by threats of further and more severe attacks if the targeted websites did not complete bitcoin payments.  Agency director David Rebuck said no bitcoin ransom had been paid, but noted the attack ""had the potential to not only negatively impact the targeted casinos but also all business in Atlantic City who share the same ISP provider"".  The DGE did not identify which websites were targeted nor the amount requested in ransom by the perpetrators of the attacks.  Rebuck added that the DGE, the New Jersey State Police, state cybersecurity officials and the US Federal Bureau of Investigation took part in a coordinate mitigation effort that resulted in “no significant disruption to service”.  He noted:  “All involved remain on heightened alert but are relieved that the holiday weekend has passed without incident.""  Wave of attacks  The attack timeline mirrors other attacks conducted by DD4BC, an entity that has been tied to DDoS attacks on bitcoin mining pools and web services in the in the past year and a half, ultimately prompting a warning from government cybersecurity watchdogs in May.  The DGE declined to offer further details or confirm whether DD4BC was involved, citing an ongoing investigation into the attacks.
