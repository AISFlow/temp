42426787,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwixh,1460667710,R3 Reveals 8 Areas of Focus for Blockchain Bank Trials,"A consortium of over 40 financial institutions around the world is currently working on at least eight different proofs-of-concept (PoCs) to show how distributed ledgers can be used to streamline a wide range of transactions on Wall Street – and make them easier to regulate.  Speaking at the Blockchain & Distributed Ledger Conference today, an executive for R3CEV, the startup behind the consortium, listed off eight different areas for which his company was promoting work on proofs-of-concept. These include system interoperability, payments, settlement, trade finance, corporate bonds, repos, swaps, and insurance.  The conference drew a crowd of about 50 regulators, product developers, law enforcement lawyers and other finance industry representatives.  Jacob Farber, general counsel for R3, told attendees:  ""We have groups of financial institutions engaged in proof of concepts or working on scoping the proof of concept in each of those areas""  The comments come after R3 revealed its plans for Corda, a distributed ledger designed with an eye to the specific privacy requirements unique to financial institutions.  Disruption, not replacement  Farber, who previously worked at law firm Perkins Coie – which co-chaired the conference along with American Express – emphasized that the projects in these areas were not intended to replace the entire category in any instance.  Instead, the PoCs will take subsets of the services and try to write them into its distributed ledger.  Specifically, Farber mentioned post-trade reporting, reference data, and regulatory data provision as especially intriguing applications.  ""There’s all sorts of interesting applications on blockchain that are well short of replacing the whole cradle to grave process,"" said Farber.  ""Smart contracts""  In other remarks, Farber took issue with the term “smart contracts,” used to describe legal agreements enshrined into a blockchain, codifying certain obligations that are triggered once a predetermined set of events takes place.  Farber said:  ""People call it smart contracts. It’s a name I hate, because they’re not really contracts [and] they’re not really smart.""  Similarly, in a panel on the subject the previous day, Patrick Murck, fellow at Harvard’s Berkman Center for Internet & Society and former executive director of the bitcoin industry trade group the Bitcoin Foundation, said he “chafes” at the term, coined by Nick Szabo in 1997.  Murck offered the alternative “programmatic transactions”, explaining that the contracts almost always have a traditional counterpart contract, and are only mechanical implementations that are already possible using more traditional technology.  Today was the last day of the two-day conference hosted by the American Conference Institute that spanned a wide range of topics from law enforcement to the position of regulators in the blockchain space to the nature of smart contracts.

42426781,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwdlh,1460664533,Bitcoin Mining Giant Invests $1.6 Million in Trading Platform,"Beijing-based mining giant Bitmain has invested $1.6m in bitcoin-focused data and trading services provider BitKan.  Bitmain  was the sole investor in the Series A round, which follows an angel round investment from Lanqi Venture Capital Investment last November. Based in Shenzhen, BitKan offers bitcoin data and pricing services, and recently launched an over-the-counter (OTC) bitcoin trading service.  Founded in 2013, BitKan was launched by former employees of China-based IT giant Huawei. The firm offers Google Play and iTunes apps, and the startup hopes to leverage its existing reach to encourage trading on its platform.  The firm said in statements that the investment and the new trading feature represent a formal change in the company’s business strategy, one that positions it more as a competitor to existing peer-to-peer bitcoin trading services.  A spokesperson told CoinDesk:  ""The new feature, when leveraging BitKan's existing user base and news and price charting functionality, holds great potential that has already been demonstrated by services with similar functionality such as LocalBitcoins.""  In addition to manufacturing mining hardware, Bitmain also operates Antpool, the world’s largest bitcoin mining pool at press time with 28% of the network’s hashrate.  The investment finds Bitmain becoming increasingly willing to invest its funds in the wider bitcoin ecosystem, following its participation in a March funding round for smart contract platform Rootstock and its February investment in Israeli payments service Simplex.

42426771,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwdRh,1460660045,DTCC CEO Addresses Blockchain Disruption in Annual Shareholder Letter,"In a letter to shareholders, the chief executive of major US clearinghouse DTCC wrote that the company seeks to be ""at the forefront"" of the development of blockchain and distributed ledger applications in the finance space.  President and CEO Michael Bodson wrote in the letter that the company – which recently held a symposium on the technology and is working with industry startup Digital Asset Holdings on a post-trade blockchain trial – wants to play an active role in the exploration and adoption of the technology  Under a subsection entitled ""Embracing Disruption"", Bodson described how DTCC sought counsel with industry stakeholders, going as far as establishing an ""Office of Blockchain Strategies and Research"" to spearhead internal experimentation.  Bodson wrote:  ""We intend to be at the forefront of this issue by helping to spearhead industry experiments and use cases, serving as a leader in the governance of open source, fostering collaboration among market participants and by making strategic investments in partners that can help advance the technology.""  Bodson called the potential presented by the technology a ""once-in-a-generation opportunity"", while at the same time reflecting on the oft-hyped nature of blockchain – a possible nod to a January white paper released by DTCC that aimed to calm expectations at major financials.  ""While the rhetoric may have been overheated at times, the fact is that we are excited by this once-in-a-generation opportunity to reimagine the post-trade infrastructure to address long-standing operational challenges,"" he wrote.  While Bodson did not make specific commitments or announcements in the letter, DTCC has moved in recent weeks to stake its ground in the blockchain space, announcing its partnership with Digital Asset and indicating that it would be open to an evolution of its business model in the face of a shifting technological landscape.

42426772,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwdTh,1460651434,Airbnb: No Bitcoin Plans After Industry Startup Acqui-Hire,"Travel accommodation giant Airbnb has indicated it does not have any plans to incorporate bitcoin into its payment offerings following the acquisition of an unknown number of employees at social tipping startup ChangeCoin.  Airbnb said the employees will be working on the company’s engineering team, with a focus on infrastructure, though it offered no further details. The statements come in the wake of speculation that the purchase is perhaps an indication of the startup's interest in blockchain technology.  However, the firm confirmed it did not acquire assets or intellectual property owned by the startup.  A spokesperson told CoinDesk:  ""We are not acquiring the assets of the company, nor do we have any plans to incorporate bitcoin into the Airbnb ecosystem.""  The company did not comment on whether the employees would be working on applications for blockchain in the wake of comments by Airbnb that hinted at its interest in the emerging technology. Sources said the company acquired mostly employees focused on general product development and based in the San Francisco area.  Representatives from Pantera Capital and Blockchain Capital, two of the company’s investors, reported that an auction is ongoing for the firm’s remaining assets.  No details as to the potential participants in the negotiations were provided.

42426766,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwdJh,1460649598,Digital Currency Exchange ShapeShift Claims Hack Was Inside Job,"Days after disclosing that it had been the target of a hacking incident, digital currency exchange ShapeShift said it now believes the theft was an inside job.  In a post on Reddit, CEO Eric Voorhees stated that the firm had suspected the hack was supported by a former employee, whose name and position was not disclosed.  Voorhees wrote:  ""Since the investigation into the ShapeShift hack last week started, we had suspicion that someone previously on the team was involved, and that this person assisted an outside hacker. We are confident now that is is indeed the case.""  The exchange announced the hack last week, which resulted in the theft of an undisclosed amount from the service's connected wallets.  Voorhees further stated that refunds for pending orders remain held and ""are in the process of being resolved"". When the exchange service announced the hack, Voorhees said that refunds would be processed within 24 hours.  After posting the latest update, Voorhees later wrote that the refunds were being held in a bid to avoid fraud.  The CEO went on to reiterate that a detailed post-mortem of the incident would be published in the future, though he did not offer a specific date beyond ""the appropriate time"".  ShapeShift is currently working with Toronto-based blockchain consultancy Ledger Labs during its investigation of the hack, according to the update.

42426788,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwdth,1460642645,10 Stock and Commodities Exchanges Investigating Blockchain Tech,"While it is often reported that “banks are embracing the blockchain”, such terminology often obscures the wide range of financial institutions that are actively testing the emerging technology.  For example, the DTCC, a major US clearing house that facilitates quadrillions of dollars in annual transactions, and global credit card processing network Visa are just a few of the most notable non-banks to launch pilot projects. That said, some financial sectors are certainly more active than others.  Major stock and commodities exchanges have arguably been among the more active in seeking to investigate blockchain through trials and investments. Major US stock exchange provider Nasdaq, for instance, even launched a blockchain prototype last fall.  Called Linq, it facilitates the trading and tracking of shares in private companies, and is envisioned as an early experiment in how blockchain could expand the reach of major stock exchanges to new asset classes.  Though the use cases vary, 10 major stock and commodities exchanges have so far voiced their enthusiasm for the technology.  Here’s our complete list below:  1. Australian Securities Exchange (ASX)  ASX has been one of the most ambitious firms when it comes to blockchain applications, investing more than $10m in industry startup Digital Asset Holdings in January as part of its R&D efforts.  In conjunction with its investment, ASX also revealed it would seek to go beyond trials of the technology, building a new post-trade settlement system to be developed by Digital Asset using a distributed ledger architecture.  Since January, however, updates on the project have perhaps been overshadowed by controversies at ASX. In March, Australia-based news outlets began speculating that the blockchain project could be in doubt following the untimely resignation of CEO Elmer Funke Kupper, though ASX has since reaffirmed its support for the trial.  2. CME Group  One of the founders of the “Post-Trade Distributed Ledger Working Group”, CME has so far been more active in the industry through its investment arm, CME Ventures.  Unique among its peers, CME Group has pursued a diversified investment strategy across the industry, contributing to funding rounds raised by distributed ledger startup Ripple, blockchain investment conglomerate Digital Currency Group and Digital Asset Holdings.  Combined, the firms represent a significant cross-section of industry activity.  However, apart from these announcements CME Group has yet to speak much publicly on its theses toward the technology and larger industry.  3. Deutsche Börse  The operator of Germany’s Frankfurt Stock Exchange, Deutsche Börse is yet another entrant on this list to have participated in Digital Asset Holdings’ $60m funding round in January.  Unlike its co-contributor ASX, however, Deutsche Börse has been less vocal about its support for the technology.  In a rare interview with CoinDesk in February, Deutsche Börse indicated that it is working on several proof-of-concepts related to the technology, though it has yet to publish any of its findings or test results.  4. Dubai Multi Commodities Centre  In the Middle East, blockchain activity had been notably scarce until the recent unveiling of the Global Blockchain Council, a 32-member consortium of startups, financial firms and tech giants established to review the technology and its impact.  Among these members is the Dubai Multi Commodities Center, a special economic zone and commodities center that oversees trading of precious metals and other tangible goods.  The DMCC announced in February that it was working on a trial of the technology with bitcoin startup BitOasis that explores how blockchain tech could improve its customer onboarding process.  5. Japan Exchange Group (JPX)  One of the more active stock market operators in Asia, Japan Exchange Group announced its interest in the industry in February with the news it had formally partnered with IBM as a user of its Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) offering.  At the time, reports indicated that Japan Exchange Group was now embarking on proofs-of-concept that found it investigating how blockchain tech could be used to create new systems for the trading of low-liquidity assets, with a report on any findings to be released later in the year.  Earlier this month, Japan Exchange Group also announced it is working on trials with Nomura Research Institute (NRI) that would examine how the technology could be applied in the securities markets.  6. Korea Securities Exchange  Korea’s only securities exchange, the Korea Exchange, is one of the newest entrants to the list, announcing it would seek to launch an over-the-counter trading platform using blockchain tech in February.  In statements to local news outlets, the Korea Exchange indicated it is hoping the technology will help reduce costs.  No further details as to the trial, or the firm’s participation in consortium efforts, have been announced.  7. London Stock Exchange (LSE)  One of the founders of the “Post-Trade Distributed Ledger Working Group”, LSE has emerged as one of the most active, yet most quiet companies when it comes to its experiments with blockchain tech.  The working group emerged as one of the first consortiums to follow in the footsteps of startup R3, and served as one of the first indications that major financial firms would seek to leverage collaborative models for blockchain testing that went beyond R3’s framework.  Since then, a number of major financial firms have embarked on private proofs-of-concept along with larger tests involving parties in the operation of certain areas of capital markets.  Further, LSE is one of the initial clients of IBM’s Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) offering alongside Kouvola Innovation and Japan Exchange Group.  8. Nasdaq  Perhaps the most progressive firm when it comes to testing blockchain technology, US stock market operator Nasdaq became the first financial institution to take a blockchain proof-of-concept live when it debuted its private shares trading platform, Linq, in 2015. The platform is currently in beta.  The announcement was the culmination of a significant press push behind the technology, which found Nasdaq unveiling a partnership with blockchain solutions provider Chain, as well as making its internal experts available publicly to speak about the technology.  In 2016, Nasdaq has continued this momentum, revealing it is working to develop a trial with the Nasdaq OMX Tallinn Stock Exchange in Estonia that will find blockchain tech being used as a way to reduce barriers preventing investors from participating in shareholder voting.  9. New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)  One of the earliest firms to signal an interest in the industry, NYSE made two key announcements in 2015, both related to bitcoin.  In January of that year, NYSE invested in bitcoin services firm Coinbase as part of its $75m Series C funding round. At the time, NYSE chairman Jeffrey Sprecher indicated the investment was a vote of confidence that digital currencies could become actively used by millennials, who he described as having more progressive views on value exchange.  NYSE would go on to launch a bitcoin pricing index, a competitor to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), in May, with the index drawing on data from transactions on Coinbase’s exchange platform.  10. TMX Group  The operator of the Toronto Stock Exchange, TMX Group has also been tight-lipped about its interest in blockchain technology.  However, it gave its first public indications in March that it was potentially interested in exploring the technology following its hiring of Anthony Di Iorio, one of the co-founders of the Ethereum project, as its first chief digital officer. The next-generation network has emerged as one of the foremost blockchain applications in the public eye following its production launch in March.  Still, TMX Group has indicated that it is in the early stages of generating a strategy for blockchain, and that it may soon move to conduct tests of the technology.
