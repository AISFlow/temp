11903668,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=527439,1681858806,Arbitrum Soars 44% To Record Highs As Whales Splash Millions On ARB Tokens,"Alongside the rest of the crypto market, Arbitrum, a layer-two scaling solution for Ethereum, has surged by 44% in the past week, reaching major highs. Though the surge can be attributed to the ubiquitous uptrend in the market, the massive whale buying of the token appears to be a contributor to its bullish trend. The buying spree comes weeks after Arbitrum suffered a never-ending fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) in the crypto community. Though the FUD resulted in a plummet in the ARB market, the asset has since rebounded and has picked up a rally. Related Reading: Arbitrum (ARB) Continues Rally Despite Circulating FUD, Here’s Why Whales Buying Frenzy Sends Arbitrum Soaring According to data from Lookonchain, whales have been on a buying spree on Arbitrum native token ARB. Nine whales purchased 12.4 million ARB tokens in the past seven days, equivalent to $21 million. Meanwhile, eleven other whales still hold a huge sum of ARB tokens, and only three sold 22.8 million ARB tokens worth $38 million. The massive buying spree by whales suggests they are bullish on Arbitrum’s potential to revolutionize the Ethereum ecosystem. Arbitrum aims to reduce congestion on the Ethereum network as a scaling solution by enabling faster and cheaper transactions. Its innovative design uses a unique roll-up technology aggregating multiple transactions into a single batch, allowing for faster settlement times and reducing gas fees. The roll-up technology has attracted significant interest from Ethereum developers and enthusiasts, who believe it could help Ethereum scale meet the growing demand for decentralized applications (dApps) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The current bullish sentiment surrounding Arbitrum and ARB tokens suggests that there could be significant gains for early investors. As the Ethereum network continues to grow and evolve, layer-two solutions like Arbitrum will likely become increasingly important, providing a scalable and efficient infrastructure for decentralized applications. Related Reading: ARB Plummets 5% As Arbitrum Presents Draft Of New Governance Proposal ARB Surges 44% In The Past Week After surviving a bearish-filled weekend weeks ago, ARB is currently in the green, up by 44% in the last 7 days. The asset’s price has moved from trading as low as $1.17 on April 10 to trading nearly at $2 with a trading price of $1.72 at the time of writing. ARB is currently up by 6.3% in the last 24 hours. ARB’s market cap has also surged, moving the token rise from ranking at #41 to ranking #32 today in terms of market capitalization among other cryptocurrencies in the global crypto market. In the past 7 days, over $500 million has been added to the asset’s market capitalization. Its market cap currently sits at $2.2 billion, up 38% in the last 7 days. Notably, the massive whale buying indicates smart money is bullish on the project’s prospects. As more developers and users flock to the platform, the demand for ARB tokens is expected to increase.

42394073,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvVl2l,1681856962,What’s in the House Financial Services Committee’s Stablecoin Bill?,"The House Financial Services Committee has finally unveiled its stablecoin legislation, proposing a framework for stablecoin issuers such as Circle and Tether to define how their offerings can be regulated by state and federal entities, while calling for a temporary ban on algorithmic stablecoins.  PS: CoinDesk’s Consensus 2023 conference takes place in Austin, Texas, next week. If you’re interested in attending, here’s a 15% off discount code.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Only regulated issuers, please  The narrative  The House Financial Services Committee (finally) published a long-anticipated discussion draft of its stablecoin bill. In short, the bill would create categories of stablecoin issuers, whether they’re banks or nonbank entities; push for a temporary ban on algorithmic stablecoins, and call for a study of the potential impact from a central bank digital currency.  Why it matters  The stablecoin bill has long been rumored as a piece of bipartisan legislation with genuine support from Reps. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) and Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), then the chair and ranking member of the House Financial Services Committee (they swapped titles after Republicans secured a majority in the House of Representatives). Especially coming after last year’s terraUSD collapse, the bill seemed to have momentum and interest while focusing on a specific subsector within the broader crypto industry.  Breaking it down  The bill creates a definition for “payment stablecoin issuers,” referring to companies behind any stablecoin that’s used specifically for payments or settlements. The issuers themselves must be a state- or federally licensed entity, and could be either insured depository institutions (or a subsidiary of such an entity) or an approved nonbank entity. The issuers would also have to let users redeem their stablecoins within a day of the users seeking a redemption.  Companies hoping to be licensed to issue stablecoins would have to apply with the appropriate regulator, whether at the state or federal level. The regulator would have 45 days to confirm it has everything it needs, and a further 90 days to render a decision. If the regulator doesn’t make a decision, the application would be automatically approved. The regulator would also post the application for public comment.  One of the factors a regulator would have to consider is “The ability of the applicant to maintain reserves backing its payment stablecoins outstanding on an at least one-to-one basis, with reserves comprising of – (i) United States coins and currency (including Federal Reserve notes and circulating notes of Federal Reserve banks and national banks); (ii) Treasury bills with a maturity of 90 days or less; (iii) repurchase agreements with a maturity of 7 days or less that are backed by Treasury bills with a maturity of 90 days or less; or (iv) central bank reserve deposits.”  So, right out of the gate the implications are significant. As Bennett Tomlin points out, the issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin, Tether, would have issues allowing USDT to circulate in the U.S. as the bill is currently drafted.  In a statement, a Tether spokesperson said, “We remain hopeful that stablecoin regulation will provide much-needed clarity for larger corporates, institutions and fintech companies looking to enter the crypto market. As financial regulators address the risks of stablecoins, they should articulate the larger goal of modernizing our payments system and increasing access to the financial system. We believe that greater regulatory clarity will benefit the digital token economy.”  The next few pages of the proposed bill address various requirements to which stablecoin issuers would have to abide. They seem fairly straightforward – customer protection rules, risk management, capital requirement rules, provisions on oversight.  A stablecoin issuer that doesn’t secure a license to operate may face fines as high as $100,000 per day.  Things get really interesting on page 64, section 106, which calls for a two-year moratorium on “endogenously collateralized stablecoins” that aren’t already in existence, referring to stablecoins that are backed by other digital assets or use some other mechanism to maintain their value.  Yeah, remember terraUSD? Pepperidge Farm remembers.  During this moratorium, the Treasury Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and Federal Reserve Board are to study these stablecoins, with the report due within a year of the bill’s passage.  Another section calls for a study on “the potential impact” of a central bank digital currency (CBDC), or digital dollar, on the Fed’s monetary policy tools, U.S. financial sector, banking sector and financial stability, as well as to payment services. The Treasury Department, alongside the various regulators, would have to report to the Financial Services Committee, as well as the Senate Banking Committee, the results of this study within 180 days.  A spokesperson for McHenry said the version published is the same version that was circulating internally among lawmakers last fall. That version does not appear to have been previously made public.  A spokesperson for Senator Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), the chair of the Senate Banking Committee, said stablecoins today “put people’s money and the financial system at risk” in a statement.  “They’re not being used for payments – they’re being used for speculation. Senator Brown is continuing to look carefully at all the different approaches his colleagues have put forward and talk to the regulators. He is committed to putting consumers and the safety and soundness of our financial system first,” the spokesperson said.  Stories you may have missed  Crypto Exchange Bittrex Violated Federal Laws, SEC Charges in Lawsuit: The SEC sued crypto exchange Bittrex, which planned to be done with the U.S. within the next two weeks, alleging it operated a national securities exchange, broker and clearinghouse all at once without registering any of these entities. I think my analysis for the similar Beaxy suit largely holds up so I’ll just link it here. The Bittrex case has more going on – including allegations that more cryptocurrencies are securities, like ALGO and DASH – than Beaxy did, but the main thing is this also does look like it may play a precedent to the pending Coinbase suit.  SEC Advisory Group Backs Gensler’s Crypto Efforts But Asks for Industry Guidance: The SEC Investor Advisory Committee reinforced Chair Gary Gensler’s view that most crypto tokens may be securities, but suggested the regulator provide further guidance on the issue.  Crypto Market Maker DWF Labs’ More Than $200M in Deals Blur What ‘Investing’ Means: DWF seemingly came out of nowhere to invest in a lot of things, some, uhh, sketchier than others.  Ryuk Ransomware Gang’s Crypto Broker Gets Light Sentence After a Guilty Plea: Denis Dubnikov pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to commit money laundering a few months ago after being arrested in The Netherlands and extradited to the U.S. on suspicion of being involved in laundering $400,000 in ransomware proceeds. He’s just been sentenced to time served and $2,000 forfeiture.  SEC Lays Its Cards on the Table With Assertion That DeFi Falls Under Securities Rules: The SEC reopened an existing rulemaking comment period to specify that decentralized finance (DeFi) would fall under its definition of an “exchange.” This may have implications for the industry.

Elsewhere:  (PC Gamer) Riot Platforms, a major bitcoin mining center operator, pushed back against last week’s New York Times article on mining concerns with a written list of issues the company said it had about the article. It then completely undermined its position by revealing the people behind the company either don’t understand or want to pretend they don’t understand the carbon emissions issue (which, in fairness, was also in the written response). More broadly, the crypto industry seems to have taken an opportunity to push back against some questionable editorial choices as an excuse to completely lose its mind. So good job, I guess.  (The New York Times) The Times published a fascinating look at how investigators were able to identify the alleged leaker of national security documents on Discord, a chat app I primarily use to joke about the Ace Combat video game series.  (U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York) A court has signed off on summons for Tron founder Justin Sun, the Tron Foundation and the BitTorrent Foundation tied to ongoing SEC litigation.

As Ethereum bulls double down, the coin has outperformed Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap. ETH is up roughly 15% in the last week of trading versus Bitcoin. Ethereum Outperforming Bitcoin ETH is trading at 0.0708BTC and at a new April 2023 high. Moreover, it is within a bullish breakout formation versus Bitcoin. A notable development in the past few days is the solid break above recent resistance, now support, at around 0.0677BTC on April 14. While the recovery of prices has been impressive, ETH bulls have yet to reverse losses posted against Bitcoin from early March completely. Moreover, for the better part of Q1 2023, Bitcoin bulls had the upper hand against Ethereum. To illustrate, Bitcoin added approximately 20% against Ethereum, with noticeable gains visible in mid-March 2023. Related Reading: Ethereum (ETH) Hits $2,000 Mark Following Shanghai Upgrade Launch In mid-March 2023, there were fears of a banking crisis in the United States. Three banks had collapsed quickly with the bank run of the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), a regional bank, sparking fears. The de-pegging of USDC, a stablecoin, also saw users move their assets to, among other coins, Bitcoin. Furthermore, news that Binance will also purchase BNB, Ethereum, and Bitcoin provided much-needed momentum. Will Bulls Sustain The Uptrend After Shanghai? However, after weeks of underperforming Bitcoin, the tide is beginning to shift in favor of Ethereum. Although recovery can be traced to April 10, the rapid expansion of ETH prices versus Bitcoin is marked on April 14. On this day, the Shanghai Upgrade went live, allowing validators and stakers to withdraw their coins from the Beacon Chain, boosting ETH liquidity. Before the upgrade, on-chain data revealed over $32 billion worth of ETH was locked up in the official deposit address. Interestingly, while some validators and stakers have since withdrawn their coins, the dollar value of assets tied in the Beacon Chain exceeds $39 billion. The expansion could be partly due to the appreciation of ETH prices over the past few trading days, pushing the coin above the $2,000 level. Related Reading: Over 3,000 Validators To Withdraw After Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade Shanghai has completely turned Ethereum into a proof-of-stake platform, with coin holders able to withdraw their assets. Besides Shanghai, the simultaneous update through Capella introduced consensus changes, making the mainnet more secure, performant, and efficient. Whether ETH will continue outperforming Bitcoin in the days ahead remains to be seen for now. However, it is vital for ETH bulls to firmly push above 0.072BTC, or February and March 2023 highs, in a breakout. This could be the base of another leg up towards Q1 2023 highs of 0.078 BTC.

42412237,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl3spe,1681852653,A Mysterious A16z Tweet Sparked a Rally in Crypto Project Optimism's OP Token,"The native token of the Optimism blockchain, OP, rallied after an engineer at the crypto arm of venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) tweeted out a picture of an orange circle, accompanied by “coming soon.”  The color of the circle in the tweet matched that commonly associated with the a16z logo. Earlier this year, Coinbase teased the impending announcement of its Optimism-backed layer 2 network – called Base – by first tweeting out a blue circle.  The similarity of the images led to trader speculation that a16z may have plans to launch its own layer 2 blockchain, sending the OP token about 3% higher.  But Eddy Lazzarin, the chief technology officer of a16z crypto, subsequently tweeted “not an L2,” apparently denying that possibility.  A16z and Paradigm co-led a $150 million funding round for Optimism in March 2022, which valued the Ethereum scaling solution at $1.65 billion.  A16z declined to comment on the speculation when contacted by CoinDesk.

11900825,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=527426,1681851630,Are You Missing Out? 6 Highlights From CoinGecko’s Q1 Crypto Report,"The first quarter of 2023 has been significant for the crypto industry, with the market making a strong comeback after a turbulent end of 2022. According to Coingecko’s first-quarter report, the crypto market has outperformed traditional assets, with Bitcoin leading the charge. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bearish Signal: Exchange Whale Ratio Spikes Crypto – The Best Performing Sector Of The Global Economy The first quarter of 2023 has been an exciting time for the cryptocurrency market, as it started strong with a 48.9% gain in the overall market cap. According to the Coingecko report, the total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies increased from $800 billion to $1.2 trillion in just three months, showing a remarkable recovery from the 2022 turbulence. Along with the growth in market cap, the Coingecko report also highlights the increase in average daily trading volume, which rose by 30% quarter-over-quarter. The report notes that the trading volume peaked in early March, coinciding with the banking crisis that saw several banks collapse due to insolvency. On the same note, Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has outperformed traditional assets like gold and the S&P 500, with a gain of over 70% during Q1 2023. The report attributes this success to several factors, including the increasing acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate investment asset and its growing adoption by institutions and retail investors. Another report highlight is the resurgence of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which saw a significant increase in trading volume during Q1 2023. NFTs are unique digital assets verified on a blockchain, making them unique and valuable. The report suggests that the resurgence in NFT trading volume results from increased interest and adoption of decentralized applications (dApps) and gaming. The Coingecko report also notes the growing popularity of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, which have seen a surge in adoption and usage during Q1 2023, fueled by liquid staking, which led to a rise of 65% for the DeFi market. DeFi protocols are built on blockchain technology and offer users a decentralized alternative to traditional financial services. The report suggests that the growth of DeFi is due to the increasing demand for decentralized services and the potential for high returns. Increased Demand For Stablecoins And DEXs The first quarter of 2023 has seen a surge in crypto spot trading volume, with an 18.1% increase compared to the previous quarter. According to Coingecko, the total spot trading volume reached $2.8 trillion, a significant increase from the previous quarter’s volume. Interestingly, the report notes that decentralized exchanges (DEXs) outpaced centralized exchanges (CEXs) in growth, with DEXs experiencing a larger increase in trading volume than their centralized counterparts. This trend indicates the growing popularity of DeFi protocols, which offer users a more decentralized and transparent alternative to traditional financial services. Despite the increase in trading volume, the report notes that the monthly trading volume has yet to reach the heights of the first half of 2022, where the average monthly trading volume exceeded $1 trillion. However, the report suggests that this is likely due to the market correction and turbulence that occurred in the latter half of 2022, which decreased trading activity. Furthermore, The first quarter of 2023 has seen a shakeup in the stablecoin market, as the top 15 stablecoins shed $6.2 billion in market capitalization. According to Coingecko, stablecoins such as USDC and BUSD experienced the largest declines in market cap, while Tether (USDT) gained dominance with a 20.5% increase in market cap. Overall, the Coingecko Q1 Crypto Industry Report paints a positive picture of the cryptocurrency market, with a strong market cap and trading volume gains. As the industry continues to grow and evolve, it will be interesting to see how these trends develop and what new opportunities and challenges arise.

42412244,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl3suK,1681851102,Lido Considers Using Its ARB Airdrop to Boost Activity on Arbitrum,"Lido DAO community will vote on accepting Abitrum’s airdrop and using the claimed ARB tokens as emission rewards to provide incentive for using wrapped staked ether (wstETH) throughout the Arbitrum ecosystem.  Arbitrum airdropped its governance token ARB in mid-March to reward early adopters of the layer 2 scaling system, which included several decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO), including Lido, that had a hand in the growth and health of Arbitrum.  Now, Lido’s governing community will vote on “operational and strategic topics related to claiming and making productive use of the potential ARB tokens,” according to a proposal submitted April 12 by Lido’s head of decentralized finance (DeFi) business development and partnerships, Justin David Reyes.  Reyes proposes rewarding the ARB tokens to users who provide liquidity for wrapped staked ether pools on Arbitrum. Marketing lead Kasper Rasmussen told CoinDesk the incentives program would work “in the same way [liquidity pools] currently earn additional LDO rewards on top of staking rewards.  The proposal could go to a vote later this week, Rasmussen said.  Lido is eligible to claim 772,621 ARB tokens, worth more than $1.2 million at current prices, according to a Google doc found in Arbitrum Foundation’s governance documents.

11899259,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=527360,1681848007,Glassnode: 8/8 Bitcoin On-Chain Indicators Confirm Recovery From Bear,"8 of 8 Glassnode indicators tracking the recovery progress from the Bitcoin bear market are now displaying green signals. Bitcoin On-Chain Indicators May Suggest The Bear Market Is Behind Us The on-chain analytics firm Glassnode released a “recovering from a Bitcoin bear” dashboard that combines different on-chain indicators to know whether the market is making a healthy and robust recovery from the bear market. “Generally speaking, the behavior of Bitcoin investors has been remarkably consistent over cycles, which allows us to develop tools that find confluence,” explains the firm. Eight metrics are being used here, covering four areas of the BTC market. The first of these areas involves the spot price’s alignment relative to two key pricing models: the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) and realized price. The realized price is an on-chain pricing model that measures the average market investor’s cost basis. Whenever the cryptocurrency breaks above these two pricing models, it’s generally a sign that the market is recovering from a bearish trend. The second area of interest is the state of network utilization. The relevant indicators are the number of new addresses and miners’ fee revenue. When these metrics rise, it means the blockchain is observing more activity, and hence, there is currently higher demand for the coin. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bearish Signal: Exchange Whale Ratio Spikes Profitability-related indicators are the third batch being combined in this dashboard, as they are useful for checking whether the selling pressure has exhausted and whether the market can absorb any sell-side. Finally, there is the topic of long-term holders (LTHs). Bear market bottoms form when these investors get the maximum share of the supply, while recovery happens as the LTHs start spending and new demand flows in to absorb this selling. Now, here is a chart that shows what these indicators are signaling regarding the current state of the Bitcoin sector: Looks like the indicators have lit up in recent days | Source: Glassnode's The Week Onchain - Week 16, 2023 As you can see above, the graph has turned dark recently, suggesting that eight Bitcoin indicators signal recovery from the bear market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply Structure Very Similar To Early 2019, Bull Run Ahead? In the chart, it’s also visible that this signal has held during past cycles as well, as the cryptocurrency’s price has generally gone on to rally after the formation of this pattern. The April 2019 rally, a run that’s quite reminiscent of the current one as it was also a recovery rally out of the bear market lows, saw the formation of this pattern midway through it as well. Based on all these indicators recently entering into the cryptocurrency’s positive territory again, Glassnode believes “the Bitcoin bear could very well be behind us.” BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $30,200, up 1% in the last week.

Rocket Pool’s recent upgrade gives node operators immediate access to their staking rewards and lowers the barrier of entry to spin up an Ethereum validator, or “minipool,” in the protocol’s parlance. Instead of providing 16 ether (ETH), node operators can supply just eight plus some RPL – Rocket Pool’s governance token – to form a minipool, decreasing the amount of capital required to participate in Ethereum’s staking process.  “Minipools with only 8 ETH bonded by their owning node operator are matched with 24 ETH from the staking pool (provided by rETH holders) in order to make a validator,” according to Rocket Pool documents.  RPL has rallied almost 30% to $55.37 in the six days since Shapella, per CoinGecko.

""Right now, this market is rife with noncompliance,"" Gensler said in his testimony before the House of Representatives Committee on Financial Services. ""This not only puts investors at risk, but also puts at risk the public's trust in our capital markets."" The SEC is currently taking public comments on its proposed rule for regulating cryptos, which was reopened last week to include the requirement of registering crypto exchanges and DeFi platforms. ""Calling yourself a DeFi platform is not an excuse to defy securities laws,"" said Gensler in his testimony . Prior to the hearing, Republicans on the committee - led by Chairman Patrick McHenry (R-NC) - sent a letter to Gensler, in which they slammed the SEC's approach to regulating cryptos and its insistence on crypto exchanges registering under the ""ill-fitting"" national securities exchange framework. ""You have been outspoken in your push for digital asset trading platforms to 'come in and register' under the NSE framework,"" the letter read. ""Yet, at the same time, you failed to provide a path that allows these platforms to register."" The representatives insisted that the SEC was to blame for the lack of registrants.

42412253,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl3t0s,1681844534,Crypto Companies May Use a Supreme Court Doctrine to Push Back Against SEC: Lawyer,"The U.S. Supreme Court might provide crypto companies with a way to fight the Securities and Exchange Commission in court, according to Jason Gottlieb, a partner at law firm Morrison Cohen LLP.  At a time when the SEC is widening its view of what it considers a ""security"" and thus subject to its regulatory oversight, “We’re going to see crypto companies trying to push back against the SEC,” Gottlieb told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” on Tuesday.  In March, the SEC charged crypto exchange Bittrex with violating federal laws. The exchange, which plans to close its U.S. platform on April 30, said it would take the regulator to court if the agency did not make a “reasonable settlement offer.”  Gottlieb said crypto companies may try to hold off the SEC using the U.S. Supreme Court’s ""major questions doctrine,"" which holds that regulators can’t exceed their authority. The high court last used the doctrine in 2022 in a 6-3 decision involving the Environmental Protection Agency on whether it had the authority to issue an emissions cap on greenhouse gases.  Chief Justice John Roberts, writing for the majority, said no, and that it was up to Congress to provide EPA with clear authorization for such actions.  “What the Supreme Court has instructed is that administrative agencies, which are a branch of the executive department, are not allowed to take views that will affect major questions of the United States economy,” Gottlieb said.  So when it comes to crypto, “That’s for Congress to set the law, not for the SEC to say 'we believe the law should be no crypto,'” he added.  The U.S. approach to crypto – or lack thereof – is going to have a big effect on this country’s economic and financial competitiveness. Consider other jurisdictions, Gottlieb said, such as the European Union, the U.K., Singapore, Japan and the Cayman Islands, which “are developing legal regimes that can allow people to operate legally.”  While these regimes may not be perfect, and are likely to have advantages and disadvantages, Gottlieb said that, unlike the U.S., they all have “a clear path [for a crypto company] to operate legally.”  On Tuesday, during Fintech Week in London, CEO Brian Armstrong of Coinbase, the largest U.S.-based crypto exchange, said the exchange could consider moving offshore if the regulatory environment for the crypto industry does not become more clear.  That isn’t the approach all crypto companies are taking, Gottlieb said. Hs crypto clients are asking him what can be done to operate legally in the U.S., or as close as possible to legal given the ambiguities, he said.  “We try to tell our clients as best we can what the law requires [and] what regulators require,” he said. “And sometimes, we have to tell you, sorry, it can’t happen here.”  See also: Coinbase Could Move Away From U.S. if No Regulatory Clarity: CEO Brian Armstrong  CORRECTION (April 19, 2023, 0:34 UTC): Changes multiple references from Cohen to Gottlieb.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/04/18/crypto-companies-may-use-a-supreme-court-doctrine-to-push-back-against-sec-lawyer,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d4294a46caf9fde4897876f52970814b0f6afd4b-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42412259,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl3t4c,1681842532,Ethereum Unstaking Requests Now Face About a 17-Day Wait,"The line is getting longer: Ethereum validators that have put in withdrawal requests following last week's Shanghai upgrade will have to wait upwards of 17 days to get their staked ether (ETH) back, according to data from the blockchain analytics firm, Nansen.  That’s up from about 14 days late last week.  The unstaking request queue consists of some 28,436 validators looking to exit the Beacon Chain.  There are a total of 575,359 validators on the Ethereum blockchain, according to analytics firm Nansen, so roughly 5% of validators are choosing to leave Ethereum’s staking process. Validators are responsible for proposing and adding blocks of transactions to the Ethereum blockchain as part of the validation process. In return, they are eligible for rewards of newly minted ETH and a share of associated transactions fees.  But for those who have chosen to exit, there’s a whole process that contributes to the length of the queue.  According to Niklas Polk, an analyst at Nansen, validators first send a voluntary message to exit, involving a 25-minute wait. Then these validators join the exit queue, which now sits at 11.7 days. Once they move out of this phase, they are faced with a withdrawal delay of about 27 hours. Finally, withdrawals are processed and deposited after another 4.25 days.  In short, this means that if a validator decides to join the exit queue today, it will be 17 days by the time their ETH is returned.  On the other hand, partial withdrawals only take about 4.27 days to process and are automatically deposited into validator addresses if their unstaking credentials are set up. A partial withdrawal means the validator is only withdrawing a portion of their staking rewards while keeping their staked ETH in play as part of the validating process.  Staking ETH is still gaining popularity  The developers behind the Ethereum blockchain have won plaudits for the mostly smooth execution of the network’s multi-year transition to a fully functional proof-of-stake network, from the more energy-intensive proof-of-work system its used originally, and which Bitcoin still uses.  And while crypto analysts have said that the ability to withdraw from the staking mechanism might make investors less reluctant to allocate capital toward staking, the length of the Ethereum exit queue has provided a stark reminder of just how long it can take to get the crypto back at a time of high demand – especially in fast-moving digital-asset markets where prices can and often do move by double-digit percentages in a single day.  According to Nansen, Kraken, the crypto exchange that was forced to shut down its staking service in a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, makes up about 43% of the ETH withdrawal queue.  Concurrently, stakers over the last 24 hours have deposited more ETH into the chain than there have been withdrawal requests, creating a net 86,000 ETH staked, or 0.3% increase in staked ETH – despite all the withdrawals that have already taken place. This shows that since the upgrade, stakers have gained confidence in Ethereum’s staking process.  Over 1 million ETH has been unstaked since Ethereum’s upgrade.  (The net ETH staked figure does not account for tokens due to be withdrawn by exiting validators that are still waiting in the queue.)

BLOK invests in stocks focused on blockchain technology, many of which happen to be involved in cryptocurrency. I’m bullish on blockchain and bearish on cryptocurrency, and I believe blockchain has potential in many industries that don’t involve crypto as the world becomes increasingly technology-oriented. The Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF ( BLOK ) is in many ways the mother of blockchain funds. Blockchain was originally created for the purpose of recording cryptocurrency transitions, but has recently shown to be potentially integral in industries with no involvement in crypto. Blockchain’s underlying infrastructure is creative and has shown to be effective, which is why I believe more firms may capitalize on this technology in the future. Adoption of blockchain technology could increase companies’ profits in the long-term through reducing transaction costs as well as enhancing the efficiency and transparency of transactions. However, these long-term prospects do not change the fact that BLOK is very volatile and attaining long-term profits could require some serious trust and self-control. This leads me to take a neutral stance with this ETF and rate it a Hold. BLOK’s price trend since its inception in 2018 resembles that of a roller coaster that drives one up into the air only to send them plunging down moments later, then repeating this several times until the rider is sick to their stomach. In this case, the rider is an investor, and the roller coaster's next steep incline or drop are quite hard to predict. That being said, just like someone with a weak stomach shouldn’t ride an adrenaline-pumping roller coaster, investors with limited risk-tolerance might want to stay away from BLOK. ETF Profile Strategy BLOK tracks the MSCI ACWI NR USD Index. This index’s selections and weighting are determined by the results of proprietary research. This ETF also strongly overweights small cap companies, giving it a small tilt compared to its benchmark. BLOK MSCI FaCS and Factor Box (etf.com) In determining the weight of each holdings in this ETF, companies are first assessed on their involvement in the utilization and development of blockchain technology. Criteria include the degree of participation in research and development of transformational data sharing technology as well as their ability to profit from its expansion. Furthermore, companies are also noted for having partnerships and affiliations with companies focused on blockchain. Qualifying companies are then classified as either core or secondary based on their forecasted ability to derive revenue from blockchain expansion and hence drive the price of BLOK. BLOK is also actively managed, meaning that its management will periodically adjust weightings to ensure that this ETF is optimally-positioned for growth amid various external conditions. Holdings Analysis BLOK’s holdings mainly reside within the sectors of technology and financials, sparing only a fifth of holdings to companies not affiliated with these sectors. Companies within this ETF are predominantly located in the United States. BLOK also represents non-U.S. regions like Japan and Canada which account for almost a third of geographical composition. This composition enhances geographical diversification but can also create currency risk, both of which investors may want to keep in mind. Institutions within BLOK are mainly centered on the development and utilization of blockchain-based transformational data sharing systems. The top 10 holdings account for 43% of the entire fund while the top 25 comprise 81%. Given that this ETF consists of 46 holdings, BLOK could be considered decently top heavy, meaning investors might want to consider relevant concentration risks. ETF Fundamentals: Underlying Factors Strengths BLOK may provide quality exposure to the blockchain market, which could be well-positioned for growth in the upcoming periods. The global blockchain market could reach almost $165B in revenue by 2029, growing at a CAGR of 56%. The chart below depicts the market forecast for blockchain in North America alone. North America Blockchain Market Size, 2018-2029 (USD Billion) (Fortune Business Insights ) Blockchain could have some serious momentum that could earn greater recognition with time, making BLOK a potentially attractive investment for those bullish on technology and finance. BLOK’s relatively high AUM and longer track record distinguish it from many of its peers and could give it an edge in the long run. Blockchain itself is a pretty nascent invention whose popularity surged only within the last 5-10 years. As a result, the blockchain ETF market is home to a lot of smaller funds with more fundamental liquidity issues. As these are BLOK’s competitors, this ETF’s higher liquidity and more developed grounding could make it a more compelling investment. Weaknesses BLOK’s higher AUM could grant it some power over its peers, but this ETF’s overweighting of small-cap stocks could bring its own detrimental implications. I’ve previously addressed how small-cap companies could grant advantages during a market reversal as they provide exposure to early stages of long-term growth. However, small-cap overweighting is also associated with greater volatility and larger price fluctuations, which are apparent in this fund. This ETF also underweights stocks characterized by momentum, quality, and low volatility. These qualities could explain BLOK’s erratic movement relative to that of the S&P, which is visualized later in this article. Furthermore, this ETF’s turnover is somewhat high, which could shed light on its high costs, lack of transparency, and possible susceptibility to tracking error. Seeking Alpha Past Performance And Future Implications BLOK Vs. The S&P: Powered By Speculation and Hype BLOK exploded in price a couple years after its inception, only to one year later incur a greater decline than that of any ETF I have covered thus far. Such erratic performance is likely attributable to BLOK’s investments in companies involved in the mining and trade of cryptocurrency, particularly Bitcoin USD ( BTC-USD ). Data by YCharts From the chart, it is apparent that his ETF is highly volatile, just like cryptocurrencies themselves. Therefore, BLOK is likely vulnerable to the effects of hype and speculation that mainly surround crypto. During the last year, not only has this ETF underperformed against the broader market, but its performance is highly inconsistent and moving choppily. Data by YCharts The same case appears to only get worse when narrowing in on the last six months. Data by YCharts On a different note, BLOK appears to be outperforming the broader market so far this year, but its price trend is still far from steady. Data by YCharts BLOK has clearly picked up some momentum this year. However, this ETF’s past performance combined with the generally volatile tendencies of crypto make me question whether this momentum is actually warranted or just fueled by trigger-happy speculators. BLOK Vs. Peers During the past year, BLOK has outperformed some of its potential alternatives, but is still an inferior option in several respects. Data by YCharts As depicted in the chart above, this ETF outperformed the Global X Blockchain ETF ( BKCH ) and the iShares Blockchain and Tech ETF ( IBLC ), showing that it may have some advantages against other funds with a similar focus. However, BLOK also may have some underlying disadvantages against the First Trust Indxx Innovative Transaction & Process ETF ( LEGR ), which it appears to underperform against. This performance gap is likely attributable to LEGR’s relatively lesser expenses and risks while offering many of the same benefits as the more volatile BLOK. What Is Next For Blockchain And BLOK? Opportunities Blockchain could encounter many new opportunities for expansion in the coming periods as non-crypto companies become more dependent on technological innovation. Expansion targets may include but are not limited to healthcare , finance , and supply chain management. I could see more companies within these fields adopting blockchain technology with time, which could ultimately drive up the price of BLOK. Though investors could be in for some serious price fluctuations along the way, holding this ETF may generate significant returns with patience. Threats Innovations like blockchain are great but also create a lot of new potential targets for hackers . Blockchain in particular opens several doors to certain kinds of cyberattacks that are left closed by other technological systems. Blockchain is uniquely vulnerable to 51% attacks which occur when a hacker gains ownership of more than half of the nodes within a network, allowing them to manipulate blockchain data as they please. This could mean reversing previous transactions as well as preventing future transactions from processing. Such attacks increasing as blockchain grows could potentially hurt the profits of BLOK by demanding heavy theft reparations expenses and diminishing trust in blockchain technology. Blockchain’s services could extend beyond crypto with time, but BLOK is still heavily exposed to crypto stocks that are weighed down by their volatility. In short, blockchain can exist without crypto, but it’s harder to see crypto existing without blockchain as crypto today is so heavily dependent on it. On this same note, I think the prices of crypto may well decline in the long-term. This could result from more investors realizing that cryptocurrencies aren’t that sound of an investment and pose numerous downsides to traditional investment vehicles like stocks, bonds, and real estate. Conclusion BLOK could well profit in the coming periods from ongoing developments in the realm of technology, but its volatility and crypto-focus could hinder both its stability and overall performance down the road. For this reason, I rate BLOK a Hold. As interesting as blockchain is to research, this ETF seems to be more unpredictable than any I have covered thus far. Therefore, I believe its audience may be limited to those with high tolerance to price fluctuations. Blockchain could nonetheless go far and benefit those who utilize its technology, but those eager to tag along on this journey may be in for a very bumpy ride.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4594767-blok-society-yet-to-tap-into-blockchain-potential-outside-cryptocurrency?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/11896852.jpeg

11896547,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=527239,1681840828,Aptos Price Prediction: Is APT On The Verge Of A Major Breakout?,"As the world of cryptocurrency continues to evolve and expand. Investors are always on the lookout for the next big thing. One emerging player in the crypto space is Aptos (APT), a decentralized platform that aims to revolutionize the way we think about digital identity and security. But what is the future of APT? And what can we expect from its price in the coming months and years? A Run Down On Aptos Firstly, to take a closer look at the technology behind Aptos. At its core, Aptos is a blockchain-based platform enabling users to create and manage their decentralized digital identities. Users can use these identities to access various services and applications, from online shopping to financial transactions, all without needing a central authority or third-party intermediary. Related Reading: Aptos (APT) Rises 21% In A Week As Launch Of Web 3 Game Draws Closer One of the key benefits of Aptos is its focus on privacy and security. With Aptos, users can be assured that their data is kept secure and private, thanks to advanced encryption and decentralized storage mechanisms. This makes it an attractive solution for anyone concerned about centralized data breaches and identity theft risks. However, what about the price of APT? APT is trading at around $12 per token, with a market capitalization of just above $2 billion, ranking 31st in the global crypto market. While this may seem like a small figure compared to more established cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), it’s worth noting that APT has only been trading for the past 4 months, and is still very much in its early stages of development. What Does The Future Hold For APT? While no one can predict the future of any cryptocurrency with complete accuracy, a few factors suggest APT could be on the verge of a major breakout. Firstly, there is growing interest in and adoption of decentralized identity solutions like Aptos. As more individuals and organizations become aware of the benefits of decentralized digital identities, it’s likely that demand for APT will increase. Additionally, APT’s chart shows a possible uptrend that could occur soon. On the 1-day time frame, the asset has formed a double bottom and is now set to shape a W pattern fully. Aptos has a major high liquidity, just above $14. Should APT continue its upward momentum and not invalidate the W pattern. APT could trade above $14 in the coming days. Besides that, the asset has an all-time high of $19.92. APT still has some major highs indicating liquidity is readily available. Notably, APT could validate the above setup and show possible signs for more rallies. The asset could still tap highs at $16.7 and above $20. Meanwhile, Aptos has several features, such as its unique consensus algorithm and Proof of Assignment (PoA). This makes it an attractive solution for anyone looking for a more sustainable and eco-friendly alternative to traditional blockchain platforms. Related Reading: 4.5 Million Aptos To Be Released Into Circulation On Wednesday, What This Means For APT Though there are also risks and challenges associated with investing in APT. However, as a relatively new and untested cryptocurrency, there is always the possibility of volatility and market fluctuations. Additionally, there is the risk of competition from other decentralized identity solutions in the market. Regardless, it is worth noting that Aptos ( APT) is an emerging cryptocurrency with much potential. While there are no guarantees in the world of crypto investing. The platform’s focus on privacy, security, and sustainability, combined with growing interest and adoption, suggests that APT could be on the verge of a major breakout in the coming months and years.

42394068,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvVkd7,1681839254,"If Crypto OGs Are Being Hacked, Where Does That Leave the Rest of Us?","There’s reportedly been a nasty bug going around OG crypto holders, notably affecting one of the most critical parts of Web3 infrastructure: the MetaMask wallet. Over 5,000 ether (ETH) worth about $10.5 million have been stolen from crypto veterans using a variety of non-custodial wallets since December, crypto-skeptical news site Protos reported, citing an informal investigation done by MyCrypto founder Taylor Monahan.  It appears that developers at ConsenSys, the private blockchain software firm that’s built much of Ethereum’s open-source tooling, including the MetaMask wallet and Infura application toolkit, are investigating the exploit, which appears to be “deliberately” targeting people who should know the ins and outs of crypto self-custody and security.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  “This is NOT a low-brow phishing site or a random scammer. It has NOT rekt a single noob. It ONLY rekts OGs,” Monahan, who goes by “Tay” on Twitter, wrote. The attack is widespread, affecting keys created between 2014 and 2022 and at least 11 blockchains, according to Tay’s preliminary investigation. Monahan's on-chain sleuthing has found the unexplained vulnerability may impact ""all wallets,"" including but not limited to MetaMask.  I mention this exploit not to spread fear, uncertainty and doubt – especially not about the most-used Web3 portal. As of now, it appears average or occasional users of MetaMask, or crypto users generally, aren’t being targeted. But it is a moment to remember a few wallet best practices and to take stock of your holdings. Because of the far-reaching nature of the attack and the pedigree of the victims, the fallout could be severe.  The most important thing now is not only making everyday crypto users feel safe and secure, but ensuring they actually are. In an email, a ConsenSys representative confirmed that the attack seems to be targeting early ETH adopters or people who work in the industry – or at least are active enough to be called ""crypto native."" Further, the representative stressed the attack stretches well beyond just MetaMask, and that the hacker's ""on-chain behavior heavily suggests a private key compromise.""  ""What current investigations are showing is that it seems that this specific attack vector is pointing towards these users’ secret recovery phrases being compromised somewhere down the line, likely due to unintentionally insecure storage of said phrase,"" the MetaMask security team said.  The unknown attacker(s)  As mentioned, much about the attack and attacker(s) are still unknown. It’s not clear whether this is a coordinated effort by several skilled hackers or a lone actor, or whether multiple individuals found and are exploiting the same vulnerabilities. That said, the fact that most of the attacks have taken place between 10:00-13:00 UTC, according to Monahan, suggests it may be a single entity that received highly compromising information.  In her write-up, Monahan said the perpetrator may have received a cache of data that is helping him or her gain access to users’ private keys or wallet recovery phrases. She added emphatically that the issue is not related to MetaMask’s underlying cryptography and is not a social-engineering scam, as with phishing.  However, there are a few commonalities with the exploit: Most attacks have occurred on the weekend, and the exploiter swapped assets within a victim’s wallet for ether (often bypassing staked positions, non-fungible tokens and lesser-known coins), consolidating that ETH and then transferring it out. Often the attacker has gone back hours, days or weeks after an initial attack to sweep remaining funds, Monahan said.  The “theft and post-theft on-chain movement is VERY distinct,” Monahan said, hoping to open the doors to identifying the attacker and recovering assets. She added that several “recovery” attempts have been successful so far.  ConsenSys confirmed the attack over email, and said it encourages people to contact its support team ""about any specific case."" The firm acquired Monahan’s startup MyCrypto in February 2022, having implemented MyCrypto’s “scam blocklist” (aka CryptoScamDB), which was used to protect MetaMask users from visiting known scam URLs in 2017, according to an announcement at the time.  Both Monahan and ConsenSys are also stressing the importance of mutual collaboration at the time, and the sharing of information and resources. Unfortunately, the crypto community has an ugly habit of victim blaming people who are hacked. ""Stop shaming ppl. They aren't stupid,"" Monahan wrote, noting how if your were hacked sharing details publicly can help the distributed, Web3 hive mind find a solution.  ""Web3 belongs to everyone and we should all try to keep each other safe,"" the ConsenSys rep said.  Best practices  As for best practices, Monahan wrote in all caps: “PLEASE DON'T KEEP ALL YOUR ASSETS IN A SINGLE KEY OR SECRET PHRASE FOR YEARS.” If that is mostly useful only in retrospect, she also cautions users to split up their assets, use a hardware wallet and migrate their funds off accounts connected to the internet. Further, the MetaMask shared this bulleted list:  Never store your private key or secret recovery phrase anywhere online, always write it down somewhere and keep it safe  Get and use a hardware wallet, but just like with MetaMask, don’t store your private key or secret recovery phrase anywhere onlinee (or realistically, in any internet-enabled device)  If you ever get to the point where your wallet is so old that you can’t remember if you’ve been 100% diligent with its keys at all times, then consider creating a new wallet (which means a new secret recovery phrase, not a new account) and migrating your funds there  Perform regular security checks and audits to ensure that you’re up to speed with the best security practices and just as [Monahan] mentioned, consider splitting up your assets across multiple recovery phrases, and using hardware wallets  As the nature of the exploit is revealed, it’s likely this story will get only bigger. Apparently, many longtime crypto users have been affected over a period of months without much word filtering out into the wider world. As long as crypto continues to have value, wallet users will continue to face such threats. A record $3.8 billion in crypto was stolen last year through scams, hacks and theft, according to Chainalysis’ latest accounting.  CoinDesk recently published a list of “Projects to Watch,” meaning protocols and companies we feel relatively good about recommending to users. I wrote about the increasingly popular Rainbow wallet, which is spreading mostly by word of mouth, in part because of its easy interface and built-in security features.  See also: PayPal Working With Crypto Wallet MetaMask to Offer Easy Crypto Trading  Rainbow, like many crypto wallets, has rolled out a series of security features to help protect wallets including pop-up messages that warn users about suspicious addresses they may be interacting with, as well as ID tools to prevent people from sending assets to incorrect or dead addresses. Basic security features like this should be the norm across crypto (to be clear, MetaMask is among the wallets with similar protections).  But it also seems like crypto users and malicious actors will constantly be playing a game of cat and mouse. With every technological advancement released to protect the uninformed, there is likely a workaround. And if Monahan is correct, even years of hands-on experience is no guarantee you will be safe. There are best practices to follow and pitfalls to avoid – but at this point, scamming is clearly endemic to crypto.  Where does that leave Web3? It’s not like banks or fintech apps are immune to hacks or scammers – but users should be able to trust even “trustless” technologies.

Still, it's ""difficult to imagine a world where the tradeoffs between benefits and unintended consequences could justify a direct access CBDC for uses beyond interbank and wholesale transactions,"" she said in a prepared speech at Georgetown University, citing financial stability risks and the potential intrusion on users' privacy. While the U.S. has not yet created a CBDC -- a central bank-issued digital currency representing a nation's fiat currency -- both the Biden administration and the Federal Reserve have been assessing the potential risks and benefits since last year. The Fed has previously said it would seek approval from Congress before implementing a CBDC. In her remarks, Bowman casted doubts on the need for a digital U.S. dollar, as “the risk that a CBDC would provide not only a window into, but potentially an impediment to, the freedom Americans enjoy in choosing how money and resources are used and invested.” Also, a CBDC that pays interest could potentially limit banks' ability to lend and ""increase the cost of capital across the economy,"" she warned . ""It would be irresponsible to undermine the traditional banking system by introducing a CBDC without appropriate guardrails to mitigate these potential impacts on the banking sector and the financial system.""

While the tokens will be minted on the Polygon blockchain and remain at their original mint price of $99, the art, rarity traits and utility features will differ from the first collection. For starters, Series 2 includes 47,000 non-fungible tokens – 2,000 more than the first series. That could be a nod to his ambition to return to the White House as the 47th president.  According to the Trump Digital Trading Card website, no 10 tokens will have the same features.

""The Committee is working with the Debtors to evaluate all options to reboot or sell the FTX exchanges and create value for creditors,"" FTX creditors' committee tweeted on Tuesday, adding that there isn't a set timeline for a reboot or sale at this time.  John J. Ray III, the current chief of FTX, told the Wall Street Journal in January that the estate is exploring restarting the crypto exchange – something the firm's attorneys repeated earlier this month.  ""Until a formal process is launched, parties interested in purchasing or sponsoring a reboot of the FTX exchanges should contact the Debtors and the Committee,"" the creditors' committee tweeted.  FTX's exchange token FTT jumped as much as 23% on news of the Tribe Capital bid, and was higher by 17% at press time.  Tribe Capital and FTX debtors declined to comment on the matter.

Its price performance in 2023 has been impressive, from $5.6224 on January 1, 2023, to its current price of $8.68. Despite price volatility, LINK has reclaimed the $8 price level and is currently in an uptrend. Chainlink Sustains Its Uptrend As It Consolidates Above $8 LINK spiked from $7.7524 on April 14 to $8.1033 on April 15. It has remained above $8 for the last three days recording new highs on the price chart. Related Reading: Not So Fast: Bitcoin Strength Fails To Breach This Key Bullish Level Also, its trading volume has spiked by over 28% within 24 hours, which could be the reason behind its current price surge. LINK has recorded a 5.87% price increase within 24 hours, which could signal the continuation of its rally. It is trading above its 7-day high of $8.4753, sparking a bullish revival as it seeks to continue its ascent. Recent developmental activities on its network, such as the increase in smart contract use cases, contribute positively to its price action. Also, the upcoming Hackathon Spring 2023, a community-based event, generates positive publicity for the asset. Such activities and other fruitful partnerships have transformed LINK into a hub of developmental activity. The increased on-chain activity is also one of the factors lending support to the current price trend. Will We See Further Increase Above $9? Chainlink is trading in an uptrend forming a long green candle on the daily chart today. It has posted its sixth consecutive green day, confirming the prevalent bullish trend in the market. LINK is above its 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA), a bullish sentiment for the short and long term. It implies that the bulls are still in control and will keep pushing the price. It is trading in the upper region of the Donchian channel, which also confirms the bullish trend.

Developers supporting the network have initiated a 24-hour process that will kick the Helium blockchain offline and recreate its key metrics on Solana. Helium’s smart contracts will be unusable during the transition, but if all goes according to plan the network will start back up again Wednesday.  The transition aims to make it faster and cheaper to operate on Helium, a project attempting to globally deploy decentralized wireless infrastructure that relies on cryptocurrency as an incentive mechanism. Until Tuesday its tokens lived for nearly four years on the Helium blockchain, a custom layer 1 that lacked the broad appeal of Solana, Ethereum and other smart contract platforms  Moving to Solana offers the project a wider audience and a more stable platform. Despite Solana’s own history of occasional outages, it is far more reliable and stable than Helium’s, according to Helium blog posts.  It will also give Helium a deeper pool of developers to call upon, as more developers are familiar with Solana blockchain’s coding language than Helium’s, according to Helium board member Arman Dezfuli-Arjomandi.  “You can no longer submit a transaction to the Helium blockchain,” Dezfuli-Arjomandi said in a livestream tracking the event around 12:10 p.m. ET (16:10 UTC) Tuesday. The livestream had around 200 viewers.  Under the transition Helium’s tokens will migrate to Solana and its hotspots – the hardware backbone behind Helium’s internet-of-things (IOT) network – switch from issuing HNT to IOT.

When asked by former U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne at Fintech Week in London whether COIN would consider moving to Britain, Armstrong reportedly said: ""anything is on the table, including relocating or whatever is necessary."" The CEO's remarks come as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sent a warning to Coinbase ( COIN ) -- the largest U.S.-based crypto exchange with some 100M verified users -- that the regulator recommended enforcement action against the company for allegedly breaching securities laws. It's worth mentioning that the SEC, among other regulators, has been ramping its crackdown on illicit activities within the crypto industry. On Monday, for instance, it charged fellow crypto exchange Bittrex for allegedly running an unregistered national securities exchange, broker and clearing agency. “The US has the potential to be an important market in crypto, but right now, we are not seeing that regulatory clarity needed,” Armstrong continued, as quoted by Bloomberg . “I think if a number of years go by where we don’t see regulatory clarity emerge in the US, we may have to consider investing more in other regions of the world.” Towards the end of March, Coinbase ( COIN ) was said to be in discussions with regulators about securing the appropriate license to continue operating in Canada, as the country's umbrella markets watchdog seeks to stiffen rules for such platforms.

Related Reading: Not So Fast: Bitcoin Strength Fails To Breach This Key Bullish Level Notably, Bitcoin halving events do have a significant effect on BTC prices. Historical data shows that the BTC price witnessed a significant push after every halving event. Clement posted a chart detailing BTC price movement at previous halving cycles. The curves show that Bitcoin prices notably increased after the halving events. For example, the first BTC halving event occurred in 2012 and saw the BTC price increase by a massive 2,830%. The same observation followed the subsequent halving events in 2016 and 2020. During these halving cycles, BTC’s price increased significantly after each event leading to the next one. The Reserve Risk metric is among the primary indicators that signaled Bitcoin’s parabolic price moves in the previous halving cycles. Bitcoin often gains value when the Reserve Risk has climbed above zero (0). Notably, the Reserve Risk metric has crossed zero again, as it did in the other halving cycles. That movement may indicate that Bitcoin is gearing up for another massive price increase. Bitcoin Price Outlook Many crypto investors have Bitcoin on their watchlists, closely keeping tabs on the assets as the community awaits the upcoming halving event. Usually, cryptocurrencies are highly volatile and often deviate from past price behaviors. Also, the recent move of the Reserve Risk metric above zero strongly indicates the possibility of another massive BTC growth cycle in the nearest future.

Bitcoin’s price earlier today, April 18, aligned with the bearish market-wide trend as the global crypto market cap dropped by 0.08%. Yesterday, April 17, Bitcoin closed with a 2.88% price decline at $29,445.04. The bearish price movement pushed BTC to surrender its past week’s gain with a 0.76% 7-day price decline early today. But as of press time, BTC and other assets have reclaimed their values pushing the global market cap up by 0.89%. With the recent indicator flashing bullish signals, BTC could be gearing up for new highs in the coming months.

42394069,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvVkiF,1681831364,Bitcoin’s 'Store-of-Value' Narrative Is Real but Not a Price Mover,"Markets are noisy, chaotic things that we human beings instinctively try to imbue with order and reason. This generally involves searching for explanations as to why prices are trending up or down or what triggered a sharp move.  Often there is an obvious explanation – an earnings surprise or an unexpected corporate action. Sometimes the cause isn't so easy to see – flows of funds, an evolving user base, steady product development and so on.  Noelle Acheson is the former head of research at CoinDesk and Genesis Trading. This article is excerpted from her Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, which focuses on the overlap between the shifting crypto and macro landscapes. These opinions are hers, and nothing she writes should be taken as investment advice.  With bitcoin (BTC), it’s even harder to discern what is driving sentiment shifts at any given time because it doesn’t have earnings, there are no corporate actions, regulation isn’t the threat it is for some other crypto assets and the narratives are multiple and varied. There isn’t even universal agreement as to what bitcoin is, let alone what drives its price.  But our search for reason amid chaos encourages us to latch on to something that makes sense, and if it is a narrative that justifies our interest while highlighting a timely concept, then so much the better.  Store of value  One phrase we’re hearing a lot of these days is “store of value.” It tends to mean different things to different people, but in general, it refers to an asset that holds its value relative to a broad basket of other assets over a long stretch of time.  In spite of its short-term price volatility and sharp bear markets, bitcoin is a store of value because it is the only asset traded on liquid exchanges today with a programmatic and verifiable hard cap. With other “hard assets” (those with limited supply) such as gold, diamonds or real estate, we don’t know the supply cap, nor do we know how much is currently in existence.  Read more: Noelle Acheson - Bitcoin and the Changing Definition of 'Safety'  Plus, with other “hard assets,” the price influences the potential supply. For instance, if gold were to surge from $2,000 to $20,000 per ounce, new extraction methods would become viable, boosting the theoretical cap. Bitcoin is the only asset traded on liquid exchanges for which the price has no influence whatsoever on the supply. It is the hardest of hard assets.  What’s more, the supply of its most common denominator – the U.S. dollar – has been increasing over the decades, and more recently at an astonishing pace. We are likely about to embark on another wave of monetary easing, involving lower interest rates and the incentivization of credit to overcome declining economic growth and consumption.  An increase in the supply of USD above what economic growth can absorb will – all other things being equal – decrease its value relative to other assets, and following basic math, if the value of the denominator drops, that of the ratio increases. Bitcoin is a store of value and a hedge against currency debasement.  Finally, bitcoin the asset lives on a decentralized network (confusingly also called Bitcoin, distinguished here with uppercase), which lends this store of value an almost unique degree of seizure resistance. It can be argued that other hard assets can be held “off the grid” (gold can be kept under the kitchen floorboards, and maybe no one knows about the cabin in the woods), but they are complicated to transport and can be seized. Bitcoin ownership doesn't reside on centralized ledgers unless it is at the holder’s request, an option many choose for convenience. Even so, the asset’s inherent seizure resistance and mobility further enhance its store-of-value qualities.  Trader-led expectation of growing interest in the store of value narrative is probably behind more of the recent price move than is actual interest  Long-term holders  Given the ballooning economic uncertainty, it makes sense that investors are looking to strengthen their portfolios with stores of value, and it makes sense that many are starting to pay more attention to this novel asset. This growing interest, we’re told, is one of the main factors behind bitcoin’s more than 80% price increase since the beginning of the year.  Only, technically, it’s not.  Stores of value are generally of interest to longer-term investors. Bitcoin’s price is set by short-term traders.  That’s not to say that the store-of-value narrative hasn't been a key driver of bitcoin investment since the early days. In bull markets and bear, those with a long-term thesis have been steady accumulators – metrics that track the movement of bitcoin on-chain show that almost 30% of bitcoin in circulation hasn't moved in over five years, and even during the painful drawdown of last year, that percentage continued going up and to the right (true, some of these bitcoin could be permanently lost, but the bulk of it most likely corresponds to store-of-value investors). Almost 40% hasn't moved in over three years, over 50% hasn't moved in over two. You get the picture.  But this steady accumulation has been quiet and consistent, and hasn't accounted for bitcoin’s wild price swings. Those are driven by speculation on this and other narratives.  Short-term traders  In any public market, the latest trade is what determines the price. In liquid markets, there are trades every nanosecond, and they are usually at prices close to the last one but changing preferences will move this up or down. These are usually from traders and market makers hoping to profit from short-term moves, which are influenced by narratives and news.  For bitcoin, while we don’t have access to the churn in exchange volumes since these happen off-chain, we do know the average age of on-chain movements. Much more trading is done off-chain than on-chain, and so we can assume that they are at least representative of the makeup of exchange volumes. The chart below from Glassnode shows that, on any given day, at least half of bitcoin transferred between addresses had last been moved within the previous 24 hours (the light and dark yellow bands). Even on-chain, the bitcoin market is high turnover, and short-term traders dominate.  So, in the case of bitcoin, the trader-led expectation of growing interest in the store-of-value narrative is probably behind more of the recent price move than is actual interest. Investors may increasingly see bitcoin as a store of value, and growing demand in the face of a fixed supply will obviously push the price up. But the bulk of price moves are from traders betting on this demand rather than actually forming part of it.  This highlights the key role narratives play in crypto markets, more so than in other markets with a steadier flow of fundamental data.  It also exaggerates price movements on the way up, and on the way down. Unlike fundamental value drivers, narratives are inflated and deflated by sentiment, which is influenced by an incomprehensible range of factors. It even ends up influencing itself.  Price as the story  What generally happens in bitcoin cycles is that the prevailing narrative starts out being about one thing (e.g., store of value) and ends up being about another (price). Whatever you may believe is the main story line driving current interest – store of value happens to be the one I’m hearing most about these days, but there’s also monetary liquidity, the need for banking “insurance” and more – our attention invariably pivots to price movements, which themselves end up becoming the story.  We need to keep an eye out for this because we’ve all seen how that type of narrative can push the price up (which is good) but rapidly remove support when winds change. When “price” becomes the story, we need to be aware that sentiment is becoming flimsier, because traders are no longer betting on what longer-term investors will do, they are betting on what other traders will do.  The underlying potential growth may not have changed and accumulation by those with an eye on the bigger picture will continue regardless. But sentiment and price tend to be driven by short-term market participants who are influenced by much more than a good story. This matters for market momentum, and serves as a warning against becoming too wedded to any particular narrative when it comes to trying to make sense of market moves.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Noelle Acheson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/04/18/bitcoins-store-of-value-narrative-is-real-but-not-a-price-mover,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d436aa85654955dc0354f8e5d8625042441112e3-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Montreal-based Nuvei partnered with FTX in December 2021 to enable ways for users to receive instant payments to buy crypto more quickly and securely.  The company may also have been an investor in the now-bankrupt crypto exchange, claimed Spruce Point, which said it spoke to a former Nuvei executive about the matter. Spruce Point further noted that Nuvei was recently listed as a creditor in FTX’s bankruptcy case.  “If true, Nuvei failed to transparently disclose its full interest while announcing an FTX partnership that facilitated the movement of funds into FTX,” the report stated.  Nuvei shares fell 6% in the immediate aftermath of the report’s release, but had rebounded into positive territory at press time.  Spruce Point also pointed out that Nuvei hired FTX’s former global head of payments, Adam Cole, as a senior vice president. Cole “advised multiple defunct companies with ties to known stock promoters with a list of unsavory allegations,” claimed the report.  A representative for Nuvei didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.  Nuvei booked $19.2 million in crypto-related revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022, down 58% from the fourth quarter a year earlier.  A Nuvei spokesperson responded to CoinDesk: ""Short reports have become increasingly commonplace in the public equity markets We will not comment or respond further to any point of view issued by the authors of the report.

Inflation in this context refers to growth in the supply of a token; lower inflation could lead to higher token prices, based on the rules of supply and demand.

42394060,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvVjsx,1681830399,How OFAC’s Tornado Cash Sanctions Violate U.S. Citizens’ Constitutional Rights,"The Office of Foreign Assets Control’s (OFAC) decision last year to impose sanctions on the Tornado Cash software protocol has far-reaching implications for the rights of Americans and raises serious regulatory and constitutional questions. Six individuals who fell victim to OFAC’s actions are fighting for their rights in Van Loon v. U.S. Department of the Treasury.  Last week, to assist the court in fully understanding the broad implications of these sanctions, Blockchain Association and DeFi Education Fund filed a friend of the court brief arguing why privacy is a fundamental right that should be protected, even in the digital realm.  Marisa T. Coppel is policy counsel at the Blockchain Association.  Tornado Cash is a self-executing computer software published on the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to maintain their financial privacy while using blockchain technology. Unlike a bank's ledger, blockchains are public, permanent and maintained through a decentralized network of computers.  While transactions on blockchains are publicly viewable, the user's identity is not identified as transactions are linked to ""public keys,"" which is similar to an email address. An individual’s desire to keep their transactions away from public view is more than reasonable given how much information our blockchain transaction history can share about our lives.  A heightened desire for on-chain privacy clearly exists considering the sensitive nature of how many people use crypto – such as donating to politically charged causes, paying for private medical procedures or purchasing certain religious or personal items. The Tornado Cash tool allows users to protect their privacy, all while retaining the benefits of transacting on a blockchain.  OFAC's decision to sanction Tornado Cash is unprecedented, marking the first time that software has been targeted for sanctions. OFAC’s sanctioning authority extends only to persons or property. Yet, Tornado Cash is neither a person nor property: It is owned by nobody, controlled by nobody and functions automatically without human intervention.  Thus, OFAC’s overreach in sanctioning software goes beyond its legal purview.  OFAC's actions also represent an expansion of their authority that can only be authorized by Congress. Without congressional authorization, OFAC's sanctions are unlawful and must be challenged.  Moreover, OFAC’s sanctions (which as mentioned go beyond the scope of the statute providing the agency with authority to sanction people and entities) also raises serious concerns under the First and Fifth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution. OFAC’s actions contravene a fundamental, uniquely American right not enjoyed by the majority of people in the world – the right to engage in socially valuable speech, such as speech that is related to political or ideological viewpoints.  Regarding the Fifth Amendment, OFAC’s actions deprive plaintiffs of their property without the due process of law required by the U.S. Constitution and history of case law. Because of these constitutional concerns, the court must interpret any ambiguity in OFAC’s sanctioning authority in a manner that avoids harming plaintiffs’ constitutional rights.  Read more: The Downside of Sanctioning Tornado Cash / Opinion  If OFAC's sanctions on Tornado Cash are allowed to stand, it sets a dangerous precedent that could pave the way for the sanctioning of any open-source encryption protocol, including code that enables secure credit card transactions online. This would have severe implications for law-abiding Americans’ financial privacy and undermine their ability to freely use technological innovations in the future.  In short, OFAC's overreach threatens to stifle innovation and hinder the growth of the U.S. blockchain industry, which has the potential to revolutionize how we interact in the digital world.  It is crucial to recognize that Tornado Cash is simply a tool – and punishing the tool itself rather than the bad actors who may misuse it runs contrary to the values this country was founded upon. The responsible and lawful use of blockchain technology should be protected, and regulatory actions should be targeted at those who abuse the technology for illegal purposes.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Marisa T.

42413944,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAo5OZ,1681830211,Bitcoin Financial Services Firm Unchained Capital Raises $60M,"Unchained Capital has completed a $60 million Series B funding round led by Valor Equity Partners and including crypto asset-management giant NYDIG, the company said in a press release Tuesday.  The round opened to investors halfway through the first quarter of this year and had an initial close in April that included more than half of the total raised, a source close to the company told CoinDesk. The new capital will go towards growing the client base, improving the existing product suite and expanding product offerings.  It's a notably large fundraise given the extent of the crypto bear market that in the first third of 2023 is only beginning to show signs of turning around. Unchained itself wasn’t immune to the pressures of crypto winter, having cut its workforce by 15% in mid-November 2022.  Austin, Texas-based Unchained offers a collaborative custody solution that shares control of a user’s bitcoin between a private key the user holds and private keys held by Unchained and other financial services providers. The model utilizes bitcoin’s native multisignature capabilities to offer the benefits of self-custody without the risks that come with a single point of failure, such as a lost or stolen key. Unchained doesn’t have the ability to move or utilize client funds on its own, which were the types of actions that helped lead to crypto exchange FTX’s collapse. Unchained currently secures over $2 billion in bitcoin across thousands of keys, according to the company  Unchained also offers bitcoin-collateralized loans and has originated over $500 million of such loans since 2017 The firm’s other services include a trading desk, where clients can directly buy bitcoin and an IRA offering.  “In the midst of market chaos, Unchained has emerged as a highly trusted provider of bitcoin custody and financial services through superior technology, risk management, regulatory compliance, and client service,” said Valor partner Vivek Pattipati, who will be joining the Unchained board of directors. “Particularly in lending, the company has differentiated itself by minimizing risk to both the lender and the borrower, leading to resilience and an extraordinary opportunity to capture market share.""  Other investors in the round included Trammell Venture Partners, Ecliptic Capital and Highland Capital Partners. NYDIG previously co-led the $25 million Series A for Unchained Capital in June 2021.

11892306,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=527358,1681830009,"Arbitrum Defies Bears As ARB Price Breaks Above $1.7 Resistance, But Can It Keep Up?","Arbitrum (ARB) had a rough couple of weeks following its community airdrop that saw around 1 billion tokens airdropped to active participants on the layer 2 blockchain. However, there is already a turn in the tide as the crypto market has recovered and ARB has emerged as one of the strongest performers in the space. Arbitrum Becomes A Force To Be Reckoned With Unlike a good number of Layer 2 blockchains which have seen their volumes decline after being in the spotlight for a while, Arbitrum has not let up. In fact, the blockchain has begun to rival Ethereum, the Layer 1 blockchain it is built on top of, in terms of volume. Related Reading: FTX Token (FTT) Price Doubles In 24 Hours, Here’s Why On Monday, data from DeFiLlama revealed that Arbitrum actually saw more volume than Ethereum in a 24-hour period. Now, this didn’t last for long as Ethereum would retake its position once more. But it helped to solidify Arbitrum’s place as a force to be reckoned with in the space. Likewise, Arbitrum has also seen the number of accounts on the network reach a new milestone. As of Monday, the total number of ARB wallet addresses on the L2 crossed 5 million. Interestingly, the large majority of these addresses are classified as active addresses. Active users cross 5 million | Source: Dune Analytics This Dune Analytics dashboard shows that there are 4.237 million active addresses on the network which have carried out almost 200 million transactions. Furthermore, the number of contracts that have been created on the L2 has crossed 2 million. These metrics make Arbitrum the most active of all of the L2s. It also sees more volume than the BSC Chain, which is the second-largest L1 in the space. ARB Makes Its Way Above $1.7 Resistance In accordance with its rising usage and volume, the ARB price has enjoyed success in the market recently. After trending between $1.1 and $1.3 for the better part of the prior week, the digital asset saw a surge in momentum which pushed it above the $1.7 resistance level. ARB’s trading volume for the last 24 hours grew by 27% to $1.3 billion. This growth indicates increased interest in the digital asset, which would explain why it is surging in the last few days. Its price also briefly hit $1.8 before correcting back downwards as bears tried to fight back. Related Reading: Bears Drag Ethereum Below $2,100 Support As ETH Withdrawals Cross $2 Billion Nevertheless, the Arbitrum native token remains on a bullish trend and is still what many considered undervalued. The reason for this is the market cap of MATIC, another L2 token, is sitting at over $10 billion even though Arbtirum is seeing more volume compared to Polygon. Given this, the interest in the L2 could push it further, and at the same market cap as MATIC, ARB would be looking at a fair market price of $9 per token. ARB is currently leading the gainers on Coinmarketcap after rising 8.72% in 24 hours. It is trading at a price of $1.77 and its market cap has grown above $2.2 billion.

42413942,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAo5JG,1681827600,Lukso Genesis Validator Smart Contract to Go Live on 4/20 at '4:20',"Lukso, a layer 1 blockchain for creative types that was co-founded by blockchain veterans Fabian Vogelsteller and Marjorie Hernandez, is opening a smart contract that lets “Genesis,” or original validators, participate in running the blockchain.  The smart-contract deposits will open on the Ethereum blockchain on April 20 (4/20) at 16:20 UTC (or as the team put it, 4:20 p.m. UTC), and will be running for three weeks. According to the team, the choice of time is a reference to ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" book series, television program and movie. Perhaps not entirely coincidentally, it's also a staple of cannabis-culture slang that ranks highly among crypto memes.  Anyone can become a Genesis validator if they contribute 32 LYXE (about $439 worth) to secure the network. (LYXE is Lukso’s native token, based on the Ethereum blockchain, which will convert to LYX once the Lukso blockchain is live.)  The Genesis validators will generate the Genesis files, which will run the new blockchain.  “So the community basically just runs the network with these Genesis files and starts the Lukso network,” Vogelsteller told CoinDesk.  Read more: Inventor of Ethereum’s ERC-20 Token Standard Plans New Blockchain ‘LUKSO’ for Creative Types  Genesis validators on Lukso will have an important role in establishing the supply of the LYX token, as well as how involved the Foundation (the Foundation for New Creative Economies) will be in the ecosystem. As part of the smart contract deposit, Genesis validators will vote on how many LYX tokens should exist when the network starts. They will vote on whether 35 million LYX will be in circulation with the Foundation holding 11.8% of the token supply, 42 million LYX in circulation with the Foundation holding 26.5% of token supply, or 100 million LYX in circulation, with the Foundation holding 69.1% of token supply.  Lukso’s Genesis deposit smart contract will run as long as it obtains 4,096 validator keys to start safely. Once enough validator keys are created, Lukso will freeze the smart contract, and the Lukso blockchain network will start running.  Lukso is a new layer 1 project aimed at blockchain creatives, and what the project's co-founders call the “creative economy.” The blockchain is centered around “universal profiles,” which gives users the ability to create an on-chain identity to be used in all sorts of places (NFTs, decentralized social media, payments), making activity of users integrated under one roof that is more than just a wallet address.  “When we started exploring the idea you had a community that was very developer centric,” said Marjorie Hernandez, a co-founder of Lukso. Hernandez said that she is excited to see what others use the blockchain for. “I really look forward to people building implementations of the universal profiles that are superior to ours, and marketplaces and more.”  The LXYE price had gained 9.7% over the prior 24 hours at the time CoinDesk broke the news of the timing of the launch, but it has since climbed another 8.8% – one of the day’s best-performing tokens among those with market capitalization of at least $100 million, according to Messari.  The token’s price has roughly doubled since CoinDesk wrote of the plans for the launch on April 5.  CORRECTION (April 20, 2023 16:04 UTC): After publication of this story, Lukso contacted us to correct numbers on token supply and how long the window will be open for those looking to join the smart contract.

11890859,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=527299,1681826453,Bitcoin Bearish Signal: Exchange Whale Ratio Spikes,"On-chain data shows the Bitcoin exchange whale ratio has observed a sharp spike recently, a sign that could be bearish for the asset’s price. Bitcoin Exchange Whale Ratio Has Been Elevated Recently As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, whales may be making deposits to sell currently. The “exchange whale ratio” is an indicator that measures the ratio between the sum of the top 10 inflows to exchanges and the total exchange inflows. The 10 largest transactions to exchanges can be assumed to be coming from the whales, so this ratio’s value tells us what percentage of the total transfers towards these platforms is being contributed by the whales. When the value of this indicator is high, it means a large percentage of the exchange inflows is coming from these humongous holders currently. Such a trend can have bearish implications for the price as it can be a sign of mass selling from the whales. On the other hand, low values of the metric suggest these investors are making up for a healthier portion of the exchange inflows. This kind of trend can either be bullish or neutral for the price, depending on some other factors. Related Reading: Bitcoin 30-Day Transaction Count Near Cycle Highs, Bullish Sign? Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin exchange whale ratio over the last couple of years: Looks like the value of the metric has been quite high recently | Source: CryptoQuant The version of the Bitcoin exchange whale ratio used here is specifically for the spot platforms, as spot exchanges are what investors generally use for selling-related activities. As shown in the above graph, the indicator’s value has sharply risen in the last few days and is now around a value of 0.64. This means that 64% of the total exchange inflows are coming from the whales alone currently. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Truly Done With Cycle Lows? Here’s What This Metric Says In the chart, the quant has also highlighted the points where the metric has previously shown such spikes, as well as how the price of the cryptocurrency has reacted to occurrences like these. It seems like a lot of these instances proved to be bearish for the price of the cryptocurrency as the asset hit a peak when they took place. This means that the selling pressure from the whales was behind the decline during these occurrences. There were other instances, however, that didn’t end up having any noticeable effects on the price. Some of these took place following big moves in the asset’s value, so they may have been caused by exchanges getting in more liquidity into their platforms (since purchases from exchanges will also show up as extremely large inflows in on-chain data). This implies that the latest high exchange whale ratio doesn’t necessarily have to be bearish for Bitcoin. However, considering that these spikes in whale inflows have come while the price has been surging, it’s possible that these deposits have been made for taking profits at the current high prices. If this is indeed the case, then BTC could face a drawdown in the near term. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $29,900, up 1% in the last week.

42413963,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAo5uP,1681826400,"Developers Stay Resilient Through Harsh Crypto Winter, Report Says","Data from Web3 developer back end company Alchemy shows that despite the latest chapter of crypto winter that has unfolded over the past few months, developers remain resilient in their efforts to deploy decentralized applications (dapps).  According to the firm’s first-quarter 2023 ""Developer Report,"" developers installed an average of 1.9 million Ethereum software development kits (SDK) per week, a 47% increase year over year. Additionally, 788% more wallet SDKs were deployed since the first quarter of 2022, an all-time high for installing wallet infrastructure.  Although non-fungible token (NFT) trading volume has decreased 82% year over year, it has increased 126% since the last quarter of 2022. As for decentralized finance (DeFi), trading volume on decentralized exchanges (DEX) is down 38% since Q1 2022, but it is on the rise in the new year, and has seen a 43% increase since December 2022.  It’s not just Ethereum where there were new highs in developer activity. Developers across sidechain Polygon and layer 2 networks Arbitrum and Optimism deployed 160% more smart contracts year over year, fueled in part by a desire to build on Ethereum scaling protocol zkSync 2.0, which went live in February, and Polygon’s zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM), which was released to the public at the end of March.  Jason Shah, head of growth at Alchemy, told CoinDesk that although crypto winter has been long and trying for many Web3 developers, there’s still an incentive to stick around for when the market finally returns to its previous levels.  “It’s certainly not easy to survive a crypto bear market, and the longer it goes the more challenging it can be,” said Shah. “But what we're noticing is most of the builders who are in the space are here for the technology, and so many people certainly look forward to a return in more top-line metrics like prices, and a lot of new projects being launched and new funding entering the space.”  While the last quarter may bring promise to the crypto space, it certainly has been challenging for many companies to not only hold their funds but confidently operate as expected. The recent collapses of Signature Bank, Silvergate Bank and Silicon Valley Bank, along with concerns over the U.S. regulatory crackdown on cryptocurrency, haven’t been promising for the future of Web3.  Shah noted that while events have shaken public sentiment around the space, developers have remained nothing but “resilient” towards building blockchain-based products and services.  “It hasn't been the most ‘gangbusters’ quarter ever in terms of crypto growth, but we're seeing this strong resilience under the surface of the broader narrative,” said Shah. “During the more euphoric periods in the market, there's kind of frenetic urgency and unbridled optimism,” said Shah.

The vote, which will take place directly in the dapp's mobile app, will decide how the protocol spends 100 million of its native sweatcoin (SWEAT) tokens. Each community member will have one vote rather than wielding voting power proportional to the size of his or her governance token holdings, as is traditionally the case within decentralized autonomous organizations. Voting will also be restricted to liquid token holders, effectively excluding Sweat Economy's team members, investors and founders from weighing in on the proposal.  The network's founders say the measures will combat inequalities baked into traditional decentralized voting processes, which favor wealthy token holders and project founders over ordinary community members.  ""We believe that everyone should have a say in the direction of our company, regardless of the amount of tokens they hold, their knowledge of Web3 governance or wallet connection,"" co-founder Oleg Fomenko said in a press release.  The vote is likely to be ""one of the largest governance votes in the history of Web3,” with 15 million token holders eligible to participate, Fomenko said.  Participants will determine how many of the 100 million tokens are allocated to staking rewards and how many are removed from the token's circulating supply, which could affect the token's price.

Gensler's repeated statements to the industry to ""come in and register"" are a ""willful misrepresentation"" of his agency's framework, according to the letter.  ""Given an NSE can only list securities that have been offered in compliance with the securities laws, the inability to register makes the current NSE framework ill-suited for digital asset trading platforms.

Gensler has repeatedly said he believes his agency has the authority it needs to oversee crypto, and argued that all crypto exchanges should register with the regulator. More recently, enforcement actions against companies Beaxy and Bittrex suggest he believes that exchanges should register as a national securities exchange, broker and clearinghouse.  In prepared remarks published Monday, Gensler reiterated his view that ""most crypto tokens are securities,"" adding that this is why he believes intermediaries – like exchanges – need to register with the regulator.  ""Crypto investors should benefit from compliance with the same laws that [Rep.

42394065,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvVkNj,1681825146,A Technologist’s Approach to Explaining What Crypto Fixes,"Breakthrough technologies are built on the promise of value – the ability to create something new that makes some element of human coordination undeniably better.  From the moment Satoshi released the Bitcoin white paper, crypto evangelists have touted the immense, revolutionary potential value of the technology. Web3 was positioned as a panacea for the world’s systemic issues, with applications for everything from supply chains to identity to finance. Anything could be fixed once put on-chain.  Ankush Agarwal is the co-founder and chief architect at Co:Create.  I was leading an open-source project called Kubeflow at Google when blockchain first came on my radar. As a developer, it was clear open protocols would be superior to the closed systems that dominated the web. But the use cases that drove the early hype cycles of Web3 were experimental and often risky. Google’s motto was, infamously, “Don’t be evil.” What then was the slogan of the early days of Web3? “Not for the faint of heart?”  In 2018 I joined what was then Facebook to design and build critical components of the Libra stablecoin project, a project that was as initially controversial as it was ambitious. Criticism aside, there’s no denying that Facebook was a breakthrough technology. It unlocked immense value in the form of communication and connectivity that transformed human coordination globally. The “Blue App” was intuitive, convenient and accessible.  Facebook got close to bringing that same user experience to Web3 with the launch of Libra (albeit in a way that would’ve abandoned the fundamental openness of Web3 and distorted the promise of the technology). Libra would have put access to a stablecoin and an entire ecosystem of financial products into the hands of billions, accelerating blockchain’s daily active users by orders of magnitude overnight.  But that didn’t happen, and the world is better for it.  I learned many lessons as an engineer working within Web2 giants. I’ve experienced the limitations of closed-source technology and the inequity it creates. It’s what makes building in Web3 so exciting. The benefits of decentralization, catnip for technologists who thrive on the conceptual, is difficult to describe to many people we want as users. It’s hard to tell people how Web3 can solve problems they don’t understand, especially when existing solutions seem to work just fine.  The complexity of building applications on decentralized technology has created a growing delta, to slip in a little techno-speak, between devs and users.  In order to create meaningful impact with Web3, we need to focus on immediate user value rather than getting bogged down in technical processes. Rather than striving for technical perfection we should prioritize creating user-friendly and accessible applications that solve real-world problems and drive mainstream adoption of Web3. Ultimately, value is defined by how people use the product, not how sophisticated the tech is under the hood.  Web3, what is it good for?  We’re nearly 15 years into the decentralized revolution, and we now have a robust technological foundation that supports a myriad of exciting use cases. New industries have emerged, built on Web3 models that undeniably create value and have achieved mainstream awareness. But awareness does not equate to mainstream adoption.  See also: Usability in Web3 - How to Unlock Mass Adoption | Webinar  Web3 is a transformational technology, but in order for it to achieve its breakthrough moment we need to shift our perception of value from its ideological future state to one centered on immediate user value. We need to adopt a more user-centric approach and make the value of Web3 more relevant to more people, offering compelling solutions to inefficiencies that people can recognize.  If there’s anything technologists like more than a well-defined if poorly understood phrase, it’s a well-ordered list. These are my engineering principles for balancing technology with customer value:  Put the customer first: Our ultimate goal is to deliver value to our customers. Every decision we make, every feature we build and every process we follow should be driven by an understanding of our customers' needs.  Optimize for customer value, not just technical sophistication: The most technologically advanced system is not always the best option for our customers. We must weigh technical capabilities against the time to deliver value and choose the one that will provide the most value to our customers in the shortest amount of time.  Focus on impact, not just process: Our customers care about the results we deliver, not the steps we take to get there. We prioritize delivering meaningful results over following strict processes.  Be agile and move fast without breaking things: We are in a position where we have to quickly iterate through multiple product ideas and ship them to our customers. We must be extremely agile and ready to change direction based on market/customer feedback. We cannot afford to move slowly or break things.  Done is better than perfect: While it's important to strive for excellence, it's equally important to acknowledge that there may be limitations to what can be achieved in a given timeframe.  Collective ownership and individual accountability: This refers to the idea that all members of the team are responsible for the codebase and has the authority to make changes to it. However, each team member is also individually accountable for the quality and maintainability of their own contributions.  It’s a tall order, but that’s how we break through to the masses.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Ankush Agarwal,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/04/18/a-technologists-approach-to-explaining-what-crypto-fixes,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3d516b855b2a159e63de66c5d4f496cc802b3aea-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Blockdaemon Wallet will incorporate some of the firm’s existing wallet infrastructure – along with a handful of new features – into a new platform focused on security, compliance and liquidity, according to the company.  Nearly every crypto investor has at some point heard the adage, “not your keys, not your crypto” – the point being that holding assets in one’s own crypto wallet, rather than entrusting them to an intermediary, is the only true way to guarantee that those funds stay safe.  Large financial institutions, however, are forced to contend with regulations and security constraints that make consumer-focused crypto wallets (e.g., browser wallets like MetaMask or hardware wallets like Ledger) inadequate. For this reason, they frequently secure their assets with third-party “custodians.”  But some custodians struggle to offer customers instant access to their funds, and trusting a middleman with your crypto is difficult to square with the “not your keys, not your crypto” ethos.  Self-custody  The past year is replete with examples of companies like the FTX exchange and crypto lender Celsius Network that squandered their clients’ funds – or collapsed into bankruptcy, only for clients’ crypto holdings to be trapped.  “Self-custody has become more important not just for individuals, but also for our customer base, which is institutions,” Blockdaemon CEO Konstantin Richter told CoinDesk. “We saw a sort of blatant gap in the market, which is that larger institutions really want to control keys and assets, and they also want to make sure that they have access to liquidity, are compliant, and have the highest degree of security.”  Blockdaemon, which raised $207 million in Series C funding last year and counts the Wall Street firm Goldman Sachs and the investment firm Tiger Global among its investors, offers a suite of blockchain infrastructure products geared towards crypto custodians, stakers and node operators.  Richter says the Blockdaemon Wallet plans to eventually integrate other elements of Blockdaemon’s toolkit, like its staking suite which helps institutions “stake” crypto on blockchains such as Ethereum in return for a reward.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/04/18/blockdaemon-sets-sights-on-large-institutions-with-new-wallet-app,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5e28c8e24c4b594dc19a67b1cdd9015a12a39ced-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42413967,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAo6AK,1681824275,This AI Chatbot Plugs Into Your Crypto Wallet,"The artificial intelligence overlords are coming for your coins.  Decentralized Finance lender marginFi on Tuesday debuted an experimental chatbot called Omni. It’s a custom build of OpenAI’s wildly popular ChatGPT with a twist: It can also interact with your wallet.  “The idea is to make crypto easier,” marginFi CEO Edgar Pavlovsky told CoinDesk in an interview. He says Omni can help users perform simple Web3 tasks, like spinning up a transaction to deposit and withdraw tokens to and from decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols such as his.  MarginFi’s chatbot is an early example of two buzzy corners of the tech sector merging. Though it's not the first instance of crypto boosters building on ChatGPT, Omni’s ability to plug right into one’s wallet and become what is essentially a text-based user interface is unique.  To start, Omni's crypto functionality can interact only with marginFi. It’s not yet able to generate transactions between wallets. Pavlovsky said he’s in talks with other Solana teams, including Drift and Backpack, about utilizing Omni on their respective protocols. He wants the tool to become a virtual assistant for navigating Web3.  Omni is trained on reams of Solana-specific information, like protocol documentation and blog posts, in order to better address questions pertaining only to crypto. It pulls token price data from oracle service Pyth.  It generally refuses to answer queries outside the bounds of cryptocurrency and sometimes employs a Scottish twang to ward freewheeling questioners away.  The tech, which Pavlovsky emphasized is experimental, is far from perfect. A reporter who tested Omni on Monday found it has a strong tendency to “hallucinate,” the industry term for chatbots’ tendency to confidently present fake (sometimes absurd) assertions as fact. Omni’s hallucinations often mush crypto lingo into the mix.  Omni’s wallet access also sometimes falters. It can get confused by complicated prompts and doesn’t always interpret commands in the way askers intend. Still, all transactions need user approval before execution, meaning Omni won’t just drain your wallet.  “Ideally Omni is max hands-on” in helping users utilize their crypto wallets, Pavlovsky said. “The question is how safe is it?” He’s working to strike the right balance.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | SOL | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/04/18/new-ai-chatbot-plugs-into-your-crypto-wallet,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7c3134e6ff41bd962e32ac7f78cbe206723eefa3-4603x2589.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

11889413,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=527313,1681822802,"Bitcoin Supply Structure Very Similar To Early 2019, Bull Run Ahead?","Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency in the market, reached a new yearly high last week. However, since then, it has been trading within a new range between $29,500 and $30,000, failing to consolidate above this key level and continue its rally towards higher territories. According to new data analyzed by Satoshi Club, a leading cryptocurrency platform, Bitcoin has built a strong foundation below $30,000, with the current supply structure resembling that of early 2016 and 2019. This news comes as a promising sign for bulls, suggesting that Bitcoin’s future may be brighter than previously thought. Is Bitcoin Poised For New Highs? According to Satoshi Club, the supply distribution of Bitcoin has been split into two: pre-FTX collapse for long-term holders (LTH) supply and post-collapse for short-term holders (STH) supply. This has resulted in LTH supply near all-time highs for several months or even a year. Furthermore, according to Satoshi Club, BTC’s Long-Term Holder supply has reached a new all-time high of 14.161 million BTC. Meanwhile, the Short-Term Holder supply remains steady at 2.914 million BTC. Related Reading: Binance Coin (BNB) Rallies 8% Ahead Of Hard Fork Upgrade The most recent bull runs in 2016 and 2019 took 18-24 months to start, and during those times, Bitcoin saw a quick spike in long-term holdings in profit, followed by profit-taking. Currently, Bitcoin is experiencing strength in its price, with year-to-date (YTD) gains backed by an “explosive uptick” in coins held at a profit. This means that more and more investors are holding onto their BTC, as they are currently in profit. This is a positive sign for the market as it indicates that investors have faith in the long-term potential of Bitcoin. Additionally, Satoshi Club highlights that in the current market environment, the foundation of Bitcoin appears to be much stronger than in previous bear markets. In 2023, 6.2 million Bitcoin returned to profit, which represents 32.3% of the total supply. This indicates a strong cost basis foundation below $30,000, which is a positive sign for the long-term prospects of BTC. Moreover, according to Satoshi Club, Bitcoin is unlikely to visit prices below $15,500 in the short term. This prediction is based on the current supply structure of Bitcoin, which indicates that there is significant support for the cryptocurrency at this price point. BTC Bulls Rejoice CryptoQuant, a leading crypto market data analytics platform, has released an analysis on the use of the “net volume” movement in predicting Bitcoin price fluctuations in the futures market. The analysis suggests that using a 72-day moving average to analyze the difference between long and short position volumes can help to some extent in predicting BTC price fluctuations. According to CryptoQuant’s analysis, the current Bitcoin position in the futures market is similar to what was observed in November and December 2020. From a sentiment perspective, the potential for Bitcoin’s price to rise is greater as increasing short positions are being liquidated.

42413973,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAo6lT,1681821000,Cubist Launches Bank-Grade Ethereum Key Management Service,"Cubist, a platform that uses bank-grade hardware to manage the keys that control digital assets, has launched a service aimed at institutional blockchain staking providers, timed to coincide with the arrival of staking deposits and withdrawals on Ethereum.  The firm's founding team of professors in cryptography from Carnegie Mellon University and the University of California San Diego have sought to replace the current array of cobbled-together and counterintuitive solutions that risk raw keys being exposed while signing transactions.  Up until Ethereum’s recent Shapella network upgrade, validators did not have the option to remove the tokens they had locked up in the preliminary stage of the public blockchain’s staking system.  While the inability to destake was something of a downside, it did have an upside, at least from a security perspective, said Cubist CEO Riad Wahby. Nobody could touch that money, not even its owner.  “The ability to destake can be nerve-wracking because these machines have to be online all the time, so it’s not like having 30 ETH in a cold wallet,” said Wahby in an interview with CoinDesk. “The machine has a key and is using that key all the time. Most of the solutions out there opt for convenience and store the key on the machine, and just hope that machine doesn’t get hacked.”  Cubist’s approach is to store staking keys in hardware security modules (HSM), physical computing devices that carry out digital signatures and can provide evidence if tampered with.  “HSMs are the gold standard in the banking industry, and for a good reason,” said Wahby. “Conceptually an HSM means your key is bound to a physical object. That’s very different from a case where somebody puts malware on your computer and silently copies your keys, and then a few weeks later the hack happens.”  Cubist, which recently raised a $7 million seed round, also announced that Web3 staking provider Ankr is its first key management customer.  “We chose Cubist because their team includes preeminent experts in applied cryptography and systems security,"" said Ankr co-founder Stanley Wu in a statement. ""They are uniquely qualified to secure Ankr’s most critical workflows.""",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | FIAT,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/04/18/cubist-launches-bank-grade-ethereum-key-management-service,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/69f4985de0028d26572ff1777858ef9738e26fa4-1500x844.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin has regained $30,000 on Tuesday after it had fallen to a 24-hour low of $29,100. The cryptocurrency was up 2.5% in the past 24 hours, andether and other altcoins also rose. Ether climbed 1.3% to hold above $2,000. “There is potential for positive momentum in alts now, and the downside risk is limited, as most altcoins are still in limbo; you can think of it as a BTC take-profit and high-beta trade,” Matteo Bottacini, a trader at Crypto Finance AG, wrote in a morning note. Radix, a blockchain built to deploy the XRD token, has rallied 35% in the past 24 hours, and Arbitrum’s ARB gained 10%.  Coinbase (COIN) CEO Brian Armstrong indicated that the crypto exchange would consider moving away from the U.S. if the regulatory environment for the industry doesn’t become clearer. ""Anything is on the table, including relocating or whatever is necessary"" he said at a conference in London. ""I think the U.S. has the potential to be an important market for crypto, but right now, we are not seeing that regulatory clarity that we need,"" Armstrong said. ""I think in a number of years if we don't see that regulatory clarity emerge in the U.S., we may have to consider investing more elsewhere in the world.""  FTX’s collapse was the catalyst for a new bullish cycle in cryptocurrency markets, brokerage firm Bernstein said in a research report Monday. The crypto exchange’s demise cleaned up the final tranche of “toxic crypto leverage” and taught digital-asset investors the importance of decentralization and self-custody wallets, Bernstein said. Macro catalysts are aligning for bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap, the note added, with continued weakness in U.S. regional banks and further deposit outflows toward money-market funds and the big four U.S. banks all reflecting concerns around the “centralization of money.”  Chart of the Day  The chart shows daily returns of alternative cryptocurrencies, which are known as altcoins, in bitcoin terms going back to February 2021.  The shaded region represents alt season – a crypto slang for periods a period where ether and other altcoins like XRP, SOL, DOT, gaming tokens, decentralized-finance coins and meme coins outperform bitcoin.  Altcoins' daily returns have recently flipped positive, signaling an investor shift toward the wider crypto market.  ""Altcoins median return vs. bitcoin is above the altcoin season average. However, we’re still below the full-blown alt-season returns,"" Swissblock Technologies said in an email to subscribers.

11888086,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=527305,1681819214,20% Rally Possible For Avalanche If It Surpasses This Key Resistance Level,"Over the past few weeks, Avalanche has made an impressive recovery in its price. Last week alone, AVAX surged by 20%, and on the daily chart, it showed over 4% appreciation. Despite facing a significant decline last month when its price dropped to $14, AVAX managed to rally by almost 50%. The technical analysis of the asset has pointed to significant bullishness, with buying strength increasing considerably. As demand moved up, so did accumulation. Currently, Avalanche is sitting underneath a crucial resistance level. If it manages to surpass this level, the altcoin could attempt another rally. Related Reading: Binance Coin (BNB) Rallies 8% Ahead Of Hard Fork Upgrade However, with Bitcoin still hovering below the $30,000 price mark, most altcoins are also resting under crucial resistance levels. If BTC continues to face downward pressure in the coming days, it could potentially trigger a pullback in AVAX’s price, which could create shorting opportunities for investors. The market capitalization of AVAX also appreciated which indicated an increase in buyers at press time. Avalanche Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, AVAX was trading at $21.40 and had successfully surpassed a crucial resistance level of $21, demonstrating bullishness on its chart. The next major overhead resistance for the altcoin is at $21.60, which has been a multi-month ceiling and is a vital resistance point, given the significant volume of sell orders in that zone. This area is known as a supply zone, and if AVAX manages to break through it, the price could potentially surge past other resistances and reach $25. However, if the altcoin fails to overcome this resistance level, it may face a pullback. The support level for AVAX currently stands at $19.60. A drop below that could drag the price down to $16. Technical Analysis Following AVAX’s successful trading above the $21 price mark, buyers have gained confidence, driving the altcoin’s price momentum in the market. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) was nearing 80, indicating overbuying tendencies and suggesting that the altcoin was overvalued at the time of writing. Typically, an overvalued asset experiences a price pullback. If a pullback were to occur for AVAX, it could briefly fall to $20 before experiencing another appreciation in value. In line with increased demand, the altcoin has moved above the 20 Simple Moving Average line, indicating that buyers are driving the price momentum in the market. AVAX has been exhibiting bullish indicators that suggest a potential buy signal for the altcoin. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) formed green signal bars, which are typically associated with buy signals. This further indicates positive price momentum for AVAX. Related Reading: OKB Tallies 24% Increase But Active Addresses Fail To Keep Pace – Here’s Why Additionally, the Bollinger Bands, which indicate volatility and price fluctuation, have opened up widely.

11887002,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=527295,1681816228,"Bitcoin And Crypto Are Rising Today, Here’s Why","The Bitcoin price remains the all-determining trend setter for the crypto market. After the Bitcoin price fell to as low as $29,173 yesterday, dragging all altcoins down with it, the crypto market is back in the green across the board today. At press time, the Bitcoin price has once again climbed above the key resistance level of $29,800. This means that BTC has gained 2.7% since yesterday’s low and was trading back above $29,900. Altcoins such as Arbitrum (ARB), Chainlink (LINK) and Avalanche (AVAX) are recording sharp price gains, dwarfing the Bitcoin uptrend. Here’s Why Bitcoin And Crypto Are Up Today As NewsBTC reported, yesterday’s correction in the Bitcoin price can be seen as a technical consolidation. In particular, the medium-term macroeconomic outlook continues to argue that both Bitcoin and the entire crypto market will see a continuation of their rally. An impetus for today’s rally may have been provided by the macro data from China, among other things. As announced in the morning hours today, China’s economy grew by 4.5% in the first quarter of 2023, the fastest pace in a year. Related Reading: Not So Fast: Bitcoin Strength Fails To Breach This Key Bullish Level Moreover, the increase was steeper than expected, as the end of “Zero COVID” led to a surge in consumer spending and factory output. All data were positive across the board. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (YoY) came in at 4.5% in Q1 2023, up from 4.0% estimate. Retail sales rose to 10.6% in March (YoY), versus 7.4% estimate. The unemployment rate was 5.3% versus 5.5% (estimate). Overall, strong Macro data from #china 📢 🇨🇳 Industrial Production (YoY) (Mar) came in at 3.9% Vs. 4.0% Est. 🇨🇳 GDP (YoY) (Q1) came in at 4.5% Vs. 4.0% Est. 🇨🇳 Retail Sales (YoY) (Mar) came in at 10.6% Vs. 7.4% Est. 🇨🇳 Unemployment Rate came in at 5.3% Vs. 5.5% Est.#GDP https://t.co/4btei6LudT — BACH (@MortensenBach) April 18, 2023 The US dollar index (DXY) is also likely to have provided additional impetus. Bitcoin and the DXY are inversely correlated, which means that the cryptocurrency usually rises when the DXY falls. The DXY has come under heavy pressure in recent weeks, but has experienced a minor relief rally since Friday, pushing the index up from 100,807 to 102,207. Now today, the DXY is showing a renewed weakness, plunging to 101,603. What’s Next For Bitcoin And The DXY? With this in mind, Glassnode co-founders Jan Happel and Yann Allemann call Bitcoin’s current move a “shallow correction,” which is the hallmark of a strong bull market rally. The analysts argue that there was a possibility of a potential pullback to $25,000. Related Reading: Company Of Legendary Peter Brandt Goes Long Bitcoin, Here’s His Target Price However, this has not materialized as Bitcoin has risen to $30k in a matter of days. “This is a very clear signal of the strength of momentum and higher prices are expected,” write Happel and Allemann, who add: We have pointed out $35k as the next major target – before $47k. This is still the outlook just as we expect much higher prices into late Q2 and Q3. But we still need to ask the question of the possible consequence for bitcoin if/when DXY moves to 105-107. The two analysts expect the DXY to reach the 91-93 range before the end of the year. However, based on the Elliott wave theory, they do expect a bounce to the upside first: We expect DXY to reach 105.8 or perhaps 107.2 – before rolling strongly over. A convincing decline below 100 would seriously question this setup.

42413966,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAo6QF,1681815923,UAE Securities Regulator to Start Accepting License Applications From Crypto Firms,"The federal securities regulator in the United Arab Emirates will start accepting applications from companies looking to provide crypto services in the country, according to a Monday announcement.  All virtual-asset service providers in the country – except for companies that are already licensed in the UAE's financial-free zones – must apply for approval with the Securities and Commodities Authority. The licensing regime was approved by the SCA on Monday following a decision by the UAE Council of Ministers last year to regulate the crypto sector. The SCA took on the role of regulating the sector earlier this year.  Some of the seven emirates, including Dubai and Abu Dhabi, already have licensing frameworks for crypto firms in force, with the local industry embracing Dubai's recently unveiled regime.  Companies looking to operate in the Emirate of Dubai must obtain a license from its Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority in addition to SCA approval, according to the announcement.  Firms seeking authorization will have to demonstrate ""operational efficiency and flexibility,"" and meet certain operational standards.  Amendments have been made to the virtual-asset rule book from 2022, according to the announcement. Financial activities like brokerage and custody of virtual assets, as well as a new category of virtual-asset service provider, have been added to the legislation.  ""A person wishing to engage in virtual-asset activities shall have headquarters in the State to conduct his business, according to one of the legal forms approved by the local authorities concerned with commercial licenses,"" the regulation dictates.

42413994,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAoIkN,1681810014,Lesser-Known Bitcoin Indicator Signals Onset of Major Bull Run,"A lesser-known but historically reliable bitcoin price indicator has flipped positive, signaling the onset of a major bull market.  Bitcoin's (BTC) reserve-risk multiple has crossed above zero, turning positive for the first time since October 2021, according to blockchain analytics firm Glassnode.  The previous crossovers above zero paved the way for parabolic price rallies. ""In 2012, 2013, 2015, 2019 and 2020, it resulted in gains of 2,830%, 566%, 6,400%, 99% and 487%, respectively,"" on-chain analyst Ali Martinez tweeted Monday.  Glassnode defines reserve risk as a long-term cyclical indicator, comparing the incentive to sell at the going market price with long-term holders resisting the temptation to liquidate. A lower reading indicates strong conviction among ""HODLers"" – slang for long-term crypto investors – and vice versa.  The reserve-risk multiple is calculated by dividing the daily indicator value by its 365-day moving average.  The reserve-risk multiple's previous crossovers above and below zero accurately predicted major bullish and bearish trends.  If history is a guide, the latest positive crossover means the cryptocurrency's 80% year-to-date rally to 10-month highs above $30,000 may be only the first milestone in its upward journey.  The bullish implication is consistent with bitcoin's tendency to chalk up outsized rallies in the months leading up to the mining reward halving. This programmed code reduces the pace of the cryptocurrency's supply expansion by 50% every four years. Bitcoin's fourth reward halving is due in April next year.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/04/18/lesser-known-bitcoin-indicator-flips-positive-after-18-months,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/150bdbe1d8e822e58f144da3328b269b19d83640-5956x3350.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

""Anything is on the table, including relocating or whatever is necessary"" he said after former U.K. Chancellor George Osbourne asked whether he could see Coinbase leaving the U.S. at Fintech Week in London.  ""I think the U.S. has the potential to be an important market for crypto, but right now we are not seeing that regulatory clarity that we need,"" he said. ""I think in a number of years if we don't see that regulatory clarity emerge in the U.S. we may have to consider investing more elsewhere in the world.""  Armstrong's comments come weeks after rival exchange Bittrex said it planned to exit the U.S. by the end of April, citing ""the current U.S. regulatory and economic environment."" Bittrex received a Wells Notice – a statement that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) Enforcement Division found evidence of legal violations – in March, general counsel David Maria told the Wall Street Journal. The SEC filed a lawsuit against the exchange on Monday.  Armstrong compared the U.K. situation, where there is only one regulator – the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) – responsible for both commodities and securities, with the U.S., where there are separate bodies: the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the SEC.  ""You don't have this unfortunate thing happening where the CFTC and the SEC are having a turf battle,"" he said. ""We actually have contradictory statements from the heads of the CFTC and the SEC coming out almost every few weeks. How's a business going to operate in that environment? We just want a clear rulebook.""  Coinbase received a Wells Notice from the SEC in March. Armstrong said Coinbase had met with the SEC ""30 times"" without getting feedback regarding the nature of its business before receiving the notice.  He said there's a lack of distinction or nuance in how regulators view the different arms of the cryptocurrency industry. Exchanges like Coinbase should be regulated like financial services companies, whereas the decentralized areas of the industry should be handled very differently because there is no central authority to regulate.  ""Things like Bitcoin, Ethereum, DeFi and even self-custodial wallets should be regulated like a software business or something like that,"" he said.  Coinbase Beyond Crypto  Armstrong also spoke of decentralized identity as one of the most compelling use cases for blockchain technology beyond cryptocurrency.  “Decentralized identity is a way for people to kind of have their own, information ... because they actually own it,"" Armstrong said.  “Decentralized social media is on the horizon. I think that's pretty important in terms of freedom of speech.”  Earlier this year, Coinbase unveiled Base, an Ethereum layer 2 network upon which developers can build decentralized apps (dapps), sending a signal it wants to go beyond the trading of digital assets and into developing and expanding the broader uses of blockchain technology.  UPDATE (April 18, 9:51 UTC): Adds further comments, Wells Notice starting in fourth paragraph.  UPDATE (April 18, 12:08 UTC): Adds Bittrex lawsuit in fourth paragraph, further detail and additional Armstrong comments including section on decentralized identity/social media.

11884149,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=527266,1681808407,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) Breakout Fails, But A Huge Rally Is Still Possible","While another breakout attempt for Shiba Inu (SHIB) from the current consolidation pattern failed with yesterday’s daily close on the 1-day chart, the price is still in prime position to complete a breakout by the end of April. As NewsBTC first reported last week, the SHIB price has formed an ascending triangle on the 1-day chart ever since March 10. The ascending triangle is one of the consolidation patterns, which signals that the previous trend direction will resume when the pattern finds its confirmation. The Shiba Inu price is currently showing strong signs that the consolidation phase is about to end, while the upward trend that started in January may resume. Shiba Inu Price Primed For Another Breakout Attempt? A look at the 1-day chart shows that despite a strong start to the day, Shiba Inu failed to close above the $0.00001151 resistance line yesterday. Towards the end of the day, SHIB ran out of steam, in line with the Bitcoin price pullback. This caused the SHIB price to fall once again into the ascending triangle pattern. As NewsBTC discussed, high trading volume is required for a clean breakout. If the breakout takes place on low volume, as it did yesterday, it is usually a false signal. Related Reading: Bullish: Shiba Inu Whale Buys 3.48 Trillion SHIB At the time of writing, SHIB was trading at $0.00001153, starting yet another breakout attempt. Shiba Inu investors should look out for a significant increase in volume for confirmation of the move. If SHIB can close above the $0.00001151 resistance today and turn it into support, it could mean that the local high at $0.00001591 from early February is the next likely price target (+38%). At this level, more selling pressure can be expected in the short term. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Set For Breakout From Bull Pattern In April However, if this price level is also broken, the higher high would fully confirm Shiba Inu’s uptrend. After a two-month consolidation, a rise of more than 55% to the local high of August 14, 2022 at $0.00001787 would thus be a second target price. Altcoin Season May Boost SHIB The decisive push above the resistance line could be provided by an altcoin season, which according to some experts is just around the corner. Glassnode co-founders Jan Happel and Yann Allemann write in their latest newsletter: Currently, altcoins are exposed to bitcoin pull-backs – like the one we saw today – given its dominance according to the Altcoin Cycle Signal. The tides are shifting toward ethereum. Accordingly, the typical shift from Bitcoin to Ethereum to altcoins like Shiba Inu could be imminent. As analyst Scott Melker recently discussed, the Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) is at the upper end of a multi-year range. The last few days have already seen the first drop in BTC.D, which could mark the beginning of an altcoin season.

The 21-page paper noted that although 90% of the world's central banks are examining CBDCs, only a small number have issued one.  Earlier, the central banks of Israel, Norway and Sweden teamed up with the Bank for International Settlements to complete a study of how CBDCs can be used for international retail and remittance payments.

The crypto exchange’s demise cleaned up the final tranche of “toxic crypto leverage” and taught digital-asset investors the importance of decentralization and self-custody wallets, the report said.  Macro catalysts are aligning for bitcoin (BTC), the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap, the note added, with continued weakness in U.S. regional banks and further deposit outflows toward money-market funds and the big four U.S. banks all reflecting concerns about the “centralization of money.”  “Any potential dislocation, whether on the bank’s credit side, or on the sovereign side …positions bitcoin perfectly as a safe-haven asset alongside gold,” analysts Gautam Chhugani and Manas Agrawal wrote.  Bitcoin has rallied 80% this year – with prices surging 23% in March amid multiple bank failures in the U.S. Ethereum’s native token ether (ETH) is up 76% year-to-date, according to CoinDesk data.  Ethereum implemented its highly anticipated Shapella hard fork last week, opening the doors for users to stake and unstake ether at will. Ether rallied 13% after the software upgrade, lifting the broader market higher.  The Ethereum blockchain’s fees are up threefold, “reflecting the growing user intensity and token prices, post FTX,” the note said.  According to Bernstein, the new crypto cycle is still not fully appreciated, with a number of positive factors lining up. These include macro catalysts, a new bitcoin mining cycle, the continued successful upgrades of the Ethereum blockchain and the success of Ethereum scaling products such as Arbitrum.  “The opportunity to build a new institutional financial stack on the blockchain remains a worthy goal, and serious participants remain focused on the long term,” the analysts wrote, adding that this will be the “first crypto cycle which will see participation from leading institutional investors.""",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Will Canny,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/04/18/the-biggest-crypto-bull-cycle-is-upon-us-bernstein,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ac67869cdb63df405867fc280640567b4e0d6a5d-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

As traders and investors alike rushed to get their hands on the new asset, OKB’s value experienced an unexpected surge. However, despite the sudden spike in price, an interesting trend was noted: there was no notable uptick in active addresses during this period. This peculiar phenomenon has left many wondering about the true drivers behind OKB’s recent surge and what it could mean for the future of this digital asset. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Retreats To $29,000 Level – Further Drop Imminent? SUI Launch Triggers Positive Movement For OKB Recent reports reveal that the Sui network has launched its SUI token, but with a surprising twist – instead of the expected airdrops, the tokens are now available for sale. The sale is being conducted through selected exchanges, including OKX exchange, which is offering rewards to SUI supporters. The sale of SUI tokens has triggered a positive trend for OKB, with its price on Coingecko experiencing a modest rally of 2.2% to reach $53.49. Over the last seven days, OKB has seen a significant surge in value with a rally of 23.5%, which is promising for investors seeking to capitalize on the digital currency’s upward momentum. Early adopters of the SUI ecosystem have the opportunity to purchase tokens at $0.03, while regular users can buy them at $0.1. Notably, OKB tokens are the accepted currency for making these purchases. OKB Price And Volume Up, But Active Addresses Flat Despite the remarkable increase in both the price and volume of OKB, there has been no significant upswing in the active address metric. As per the OKX active addresses metric, there was a consistent level of activity, with roughly 358 active addresses at the time of writing. Cryptocurrencies total market cap currently at $1.22 billion on the daily chart at TradingView.com Related Reading: Dogecoin 12% Rally Threatened By Potential Price Drop – Here’s Why One plausible explanation for this could be that the price rise may have been driven by institutional investors or whales with large holdings, rather than individual users. These investors may have traded OKB without necessarily increasing the number of unique active addresses on the network. Another reason could be that users may have simply been holding onto their OKB, rather than actively trading or transacting with it. Thus, while the surge in price and volume is an encouraging sign for the OKB market, it is crucial to keep a close eye on the active address metric to assess the true health and growth of the network. -Featured image from DailyCoin",NEUTRAL,OKB | SUI,BUSINESS | ICO | TRADING | OKB | SUI,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/okb-tallies-24-increase-but-active-addresses-fail-to-keep-pace-heres-why/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/11881558.jpeg

On the daily chart, the altcoin noted a 4% increase. During this time, DOT was consolidating between $5.40 and $6.40, but once it breached the $6.40 mark, its price started to move north. Currently, Polkadot is hovering just below the psychological barrier of $7. If it manages to move above this level, it will face another crucial resistance mark, which, if surpassed, can potentially lead to a rally in its price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bearish Signal: Exchange Whale Ratio Spikes The technical outlook for Polkadot is bullish, indicating that the altcoin has the potential to move higher. Additionally, there has been a recovery in demand over the past few days, and accumulation has been high, which is a positive sign for the altcoin’s price. The market capitalization of DOT has also increased, which indicates that there is a higher demand for the altcoin. However, bullish sentiment for DOT is largely dependent on the broader market strength and Bitcoin’s movement above $30,000. Bitcoin’s movement can have a positive impact on the altcoin market, which can lead to an increase in the DOT price. Polkadot Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, DOT was trading at $6.90, having taken a bullish turn after breaking past the $6.60 mark. The next overhead resistance is at $7, followed by a crucial resistance at $7.60, which marks a bearish order block characterized by an influx of sellers. On the downside, support for the altcoin stands at $6.50. A further decline can bring the price to $6.30. The trading volume of Polkadot in the last session was green, indicating positive demand for the altcoin. However, breaching the resistance levels will be crucial for DOT to continue its bullish run. Technical Analysis The altcoin witnessed a notable increase in buying strength, with a sharp u-turn in demand. At the time of writing, the Relative Strength Index was above 60, indicating that buyers had overtaken sellers. This was further supported by the price of the asset moving above the 20-Simple Moving Average line, suggesting that buyers were driving the price momentum in the market. This indicated that investors were bullish on the altcoin, and it may continue to rise in the near future. DOT was displaying bullish buy signals at the time of writing, in line with other positive technical indicators. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicated the price momentum and potential trend reversal, with green histograms that were increasing in size. Related Reading: 20% Rally Possible For Avalanche If It Surpasses This Key Resistance Level These histograms were tied to buy signals for the altcoin.

LTC could rise further if there is a clear move above the $105 resistance zone. Litecoin started a fresh increase above the $98 zone against the US Dollar. The price is now trading above $98 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). There is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $100 on the 4-hour chart of the LTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The price could start another surge if there is a clear move above the $105 resistance. Litecoin Price Eyes Steady increase This past week, Litecoin’s price formed a support base above the $95 level against the US Dollar. LTC price started a steady increase above the $98 resistance zone, similar to Bitcoin and Ethereum. The bulls were able to push the price above the $100 resistance. A high is formed near $102.90 and the price is now consolidating gains. It is trading well above $98 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support near $100 on the 4-hour chart of the LTC/USD pair. The trend line is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $97.35 swing low to the $102.90 high. On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $103 zone. The next major resistance is near the $105 level. If there is a clear break above the $105 resistance, the price could start another strong increase. Source: LTCUSD on TradingView.com In the stated case, the price is likely to continue higher toward the $112 and $115 levels. Any more gains might send LTC’s price toward the $120 resistance zone. Are Dips Supported in LTC? If Litecoin price fails to clear the $105 resistance level, there could be a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $100 level and the trend line. The next major support is forming near the $98 level or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $97.35 swing low to the $102.90 high, below which there is a risk of a move toward the $95 support. Any further losses may perhaps send the price toward the $92 support. Technical indicators: 4-hour MACD – The MACD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone. 4-hour RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for LTC/USD is above the 50 level.

42413995,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAoIf4,1681795792,'Pepe the Frog' Meme Coins Rocket as Crypto Twitter Moves Over Dogecoin Obsession,"The most degen of Crypto Twitter traders seem to be moving over Shiba Inu-fashioned tokens to those branded after the internet meme Pepe the Frog.  A pepe (PEPE) token launched Sunday ran over 21,000% in the past three days, raking in $30 million in trading volumes on Uniswap and reaching a market capitalization of as high as $33 million on Tuesday morning.  “The most memeable memecoin in existence. The dogs have had their day, it’s time for Pepe to take reign,” [sic] the Pepe website says.  Pepe hit 10,000 individual holders on Tuesday, data from blockchain tracker Etherscan shows, meaning the token was quickly purchased by swathes of investors participating in the ongoing frenzy – and pinning hopes on turning a profit.  The tokens have a circulating supply of 420 trillion, a reference to ""4/20,"" another popular cannabis culture slang. The trading action is rather serious for a token intended to be a complete joke: a trading pool on Uniswap for Pepe tokens locks up over $1.3 million in liquidity, all supplied by providers.  As such, the tokens have no connection to the actual Pepe the Frog meme or Matt Furie, the meme’s original creator.  Furie’s Pepe, a green frog with a humanoid body, originated in the 2005 comic Boy's Club. It went viral in the years following, becoming a popular part of internet culture.  Crypto Twitter has a knack for jumping on memecoins, mainly after the rise of tokens such as dogecoin (DOGE) and shiba inu (SHIB) – which jumped to tens of billions in market capitalization in the previous bull market.  Most of these do not last beyond a few weeks. Last year saw hopefuls bet on articles from the English language to McDonald’s branded Grimacecoins.  Anyone can call a smart contract and issue tokens on Ethereum (or other blockchains) for a few cents, and the presence of decentralized exchanges means tokens can instantly be issued, supplied with liquidity and traded soon after.  Some professional investors have previously told CoinDesk that meme coins and their narratives will always remain a part of the crypto ecosystem.  “Meme coins are huge parts of the crypto trading landscape, whether we like it or not,” James Wo, founder at crypto fund DFG, told CoinDesk at the heights of one such meme obsession. “While the biggest currencies like bitcoin and ether have very low volatility, it's only natural that traders will look for opportunities elsewhere.”  “Meme trading is a risky way to try to seek excessive return, but when it pans out, the upside can be very huge. So even in a bear market, some of the meme coins will have large up-swing, even if it's just short term,” Wo explained.  The premise doesn’t matter: if there’s money to be made peddling trendy topics; expect a market for it somewhere in niche ""s**tcoin"" circles.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/04/18/pepe-the-frog-memecoins-rocket-as-crypto-twitter-moves-over-doge-obsession,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/883c6959cddebbb4f7ab43b2ac97f3cc6d09d05b-800x544.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42413992,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAoIP9,1681795108,Hong Kong's Central Bank Digital Currency Could Be on Permissioned Blockchain: Source,"Hong Kong is stepping up efforts to develop its own central bank digital currency this year, but the regulator has left the nature of the ledger itself – fully centralized or decentralized – up to the banks.  At least one major bank is leaning toward developing an e-HKD on a permissioned blockchain, an official within the bank told CoinDesk.  Unlike the People Bank of China’s e-CNY, the architecture of Hong Kong’s central bank digital currency (CBDC) hasn't been dictated by the central government, said the Hong Kong-based bank official, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the issue.  The regulator has left implementation up to Hong Kong banks. “They are allowed to go and review and research and then propose back,” the source said.  The e-HKD will likely be developed “without the public making a decision as to what they really want,” the source added.  Last year, HKMA issued a discussion paper inviting views on issues surrounding a retail CBDC.  Whether the e-HKD will be issued on a permissioned or permissionless chain has huge security and privacy implications.  On a permissionless chain, while the authorities could require banks to freeze accounts, if the person in question withdraws assets to a self-custody wallet, the authorities cannot seize the assets. On a permissioned chain, the authorities could seize those assets.  Hong Kong is currently a cash-heavy society where hailing a taxi generally requires cash on hand.

After a week-long rise above $30,000, bitcoin dipped below the symbolic threshold.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $29,400, down about 1.9% over the past 24 hours. BTC dipped below $29,300 at one point as banking unrest subsided, treasury yields rose and investors shied away from riskier assets.  ""Cryptos are losing some appeal as banking turmoil risks appear to be disappearing,"" Edward Moya, senior analyst at foreign exchange market maker Oanda, wrote in an email. ""[Federal Reserve] lending to banks continues to ease and earnings have not revealed any major strains with the early banks that have reported. Also dampening the appeal for crypto is the surge behind Treasury yields, which is dampening the appeal for most risky assets.""  Moya noted that a number of major banks reported solid first-quarter earnings, including Wells Fargo and Citigroup, and that ""emergency lending is decreasing.""  ""The mid and small banks are about to report and while we are about to see some serious deposit outflows, the focus is not on bank solvency, but on banking profitability,"" Moya wrote.  Ether was recently changing hands at about $2,075, off the better part of a percentage point. The second-largest crypto in market value has yet to see many ill effects from the recent Ethereum Shanghai upgrade, the final step in the blockchain platform's transformation from a proof-of-work to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake protocol.  Other major cryptos were in the red, albeit lightly so. ARB, the token of the layer 2 Ethereum scaling protocol Arbitrum, and ADA, the native crypto of the Cardano blockchain, both recently declined about 3%. The CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of the crypto markets overall performance, was recently down 1.6%.  Equity markets inched upward as investors chewed over the encouraging bank earnings and the possibility that the U.S. central bank might continue raising interest rates to tame inflation. In last month's near banking meltdown, that prescription seemed less likely. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield has increased for three straight days to 3.59%, while gold, which a week ago neared its all-time high, has edged downward to just above $2,000.  Oanda's Moya was wary about bitcoin's near-future path forward. ""Bitcoin looks like it might be consolidating, possibly settling on a new range between the $26,500 and $31,000 region,"" he wrote.

The percentage of people who have “ever invested in, traded or used a cryptocurrency such as bitcoin or ether” has remained roughly 16% since 2020. But this spring, Pew sought to identify how people feel about crypto. Among the 88% who have ever heard of cryptocurrency, 75% are “not very or not at all confident that cryptocurrencies are reliable or safe.” Only 6% are very confident.  Trust in crypto is very low.  The CoinDesk editorial team didn’t need a poll to see this. Our Most Influential 2022 list, published in December, subjectively identified the 50 people who defined the year in crypto. A significant percentage of the list was feel-bad stories of scammers and hucksters and possible sociopaths who depleted customers’ savings. The list came out less than a month after the sudden and shocking collapse of the FTX exchange, capping off a year of scandals. Understandably in response, Congress, mainstream media and the public are ready to punish crypto.  To state the obvious, 2022 was the antithesis of crypto, which was invented as a remedy in 2009 to broken global financial systems and not to make sharks and charlatans rich. Bitcoin made peer-to-peer transactions possible, bypassing banks that make the transfers slow, costly and intrusive. By solving the trusted-mediator problem, bitcoin allowed transactions to be quicker and cheaper and therefore more accessible.  The CoinDesk team set about to find projects that fulfill the ethos of crypto by solving a problem. In brainstorming sessions, we debated what problems crypto could be employed to solve, which quickly split into two baskets: problems within the crypto ecosystem itself, and problems in the world generally.  Then the team explored the merits of projects aiming to solve the identified problems. From a list of more than 35 projects, we selected 19. Some haven’t launched yet, while others have been around for years. Funding ranges from bootstrapped to tens of millions of dollars, to undisclosed support from a parent foundation or project. We didn't put a lot of restrictions or parameters on these projects. Crypto organizations come in many forms, from traditional startups to decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) to major corporations. It is still relatively new and many of its brands – even if valued in the billions of dollars – are not widely recognized.  What the CoinDesk team looked for are innovative ideas, convincing proposals or evidence of success, and talented, committed people. Moreover, the problems the projects were aiming to solve had to be real, and the remedies needed. They could not just be a crypto version of something that is adequately managed in traditional finance, for instance, or purely meant for speculation or fun.

In an interview on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” program on Monday, Lunde said that ""the current drawdown and recovery stage is remarkably similar to that in 2019, both in duration and price movement.”  In a research note to clients last week, Lunde wrote that bitcoin could reach $45,000. BTC was currently trading at about $29,440, down 2%, although it is up about 80% in 2023. The rebound follows a year of distress, in which multiple major firms declared bankruptcy, sending risk-shy investors fleeing from crypto markets.  Read More: Bitcoin Could Peak at $45K in May, Analyst Says  “We saw throughout the latter part of 2022 a lot of forced selling, and also selling from investors who grew cautious,” Lunde said. “This has led people to be underexposed. And has also enticed a lot of people to short (crypto) being conservative with adding exposure. This creates this dynamic where bitcoin feeds on your short squeezes and moves higher.”  He added that negative to neutral sales of derivatives, despite recent price gains, were further signs of investor caution. That sentiment could change, although the market’s relatively low liquidity remained a potential weight on future pricing.  Lunde believes that faint signs last week that the U.S. Federal Reserve would scale back its hawkish monetary policy amid mildly encouraging inflation data could boost market sentiment.  He blamed crypto prices’ swoon last year partly on firms overexposing themselves when interest rates were zero.  “It was a lot of spending, a lot of focus on growth,” Lunde said. “So you had this environment where miners took a lot of fiat that held a lot of bitcoin and then were exposed to falling prices, in addition to all the crypto banks starting to neglect due diligence.”  But the industry-wide crisis of 2022, which included multiple, major firms declaring bankruptcy, including crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, has already been benefiting markets by weeding out bad actors, Lunde suggested. “A lot of these rotten fruits have been washed out of the market,” he said. “So the entire market is in a more robust stage right now where it can handle higher interest rates for longer.”  He added: “The industry has learned. I'm pretty sure that we will experience similar kinds of crisis in the future, unfortunately. But for now, those kinds of risks feel washed out of the market. So the market feels a lot more safe at the moment.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/04/18/bitcoin-surge-parallels-price-movement-in-2019-analyst,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ee0b0ed87e436eed45529061090d10cfa4cdd05a-1412x794.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This means anyone can use that email address – saylor@microstrategy.com – to send bitcoin (BTC) to the 58-year-old billionaire.

The Lightning Network is the Bitcoin blockchain’s layer 2 scaling system designed to make bitcoin payments cheaper and faster.
