42378285,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7fhZl,1440711736,Blockstack.io on Wall Street's Budding Blockchain Interest,"""What can the blockchain do for me today?""  It's a question that's increasingly being asked by major financial institutions, and one that San Francisco-based Blockstack.io has been focused on finding an answer for since its launch in June.  One of a growing number of companies seeking to provide custom blockchain solutions, Blockstack.io boasts unique expertise in Standard Chartered Bank veteran Peter Shiau, who serves as the company's CEO.  Shiau indicates that Blockstack.io is seeking to capitalize on the ""thought shift"" currently underway at major financial institutions, which by all accounts are becoming increasingly aware of the potential payoffs from utilizing blockchain-based systems as distributed databases.  Shiau told CoinDesk:  ""This is a software stack to enable financial services to have a private isolated blockchain...that became exciting to financial institutions, because now they can start working on applications and back-office systems.""  Blockstack.io is one of a new wave of blockchain-first tech services firms seeking to partner with financial institutions on initiatives involving the technology, a group that prominently includes names such as Chain, Eris Ltd, Gem and Digital Asset Holdings, among others.  CTO and former Google engineer Miron Cuperman indicated that Blockstack.io is currently seeking to educate its potential clients so they can understand applications for the blockchain in commodities, equities, clearing and trading, emphasizing that the company is seeking to make the case the technology is actionable today.  Shiau said Blockstack.io's goal is to replicate the success of Red Hat, the open-source software company that helped commercialize the Linux operating system in the 1990s.  ""They made [software] something that could be consumed and used by all enterprises,"" he said. ""That's what we aim to do – take that tech that is proven and put it together in a way that is useable for that community.""  Blockstack.io today  But, while much has been said about private blockchains, little has been perhaps made public about the exact design features that are sought after by financial institutions.  Adding to the lack of certainty is that many of the firms exploring the technology are tight-lipped about any trials being conducted. For example, while Barclays and UBS are known to be experimenting with Ethereum, neither disclosed exactly how they are seeking to use the decentralized application platform.  Blockstack.io, however, provided a deeper dive into its technology, describing its solution as a ""private, isolated blockchain"" with access to core ""blockchain functionality"" through APIs.  The platform provides four functions, according to the team: a private ledger based on Bitcoin Core and optimized for high transaction volume; asset issuance to represent real-world assets; transaction management that allows users to describe transaction flows between parties; and multi-signature wallet security.  ""Using these functions, a financial institution can model existing work flows in the lifecycle of common transactions,"" the company explained.  While Shiau said it would consider adding support for other blockchains to its solution, he indicated that the bitcoin blockchain remains the best option for clients today.  ""Bitcoin Core is proven software and we know that it works and we want to be able to take advantage of the improvements in the bitcoin ecosystem,"" he continued, calling it is the most ""robust and reliable"" blockchain to date.  The firm's existing experience with bitcoin, he said, would further enable Blockstack.io to update client blockchains with the best innovations from bitcoin:  ""There are other approaches are definitely interesting and there's merit in exploring these alternatives, but if you're a financial institution, you're looking to enhance the architecture you have today.""  Internet of blockchains  Shiau also went on to address a lingering question in the bitcoin ecosystem, whether it's best to consider private blockchains as intranets, or private versions of a public good like the Internet that will eventually be replaced as users become more comfortable with the technology.  For now, Shiau said he is unsure if private blockchains will want to connect with each other or with a public blockchain, like bitcoin. Ultimately, however, he suggested both ""flavors"" of the technology offer advantages. While bitcoin boasts security, he said private blockchains offer faster transaction times.  ""The bitcoin network has its value, it allows you to exchange value in a trustless environment without counterparty risk. That was the original purpose in the paper, and to the extent that people want that, there is value in that,"" he continued.  He suggested the sidechains project, currently being spearheaded by Blockstream, could increase bitcoin's functionality, but just as easily be replicated on other distributed ledger systems.  Equally, Shiau said he sees value in permissioned distributed ledgers, cautioning that the systems are not mutually exclusive.  ""You can imagine an exchange where commodities are traded, and an equity exchange, they might want to connect. You can imagine a world where these private isolated chains can talk to each other, because there have these different assets,"" he said, concluding:  ""I can see a future where at least the isolated blockchains will want to talk to each other.""

The site outlined its latest additions in a new blog post, a list that also included ""hangry"", ""butt-dial"", ""Redditor"", ""rage-quit"" and ""bants"", among others.  A ""blockchain"", according to the site, is a noun defined as:  ""A digital ledger in which transactions made in bitcoin or another cryptocurrency are recorded chronologically and publicly.""  The resource added new definitions for terms related to bitcoin mining as well, according to Katherine Connor Martin, head of US dictionaries for the Oxford University Press.  The updated definition for the noun ""miner"" includes:  ""A person who obtains units of a cryptocurrency by running computer processes to solve specific mathematical problems.""  The verb ""mine"" has a new section as well:  ""[To] obtain units of (a cryptocurrency) by running a computer process to solve specific mathematical problems.""  The inclusions come roughly two years after the site added ""bitcoin"" to its list of definitions.  OxfordDictionaries.com is distinct from the Oxford English Dictionary. According to its publisher, whereas the site ""focuses on the current language and practical usage"", the Oxford English Dictionary is aimed at portraying ""how words and meanings have changed over time"".

42378292,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7fhg3,1440701108,Research Examines Blockchain Securities Under US Commercial Law,"Cryptosecurities and blockchain recordkeeping systems may not be subject to commercial transactions law under the US Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), according to new research from Cardozo Law.  Penned by professor Jeanne Schroeder, the 60-page research paper, released this week, provides a wide-ranging overview of how bitcoin transactions, both financial and non-financial, would be governed by laws relating to the exchange of property across US states.  The paper is the latest to highlight potential legal issues that could arise in disputes over ownership of cryptographic assets, such as bitcoin, following research by law firm Perkins Coie in January. At issue is that bitcoin does not fit the UCC's definition of money and challenges conventional notions of custody.  The UCC, first published in 1952, was created by private legal institutions seeking to harmonize state laws regarding commercial transactions. States may adopt the UCC as written or approve or deny specific changes to its provisions.  While the paper echoes many of Perkin Coie's conclusions, it is perhaps one of the first to speculate on how the UCC would apply to alternative uses of blockchains. For example, Schroeder cites decentralized application platform Ethereum and Overstock's tØ as a platform designed to enable the use of tokens outside of currency and payments.  The paper remarks that such transactions could be filed on a blockchain without any amendments to the UCC, stating:  ""There is no reason under the language of the UCC that a state’s filing office, usually the Secretary of State, could not establish a blockchain recording system [in which] recording on the blockchain would constitute filing with that office. Similarly, there is no reason why requirements for numbering, maintaining and indexing records and communicating information provided in records could not be met through an electronic ledger system.""  Schroeder suggested such a system may prove ""more efficient and accurate"" than those in place, while still providing US states the ability to collect filing fees through smart contracts.  ""We could continue the practice whereby a filing fee must be paid to the state of the debtor’s location,"" the paper reads. ""A 'smart' blockchain ledger could be programmed to allow secured parties to automatically transfer filing fees to the Secretary of State of the jurisdiction of the debtor’s location by transferring funds on the blockchain itself.""  Amendment needed  The finding stands in contrast to the paper's less favorable conclusion that the UCC would need to be amended for bitcoin to be used as a payment system.  ""Cryptocurrency do not, nor can they be made to, fit within Article 9's definition of 'money',"" the report reads, echoing previous findings.  Building on this remark, the author indicated bitcoin is currently defined as a ""general intangible"" asset under the UCC. As pointed out by Perkins Coie, this means that, unlike cash, legal claims on the asset can continue to be valid even after it is transferred.  The legal interest, the author said, can continue regardless of how many times a specific bitcoin changes owners.  ""Unlike virtually every other category of personal property recognized by Article 9, once a general intangible becomes encumbered by a security interest, it can never become unencumbered even by transfer to a bonafide purchaser for value,"" the report reads, adding:  ""This could greatly impinge on bitcoin’s liquidity and, therefore, its utility as a payment system.""  The paper argues general intangible assets are ill-equipped to function as money, as in the exchange of paper currencies, claims on the assets are relinquished at the time of exchange.  Cryptosecurities covered  In contrast, the author argues the UCC as currently drafted can easily accommodate the development of cryptosecurities, or assets traded on a blockchain.  The technology is currently being pioneered in various forms by major US stock market Nasdaq, online retail giant Overstock and 'smart securities' startup Symbiont.  Schroeder indicated cryptosecurities would fall under the UCC's definition of ""uncertificated securities"", which were meant to cover securities represented not as physical stock certifications, but on the books of a specific corporation.  ""Article 8's failed uncertificated security regime, which was reformed in 1994, may be given a new life because it permit the issuance and trading of blockchain cryptosecurities in the direct ownership regime,"" the paper continues. ""It is ironic that the drafters who could not understand their own present, may have ended up predicting the future.""  However, the paper suggests the custody of a cryptosecurity could also affect the specific UCC provisions under which it is covered, thereby altering definitions they could be afforded.  Hand-to-hand currency  The paper goes on to imply that, even though bitcoin aspires to be a digital form of cash, the UCC contains wording that currently excludes it from acting as such.  ""The problem is that, although inartfully drafted, in context it is clear that the term is limited to physical, or 'hand-to-hand', currency,"" it reads. ""Characterizing bitcoin as money would have a perverse effect because security interests in money can only be perfected by physical custody.""  Bitcoin could be given what the author terms the ""super-negotiation"" status of physical currencies, but such a change would require alterations to the text, according to the report.  Specifically, Schroeder contends that the UCC would need to be updated to include a definition of cryptocurrency, a definition of custody of cryptocurrencies and priority rules with regards to securities interests with the digital assets, among other changes.  Still, the author suggests this problem could be circumvented if bitcoins were held by third-party brokers or banks, at which point they could qualify as ""financial assets"", which are covered by super-negotiation rules.  ""Unfortunately, to do so would defeat one of the greatest attractions of bitcoin – the ability to transfer value directly between parties without the use, and expense, of third-party intermediaries,"" the paper concludes.

42378286,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7fhYV,1440680592,BTCChina Support Gives BIP 100 Bitcoin Hashrate Majority,"UPDATE (28th August 14:21 BST): Mining firm 21 Inc, which accounts for over 7% of the current bitcoin hashrate, has also noted its support for BIP 100. Garzik's proposal now has 58.6% of the network's hashing power behind it.  UPDATE (28th August 13:12 BST): One of the leading transaction processors, KNC Miner, is now tagging its blocks in support of BIP 100. In a statement, the company said it would support both BIP 100 or BIP 101 as they would ""propel bitcoin for all"".      BTCChina has backed Jeff Garzik's block size scaling solution, giving BIP 100 a majority of the network's hashing power.  With the addition of the Chinese bitcoin firm today, the proposal now has support from the top three 'blockmakers' – who account for over 50% of the network's hashrate.  Speaking to CoinDesk, BTCChina CEO Bobby Lee said the company's structure gave it the ability that few others have:  ""We are in the unique position of seeing this from several sides, a mining pool, a wallet service, and an exchange. So we must come forward with a sound perspective, and not just vote quickly for the sake of asking the industry to move on.""  Up until today, the firm – alongside China’s other pools – had been backing the 8MB proposal, however it is now taking issue with the consequences of a sudden step change. In an open letter, to released on its blog today, the company said:  ""BTCChina has experienced firsthand the problems of high orphan rates and the related risks of the blockchain forking. Our perspective is that the Internet today, in China and also globally, is not yet ready for unrestrained, automatic increases of the block size.""    If BIP 100 is adopted by the industry, BTCChina will vote for a 2MB limit, with a view to increase to 8MB in the ""mid-term"". This, the firm says, will give stakeholders time to study any effects the increased block size has on the network and plan ahead accordingly.    BTC China is also one of the sponsors behind a Montreal workshop gathering many bitcoin stakeholders to discuss the pros and cons of various scaling solutions. Lee added:  ""Even though this issue is not fully resolved yet, I have full confidence that we will come together as a community and one solution will emerge that everyone can be happy with.""

42378290,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7fhcH,1440677687,BitFury Backs BIP 100 Blocksize Proposal,"The best-capitalised mining firm in bitcoin has waded into the block size debate – stating it must be resolved by consensus.  BitFury, previously silent on the hot-button issue, said it will join bitcoin's biggest mining pool in backing Jeff Garzik's ""market-led"" BIP 100 proposal, which lets miners 'vote' on the size of each block.  CEO Valery Vavilov told CoinDesk:  ""We think that the block size debate must be resolved by consensus and the voting mechanism introduced in BIP 100 is a good way to achieve such a consensus ... The power to make such future defining decisions must belong to the community.""  BitFury noted its preference with a public 'tag' on the blockchain yesterday afternoon. BIP 100 now has support from over 35% of the bitcoin hashrate, more than any other proposal.  Sizing up the debate  If bitcoin transactions continue to grow at their current rate, the network will hit a 'capacity cliff' in the coming year. How to resolve this, or whether to take any action at all, has sparked a 'flame war' raging for nearly five months.  Following the release of Bitcoin XT, Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn's highly controversial fork to 'opt out' of bitcoin's current 1MB block size limit, industry stakeholders are now picking sides.  In a statement on Monday, several of bitcoin's biggest service providers – including wallets Blockchain, Circle and Xapo – put their weight behind BIP 101, the proposal for an 8MB block size limit that increases over time.  ""BIP101 and 8MB blocks are already supported by a majority of the miners and we feel it is time for the industry to unite behind this proposal. Our companies will be ready for larger blocks by December and we will run code that supports this,"" it read.  While over 39% of the network's hashing power is yet to back any scalability proposal, BitFury rival KnCMiner, alongside several China-based mining pools, is also behind an 8MB increase.  Vavilov is against these proposals, he said, because their growth forecasts don't provide enough ""predictive power"", so the potential cost of mistakes runs extremely high. He added:  ""We believe a substantial part of full nodes right now would not be able to support blocks of this size simply because of hardware limitations. Similarly, we do not support propositions to fork client software as we believe this move may have potential negative consequences for the entire bitcoin ecosystem.""

This was one of the recommendations put forward by the Commonwealth's Virtual Currencies Working Group during a three-day conference held in London this week.  After hearing from the banking sector, academia, virtual currency operators, users and law enforcement agencies, the group urged governments to re-consider their legislative response to virtual currencies such as bitcoin and strengthen law enforcement to counter criminal use.  The group, which noted that virtual currencies have potential benefits and could help drive development, concluded:  ""Member states should consider the applicability of their existing legal frameworks to virtual currencies and where appropriate they should consider adapting them or enacting new legislation to regulate virtual currencies.""  Additionally, the group asked governments to provide education on digital currencies and funding for training law enforcement agents, prosecutors, judges, regulatory authorities and the financial sector.  The group is expected to prepare a report on the prevalence and impact of virtual currencies and plans to reconvene in early 2016 to consider drafting technical guidance on the subject for member states.
