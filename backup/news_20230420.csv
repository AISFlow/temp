The European Parliament passes its MiCA crypto laws. Transactions over 1,000 euros and ICOs to be targeted. I had said in articles since March 2021 that when Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) traded above $60,000, government regulation and central bank digital currencies would hurt the industry. This week took a step closer to ending the decentralized dreams. The IMF introduces its Unicoin currency Just over a week ago, the International Monetary Fund held its annual Spring Meeting, where the Digital Currency Monetary Authority (DCMA) announced the official launch of a new central bank digital currency ((CBDC)). The Universal Monetary Unit (UMU), or Unicoin , will be able to transact SWIFT-like cross-border payments outside of the traditional banking system. In my final sell warning above $60,000, I talked of CBDCs and that Bitcoin and other cryptos were possibly a trojan horse for introducing traceable, programmable digital money. Another analyst to follow on this has been famed forecaster Martin Armstrong, who also said back in 2021 that the IMF was working on a digital currency to dominate the world's currency. His thesis is that this one-world, centralized digital currency is a precursor to a world of less monetary freedom- not decentralization. In Martin Armstrong's article, ""The Bitcoin Delusion, he says: ""The whole blockchain was the perfect creation of a totalitarian state. They can trace everything"". Darrell Hubbard, executive director of the DCMA, touted Unicoin's superiority over sovereign forms of money, saying: ""Unicoin offers the best of both worlds between a cryptocurrency and a CBDC. As a crypto asset, Unicoin adopts monetary policies to ensure it sustains its store of value stronger than any fiat currency..."". This brings us neatly to the next headache for crypto bulls... EU Parliament brings the first sweeping regulation The European Parliament on Thursday passed a vote by 529-to-29 in favor of its Markets in Crypto Asset (MiCA) regulations. The new rules mark a significant step toward the implementation of global crypto regulations and are likely to be followed by tougher laws in the United States. Among the new rules from the EU are measures to clamp down on money laundering, market manipulation, and false advertising. However, there will also be stricter rules over Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and the ability to trace transactions above 1,000 euros. The rules would not apply to peer-to-peer transactions but remove a big chunk of crypto's Universal Selling Point, which was decentralized money and freedom. The EU will now trace all transactions over a measly 1,000 euros that are sent to an exchange. In order to receive the desired approvals to operate in Europe, exchanges will have to hand over their transaction details. It also paves the way for tougher taxation on crypto. The press release added: ""To counter money-laundering risks the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) should set up a public register for non-compliant crypto assets service providers."" Another headache for Bitcoin in the EU laws is also something I spoke about in 2021. The EU press release also said: ""To reduce the high carbon footprint of crypto-currencies, significant service providers will have to disclose their energy consumption"". Bitcoin is obviously not a service provider but politicians in Europe have wanted to ban the energy-intensive proof-of-work (PoW) mining that BTC uses. Bitcoin has been resigned to a trading vehicle The reality for Bitcoin, in my opinion, is that it is now a trading vehicle that was hyped as a decentralized savior of world finance. Crypto has failed as a store of value, failed as an inflation hedge, and the broader industry has failed to avoid the same behavior of greed, manipulation, and abuses that its founders were said to despise. In my opinion, we lurch toward a future where Bitcoin is becoming largely irrelevant but its supporters are unable to see where we are going with regulation, etc. Bitcoin now moves up and down with random news cycles and is increasingly manipulated by whales and futures positioning. An article from CoinDesk on the latest dip highlights the confusion about what the coin is meant to represent: While the sell-off didn't appear to stem from any fundamental reason immediately, an unusually large sell order on crypto exchange Binance and an unexpectedly high U.K. March inflation figure of more than 10% may have influenced market sentiment. I actually report on the weekly trading moves and called the push to $30,000 but I have no desire to hold the coin beyond the short term. The price of Bitcoin rallied hard in 2023 with tax-loss harvesting and a big short squeeze but it has stalled once again. The reason for the consolidation is that there is zero interest beyond small, speculative investments. Warren Buffett recently likened Bitcoin to playing roulette and said it has ""no intrinsic value"". His statements don't go down well in the crypto world but let's get real. Buffett would be one of the first to know if an institutional push into crypto was coming. Another example is that investors even ignore the comments of the CEO of America's largest investment bank Jamie Dimon who calls Bitcoin a ""pet rock"". “I think all that’s been a waste of time and why you guys waste any breath on it is totally beyond me,” h e told CNBC . Conclusion Bitcoin bulls have had a bad week with the introduction of an IMF CBDC and the approval of the European Union's new crypto regulations. We are edging closer to centralized, traceable digital currencies and BTC is also a sitting duck for its energy usage. The weekly ups and downs of BTC are speculative and investors should see that regulation is there to support, but also stifle the industry's growth. There is a very, very slim chance of Bitcoin hitting $100k and even that would only be a 5x investment opportunity. China has been opposed to a decentralized currency with its digital yuan, the IMF believes it can beat sovereign fiats with Unicoin and the EU will trace all of your transactions in small amounts for tax. In my opinion, Bitcoin has lost its USP and is now only used for trading.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | REGULATION | SPONSORED | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4595438-its-been-a-bad-week-for-bitcoin-bulls?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/11965133.jpeg

42420805,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqmDt,1682029652,Bitcoin Tumbles Below $28K on Coinbase,"Bitcoin dropped below $28,000 at one point Thursday as the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization continued its two-day slump.  Bitcoin (BTC) was recently trading at around $28,325, down 2.7% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk market data. The BTC/USD trading pair on the Coinbase exchange fell to $27,991 shortly before U.S. equity markets closed but later rebounded, TradingView data showed.  Edward Moya, senior market analyst for foreign exchange market maker Oanda, noted in an email that bitcoin's recent decline came after Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong indicated that the crypto exchange giant might leave the U.S.  ""Coinbase was able to secure a license to operate in Bermuda, in what is being considered a part of their global push,"" Moya wrote. ""If Coinbase leaves the U.S. market, a lot of U.S. traders will be gone because they probably won't feel confident trading on decentralized exchanges, which means the global crypto market will shrink significantly.""  He added: ""Bitcoin will struggle here until we have any regulatory clarity, which means prices seem poised to drift lower.""  Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, recently dropped nearly a percentage point to change hands at around $1,948. ETH fell to $1,917 at one point, its lowest point in a week.  BTC and ETH were down 7% and 3%, respectively, for the past seven days.  Most other major tokens were trading in the red, with both payments-focused cryptocurrency XRP and litecoin (LTC) recently down over 5%. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), which measures overall crypto market performance, was down 3.9% for the day.  Equity markets also declined, amid a series of disappointing first-quarter earnings, including car maker Tesla, whose revenue fell slightly short of the consensus estimate, and Blackstone, the world’s largest alternative asset manager. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite fell 0.6% and 0.8%, respectively for the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) was down 0.3%.

However, interestingly SHIB has shown no reaction to the whale’s buying spree. Over the past 24 hours, Shiba Inu hasn’t made any significant move aside from a continuous downward trend. SHIB is currently down by nearly 6%, alongside the rest of the crypto market. Its trading volume has increased, indicating ongoing selling pressure. Related Reading: Bullish: Shiba Inu Whale Buys 3.48 Trillion SHIB Whales Buying Frenzy On Shiba Inu (SHIB) In less than an hour, SHIB whales have purchased nearly 30 billion tokens altogether, according to data from Etherscan. The first large investor in the last hour purchased 4.4 billion tokens from Binance, followed by another investor who purchased 19.9 billion SHIB from Coinbase. Additionally, another investor purchased 48.6 million tokens from Binance. Other large transactions recorded include a transfer of 1.6 billion SHIB tokens, 2 billion tokens, and 13.5 billion transfers between unknown wallets. Notably, this is not the first whale report this week, 3 days ago, a Shiba Inu whale purchased 3.48 trillion SHIB becoming the 29th biggest Shiba Inu holder. The purchase showcased the growing interest of crypto whales on SHIB after the Shibarium Beta Testnet, Puppynet launch. The top 100 Ethereum whales have amassed over $601.2 million worth of SHIB, comprising almost 12% of their combined portfolio. On average, each wallet holds 496,214,650,935 SHIB, with a value slightly exceeding $6 million. Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Momentum Screeches To A Halt: What’s The Outlook? Reason Behind SHIB’s Decline Amid Buying Spree? Despite the buying spree, SHIB has been experiencing a price decline. At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.00001055, down by 5.2% in the last 24 hours. One possible explanation for this latest bearish trend could be the crypto market’s performance, which has affected many altcoins. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency has been experiencing a significant price decline, which has had a ripple effect on the entire market. Another possible factor could be the oversupply of SHIB tokens. Moreover, SHIB has been mirroring other large assets in the past weeks, which may have contributed to the initial price surge. Still, it is common for crypto assets to experience a price correction after a quick spike in their value. Additionally, investors who bought SHIB during the initial hype may have sold their tokens to make a profit, resulting in a price decline. Meanwhile, over the past 3 days, nearly $500 million has been removed from SHIB’s market cap resulting in a further decline in the asset’s market cap valuation. On the other hand, SHIB’s daily trading volume has moved from a low of $196 million in the past 7 days to $284 million in the past 24 hours, indicating possible selling pressure.

Here’s Why,"FTT Token, the native coin of the failed crypto exchange FTX, is experiencing a slide in today’s trading session. While it started the trading day negatively, it showed no recovery and further declined in price, recording up to an 8% loss and finding a spot in the top 3 losers in the sector. Despite its previous week’s rally stemming from news of a potential FTX reopening, FTT has shown investors the other side of the palm by reversing its gains. However, the negative drop in FTT is not peculiar to it alone, as other cryptocurrencies have taken falls and show bearish price action. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bears Steal 3%, Time To DCA? Why Is FTT Token Crashing? The drop in the prices of cryptocurrencies, including FTT, could be attributed to Bitcoin’s negative price action. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap was declining in dominance, but a surge in selling pressure reverted this trend and dragged the rest of the market with it. Yesterday’s trade session saw a drop in Bitcoin price as it failed to hold the key support level at $29,200. This resulted in a free fall of Bitcoin, looking to identify the next support area to hold up. Bitcoin finally found some support at $28,600, although some Altcoins had already suffered the tolling effects from the drop. The Bitcoin fear and greed index had also shifted to a neutral number of 52, indicating a possible sideways movement in the markets. According to Coinmarketcap data, the FTT token trades at $1.9 from its 24-hour highs of $2.0751. While the news of FTX reopening could boost the FTT token price, it is far from conclusive and definite.

At press time, bitcoin was lower by 3.4% over the past 24 hours to $28,200.  Leading declines were the bitcoin miners, with Marathon Digital (MARA) and Riot Platforms (RIOT) stocks both lower by about 10% and Hut 8 Mining (HUT) down by 9%.  Shares of crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) and MicroStrategy (MSTR) – which holds 140,000 bitcoins in its treasury – both fell more than 6%.  While traders may not have been able to point to any specific news on Thursday that set off bitcoin's more than 3% decline, the U.K. consumer price report early Wednesday morning – which unexpectedly showed inflation continuing to hold at above 10% in March – soured the mood among many who were expecting Western central banks to back off of or even begin to reverse their series of rate hikes.  On the other hand, U.S. economic data released Thursday morning showed some weakness. Initial jobless claims rose 5,000 to 245,000 versus expectations for 240,000. The Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Index for April fell to -31.30 versus expectations for -19.2 and against March's read of -23.2. Finally, existing home sales for March fell 2.4% versus forecasts for a rise of 5%.  The next meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is two weeks away and short-term rate traders have priced in a nearly 100% chance of another 25-basis point rate hike. One week ago, trader bets on another rate hike were closer to 70%.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Stephen Alpher,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/04/20/crypto-stocks-post-large-losses-as-bitcoin-price-slides-towards-28k,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5b11a031740de49498024dcfb8ffc8bdc40212ff-1546x870.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42420765,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqm8j,1682023165,"NFT Marketplaces Sales, Users Drop to Lows Not Seen Since 2021, Dune Data Shows","The number of daily users and sales has dipped across non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces over the last week, according to data pulled from analytics platform Dune, reaching new lows not seen since July 2021.  According to a Dune dashboard compiled by NFT researcher SeaLaunch, the number of unique users across top NFT marketplaces including Blur, OpenSea and LooksRare has been steadily declining over the past seven days and dropped to 7,805 on April 19. The number of unique users across NFT marketplaces hasn't been that low since July 31, 2021, when the number of unique users on OpenSea and other marketplaces was recorded at 7,455.  Sales across NFT marketplaces have also dipped over the last seven days, with 16,149 sales recorded on April 19, according to the same data from Dune. The last time the number of sales was that low was on Nov. 9, 2021, when there were 12,910 sales.  It appears that both top marketplaces OpenSea and Blur are seeing notable declines in unique users and sales. According to another dashboard compiled by SeaLaunch, Blur, the pro-focused NFT marketplace, has experienced a shrinking number of sales on its platform this week, counting 5,688 sales on Thursday – its lowest daily sales count in 90 days. The number of Blur daily unique users has also fallen, with 1,777 unique users reported on April 19, the lowest in 90 days.  As for OpenSea, a Dune dashboard compiled by researcher Hildobby shows the number of daily traders has fallen sharply over the last week, hitting 10,640 on April 18. According to the data, OpenSea's daily trader count hasn't dipped below 10,000 since July 2021.  ""Unique daily users are effectively at a low amount historically on both marketplaces,"" SeaLaunch told CoinDesk.  It's unclear why daily users and sales have taken a nosedive across NFT marketplaces. SeaLaunch told CoinDesk that because there has been an observable decrease in activity across marketplaces and users – from pro traders to more casual users – it is most likely that a ""macro scenario"" has impacted trading patterns. SeaLaunch cites ""high gas prices"" and ""tax season liquidity issues"" as possible causes.  ""Other scenarios may also have contributed to this, such as high-volume Blur airdrop farmers reducing the trading volumes and reducing liquidity, and the meme coin trading frenzy in the last days with coins such as PEPE,"" SeaLaunch added.  Hildobby shared similar sentiments with CoinDesk. ""I think it's a combination of factors, but the biggest factors [in my opinion] are that not much interesting has been happening in NFTs lately and rapidly rising gas prices aren't helping.""  Representatives from OpenSea and Blur did not immediately respond to CoinDesk for comment.  Not all metrics appear pessimistic. Trading volume in ether (ETH) across NFT marketplaces has remained relatively stable over the last 30 days, according to data from Dune. SeaLaunch also points out that compared to the number of daily active users across OpenSea and Blur, Uniswap has managed to gain daily active users over the past two weeks.",NEGATIVE,ETH | PEPE,ETH | MARKET | TRADING | PEPE | AIRDROP,Rosie Perper,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/04/20/nft-marketplaces-sales-users-drop-to-lows-not-seen-since-2021-dune-data-shows,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c4a6363b257d6a5263b01f811f0ea648ef5f7611-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The U.S.-based crypto exchange’s custodial arm will pay a 2.6% annual yield on deposits, a related post on Maker’s governance forum said. The proposal forbids Coinbase Custody to rehypothecate – lend, reinvest or use in other ways – the assets in the account.  Coinbase must keep the tokens in cold crypto wallets, the Maker community favored in a parallel vote. Maker will be able to withdraw funds from the vault within 24 hours, and funds in cold storage are insured up to the $500 million limit.  Maker, one of the largest decentralized lending protocols, is led by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), in which holders of its native maker (MKR) token vote on proposals. The protocol also issues the $5 billion DAI stablecoin, backed by some $7 billion worth of assets in Maker’s reserves.  The latest development is part of implementing an earlier decision to transfer up to $1.6 billion USDC to Coinbase to earn yield.

11960632,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=527813,1682020820,"Bitcoin In Danger Zone: Bulls Must Hold $27,700 For Price Recovery, Expert Suggests","After a strong rally that pushed Bitcoin (BTC) over the $31,000 level, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has lost its bullish momentum and retraced to its previous consolidation level of $28,400. The retracement has been accompanied by a decline in trading volume and a decrease in market sentiment, which has led some investors to question the sustainability of the recent uptrend. Related Reading: Polkadot Bears Are Back, Can DOT Revisit $7 Soon? Is The Bull Trend In Jeopardy For Bitcoin? According to the trader and analyst under the pseudonym “CJ,” Bitcoin has faced weakness across its daily highs, indicating a potential reversal in its bullish trend. This has put pressure on bulls, who are now closely monitoring the price action to identify key support levels that must hold to avoid a further price decline. One such support level is the $27,700, which has acted as a strong support floor for BTC. If the price were to break below this level, it could signal a shift in market sentiment and potentially lead to a further decline in price. According to CJ, if BTC fails to push higher from this level, it could be on the cusp of a significant correction since the lows of 16k. Furthermore, CJ advises that investors, whether in a long position or not, should keep a close eye on the bearish price action within the 4-hour and 12-hour Fibonacci Volume Zone (FVG). This zone represents a potential resistance area where Bitcoin could face selling pressure and potentially reverse its bullish trend. If a bearish price action is set up within this zone, CJ suggests it could be an opportunity for investors to enter a short position. On the other hand, if Bitcoin manages to close back above the $29,980 level, CJ believes that the cryptocurrency could be off to the races, indicating a potential continuation of its bullish trend. Is Not All Bad News For BTC CryptoCon, a prominent cryptocurrency analyst, has suggested that it may never see much lower Bitcoin prices than $28,000 ever again. This assertion is based on the VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price), a technical indicator that measures the average price of Bitcoin over a certain period, weighted by its trading volume. According to CryptoCon, Bitcoin has just broken above the VWAP, a bullish signal suggesting a potential reversal in the current trend. As long as this breakout is sustained in the short term, CryptoCon believes that previous market cycles indicate that the only thing that could take Bitcoin back below $28,000 is a black swan. On the other hand, CryptoCon has pointed out that while Bitcoin has risen thousands of dollars without experiencing a healthy pullback, the 3 Week Bollinger Bands still indicate that a return to the upper band is likely currently at $35,790, as seen in the chart below. According to CryptoCon, previous market cycles have shown that there were no large corrections until the upper band was reached, so if CryptoCon’s analysis is correct, it could suggest that Bitcoin is entering a new phase of its market cycle, which could potentially lead to further price and investor interest increase.

The Thursday staff bulletin – outlining the duties the advisers have to customers – specifically mentioned crypto, continuing the agency’s recent focus on the sector after having largely ignored digital assets in its rules and guidance until last year.  “Certain products are more complex or have additional risk features, which may make it more difficult for firms and their financial professionals to develop an understanding,” according to the SEC guidance, and “crypto asset securities” are among the examples provided. So when brokers or advisers talk to customers about crypto, the advisers must ensure those they’re advising understand the products and whether crypto offerings make sense for clients’ specific financial situations, according to the bulletin, which represents the staff’s view on existing regulations and isn’t a new rule.  In February, the SEC also proposed a rule that investment advisers registered with the agency must keep clients’ crypto assets with a “qualified custodian,” which Chair Gary Gensler said will almost certainly leave out existing crypto platforms. In the SEC’s view, that generally means keeping the assets with a chartered bank or trust company or a broker-dealer registered with the agency – potentially meaning the SEC is seeking to effectively sever the advisers from the crypto sector.",NEUTRAL,없음,EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/04/20/us-sec-warns-advisers-they-need-to-know-crypto-before-recommending-to-clients,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3c75cbc8b72fe918846e5934437c10f8143eefe1-4021x2262.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

11958293,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=527799,1682015451,"Cardano In Strong Demand Zone, Breaking Through Key Level Crucial","The Cardano price has yet to turn completely bearish, but the bulls have abandoned the current price level. This has caused ADA to lose almost 3% in the last 24 hours. Despite this decline, the altcoin has retained some gains on the weekly chart, although most of these gains have been wiped out due to the recent price drop. The technical outlook suggests that ADA may soon fall into the hands of sellers as a drop has followed a slight decline in demand in accumulation. Related Reading: Polkadot Bears Are Back, Can DOT Revisit $7 Soon? While Cardano is still in a demand zone, breaching its immediate resistance mark could allow the bulls to regain control in subsequent trading sessions. With Bitcoin’s price falling below the $30,000 mark, other altcoins have also slipped below their immediate support level. However, if ADA can surpass the $0.42 level, it has the potential to rally significantly. A decline in ADA’s market capitalization indicates short selling on the one-day chart. Cardano Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, ADA was trading at $0.41. Overhead resistance for the altcoin stands at $0.42. A move above this level could potentially push the price to $0.46. Breaching $0.46 might even result in ADA revisiting $0.50. Cardano is currently within a strong demand zone, from $0.30 to $0.42. However, a drop from the current level could lead to a decline in price to $0.33. Falling from $0.33 may cause ADA to fall further to $0.30. In the last session, the amount of Cardano traded was red, indicating increased selling pressure and volume. Technical Analysis The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum indicator that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions in the market. The RSI formed a downtick in this case and stood below the 60-mark. This meant that the buying strength for Cardano was slowly fading out, indicating a shift in the market sentiment toward selling pressure. At the time of writing, as demand for Cardano started to fall. The cryptocurrency began displaying sell signals. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) formed red histograms. This indicated that sell signals were being generated on the chart. In addition, Bollinger Bands, which measures an asset’s price volatility and fluctuation, began to widen, suggesting that Cardano’s price may encounter increased volatility. Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Momentum Screeches To A Halt: What’s The Outlook? The upper band of the Bollinger Bands indicator will now act as crucial resistance for Cardano.

11956230,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=527776,1682010000,Stablecoin Market Share Dwindles As USDC And BUSD Supply Deplete,"The top 4 stablecoin valuations have declined significantly since this year. USDC and BUSD supply has depleted by $31 billion, pushing down the overall stablecoin market share. In addition, the top 4 stablecoins’ market capitalization has dropped by 23% from a peak of $161 billion per Glassnode’s report. The report noted the major cause of the shrinking stablecoin market cap is the dwindling supply of USDC and BUSD. USDT Dominance Increases As BUSD And USDC Supply Shrink The stablecoin market has faced its share of challenges this year, partly due to regulatory roadblocks on BUSD and USDC. BUSD’s supply has reduced since its issuer Paxos suspended minting after receiving a desist order from US regulators. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bearish Signal: Supply Older Than 7 Years On The Move Also, Circle announced that $3.3 billion of USDCs are stuck on Silicon Valley Bank. As a result, the aggregate market cap of the top four stablecoins fell from $161 billion by 23%. According to Glassnode’s report, USDC circulating supply has declined by $20 billion while BUSD’s reduced by $11 billion from their peaks. Also, Tether (USDT), the number 1 stablecoin, lost $1.3 billion from its supply, while DAI lost $4.4 billion. At press time, the total market capitalization of all stablecoins stands at $132 billion, an over 20% decline. More so, stablecoins occupy 10.4% of the total crypto market cap, which has fallen by over 50% from its peak. The top 4 stablecoins account for nearly 90% billion of the overall stablecoin market cap, with USDT dominating the chart. Although BUSD and USDC’s decline affected the broader stablecoin market, the news brought more shine to USDT. As a result, USDT’s supply dominance has increased by over 60%. Moreover, the Tether printer appears to mint more this year, adding $15 billion to the stablecoin’s supply. That has pushed Tether’s supply to 81 billion USDT, nearly equaling its May 2022 all-time high of 83 billion USDT. Stablecoin Market Improves While Cryptocurrencies Turn Bearish Although BUSD and USDC’s supply shortage is significant, over the past month, other stablecoins increased supply. That includes the Pax Dollar (USDP), which saw a 40% increase in circulating supply since the start of April. The increased USDP minting pushed its circulating supply above 1 billion. Related Reading: Yield Curve Reaches Historic Low, What It Means For Bitcoin USDP isn’t the only stablecoin that witnessed an increase in circulating supply. Gemini Dollar (GUSD) also did, even though its supply is only a speck in the overall stablecoin market share. This stablecoin witnessed an over 12% increase in supply to $440,000 in the last month. Despite the total stablecoin market share falling from its previous peak, it recorded a slight increase of 0.06% in the last 24 hours. But the global cryptocurrency market cap has declined by 1.36% over the past 24 hours. The crypto market has met a correction over the past 48 hours after several weeks of a bullish uptrend. At press time, the two chief cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, are trading bearish. Meanwhile, most stablecoins are green today, with USDT, USDC, and BUSD trading at a 0.01% price increase over the past 24 hours.

42420772,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqmEv,1682010000,Web3 Security Startup Shield Raises $2.1M in Pre-Seed Funding,"Web3 security firm Shield said Thursday it raised $2.1 million in pre-seed funding to build an industry standard that keeps businesses and consumers safe from potential threats.  The funding round for the company, which is also member of crypto investment firm a16z’s Crypto Startup School, included participation from Kraken Ventures, Eterna Capital, Alchemy, MoonPay and Rob Behnke, CEO of crypto security firm Halborn.  Emmanuel Udotong, CEO and co-founder of Shield, told CoinDesk the company aims to build an industry standard for companies in the Web3 space to securely operate their businesses.  Shield starts with a certification program that helps businesses determine where their vulnerabilities lie and then recommends products to keep users safe. Currently, Shield offers an API that helps identify potential scams within a protocol, as well as a Discord bot that helps monitor community-based malicious activity.  Shield Chief Operating Officer and co-founder Isaiah Udotong told CoinDesk that much of the security necessary for Web3 stems from the same problems users faced in early days of the internet.  “In the early 2000s e-commerce scammers were stealing credit card details from people when they were entering credit cards to buy products online,” said Udotong. “That problem was solved with a secure sockets layer (SSL), and that's what we're doing in 2023 – we're building a scam-free layer for crypto.”  Luis Carchi, chief technology officer of Shield, told CoinDesk that Web3 security is multifaceted, and that it’s necessary for the company to implement multiple products to ensure Web3 businesses are protected.  “We aren't trying to be ‘the Chrome extension,’ or ‘the Discord bot,’” said Carchi. “We're actually thinking about this from a full-stack point of view, and we’re being as holistic as possible.”  Shield has already amassed over 350,000 users and has clients including entertainment company Fox Sports, non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace Rarible and token-gated infrastructure platform Guild.xyz.  Shield aims to use the funding to build out its engineering team, as well as devote resources to research and development as Web3 technology – and scammers – becomes more advanced.

42388977,2Ddqx6Q6poSnP0iSLOeRfP,1682009037,"Bitcoin's Move Below 20-DMA Possible Short-Term Bearish Signal, Analysts Say","Bitcoin lost ground for a second straight day on Thursday, dropping to a 10-day low of $28,300 as traders appeared to move away from risky assets.  After rallying since the start of the year, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value, bitcoin, appears to be losing ground. Bitcoin closed below the 20-day moving average (DMA) on Wednesday, according to data from TradingView, signaling a sign of weakness. The last time the cryptocurrency traded below the 20-DMA was in mid-March.  A 20-day moving average is a short-term view and could allow investors to trigger further selling pressure, according to Laurent Kssis, a crypto trading adviser at CEC Capital.  “The 20-day moving average has less lag [time it takes to signal a potential reversal] and tracks more closely bitcoin,” said Kssis. “In our view it shows a correction to the market which could accentuate.”  The drop comes a day after a large bitcoin sell order on crypto exchange Binance and an unexpectedly high U.K. March inflation figure of more than 10%.  “This pullback doesn’t look positive. However, when looking at bitcoin’s yearly chart, it's clear we have just witnessed a period of exceptional growth as the industry recovers from the crypto mishaps of the past few years,” said Sheraz Ahmed, managing partner at Storm Partners, in an interview with CoinDesk.  “We could be witnessing the beginnings of an overdue but overall healthy correction, which should encourage further accumulation,” added Ahmed.  In traditional markets, sentiment was knocked by a decline in Tesla (TSLA) shares, which dropped 8.5% on the day, following the company’s earnings report released Wednesday. It showed a more than 20% drop in net income compared with last year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 are currently down while the Nasdaq is flat.  Craig Erlam, an analyst at foreign-exchange trading firm Oanda, said in a Thursday note that despite bitcoin’s rally since the start of the year, the recovery may be running on fumes.

The U.S. crypto exchange received a Class F license from the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA), which allows the company to operate as a digital asset exchange in that territory.  The news comes two days after Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong indicated the U.S.-based exchange would consider out of the U.S. if clear crypto regulation isn't enacted. In March the exchange was reported to have been in discussions with institutional clients about setting up a crypto-trading platform overseas.  For now, it is not clear what services Coinbase will offer in Bermuda.  “While we are excited to partner with the BMA, and to have successfully attained the Class F License in this high-bar regulatory jurisdiction, nothing to announce today regarding our future plans to offer services through this license,” a spokesperson told CoinDesk.  As part of what the exchange calls its “8-week international expansion drive,” Coinbase in its blog post took note of, among other items, doubling down on its investments in the Canadian market.

42394056,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvVbCP,1682007954,Why the EU Has MiCA and the U.S. Has Securities Law Confusion,"The European Parliament went ahead and did it: Today, after years of deliberations and at least two official delays, the landmark Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework was voted in. European Union legislators also passed a separate crypto-related rule known as the Transfer of Funds regulation that imposes stronger surveillance and identification requirements for crypto operators, CoinDesk’s Jack Schickler reported.  The rules were described as a ""world first” by the European Commission's Mairead McGuinness, and also an “end of the Wild West era for crypto assets,"" according to Green Party lawmaker Ernest Urtasun. The laws, which will be enforced at the state-level, still need to be officially approved by the supra-governmental body called the EU Council, are just about cleared to take effect next year. (The Council’s approval is more of a formality at this point, considering it already approved the text of the law last year.)  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  For many, MiCA represents a crucial step forward for the crypto industry. It’s the first major attempt to provide a comprehensive set of rules for crypto companies so they know in advance what they can and cannot do and where their responsibilities lie if they want to operate in the 27-nation strong trading bloc. The European Union hopes it sets the global standard (and, in some sense, is worried about MiCA’s effectiveness in the EU if similar rules are not adopted everywhere).  CoinDesk has written a number of overviews of the legal framework. But. in short, MiCA requires crypto firms – like wallet providers and exchanges – to be licensed by the EU, and comply with money laundering and terrorism finance safeguards if they want to serve EU-based customers. Some have balked at the reporting standards, which will undoubtedly weaken privacy for crypto users in the name of customer safety and national security.  But considering how regulatory uncertainty has damped the crypto industry’s ability to grow over the past decade (that’s been a recurring line from crypto lobbyists and advocates), the move brings some amount of welcomed transparency and stability. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao tweeted his support, calling MiCA “a pragmatic solution” with which his exchange will comply.  All this is in comparison to the two other massive crypto markets – the U.S. and China. At least on paper, China has officially banned all crypto activity – but recent smoke signals suggest that freeze could thaw (at least in a Hong Kong financial sandbox). The country has not been able to stamp out crypto trading or mining entirely, and legitimizing some portions of the industry could be a boon for those looking to return.  Meanwhile, in the U.S. there seems to be a coordinated effort of elected representatives, unelected regulators and overpaid policymakers as well as the Federal Reserve and Biden administration to get crypto out of the wider economy. It seems to be part of what President Joe Biden called a “whole-of-government approach” to dealing with crypto in an executive order at the beginning of 2022, before the worst excesses and calamities of the year came to light.  There are still authorities in the U.S. working to legitimize and regulate crypto, even if some high-powered officials like Gary Gensler, chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), are opposed to writing new rules. According to Gensler, the financial rules already on the books are clear enough to cover the novel peculiarities of decentralized tech. Political infighting between those who want to give crypto time to find its legs and those who prefer knee-capping it has left the entire industry worse for wear.  Right now, ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap and the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, is in a situation similar to Schrödinger’s security – stuck in a superposition of being both lawful and not, essentially because Gensler has said ether may and may not have fallen afoul of the Howey Test definition of a security.  See also: SEC Lays Its Cards on the Table With Assertion That DeFi Falls Under Purview  Such legal insecurity has led the chief executive of Coinbase, the largest U.S. crypto exchange to say it may have to leave the country.You can say it’s an empty threat considering Coinbase’s business is built around extracting fees from U.S. customers, but Brian Armstrong is hardly alone.  In all fairness, Gensler is calling for common-sense oversight of increasingly powerful financial rails. Boil down what he wants – for exchanges to register with the SEC and bulk up their customer identification systems – and I’m sure it’s not too far off from the EU’s new standards. Of course, the difference between the EU and U.S. is that one took a “whole-of-government” approach to dealing with crypto, while the other merely says it will.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/04/20/why-the-eu-has-mica-and-the-us-has-securities-law-confusion,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a1ded92afdbe7105d6535dfe25771bf797114c7c-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Bitcoin 72-Hour MA Funding Rates Pattern That May Kick Off Uptrends As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the price has started rising recently whenever the metric has been near zero inside the negative zone. The “funding rate” is an indicator that measures the periodic fee that traders on the Bitcoin futures market are currently exchanging with each other. When the value of this metric is negative, it means the short contract holders are currently paying a premium to the long holders in order to hold onto their positions. Such a trend suggests that bearish sentiment is more dominant in the market right now. On the other hand, positive values of the indicator imply the longs are paying a fee to the shorts at the moment, and hence, the holders with a bullish mentality outweigh those with a bearish one. Related Reading: Traders Count Losses As Total Liquidations Approach $300 Million Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 72-hour moving average (MA) Bitcoin funding rate over the last few months: Looks like the 72-hour MA value of the metric has been positive in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As you can see in the above graph, the quant has marked the relevant portions of the trend for the 72-hour MA Bitcoin funding rates. It seems like there have been a few instances during the last few months where the indicator has just turned negative (that is, still near the zero mark) and the price of the cryptocurrency has followed up by catching some upwards momentum shortly after. While the left and right instances in the chart had the metric coming back inside the positive zone not too long after forming this pattern, the middle occurrence saw it go much deeper inside the negative territory first, and it was only after the initial leg up in the price that the funding rate became positive again. Based on this, it seems like a neutral to a negative value of the 72-hour MA Bitcoin funding has provided the proper ground for the price to rally during these last few months.

Despite this drawdown, however, the 72-hour Bitcoin funding rate is still significantly above the zero line, meaning that if the pattern that has apparently held during the last few months has to form again, more bearish positions would need to be opened on the market to nudge the balance towards the negative zone.

The New York-based bank’s parent company, Metropolitan Bank Holding (MBH), announced in January that it was terminating crypto-related services after recent developments in the industry and regulatory pressure. The decision came shortly after former-crypto exchange FTX collapsed. Its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, is facing multiple fraud charges.

42394070,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvVksV,1682003443,Is Europe’s MiCA a Template for Global Crypto Regulation?,"Today, the European Parliament approved the European Union’s crypto-assets framework, the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA).  It was a nonevent, in that the outcome of the vote was expected. Yet, it is momentous because it gets the EU’s 27 members closer to being the first in the world to having a comprehensive crypto law. With just a couple of final administrative steps outstanding, the enforcement clock will start ticking in June this year, giving 12 to 18 months for the rules to kick in.  Dea Markova is a managing director and head of digital assets at Forefront Advisers.  For the avoidance of doubt, the rules were agreed upon last summer. It took this long to clear the 571-page law through the EU’s legal and translation services. That’s all there was to the delay, despite conspiracy theories and rumours that something darker was afoot.  Legal and compliance teams should study the final text to make sure the details they captured last year when the text was agreed upon politically didn’t change under the scrutiny of the legal services – but changes will be marginal.  Is MiCA the best that the regulatory world has to offer?  The market is as positive as a market can be about regulation. Through booms and busts, U.S. enforcement frenzies, and layoffs, the centralized crypto market has fallen in love with MiCA. It offers a licence tailored to crypto-asset services and stablecoin issuers that is passport-able across 27 EU member states and 450 million people.  It deliberately refrains from regulating decentralized finance (DeFi) or non-fungible token (NFT) activities. It borrows from capital markets regulation – the 2014 Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) – but it does not copy it. For example, there are no suitability tests to divide between knowledgeable and nonknowledgeable crypto investors. Rules on stablecoins issuers will give consumers confidence that their tokens are properly reserved and always redeemable.  Read more: Anna Baydakova - MiCA at the Door: How European Crypto Firms Are Getting Ready for Sweeping Legislation  While banks, custodians and asset managers are currently weary of the reputational risk of dealing with crypto, MiCA stands to build institutional comfort with crypto as an asset-class.  MiCA is legislation written by competent technocrats who serendipitously timed the negotiations with the bull market and thus captured political interest and optimism that has since vanished in the EU.  In my opinion, MiCA is a politically acceptable and workable compromise, building on existing rules frameworks. It was important to get it done now that the market is mature enough and profitability pressures are testing governance and risk management. It gives entrepreneurs certainty and it stops policymakers from a knee-jerk reaction to an industry issue.  One key weakness  By choosing to rely on available regulatory frameworks, the Commission set MiCA to regulate token issuers as entities, not token exchanges as activities. That is, the requirements are on the issuer, regardless of how its token is used. This, I believe, limits how future-proof MiCA is.  Regulatory professionals will recognize these terms; they have a history. Over the past decade, the mantra for authorities from Europe to Asia has been to adapt to the unbundling of financial services by creating activity-based, not entity-based, regulation. For example, we now focus on the activity of buy-now-pay-later specifically, rather than just on banks as a type of entity.  Issuing tokens as bearer instruments makes this impossible – the issuer is not in charge, or not thus far in charge, of determining whether their token is used to pay or to invest.  Read more: Jack Schickler - High Hopes for EU’s MiCA Law With Final Vote Imminent  The EU squared this circle by focusing on probabilities. It said that a token pegged to a currency is more likely to be used for payments than anything else, so it should follow that regulatory framework. In EU language, this is an e-money token (EMT), a token that fluctuates freely is more like an investment, and is regulated as such.  A lot of political energy was spent on tokens pegged to a basket of currencies, commodities or other assets. This was Europe chasing the ghost of Facebook’s libra stablecoin experiment, while the market was busy moving on. The rules on these assets are complicated and opaque in their attempt to address both the payments and the investment use case.  This points to how crypto complicates the normal payment versus investment distinction. MiCA Level 2 technical rules will seek to draw a clearer line, but it will be difficult. There are 20 technical standards to be written for MiCA, and this may be one of the more complex ones.  Perhaps by setting its legal framework the EU can create the market behaviors anticipated in the legislation – i.e., what token is to be used for payments, and what is for investment.  Finally, while the market function of EMTs can be comparable to that of e-money, their technology is like other tokens. So far, the EU has been flip-flopping on technology neutrality. For anti-money laundering purposes, because of their underlying technology, EMTs are treated differently from e-money. But in June the Commission will suggest that EMTs should offer the same consumer protections as e-money, including reversible payments, despite their underlying technology.  Will MiCA become a global template?  For international companies, the key question is when and how the global crypto order will be established.  Regulators are asking themselves the same. For a market as digitally accessible as crypto, there are very few rules in Europe that can protect EU citizens from subpar services offered from abroad. This would be particularly true if a non-European exchange chooses to offer a hyped-up token (e.g., Terra's luna, which collapsed spectacularly last summer) and Europeans flock to it without solicitation.  The international framework is being established by the Financial Stability Board, and will have to be rolled out by the G-20 members. Because MiCA came first, the EU is very keen that the FSB aligns. Learning a lesson from the FTX scandal, the FSB might take a tougher stance on the commingling of activities and funds. In parallel, the U.K., now outside the EU, is setting its own stablecoin and crypto-asset services rules, similar to MiCA.  In short, Europe has a good chance to export MiCA, albeit with a time lag. But the combination of this time lag and the bear market may in the meantime expose companies to erratic regulators, and consumers to unstable businesses.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Dea Markova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/04/20/is-europes-mica-a-template-for-global-crypto-regulation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a9dc27f420c6c3044a073133e6c4a0b240172cb4-5200x3467.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Related Reading: Bitcoin Bearish Signal: Supply Older Than 7 Years On The Move However, the demand and accumulation remain low on the one-day chart, which is a concern. If bears push again, Polkadot could drop straight to its local support level. The broader market’s strength is crucial for Polkadot to regain its lost value. Unfortunately, with Bitcoin losing steam and falling below $30,000, most altcoins are also experiencing undecided price movements, which puts further pressure on Polkadot’s price recovery. At the time of writing, the market capitalization of DOT has fallen, indicating mounting short-term selling pressure Polkadot Price Analysis: One-Day Chart The Polkadot price is trending at $6.40, with overhead resistance at $6.60, a crucial level for the altcoin. This level has previously acted as a bearish block or a selling zone for the coin. If DOT manages to breach the $6.60 price level, it may face another resistance at $6.80 before finally reaching $7. However, if Polkadot fails to break past the overhead ceiling, the next support levels would be at $6 and then at $5.80, respectively. The amount of DOT traded in the last session was red, indicating a fall in demand for the coin. Overall, the Polkadot price movement depends heavily on its ability to break past the crucial resistance level at $6.60. Technical Analysis At present, the bears have not gained complete control over the Polkadot price. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates some optimism as it moves closer to the half-line, suggesting that sellers have not outnumbered buyers heavily. However, DOT is currently trading below the 20-Simple Moving Average line, indicating that sellers are driving the market momentum. Polkadot’s demand has been decreasing, leading to the formation of a sell signal on the one-day chart. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), which measures the price momentum and shift in trend, displayed red histograms associated with sell signals, further indicating a potential downward trend for DOT.

In addition, the Parabolic SAR, which measures the price direction and momentum, displayed dotted lines above the candlesticks. This meant that DOT was showing downward price action at the time of writing, indicating that the sellers are currently in control of the market.

But while its price has fallen by 3.12% within this period, the daily chart shows a slight recovery after LINK previously marked significant gains depicting intense momentum. The current value of LINK indicates that the token has seen some growth in its price since the start of 2023. On January 1, LINK was trading at a $5.57 price. By January 9, the token had already crossed the $6.0 level. Since then, it has been hovering below $9 and a little over the $5.9 price level. Some technical indicators may suggest LINK’s future price action. Chainlink (LINK) Plunged To New Support Level Chainlink has shown some positive price movements over the last week. However, its price action as of yesterday was not promising as the token fell below the $8 price mark. According to data from the 1-day chart, LINK created a long red bar. Related Reading: Bitcoin Korea Premium Index Shows Signs Of Selling, Pullback Soon? The bearish price movements brought its price to a new support level at $7.482144, which was formerly a resistance level until the recent breakout. The token started trading at $8.5755 yesterday but failed to make any significant progress, as its price continued to decline throughout the day. It eventually fell to the day’s closing price of $7.7704, a 9.39% decline throughout the period. LINK’s price decline can be attributed to the plunge of the broader crypto market on April 19. Major digital assets, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, dipped significantly throughout yesterday. Meanwhile, the market has made a slight recovery following yesterday’s downturn. Currently, LINK’s 24-hour trading volume is down by 26.64%, as it stands at $419,703,269, a notable difference from yesterday’s value of $543,475,883. At the time of writing, Chainlink trades at $7.891. Its price movements currently display a slight recovery from yesterday’s plunge, even though its 24-hour price change still shows a 3.12% decline. What’s Next For LINK? Chainlink is making a green bar after the huge red candle it made yesterday. The present price action indicates a recovery from its fall within the last 48 hours. Chainlink price is currently above the 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA), signaling more bullish sentiments than bearish. While the Relative Strength Index (RSI) still holds a neutral position at 54, there could be more buying pressure with time, given the current bullish sentiments of the market.

ZkSync Era, which launched in March 2023, uses zero-knowledge cryptography to allow people to transact on Ethereum with higher speeds and lower fees. Era exists within a fast-growing category of Ethereum scaling chains, called zkEVMs, which say they will be able to support any app that’s currently based on Ethereum.  By porting its protocol to zkSync Era, 1inch becomes one of the biggest-name crypto apps thus far to launch onto a zkEVM, or zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine.  ZkSync Era and its main competitor, Polygon zkEVM, are both still in beta mode but have recently been opened to developers.  1inch, which nabbed $175 million in a 2021 series B funding round, is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol best known for its exchange aggregator – a tool that allows crypto traders to find the best prices across different DEX platforms. DEXs are blockchain-based trading platforms that use smart contracts, rather than centralized middlemen, to allow people to swap between cryptocurrencies.  Along with its DEX aggregator, 1inch is also launching its limit order protocol onto zkSync Era.  Era is currently the leading zkEVM by total value locked. There is currently $250 million worth of cryptocurrency circulating in Era’s decentralized finance ecosystem according to L2beat, which tracks Ethereum’s layer 2 scaling chains. Polygon zkEVM has just $4 million, and other zkEVM-builders such as ConsenSys and Scroll have yet to launch on Ethereum’s main chain.  Era’s footprint in Ethereum’s wider layer 2 ecosystems continues to pale in comparison to Arbitrum and Optimism – “Optimistic rollup” networks that are less sophisticated than zkEVMs, but launched over a year earlier. They have attracted billions of dollars to their own networks for scaling Etheruem.  Decentralized finance “has been a driving force behind zkSync Era’s explosive growth,” Alex Gluchowski, CEO and co-founder of Matter Labs, said in a statement. “We expect the deployment of 1inch to contribute to even greater adoption and usage of zkSync Era.”  Ethereum’s core developers expect layer 2 scaling networks – Optimistic rollups and zkEVMs alike – to soon become the primary point of entry for most of Ethereum’s users.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | MATIC | ARB,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/04/20/1inch-aggregator-of-decentralized-crypto-exchanges-to-launch-on-ethereum-rollup-zksync-era,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/93ea0172c8543ad9b604cadca341b8f987399566-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The tables in Tableland are on-chain assets that can be grouped into models controlled by customizable authentication or permissions Developers can create tables, insert or query data, and grant the ability to contribute to their database.  ""Tableland integrates a battle-tested database into EVM-based smart contracts for the first time,"" said Tableland co-founder Andrew Hill in the press release. ""The ease and familiarity of SQL combined with a network of pre-built, composable data models will make it possible for developers to turn ideas into dapps faster than ever before.""  The models are distributed and stored on the Tableland Network, which has validators governed by the Tableland Protocol. The network is currently available in beta on Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum and Optimism.  The incentivized testnet is planned for the fourth quarter of this year with the production mainnet following in early 2024. Tableland Studios– a developer platform for designing and reusing relational database models – is preparing for an initial release for beta testers.

11952091,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=527779,1681998176,Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Momentum Screeches To A Halt: What’s The Outlook?,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) investors have been hit hard by the recent industry-wide crypto correction, with the token’s price momentum turning bearish. As the value of many cryptocurrencies took a dive, Shiba Inu followed suit, causing many to wonder what the next few weeks hold for this meme coin. Despite the negative trend, some traders remain hopeful that the demand zone could provide support and turn the tide. Related Reading: OKB Tallies 24% Increase But Active Addresses Fail To Keep Pace – Here’s Why On-Chain Data Signals Possible Downswing Amid the broader correction in the crypto market, Shiba Inu’s price has also taken a hit. According to CoinMarketCap, SHIB’s value is currently sitting at $0.00001091, with a 24-hour decrease of 0.62% and a 7-day decrease of 1.67%. The Shiba Inu ecosystem may face further downside as on-chain data reveals that SHIB holders are preparing to sell in the coming days. Data shows a significant decrease of 41% in Shiba Inu Network Growth since March 1, with new wallet addresses falling from 2,473 to 1,473 as of April 20. This reduction in network growth could indicate a loss of market share to other meme coins, and if the trend persists, SHIB’s price may struggle to find new buyers, leading to a potential price decline. Potential Price Movements For SHIB Based on data from IntoTheBlock’s Break-Even price distribution, Shiba Inu’s current support at $0.000011 is likely to be lost. However, the 38,000 addresses that bought 77 trillion SHIB coins in that zone may put up a strong resistance to the impending downward trend. If the bearish scenario materializes, the price of SHIB is expected to drop to $0.000009, where the 343,000 addresses holding 150 trillion SHIB may help to prevent further decline. On the other hand, if SHIB manages to overcome the bearish trend and break the $0.000012 resistance zone, it could continue its rally toward $0.000017. However, the 38,000 addresses holding 77 trillion tokens are likely to hinder the bullish momentum. Shiba Inu: More Bearish Signals On-chain data suggests that the cryptocurrency may be headed for a bearish trend. The 30-day Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, which measures holders’ short-term profit or loss, is nearing a potential sell-zone as most holders currently sit on 6.87% profits. This puts the MVRV ratio in a high-risk territory that could signal a potential price drop. SHIB market cap at $6.4 billion on the daily chart at TradingView.com Related Reading: Cardano Racks Up Nearly 4% Gain Amid Short-Term Losses – Will Investors Hold Firm? Adding to the bearish sentiment is the slowdown in new-user acquisition rate on the Shiba Inu Network, which raises concerns about the cryptocurrency’s market share in comparison to other meme coins. SHIB’s short-term outlook appears to be bearish, with potential downside risks looming in the near future. Investors should closely monitor the MVRV ratio and new-user acquisition rate for any further signs of a price drop. -Featured image from iHeartDogs",NEGATIVE,SHIB,ADA | BUSINESS | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/shiba-inue-price-falters/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

Through this arrangement users can use MoonPay as a payment service to directly buy and register their .eth domain instead of having to first buy ether (ETH) and set up a crypto wallet. Setting up a crypto wallet can be complicated to those that are not tech savvy, but using a fiat currency on-ramp overcomes such hurdles.  ENS is a domain name protocol that runs on the Ethereum blockchain. It provides users with an easily readable name such as “xyz.eth” instead of the long or complex alphanumeric address that is tied to a crypto wallet, making it easier for users to send and receive crypto to those shortened addresses. The service is similar to the Web2 version of the Domain Name System (DNS), which creates internet name addresses such as “google.com” for websites to substitute for their numeric internet protocol (IP) addresses.  “The goal of the integration is to offer a solution that eliminates this barrier by allowing users to use payment options that they are used to such as Apple Pay and Google Pay,” said Nick Johnson, the founder and lead developer at ENS. “By making it as user friendly as possible, this partnership will not only boost mainstream adoption of decentralized financial apps but also Web3 as a whole.”  Read more: What Is the Ethereum Name Service?

The fundraise, finalized in December, was led by Polychain Capital and included investors Hack VC, dao5, Tribe Capital, Shima Capital, CitizenX and Robot Ventures, as well as several undisclosed centralized crypto exchanges.  If it’s not obvious from the $420.69 million valuation, Berachain is a project that doesn’t shy away from crypto flair. It was launched by a quartet of pseudonymous founders (Smokey the Bera, Papa Bear, Homme Bera and Dev Bear) who are self-described crypto natives. Bera is bear intentionally misspelled, a sly hat tip to the deranged crypto rallying cry of Hodl.  Cosmos-based Berachain is, in essence, a rewind to the high-flying, is-this-a-Ponzi DeFi projects of 2021, before all the frauds, bankruptcies and Wells Notices sucked the degeneracy (and yields) out of crypto.  Berachain’s origins trace back to a non-fungible token (NFT) collection, Bong Bears, which three of the four pseudonymous co-founders launched in August 2021. The project’s OpenSea description reads: “100 absolutely zooted NFT bears getting baked.” But even the project’s name (and Smokey’s) is a misnomer. “I don’t think anyone on the core team even smokes,” said Berachain co-founder Smokey in an interview with CoinDesk.  At the time, the team was inspired by the rebasing protocol OlympusDAO, which was rapidly gaining traction in the crypto community. In the fall of 2021, OlympusDAO’s OHM token traded at a high of $1,300. (It has since fallen to about $10 per OHM.) Bong Bears followed in the footsteps of OlympusDAO, creating the first-ever collection of rebasing NFTs, which spawned several new collections – Bond Bears, Boo Bears, Baby Bears, Band Bears and Bit Bears.  Read More: Olympus DAO Might Be the Future of Money (or It Might Be a Ponzi)  Smokey says the pivot from Bong Bears NFTs to launching a fully-fledged layer-1 blockchain is not so far-fetched. “Bong Bears bootstrapped a community of DeFi enthusiasts,” he said. “What if we could take some of the liquidity and make it useful?”  Proof of liquidity  Berachain says its technology will allow staked assets to be used in DeFi protocols, creating more liquidity and capital efficiency on-chain. Currently, staked assets, such as staked ether (ETH), are locked while they are used to secure the underlying blockchain’s network. Berachain says its ""proof of liquidity"" consensus will allow users to simultaneously stake assets on Berachain and use those assets to trade, borrow or lend on-chain.  According to a press release, the Bera ecosystem already has over $250 million in committed capital to deploy, and will launch a public incentivized testnet in the coming weeks.  “In a lot of cases, liquidity is mercenary,” said Smokey. “The reason why they’re mercenary is that you can’t do much with stake assets, they just sit there.”  “Berachain … provides the first structure which aligns incentives between liquidity and security at the chain level, creating a massive opportunity to absorb the majority of liquidity and turn it into a sticky, capital efficient base for DeFi platforms to build on top of,” said Polychain founder Olaf Carlson-Wee in a statement.  Berachain will also launch BERA, its native gas token, and BGT, its governance token. The ecosystem will also include a stablecoin, HONEY.  “If people want to think that we’re a rug, I would tell them to do their own research,” said Smokey. “There’s a nontrivial history of pseudonymous projects doing good things.”  UPDATE (April 20, 17:12 UTC): Adds name of additional investor.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | SPONSORED | TRADING,Tracy Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/04/20/defi-focused-layer-1-berachain-raises-42m-series-a-at-42069m-valuation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/613d45cf32201db63a9f310255d6c4372b0f80ae-2560x1410.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The release comes after Bancor’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) issued a proposal of the deployment on Ethereum, with 100% of the votes in favor of launching. Bancor uses an automated market maker (AMM) smart contract, a mechanism designed to provide liquidity to markets,  Carbon’s aim is to make trading on DEX easier and more advanced through trading functionality of a centralized exchange (CEX) but with the access and transparency of AMMs, according to the press release.  Read more: What Is a DEX? How Decentralized Crypto Exchanges Work  Carbon will create a single concentrated liquidity position that buys and sells only in specific price ranges, according to the press release. “Buy and sell ranges can be placed above and below a set price based on where a user expects a given token will trade, automating the process of swing trading on any ERC-20 token,” the press release said.  Liquidity pools typically require users to provide liquidity in a continuous range of prices, whereas Carbon is offering users the ability to distinguish between buy range and sell range, according to Nate Hindman, Bancor’s head of growth.  Customers will be able to “use a single liquidity position to set a buy range [e.g., buy $2,000-$2,100 worth of ETH] and a separate sell range [sell ETH between $2,300-$2,400],” Hindman told CoinDesk.  This will enable users to buy the token low and sell it high as ETH moves between those ranges. The liquidity automatically rotates between users’ ranges to fill the orders. This is a similar model seen on centralized exchanges, but has lacked on DEXs, said Hindman. “Bringing the trading functionality of CEXs to DEXs is key to driving the next wave of traders on-chain,” he added.

42394057,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvVjnp,1681994700,History Repeats: Applying What We Know About Tech Stocks to a New Market,"You know how people always say history repeats itself? Lately, I’ve been looking back on my years as an advisor in the 1990s and realizing just how true that statement is.  This rush of interest in blockchain and cryptocurrency investing feels a lot like the early demand for technology stocks. Remember when the Internet was still new, during the time of the Dot Com Bubble and the advent of companies like Amazon? Investors saw the developing value of tech, and, as the pattern goes, stock prices soared based on the promise of vast wealth creation and disruption.  However, as we learned in the subsequent “tech wreck” of the early 2000s, sometimes expectations have nothing to do with reality. Many investors lost everything and far more than they made in the previous bull market. This is typical of a bubble. Most investors enter at or near the high only to watch their wealth disappear in the ensuing correction.  You're reading Crypto for Advisors, a weekly look at digital assets and the future of finance for financial advisors. Subscribe here to receive the mailing every Thursday.  When we invest, we need to separate the hype of revolutionary technology from the actual prospects for commercialization. This is really hard to do, especially for the average investor, as well as incredibly difficult for the financial advisor who is trained to counsel prudence and caution while insanity rages on everywhere around them.  In the ’90s, many advisors’ clients wanted all-in on tech stocks. Clients were losing faith in their advisors because diversification flat-out did not work. During the bubble period, the NASDAQ Composite index, which is heavily weighted towards technology stocks, rose from around 1,000 in 1995 to a peak of 5,048.62 on March 10, 2000. This represented an increase of more than 400% in just five years. During that same time, the S&P 500 also performed very well, rising over 200%, but that wasn’t good enough when the Nasdaq was up almost double.  Read more: Price, Not Intrinsic Value, Is the True Measure of Bitcoin’s Success  Imagine telling your client for five straight years that the tech stock bubble was just a “fad” that would soon pass. Even the best, most trusted advisors had difficulty convincing clients to avoid the “shiny object” and stay the course with a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds. Unfortunately, many clients lost faith entirely and took matters into their own hands, becoming either day traders or investing all of their money in the famous Janus Twenty fund, which at its peak grew to a whopping 88 billion dollars. Notably, this fund invested in just twenty stocks, with their top holdings in companies like AOL, Cisco, and Qualcomm. By the end of 2002, this fund’s assets under management had fallen to around $12 billion.  Give them what they want…but not so much of it  As an advisor, I chose a different approach. Rather than alienating the client by telling them what not to do, I was far more interested in building a collaborative process. If they wanted to sell everything and put it all in Qualcomm, my response was, “Yes, Qualcomm has really performed lately; perhaps we should create a small allocation to Qualcomm and some other telecom stocks. What other stocks are you considering for this more aggressive part of your portfolio?” The clients felt heard, and I was able to protect them from their own worst enemy, which was greed.  Some of you may be feeling the same burn with digital assets. Like tech, blockchain has real, tangible, long-term use cases. Unfortunately, the pattern for consumer adoption of new innovation is to take it to extremes, and this was very apparent with crypto. Terra Luna, Three Arrows Capital, Blockfi, Celsius, FTX, and many others are all good examples of this. Not only were clients investing in crypto, but they were also playing around with leverage!!! It only makes sense that you’re factoring this into your investment strategy by generally telling clients to stay away from or avoid this speculative asset class.  However, telling the client to “go it alone” is not the answer—and if they’re interested, they will go it alone. As we saw after the inevitable industry shake-up, a number of investors were heavily invested in specific exchanges or tokens, often without guidance from financial professionals or diversification. With all of their eggs in one basket, they took massive losses. I would argue that many of these clients would have worked with their financial advisor if their advisor had simply offered a more open and welcoming approach toward digital assets.  The thing that I learned through tech stocks and that I can now impart to you is that taking a conservative stance toward investing in a new asset class makes sense, but it doesn’t have to be binary. There is a way to exercise caution while still giving your clients exposure. Just like the tech bubble and the subsequent crash in the early 2000s, small doses of the speculative asset class help satisfy the client’s urge to go “all in” while protecting them from the inevitable upheaval that comes with major innovation. This gives you the future chance to look back and say that you gave your investors a chance to embrace opportunity and the excitement of change while still maintaining a balanced, rational investment strategy.  The fact that blockchain technology is stirring up the market is a sign that it’s working. Like the Internet, it’s disruptive by nature, making the highs and lows we’ve weathered over the last year symptoms of positive change. We’re in the early phases of blockchain tech today, but we’re rapidly approaching broader innovation, with cryptocurrencies making way for the tokenization of real-world assets that are spurring revolutionary changes in the distribution of investment opportunities. Before you know it, there will be innumerable ways to invest in digital assets on behalf of your clients because blockchain will be a part of everything. Just as various businesses now leverage tech, blockchain has the potential to permeate across and benefit a wide swath of industries.  All of that is to say: it makes sense that investors want in on digital assets, and with your guidance, you can enable them to engage the market behind tomorrow’s exciting possibilities thoughtfully and, more importantly, securely.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Eric Ervin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/04/20/advisors-heres-what-the-dot-com-bubble-can-teach-us-about-crypto-investing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3389ac8b4d856507fcdbcf4638902c6cbe277108-1947x1095.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
11951012,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=527744,1681994570,Buy The Bitcoin And Crypto Dip Or Wait? Market Update,"With yesterday’s slump in Bitcoin and crypto markets, the uncertainty returns. Bitcoin, as the lead currency of the crypto market, is currently struggling to regain support at $29,100. At press time, Bitcoin has not yet been able to initialize an uptrend. BTC was trading at $28,680, down -5.5% since the price was rejected at the $30,500 level on Tuesday. The majority of altcoins are following this trend, writing even bigger losses for the most part. Buy The Bitcoin And Crypto Dip? The co-founders of on-chain data provider Glassnode, Jan Happel and Yann Allemann write in their latest market update “don’t get spooked” and explain that a $900+ move in Bitcoin is in line with expectations, “avoid shake outs”. According to the analysts, the market sentiment remains intact. Both the fear and greed index and the on-chain data (NUPL) continue to look bullish. Bitcoin’s average true range is between $28,300 and $30,200, according to Glassnode founders. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bearish Signal: Supply Older Than 7 Years On The Move Sentiment has not turned negative either. The fear and greed index continues to signal greed in the market, which should be considered bullish. Furthermore, the two analysts remark: Today’s retrace to the lower end of $29k is a good opportunity to buy. Our mid-term outlook remains bullish, order books show more liquidity, and the Bitcoin Risk Signal is at 0. Net Unrealized Profit and Loss (NUPL), the difference between market cap and realized cap divided by market cap, indicates that unrealized gains exceed unrealized losses, which is also bullish. Analyst Scott Melker thinks it remains to be seen whether this correction will continue. Nevertheless, he is confident that Bitcoin has found some support at the “most predictable level” at $28,600: I have been screaming this number from the mountaintop, so there should be no surprise here. This is theoretically strong support. If it breaks, we look to $25,212. Play it level by level. The renowned trader @52kskew, referring to the 4-hour chart of Bitcoin, notes that there is a retest of the previous resistance. In his opinion, a weak RSI divergence and the stochastic RSI signal that there will be a relief bounce. Related Reading: Yield Curve Reaches Historic Low, What It Means For Bitcoin A bullish scenario, according to him, would be a reclaim of $29,500 and the 4-hour/ 1-day trendline. The bearish scenario is a rejection at $29,500 and the 1-day EMA trend, as well as a trend towards $27,000. Regarding the lower timeframe aggregate CVDs and delta of Bitcoin, he notes, “Price moving higher here; while CVDs moving lower = limit buying & some absorption of sellers below $28.6K. Market buying yet to follow (which is the market momentum required for higher prices).” The Binance Open interest could also be an indicator that BTC will see a relief bounce: Some high short float here & funding moving lower. Ideally for a relief bounce there’s continued spot buying & funding goes negative later. At press time, the Bitcoin price stood at $28,680, bouncing up from another leg down.

42387660,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQn9vd,1681993862,First Mover Americas: Landmark Crypto Laws Pass in Europe,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Lawmakers in the European Union on Thursday voted 517-38 in favor of a new crypto licensing regime, Markets in Crypto Assets, which ispopularly known as MiCA, with 18 abstentions, making the EU the first major jurisdiction in the world to introduce a comprehensive crypto law. The European Parliament also voted 529-29 in favor of a separate law known as the Transfer of Funds regulation, which requires crypto operators to identify their customers in a bid to halt money laundering, with 14 abstentions. The votes follow a Wednesday debate in which lawmakers largely supported plans to make crypto wallet providers and exchanges seek a license to operate across the bloc of 27 nations and require stablecoin issuers to maintain sufficient reserves.  Bitcoin fell for a second straight day on Thursday, dropping to $28,500, a 10-day low. The world’s largest cryptocurrency declined 2% over the past 24 hours as traders across the globe moved away from risky assets. Bitcoin closed below its 20-day moving average on Wednesday, according to data from TradingView, a sign of weakness. The cryptocurrency has rallied this year, but Craig Erlam, an analyst at foreign-exchange trading firm Oanda, said in a morning note that the recovery may be running on fumes. Popular meme token, dogecoin (DOGE), was one of the few coins trading in the green Thursday, up 5% over the past 24 hours. Some supporters refer to April 20 as ""DogeDay.""  The substantive parts of the Voyager Digital-Binance.US sale deal could be allowed to proceed even before a legal appeal is worked through, court filings made Wednesday suggest, as concerns rise that the buyer could pull out. The document says the U.S. government has now agreed that the bulk of Binance.US' $1 billion deal to purchase assets of the bankrupt crypto lender can proceed, despite concerns that the fine print of the contract would pardon breaches of tax or securities law. The filing proposes that, until an appeal is settled, those contentious “exculpation provisions” should remain on hold, but not the remaining elements of the deal.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the on-chain movement of bitcoin that's been sitting dormant for between seven and 10 years.  More than 5,000 bitcoins, worth $144 million, were moved early Thursday.  Whenever such old coins move, bitcoin tends to see increased price turbulence.

42394061,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvVkDT,1681990200,Imagining the Future AI and Web3 Can Build,"Imagine a world where your artificial intelligence (AI) assistant could manage your finances, schedule appointments and tailor your social media feed to show content that won’t aggravate you. This AI might be trained to also curate your non-fungible token (NFT) art collection and help you file your crypto taxes.  It may sound like science fiction, but AI, Web3 and the metaverse are rapidly converging to make this digital utopia a reality.  Sandy Carter is chief operating officer and head of business development at Unstoppable Domains, a platform for user-owned digital identity.  If the researchers from Dartmouth College, who first coined the term ""artificial intelligence"" in 1956, could glimpse the present day they would be astounded by the leaps and bounds the industry has made. In 2022, AI and Web3 technologies emerged as formidable forces, with innovations including OpenAI's DALL-E and ChatGPT practically passing the so-called Turing test, meant to measure when a computer can pass as human.  While AI has gained mainstream traction (with tech giants including Microsoft, Google and Adobe joining the fray), Web3 has further to go. Bitcoin has been minting blocks for 13 years, but most still are unsure what crypto is for.  However, with the emergence of AI's creative potential, the need for and abilities of Web3 have never been clearer. Cryptographic security and digital sovereignty are increasingly essential as AI is rolled out to forge a more vibrant, empowering digital landscape and pave the way for an innovative, user-centric and secure internet experience.  A techno symbiosis  With a few prompts, anyone can use AI tools to create images, text or code, saving time and making content production faster and easier. At the same time, Web3 technologies such as blockchain, smart contracts and digital IDs are building the groundwork for a secure, interoperable metaverse that reclaims user data control.  Regaining control over personal data in an age of data breaches and privacy concerns cannot be overstated. Web3 can help in fostering trust and autonomy in the digital realm. Digital IDs, in particular, provide individuals with a unified, user-controlled internet identity. They’re likely essential to creating long-standing, verified personal reputation systems in the real world and the metaverse.  This shift toward decentralization and digitization empowers people and businesses to ultimately wrest control from the clutches of Big Tech monopolies. Despite concerns about both crypto and AI, they also hold vast potential to free people up to create (and reap what they sow).  A seamless digital collaboration  Consider the process of generating art for metaverse platforms. AI can produce basic elements such as mountains, castles or forests while human artists add the finishing touches that breathe life into the scene. This collaboration can extend to nearly every industry – from content moderation to business management. The use of automatized smart contracts can help ensure humans still receive fair credit and compensation for the work they do.  Moreover, AI assistants like ChatGPT, already adept at processing natural language, could be expanded to build people’s online reputations. AI tools will soon be able to curate unique NFT art collections tied to a user's digital ID, which reflect someone’s personal or professional achievements – like a comprehensive LinkedIn page that follows users everywhere online. Unstoppable Domains, for instance, has already integrated ChatGPT into its search bar, offering an AI partner to help shoppers brainstorm creative Web3 domain ideas.  While the full range of innovations driven by AI, Web3 and the metaverse remains uncertain, the potential is undeniably vast. By designing technologies that enhance human experiences, we can build an internet that resembles our wildest sci-fi fantasies. These revolutions are just around the corner, and it is up to developers and technology leaders to shape their futures.  A brighter future  New tech is being deployed that has the potential to box fix lingering issues with existing technologies and also deepen the issues that come with economic and social disruption like data privacy, equitable access to services and potential job displacement. Open dialogue and collaboration among technologists, policymakers and society at large will be essential in overcoming these challenges.  Read more: Web2’s Lesson for AI: Decentralize to Protect Humanity / Opinion  On the brink of massive digital transformation, the synergistic relationship between AI, Web3 and the metaverse offers a wealth of opportunities to reinvent how everyone experiences the internet. By championing collaboration, nurturing human creativity and proactively addressing potential challenges, we can establish a dynamic, decentralized digital realm that empowers individuals and unleashes the boundless potential of human innovation.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY,Sandy  Carter,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/04/20/imagining-the-future-ai-and-web3-can-build,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f854648d8d979b449199a3805c07be48c5c3fe33-2400x1440.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

11949686,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=527720,1681989027,Bitcoin Bearish Signal: Supply Older Than 7 Years On The Move,"On-chain data shows a large amount of Bitcoin supply dormant for more than 7 years ago has moved recently, a sign that may be bearish for the price. Bitcoin Supply Aged Between 7 And 10 Years Old Has Been Transferred Recently As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the movement of such an old supply has generally led to a drop in the price of the cryptocurrency in the past. The relevant indicator here is the “Spent Output Age Bands” (SOAB), which tracks the number of coins that each age band in the Bitcoin market is moving currently. The “age bands” here refer to groups of coins divided based on how much time they have been sitting dormant inside a single wallet address. For example, the 1-day to 1-week band includes all tokens that haven’t been transferred on the blockchain since between one day and one week ago. The SOAB for this specific cohort would measure the total amount of coins belonging to this age range that are being moved by their investors on the blockchain right now. Related Reading: Bitcoin Korea Premium Index Shows Signs Of Selling, Pullback Soon? In the context of the topic at hand, the age band of interest is the 7-10 years cohort. Here is a chart that shows the trend in the SOAB for this particular group over the last few years: Looks like the value of the metric has been quite high in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As shown in the above graph, the Bitcoin SOAB for the 7-10 years age band has shown an extraordinarily large spike recently. This means that a large number of these super dormant coins have just been transferred between wallets. Generally, when holders with such aged supply show some movement, it’s a possible sign that they are selling their coins. Naturally, this could have bearish implications for the asset’s value. In the chart, the quant has highlighted the points where the 7-10 years Bitcoin age band has shown spikes of similar or larger scale during the last few years. Related Reading: Bitcoin Shrimp Supply Continues To Rise, Why This Is Good It seems like the cryptocurrency has usually observed the formation of local tops whenever the indicator has displayed such a spike in its value. The reason behind these highs looks to be at least in part the selling pressure put on the market by these investors. Holders with such old coins are the most resolute bunch in the Bitcoin market, so they usually only sell in the most extreme circumstances. As these diamond hands may have sold recently, it can be a sign of wider mentality problems among investors. If the historical instances of this trend are anything to go by, BTC may observe some drawdown from this selling soon. The analyst also notes, however, that the last occurrence of this trend, which was back in November 2022, didn’t cause any noticeable effects on the price. This implies that there is a possibility that the current spike in the SOAB of this group may follow the lead of this previous instance instead, which if indeed so, would mean that Bitcoin doesn’t feel a bearish effect from this after all. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $28,800, up 5% in the last week.

The decision from a court in the city of 's-Hertogenbosch follows Pertsev's arrest in August on the orders of Dutch financial crime authority FIOD.  “We are ecstatic that he can be set free,” Pertsev’s lawyer Keith Cheng told CoinDesk, adding that Pertsev will “now work even harder and better on his defense,” which raises “important issues about privacy on Ethereum.”  Pertsev will be released next Wednesday, allowing time for the installation of electronic monitoring devices at his home. He will have to wear an ankle bracelet, but won't have to pay any financial security.  Shortly before Pertsev’s arrest, Tornado Cash was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, which said the service had been used to raise funds for the North Korean regime.  The Dutch public prosecutor had previously argued Pertsev posed a flight risk and could hide evidence if he were to be released, but until this week had made only generic accusations.  This week, the public prosecutor issued more specific charges that Pertsev habitually laundered over 500,000 ether (ETH), which he should have suspected was of criminal origin. Pertsev has denied those charges.  Another investigation hearing will be held on May 24, and the court will also explore the issue of Pertsev’s residence status, which may expire in July.

XRD has rallied by 176% to 11.4 cents, with the price reaching a 12-month high of 15 cents at one point, Messari data shows. The rally has lifted the cryptocurrency's market capitalization to $1.16 billion, making it the 46th-largest coin in the market. In four weeks, market leaders bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) have gained 2.6% and 8.2%, respectively, while the total crypto market capitalization has increased 5% to $1.18 trillion.  Radix's March fundraising, led by market maker and investment firm DWF Labs, and optimism about an impending upgrade seem to have galvanized investors' interest in the token, according to Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at Matrixport. The financing round gave Radix a valuation of $400 million.  ""Radix raised $10m in funding ahead of the launch of its Babylon mainnet scheduled for July 31, which will introduce smart-contract functionality on the network,"" Thielen said in an email.  XRD rallied over 15% on March 23, when the fundraising was announced, and began a near-vertical rise a week later after Radix rolled out the ""Release Candidate"" network, or RCNet, bringing a highly anticipated upgrade a step closer.  The upgrade, called ""Babylon,"" will introduce smart-contract capabilities to Radix, allowing developers to create powerful decentralized applications. As of last month, Radix had more than 50 projects developing applications and tools for gaming, trading, lending, non-fungible tokens and wallets.  Babylon will natively support liquid staking of XRD, eliminating the need for separate protocols like Lido, which help ether stakers retain the liquidity of their coins by issuing staked ether tokens. Staking refers to locking coins in the blockchain to boost network security in return for rewards.  ""The Radix Public Network upgrade from Olympia to Babylon will occur on or about July 31st, 2023, paving the way for global Web3 and DeFi to finally exit the 'tech demo' stage with a mainstream-capable user and developer experience,"" Radix said in an official announcement.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/04/20/radixs-xrd-token-beats-wider-crypto-market-with-176-surge-in-a-month,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/759358440bf87830887f5aaf0998e805ea52f424-2601x1120.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The vote follows a Wednesday debate in which lawmakers largely supported plans to make crypto wallet providers and exchanges seek a license to operate across the bloc, and require issuers of stablecoins tied to the value of other assets to maintain sufficient reserves.  In a tweet, the European Commission's Mairead McGuinness described the vote as a ""world first"" for crypto rules.  ""We’re protecting consumers and safeguarding financial stability and market integrity,"" McGuinness said. ""The rules will start applying from next year.""  In a statement released by the European Parliament, Stefan Berger, the lawmaker who led negotiations on the law, said the rules put the EU ""at the forefront of the token economy.""  ""The European crypto-asset industry has regulatory clarity that does not exist in countries like the U.S.,"" Berger said. ""The sector that was damaged by the FTX collapse can regain trust.""  The European Securities and Markets Authority also welcomed the vote in a tweet, and said it will ""announce in due time"" its timetable for drafting secondary legislation under MiCA. ""ESMA still warns consumers that investing in cryptoassets is a risky endeavour with limited safeguards at this stage,"" the EU agency added.  The Markets in Crypto Assets regulation was first proposed by the European Commission in 2020, and to pass into law has to be approved by the parliament and the EU’s Council, which represents the bloc’s member states.

Despite a recent 3.60% slump in prices within the past 24 hours, ADA has still managed to sustain a seven-day rally of 4%, according to CoinMarketCap at the time of writing. Currently priced at $0.4205, the cryptocurrency’s overall upward trend has left investors wondering whether this brief dip in value is merely a momentary setback or a sign of more substantial declines to come. Related Reading: OKB Tallies 24% Increase But Active Addresses Fail To Keep Pace – Here’s Why Support Zone Signals Positive Outlook For ADA Despite Correction Although ADA experienced a correction, there is a glimmer of hope for the cryptocurrency as it managed to find solid support near the $0.41 per token zone. This suggests that there are significant buyers who are willing to take the risk and invest in the token at these levels with an eye on future growth. Looking ahead, the price movement of the crypto is largely subject to market trends, given the absence of any specific fundamental triggers. However, if the recent correction was a means to weed out the most speculative investors and latecomers, and the market resumes its upward trajectory, then ADA is poised for continued success. Cardano Shows Strong Bullish Prospects Despite Mixed Indicators The coin has formed a range between $0.24 to $0.42, with the mid-point at $0.33 acting as a significant support and resistance level since October 2022. In the past two weeks, the RSI rose above 70, and although the OBV experienced a slight pullback after a large upward spike, it still showed strong demand and bullish sentiment behind ADA. Despite mixed indicators, Cardano’s ADA continues to show promising bullish prospects, with the RSI still above the neutral 50 level, and prices maintaining an upward trend.

While strong bullish sentiment may suggest future price increases, sudden fluctuations in market conditions can always occur. The recent indicators suggest that intense selling pressure has not yet affected the crypto, which can be seen as a positive sign for the bulls. The development activity for ADA has continued unabated, which can reassure long-term buyers about the potential for future growth.

The document says the U.S. government has now agreed that the bulk of Binance.US' $1 billion deal to purchase assets of the bankrupt crypto lender can proceed, despite concerns the fine print of the contract would pardon breaches of tax or securities law.  The April 19 filing proposes that until an appeal is settled those contentious “exculpation provisions” should remain on hold, but not the remaining elements of the deal.  “The plan and confirmation order contemplate certain transactions and other steps, including making certain distributions to Debtors’ account holders … the parties agree that these transactions may go forward while this appeal is litigated and resolved,” said the document, which is signed by a U.S. Attorney and U.S. Trustee – a Department of Justice official concerned with bankruptcy matters – as well as by lawyers for Voyager and its creditors, but has not yet been agreed by Judge Jennifer Rearden.  Binance.US’ proposal to purchase Voyager assets, originally made in December, was in March approved by Bankruptcy Judge Michael Wiles after a poll of Voyager creditors suggested massive support.

Read This Before Buying,"Although the meme coin PEPE was launched only four days ago, on April 16, it has been one of the hottest topics on the crypto markets in recent days. And not without reason. Since the launch, the PEPE price has skyrocketed by more than 20,000%. The creators of PEPE call the token itself “the most memeable meme coin in existence” and entitle Dogecoin, Shiba Inu and FLOKI as direct competitors. One of the meme coin’s taglines is “the dog days are over.” According to CoinMarketCap, PEPE’s fully diluted market cap has grown to nearly $131,5 million as of today, ranking the meme coin #2604 by market cap. For comparison, the meme coin FLOKI is ranked #111 and has a fully diluted market cap of $664.8 million, meaning that PEPE needs to 5x to reach the same size as the dog coin. Related Reading: Shiba Inu: How The Meme Coin Weathered Whale Dumping And Emerged Stronger At the time of writing, there were 28,647 holding addresses, whereas the number was already at 7,085 on the first day. Top 10 holders currently own 16.71%, top 20 holders 23.01%, top 50 holders 35.64% and top 100 holders 44.15% of all tokens. The trading volume has also surged massively in the last 24 hours and stands at $179.7 million. One story caused a particular stir in recent days. As reported by on-chain data provider Lookonchain, a smart money investor spent just 0.125 ETH, about $251, to buy 5.9 trillion PEPE four days ago, worth $1.14 million now. The SmartMoney is the luckiest guy I've seen recently. He spent 0.125 $ETH ($251) to buy 5.9T $PEPE ($1.14M currently) 4 days ago. If he sells at the current price of $0.0000001933, he will get a profit of ~$1.14M, more than 4,500x.https://t.co/cUqMO6zIVO pic.twitter.com/Ex5voyRvsa — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) April 19, 2023 Potential PEPE Buyers Need To Know This However, potential PEPE investors should be cautious. As 0xScope explained via Twitter, more than 20 addresses spent an amount of about 0.02 ETH on Fixed Float and Changenow to buy the new meme coin within five minutes of the token’s trading launch. Now these PEPE are worth between $0.8 to $1.1 million. Together they control 11.9% of the supply and are worth a total of $14 million. It has not yet been conclusively determined whether these are insiders. However, analysts warn that potential buyers should watch these addresses to avoid risk. Related Reading: These Top 5 Meme Coins Are Bleeding As March 2023 Ends – Here’s Why A more in-depth “tokenomics” analysis has been published by Arcanum Ventures. In terms of utility, the company notes that there are zero taxes, 93% goes to liquidity, 7% is held by the team for future CEX listings, LP tokens are burned. The token supply is 420,690,000,000, 100% is in circulation. The benefits for holders are the classic meme coin perks: “meme, vibe & HODL, and generational wealth,” according to Arcanum Ventures. “High-level overview of the roadmap reminds us of South Park,” the company adds. In terms of potential insiders, Arcanum also issues a warning: In the first three hours, there were more than 170 purchase transactions from decentralized exchanges, each purchase was about 0.50% of the total supply, all were unique wallet addresses – 70% of which had no transaction history, Arcanum analyzed. Looks like these UNDOXXED wallets scooped up 40% of the tokens after listing. Even more alarming, half of them proceeded to dump against retail buys. This looks like a hype #memecoin project. With suspicious on-chain activity. And very few promises. Do you think they’ll take PEPE meme mainstream? At press time, the PEPE price stood at $0.00000033785.

Agility is one liquid staking platform that has experienced tremendous growth in recent weeks. It calls itself a liquid staking derivatives (LSD) distribution platform that incentivizes deposits of ether and liquid staking tokens, according to its documents.  Agility’s contracts were launched in the past two weeks. Agility’s ETH staking pool contract, which holds almost $170 million worth of wrapped ether (wETH), had its first transaction nine days ago, while its deployer contract had its first transaction 14 days ago.  Five of the top 10 hottest decentralized finance (DeFi) smart contracts by total inflow value launched in the past 14 days belong to Agility, and almost $400 million has flowed into Agility’s staking pools in the past seven days, according to blockchain analytics firm Nansen.  “A large number of commentators are predicting a season of ""LSDeFi"" – products and services built around staked ETH yield,” said Nansen content lead Andrew Thurman. ""Agility appears to be one of the first successful examples, and the speed with which it has grown could be a sign there's more to come.”  Since April 12, Agility’s total value locked increased more than 643% to $467 million, per DefiLlama, while its AGI token has jumped roughly 185% to 53 cents, making its market capitalization stand at $7.5 million, according to CoinMarketCap.  On April 12, data from CoinGecko showed that AGI’s total daily trading volume stood at less than $9,000. Two days later, trading volume spiked to roughly $1.5 million. At presstime, AGI’s 24 hour trading volume has jumped to over $9.5 million.  According to Snapshot, the Agility decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) has 129 members. Nansen data shows that the number of unique addresses holding AGI has risen over to 926 at press time from one on April 5.  Despite performing well in terms of TVL and activity, Agility has raised the eyebrows of some after security detection platform GoPlus noted two “attention items” related to the code for the AGI token.  According to Open Zeppelin, three functions inside the AGI’s contract allows privileged accounts to mint more AGI, increasing the token’s supply and to pause the activity in the smart contract such as trading.  As a result, the AGI token page on CoinGecko says, “The smart-contract owner can mint new tokens, please proceed with caution.” CoinMarketCap on its AGI token page also expresses a similar cautionary warning.  Ismael Bautista, a software developer and community grants committee member for the Moonbeam Network, told CoinDesk over Discord that “the AGI token is a very standard OpenZeppelin implementation.”",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TRADING | BEAM | FORKS,Sage D.

11942939,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=527701,1681964423,Bitcoin Traders Count Losses As Total Liquidations Approach $300 Million,"Bitcoin (BTC) traders have experienced a tough week as the cryptocurrency dipped below $30,000, causing panic among traders who shorted Bitcoin in the hope of the asset’s price moving upwards. According to data provider Coinglass, many traders are counting their losses, and a record of approximately 87,977 traders have liquidated over the past 24 hours, totaling $291 million and counting. Total Liquidations Approach $300 Million Binance recorded the largest amount of liquidations, at $49.9 million, among all the tracked crypto exchanges involved in the liquidations. Other crypto exchanges in the market had a smaller trader volume, making the lack of surprise understandable. The data reveals that longs liquidated in the last 24 hours amounted to approximately $262 million (89.9%) of the total liquidations. Short liquidations also occurred in the same period, accounting for almost 10% of the total liquidations in the past 24 hours, with $25.6 million in long liquidations. Despite the bearish trend in the market, one trader executed the largest single liquidation in the period, an LTCUSD swap valued at $3.92 million, on Binance. Bitcoin Slumps Below $30,000 The global crypto market cap has also slumped below the $1.3 trillion mark with a value of $1.256 trillion at the time of writing, down by nearly 5% in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin has lost more than $20 billion to its market cap in the past week, down by nearly 4%, indicating selling pressure. Though the top crypto saw a slight uptrend on Tuesday that pushed its price to still trade as high as $30,359, the asset has seen a bearish trend since then. However, the cryptocurrency market is not all doom and gloom as some traders have managed to turn a profit by trading other cryptocurrencies. The current bearish trend has highlighted the importance of diversification for traders who want to minimize losses. It is worth noting that traders who shorted Bitcoin in the hope of the asset’s price moving upwards are experiencing significant losses as the cryptocurrency market slumps. However, as the crypto market continues to experience volatility, it’s important to note that losses in trading are not uncommon. Additionally, it’s important to keep a level head and not panic when faced with losses. The market is constantly fluctuating and traders should have a long-term outlook rather than focusing on short-term gains. Despite the current market being challenging for some traders, the crypto space continues to evolve. Yesterday, a proposal to make PancakeSwap (CAKE) scarce to prevent the token from collapsing was submitted. The latest proposal for CAKE involves implementing an annual inflation rate of 3% and 5% to transition towards a more sustainable staking model. The main objective is to ensure low staking inflation for CAKE, with the real yield coming from PancakeSwap’s revenue. The proposed structure aims to provide incentives for long-term CAKE staking.

The feature will have zero maker and taker fees, meaning there will be no margin for the exchange. Makers create orders and wait for them to be filled, while takers remove liquidity by taking available orders.  The availability of spot trading means users can now buy and sell bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) immediately in addition to trading derivatives in which the payment and delivery of the underlying asset are made on a future date. It also means sophisticated traders in one place will be able to set up multi-leg complex strategies involving both the spot market and futures and options contracts.

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization tripped early Wednesday, falling first below $30,000 for the second time in three days, and hours later, below $29,000 for the first time in more than a week. BTC was recently trading at about $28,930, down about 4.6% from Tuesday, same time, and far from its heights last week when a moderately encouraging consumer price index (CPI) and renewed investor optimism buoyed markets.  Investors' mood soured on Wednesday after a sobering U.K. inflation report and massive sell order on Binance. ""One way or another, the hot U.K. CPI report that we got in today's European session made the market more vulnerable and may have been the piece of macroeconomic data that pushed that large seller to pull the trigger, which led to a cascade of sell orders as we dropped below $30,000,"" Matt Weller, global head of research at online broker Forex.com, told CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program.  Ether continued its mirroring of BTC this week, falling around 7.1% to trade at around $1,945. The second-largest crypto in market value topped $2,100 on Tuesday after tumbling on Monday along with most other major altcoins. The second largest crypto in market value had been on an upswing in the days following the much-ballyhooed Ethereum Shanghai upgrade, the final step in the platform's shift from a proof-of-work to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake protocol.  APT, the token of layer 1 blockchain Aptos, and ARB, the native crypto of layer 2 blockchain Arbitrum, recently plunged about 10% and 13%, respectively. The CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of the crypto market's overall performance, was recently down 6.2%.

In an email to CoinDesk, Markus Levin, co-founder of XYO Network, a cryptography-backed oracle network that anonymously collects and certifies data with a geographic component, noted ""a tremendous amount of anxiety in the market right now, particularly when it comes to macroeconomic conditions.""  ""The U.K.’s higher-than-expected inflation numbers seem to be hitting a bit too close to home, both in the U.S. and in other countries where monetary policy is tightening and fears of a recession are growing,"" Levin wrote. ""It seems as though all these macroeconomic concerns may finally be catching up with bitcoin.""  He added that after bitcoin's strong gains in recent weeks, ""it's not surprising to see consolidation. Crypto markets have always been particularly susceptible to price fluctuations, so none of this should be cause for panic.”  Biggest Gainers  There are no gainers in CoinDesk 20 today.

The traditional gaming world has tentpole franchises that haven’t made in revenue over their lifespan what some Web3 games are worth. Yet. you can find plenty of people that have played a chapter of Grand Theft Auto, Halo, or have joined a multiplayer skirmish in PUBG or Call of Duty.  Some of these games are memes-of-the-moment; PUBG seemed omnipresent in 2017-2018 with its fast-paced mobile-friendly action but is not so big anymore.  But it's likely harder to find someone that’s done the same for a Web3 game. Mention PUBG around gamers and most will know it. Can the same be said about a Web3 game? In a report from last week, DappRadar argued that Asia is going to dominate Web3 gaming. It bases this response on a survey where 48.6% of respondents said that blockchain games “seem interesting.”  But what about after they give them a try? Are they still interesting?  Square Enix thinks there’s a market. The studio behind the Final Fantasy game franchise, which is as close to the holy canon as it gets for gamers, is apparently bullish on the vertical, having recently unveiled a trailer for its first web3 game.  Its fans, though, aren’t as sold.  Some of the highest-rated comments in response to the video are overwhelmingly negative.  “How do I dislike a video more than once,” said J Miki. “With this rate, the next Final Fantasy will be the final fantasy,” added another.
