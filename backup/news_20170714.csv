42379607,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8JHMz,1500067850,US Congressman: Cryptocurrencies Need Tighter Rules,"A Republican member of the US House of Representatives has called for tighter anti-money laundering controls for digital currencies.  Congressman Dana Rohrabacher was speaking during a floor debate on the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act, a funding measure for the US military that was ultimately passed earlier today.  After touching on the ever-growing controversy of Russian involvement in the 2016 presidential election, Rohrabacher shifted gears to discuss cryptocurrencies, arguing that ""people with bitcoins living in despotic regimes throughout the world have the opportunity to protect their assets from abusive and corrupt governments"", according to a transcript of that debate.  Ideological support aside, Rohrabacher pushed for more oversight into the identities of those who transact using digital currencies, stating:  ""I believe we should encourage digital currencies to implement full anti-money laundry and know-your-customer standards. These protection should empower both our law enforcement and national security professionals to keep terrorists' financing under control, to protect our freedom of using digital currencies...and keep America in the lead of this technological advance.""  Yet prior to those remarks, Rohrabacher dismissed the idea of outlawing digital currencies altogether, positing that ""banning digital currencies will not prevent terrorists from using them any more than banning guns will prevent criminals from using them"".  The issue of digital currency regulation has gathered steam in Congress in the past year, as seen by the emergence of initiatives like the Congressional Blockchain Caucus and the filing of bills which call for deeper study into the subject.  As reported previously, the Combating Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Counterfeiting Act of 2017, introduced in May, includes provisions that seeks to bring digital currency exchanges and transaction services under federal statutes.

42379617,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8JHap,1500064832,GDAX Plans to Suspend Bitcoin Withdrawals If UASF Activates,"Digital currency exchange platform GDAX has revealed its contingency plans in the event a controversial bitcoin scaling proposal is activated.  As reported earlier today by CoinDesk, BIP 148, which triggers a so-called user-activated soft fork, or UASF, to activate the Segregated Witness (SegWit) scaling solution, are pushing ahead with their plans despite the popularity of another scaling proposal, Segwit2x, which pairs the activation of SegWit with an increase to the size of the network's transaction blocks three months later.  Yet if SegWit2x doesn't get enough support by August 1st and BIP 148 takes hold without enough of the bitcoin ecosystem support of its particular transaction chain, bitcoin could split into two competing assets. It's a prospect that led GDAX, which is operated by startup Coinbase, to announce last night that, in the event the UASF happens, it will temporarily halt deposits and withdrawals and could take further action.  GDAX general manager Adam White wrote that the exchange could take action in the event that either one chain emerges as the stronger one or the two co-exist as separate chains, explaining:  ""In either scenario we will implement safeguards to ensure the safety of our customers' funds. For example, we will temporarily suspend the deposit and withdrawal of bitcoin on GDAX and may pause the trading of bitcoin as well. This decision will be based on our assessment of the technical risks posed by the fork, such as replay attacks and other factors that could create network instability.""  Coinbase was a signatory of an agreement struck in May between startups and miners in the industry, which led to the development of the Segwit2x proposal. A second beta version of that software is expected to be released today.  Want to stay up to date on the latest bitcoin scaling developments?

42379618,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8JHc5,1500059733,Egyptian Regulators Kill Rumor Domestic Banks Might Handle Bitcoin,"Egypt's central bank recently shot down rumors that may move to allow banks in the country to handle cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.  Those rumors first appeared on social media, according to reports, prompting the Central Bank of Egypt, through deputy governor Gamal Negm, to deny them.  ""For stability of the Egyptian banking system, the banks deal with the official currencies only, and never deal with any virtual currencies,"" Negm told Egyptian economics magazine Amwal Al Ghad last month. Washington, DC-based publication Al-Monitor, which covers Egyptian news, reported on the situation yesterday.  It's a development that comes as more countries weigh legal frameworks to establish some kind of standing for the technology under domestic law.  To date, Japan has emerged as an early adopter of new rules that establish bitcoin as a kind of legal payment method, though countries like India and Russia, among others, have been pursuing such frameworks.  Egypt's, like other parts of the region, has a nascent cryptocurrency market, serviced by startups such as BitOasis as well as local exchangers, according to LocalBitcoins.

42379610,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8JHS1,1500055563,Albanian Central Bank Issues Warning to Cryptocurrency Investors,"Albania's central bank calling on potential investors to avoid buying digital currencies, according to a new report.  According to the English-language weekly Tirana Times, the central bank stated that it hasn't issued any licensure to businesses brokering or exchanging digital currencies in Albania.  ""As a result, every company that is involved in these operations in the Republic of Albania is not licensed and its activity does not comply with the regulatory and supervisory framework of the Bank of Albania,” the bank reportedly said.  It's a missive that largely echoes those issued by other central banks in the past several years. In some of those cases, investors were warned to avoid specific digital currencies, including bitcoin or Onecoin, the latter of which has earned the particular ire of central banks and regulators worldwide.  As with officials at institutions like the Central Bank of Armenia, Albania's central bank suggested that investors avoid buying digital currencies, pointing to more regulated products instead.  ""One should orient investments toward financial products and instruments offered by institutions licensed and supervised by the Bank of Albania and the Financial Supervisory Authority,” the message stated.  It's unclear at this time which businesses in Albania would be effected should the central bank move to enforce its stance more concretely, though LocalBitcoins lists a handful of traders in cities including Tirana and Elbasan.

42379608,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8JHPV,1500051662,Ether Prices Fall Below $190 Amid Broader Crypto Price Decline,"Ether prices fell below $190 today amid a wider drop in cryptocurrency markets.  The price slipped to about $183 as of press time, per CoinDesk data, a decline of roughly 13% since it opened the day at $210.81.  According to WorldCoinIndex, ether (the cryptocurrency of the ethereum network) is trading at $183.41 on South Korea-based Bithumb, the world's most voluminous exchange for the token.  The move comes just three days after ether fell below $200 to hit a 40-day low, representing a more than 50% decline from the $400-odd prices seen in early June. According to CoinDesk data, prices were still well above $300 on June 14, after crossing the $100 mark for the first time in May.  The drop in the price of ether comes during a broader decline in cryptocurrency markets in recent days. Data from CoinMarketCap.com reveals that the collective market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies has fallen below $80bn, after climbing as high as $115bn last month.  Bitcoin prices are down about 6.5% at press time, sliding to $2,209.41 after opening the day at $2,364.52.

42379611,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8JHVn,1500046758,The Segwit2x Boycott: Bitcoin's UASF Isn't Backing Down From August Deadline,"Much of the bitcoin community is resistant to the idea of centralized control.  So it shouldn't come as a surprise that some have developed a similar opposition to bitcoin scaling proposals that appear to have centralized leadership.  And, some would argue there's no bigger offender in this vein than Segwit2x.  A majority of major mining pools have pledged to trigger Segwit2x with their combined computing power by the end of this month, activating a long-awaited (though contentious) code change known as Segregated Witness (SegWit) that's been at the center of bitcoin's scaling debate. Later on, it would set the network down a road to a possible hard fork.  But, a sizable group of bitcoin users isn't looking to follow the lead of mining pools.  Mistrustful of this mining group, especially its particularly large players, some users are moving forward with a controversial proposal called BIP 148 on August 1.  If mining pools do indeed lock in SegWit by the end of the month, UASF supporters might not need to move forward with BIP 148. But they aren't sure if mining pools will follow through.  ""Unfortunately a few miners ... have a record of manipulation, so their signaling for SegWit2x can't be trusted,"" blockchain startup founder and BIP 148 supporter Ragnar Lifthrasir told CoinDesk.  BIP 148 seeks to enact a user-activated soft fork (UASF) which would find node operators upgrading to SegWit.  Yet, the move is interesting because of Segwit2x's popularity and the recent commitment from mining pools to activate SegWit before August. When asked about this, the UASF's GitHub maintainer, Miłosz Kwiatkowski, responded similar to Lifthrasir, telling CoinDesk:  ""Probably because some miners have not made themselves look very trustworthy in the past, and some are actively plotting an attack on the network in the future.""  Kwiatkowski added users want to ""feel protected"" in the case mining pools do not follow through with the Segwit2x agreement.  Mental tool  Mistrust isn't the only reason some users continue to support the BIP 148 path.  Some believe the expectation of a UASF activation could change what mining pools do and whether or not they follow through with upgrades to the network.  Lifthrasir referenced litecoin as an example, noting how mining pools united around SegWit to upgrade the lesser-known cryptocurrency earlier this year. He believes miners only did so after the litecoin community rallied around a UASF, since this type of soft fork could undermine miner's perceived influence.  ""To me, Segwit2x is equivalent to the litecoin roundtable, a way for miners to adopt SegWit before the users do it for them,"" Lifthrasir said.  He believes the same is already happening on bitcoin.  ""BIP 148 is already succeeding in two ways. First, the current all-time high for miners signaling for SegWit is a result of the threat of BIP 148,"" he said.  The original SegWit stalled for months at about 30% hashrate, but around the time BIP148 saw increased interest, this support saw an increase to roughly 45%.  Although Lifthrasir isn't taking the mining pool's Segwit2x pledge for granted, he believes they probably will trigger the change since it's in their own interest.  This idea could be a relieving thought, as support for BIP 148 hasn't grown very much over the past month. And while it's success relies in large part on the support of major bitcoin exchanges and companies, with two weeks to go, most have not taken a public position on it.  If not enough of the bitcoin ecosystem supports the BIP148 chain, bitcoin could split into two competing assets.  'Boycott on steroids'  That's why BIP 148 is highly controversial.  While Bitcoin Core contributors, for example, are supportive of upgrading bitcoin to support SegWit, many are wary of doing it the way BIP 148 lays out.  Some of bitcoin's most active protocol developers don't support BIP 148. Bitcoin protocol startup Chaincode co-founder Alex Morcos and Blockstream CTO Greg Maxwell are both outspoken opponents. And Bitcoin Core contributor David Harding called it a ""boycott on steroids.""  Although deadlines for both BIP 148 and SegWit2x are approaching, there are other longer-term options for boosting transaction capacity, one by way of a different UASF. The upside is that these could be less disruptive in that they require less action from mining pools. The downside is the longer time to activation.  Still, despite this divide, some developers and users plan to move forward with BIP 148 on August 1. In this way, it's perhaps been more of a user-driven change, with users such as Coinkite co-founder and CEO Rodolfo Novak and developer Damian Mee advocating for the specific proposal change from early on.  Lifthrasir concluded:  ""BIP 148 is about more than activating SegWit, it's about activating user sovereignty.""

42379600,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8GmLN,1500037206,"State of Blockchain Survey: The Future of Bitcoin, Ethereum and ICOs","Blockchains boomed in Q2 2017.  Bitcoin  crossed the $40bn mark for market cap, ether rallied over 700% and the combined value of all blockchain-based tokens in existence shot north of $105bn (exceeding financial giants like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley).  Without a doubt, the crypto tokens underlying a growing universe of blockchain protocols now comprises its own independent asset class, unique from any that came before it. And the proof is in the numbers.  Total blockchain venture capital for the year has already been exceeded by ICO fundings for the first time, and the trend has only accelerated since.  It's now routine for ICOs to raise more than $100m, with multiple projects within the last 30 days accumulating nine-digit sums (based on the current value of the bitcoin and ether contributed, of course). Most have set all-time crowdfunding records, only to have them broken days or weeks later.    In short, a new wave of investment interest has led both retail investors and institutional funds to line up to take advantage of the growing appetite for new tokens.    As part of CoinDesk's forthcoming State of Blockchain Q2 2017 report, we're seeking to better understand how the blockchain industry views these history-making trends – from both a positive and a negative perspective.

42379602,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8GmMd,1500033655,Bitcoin and the Benefits of 'Coopetition',"Jameson Lopp is a software engineer at BitGo, creator of statoshi.info and founder of bitcoinsig.com.  In this opinion piece, Lopp makes an impassioned argument for the need for more cooperation between the players in the bitcoin space and the putting aside of vitriol and rivalry in the interests of growing a system to last for many years to come.      As I have extensively argued in my writings, it's not possible for any of us to fully understand bitcoin, and it may not even be possible for us to steer it onto a course we desire.  We're learning more about the system as we go along.  Regardless of what point you may be at on this chart, we’re all huddled together on this life raft in an ocean of financial turmoil, trying to figure out how to build it into a battle cruiser.  We all know how the story begins. On an obscure cryptography mailing list in 2008, someone using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto posted a white paper, stating, ""I've been working on a new electronic cash system that's fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party.""  Nakamoto was far from the first to propose electronic cash, and many cypherpunks had grown weary of the slew of failed attempts over the decades.  Many of those who responded to Satoshi poked and prodded the proposal, claiming that it could never work in practice due to fundamentally flawed assumptions in the scalability or game theory of the system.  The names of those first few respondents to Satoshi will be lost to history. The name of the man who responded differently shall never be forgotten: Hal Finney.  Where most cypherpunks cynically saw only the potential for failure, he saw the potential for success. Never mind that Hal had previously devised his own system of digital money called Reusable Proof of Work, which was also based upon Hashcash.  He was focused on the big picture.  Hal realized that he too had once thought that systems would fail for similar reasons, but he had been wrong before and wasn't going to make that mistake again.  Hal cooperated with Satoshi over the coming months, finding many bugs in Satoshi’s code and making it more robust. He mined many bitcoins with his CPU and received the first ever bitcoin transaction between peers. Hal went a step beyond being an adversary to the proposal; he brought a builder’s mindset to the game.  I bring this all up because today I see many bitcoiners acting like the first respondents to Satoshi – overly pessimistic from years of adversarial thinking. When you're involved in public discourse about the future of bitcoin, I hope you’ll ask yourself: ""What would Hal do?""  Several years ago, Balaji Srinivasan [CEO and co-founder of 21] gave an introduction to bitcoin presentation in which he stated that bitcoin mining is a ""coopetition."" What he meant by this was that miners are competing 24/7/365 to find the next valid block and yet simultaneously they are cooperating to secure and extend the same blockchain.  This got me to thinking: perhaps we've been going about this all wrong. Perhaps we've fallen into a trap of our own making because we're too focused on competition and, by throwing cooperation out the window, we are missing opportunities to grow this ecosystem.  Complementary components  I make no claim to being an expert in game theory, but my understanding is that every game is comprised of the same basic elements:  Players  Rules  Strategies  Payoffs  Let's have a look at the players and rules with respect to the game called bitcoin.  The four types of players in games of capitalism are customers, suppliers, competitors and complementors. It is important to realize that none of the players in the game are fixed.  An effective strategy may entail bringing in new players or pushing out existing ones. For example, if you only have one supplier, you may want to pay for other suppliers to enter the game in order to make the raw material market for your business more competitive, or even to commoditize your supplier's products. On the other hand, if you are considering becoming a new player as a supplier, you should try to get compensated up front by your future customers for the competition you create, because you’ll be saving them money.  Within the players element, we can use the concept of the ""value net"" to express the relations amongst the players.  The value net is a way to explain the interdependencies amongst the players. There are both vertical and horizontal symmetries in the value net.  Vertically, it demonstrates that users and suppliers are both value creators. Organizations should listen to the needs of both players in order to maximize the value of the system.  Horizontally, complementors are just the mirror image of competitors. Customers value your product more when there are many complementors, whereas they value your product less when there are many substitutors.  Understanding this relationship highlights a deficiency in common competitive practices: only focusing on how to eliminate one's competitors. Instead of thinking of business as war, organizations should also attempt to develop commodity complementors, which in the long-term increases the overall value to their customers.  By understanding these two symmetries, the value net gives us greater potential for successful application of game theory.  Instead of focusing on only the conventional players like customers and competitors, the value net shows that organizations actually have four player types to target when developing strategies.  Value net specifics  I brainstormed a bit, trying to think of what some of the different players are in bitcoin's value net. This is by no means a comprehensive list, and I hope some of you can contribute to it so that we can improve our understanding of bitcoin's game theory!  Users increase the value of the system by creating demand and network effect:  A huge number of use cases. Potentially everyone in the world who is old enough to use money  The unbanked use bitcoins to store and transact value because there are few other available options  Those seeking shelter from inflation find appeal in bitcoin's well-defined money supply  Those seeking financial privacy and censorship resistance seek an electronic form of cash  High-risk speculators ""HODL"" bitcoins, decreasing the supply available on the market  Entrepreneurs seek to build upon bitcoin as a platform  Libertarians and anarchists seek freedom from the controls of nations and central banks.  Suppliers increase value by adding resources to the system:  Developers add utility to bitcoin by writing software  Miners dedicate capital to securing bitcoin from computational attacks  Full nodes validate and replicate blockchain data, distributing it across the globe and securing against Sybil attacks  Traders and market makers provide liquidity to the markets and help them to grow.  Competitors decrease the value of system by acting as substitutes:  Fiat  Other payment rails  Precious metals and stores of value  Other crypto assets  Central banks.  Complementors increase the value of the system by bundling other utility with bitcoin. These include:  Consumer apps and use cases on top of bitcoin  Wallets, tumblers or even non-monetary apps like time-stamping services  Merchants that accept bitcoin, especially unique merchants like darknet markets  Second-layer networks make transactions faster and cheaper and enable many new use cases.  An interesting revelation we see from the value net is that there are three player types we can target to increase the value of the system without having to threaten our competitors. I pose to you that these paths are probably easier and will have a greater return on investment.  Remember that we are vastly outnumbered and out-capitalized by our competitors at this point. We've heard that 21, Bitmain, Blockchain, Blockstream, Coinbase, nChain, and plenty of other entities in this space have hundreds of millions of dollars in their coffers, but that's still a drop in the bucket compared to what we are facing.  I pose to you that we don't want strong competitors to feel threatened by bitcoin until it's too late for them to respond.  The crypto asset industry is in competition, but not just within itself – we’re in competition with many other industries. For example, we’re in competition with all high-tech industries over a limited supply of software engineers.  As such, we should desire to foster a welcoming community for developers. I'd point to ethereum as a good model in that regard.  Development  In terms of software development, we already see ""coopetition"" amongst developers on a single team.  Unlike corporate software development, there are no project managers or architects passing down feature requirements and specifications from on high. Instead, multiple developers may propose similar competing changes that attempt to solve the same perceived problems. If a proposal begins to gain traction, other developers will jump in and probe the idea, trying to find weaknesses and cooperating with the proposer to improve it.  On a related note, I’ve observed a fundamental conflict between how the vast majority of software development works versus how public consensus networks operate.  Most software developers take the approach of envisioning how they want the system to work, writing the code, and then deploying it. In bitcoin, you have some groups of developers who also take that approach, historically with poor results. Then you have other groups of developers who consider the existing rules of the system to be constraints within which they have to work in order to be able to deploy changes; that methodology tends to be more successful.  Now, I'm sure that this is a particularly contentious point and many of you have changes you desire to see implemented in bitcoin that have been frustratingly failing to activate.  Perhaps we can just dismiss it as another inefficiency of a decentralized system, but it seems that it could have a chilling effect upon development and result in a lot of wasted resources working on features that end up never being used.  As a former supporter of Bitcoin XT, I know full well the feeling of seeing months of work and waiting go up in smoke.  I hope that we can break out of this cycle of failed initiatives.  Bitcoin businesses  A plethora of businesses based upon the bitcoin platform have emerged and many of them are in direct competition with each other for customers seeking to fill specific use cases.  And yet, many of these businesses form partnerships and trade services with each other in order to form mutually beneficial relationships that leverage the strengths of each business.  I can tell you that this is certainly true for us at BitGo as we wish to provide our services to as much of the ecosystem as possible.  It's clear that the root cause of the rift in the scaling debate is conflicting needs between different types of bitcoin users, and enterprises that service users who transact smaller values are feeling the pressure to improve their customer experience.  As a result, many are trying to change the rules of the bitcoin game, while other players in the game consider a rule change to be hazardous to the value of their own use cases. Due to the strength of the status quo in this game, we find ourselves at an impasse.  Crypto society  People within the ecosystem broadcast their thoughts across mailing lists, forums, chat rooms and social media. They argue about the nature of bitcoin and the direction it can go, trying to earn respect and social capital.  Unfortunately this process has degenerated during the years of scaling debate.  Tribalism has taken a toll on the community and fractured discussion; many developers left the bitcoin mailing list to avoid drama and harassment. I've been tracking mailing list activity and it continues to decline.  I think one of the greatest problems is the classification of folks as ""small blockers"" or ""large blockers,"" amongst more derogatory names being slung around. This is a very nuanced discussion; we should avoid grouping people together based upon similar viewpoints.  In fact, it's probably best to avoid talking about people or groups of people at all. We should be talking about ideas, not people. The vitriol and tribalism has led to communication breakdowns. I've lost count of how many times I've had people privately message me to let me know that they aren’t responding to a recent conversation because they blocked or muted one of the primary participants.  The blocking has even gotten to the point that it causes misunderstandings.  Take, for example, a recent Twitter blunder where ""Alice"" attacked ""Bob"" for saying that he thought bitcoin needed a CEO, but Bob was actually arguing against bitcoin needing a CEO.  Alice lost that context because ""Charlie"" had blocked her, thus entire portions of the tweet thread were invisible to her and the meaning drastically changed. In this situation no one is to blame and yet everyone is to blame. Similar problems have happened in the past on the /r/Bitcoin subreddit when the removal of comments by moderators combined with complex CSS to automatically expand collapsed threads also caused portions of the conversation to be imperceptibly removed, thus changing its meaning.  https://twitter.com/lopp/statuses/636291494484291584  https://twitter.com/lopp/statuses/630512763153051648  I speak from personal experience here, as someone who has had posts removed from /r/Bitcoin, been attacked by trolls on every platform I’ve used, been banned from /r/buttcoin for posting inconvenient facts, and even as a moderator of the Bitcoin XT subreddit.  I consider every bitcoin-specific forum to be flawed: they all tend to be skewed due to the tribalism of either the moderators or the users, who are nearly guaranteed to have some sort of vested interest in seeing their personal vision of bitcoin promoted. That’s why these days I mostly stick to Twitter, where no one stifles my speech.  It seems to me that back when we were all using the same few forums we were doing a better job at fostering coopetition, but now the focus on competition has divided the community and wasted our most valuable resource: time.  Cooperation increases value and increased value can foster increased cooperation, creating a virtuous cycle. If you spew vitriol at bitcoiners online, you aren't just hurting your target – you're hurting us all.  Mining  I mentioned that this presentation was inspired by a reference to mining coopetition, though at this point I think it's worth digging deeper into this example so that we might compare it to the other forms of coopetition already covered.  In the early days, folks were solo mining with CPUs and then GPUs, but it didn’t take them long to figure out that cooperating and pooling resources offered more consistent returns. Pooled mining also expanded the crypto economy by creating a business opportunity for people with the operational skills to maintain a reliable and trustworthy pool.  As you're surely aware, there are a handful of companies that now control a significant portion of bitcoin's total hashing power. You're also aware that any entity that gains over 50% of hashing power (or possibly around 30% with selfish mining strategies) can effectively control which blocks get added to the tip of the blockchain over a long period of time.  So, it's not a stretch to imagine that a handful of mining companies could communicate in private and decide to form a cartel by working together to orphan all blocks minted by entities other than themselves. They could thus shut out the rest of the competition and split a larger slice of the block rewards and fees amongst a smaller number of miners. Why don’t we see this cartelization happening?  I pose to you that it’s because they know that bitcoin is more valuable when are building on top of each other's work rather than throwing away large chunks of work for a short-term gain.  Miners are cooperating to secure and extend the same blockchain; if some miners change their protocol to be incompatible with the rest and the blockchain forks as a result, these two sets of miners are no longer in coopetition – they are only in competition. This drastically changes the game theory and equilibrium of the system and also reduces security because they’re no longer cooperating to extend the same chain, thus making each new chain fork cheaper to attack computationally.  This is but one of many reasons why we should be cautious to avoid contentious forks.  The rules of the game  Bitcoin is a very interesting game that none of us are being forced to play – we all have our own incentives.  But I think that a fundamental disconnect between different sides in the scalability debate is that they are playing different games.  Those who view bitcoin as digital gold and accept a trade-off of higher transaction fees in return for lower cost of full blockchain validation believe that the rules of the protocol are intentionally hard to change and we should work within the confines of the current rules to improve the system’s scalability without compromising forward compatibility.  Those who view bitcoin as a payment system that needs to have low transaction fees in order to be competitive and reach mass adoption believe that the rules of the system must change in order for it to evolve and increase in utility and value.  Neither of these views is necessarily wrong, they're just different games. It's a lot harder to foster coopetition when you're not playing the same game. Is it possible that this is an irreconcilable difference? Sure. Bitcoin is fundamentally based upon ideology; we just use science to bring our ideology into reality by running a fully validating node that automatically enforces the rules to which we agree.  But I hope you agree with me that this game is more enjoyable and more valuable when it has more players. Should bitcoin endure a permanent chain split, I fear it would set precedent for more fracturing in the future, causing further loss of network effect and greater confusion over the identity of bitcoin for mainstream users.  With regard to rule changes, I think it's worth looking at the competition and how they end up being affected. I pose to you that any rule change bitcoin makes can also be made by its competition in the crypto ecosystem.  If bitcoin can change to support huge blocks, what's to stop litecoin or ethereum or whatever from doing the same?  I suspect that changing the protocol to target low on-chain transaction fees will effectively result in a cryptocurrency price war with a race to the bottom, and price wars tend to end in pyrrhic victories.  Cypherpunks, not cypherpricks  If you're not familiar with ""A Cypherpunk’s Manifesto"", give it a read. While privacy is but one of many aspects integral to bitcoin, I think the spirit of coopetition rings true in Eric Hughes’ writing.  I find these excerpts to be particularly relevant:    ""Cypherpunks write code. We know that someone has to write software to defend privacy, and since we can't get privacy unless we all do, we're going to write it. We publish our code so that our fellow Cypherpunks may practice and play with it. Our code is free for all to use, worldwide.      For privacy to be widespread it must be part of a social contract. People must come together to deploy these systems for the common good. Privacy only extends so far as the cooperation of one's fellows in society. We the Cypherpunks seek your questions and your concerns and hope we may engage you so that we do not deceive ourselves.""    Bitcoin was born from the efforts of cypherpunks. Cypherpunks know the value of open coopetition. I know there's a lot of bad blood in this space and you may be tempted to attack individuals who have offended you, but let’s not waste energy perpetuating a vicious cycle.  Yes, this is an adversarial environment, but in order to foster a constructive environment it must be adversarial in the intellectual sense, not the emotional sense. We have too much left to build to spend time fueling petty squabbles.  What would Hal do?  Coopetition  In highly segmented industries with strong network effects, such as the technology industry, coopetition may be the only way to avoid stagnation.  It is often difficult in the tech industry to get new products off the ground; the market demands technical standards but it can take years of fruitless, cutthroat competition that inhibits the overall health of the market before a clear winner emerges.  Coopetition can help us avoid that by finding win-win scenarios.  I'm sure you’re all familiar with this chart showing the tech adoption lifecycle. Personally, I think we’re still in the innovation phase.  Coopetition can be an extremely valuable strategy for technology dependent upon network effects when they're still trying to bootstrap. Since the early market is small, competing for market share does not make much sense. Instead, in the early market stage, we should focus on creating demand and getting past the tipping point. Coopetition can create a win-win situation for all involved by actually lowering the tipping point for reaching the mainstream market.  If we accept the premise that we don't have the resources to quickly ramp up the entire ecosystem to mass adoption, how do we find the path to get there? I'd argue that once you convince someone to store value in bitcoin, they are incentivized to use their skills and resources to help make the system more valuable. In this manner, we can bootstrap the system organically.  What if, instead of targeting low-value use cases during this bootstrapping phase, we adopted a Tesla-esque strategy instead? That is: court the wealthiest of entities to be early adopters in this system and thus incentivize them to pay for the hard part – innovation of the ecosystem.  This could be high-net-worth individuals looking to diversify their assets, hedge funds, or even tiny nation states with currencies that are now dwarfed by bitcoin. At time of writing, there are 140 countries with M1 money supplieshttps://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2214rank.html smaller than bitcoin's money supply. Surely some of them have far more to gain than to lose by taking a first mover advantage in the global transition to crypto assets.  The tricky part here is that bitcoin doesn’t have a marketing department. It's up to each of us to spread it like a mind virus; we would need to find people already in the community who can build a bridge to these high-value networks we may wish to target. If you think you fit this criterion or are interested in pursuing the idea, please contact me.  Some people argue that there's an incentive problem with protocol development. Many contributors are unpaid volunteers; so what if, instead of relying upon a poorly defined process for funding protocol development with a scattering of grants and hires by for-profit companies, we created a multisig fund to which enterprises and high-net-worth investors contribute and control in order to hire full-time protocol devs and/or post bounties for feature development?  I don’t think such an idea necessarily needs to be baked into the protocol itself as some cryptocurrencies have done.  These are just a few random thoughts; there are certainly many more unexplored possibilities. I suppose what I'm really trying to say here is that we should take a long-term view of how to play the bitcoin game. We aren't building a technology that we want to take down a path that causes it to fail or become obsolete in a decade. We're building a system that must last for generations.  The lifespan of the average fiat currency is 27 years – imagine the global confidence bitcoin will acquire if we can exceed that mark. I'm confident that we can find safe ways to take us down the path to mass adoption – all that is required is creativity and perseverance.  Vires in Numeris    ""I cannot give you the formula for success, but I can give you the formula for failure, which is: Try to please everybody.""      – Herbert Swope    Bitcoin clearly can't be everything that we all want it to be at this stage, otherwise we risk it become nothing any of us want it to be. We're currently working with what amounts to a very small pie.  Many of you are rightfully frustrated because you are watching use cases being priced out of bitcoin, effectively shrinking that slice of the pie. You may feel powerless to stop portions of bitcoin's user base from defecting to other crypto assets.  For your own peace of mind, I recommend letting go of anger and frustration. Accept that bitcoin is beyond your control and instead focus on figuring out the things that you can control with regard to bitcoin's value net. This is how we can grow the pie. We can always compete later over how to slice it up.  When developers, businesses and users switch from coopetition to competition, it makes us all weaker.  The great thing about coopetition is that it allows us to leverage free market capitalism to accelerate innovation, while still retaining the strength afforded to us by network effects. We're all huddled together on a life raft in an ocean of financial turmoil; instead of waging war with each other and splintering the raft, let's build a warship so that we may raid the coffers of the overconfident bankers in their overladen galleons.  My fellow bitcoiners, I look forward to coopeting with you all for many years to come.  Vires in numeris.

42379596,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8GmF5,1500026404,UK Judge: 'No Doubt' Smart Contract Law Update Should Be Considered,"The top judge for England and Wales believes that U.K. law may need to be updated to account for blockchain-based smart contracts.  John Thomas, Baron Thomas of Cwmgiedd, serves as the Lord Chief Justice for England and Wales, and is effectively the most senior judge in whole of the U.K.  Late last month, in previously unreported comments, Thomas gave remarks during a lecture event held bi-annually by the U.K. Law Commission, an independent body that monitors legal developments in the country and recommend reform actions to the government.  What he said: Thomas' speech focused on legal reform in light of 21st century developments, advocating for actions to keep British law up to date with the digital economy.  During his remarks, Thomas commented on efforts by the European Commission – the executive arm of the European Union – to harmonize its rules with an increasingly digitized economy. He pointed to the bloc's work on digital currencies and blockchain, going on to suggest that the U.K. should pursue a similar agenda.  He told event attendees:  ""Certainly, the European Commission takes the view that legislative change will be needed to deal with new forms of contract such as the blockchain and smart contracts. I have no doubt that we must consider whether our law (as it will then be) will need similar legislative updating.""  Why it matters: The past year has seen a number of instances in which smart contracts and blockchain-based signatures are given a degree of legal representation, seen more recently in U.S. states like Arizona and Vermont.  Most recently, the state of Delaware cleared legislation that recognizes business records that are tied to a distributed ledger system.  In his speech, Thomas notably questioned whether such a process should be left to judicial consideration – ""developing the law in the traditional manner"" – in the context of the digital age.  While he wasn't actively pushing for changes to U.K. rules to account for the technology, his endorsement for a process that would consider such a move is a major one, given his position.

42379591,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8GmA3,1500019212,Enterprise Ethereum Alliances Unveils New Technical Steering Committee,"The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance has revealed a new technical steering committee, five months after the group first launched.  As CoinDesk reported at the group's launch in February, the alliance is backed by a broad array of blockchain startups and enterprise businesses, including Merck, Toyota, and even the state government of Illinois. The group tripled in size in May, adding more than 80 companies to its roster.  Now, the group is laying down some of its governance foundations, instituting a new technical steering committee that will be focused on advancing the EntEth 1.0 reference software.  Pulling from the alliance members, the committee will also oversee seven new working groups, each consisting of industry players. Specific areas that those working groups will focus on include token issuances, banking, healthcare, insurance, advertising, legal and supply chain finance.  ""The EEA has made the largest commitment to member-driven working groups in the industry focusing on innovative blockchain technologies and applications to solve real-world problems,"" Jeremy Millar, a founding board member of the group, said in a statement, adding:  ""Many of the blockchain industry's best and brightest have agreed to contribute their leadership and energy as a chair for an EEA work group. We thank them and all the working group members for their support and efforts.""  Alex Batlin, global blockchain lead for BNY Mellon, will serve as the chair of the steering committee as well as the token working group. Other chair roles are filled in by executives from JPMorgan Chase, Merck, and the ethereum development community ConsenSys, among others.
