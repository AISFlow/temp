42407553,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZQati,1727133323,"Polymarket Reportedly Seeks $50M in Funding, Mulls Token as Election Bets Surge","Riding high on U.S. election betting fever, crypto-based prediction market platform Polymarket is seeking $50 million in fresh funding, according to an article Monday in tech news site The Information.  The New York-based startup is also considering issuing its own token, according to the article, which cited unnamed sources. Investors in the proposed round would receive warrants entitling them to buy the tokens should Polymarket go ahead with the issuance plan, the Information said.  The article said Polymarket would use the potential token ""as a way for users to validate the outcome of real-world events.""  It was not immediately clear whether this would be a supplement, alternative, or replacement for UMA Protocol, the ""oracle"" service Polymarket uses to resolve markets and adjudicate disputes via community votes. The Information did not mention UMA, and its token was up slightly following the article's publication.  ""Polymarket, at its core, is oracle agonistic,"" the prediction market startup says in its documentation.  Neither Polymarket nor UMA responded immediately to CoinDesk's request for comment.  Breakout year  In May, Polymarket revealed it had raised a combined $70 million over two rounds, one for $25 million and a $45 million Series B led by billionaire Peter Thiel's Founders Found.  The Information article did not specify whether investors in the proposed $50 million round would receive equity or just the token warrants, and mentioned nothing about Polymarket's valuation, which has not been disclosed.  Polymarket is one of this year's breakout success stories, both for the long-obscure niche of prediction markets and for crypto itself. Bets made through the site are programmed into smart contracts on the Polygon blockchain and settled in USDC, a token that trades 1:1 for dollars.  Monthly volume on Polymarket hit an all-time high of $472 million in August, and this month is shaping up to be at least its second-best, with $397 million in trades as of Monday, according to Dune Analytics data.  Traders can use Polymarket to bet on the outcomes of everything from soccer matches to tensions in the Middle East, but the most popular subject by far is the U.S. presidential election, on which bettors have staked nearly $1 billion.  Regulatory restrictions  Under a regulatory settlement, Polymarket blocks users with U.S. IP addresses, although crafty American traders have reportedly gotten around the geofencing using VPNs.  The startup's runaway success this year has been a sore point for Kalshi, a regulated, dollar-denominated prediction market that's been fighting a protracted court battle with its supervisor, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, so it can list contracts on which party will control each house of Congress. The agency has been considering a proposed rule that would ban election event contracts at all the exchanges on its watch, which would push regulation of such activity to the states.  CFTC Chairman Rostin Benham last week said he's got an eye on offshore election-betting platforms that are ""providing exposure to U.S. customers.""  ""If anyone, Polymarket or otherwise, conducts themselves in a way that breaks the law, we will use our civil enforcement authority to make sure that conduct stops,” Behnam said in response to a question at an event in Washington, Bloomberg reported.",POSITIVE,UMA,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | UMA,Marc Hochstein,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/09/23/polymarket-reportedly-seeks-50m-in-funding-mulls-token-as-election-bets-surge,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/473cadb20fe4e7c052f29ddddcf48b15aee79ec0-1920x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Given the sheer size of the transaction, this whale has caught the attention of many Ethereum investors and the broader crypto community. Diamond Hand Whale Moves 15,000 ETH Tokens Spot On Chain, a blockchain analytics platform, revealed on September 22 in an X (formerly Twitter) post that an anonymous Diamond hand whale had transferred 15,000 ETH valued at $38.4 million from their wallet address “0x682” to Kraken, one of the world’s biggest crypto exchanges. Related Reading: Fed Rate Cuts Spurs $1.6 Billion Bitcoin Buying Spree Among Whales, Can BTC Reach $70,000? A Diamond hand whale is a term essentially used to describe traders or investors who HODL their coins, stocks, bonds, silver or bonds for an extensive period without plans to sell, no matter how much the value of the token changes or the market fluctuates. Data from Spot On Chain has revealed that this anonymous Diamond whale had initially conducted two ETH deposits into Kraken, both exceeding $30 million. Coincidentally, these two transactions occurred just before the price of Ethereum experienced a decline. The first transaction saw the whale move 10,000 ETH tokens, worth about $34.2 million to Kraken on July 25, just before the price of Ethereum fell by 7.6%. In the second transaction which occurred on August 20, the diamond hand whale deposited 15,000 ETH, valued at $39.7 million at the time. This substantial ETH transaction had occurred just before a 2.5% decrease in Ethereum’s price. Following this trend, it appears that this particular whale’s ETH deposits may have been carefully calculated and strategic, executing transactions just before a price decrease to avoid a loss. Moreover, the whale’s actions could offer valuable insights, potentially signaling an impending decline in the price of Ethereum. Currently, the diamond hand whale holds 26,639 ETH tokens, worth approximately $69.7 million, with an estimated total profit of $132 million. This massive profit represents an impressive gain of over 86%. Update On Ethereum Price Analysis The price of Ethereum has been relatively stable in recent weeks, experiencing modest gains after ensuring an extensive period of significant bearish activity. According to CoinMarketCap’s data, ETH is trading at $2,640, reflecting a 1.93% increase in the last week and an impressive 13.43% surge over the past seven days. Related Reading: ‘Uptober’ Is Just Around The Corner: Here’s Where Bitcoin Price Is Headed Notably, Ethereum’s bullish momentum has sparked optimism amongst analysts. A prominent crypto analyst identified as ‘Crypto Patel’ on X has set ambitious price targets for Ethereum, predicting that the cryptocurrency could witness a surge between $5,500 to $6,000. He identified the best accumulation zone for investors as between $2,500 to $2,100. Furthermore, the analyst shared his long-term target for ETH, forecasting that the cryptocurrency could experience a price breakout from $8,000 to $10,000.

33913209,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=644002,1727127011,Polkadot Stalls Below $4.5 Even After Agile Coretime Launch: What’s Going On?,"Polkadot (DOT) needs help at spot rates. When writing, DOT is still trading below $4.5 despite the broader recovery. Bitcoin and Ethereum, for example, are trading above local resistances now support, at around $60,000 and $2,400, respectively. DOT Struggling, Bulls Capped Below $4.5 A look at the DOT price action in the daily chart reveals that the coin is trending inside the September 14 to 18 bear range. Even though there were gains on September 18, which has since acted as the base for the current swing high, bulls are not capitalizing on the momentum. Related Reading: SUI Eyes Potential Pullback As RSI Flashes Warning: $1.4 Retest In Sight The immediate liquidation level, marking September 15 highs, is $4.5. If broken, it could trigger a wave of demand that may be the building blocks for more gains, extending the current 18% rally from September lows. Interestingly, DOT bulls are slow to tap into the improving crypto sentiment and break this resistance level. This underwhelming performance also comes even after the introduction of Agile Coretime. According to Polkadot developers, this feature is a crucial component of the next network phase, Polkadot 2.0. Agile Coretime Out As Developers Prepares For Polkadot 2.0 The Agile Coretime rollout, released last week, introduces multiple features that will benefit developers and protocols launched on the platform. Top of the list, developers said Agile Coretime introduces even more flexibility. This is because the feature permits projects to access network resources as needed. They won’t have to be locked into a fixed slot like before. Additionally, Agile Coretime seeks to push scalability higher. To do this, the feature enables adaptable core allocation. Subsequently, higher network efficiency allows the platform to support even more diverse applications. Agile Coretime sets the ball rolling for the eventual activation of Polkadot 2.0. This upgrade sets the stage for overhauling the current resource allocation model, making it more market-driven. Related Reading: Fed Rate Cuts Spurs $1.6 Billion Bitcoin Buying Spree Among Whales, Can BTC Reach $70,000? Moreover, developers will be looking to introduce Asynchronous Backing, which seeks to separate the Relay Chain, which is core to Polkadot and Parachains. The idea is to improve efficiency and drive scalability. Though developers are lining up major developments, DOT is lagging and trending near 2024 lows. DOT’s performance will largely depend on the general market sentiment and Bitcoin or Ethereum’s performance. DOT will likely benefit if these coins break their respective all-time highs in the coming weeks.

Native tokens of layer-1 blockchain Near {{NEAR}} and decentralized computing platform Render {{RNDR}} advanced 18%-20% over the past 24 hours. They were the fastest horses within the broad-market benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index, which gained 1.5% during the same period.  Decentralized machine learning protocol Bittensor (TAO) climbed 17% during the same period, while Livepeer (LPT) added to its gains after Barry Silbert, CEO of crypto investment firm Digital Currency Group (DCG), called the token ""under the radar crypto AI play"" in an X post. The token is a constituent of the Grayscale Decentralized AI Fund, issued by DCG's asset management subsidiary.  Bitcoin, meanwhile, was lagging with a less than 1% gain, battling to reclaim the key 200-day moving average at just below $64,000. Ethereum's ether {{ETH}} showed relative strength with a 3.5% return.  Another notable outperformer was blockchain data availability project Celestia's native token {{TIA}}, up 12% Monday with news about its ecosystem development organization Celestia Foundation raising $100 million investment led by Bain Capital Crypto. The price action was perhaps buoyed by Democratic nominee Kamala Harris reportedly saying at a fundraiser event that she'll be a tech-friendly president and will ""encourage innovative technologies like AI and digital assets.""  A check on traditional markets saw gold breaking new record prices with stocks edging higher, adding to their gains since the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates by 50 basis points on Wednesday.  It was likely the first of many more cuts through next year, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said on Monday. ""Over the next 12 months, we have a long way to come down to get the interest rate to something like neutral,"" Goolsbee said. The Fed's economic projection showed the neutral rate at close to 3%.  Bitcoin could hit new record prices in Q4  Rate cuts brought bitcoin's price lower in 2019, but they might be bullish this time if they happen due to inflation cooling towards 2% instead of economic weakness, Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, said Monday in an interview with CoinDesk Markets Daily.  Thielen predicted BTC breaking out to new all-time highs in the last quarter of the year from its six-month sideways move, citing several catalysts to fuel the rally.  Months between October and March are historically the strongest period for bitcoin, responsible for most of the gains over the year.  The FTX estate may redistribute some $16 billion of assets to creditors in the next months, with a part of those funds flowing back to the crypto assets, Thielen said.  The SEC last week approved listing options for BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF (IBIT), a positive move that paves the way to launch more financial instruments around the ETF and eventually bring more institutional liquidity to the leading asset.  While many crypto investors see uncertainty about who will be voted for the next U.S. president in November, Thielen said that the election ""doesn't really matter"" because government spending and deficits will continue to rise, benefitting BTC.",POSITIVE,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/09/23/ai-related-cryptos-lead-altcoin-surge-bitcoin-breakout-nears-with-several-catalyst-in-q4-analyst,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2997ec65562e59fcfc47431c9954df246574b63a-2400x1256.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42407560,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZQbKA,1727124906,Mango Markets Mulls CFTC Settlement Over Crypto Trading Violations,"Decentralized crypto exchange Mango Markets has already weathered a debilitating multimillion-dollar hack and the expensive regulatory investigations it spawned. The group may soon take another blow: a six-figure settlement with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).  The crypto derivatives trading hub faces CFTC charges for allegedly failing to register as a commodities exchange, for illegally offering services to U.S. customers and failing to check its customers' identities, according to statements in its Discord server and a proposal on its governance page. The DEX allows users to trade perpetual futures contracts.  On Sunday Mango Markets' legal representative disclosed the investigation and proposed a resolution: the exchanges' governing body Mango DAO would pay the CFTC a $500,000 fine. Mango DAO would not admit or deny any wrongdoing but would avoid pending litigation.  The settlement isn't a done deal. It still must be approved by holders of Mango Markets' governance token, MNGO. At press time the proposal was heading toward almost certain approval. Once it clears that hurdle the settlement offer must also be accepted by the CFTC's commissioners.  Mango DAO has ridden this regulatory pain train before. Just last month it voted to offer a six-figure settlement to the Securities and Exchange Commission. It later sent nearly $700,000 in stablecoins to cover a ""fine"" stemming from allegations that it sold MNGO as an unregistered security.  One month before FTX's Nov. 2022 collapse gutted DeFi exchanges on Solana, Mango Markets suffered its own calamity. Self-described game theorist Avi Eisenberg pulled off a ""highly profitable"" market manipulation that wiped the exchange's assets and ultimately landed him in prison.  While Mango Markets got some of its money back from Eisenberg it never recovered financially or reputationally from the blow. The event also drew scrutiny from multiple U.S. regulators, including the CFTC.  Mango DAO has run up $148,176 in legal fees and over $78,000 in additional costs related to its navigation of the ensuing legal thicket, according to a post in its Discord server from its legal representative.

The current explosion in artificial intelligence adoption has spurred more interest in cryptocurrencies, and Bittensor is conspicuously leading in this regard. Related Reading: AAVE Hits New Highs, Breaks Out After 2 Years Of Consolidation – Details TAO has shown an amazing 1,000% price rise over the last year. The digital asset was up by a solid 65% this month. Looking ahead, CoinCodex projects a whopping 243% price rise, maybe reaching $1,827 by October 23, 2024, therefore inspiring investor hope. Right now, Bittensor is trading at $525, slightly below the vital $530 threshold. This shows strong market mood since it indicates an 81% sustained upward push in the past week. Given the good technical indicators and a positive view of the next months, traders are excited to see how high TAO may get. Strong Market Momentum At the moment, Bittensor is riding a wave of strong upward progress. The price went up by 40% after a recent wedge exit, setting the asset up for more gains. Bittensor’s futures open interest has gone from $61 million to $114 million, showing that investors are taking notice. This rise means that more investors are starting new positions, which means that money is coming into TAO. Moreover, the recent price increase has been accompanied by heightened bullish signals. With liquidation for short positions at a yearly high of $1.45 million, people betting against the market are driven from their positions. Long position liquidations, meantime, have been somewhat minimal, just $139,000 over the past week. This pattern shows increasing confidence among investors thinking about the future price movement of Bittensor. Positive Mood And Price Projections Expectations are that this optimism regarding Bittensor will hold. Furthermore, according to CoinCodex, this will result in an increase of up to 240% as the figures could rise to $1,827 come October 23, 2024. Related Reading: Solana Jumps 10% As Fed Eases Rates, Analysts Eye Even Higher Gains The fear & greed index is little changed at 50, and technical indicators are close to neutral. Such a signal is an indicator that investors in the market are staying positive about the prospects of the coin registering more gains ahead. With 16 of his 30 trading days posted in the green over the past 30 days, Bittensor has a 53% success record. Coupled with a 17.69% price volatility, this result suggests a healthy state of the market. Bittensor: Strong Market Signals Bittensor is fairly positioned within the AI coins sphere. Its phenomenal price pump and solid market signals give hope to traders about its prospects. Hence, soaring open interest, a high liquidation rate on short positions, and positive projections for the price indicate that Bittensor may record decent profits in the coming months.

The app will now share information such as a user's IP address and phone number with judicial authorities in cases of potential criminal conduct.  The changes come after Telegram CEO Pavel Durov's arrest in France last month.  Messaging app Telegram made significant changes to its terms of service, chief executive officer Pavel Durov said in a post on the app on Monday.  The app’s privacy conditions now state that Telegram will now share a user’s IP address and phone number with judicial authorities in cases where criminal conduct is being investigated.  Telegram-linked Toncoin {{TON}} declined about 1% after Bloomberg first reported about the changes. The token is currently trading at $5.62.  The changes come after Durov was arrested in France last month, when authorities alleged his company let users abuse the app for illegal activities, including drug trafficking, distribution of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and fraud.  After his arrest, the Russian-born promised changes and said that ""establishing the right balance between privacy and security is not easy,” in a post on the app. Earlier this month, Telegram blocked users from uploading new media in an effort to stop bots and scammers.  Monday's changes depart significantly from the app’s previous disclosure, which stated that that information would only be shared if a user was a suspect of terrorism.  Telegram, one of the most popular messaging apps on the market, previously faced pressure from Russian authorities, who attempted to ban the app in 2018 and led Durov to move to Europe. Telegram offers encrypted messaging, but it is not enabled by default.  The 39-year-old, who denied any charges, has been ordered to stay in France until the investigation is closed.

42407557,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZQb6w,1727117386,Crypto Needs a Purple Mindset,"When Satoshi Nakamoto published the Bitcoin white paper in 2008, nobody could have imagined that the digital asset industry would swell to over $2 trillion today.  Sixteen years into its adoption cycle, the crypto market can no longer be considered a fad or a libertarian casino. Rather, it’s the next evolution of finance. It’s both too big and too important to be treated on a partisan basis.  There are few financial sectors that aren’t being upgraded by the flow of funds in tokenized form. Cross-border payments, remittances, e-commerce, humanitarian aid, FX markets, money market funds, and retail purchases are all beginning to integrate blockchain-based financial rails into their infrastructure.  From migrant workers to Fortune 100 institutions, users are turning to this technology for the same reasons we all started using the internet: the ability to transact with anyone around the world near-instantly at near-zero cost. Like texting and cloud computing, blockchain networks represent an undeniable upgrade in accessibility, scalability, resilience, and security.  Darkening this great promise, however, is the shadow of partisan politics.  Crypto has become a significant campaign issue in the 2024 elections. In an age when everything from arugula to fertility treatments and EVs has become politicized, it’s no surprise to see red-blue gaps emerging on crypto.  What is a surprise, though, is the degree to which industry figures themselves have exacerbated the problem. Their frustrations with Washington are understandable. Between arbitrary regulation by enforcement and an array of hostile policy actions, they may be forgiven for feeling under siege.  But let’s take a step back: almost all innovative industries must contend with a steep learning curve and initial skepticism. It can be tempting to respond with a rage-against-the-machine mindset, which is psychologically satisfying but deeply counterproductive. Frankly, some of the self-caricatures we’ve seen from industry influencers represent a degree of political malpractice unseen since the infamous “I’m not a witch” ad from 2010.  A grudge is not a strategy  Like charity, branding and messaging begins at home. It’s time for the crypto industry to reject the us vs. them mentality and embrace a bipartisan approach.  This isn’t just a pragmatic tactical pivot. It’s really an alignment with a convenient truth: developing a strong digital assets regulatory framework is in the national interest and should be inherently bipartisan.  Politicians as different as Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and former President Trump have come around to this view in recent years. After initially spurning the industry, Trump gave a pro-crypto keynote speech at this summer’s Bitcoin Conference in Nashville. In his remarks, Trump likened Bitcoin to “the steel industry of a hundred years ago” and said that “If crypto is going to define the future, I want it to be mined, minted, and made in the USA.” Last week, he even bought a burger with crypto at Pubkey, a “Bitcoin bar” in NYC.  Schumer, for his part, made the case for crypto legislation to bolster American innovation at a Crypto4Harris event last month. “Passing legislation this year is absolutely possible, even in these divided times,” Schumer said. “We all believe in the future of crypto,” he added, saying he wanted to bring members on both sides of the aisle together “so we can pass sensible legislation that helps the United States maintain its status as the most innovative country in the world.”  Just this week, Vice President Kamala Harris added her own support for crypto, linking its importance to American competitiveness. ""We will encourage innovative technologies like AI and digital assets while protecting consumers and investors,” she said. “We will create a safe business environment with consistent and transparent rules of the road.""  In part, this evolution reflects crypto’s sizable voting bloc, now estimated at 52 million Americans. More importantly, it represents the resonance of crypto’s promise with important priorities in each party.  For Democrats, crypto represents a vital departure from the costly fees and exclusive nature of traditional finance. It’s one of the most powerful tools we have to promote financial inclusion and economic mobility.  For Republicans, crypto represents a critical tool to preserve privacy and extend free enterprise globally.  For both parties, crypto means future-proofing the dollar, encoding democratic values into the future of finance, and protecting American technology competitiveness.  This fall’s post-election lame duck session in Congress holds the promise of not only delivering legislation, but also cementing crypto as a key policy agenda item for the next administration. It’s a good sign that other major financial hubs in Europe and APAC are moving forward with digital asset regulation. But, Americans shouldn't settle for allowing other jurisdictions to set the rules for the issuance of digital U.S. dollars. Democrats and Republicans alike should want to protect the integrity of the U.S. dollar and put regulations in place to protect our own currency and position as the leading global currency.  From Dodd-Frank in 2010 to the Communications Decency Act of 1996, Congress has a proud history of passing consequential, durable legislation on strategically important areas like financial markets and the internet with strong bipartisan majorities. Narrow margins undermine confidence and set the stage for future back-tracking. That’s why the crypto industry should be engaging with every member in both parties to make the case for standards to bolster American leadership and American values.  The next few months represent a historic opportunity to level up this industry with bipartisan legislation. Getting an American outcome requires a purple mindset. With the right positioning, this industry can be as American as Detroit carmakers, Silicon Valley tech, and apple pie – putting our values and our interests at the center of the next era of global financial infrastructure.

Siemens issued €100,000 worth of crypto securities under the German Electronic Securities Act (eWpG) on September 13, then redeemed it three days later. The payments were conducted on the Onyx network using the JPM Coin System, while asset transfers were settled on the SWIAT network's delivery-versus-payment (DvP) mechanism.  The whole process took 93 seconds from the confirmation of the trade by the parties on SWIAT to final confirmation of settlement sent to the parties that asset and payment transfers were completed. DekaBank also participated, acting as a regulated crypto securities registrar on the SWIAT network.  The transaction marked the start of Onyx and SWIAT collaborating to develop asset issuance products on blockchain rails for commercial banks. Their goal is to shorten value chains, increase transaction flexibility and speeds, and ultimately make financial transactions via blockchain rails scalable for commercial banks, the companies said.

Some analysts believe that XRP is on the verge of breaking out from a massive 4-year bullish triangle pattern, which has served as an extended accumulation period. Related Reading: Bitcoin Indicator Signals ‘Shift To Bullish Territory’ – Can BTC Break Past $65,000? This technical formation has been steadily building up, and now XRP appears poised for a significant expansion phase. Following years of underperformance caused by the ongoing SEC lawsuit and broader economic uncertainty, the market is watching closely for a potential breakout. If XRP breaks through its current resistance levels, many expect a parabolic rally, potentially leading to new highs. Investors eagerly await confirmation of this move, viewing it as a crucial moment in XRP’s long-term market trajectory. As momentum builds, XRP’s next moves could define its performance in the coming months and its role in the broader crypto market. XRP Price Action Suggests A Bullish Breakout The entire crypto market has experienced a surge, with Bitcoin and many altcoins seeing double-digit percentage increases in price. This rally follows the Federal Reserve’s recent decision to cut interest rates by 50 bps, sparking optimism among investors who believe a new crypto bull run is on the horizon. XRP investors also feel optimistic, as analysts share promising insights suggesting positive performance in this cycle. Related Reading: Ripple Whales Accumulate Over 380 Million XRP in Just 10 Days: Is A Breakout Near? One prominent crypto analyst, Carl Runfelt, shared his technical analysis on X, highlighting the bullish triangle pattern that XRP has been forming since 2020. According to Runfelt, XRP could see explosive growth during this bull cycle, potentially going parabolic and rising by over 200% within weeks if the pattern breaks. The key level to watch is $0.60, which has acted as significant resistance in recent weeks. If XRP breaks above this critical price point, it could trigger a wave of “fear of missing out” (FOMO), driving substantial demand and pushing prices to new highs. Investors are closely watching this level, anticipating a breakout that could reshape XRP’s trajectory for the remainder of the cycle. Pivotal Liquidity Levels XRP is currently trading at $0.587, sitting at a crucial level that could ignite a massive rally for the altcoin. After surging 15% since early September, the price is testing the weekly 200 moving average (MA) at $0.609 as resistance, a level that has held XRP down since April. Breaking through this barrier is essential for bulls aiming to extend the rally. XRP has reclaimed the weekly 200 exponential moving average (EMA) at $0.52, a strong demand zone since early July. This level will be key in holding up the price if a correction occurs. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Dogecoin Will Surge 1,000% Past ATH – Price Targets Revealed For XRP to continue up, the price must break the $0.60 level and reclaim the 1W 200 MA as support. A clean break above these levels would signal the potential for a larger rally and a shift in market sentiment. However, failure to close above current levels could lead to more sideways consolidation or even a deeper pullback. In that scenario, XRP may retest the weekly 200 EMA at $0.52, which could work as a critical support level.

The news comes as as Celestia's native token, TIA, is down 54% since the beginning of 2024, according to CoinMarketCap. Celestia had one of the hottest airdrops of 2023, issuing TIA to 580,000 of its users.  The fresh round of capital means that the foundation has a total of $155 million in funds, and saw participation from Syncracy Capital, 1kx, Robot Ventures, Placeholder. The team did not detail what the new capital will be used for but highlighted that core developers are focused on its new roadmap unveiled earlier this month.  “When Celestia launched last year as the first modular data availability layer, it scaled blockspace from the dial-up era to the broadband era,” said Mustafa Al-Bassam, co-founder of Celestia, in a blog post shared with CoinDesk. “Now, the core developers have introduced the technical roadmap to scale blockspace to the fiber optic era – while keeping it verifiable and low latency.”  Celestia is part of a growing field of modular blockchains, aimed to solve scalability issues with features that enhance the speed or execution of transactions. It is also a provider of data availability, which is pitched as a cheaper alternative to storing data on layer-1 blockchains like Ethereum.

However, crypto pundit Dan Gambardello, a popular analyst on the Crypto Capital Venture’s YouTube channel, predicts a potential bullish reversal based on an analysis of the weekly and daily charts. Key Technical Indicators Support Bullish Outlook According to the analyst in a recent video, ADA is poised for a significant breakout, potentially reaching around $31, representing a remarkable 8,500% increase from current levels. The analyst highlighted that the market has experienced “180 days of downside” since March, creating favorable conditions for this anticipated surge. Related Reading: Bitcoin ‘Final Cycle Pump’ Puts Price As High As $200,000 He further suggested that ADA could break its current cycle of lower highs and lower lows, citing key technical indicators, particularly the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) on the weekly chart, which is showing signs of a bullish crossover. “The macro momentum of Cardano is signaling its readiness to bottom,” he said, emphasizing the upward momentum of the MACD histogram since May. However, he cautioned that ADA has yet to decisively move above the 20-day and 50-day moving averages. He warned that while testing key levels, the move could fail, advising patience until more price action confirms a true breakout. While some analysts view Dan Gamberdello projections as overly optimistic, crypto analyst Sssebi has offered a more conservative forecast. He forecasts a rally of 20x to 30x for Cardano over the next year. Sssebi noted that Cardano current position mirrors its state during the last cycle, indicating a major rally may be imminent. He predicts that Cardano could hit a minimum price of $5 by 2025, with a possible peak of $10 during the height of the bull market. Cautious Outlook For Cardano However, not all analysts are as bullish. Trader “Lingrid” has adopted a more cautious perspective regarding Cardano (ADA), predicting a short-term pullback for the cryptocurrency. In a recent post, he noted that “ADAUSDT appears bearish on the daily timeframe,” forecasting a potential decline to $0.325 and suggesting that ADA may remain within the consolidation zone between $0.30 and $0.34 for an extended period. Related Reading: ‘Uptober’ Is Just Around The Corner: Here’s Where Bitcoin Price Is Headed This negative outlook is further reinforced by the bearish on-chain metric. According to Coinglass, ADA’s Long/Short ratio currently stands at 0.926, indicating a prevailing bearish sentiment among traders. Furthermore, its future open interest has declined by 3.8% in the last 24 hours and has been steadily falling. This suggests that traders are either liquidating their positions or hesitant to establish new ones. At press time, ADA was trading near the $0.352 level and had experienced a modest price decline of 0.8% in the last 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume had dropped by 18%, indicating lower participation from traders amid selling pressure.

The pilot, conducted in June and July, was an initiative focused on leveraging distributed ledger technology (DLT) applications to support market connectivity across the collateral management lifecycle to enhance mobility, liquidity and transactional efficiency of tokenized assets. Tokenized assets are digital representations of real-world assets, such as stocks, bonds or commodities, that exist on a blockchain. By enabling faster, more secure transactions and streamlined management processes, such assets could offer improved liquidity, transparency and efficiency. In the case of the UST Collateral Network Pilot, it proved the feasibility of more complex real-world transactions, including the creation of a digital twin of USTs, utilizing the tokenized UST assets in real-time to satisfy margin calls, completing asset recalls, and evidencing secured party control over the assets in closeout scenarios. The pilot involved blockchain solutions provider Digital Asset, four investors, four banks, two central counterparties, three custodians/collateral agents, and a central securities depository. Together they operated 14 so-called Canton nodes, connecting four types of cross-application transactions through ten distributed applications, leveraging The Depository Trust & Clearing Corp.'s LedgerScan solution to support dynamic tracking and governance of the assets involved in the pilot transactions. Participants successfully executed 100 transactions, demonstrating tokenized collateral assets' strong functionality and potential. This pilot builds on the successful Canton Network Pilot completed in December, which established the foundation for composable applications across a global economic network. The results come as a number of traditional financial heavyweights, such as JPMorgan Chase ( JPM ), Charles Schwab ( SCHW ) and Fidelity Investments, have shown growing interest in the blockchain space. In 2021, for instance, HSBC ( HSBC ) and IBM ( IBM ) successfully tested an advanced token and digital wallet settlement capability with direct transactions between two central bank digital currencies in a hybrid cloud environment.

33904330,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=643979,1727105440,"Bitcoin To Outshine Gold By 400% By 2025, Veteran Analyst Predicts","Veteran analyst Peter Brandt is making a bold prediction that is creating a lot of talk in the crypto arena: by 2025, Bitcoin should see its price jump 400% relative to gold. Related Reading: Solana Jumps 10% As Fed Eases Rates, Analysts Eye Even Higher Gains He feels that, according to the market patterns witnessed so far, Bitcoin could soar to the equivalent of around 123 ounces of gold. This rally potential comes in the wake of general price predictions, as Bitcoin is likely to increase by 65% over the next three months and by almost 100% in six months, data from CoinCheckup shows. Over the next year, an increase of 130% is estimated, meaning that confidence in the upward movement of Bitcoin is quite strong. There has never been a better moment for investors to ponder this question: Will Bitcoin be able to rise above the iconic status of gold as the prime store of value? Never mind if the crypto market cannot resist their bold prophesying; the confluence of key factors appears to portend a triumph for Bitcoin in the years ahead over gold. When I look at chart of Bitcoin/Gold ratio, here is how I view it: $GC_G $BTC $BTCXAU 1. Continuation inverted H&S pattern, neckline at 32.5 to 1 2. Left shoulder low at 14.2 to 1 3. Right shoulder forming flag 4. Could decline into high teens to 1 5. Target 123 to 1 pic.twitter.com/VKvsDqwkuU — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) September 21, 2024 Institutional Adoption Fuels Optimism A significant reason why Bitcoin is likely to rocket soon is because of the increasing institutional investment. Large financial companies, even governments, have begun to view Bitcoin as a store of value akin to old inflation hedges like gold. Such institutional support will be crucial in propelling Bitcoins’ price even higher as capital continues to pour into the market in more considerable volumes. But perhaps most significantly, decentralized finance has unlocked new use cases for Bitcoin beyond its role as a store of value. By including the underlying cryptocurrencies in the DeFi ecosystem, investors can use their Bitcoin positions in ways gold simply cannot be used. According to Titan of Crypto, another respected voice in the crypto community, Bitcoin’s unique position within DeFi will only strengthen its value proposition against traditional assets like gold. Gold’s Rise Could Boost Bitcoin Interestingly, the forecasted rise in gold prices could indirectly benefit Bitcoin. As gold registers fresh all-time highs, it reinforces the narrative of precious metals as a hedge against economic turmoils. This, however, makes Bitcoin a more functional option considering its digital nature and increasing utility within decentralized finance. Investors looking to diversify may see Bitcoin as a way to gain exposure to both safe-haven assets and the rapidly evolving digital economy. According to Wall Street investment banks, gold is likely to break through $2,700 as 2025 progresses, thanks to the expected rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. If Bitcoin maintains its current trend, its price compared to gold may rise, maybe reaching the 123-ounce threshold.

Those who own Bitcoin would see significant rewards if the alpha coin’s price rose 400% in relation to the popular yellow metal. Investors must exercise caution when considering this opportunity, despite the fact that Bitcoin’s long-term outlook remains optimistic, particularly in light of its projected 132% price increase within the next year. Overall, the crypto landscape is evolving rapidly, and Bitcoin’s role as a store of value could very well surpass gold’s in the coming years. Investors would do well to keep an eye on both assets as economic conditions shift and markets react to global developments.

33904977,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=644146,1727105409,PrimeXBT: Can September’s Historical Trends Shape the Current Crypto Market Performance?,"By Matthew Hayward, Senior Market Analyst at PrimeXBT Historically, Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market tend to experience a downturn in the month of September. This month has typically led to bearish price action movements, with both Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies seeing consistent negative returns. However, this September has been unusually eventful, with heightened price activity driven by shifts in the macroeconomic landscape and signals from central banks regarding potential policy adjustments. These factors have created a “perfect storm” of volatility within risk assets, particularly in cryptocurrencies. As seen from the past decade of data, September consistently ranks as the worst month for trading Bitcoin. Source: Crypto.ro Bitcoins Seasonality and the Crypto Cycle Theory Traditionally Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market have closely followed the “cycle theory,” particularly aligning with Bitcoin’s four-year halving cycle. So, how does this cycle relate to the current market performance? Following the most recent halving event, we have seen months of consolidation, with prices fluctuating within a range and market sentiment remaining predominantly bearish. This sentiment has directly influenced current market behaviour, keeping prices stable and reflecting the cautious outlook of traders and investors during this phase of the cycle. Source: Tradingview, Bitcoin Mathematics Uncertainty in the Macro-Landscape The macroeconomic landscape is becoming increasingly dynamic, marked by heightened uncertainty around central bank policies, something we haven’t seen in years. This uncertainty raises critical questions: will we face a recession, or will the economy continue to grow? With central banks navigating challenging economic conditions, the market is anticipating potential shifts in policy. This environment, combined with September’s historical tendency for consolidation and lower price movements, sets the stage for increased trading volume and volatility. As we approach key monetary policy decisions, especially with the U.S. elections on the horizon, we can expect an extended period of heightened volatility in the cryptocurrency market. Source: Reuters Big move from the FED and their Interest Rate decision This month we have already seen the Federal Reserve surprise markets by implementing a 50 basis point rate cut, lowering the interest rate from 5.5% to 5%. This unexpected move has caught the attention of market participants, signalling a shift in monetary policy that could have effects on the broader economy and financial markets. You can observe below how after this rate cut decision, we have already started to see the total crypto market as a whole shift to the upside. Almost a 10% increase since the announcement. TOTAL CRYPTOCURRENCY MARKET CAP: Bitcoins price action during this period of uncertainty Despite September’s reputation as a historically weak month for Bitcoin, there are already signs of a potential breakout by the end of the month. Current price movements suggest a shift in market sentiment, hinting at the possibility of continued upward momentum. This outlook aligns with Bitcoin’s halving cycle, which tends to precede bullish phases. Many experts believe we are approaching this critical phase, with favourable market conditions and long-term cyclical trends likely to drive a surge in Bitcoin’s price in the near future. BITCOIN (BTC/USD): Other notable moves in the Cryptocurrency space Following the release of favourable monetary policy data for risk assets, some interesting trends have emerged in the altcoin market. Solana, in particular, appears to be leading the way, showing the most volume and momentum. Its price is up nearly 25% for the month, challenging the belief that September is typically a poor-performing month for cryptocurrencies. This surge suggests that market dynamics may be shifting, with certain altcoins going against traditional patterns and benefiting from improved economic conditions. There have been other notable movements, particularly from Ethereum (ETH). Despite the recent launch of the ETH ETF, there has been a somewhat delayed response in terms of increased volume and volatility in the pair, unlike the immediate surge seen after the Bitcoin ETF launch. However, Ethereum seems to be staging a comeback, with its price now trading above the $2,500 mark and showing signs of further short-term gains. It will be interesting to see if the ETH ETF ultimately has a positive impact on price action as market conditions evolve.

42407574,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZQbrE,1727103080,The Fed Must Have Confident Consumers,"The Federal Reserve can’t let consumer confidence crumble.  I still remember the 2007-2008 financial crisis like it was yesterday. Leading up to the event, I read and listened to stories every day about the capital markets seizing up. Individuals were defaulting on home loans left and right. Bank balance sheets were ballooning with assets that were plummeting in value.  However, the mainstream media wasn’t running with the story as it first unfolded. So, the public wasn’t concerned. I can remember having a conversation with my in-laws about the topic over dinner. They couldn’t believe what I was discussing. Since they hadn’t seen or heard much about it on the television or radio, it wasn’t on the front of their minds.  Within a year, the stories were everywhere. As the carnage built, consumers panicked. You see, most people have the bulk of their net worth tied up in the value of their homes. As that started to fall apart, consumer confidence plummeted. Americans felt their net worth declining and started to pull back on spending.  The officials who currently serve at the Fed all lived through this. Some, like Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, were very involved in the bailout process. Others have helped to bring stability back to the financial system.  And most of them have served in their current positions through the COVID pandemic. They know what type of havoc the loss of consumer confidence can wreak on the economy. So, the last thing they want to do is see that happen again. That’s why the Fed just embarked on the current rate cut cycle and is likely to keep loosening for some time to come. The change should underpin a steady rally in risk assets like cryptocurrencies.  But don’t take my word for it, let’s look at what the data’s telling us.  In the early 2000s, the domestic housing market was on fire. Interest rates were low, and it was easy to borrow. Banks, looking to boost profits, were more than happy to lend the money. They could package the loans into collateralized obligations and make a killing on the associated margins.  As values kept rising, homeowners saw opportunities to borrow more money. Their houses were like ATMs. Banks kept making the loans to fuel growth, reaching further down the credit food chain.  Yet, all this borrowing led to spending, causing the economy to heat up. Inflation rose from 1.1% in mid-2002 to 3.3% by late 2004. Our central bank had to act. Between July 2004 and the same month in 2006, it raised the effective federal funds rate from 1% to 5.25%. And suddenly, buying houses just wasn’t as attractive.  Individuals had become overly leveraged against the value of their homes. They had borrowed more money than they could ever pay back. As house prices started to fall, loan-to-value ratios shot up. Homeowners soon realized it was easier to hand the keys back to the bank than it would be to spend the rest of their lives paying off the debt.  And that’s when consumer confidence began to collapse. If we go back to the chart at the beginning, we can see that according to the University of Michigan’s gauge, consumer confidence peaked at the beginning of 2007 at 96.9. At the time, borrowing costs were still high and the housing bubble was just starting to pop.  But then as people saw their life savings crumble in value, consumer confidence collapsed. It didn’t bottom out until November of 2008 at 55.3. In the meantime, the economy had cratered. The Fed had been slow to recognize the shift. It didn’t enact its first rate cut until late in 2007, well after house prices started to fall.  Eventually, our central bank would cut interest rates all the way back to zero. It would be another five years before consumer confidence saw a meaningful rebound and seven years before the Fed could raise rates again.  Fast forward to the pandemic and we see a similar story play out. State and local governments asked people to stay home for their safety. Schools and malls were closed while businesses asked employees to work remotely. No one knew how long it would last or what might happen to their income. Consumer confidence crumbled.  As you’ll notice in the chart above, the University of Michigan gauge peaked in February 2020 at 101. But two months later, it had tumbled all the way down to 71. It wasn’t until a couple of years later, in 2022, when individuals felt they could better navigate the post-pandemic world, that the consumer confidence gauge bottomed out around 50.  This time, like last, our central bank didn’t react until the crisis unfolded. By April 2020, it had cut rates to zero and was expanding the size of its balance sheet to inject money into the financial system. The Fed wanted businesses and individuals to spend. It was trying to boost confidence.  So now, let’s look at what’s going on with consumer confidence today:  As you can see in the above chart, consumer confidence has been easing of late. Since peaking at 79 in March, it has dropped back to 66. Now this isn’t a cause for alarm, but it’s the most notable slide since the trough in June 2022. High interest rates are the probable cause. And the Fed has likely taken notice.  Living through a crisis is difficult to forget. The event typically involves some sort of life-changing difficulty for you or someone close to you. The event tends to shape the decisions you make, especially financially, going forward.  As I said at the start, most of the officials running our central bank were there during the pandemic and worked to rescue the financial system in the aftermath of the financial crisis. So, their thinking and actions on monetary policy are being shaped by these events.  As Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan recently said, the consumer isn’t broken, but if the Fed doesn’t get going on rate cuts, it’s going to be a problem. The central bank can see the same signals in the system too. Policymakers know they can’t afford to lose consumer confidence: it will crush the economy and will take a long time to recover. So, rather than wait until something breaks, it’s attempting to get ahead of the problem.  The shift will lead to a series of rate cuts moving forward. That should underpin stable economic growth, improved consumer confidence, and a steady rally in risk assets like bitcoin and ethereum.

To be clear, the FTX fraud and resulting bankruptcy was first and foremost the result of actions perpetrated by its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried (frequently referred to as SBF). But for the fraud to persist and grow to the scale it did, it required negligence-based fraud on behalf of its auditor, Prager Metis, which recently settled misconduct charges brought by the SEC, agreeing to pay $745,000.  These charges are good for the industry, good for investors, and should help deter similar actions by opportunistic accounting firms in the future.  Auditing standards require at a minimum that auditors understand the entity and its environment, that it has the competency and independence to perform the audit, and that it can’t effectively staff the audit, among other things. These standards apply whether the audit client is a first-time client, a small local thrift shop, or a multibillion-dollar cryptocurrency exchange with a related party trading firm.  Prager Metis, which is based in New York, rushed into the latter space with abandon. The firm was the first to announce a metaverse headquarters in Decentraland. The firm took on FTX as a client. It apparently wanted to be seen as the accounting firm of the future. And yet, as the SEC has charged, it lacked the basic understanding and competency to audit the industry.  The blockchain and cryptocurrency industry has been plagued by frauds almost since its inception, even if fraud instances have seemed to contract from their 2018 levels. The industry itself is a high-risk industry requiring specialized knowledge and a deep knowledge of how traditional exchanges, blockchains, and investment strategies work together. Prager Metis seemingly lacked that fundamental knowledge. It didn’t understand the related party risk that FTX’s trading arm, Alameda Research, presented. And it didn’t do the due diligence to ensure that customers and investors were protected.  In situations like this, it’s always easy to play Monday morning quarterback and say this could have happened to any auditor and any client. But here, the failure was idiosyncratic. Prager Metis’ audit failed, and it failed because they didn’t mean the minimum standard for due professional care. And there were signs aplenty. FTX apparently kept its accounting record in Slack channels, personal messages, and QuickBooks. QuickBooks is a fine tool if you are a small business owner just starting out. It’s an unacceptable tool for a complex currency exchange worth billions and should have set off alarm bells for the auditor. Yet it didn’t. Maintaining records in Slack should have raised red flags. Yet it didn’t. The billions in cash transferred between FTX and Alameda should have raised red flags and led the auditor to investigate the relationship further. And yet it didn’t.  Read more: Francine McKenna - 'A Complete Failure of Corporate Controls': What Investors and Accountants Missed in FTX’s Audits  These aren’t complex misunderstandings in gray areas. They are clearly identifiable risks Prager Metis should have identified, responded to, and sought more evidence about to ensure the risk of a misstatement were lowered to a reasonable level. Prager Metis, as charged by the SEC, didn’t apply the appropriate level of skepticism to respond to the risks in large part because they seemed to lack the understanding or have the technical knowledge on crypto clients necessary to meet auditing standards.  The SEC’s actions should be warning signs to accounting firms regardless of their involvement in the cryptocurrency or blockchain industry. Just because there is a new and interesting field, like crypto, seeing huge inflows of cash doesn’t mean all accounting firms should jump in headfirst, even if there is new a market with new revenue streams waiting. Gaining an understanding of a new technology and industry takes time, research, and experience. If accounting firms don’t have the ability to upskill quickly, they would be wise to be late adopters to the industry and not first movers.  The actions by the SEC also show investors that regulators are still doing their job even when the gatekeepers fail to do theirs. They are still holding firms accountable when they fail to follow generally accepted auditing standards. They are still imposing fines and imposing independent quality control procedures even as the industry is preparing for more enhanced quality management standards in the coming years. And they are still watching over the watchdogs, the independent auditors.  Current and future auditors of crypto exchanges and blockchain businesses and platforms are clearly on notice from the SEC: know your industry and your client, or stay out. The standards are merely the minimum requirement. With new industries and clients, auditors need to go above and beyond to understand the risks the new industry and clients present. Reaching this standard won’t prevent bad actors from committing frauds. But it will greatly increase chances that the auditor correctly detects the fraud before investors are irreparably harmed – a task made significantly easier when the auditor has the competency and expertise to identify the risks early.  And, if a future auditor fails to heed the SEC’s warning, they too can expect swift and decisive penalties, sanctions, and actions.

42407569,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZQbhJ,1727100318,"Caroline Ellison Most Likely Won't Serve Time, Polymarket Traders Bet","This week in prediction markets:  Caroline Ellison most likely won't serve time in prison as part of plea deal, market suggests.  Will Qualcomm's bid for Intel succeed? Probably not.  Prediction markets were trendy at Token2049.  A little more than a week after FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was formally charged in December 2022, Caroline Ellison, his former lover, and CEO of Alameda Research, filed a plea deal asking for leniency in exchange for full cooperation with prosecutors.  Fast forward to earlier this month, and counsel for Ellison was before a U.S. court in Manhattan, arguing that she should get supervised release at most owing to her ""extraordinary cooperation with the government."" Her sentencing hearing is scheduled for Tuesday afternoon in New York.  Traders on Polymarket are betting the court will show mercy, with ""yes"" shares for ""no prison time"" trading at 48 cents, meaning the market sees a 48% chance she'll be released. Each share pays out $1 (in USDC, a cryptocurrency that trades 1:1 for dollars) if the prediction comes true, and nothing if it doesn't.  But there's also a slight possibility (20%) that Ellison gets 12 to 13 months.  Polymarket bettors have a mixed track record on guessing prison sentences.  While they correctly guessed that former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao would spend less than six months in prison (he was sentenced to four, much less than what the Department of Justice wanted), they were way off on Bankman-Fried's sentence, which came in at 25 years while the market was giving a 27% chance to 20-30 years, and a 28% chance to 40-50 years.  The intel on Qualcomm-Intel deal  The semiconductor industry was rocked this weekend, when news broke that Qualcomm had approached Intel about a possible takeover deal with analysts on the ground in Asia confirming that talks are taking place.  Polymarket bettors are only giving this a 13% chance of happening by Oct. 31.  From a purely financial perspective, Intel's shareholders would certainly welcome such a deal.  The beaten-down stock is worth the same as it was 20 years ago because Intel missed the artificial intelligence gold rush as its efforts to create a competitive AI chip by 2017 failed, its efforts to compete against the likes of TSMC and Samsung in the foundry (chip facotr) business are foundering, and it lacks a GPU product that's competitive with Nvidia for the ultra-high-margin data center industry.  Plus, Qualcomm's Snapdragon chips, which are based on ARM designs, are now in laptops and impressing reviewers with their performance while Intel's rivals are falling behind.  Regulators, on the other hand, are going to have a field day with this.  If there's one thing that Taiwan and China agree on, it's that Qualcomm acts as a monopoly in the mobile phone space, with regulators on both sides of the strait fining the company. Last week, the company lost an appeal in Europe to have a 2019 fine tossed which accused Qualcomm of predatory pricing.  Taiwanese trade publication Digitimes writes that Qualcomm's acquisition of Intel would face antitrust, and financing hurdles, and the company may be biting off more than it can chew – which is why Polymarket bettors are skeptical that the deal will go through.  In vogue  Two of the biggest names in crypto want to enter the prediction market space.  During last week's Token2049 event in Singapore, decentralized exchange (DEX) dYdX said it plans to launch perpetual futures on prediction markets, which dYdX Foundation CEO Charles d'Haussy explained in an interview with CoinDesk would offer decentralized finance (DeFi) ""a unique opportunity to regain attention.""  DYdX's upcoming entry into prediction markets is expected later this year as part of its major dYdX Unlimited upgrade. Expect more specifics, like the categories of markets, as the launch date gets closer.  Also at Token2049, Wintermute announced it's launching OutcomeMarket, a prediction market where outcomes are tradable as tokens listed on exchanges. Naturally, the first market launching is for the U.S. election, where users can punt TRUMP or HARRIS tokens.  The first exchanges to launch these tokens will be Bebop, WOO, and Backpack, but the exact date for the first day of trading isn't yet known.

33902122,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=643915,1727100011,Polygon (MATIC) To Come back From The Dead As Ascending Triangle Appears,"The Polygon (MATIC) price has suffered crash after crash in recent months, pushing it down to levels not seen since June 2022. This price crash has led to an 86.27% drop from it all-time high price of $2.92 recorded back in 2021. However, positive sentiment is slowly starting to creep up among Polygon investors who have struggled with losses for the better part of the year, especially as one crypto analyst has predicted a revival for the altcoin. Polygon On Its Way To A Revival Crypto analyst CobraVanguard has pointed out a bullish formation on the Polygon (MATIC) chart that could send the price flying from here. This formation known as the Ascending Triangle pattern has appeared at a time when investors seem to have given up hope on the altcoin. Related Reading: ‘Uptober’ Is Just Around The Corner: Here’s Where Bitcoin Price Is Headed According to the chart shared on TradingView, the Ascending Triangle began back in the month of August. Mainly, the formation was first picked up as the price crashed alongside the crypto market toward the end of the bearish month of August. This formation continued into the month of September as prices had begun to recover once more. Not only has the bullish Ascending Triangle formed on the Polygon chart, the crypto analyst points out that this is taking place inside of a Broadening Wedge pattern. This is important because a Broadening Wedge pattern is equally as bullish for the altcoin’s price. Naturally, when the Polygon price starts to recover inside the Broadening Wedge, it is expected to reach all the way to the top of the pattern. The first target for this bullish recovery is $0.4671, which is an increase of around 15% from here. The next target is $0.5442. Finally, as the Polygon price moves to completely fill in the Broadening Wedge, the crypto analyst expects the price to hit $0.6821. A breakout from here would no doubt be a welcome development for Polygon investors, 95% of whom are currently sitting in losses. According to data from IntoTheBlock, only 3% of wallets holding MATIC tokens are in profit, while 2% are sitting at breakeven. This makes it one of the worst altcoins in terms of profitability so far this year. MATIC Becomes POL Earlier in the month, on September 4, the Polygon network team carried a successful migration that converted MATIC tokens to POL. POL is purported to be a “hyper productive token” which is expected to help move the Polygon network forward. Related Reading: Tether (USDT) Surges With Massive Inflows, Closing In On Historic $120 Billion Market Cap Milestone Despite the anticipation that followed the migration, the POL (formerly MATIC) token has failed to move in a positive way. The price is only up around 5% from its $0.38 price at the time of the migration, showing that the migration had little effect on the price. However, expectations remain high for the altcoin as investors expect the fact that the POL token is now an altcoin with a whole new chart, and no much price history, to be one of the things that propels its recovery next.

42407573,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZQbuX,1727099560,Bitcoin Could Surge Thanks to Looser Financial Conditions,"The Chicago Fed's NFCI fell to -0.56, the loosest financial conditions since bitcoin's 2021 cycle high.  Financial conditions and bitcoin show a negative correlation suggesting the crypto thrives in risk-on environments.  Bitcoin has more than doubled in the last 12 months as financial conditions ease, signaling potential for further gains.  The Chicago Fed’s National Financial Conditions Index (NFCI) offers a weekly update on U.S. financial conditions across money markets, debt and equity markets, and the traditional and shadow banking systems. The NFCI is a valuable tool for assessing the health of financial markets, providing insights into liquidity, credit availability, and market risk. The index is structured so that a negative NFCI value indicates looser-than-average financial conditions, suggesting an environment where liquidity is more readily available. Conversely, a positive value indicates tighter-than-average conditions, where access to capital becomes more restrictive.  For the week ending Sept. 13, the NFCI registered at -0.56, indicating that financial conditions eased even further from the already looser than average level of the previous week. This level of financial ease hasn't been seen since November 2021, a period during which bitcoin {{BTC}} reached its 2021 cycle high of $69,000.  A noteworthy analysis on the relationship between the NFCI and bitcoin was recently shared by Fejau, host of the Forward Guidance Podcast. In an X thread, Fejau pointed out the negative correlation between the NFCI and bitcoin, arguing that looser financial conditions often act as a tailwind for risky assets. According to Fejau, when financial conditions loosen, easing increases, leading to a risk-on environment where speculative assets, including bitcoin, tend to rally.  Fejau’s analysis traces this negative correlation across several market cycles. In 2013, as financial conditions eased, bitcoin surged from around $100 in July to over $1,000 by November. This coincided with the NFCI index registering a low of around -0.80, indicating significantly looser than average financial conditions.  Similarly, in 2017-2018, the loosening of financial conditions coincided with bitcoin's dramatic rise from $2,000 to $20,000 in just six months at the end of 2017. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, financial conditions tightened significantly—the most restrictive since 2009—leading to a crash in both traditional risk assets and bitcoin.  Most recently, Fejau notes that as financial conditions have loosened over the past twelve months, bitcoin has once again surged, climbing from $25,000 to over $73,000 in March 2024 even before global central banks started to cut interest rates. Which shows financial conditions have been loose for the past twelve months.  This relationship is not entirely straightforward, with other factors like the DXY index (a measure of the U.S. dollar's strength) also influencing bitcoin's trajectory. A rising DXY tends to have negative implications for bitcoin, as a stronger dollar makes speculative assets less attractive.  As financial conditions continue to ease, the outlook for bitcoin and other speculative investments could remain positive, provided other economic factors remain supportive.

The company wants to expand into the EU and EEA by leveraging the Markets in Crypto Assets legislation.  Sygnum said it obtained a crypto license from Liechtenstein, paving the way for the Zurich and Singapore-based digital assets banking group to expand into the European Union under the bloc's Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA).  The bank's subsidiary in the country received a license allowing it to offer regulated digital assets services, including brokerage, custody and banking under Liechtenstein's Token and Trusted Technology Service Providers Act. That will enable Sygnum to apply for a crypto-asset service provider (CASP) license under MiCA after Liechtenstein adopts the regulation, planned for first-quarter 2025.  Sygnum joins companies like Coinbase, Circle and others preparing to expand in Europe as MiCA takes effect. MiCA is a bespoke set of rules for the crypto industry that enables companies licensed in one country to operate across all 27 member states as well as countries like Liechtenstein that are in the European Economic Area. Switzerland is a member of neither.  MiCA's stablecoin rules came into effect in June, with other regulations likely to come into force by December. EU countries have started accepting registrations for their respective crypto-asset service provider (CASP) regimes.  ""The registration as CASP in Liechtenstein paves the way for a significant expansion of our regulated footprint into the EU, the world’s largest trading bloc,” said Martin Burgherr, Sygnum's chief clients officer.

Bitcoin Performance Has Been Similar To Last Two Cycles So Far In a new post on X, analyst James Van Straten has discussed about the BTC price performance from the cycle low chart for the last couple of cycles. As its name suggests, this chart captures the price trend between successive cyclical lows. For the latest cycle, the start-point is naturally the bottom that was observed shortly following the collapse of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX back in late 2022. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hype Remains Low Even After $63,000 Surge: Green Sign For Rally? Below is the chart shared by Van Straten, which shows how this most recent cycle has stacked against the last two so far: As is visible, the asset’s recent price performance has been remarkably similar to that witnessed in the past two cycles at the same stage. “Out of all the graphs, TA etc, Bitcoin from the cycle low continues to be the most valid,” notes the analyst. Given the similarity so far, it’s possible that the coin’s trajectory in the current cycle may continue to mimic that of the last two. Van Straten has pointed out that both these cycles finished September higher. Not just that, this is also the point at which the two began a long-lasting surge that culminated into the bull run highs. Thus, it’s possible that Bitcoin may also surge from here, if the current cycle continues to follow the last two. “If BTC were to finish EOY between the two previous cycles, which it has done for most of the current cycle, we would be looking at 108k-155k,” explains the analyst. From the latest Bitcoin price, a rally to the lower end of this range, $108,000, would mean an increase of around 70%, while that to the $155,000 upper level would suggest growth of more than 144%. Related Reading: These Altcoins Are Seeing High Whale Interest After Fed Rate Cut As always with patterns that depend on history, though, it’s not necessary that BTC would show a rally in this range to end the year. Nonetheless, the analyst says, “if we don’t get a recession, this is entirely possible.” In some other news, as market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock has pointed out in an X post, Tether’s stablecoin, USDT, has reached a new high in its supply recently. As displayed in the above graph, the the USDT market cap has witnessed some sharp growth recently. With the metric’s value now nearly at $120 billion, Tether’s token has left the other stablecoins way behind. The inflows into the stablecoin can actually be relevant to Bitcoin, as capital from USDT generally tends to find its way into the original cryptocurrency. Thus, the growth to a new record suggests the investors potentially have more dry powder available to buy BTC with than ever before. BTC Price Bitcoin has gone stale after its recent recovery as its price is still trading around the $63,600 mark.

Latest Prices  CoinDesk 20 Index: 1992.83 +1.03% Bitcoin (BTC): $63,453.28 +1.27% Ether (ETH): $2,645.83 +2.62% S&P 500: 5,702.55 +0.19% Gold: $2,622.99 +0.1% Nikkei 225: 37,723.91 +1.53%  Top Stories  Major cryptocurrencies made cautious gains to start the week, with BTC around 1.3% higher over 24 hours at just under $63,500. Ether outperformed bitcoin, rising 2.7% to $2,650, while the broader digital asset market is up just under 1.1%, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index. Data from CoinGlass shows that in the last 12 hours, slightly more short positions than longs have been liquidated, with $64.23 million in short positions and $54.42 million in longs being liquidated. Trading is likely light in the aftermath of last week's 50 basis-point interest-rate cut in the U.S. BTC is up 9.5% in the past seven days while ETH is up over 16%.  Digital asset investment products experienced a second straight week of inflows, adding a net $321 million, according to CoinShares. The crypto asset manager attributes the performance to the 50 basis-point interest-rate cut by the Federal Reserve. Bitcoin-linked products led the inflows with $284 million, while their ether equivalents saw outflows of $29 million. This was the fifth consecutive week that ETH products registered outflows, even as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value led gains after the Fed's rate cut. ""This is due to persistent outflows from the incumbent Grayscale Trust and scant inflows from the newly issued ETFs,"" CoinShares wrote.  Core Scientific is on the cusp of becoming a major force in AI hosting, broker Canaccord has said in a report. Canaccord started coverage of the crypto mining company with a buy rating and a $16 price target. The shares were 1.4% higher at $12.15 in early trading. Canaccord identified three positive drivers for the stock: ""Ramping revenue in AI hosting, better cash flow and potentially more site acquisitions on the way,"" analysts led by Joseph Vafi wrote.The company also has potential upside from mining. It still has about 230 megawatts (MW) of power that can be used for bitcoin mining, even after repurposing almost 500MW for AI hosting, the report noted.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows notional open interest, or the dollar value locked, in the active solana call and put options trading on Deribit.  At $47.52 million, open interest in call options is 2.5 times bigger than puts, a sign of bullish positioning in the market.

Options trading on IBIT will unlock new pools of capital, allowing institutional investors to confidently engage in BTC exposure while mitigating downside risk. IBIT's dominance in the Bitcoin ETF landscape is set to accelerate, offering both spot market access and the flexibility of options trading. I discuss the reflexivity of gamma squeezes and how this now affects BTC's price on a rational expectations model. The approval of IBIT options cements BTC as a major asset. The SEC approved the listing and trading of American options on the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) on Friday, 20 September 2024. The OCC and CFTC still have to give their approvals, but SEC approval means the hard part is likely over. The listing of IBIT options would be a watershed moment for Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), potentially much larger than the approval of the spot ETFs in January. This article will analyze the consequences of this development, and expand on some Bitcoin options strategies which are now available to most US-based investors. Background It was basically impossible for US investors to access BTC options of any decent quality. The premier BTC options venue has always been Deribit, an options exchange based in Panama. Deribit supported 24/7/365 trading of BTC and ETH options, along with some perpetual futures products on major crypto assets. Options were European style, and settled in the physical underlying cryptocurrency. Deribit users had access to portfolio margin and leverage, similar to the capital efficiency afforded by SPAN margin in traditional financial markets (read: something you would expect from Interactive Brokers). Being crypto only, Deribit users could not cross margin with assets in a traditional portfolio like ETFs and stocks. Deribit is restricted to US persons. US investors have access to LedgerX, a crypto options exchange regulated by the CFTC. LedgerX is quite limited in its functions. First, the bid ask spreads on LedgerX are enormous. Second, there was no margin whatsoever. While Deribit users could trade naked options, every call on LedgerX had to be sold covered (owning the underlying BTC) and every put had to be sold cash secured (owning the cash value of the strike price). The other possibility for US investors was to trade options on BTC futures. For instance, /BTC and /MBT are BTC futures which trade on the CME. Both products have their own options on futures products. These options could be cross margined with the rest of a portfolio, but they also suffered from very wide bid ask spreads. The regulatory fees for options on futures also tended to be much higher. The final possibility for US investors was to trade options on BTC-adjacent assets. MicroStrategy options were probably used as a substitute. Another possibility was BITO options. The issue, however, was that both MSTR and BITO suffered from significant tracking error from BTC, even though the day-to-day correlation was very high. The lack of a truly agreeable venue for BTC options has arguably stifled BTC adoption over the years. Most reputable assets have deep options markets. SPY, QQQ, and IWM all have daily expiries and dominate the entire market in option volume. There are also SPX and XSP index options which are extremely liquid. A step-down from the major US equity indices and their ETFs are options on HYG, SLV, GLD, and TLT. These also boast extremely high options volumes. For a full list of volume breakdowns amongst ETFs, you can check out this tracker . On the stock side, every member of the Magnificent 7 has very deep options markets. The point is that having liquid options is an undeniable sign of an asset’s credibility. To put things into perspective, BTC’s market cap is about the size of silver’s. Yet, the US markets do not offer any BTC options chains that are remotely similar to SLV’s options. The approval of IBIT options is therefore a tremendous stamp of credibility, elevating BTC to a very prominent seat amongst all assets. Impact 1: Liquidity From Options Dealers The first material impact is that options create more liquidity in the underlying asset as options dealers (i.e., market makers) engage in dynamic hedging strategies. When options are traded, dealers frequently hedge their exposure by buying or selling the underlying asset—in this case, BTC or shares of the IBIT ETF. This continual buying and selling from options dealers provides a steady stream of transactions, smoothing out price volatility and increasing overall liquidity in the market. The resulting liquidity not only benefits traders looking for tighter spreads and deeper order books but also helps stabilize the market, especially during periods of high demand or heightened volatility. One impact of this liquidity increase is that it allows larger pools of capital to enter the market while incurring less slippage. Impact 2: Tactical Hedging Unlocks More Liquidity The availability of IBIT options will unlock new pools of capital that previously hesitated to enter the BTC market due to risk management concerns. Institutional investors, particularly those managing large portfolios, often require sophisticated tools to hedge their positions before committing substantial capital. With the ability to employ tactical hedging strategies via IBIT options, these investors can more confidently engage in BTC exposure while mitigating downside risk. This capability lowers the perceived risk barrier, allowing more capital to flow into the market. As these new entrants use IBIT options to hedge and protect their investments, the cumulative effect will be a significant boost in liquidity, further solidifying BTC’s place in global asset allocation. I want to really highlight how important this point is. You see, many institutional investors run massive portfolios with very high and specific demands regarding risk management, buying power, leverage. To date, many of them are still sidelined when it comes to BTC because the spot ETFs alone don’t cut it and real BTC definitely does not cut it. Options on a marginable security like IBIT is the perfect addition to bring the marginal sidelined investor into Bitcoin. First of all, many of these institutions can now hold a Bitcoin ETF and then use the buying power from their cumulative portfolio to set up tactical options hedges for the ETF position. Secondly, many institutions can choose to ignore the spot ETFs altogether but use IBIT options to structure very precise risk-defined payoffs based on the price action of BTC. Now recall impact 1— all of these derivatives volumes flow from option dealers, and many will touch the spot market to hedge out the options they are dealing. Thus, the increase in liquidity is coming from many different fronts, with some fronts being self-referencing and highly reflexive. Third, think of all the covered call funds we have nowadays which generate income while holding onto an asset. With the approval of IBIT options, funds can finally make something like QYLD, MSTY, TSLY, TLTW but for BTC. The covered call fund manager could hold IBIT and then sell IBIT calls at about 5% OTM each week or month. Given BTC’s enormous IV, this could lead to substantial income. This is yet another example of options directly opening a gateway to more liquidity because of the expanded list of things that can now be done via options. The last notable point here is that options are probably the most important derivatives because they can be used to construct all other positions. Want a forward contract? That is a long call and a short put, both at the same strike price and expiration. Want exposure to the magnitude of a move, irrespective of direction? That could be a straddle: long calls and puts at the same strike price with the same expiry. Altogether, options enable the creation of very complex structured products, and all of this is useful for getting more institutional capital involved in BTC. A very feasible example could be BTC backed loans. As a financial institution, I might offer BTC backed loans if I can find ways to efficiently hedge out the risk associated with BTC. This is the kind of job for structured products! And these are created often by purchasing specific baskets of options. Impact 3: IBIT’s Domination Will Only Accelerate As more investors flock to IBIT to take advantage of options, I think its dominance in the Bitcoin ETF landscape is set to dramatically accelerate. The ability to trade options will make IBIT an even more attractive vehicle for those seeking exposure to Bitcoin with a broader range of strategies at their disposal. By offering both spot market access and the flexibility of options trading, IBIT will stand out from other spot ETFs. At the simplest level, IBIT holders can now earn income via covered calls without tapping into any buying power. If you were to hold FBTC, then you could only sell IBIT calls by tapping into your buying power. This lowers your capital efficiency because it means you cannot use that buying power on other trades. Because IBIT is the first to have options be approved, it is likely that option trading volume on IBIT will remain “sticky” even as other spot ETFs get their options approved too. The resulting inflow of capital into IBIT will likely dwarf that of other competitors, reinforcing its dominance as the go-to Bitcoin ETF. There are some long term risks to this increase in IBIT dominance, but I will cover that in the risks section. Impact 4: Unprecedented Upside Market Reflexivity Thanks To BTC's Absolute Scarcity And Option Greek Dynamics This one is very complicated. I think the best way to ease into this topic is to talk about the GME short squeeze back in January 2021 and then talk about why squeezes fundamentally do not last for any asset. Finally, we will cover why BTC is uniquely different and how these options should affect BTC’s valuation going forward. What happened to GME back in January 2021 was not just a short squeeze. Perhaps a more important aspect of it was the use of weekly call options, which created a gamma squeeze. These have very short tenors (under 14 DTE), which means they have a huge amount of gamma. Gamma is the second derivative of an option’s price with respect to the price of the underlying. This is another way of saying that it is the first derivative of an option’s delta with respect to the price of the underlying. In short, gamma is the spot price-based convexity of any option contract. Gamma is one of the biggest reasons option dealers hedging is “dynamic.” As the price of the underlying asset moves, it is going to change the delta of the options via gamma. Gamma squeeze is the phenomenon where the purchase of short tenor OTM calls by directional traders can cause dealer delta and gamma to be heavily negative. To hedge out the risk, the dealers go out and purchase shares until they are delta neutral. The negative gamma, however, sits on the dealer books unless it can be offset by purchasing more options. When the price of GME rallied, perhaps due to the initial dynamics of the short squeeze, the OTM calls became closer to ATM. ATM options are actually where gamma is highest. So from the first phase of the GME rally, a lot of the negative gamma swelled to a much larger magnitude. At this point, every incremental increase in the spot price of GME forced much larger incremental changes to delta (remember, change of delta is determined by gamma). This forced dealers to buy more GME as many of the weekly options approached ATM. But this buying of course drove the price even higher, which caused more options that were even further OTM to approach their ATM price and hit their maximum gamma. Even as the calls became ITM, the dealer-driven buying does not stop. Gamma decreases as calls become further ITM, but it is still positive for long options, meaning that delta continues to increase. The drive to hedge out increasingly negative delta is what compels dealers to continue buying shares. This is a gamma squeeze, and it can happen when calls are purchased en masse by directional traders. To be clear, there is no orchestration by directional traders to trigger a gamma squeeze. It tends to happen organically when prices rally, potentially from a short squeeze, and traders want cheap short-term exposure to the upside, so they purchase calls that are expiring soon. Now, why don’t these squeezes last, and why do the names that get squeezed tend to crash back to pre-squeeze levels? The answer isn’t actually “fundamentals do not justify this higher price point.” Please remember that fundamentals do not justify most price points today, if we are basing things on the long-term average of PE multiples. The answer to all changes in price is always supply and demand. The sudden and parabolic rallies in price are nearly always caused by a sudden and parabolic increase in demand. When the price rises this high, it is a signal to all producers of the underlying asset to start producing more supply to meet this demand. This is what crushes the price. When shares undergo a gamma squeeze, the company issues more stock and sells it into the market. This is exactly what happened with GME, AMC, and the other meme stocks which soared in 2021. Even when commodities undergo dramatic price rallies, you can bet that producers of the commodity are now working overtime to meet the demand. When the Russian sanctions were put into place, natural gas rallied. Natural gas producers all over the world also began producing more natural gas, which obviously increased the supply and allowed the price of natural gas to fall back to pre-sanction levels. The chart shows exactly what happened. NG Futures (investing.com) The reality is every single commodity, equity, debt, currency goes through this dynamic. If the price is truly very attractive to producers or issuers, more supply will be created to meet the demand. There is only one major asset which deviates from this rule: Bitcoin. There are only 21 million BTC. This is a programmatic fact which cannot be changed without getting full nodes, miners, and users to all agree to change over to another code which governs the Bitcoin network. Such a consensus change is basically impossible. Bitcoin is therefore absolutely scarce. To tie this back to options, if a gamma squeeze happens for IBIT, there will be no elastic supply which can kick in to create more BTC. The only sellers will be folks who already own BTC and are willing to trade it for the higher dollar price. But this creates a major problem— it doesn’t really make as much sense for them to sell into the rally because everyone knows there will be no sudden creation of more BTC to meet this demand that pushes down the price. And this fact will color all decisions made with regards to the situation. I just want to be clear. I’m not saying no one will sell BTC. What I am saying is that when you compare a BTC holder and a GME holder, both in their own hypothetical gamma squeezes, one has a clearly larger incentive to sell because they know that more supply will be created which will drive the price lower. And this comparison holds for any asset holder versus a BTC holder. A silver or petroleum holder knows that more supply is coming, not from other holders, but from the miners and drillers which bring it out of the earth. So the possibility of a truly enormous and sudden gamma squeeze rally now exists if IBIT options are listed. Moreover, the possibility that this rally will outlive those of other assets also exists thanks to BTC’s absolute scarcity. This is now a factor which should be rationally priced into BTC’s valuation model. What is the new expected value of the price of BTC now that this is a possibility? Because the probabilities are positive, the extra boost in expected value must be positive as well. This constitutes a sustained increase under a rational expectations model for valuing BTC. Actionable Option Trades I think the biggest benefit to the retail investor is that they can now participate in BTC’s famous volatility. BTC has an annualized volatility of 50-100. This is many multiples of SPY or QQQ volatility. It is much more volatile than GLD or SLV, and certainly at times over 10x higher than TLT or HYG. The current best gauge of BTC IV, of course, comes from the current best venue for BTC options: Deribit. Here is the time series of BTC DVOL. BTC Vol Index (Deribit) DVOL is short for “Deribit Volatility.” The DVOL methodology is essentially identical to the VIX methodology. Both use options from two expiries closest to 30 DTE, throws out some illiquid contracts, and uses the variance swap formula to compute a model free implied volatility (meaning free from the Black-Scholes Model). Compare this to the VIX which has a current reading under 17, and normally around 12. Bitcoin options in the form of IBIT options give US investors access to the world of BTC’s IV. If done correctly, this could yield significant returns. The simplest trade would be cash secured puts or naked puts. Basically, just sell a put in the 40-25 delta range. The long-term bias on BTC is up, so the put is like a way of getting paid to buy a possible future dip. If BTC continues higher, then you get to keep the whole premium. You can also be more aggressive with puts and sell ATM. This will lead to larger premiums. I’ve never seen backtests of consistently selling ATM BTC puts, but the backtests of doing the same with SPX puts all look quite impressive. With IBIT puts, I imagine it would be more so thanks to BTC’s much higher IV. Personally I am considering combining a short OTM put with multiple long OTM calls. This will create a “boosted” futures position where the upside becomes more convex, approximating multiple 100 IBIT shares, while the downside collapses to a long position on just 100 IBIT shares. Because puts tend to trade at a higher IV to calls, it is sometimes possible to short a put and buy two calls without any debit. Risks There are a few risks which are worth mentioning. First of all, this all depends on BTC continuing to perform as an asset that is continuing to gain greater adoption and acceptance. A major collapse in the BTC price could render this thesis irrelevant. But this risk is effectively tautological. The tail risk I see with IBIT’s dominance increasing is that Coinbase as a custodian is becoming one of the biggest honeypots for hackers the world has ever encountered. Personally, I have been holding FBTC in my retirement account because Fidelity is custodying that BTC. Might I switch to IBIT so I can sell covered calls now? Maybe, but personally, I don’t have a big appetite for covered calls. I dislike that the options' approval is almost certainly going to increase the size of the Coinbase honeypot at a much faster pace now. Another tail risk I could see happening has to do with BTC trading 24/7/365 while IBIT and IBIT’s options will only be trading during traditional market hours. My concern is twofold. First, I would be very careful with holding short volatility positions on IBIT over weekends because there would be no way to close these on a Saturday when BTC does a 15% move in 6 hours. Technically, it doesn’t even have to be a weekend for there to be a major problem. Even overnight short volatility positions are highly risky because BTC can have a 15% move anytime between 1600 EST to 0930 EST and you’d have no ability to close your positions. Stop losses are good for normal options trading. When I traded SPY options, I had stops in place. But they were only effective because at no point was SPY trading when my options were not also trading. This is totally not the case with BTC and IBIT options. Second, I have some concern about options markets creating edge cases which could lead to random occurrences of high volatility in BTC and possibly coupled with IBIT experiencing NAV destruction. I’m not sure how this could play out exactly, but I imagine occurrences of very high IBIT gamma around Friday market closes could force dealers to have to hedge out their delta by buying real BTC over the weekend. Now, since IBIT is in-cash redemption, there could be some risk between transferring that real BTC to IBIT shares. All this risk will probably end up spilling into the market for BTC. We could randomly see bid ask spreads widen and orderbook depths thin out from major events. Conclusion Overall, I view the approval of IBIT options as a massively important moment in Bitcoin history. It further cements BTC as well as a major asset. It opens the gates to more liquidity. And it introduces a variety of interesting new possibilities for derivatives-savvy investors. I have long argued that the Bitcoin ETFs have not been as impactful as people make it out to be. Much of the inflow had to do with basis and pairs trades, and nothing to do with a bullish view on the asset. However, the introduction of options on the biggest spot ETF could dramatically alter this dynamic. As I have laid out here, the versatility of a liquid options chain invites bullishness in the classic reflexive nature of the market. Liquidity begets more liquidity and optionality begets liquidity that has been sitting in the sidelines— all of which begets more liquidity. And much of this liquidity will be here to stay now that they have the full tool set for fine-tuned and capital efficient hedging. BTC and IBIT are a Buy. The options are a watershed moment and we are still 14% below the all-time high and just starting on the rate cut cycle. The macro setup is absolutely fantastic .",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4722669-ibit-options-approval-massive-watershed-moment-for-bitcoin?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/33899292.jpeg

Despite this strong move, BTC remains just shy of the critical August 25th top at $65,200. This is significant because, if BTC does not breach this level, it will confirm a pattern we have seen since the all-time high of $73,666 in March, with Bitcoin failing to surpass any prior high before forming a new local bottom, maintaining a downtrend. In other words, zoom out, and BTC has been trending downwards since March. In addition, while near-term price gains have been positive, it is of some concern that BTC open interest has outpaced the price gains of BTC itself, indicating that it is the futures and perpetual markets, rather than the spot market that may have been behind much of the move last week. Meanwhile, we have seen some altcoins surging, with some notable coins posting more than 100 percent gains from their lows in August and September. However, similar caution is warranted here too, as altcoin OI has also reached a new high without the corresponding price breakout in the broader underlying altcoin market. The OTHERS index (which measures the performance of alts excluding the top 10 coins by market cap) has continued to trend downwards in the last month. With Bitcoin spot market buying slowing, evidenced by spot Cumulative Volume Delta flattening when the price reached $63,500, we foresee BTC moving in a range in the near-term. All that being said, a significant counter-argument to this thesis is that sustained ETF inflows could buoy the BTC price. In the last week, renewed inflows were recorded into spot Bitcoin ETFs, with $397.2 million added. This suggests that further upside is possible, particularly if traditional finance markets like the S&P 500 continue to rally. Should Bitcoin breach the key resistance levels from late August, this could propel the asset towards new highs, coinciding with the end of summer’s low liquidity. However, without sustained spot buying, consolidation or a partial correction seems the most likely scenario. In the broader economy, the Fed’s decision to cut interest rates by 50 basis points , is seen as the first in a series of reductions, and reflects a shift in the central bank’s priorities from controlling inflation to focusing on the labour market. Indeed, inflation is showing signs of softening as indicated by August retail sales data , which grew by only 0.1 percent, and was concentrated only in a limited number of categories. As employment stabilises and grows, household spending is expected to follow, but uncertainties linger over whether the current trajectory of consumer demand can be maintained. On the industrial front, the economy received a much-needed boost with a sharp rebound in industrial production in August. Similarly, the housing market experienced a boost in single-family home construction during August, signalling short-term optimism. Still, it remains unclear whether this momentum will be sustained. The Fed’s actions will be crucial in shaping how housing and broader markets adapt to these shifting conditions. The cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve rapidly, marked by significant institutional moves and regulatory crackdowns. In a major step for Bitcoin’s integration into traditional finance, the SEC has fast-tracked approval for BlackRock to list options for its iShares Bitcoin Trust on Nasdaq ISE, and further ETF issuers have also filed applications to list options. Meanwhile, MicroStrategy has expanded its already significant Bitcoin holdings with the acquisition of 7,420 more BTC for $458.2 million, bringing its total to 252,220 BTC, worth $15.8 billion. As these institutional advances are made, law enforcement efforts are also intensifying to remove bad actors. German authorities , including the Central Office for Combating Cybercrime and the Federal Criminal Police Office , have dismantled 47 exchange platforms allegedly used for large-scale money laundering.

Digital asset investment products experienced a second straight week of inflows, adding a net $321 million, according to crypto asset manager CoinShares.  CoinShares attributes the performance to the 50 basis-point interest-rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the first time the U.S. central bank has reduced the cost of borrowing in four years.

The $1.4 level is now in focus, as this cooling strength suggests that a pullback could be on the cards, offering a critical moment for SUI as it navigates through growing market pressure. Will the bulls hold their ground, or is a correction set to unfold? This article aims to analyze SUI’s recent price action in light of technical indicators, particularly the RSI, which suggests a potential cooling of momentum. By examining the implications of overbought conditions and the likelihood of a retest at the $1.4 level, this analysis seeks to provide insight into whether SUI’s bullish trend will continue or if a correction is on the horizon. Technical Indicators Point To Cooling Momentum: A Turning Point For SUI? Despite SUI’s price trading above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) on the 4-hour chart, the cryptocurrency is undergoing a noticeable pullback, aiming to retest the $1.4 level. This suggests that the recent bullish pressure may be slowing as traders reassess key support and resistance zones. An analysis of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index suggests a potential price drop toward $1.4 as the RSI line is dropping from the overbought zone toward the 50% threshold, indicating that SUI’s bullish momentum may be losing strength. Related Reading: SUI Climbs 36% Amid Bullish Breakout – Is $1.50 The Next Target? Also, on the daily chart, SUI is showing bearish sentiment as it attempts to retest the $1.4 mark. Since breaking above the 100-day SMA, the price has experienced a consistent upward trend without any significant pullbacks, indicating that a noticeable correction may be on the horizon. Finally, on the 1-day chart, a detailed analysis of the RSI signal line indicates that it has surpassed the 50% threshold and is currently at an impressive 82%. This high reading raises concerns about potential overbought conditions, which could trigger a market correction or pullback. $1.4 Retest Looms: What Traders Should Watch For Next As SUI approaches the critical $1.4 level, traders should be vigilant, as a breach below this point could indicate a potential move toward the $1.16 support level. If the price breaks below $1.16, it may signal a further decline toward the $0.8690 level and beyond. Related Reading: SUI Bulls Gear Up, Can They Push Through The $1.16 Ceiling? However, if SUI experiences a strong rebound at the $1.4 level, the price may start to rise again toward its all-time high of $2.18. A breakout above this level could indicate a continuation of the upward trend, possibly paving the way for a new all-time high. At the time of writing, SUI was trading at approximately $1.55, marking a 5.99% increase over the past 24 hours. The cryptocurrency’s market capitalization was around $4.1 billion, with trading volume exceeding $964 million, reflecting increases of 5.64% and 151.91%, respectively.

42390334,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bcUdxD,1727088036,Monero Nears Major Supply Zone at $180: Technical Analysis,"XMR has been locked in a range between $180 and $100 for more than two years  A breakout could potentially yield a strong rally.  Monero (XMR), the leading privacy-focused cryptocurrency, is rising toward a critical level that has repeatedly marked bull failure for over two years.  Since June 2022, XMR has been trading sideways, with multiple attempts to break above $180 leading to sharp pullbacks. The downside has been restricted to nearly $100, according to the charting platform TradingView.  The cryptocurrency's struggle to maintain bullish momentum beyond $180 suggests traders have been offloading their holdings when it nears that level. With XMR now changing hands near $175, traders should closely watch for a repeat of a bearish reversal lower or a potential breakout.  Markets accumulate energy during consolidation phases, which is released in the direction of the eventual bullish breakout or bearish breakdown. The longer the consolidation, the bigger the buildup and eventual release.  A sustained move above $180 would shift focus to resistance at $260, which is identified by adding the height ($80) of the two-year trading range to the breakout price of $180. This method of arriving at potential price objectives/resistance levels is known as the measured move/height method, according to technical analysis theory.  XMR crashed 35% to $100 in February after Binance, the leading cryptocurrency exchange, delisted the token, saying it didn't meet the exchange's standard.

Ether skyrockets 14%, with meme coins leading a 40% surge; bitcoin gains but loses market dominance.  Oil jumps 2% amid middle eastern tensions, gold rallies, and Nvidia and S&P 500 ride the risk-on wave.  On Sept. 18, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) made a pivotal decision that significantly impacted risk-on assets. The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 50 basis points, setting a new target range for the federal funds rate at 4.75% to 5.00%.  This move sparked debate, with some arguing that the Fed may have been late in the rate-cutting cycle, potentially signaling an impending recession. Historically, the last two times the Federal Reserve started with a 50 basis point rate cut were the 2001 and 2008 recessions, raising concerns that this current cut might signal similar economic challenges.  However, others suggest that the Federal Reserve may be navigating a ""Goldilocks"" period—where the economy grows sustainably. U.S. GDP growth for Q2 was a solid 3% on an annualized basis, and headline inflation has fallen to 2.5%, the lowest level since March 2021, reducing the need for real rates to remain this elevated (the real rate is the difference between the Fed's target rate and the inflation rate). Furthermore, the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow model predicts a Q3 GDP growth estimate of 2.9%, further supporting a balanced economic environment.  Impact on key macro assets  The development has been the significant rebound in the crypto market. Ether {{ETH}} surged nearly 14%, highlighting a resurgence of investor risk appetite. Within the cryptocurrency space, cat-themed meme coins have led the charge, emerging as some of the top performers with gains of 40% in just a week. Bitcoin {{BTC}} also saw a gain of over 5%, although its dominance in the crypto market dipped below 58%, signaling a broad-based rally across other digital assets.  Following the FOMC decision, several key macro assets have reacted positively. The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) rose by 0.36%, pushing the index back above 101, a level widely regarded as vital. Meanwhile, the USD/JPY exchange rate, which had dropped to around 141 just before the Fed's announcement, has since climbed to approximately 143.5. The weakening yen has further bolstered risk-on assets, including cryptocurrencies.  Crude oil prices have climbed over 2%, potentially influenced by ongoing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. Gold, a traditional safe haven, also saw gains. Additionally, Nvidia (NVDA) shares increased by just under 2%, while the S&P 500 index (SPX) rose by over 1%, indicating that risk-on asset classes broadly welcomed the Fed's decision.  Crypto ETFs see inflows  The buoyancy in the cryptocurrency market was further supported by inflows into both ether and bitcoin ETFs on Sept. 19 and 20. Ether-based ETFs recorded $8.1 million in inflows over these two days, while bitcoin ETFs saw much larger inflows of $250.3 million, according to Farside data.  Performance of market capitalization groups  When analyzing performance from a broader market perspective, it becomes clear that large, mid, and small-cap coins all faced underperformance in the lead-up to the FOMC decision.  However, coming out of the FOMC decision, small-cap cryptocurrencies have emerged as the biggest winners. Despite their early struggles, all three capitalization groups—large, mid, and small caps—have now made relative highs against bitcoin since the Fed's announcement, reflecting a general increase in risk-on sentiment and liquidity across financial markets.  Market capitalization groups are typically defined as follows: large-cap stocks have a market capitalization greater than $1 billion, mid-caps fall between $100 million and $1 billion, and small caps range from $50 million to $100 million.  Looking ahead, the CME Fed Funds futures are evenly split, with a 50/50 probability of either a 25 or 50 basis point rate cut at the upcoming Nov. 7 FOMC meeting, scheduled just two days after the U.S. presidential election.

With such a bullish outlook, there is the possibility that the flagship crypto can soon reach $70,000. Fed Rate Cuts Prompt Buying Spree Among Bitcoin Whales The Fed rate cuts have prompted a buying spree among Bitcoin whales. These investors bought over 1.6 billion worth of Bitcoin following the macro decision on September 18. Data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock shows that these whales have bought 25,510 BTC since September 19. Related Reading: Tether (USDT) Surges With Massive Inflows, Closing In On Historic $120 Billion Market Cap Milestone This accumulation trend is unsurprising, as the 50 bps interest cut has provided a bullish outlook for risk assets, including Bitcoin. The flagship crypto is expected to experience a significant price surge since more liquidity will flow into its ecosystem as investors can access more money following the Federal Reserve’s quantitative easing (QE). With Bitcoin projected to enjoy massive moves to the upside, a rise to $70,000 soon enough is possible. The flagship crypto already flipped the $60,000 price level as support following the Fed rate cuts and is holding comfortably above that level. As expected, more liquidity is already flowing into the BTC ecosystem, as is evident from the $1.6 billion purchase by these whales. Therefore, it shouldn’t be long enough before the crypto reaches the $70,000 price level. Bitcoin reaching this level is significant as it could pave the way for BTC to hit a new all-time high (ATH). The $70,000 price level has acted as strong resistance since the crypto dropped below this level after rising to its current ATH of $73,000 earlier in March. However, Bitcoin could easily break above this resistance this time, considering it has more bullish momentum thanks to the Fed rate cuts. History Could Repeat Itself In addition to the Fed rate cuts, Bitcoin’s historical trend provides a bullish outlook for the flagship crypto and suggests that a rise to $70,000 should happen soon enough. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently noted that Bitcoin enjoyed a 61% and 171% price increase in 2016 and 2020, respectively. These years were both halving years. Related Reading: Crypto Whales Buy $228 Million In XRP Following $5 Price Prediction The analyst further revealed that Bitcoin’s price action this year mirrors 2016 and 2020. As such, history could repeat itself, and the flagship crypto could enjoy gains similar to those in previous years. Moreover, Q4 of each year is historically when Bitcoin enjoys its most returns. Therefore, BTC should witness significant price gains heading into the last quarter of this year. Meanwhile, the post-halving rally is also around the corner, which could prompt this price surge to $70,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $63,900, up over 1% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

42390342,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bcUeMr,1727080981,"BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Options to Set Stage for GameStop-Like 'Gamma Squeeze' Rally, Bitwise Predicts","Options tied to BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF (IBIT) could set the stage for a GME-like gamma squeeze-led upside volatility in BTC.  Amberdata says over the long run, institutions' bias for yield-generating strategies could dampen volatility.  One of the exciting developments from last week was the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) nod for approval and listing of physically settled options tied to BlackRock's spot bitcoin {{BTC}} ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT).  There is consensus that the IBIT options, which still needs to be greenlighted by the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), will further help draw institutions to the crypto market. The crypto community, however, seems split on how it would affect the bitcoin market volatility.  Per Bitwise Asset Management, gamma squeeze, a rapid price rally catalyzed by options market dynamics, could become a feature of the bitcoin market following the debut of IBIT options.  Gamma squeeze  To understand the gamma squeeze, readers must know how options work. Options are derivatives that allow the buyer the right to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call option gives the right to buy and represents a bullish bet on the market, while a put option represents a bearish bet.  Options gamma is a metric that gauges how an option's delta, or the sensitivity of an option's price to movements in the underlying asset, changes for every $1 move in the underlying asset's price.  When investors buy a lot of call options, anticipating a price rally, market makers, who are mandated to maintain a net market-neutral exposure, end up on the other side of the trade, holding large amounts of short call positions, often called short gamma exposure. As such, they purchase the underlying asset as the market rallies because they are obligated to deliver the underlying asset to the call option buyer.  The hedging activity puts upward pressure on the spot price, causing a sharp rally, like the one in shares of American video game retailer GameStop (GME) in 2021.  Per Jeff Park, head of alpha strategies and portfolio manager at Bitwise Asset Management, IBIT options, offering regulated leverage on a supply-constrained BTC, will draw solid institutional demand for calls, setting the stage for a gamma squeeze.  ""Bitcoin options have negative vanna: as spot goes up, so does volatility, meaning delta increases even faster. When dealers [market makers] who are short gamma hedge this (gamma squeeze), bitcoin's case becomes explosively recursive. More upside leads to even more upside as dealers are forced to keep buying at higher prices. A negative vanna gamma squeeze acts like a refueling rocket,"" Park said on X.  Park explained that IBIT options will eliminate the ""jump-to-default (JTD) risk"" that has kept institutions at bay, allowing bitcoin synthetic notional exposure to grow exponentially. JTD refers to the risk of an issue or counterpart defaulting suddenly before the market can adjust for the increased risk.  He expects a strong investor bias for longer-duration out-of-the-money (higher strike) calls once the options go live.  ""With bitcoin options, investors can now make duration-based portfolio allocation bets, especially for long-term horizons. There's a good chance that owning long-dated OTM calls as premium spend will give investors more bang for their buck than a fully-collateralized position that could drop by 80% over the same period,"" Park said.  During an interview with CoinDesk, Bitwise Asset Management's head of research Europe, André Dragosch, voiced a similar opinion, saying, ""The consequence of this would be a price spike similar to what we have seen with GME, which is akin to a ""short squeeze"" in futures.""  Dragosch added that the upside volatility from the so-called gamma squeeze could be more pronounced due to the fact that bitcoin's supply is capped at 21 million BTC.  The other side of the story  Per Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at Amberdata, the gamma squeeze could be seen if a perfect bullish storm, characterized by Republican candidate Donald Trump's victory in the upcoming U.S. elections and Fed rate cuts, grips markets. However, over the long-run, increased institutional participation via the ETF and ETF options is likely to dampen volatility.  ""Institutional flows, in particular, are counter-cyclical. Portfolio managers tend to trim exposure through quarterly rebalancing, selling appreciating assets when bitcoin rallies too much,"" Magadini said in the weekly newsletter shared with CoinDesk.  Bitcoin's realized or historical volatility has been trending lower since the Chicago Mercantile Exchange listed bitcoin futures in December 2017, opening doors for traditional institutions to take exposure to the cryptocurrency.  Besides, institutional flows via IBIT options could temper Bitcoin's upside-implied or expected volatility, according to Magadini.  ""Another well-known effect of these flows is their impact on implied volatility. Institutions buy protective puts and sell covered calls, which dampens upside implied volatility,"" Magadini noted.  Implied volatility, or investors' expectations for the degree of price turbulence over a specific period, is influenced by demand for options. Upside implied volatility picks up when investors buy calls and vice versa.  Sophisticated investors use the covered call strategy to generate additional income on top of their ETF holdings, as observed in the gold market. The strategy involves selling a higher strike ETF call option and pocketing the premium (option's price) while holding a long position in the ETF. The short leg puts downward pressure on the implied volatility.  Crypto traders have been setting up covered calls through Deribit's bitcoin options, leading to lower implied volatility over the past few years.  ""As institutional ownership grows, their behavior has a greater impact. This means that, ultimately, institutional adoption leads to lower volatility in Bitcoin. This is merely a continuation of the clear structural decline in Bitcoin's volatility,"" Magadini summed up.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/09/23/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-options-to-set-stage-for-gamestop-like-gamma-squeeze-rally-bitwise-predicts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a1d4de23b4b4b604286f589f822cafe062b7570f-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

CBC News, Canada's public broadcaster, reported that the Bank ""is shelving"" the idea of a Canadian dollar.  Canada is shifting its focus away from a retail central bank digital currency after years of research, its central bank announced last week.  ""With this work completed, and with other payments issues gaining prominence, the Bank is scaling down its work on a retail central bank digital currency and shifting its focus to broader payments system research and policy development,"" a document vaguely titled ""Digital Canadian Dollar"" said.  CBC News, Canada's public broadcaster, reported that ""The Bank of Canada confirmed"" it has ""shifted its focus away from the idea of introducing a digital Canadian dollar."" The story also said the Bank ""is shelving"" the idea of a Canadian dollar.  It isn't clear whether the bank's official statement saying it was ""scaling down"" its retail CBDC work and ""shifting its focus to broader payments"" research means it has shelved the retail CBDC idea completely.  Particularly because the Bank also said it would ""continue to monitor global retail CBDC developments and publish some related research,"" there would ""be further opportunities for Canadians to provide input on a potential digital dollar,"" and that all the research done so far would be ""invaluable if, at some point in the future, Canadians ... decide they want or need a digital Canadian dollar.""  Canada's latest position comes as the debate over CBDC's became a presidential election issue in the U.S. despite the Federal Reserve's Chair, Jerome Powell, saying it was nowhere near recommending – or let alone adopting - a CBDC in any form"" and that ""people don't need to worry about it.""  But the Bank of Canada's update does come less than three months after a staff discussion paper which said that cash is ""likely to decline"" in relevance going forward then a ""properly designed CBDC would help fill the gap"" and maintain the relevance of a retail public money in the economy.""

Solana memecoin MOTHER, the brainchild of music star Iggy Azalea, is up 4% after having a strong presence at Breakpoint in Singapore.  Ether {{ETH}} pushed past bitcoin {{BTC}} in daily gains as Token 2049, and Solana's Breakpoint, two of the largest conferences in crypto, wrapped up in Singapore, but both of these tokens are relatively flat as the market stays stagnant.  ETH is up 2.6%, trading above $2,600, according to CoinDesk Indices data, while BTC is trading above $63,700, up 1.2%. The CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a measure of the performance of the largest digital assets, is flat, up less than 1%.  Data from CoinGlass shows that in the last 12 hours, slightly more short positions than longs have been liquidated, with $64.23 million in short positions and $54.42 million in longs being liquidated.  Trading is likely light in the aftermath of last week's 50 basis points (bps) interest rate cut. BTC is up 9.5% in the last week while ETH is up over 16%. Polymarket bettors are confident that another rate cut is coming but are split as to the extent: 47% say it will be 50 bps, while 47% say it will be 25 bps.  Solana's {{SOL}}, which was the focus of the Breakpoint conference that took place immediately after Token 2049, is flat, trading above $145. During Breakpoint, many attendees were impressed with the announcements coming from the protocol, such as Jump Crypto's validator going live.  Pendle, a portfolio company of Arthur Hayes' fund Maelstrom, is down over 6.5%. Traders are likely spooked that Maelstrom has reduced its position in the project after Hayes spent a considerable amount of time promoting it on stage in Singapore.  For his part, Hayes said that they reduced their position in Pendle to get liquidity to fund ""a special situation.""  ""Those who monitor our wallets will get a glimpse as to what that is in the very near future,"" he wrote on X.  Pendle is up over 24% on-week according to CoinGecko data.  Meanwhile, MOTHER, a memecoin promoted by music star Iggy Azalea is up 4.5% after she announced that the project was building a companion casino called Motherland.  MOTHER is one of the few celebrity memecoins that has managed to maintain its value.

According to the founder of DefianceCapital, Arthur, it means that the crypto has reached its end of the almost 900-day accumulation phase. There is a clear technical sign: the price has been forming higher highs and higher lows on the daily chart. Should the daily candle close above $153, some analysts believe that the asset can break toward the main level of resistance of $200. $AAVE is trading at the highest level since May 2022 and seems to be breaking out from a 2 year consolidation pattern.

His conclusions are consistent with the general consensus of the market which said that the coin was due for an enormous upsurge in its price. AAVE could rise 232% to $536 by October 2024. CoinCodex data reveals market momentum and technical alignment support this prognosis. $AAVE breaking out of almost a 900 day accumulation range Look for charts like this and load your bags pic.twitter.com/wbb4pe2gVK — TraderKoz (@TraderKoz) September 22, 2024 Rising Total Value Locked (TVL) The Total Value Locked (TVL) of AAVE rose nearly 100% from January 2024 with a present value at the time of writing of $12.181 billion. Any rise in TVL is indicative of growing interest by investors. This, most of the time, tends to have an upward price effect. DeFi is becoming alive again, AAVE’s rising TVL shows it’s reaping the benefits of this renewed enthusiasm. Figures from Santiment shows the total supply of AAVE now dominated by large holders is 55%. Such concentration may hint at a particular level of centralization but also symbolizes massive confidence from major investors. The whales have been consistently gathering the asset as a sign of belief in how well AAVE will perform going forward. Related Reading: Solana Jumps 10% As Fed Eases Rates, Analysts Eye Even Higher Gains Bullish Momentum Continues Further support for this bullish trend is the AAVE daily exponential moving averages (20, 50, 100, and 200), which implies a high momentum on price action. If this trend continues and breaches above the resistance level of $200, several analysts believe that it will leave a clear path toward $260 in the near term. AAave’s transaction volume is still trending upwards. Santiment data shows that the profit loss ratio stands at 4.472, where most of these trades are closing with a profit. So with these kinds of profitable trades on the rise, holders’ confidence only grew with big investors ramping up exposure to AAVE.
