14787353,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=542277,1689118179,Pre-100X Litecoin Signal Returns After Six-Year Slump,"Litecoin price is now back under $100, locked within an ever tightening trading range. The lack of notorious cryptocurrency market volatility in LTCUSD in recent weeks is reminiscent of late 2016 and early 2017 — right before an epic 100x rally. With the signal back, does this mean that another sizable surge is ahead? A Pre-100x Litecoin Signal Is Back Past performance is never a guarantee of future results, but technical analysis seeks out various signals and historical patterns in hopes of increasing the probability of success. What can be guaranteed, however, is that after a long period of low volatility, it ends with a bang and a breakout back into a highly volatile state. Combine this behavior with the more volatile crypto asset class, and you’ve got a recipe for some serious moves. So large in fact, that the lowest volatility that Litecoin ever reached, concluded with a breakout into a 100x rally. In less than a year’s time, LTCUSD grew from $3 to over $300. Now that signal is back again, and it could once again lead to a huge move in Litecoin. But it doesn’t necessarily mean up. It’s been a long time since bulls had a turn | LTCUSD on TradingView.com Why Low Volatility Ends With A Bang The pre-100x signal in LTCUSD we are talking about is the 9-day Bollinger Bands, and Bollinger Band Width. The Bollinger Bands are the second-tightest in Litecoin history. The Bollinger Bands are a volatility-measuring tool using a simple moving average and two bands set at two standard deviations. They expand with high volatility and contract with low volatility. A low volatility state, called a squeeze, always ends with a significant move and turn to shocking volatility. But volatility is only the measure of price dispersion over a time period. This means a that the large move, when it finally arrives, could be down. However, several other technicals support price appreciation in the future so up is also an option. What isn’t an option, is remaining in this low volatility state for much longer, so buckle up, it’s about to get interesting soon enough. Furthermore, Bollinger Band Width has been contracting with lower highs for six full years. If the downtrend pattern breaks, the largest movement in half a decade might arrive. #Litecoin volatility is compressing for six years now Lowest volatility since $LTC went from $3 to $300 (100x) in 2017 Patience will be rewarded. The longer it takes, the larger the move.

42393175,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgGov9,1689116773,Tokenized U.S. Treasurys Surpass $600M as Crypto Investors Capture TradFi Yield,"The market value of blockchain-based investment products that wrap U.S. Treasury bills, bonds and money market funds into a form of a token total $614 million, according to real-world asset data firm RWA.xyz’s compilation.  Demand for tokenized Treasurys among digital asset investors has been steadily growing as the yield on U.S. government bonds, widely considered as a risk-free interest rate, surpassed yields in decentralized finance (DeFi).  DeFi yields plummeted as demand for borrowing and leverage collapsed during the crypto market downturn. Meanwhile, bond yields in traditional finance (TradFi) rose significantly as the Federal Reserve Bank jacked up interest rates to the highest level since 2007 to combat rampant inflation.  This year, a slew of new entrants such as OpenEden, Ondo Finance and Maple Finance released blockchain-based Treasury products targeting sophisticated investors, digital asset firms and decentralized autonomous organizations.  “The entire macroeconomic backdrop has shifted,” Jack Chong, guest researcher at RWA.xyz, noted in a report. “This naturally attracts investors to shift their exposure from crypto assets into US Treasuries.”  Tokenization of real-world assets has become one of crypto’s hottest trends and could reach $5 trillion market value over the next five years, wealth management firm Bernstein said in a research last month.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | ONDO,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/11/tokenized-us-treasurys-surpass-600m-as-crypto-investors-capture-tradfi-yield,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8ede28587b4646866469a2d923edd26d04894a12-1948x1064.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
14786585,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=542215,1689116457,Bitcoin And NASDAQ Composite Index Correlation Drops To A 2-Year Low,"New data from Kaiko on July 11 indicates that the correlation between Bitcoin and the Nasdaq Composite Index is at a two-year low. The correlation coefficient between these two assets dropped to less than 1% in early July. At this level, it is at July 2021 lows. The NASDAQ Composite Index tracks the performance of all stocks listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange. Among stocks listed on this bourse include Coinbase’s COIN. Dropping Correlation Between Bitcoin And NASDAQ A correlation coefficient of around 0% signifies a weak negative relationship between Bitcoin and the NASDAQ. This implies that Bitcoin prices moved in the opposite direction or are unrelated to the NASDAQ Composite Index action. Related Reading: Bitcoin Google Search Interest Stands At Critical Level, What This Forecast For BTC As of July 10, Bitcoin prices were relatively firm, oscillating around the $30,000 level and generally in an uptrend looking at price performance in Q2 2023. For context, Bitcoin is less than $2,000 away from 2023 highs of $31,400 registered in June 2023. Meanwhile, market data shows that the NASDAQ Composite Index is also at multi-month highs and firm, reflecting the broader market recovery in the United States. The dwindling correlation between Bitcoin and the NASDAQ may be attributed to several factors. One potential explanation is that investors are becoming more discerning in their investment choices. As the cryptocurrency market matures and regulations are drafted, investors might seek assets with low correlation with traditional finance instruments like stocks and indices. The other reason could stem from the recent action of the cryptocurrency market. In 2022, cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, fell from highs registered in 2021. After peaking at over $69,000, Bitcoin prices crashed in 2022. This was fast-tracked by the solvency of several centralized finance platforms offering crypto services, including Celsius. The collapse of FTX, a popular cryptocurrency exchange, forced prices even low. In November 2022, BTC prices crashed below $16,000. Like crypto assets, technology stocks like COIN listed on NASDAQ are relatively volatile and were also impacted by rising interest rates in 2021. Subsequently, the dump in asset prices might have forced investors to be more risk-averse and diversify their holdings, forcing the correlation between NASDAQ and Bitcoin even lower. Watching The US Federal Reserve Whether this correlation will fall in the months ahead remains to be seen. However, at the moment, the cryptocurrency market seems fragile. Bitcoin bulls have failed to break above June 2023 highs in continuation of bullish pressure in the past few weeks. Related Reading: Bulls Remain Resilient Despite Litecoin’s Fall Below $100, Key Levels To Watch At the same time, market participants closely track how the United States Federal Reserve will proceed with its monetary policy. After steadily increasing interest rates to tame rising inflation, the central bank paused rate hikes in Q2 2023. Whether they will slash rates in the coming months remains to be seen.

A planned merger fell apart last year and it's seemingly been one hit after another for Sphere 3D. The company just had its best month as a BTC miner, but it's probably too little too late as the halving looms. The Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining industry had a tough 2022. Many companies were over-leveraged and blew themselves up when BTC fell below levels that made operations unsustainable. Sphere 3D ( ANY ) is a BTC mining company that once had lofty goals that, to this point, have failed somewhat spectacularly. Sphere 3 only recently got into crypto mining after previously operating as a data storage and management business. Bitcoin mining commenced in January 2022. NuMiner and Gryphon Setbacks Shortly after mining operations began, Sphere 3D announced an order of 60,000 mining rigs from a company called NuMiner Global. The rigs, called the NM440, would have reportedly generated an astounding level of efficiency that would have enabled a dramatic reduction in energy used to mine - thus, improving the gross margins for Sphere 3D. You can see a picture of the NM440 below: NM440 (NuMiner Global) But beyond the efficiency of the machines, when fully energized the amount of reported exahash capacity enabled by the NM440 would have given Sphere 3D a stunning 32 EH/s. This would have certainly made Sphere 3D the top public miner by monthly production and likely by a wide margin. Unfortunately, the NM440 never panned out for Sphere 3D. Skeptics at the time alleged the NM440 was nothing more than a photoshopped mockup of a Cerebras Systems CS-2 machine built for AI compute; sentiment Cerebras Systems seemed to corroborate according to Bitcoin.com . CS-2 (Cerebras Systems) During the same time, Sphere 3D was working on a merger with the private mining company Gryphon Digital Mining. Gryphon is led by Rob Chang who has previous public mining experience at Riot Platforms ( RIOT ). Chang was to be the CEO of the new company post-merger. The Gryphon deal subsequently fell apart shortly after the NuMiner situation with both Gryphon and Sphere 3D amicably agreeing to part ways in April 2022: After careful consideration by both management teams and their respective boards of directors, the parties amicably agreed to the termination due to changing market conditions, the passage of time, and the relative financial positions of the companies, among other factors. The day after the Gryphon deal ended, then Sphere 3D CEO Peter Tassiopoulos moved into a different consultant role with Sphere 3D and current CEO Patricia Trompeter took over. Things haven't gotten easier for Sphere 3D since the NuMiner/Gryphon situations as the company has dealt with all sorts of issues related to US customs shipping delays, deposits stuck in third party bankruptcy proceedings, and reliance on hosting services to bring rigs online. Finally, Sphere 3D recently sued Gryphon Digital Mining for what the company claims to be a breach of contract pertaining to fiduciary and operational obligations as part of a Master Services Agreement. Sphere 3D's new hosting arrangement is with Rebel Mining Company . Production is Actually Improving Despite the numerous issues pertaining to Sphere 3D's operations, the company has been able to bring more machines online this year. In May, the company mined nearly 78 BTC. While this is very small compared to other mining peers, it is more than double what the company was able to produce in the month of April and a 600% improvement over May 2022. At the end of May 2023, operating exahash per second reached 1.0 EH/s. It's the highest level of production Sphere 3D has attained but it should be noted that the company's January investor deck was guiding for 1.66 EH/s by April. Monthly BTC Production (Sphere 3D/Author Graphic) In January, Sphere 3D liquidated approximately 121.6 BTC when accounting for what was sold out of treasury and from January's production. Bitcoin's price in January was between $17-24k. Using a $20k BTC price as a baseline estimate, we can reasonably estimate Sphere 3D brought in about $2.4 million from liquidations in January - though the company may have actually been able to bring in more than that if it timed sales well. Path to Profitability? The biggest issue going forward for Sphere 3D is the company is running out of cash and scaling options are limited without debt or dilution. Quarterly revenue has averaged just $1.9 million over the last 4 quarters while opex has generally increased well ahead of what the company is bringing in. Data by YCharts When we factor in both opex and cost of revenue against just $7.7 million in TTM revenue, Sphere 3D's negative net income has totaled almost $182 million over the last 4 quarters: Data by YCharts A large factor in the Q4-22 negative net income was a result of impairment of intangible assets and investments related to vendor bankruptcies and the performance of FileCoin ( FIL-USD ). As of quarter ended March 2023, Sphere 3D had just $2.7 million remaining in cash and $74.9 million in total assets against 10.7 million in total liabilities. In the January investor deck , the company laid out some scenarios for where the quarterly revenue could be if it can achieve 1.66 EH/s in 2023: January Upside Estimate (Sphere 3D) Even if Sphere was able to achieve 1.66 EHS, which it has yet to do, Sphere's internal upside estimate may be overly optimistic. In the May Production update, Trompeter said this: By the end of June, we expect to be close to completing our near-term goal of 1.3 EH/s installed hash rate by energizing an additional 2,400+ miners that are currently in-transit and are expected to arrive at our hosting sites within the next few weeks. Once all 1.5 EH/s are fully operational in the month following, we expect to be delivering positive operating cash flows on a run-rate basis at current market levels. Bitcoin was closer to $25k when that press release came out but it's possible Trompeter was referring to end of May BTC levels which were closer to $27k. At the current $30k level, Sphere 3D could be cash flow positive next quarter but I have doubts about that. If we assume a BTC per EH/s figure of 80, which would be in line with what the company reported between April and May, I see a breakeven figure closer to $37k for Sphere 3D: 360 BTC @ $30,000 $32,500 $35,000 $37,500 Revenue $10,800,000 $11,700,000 $12,600,000 $13,500,000 Cost of Rev $8,550,000 $8,550,000 $8,550,000 $8,550,000 Opex $4,500,000 $4,500,000 $4,500,000 $4,500,000 Earnings -$2,250,000 -$1,350,000 -$450,000 $450,000 Source: Author Estimates My table above assumes production capacity of 1.5 EH/s averaged for the full quarter and opex remaining flat from Q1. This also assumes network hashrate remains constant which would be a counter-trend assumption. But to be clear, this is just my estimate and not necessarily indicative of the reality of Sphere 3D. Risks The next Bitcoin halving event is projected for April 2024. When this happens, the block reward for mining BTC will drop from roughly 6.2 BTC to 3.1 BTC. This means all miners will effectively see their cost of revenue double. While we saw transaction fees boost miner revenue in May, the Ordinals-driven trend in Bitcoin's fee market hasn't had follow throw into the summer months. Miner Transaction Fees (IntoTheBlock) Even though the company doesn't have debt, there has been dilution in recent quarters. Sphere 3D just finished a reverse-split to remain compliant with listing policies. And there was $8.5 million in stock-based compensation in 2022. Which means stock-based compensation exceeded revenue for the year. In my view, that's a red flag. Summary If everything goes right from here and Sphere 3D can scale production capacity goals without taking on debt, the company could theoretically get bought out by a bigger entity that wants to consolidate hashrate. But I don't know that I would bank on that given the macro uncertainty and the high cost of credit. ANY is an interesting hold, but I think there are better Bitcoin proxies in the mining sector. And I'll reiterate once again what I've said in many articles in the past; the best way to bet on Bitcoin is to just buy BTC.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | SPONSORED,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4616425-sphere-3d-a-crypto-winter-survivor?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/14785949.jpeg

42393183,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgGpPv,1689111360,Bitcoin Quiets Down in July After a Tumultuous First Half of 2023,"Bitcoin is trading unusually flat for July.  74% of Bitcoin addresses are in profit.  Wednesday CPI data is the next data point that markets will be watching.  The CoinDesk Bitcoin Trend Indicator continues to signal “significant uptrend.”  Bitcoin is trading unusually flat for July, a sign that investors are reluctant to chase the 21% price increase of the past month. Wednesday’s Consumer Price Index (CPI), the first, significant inflation data since mid June, may establish whether the range-bound trading pattern continues. A continued decline could buoy investors, while a flattening or increase could stifle them.  This year has been strong for bitcoin, with prices up 84% year to date. However, month-to-month data shows that much of the gains occurred during the winter, with January and March registering average daily returns of 1.11% and 0.73% respectively.  June performance was strong as well, with its 0.41% average daily gain largely driven by BlackRock’s spot ETF announcement. February and April were relatively flat, while May has been BTC’s only negative performing month this year.  Historically, July has been strong for bitcoin. Since 2014, BTC has risen an average 0.39% in July, third highest among all months. When measuring from 2020, July finishes second (to October), with a 0.57% average daily gain. Extrapolated over 30 trading days, the performance amounts to approximate monthly gains of 12% and 19%, respectively.  This has not been the case for 2023 however, as the average daily gain in July has been just 0.03%, approximately 0.93% higher if calculated over 30 days.  While bitcoin’s price has trended higher throughout 2023, the trajectory of daily gains by month has moved in the opposite direction. For all of the excitement around BTC’s rise, it's still a beginning-of-the-year phenomenon.  Pessimistic investors would likely consider the trend concerning for BTC prices. Optimistic ones would likely anchor to the fact that bitcoin has maintained its early year increase.  On-chain data from Glassnode indicates that 74% of bitcoin addresses are in profit, which likely scores one for the bulls. A high percentage of BTC holders in profit implies an investor base likely to hold its current position, especially following the sharp 2023 run-up.  A potential headwind exists in Wednesday’s CPI release, the first key inflationary data since the middle of June. Forecasts indicate that month-over-month prices increased 0.3%. A larger increase could potentially weigh on prices. Still, with markets already expecting the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to raise interest rates in July, it would likely take a huge increase to move prices significantly.  Finally, the CoinDesk Indices Bitcoin Trend Indicator continues to signal that BTC is in a significant uptrend, a sign that short-term prices are moving higher than long-term averages.

According to on-chain data, the stash is currently valued at over $3.76 million and has not transferred any funds to a cryptocurrency exchange for the first time. Vitalik Buterin Transfers The address has previously moved funds to Kraken, another cryptocurrency exchange. However, what’s evident is that the address, only identified as “0x9e92”, has been actively moving funds. Over the years, the address has received 22,300 ETH, approximately $41.6 million, from December 30, 2022, to May 18, 2023. Apart from today, the wallet only moved funds once 70 days ago when the whale transferred funds to Gemini. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hash Rate Retakes All-Time High As Miners Continue To Expand Capacity Whale and miner transfers to centralized cryptocurrency exchanges may be considered bearish. This is because users can readily convert crypto assets to fiat currencies like USD or stablecoins in these exchanges. As such, the more whales and miners transfer to centralized exchanges; the more retailers may choose to sell their coins, heaping more pressure on asset prices. Still, it has yet to be determined whether the address associated with Vitalik Buterin will sell. However, considering his past transfers, his deposit to OKX may not affect sentiment or adversely impact ETH prices. Ethereum Prices Choppy The recent deposit to OKX coincides with choppy price action across the cryptocurrency markets. Notably, major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, have been under pressure, with bears forcing prices lower over the past few months. In recent months, the overall value of the cryptocurrency market has decreased since the previous period of growth. During that time, the price of Ethereum surged to over $4,800 before plummeting to current levels. Related Reading: Tron Co-Founder Unstakes $56 Million From Ethereum Via Lido, Will ETH Prices Fall? When writing on July 11, Ethereum prices were choppy and moving horizontally below the $1,900 and $2,000 resistance levels. Although traders are bullish, their confidence has not translated to strength since ETH prices are moving inside a bull flag with support at around $1,800, evident in the daily chart. Meanwhile, decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) activities remain suppressed, impacting ETH demand. In Ethereum, ETH, the native currency, is used to pay for gas fees and others. Gas fees rise during heightened activity, which may lift ETH prices. In early May 2023, the Ethereum Foundation sold 15,000 ETH on Kraken, a cryptocurrency exchange. Their move coincided with a notable contraction of Ethereum prices in the first half of May. Therefore, whether the address associated with a potential Vitalik Buterin deposit to OKX might catalyze bears is yet to be seen.

42393179,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgGp5P,1689110292,Ether Staking Ratio Nears Key Milestone as Inflows Slow Amid Regulatory Pressures,"Ether (ETH) staking is nearing a key milestone of 20% of all tokens locked up in staking contracts, but inflows have slowed after an initial rush as investors grow cautious about regulatory risks.  Investors have deposited 23.9 million of ETH to Ethereum’s staking network, including tokens committed and waiting in a queue. The total accounts for roughly fifth of the token’s 120 million supply, a Dune Analytics dashboard by Hildobby shows.  Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade, which allowed withdrawals from its proof-of-stake network starting in April, unleashed fresh demand to stake the second largest cryptocurrency. Staking lets crypto owners lock up tokens to participate in securing the network as a validator in exchange for a reward, making it a popular investment among long-term investors including institutional investors.  Since the upgrade, deposits have far outpaced withdrawals by 4.5 million, worth $8.4 billion at the current price as investors rushed in, jacking up the waiting time to establish new validators to around one-and-a-half month.  However, the pace of inflows waned last month compared to the initial surge.  “The slowdown is likely to be driven by regulatory scrutiny on centralized exchanges,” Tom Wan, research analyst of digital asset investment product firm 21Shares, said in a note.  Early June was “a key turning point” for inflows, Wan noted, when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase. The agency alleged that the platforms, both among the largest ETH staking services, offered unregistered securities with their staking service.  Following the lawsuits, net flows into ETH staking plummeted for a period and turned negative on some days for the first time since early May, a Dune Analytics dashboard by 21Shares shows. Since then, flows returned to positive but at a lower level than in May.  Read more: Binance, Coinbase Endure $700M in Staked Ether Outflows as Decentralized Liquid Staking Protocols Gain  Validator queue eases  Slowing demand contributed to alleviating the pent-up queue to activate new validators to the network. The waiting time to deploy new validators decreased to 36 days from a peak of almost 46 days in early June.  Increasing the threshold of new validators entering the network per day also helped Ethereum work through the clog, dropping the queue by five days, Irina Timchenko, Ethereum blockchain manager at staking service Everstake, tweeted.  The still-elevated waiting time is detrimental for investors and “will definitely decrease flows” into staking, John “Omakase” Lo, managing partner of investment firm Recharge Capital, told CoinDesk.  The tokens transferred to staking do not earn rewards until they are stuck in the queue, lowering the effective annualized yield, he explained.  However, Katie Talati, head of research at digital asset investment firm Arca, said that the validator queue is less likely to affect inflows.  “Investors are more concerned with the unstaking queue, or how long it takes to remove money from ETH staking.”  Decentralized staking rising  Risks around centralized staking services have likely driven investors to decentralized solutions.  “We have seen a large amount of growth in staked assets with decentralized staking protocols such as Rocketpool and Lido,” Talati pointed out.  The two decentralized liquid staking protocols grew by 5.4% and 6.3%, respectively, through the past month, outpacing Coinbase and Binance.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | BNB,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/11/ether-staking-ratio-nears-key-milestone-as-inflows-slow-amid-regulatory-pressures,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5c0e45b0e8019f0a10516c816dcfd6ef7ef2e8c5-1736x882.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The hearing – the questions asked and the answers given – should provide some hints on how the case may go (for now, anyway).  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  COIN flip  The narrative  Coinbase and the Securities and Exchange Commission will meet in court this week. The hearing may give us a sense of how the judge is looking at the case in its earliest stages.  Why it matters  The case just began, and is likely to drag on for years if the parties don’t settle (see: SEC v. Ripple Labs, which is now halfway through its third year). Still, in the interest of reading tea leaves, the questions Judge Katherine Polk Faila asks and how attorneys for the SEC and Coinbase respond will indicate what issues may take prominence during the start of this legal battle.  Breaking it down  Coinbase and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will meet in court this Thursday for the first time in the federal regulator’s lawsuit against the crypto exchange.  To quickly recap: The SEC sued Coinbase in early June alleging that the cryptocurrency trading platform was simultaneously operating as a broker, an exchange and a clearinghouse for unregistered securities – namely, 13 different cryptocurrencies the SEC alleged met the requirements of the Howey Test, the 1940s precedent laid down by the U.S. Supreme Court.  Coinbase has telegraphed the SEC lawsuit for months, publishing a blog post when it first received a Wells Notice from the regulator and maintaining a legal effort to convince a court that there isn’t enough regulatory clarity right now for crypto industry participants to know whether or not they’re running afoul of federal securities laws.  The exchange continued that effort in its first formal response to the SEC last month, when Coinbase argued that the SEC was violating its due process rights and simultaneously trying to preempt Congress by bringing a lawsuit.  Coinbase also argued that the allegations shouldn’t even apply to its operations.  “Like all securities, an economic arrangement can qualify as an investment contract only if it involves an ongoing business enterprise whose management owes enforceable obligations to investors. Absent such obligations, the contract is just an asset sale,” Coinbase argued. “Because no such obligations are carried in the transactions over Coinbase’s secondary market exchange, and because the value that Coinbase purchasers receive through these transactions inheres in the things bought and traded rather than in the businesses that generated them, the transactions are not securities transactions.”  The SEC was not swayed by this argument. In its response to the answer, the SEC said “Coinbase attempts to construct its own test for what constitutes an investment contract.”  The filing took aim at other substantive parts of Coinbase’s arguments, including Coinbase’s at this point oft-repeated assertion that the SEC had a chance to weigh in on the exchange’s operations when it reviewed the company’s paperwork before it went public.  In the regulator’s view, the lawsuit is proper – and moreover, it pointed to Coinbase’s public disclosures that it might get sued as evidence that the exchange has already acknowledged the possibility.  The SEC was also unimpressed with some of Coinbase’s filings, calling one of them “improper” and asking the judge overseeing the case to ignore it for now.  The parties will meet in court this Thursday, at 10:00 a.m. ET, in a pre-motion hearing.

He said that the Security and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) recent enforcement actions against crypto companies, such as Coinbase and Binance, have been driving entrepreneurs out of the United States, which in turn has hurt the price of bitcoin.  But that doesn’t change how valuable bitcoin and its underlying technology are, according to Draper.  Read more: Bitcoin Could Rise to $120K by End-2024: Standard Chartered  ""It's a great system, it's great currency, it's a great way to operate,"" he said. ""I can't wait until I can raise a fund all in bitcoin, invest it all in bitcoin, have my portfolio companies all pay their employees and suppliers all in bitcoin and have taxes all paid in bitcoin, and have the waterfall all fall into people's bitcoin wallets. Because then there's no accounting, there's no auditing, there's no bookkeeping, it's all done on the blockchain. It's all honest and it's all straight.""  Draper was one of the early advocates of crypto. He realized the significance of bitcoin in 2013 following the notorious collapse of the Mt. Gox crypto exchange, he said in an interview in 2014, in which he noted that he had bought 30,000 bitcoin after the incident.  Since then, he’s been a big investor in the cryptocurrency and projects related to it, leading multiple funding rounds for startups in the space.  In 2018, Draper first made the bold prediction that bitcoin would hit $250,000 in June 2023 and he stuck with that prognostication even through the recent bear market, up until now.  “So much for my prediction abilities,” Draper tweeted on June 30, admitting that bitcoin had only reached $30,000 at the time. “I guess we have to wait a little longer, (maybe 2 years) but engineers are hard at work.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/07/11/tim-draper-still-thinks-bitcoin-can-reach-250k-just-2-years-later-than-he-expected,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2cda9e057b239c1b17013ecc889dcbb98694154a-1024x683.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The package known as v1.5 covers a range of new and updated features to how the Aptos blockchain works and what its builders can do with it. Aptos is among the newer so-called layer 1 blockchains that vie to support internet-based economies on decentralized infrastructure.  One change, AIP-21 would enhance the network’s capabilities when it comes to tokenized securities, real estate, in-game currencies and other fungible assets. Although Aptos already supported on-chain token issuance, its existing standards could not keep up with “creative innovations” like restrictions on who can own an asset, according to a proposal description.  Other changes are tailored toward backend services, like tracking the behavior of nodes, restoring nodes from cloud backups and filtering out duplicate transactions from blocks. One developer-focused proposal will help them build cryptographic applications in Move, the coding language of Aptos.  Staking rewards will fall 1.5% annually, a shift that would slightly limit payouts to token stakers who lend their assets to the network’s security.

Marathon Digital's costs to mine each Bitcoin are close to the current market price, limiting profit potential unless Bitcoin prices significantly increase. The company also faces the risk of not being able to roll over its debt in three years if Bitcoin prices fall, which could lead to bankruptcy. Introduction This is turning out to be a good year for Bitcoin (BTC-USD) enthusiasts. Most risk assets have done well as the Federal Reserve goes easy on interest rate increases, and provides support to banks, increasing liquidity in the market. As investors drive up the price of Bitcoin and associated stocks like MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) and Coinbase ( COIN ), Bitcoin miners are having their day in the sun. Although still far off their highs, their stocks have had an impressive run of late. The latest positive news has been BlackRock ( BLK ) filing to create a Bitcoin ETF . Marathon Digital ( MARA ), a debt-laden Bitcoin miner, seems to be the worst positioned of the Bitcoin bunch, with 75% downside to fair value. Company background Marathon was incorporated in 2010 and is based in Fort Lauderdale, FL. It operates 8 Bitcoin mining facilities in the US, and is planning one in Abu Dhabi, UAE (through a joint venture). It contracts with data hosting providers to host its equipment that run to secure transactions on the Bitcoin network, in return for which the company generates Bitcoin. The mining process involves performing a large number of mathematical computations to guess the result of a cryptographic process. Marathon Digital is listed on the Nasdaq exchange. It has a market cap of $2.5 billion and an enterprise value of $3 billion. Marathon Digital quarterly financial overview For the first quarter of 2023, Marathon Digital reported revenue of $51.1 million, down 1% versus the prior year. It reported cost of revenues of $51.1 million and G&A expenses of $15.3 million, for an adjusted operating loss of $15.3 million, or a -30% adjusted operating margin. The company also had $6.2 million in impairments and $17.6 million of realized gains, which I exclude in my analysis. Including these, the company reported an operating loss of $3.9 million. The share count at 159.2 million, was up a stunning 54% over the prior year. The company produced 2,195 Bitcoin during the quarter. It cost the company $23,280 (up 11% YoY) to produce each Bitcoin before G&A expenses, and an all-in cost of $30,250. So at current prices , the company should be just about breaking even. Cost of producing Bitcoin last quarter before G&A expenses = $51.1 million/2,195 Cost of producing Bitcoin including G&A expenses = ($51.1 million + 15.3 million)/2,195 Looking at the balance sheet, property and equipment was $715 million, up $442 million from the prior quarter, as the company took delivery of equipment it had previously ordered and paid for. The company had $125 million of cash and $733 million of debt. I would give the company credit for $146 million of investments and deposits, calculating net debt to be $462 million, The debt is 1% interest rate convertible debt due 2026. The conversion price is $76 per share, far from the current share price of $16. So it’s fair to say that it is unlikely to be converted, and the company has got a good deal at the expense of the debt holders. The company also owns 11,466 Bitcoin, which at the current price of $30,500, is worth $350 million. On the cash flow side, the company funded its operating deficit of $58 million by issuing $163 million of stock. The excess cash was used to repay $50 million of debt and invest $43 million in a joint venture to set up mining operations in Abu Dhabi. The problem for the crypto mining industry as a whole, is that with easy access to capital, all of them are expanding capacity and spending big on equipment. With increased competition and difficulty, the cost to mine each Bitcoin goes up. And there are only 1.6 million (of the 21 million maximum level set) left to mine! MARA stock valuation and recommendation Given that it costs the company about $30,000 to mine each Bitcoin, close to the current market price, I don’t believe there is much profit potential in this business. The company would generate profits if the price went much higher, but I would expect this to be temporary and the margin to be competed away. The clear contributor to value here is the Bitcoin held by the company as it is a liquid asset that can be easily monetized. I will be generous and assign value to the property and equipment as well at the carrying value. Most of it can be sold and repurposed, possibly for the trend du jour of AI. Adding these two elements gives us $1,065 million in value for the enterprise. To get the equity value, I will deduct net debt of $462 million to arrive at $603 million, or $3.80 per share. Thus, I see more than 75% downside from the current $17 share price. For a bull case, I will assume that the price of Bitcoin gets a boost to a sustained price of $36,000, and the company produces 1,000 Bitcoin a month at a cost of $30,000 each. This is the current level of production, according to an update the company provided for June. Thus, it would generate an operating profit of $6 million a month, or $72 million a year. I will assign a 12x multiple to this cash flow to get a value of $864 million. In addition, the Bitcoin the company holds would now be worth $63 million more. Adding these two elements to the base case valuation would result in equity value of $1,530 million or $9.60 per share. Thus, it is hard to get to even a $10 stock price on a fundamental level. For the nit-pickers, I will admit that there is an element of double-counting here, with the value of the property and equipment being added along with the cash flow value of the business. It provides a level of conservatism were Bitcoin to reach a higher level. In a bear case, the company will get to November 2026 with Bitcoin in a bear market. It is unlikely that the company will be able to get the kind of generous debt deal it (and to be fair, many other companies) got during the Covid bull market. The problem for Marathon is that with inconsistent revenues dependent on a volatile Bitcoin price, no profits, and assets that barely cover its debt if they can be sold, rolling over the debt at any terms may prove to be challenging. In this case, the company would have to declare bankruptcy, with the equity being rendered worthless. I recommend that investors sell any positions in MARA stock or short it. I see little fundamental risk in a short position, with big downside to fair value. I would caution that the short interest is moderately high at 25% of float . The stock is not easy to borrow, with a cost that will depend on what your broker will charge, in the 5 to 10% a year range. A lower risk option would be to buy puts, at the $15 strike, while a lower cost option would be to sell calls and roll them over as they expire. It is hard to identify definite catalysts, but an interest rate increase in July, followed by quantitative tightening as the Federal Reserve sells securities, could deflate the price of Bitcoin and related securities. In the case of Marathon, I would expect continued share sales from the company as well, particularly if the price of Bitcoin goes down below the cost of production. External ratings Seeking Alpha’s quantitative rating system gives MARA a composite rating of 3.4, equating to a hold, with a C- for valuation, C- for growth, F for profitability, and A+ for momentum. So if you’re a momentum investor, this article is not for you! Wall Street analysts have a buy , with a rating of 3.8. Their average price target appears to be $13, lower than the current market price, so they will need to either downgrade their ratings or increase their price targets to reflect the recent price action in the stock. Upside risks are moderate The main risk for any mid-cap company is acquisition risk. I think it’s unlikely that any unrelated company would want to get into the Bitcoin mining business and pay a premium for a miner. It is possible that a competitor like Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) may want to buy the company, but it is not much bigger. On a fundamental basis, the company could become much more profitable than I have forecast by cutting costs and/or seeing the price of Bitcoin balloon. Due to the higher than normal level of short interest, the chances of a short-covering rally are not insignificant. The company could pivot its business model and become an AI firm! Conclusion Bitcoin mining is highly capital intensive, with elevated costs and no margins. Even with generous assumptions, there is downside in MARA stock. The company faces the risk of not being able to roll over its debt in three years if the price of Bitcoin falls.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4616398-marathon-digital-big-downside-to-fair-value?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/14781999.jpeg

The partnership will launch a new non-fungible token (NFT) collection called “Forever CR7: The GOAT,” featuring 20 unique designs spread across four rarity levels. The collection will celebrate some of the most iconic moments from Ronaldo’s illustrious career, with each NFT representing a significant goal or milestone. Cristiano Ronaldo’s NFT Collection On Binance The “Forever CR7: The GOAT” collection is significant because it marks a major milestone in the convergence of sports and NFTs. The partnership between Binance and Ronaldo is expected to generate significant interest within the crypto and sports communities. Binance’s CEO, Changpeng Zhao, commented on the partnership, saying they are thrilled to partner with Ronaldo on this new NFT collection. Ronaldo is one of the greatest soccer players ever and a global icon with an enormous fan base. They believe the Forever CR7 collection will be a huge success and milestone in the sports and NFT industries. Related Reading: Crypto Update: Top 3 Altcoins To Watch This Week The growing trend of athletes monetizing their brands through digital collectibles is evident in the NFT collections released by other sports stars. For example, American football quarterback Tom Brady partnered with NFT platform Autograph to release a collection of digital collectibles in 2021, while basketball player JaVale McGee released a collection of NFTs called “Mint Condition” through the NFT marketplace, OpenSea. Other sports stars who released NFTs include soccer players Gerard Pique, Mesut Ozil, and boxer Tyson Fury. But there is a possibility of another battle between two of soccer’s greatest players, often considered the GOATs in the sport, but this time off the pitch. Will Lionel Messi enter the NFT marketplace and release his collection in collaboration with a major exchange like Binance to compete with Cristiano Ronaldo? Messi Vs. Ronaldo, Is An NFTs Showdown On The Horizon? Lionel Messi has already made his mark in the NFT world by releasing his latest collection in collaboration with Ethernal Labs. The collection features five digital collectibles commemorating Messi’s international career, and they are available for purchase using Ethernity’s native crypto token, ERN. In a statement, Messi expressed his excitement about his latest NFT collection and his partnership with Ethernal Labs: I am happy to kick off my next NFT collection in partnership with Ethernal Lab. I look forward to joining my fans in celebrating my career with my National Team with this NFT experience on the ethernity.io marketplace. There is a possibility that Messi may collaborate with a major exchange such as Binance or with a different company or project to expand his NFT venture further and compete with Ronaldo’s offerings. Such a collaboration would give Messi access to a broader market and allow him to reach a more extensive fan base. This prospect is even more interesting because Binance sponsors the Argentinian National soccer team. This link between the exchange and Messi’s home country could provide the perfect opportunity for the two parties to come together and create something extraordinary. Binance’s Argentinian National soccer team sponsorship could also provide a unique marketing opportunity for the exchange. By collaborating with Messi, Binance could tap into the massive fan base of the soccer star and reach a wider audience in Latin America and beyond. Messi’s popularity and success in the NFT space and Binance’s reputation and Argentinian National soccer team sponsorship make this collaboration a natural fit. The soccer star’s latest NFT collection with Ethernal Labs has already shown his potential to succeed in the NFT market, and a partnership with Binance or with a different project could take his NFT offerings to the next level. Messi To Launch NFTs With Planet Token? Another strong possibility is that Messi will launch an NFT on PLANET, a platform using blockchain technology to fight against climate change. Via his Instagram account, Messi could have hinted at the potential partnership. In a video shared with his followers, the football player stated, “I’m working on something.” As seen in the post, the video contains PLANET’s logo.

Ethereum is already home to tokenized real world assets like Gold and other security tokens. ERC-4337 allows for ""account abstraction"" on Ethereum. This would be a big departure from the poor UE currently facing crypto networks. We don't need custodians anymore. That's BlackRock ( BLK ) chairman and CEO Larry Fink from his recent appearance on Fox Business ( FOX ). Most of the attention from Fink's interview justifiably centered around Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and BlackRock's recent Bitcoin ETF application. There were a lot of really interesting comments from that appearance but one of the most important points Fink made pertained to the future of finance and transactions: We're a believer in digitization of products. ETFs was a big revolution for the mutual fund industry and its really taking over the mutual fund industry. We do believe that if we can create more tokenization of assets and securities , that's what bitcoin is, it could revolutionize again finance. Bold my emphasis. Pertaining to blockchain specifically, Fink said the following: I actually think the underlying technology is fantastic. The blockchain will help you accelerate the processes of transactions. The blockchain will help you identify. Let's be clear, if you have a pure blockchain and you have knowledge of who the buyers and sellers are, we don't need custodians anymore. The whole process of finance, some of the intermediaries are broken down. Taking these comments together, this interview was one of the more bullish crypto conversations I can recall seeing on a legacy media platform from a traditional finance giant. These are the kinds of things retail crypto investors have been saying for quite some time. But to have a person like Larry Fink now saying them is quite a big deal in my opinion. Tokenizing Assets Let's start by explaining what tokenization fundamentally is. To buy exposure to a commodity, currency, or equity today one needs to generally go through a third party brokerage firm to facilitate the transaction. For example, if I want to get exposure to Gold ( XAUUSD:CUR ), short of buying the metal directly from a dealer and holding it in physical form, I might also get non-physical exposure through a variety of different custodians. However, traditional finance typically adds a layer of risk to holding Gold as the user is putting trust in the broker in addition to the issuer and custodian. T+2 rules also become a factor as settlement of the transaction takes two days before ownership has actually been transferred. Gold vs Derivatives (Seeking Alpha) Gold is actually one of the few real world assets that has already been tokenized. For instance, Paxos Global has issued PAX Gold ( PAXG-USD ) - a crypto token that is backed by physical gold on a 1:1 basis held by Paxos Global. This token has traded in-line with SPDR Gold Shares ( GLD ) and Gold over the last 3 years. PAXG is an ERC-20 token and is available through any decentralized exchange, or DEX, on the Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) blockchain. This means someone who holds ETH in any self-custodial wallet can get tokenized gold exposure, in fractionalized form, simply by doing a DEX swap for PAXG directly on-chain. Like other Gold derivative products, PAXG is redeemable for physical. However, unlike other gold derivatives available in traditional brokerage accounts, because PAXG is traded on Ethereum, settlement is essentially instant. Crypto users could quite literally buy and sell products or services exclusively in Gold through the PAXG token on Ethereum. USDC Supply (CoinMarketCap) Another fairly obvious example of asset tokenization is through stablecoins. While the fiat-backed stablecoin market has seen outflow since the collapse of Terra Luna ( LUNC-USD ) last year, dollars and other fiat currencies have already been tokenized through blockchain rails. Equity Tokens What we have not yet seen is a successful push toward tokenization of company equity. However, there have been attempts to do so in the past. Through a platform called Mirror Protocol on the aforementioned Terra blockchain, synthetic versions of Apple ( AAPL ) and Tesla ( TSLA ) previously traded over blockchain. Synthetix ( SNX-USD ) and UMA ( UMA-USD ) are two other protocols that have focused on synthetic versions of real assets on-chain. Binance ( BNB-USD ) and FTX ( FTT-USD ) also had a footprint in equity tokenization attempts though those products lived within the walled gardens of those exchanges rather than on the open blockchain like PAXG. Where things get very interesting though is with the potential for the tokens themselves to become the proof of equity rather than derivatives of the equity. And there is no shortage of companies trying to build regulated platforms for ""security token"" equity raises. Overstock's ( OSTK ) tZERO platform, Securitize , and ERX are notable examples of centralized businesses that are aiming to build internal blockchains for security token offerings and trading. However, I suspect that the entities that do best in the security token market will be the ones that integrate with public blockchain rails rather than building their own walled garden ecosystem. And we're already seeing public chains used in some of these platforms. Ethereum: Security Token Winner? Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain and is still the largest public blockchain in the DeFi space by just about any metric. Ethereum Value (billions) Smart Chain Rank Native coin Market Cap $227.8 #1 DeFi Total Value Locked $26.3 #1 Stablecoin footprint $68.7 #1 Sources: DeFi Llama, CoinMarketCap There is an immense amount of value secured by Ethereum. As the largest smart contract chain by both native coin market cap and stable coin market cap, I believe Ethereum is well positioned as the leading network candidate for security token offerings as well. We're already seeing instances of security tokens that have been built or will be built utilizing Ethereum's smart contracts: Kinesis Mt Pelerin SOMA.Finance Beyond ERC-20 tokens, there are token standards within the Ethereum ecosystem that are designed specifically with security tokens in mind; ERC-1400 and ERC-3643 are two notable examples. Furthermore, ERC-4337 could sort of be looked at as the silver bullet for network adoption because it creates ""account abstraction."" According to Cointelegraph Magazine , this will allow for significant improvements to the user experience on the network. 4337 will allow for batched gas fees at the dApp level and private key recovery. Each of which address large pain points for the end user. Of Course, The Risks The biggest headwind facing Ethereum at the moment is a hostile US Securities and Exchange Commission. There is a very real possibility that Ethereum could be labeled an unregistered security by the SEC. Other leading smart contract networks have already suffered this fate including Solana ( SOL-USD ) and Cardano ( ADA-USD ). That said, Ethereum is a global network and other jurisdictions with much friendlier positions on crypto may be more welcoming to the technical innovation offered by public blockchain. However, if the SEC does come after Ethereum as well, it will almost certainly result in value destruction on Ethereum in some capacity. Whether that's through declines in the price of ETH, DeFi protocols moving to a different chain, or both. Main Takeaways There have been notable criticisms of the regulatory capture threat currently facing Ethereum. Others have pointed out that even leading DEX protocols like Uniswap ( UNI-USD ) could implement KYC/AML policies in the future. From where I sit, no public blockchain will ever be perfect and satisfying everyone is an impossibility. But the direction Ethereum seems to be going is one where traditional finance players will be able to safely and easily integrate with the network in a compliant way. Larry Fink sees the future with tokenization. From where I sit, there are already companies that are working on tokenizing real world assets on public blockchain networks. Given the amount of value the network is already securing, it's difficult for me to envision a private walled-garden blockchain beating out a borderless public blockchain like Ethereum. Ethereum may not satisfy everyone from a philosophical standpoint. But purely from an investment standpoint, I'm not betting against ETH.",POSITIVE,ETH | PAXG,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | FIAT | ICO | PAXG,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4616386-ethereum-equity-tokenization-is-coming?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/14780648.jpeg

42393178,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgGp0H,1689101038,"Arkham CEO Defends ‘DOX-to-Earn’ Program, Says Public Blockchains ‘Worst’ for Privacy","Crypto analytics platform Arkham is in the midst of a public-relations firestorm this week, with a vocal contingent of the crypto community expressing outrage on Twitter over a program unveiled Monday that incentivizes people to reveal the identities behind otherwise anonymous or pseudonymous blockchain addresses.  During a Twitter Spaces on Tuesday, Arkham CEO Miguel Morel batted back at critics, arguing that a lack of privacy is inherent to how most blockchains operate today.  “Publicly available blockchains are probably the worst possible way of keeping one's private information private,” Morel said on the space, which was hosted by Twitter personality Mario Nawfal. “You are literally making transactions which you are broadcasting to a decentralized network of millions of people, all of whom can look on-chain in order to see which transactions are being broadcast.”  Arkham’s program, which critics sarcastically termed, “DOX-to-Earn,” will allow anyone to set “bounties” – rewards for people who can uncover and share the identities behind a given crypto address.  Currently a free platform, Arkham markets the bounty program as a way for traders to gather financial data. The firm has also said that the bounties might be used to root out perpetrators behind crypto thefts and exploits.  Privacy and blockchains  Privacy is frequently cited as a core principle within the blockchain community, and privacy advocates like Edward Snowden have gone so far as to promote projects like Zcash that let users make anonymous financial transactions.  When Arkham announced its new bounty program and changed its tagline to, “Deanonymizing The Blockchain,” the company – perhaps purposely – ruffled some feathers.  In responding to the backlash, Morel pointed to the widely-held misperception that all blockchains are inherently private. Not only is this untrue, but – as the Arkham CEO points out – privacy is, in reality, a core weakness of blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum as they’re typically used today.  Unless people use a mixer program like Tornado Cash – the Ethereum-based transaction-anonymizing service that’s been blacklisted by the U.S. government – the wallet addresses associated with a crypto transaction can be viewed by anyone with an internet connection.  “Speed, ease of use, actually owning your own assets, being able to make cross-border payments instantly – these are all amazing reasons for using cryptocurrency,” said Morel. “Trying to be completely anonymous is not one, and this is something that, you know, many people do not understand.“  Making money off of information  Not everyone on Tuesday’s Twitter space was swayed by Morel’s blockchain privacy defense. A common criticism levied against Arkham on the Twitter space – and in the lead-up to it – was around how the platform would judge the accuracy or relevance of labels added to the platform. How would the platform prevent regular people from having their identities exposed? Especially troublesome would be misidentification.  Morel said Arkham would not allow all bounties or address labels onto its platform: “It’s not a completely free market. It’s not like anybody can, you know, post any piece of information.”  “The main customer of Arkham is traders. It's hedge funds. It's people making money off of information about who's buying and selling large positions of a particular token,” he said. “Nobody's going to be posting info about somebody's dog. Nobody cares, nor is it going to get approved.”  When asked to expand on the rules Arkham would use to guide its moderation decisions, Morel said: “We’re gonna explain everything and it’ll all be written out in the coming days.” He added that audience members can read Arkham’s whitepaper for initial details, and said his ultimate plan would be to “decentralize” bounty moderation decisions to a wider community.  Ran Neuner, a crypto commentator and TV host, was among the most critical participants in Arkham’s Twitter discussion. “My issue is not with the system. My issue is with your company managing the data,” he told the Arkham CEO.  Arkham, which has been live for less than a year, has already been at the center of multiple controversies.

Aave is a lending and borrowing platform which recently introduced its own native algorithmic stablecoin, gho. An stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value by utilizing algorithmic mechanisms. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, stablecoins aim to minimize price fluctuations and provide a stable store of value. In the case of gho, an algorithm determines its supply and demand ratio. Gho will be pegged to the US dollar and its supply will be managed by the Aave DAO as well as its interest and risk parameters. Userds mint gho by using assets they have supplied on to the protocol as collateral. Gho holders will then continue earning interest on their assets. The stablecoin has been on the Goerli testnet and has so far encountered no problems. In a governance post last June 6, Aave Companies released its proposal to deploy the stablecoin on Ethereum’s mainnet. With its deployment, Aave expects stablecoin borrowing on the Aave Protocol to become “more competitive and generate additional revenue for the Aave DAO by providing to the DAO treasury 100% of the interest payments made on GHO borrows.” Gho will be introduced via “facilitators”: the V3 Ethereum Pool Facilitator and the FlashMinter Facilitator. The former allows for gho lending against their collateral while the latter functions akin to a flash loan, which are loans not requiring any collateral. These facilitators can be other protocols or entities. Aave has recently launched its V3, which further optimized the yield generation and borrowing power of users’ assets. Apart from its plans to deploy gho to Ethereum, it is also eyeing the deployment of its V3 to Coinbase’s Base network. Aave has been the leading lending platform with over $5.6 billion in total value locked (TVL), per DefiLlama. The $5b is split between its V2 ($3.9 billion) and V3 ($1.95 billion).

This roll-up network is designed to be fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) programming environment. Roll-ups are also regarded as a crucial component of Ethereum’s development plan. Related Reading: Bulls Remain Resilient Despite Litecoin’s Fall Below $100, Key Levels To Watch Linea is being launched following a successful testnet phase, during which 5.5 million unique wallets performed over 46 million transactions in three months. According to ConsenSys, this achievement makes Linea one of the most active initiatives on Ethereum’s Goerli testnet. App developers can deploy their projects to Linea’s “alpha” network on Friday, and the general public will have access to it starting next week. Key Features Of Linea’s Alpha Mainnet Phase Linea has introduced several significant upgrades with the release of its alpha mainnet stage. This includes a new outer-proof system and a dynamic fee mechanism. Linea’s alpha mainnet stage includes a feature called batch conflation. This feature optimizes the number of layer-2 transactions and blocks that can fit into a layer-1 submitted batch. By doing so, Linea is able to reduce the fixed costs associated with layer 1 and provide a more cost-effective transaction experience. Ethereum was priced at $1,860 on the one-day chart | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView In addition to the lower transaction fees, the launch of Linea’s alpha mainnet stage is expected to reduce friction for developers and improve onboarding with fast finality, a capital-efficient bridge, and inherited Ethereum security. These upgrades will enable Linea to offer transaction costs that are substantially cheaper than Ethereum’s base layer. MetaMask To Include Linea Support As Well MetaMask, a wallet offered by Consensys, will also support Linea soon. It will allow users to access the network through MetaMask Portfolio and its Bridge, Swap, and Buy features. The integration is expected to be rolled out in the coming weeks and MetaMask users will be able to interact with Linea’s decentralized applications and protocols with ease.

42393181,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgGpKn,1689097379,EthCC and Crypto's Latent Biases,"As we prepare for the upcoming Ethereum Community Conference (EthCC) in Paris, France, I’m reminded of the anxieties that surrounded last year's DevCon in Bogota, Colombia. In the weeks leading up to the conference last year, Twitter was awash with advice about safety precautions. High-profile industry figures, including one of the founders of Polygon, decided to sit out the event citing safety concerns.  The stark contrast between how people speak about conferences held in regions like Latin America and those in North America or Western Europe is difficult to ignore. Make no doubt, it is a good thing the global Ethereum community organizes conferences all over the world. But far too often when major events like EthCC are set up in supposedly dangerous places, the industry’s latent racism comes out.  Azeem Khan is the head of impact at Gitcoin and an advisor to Foresight Ventures. Follow him on Twitter @azeemk_.  EthCC is a tech-forward, community-run event where companies and developers frequently break news about new crypto developments. EthCC6 will be held July 17-20 in France.  With venture capital inflows dwindling, asset prices spiraling and user growth stagnating, we must reconsider our strategies if we are to survive and eventually thrive. Limiting ourselves to doing business and growing the industry in the U.S., U.K. and across Europe is not the way. In fact, many of the regions some industry participants seem scared of are the places where crypto would do best and do the most good.  France, currently in the grip of large-scale civil unrest, stands as the host for the next major Ethereum conference in 2023. There's the threat of escalating police action looms, and even talk of limiting external social media access in the country in response to recent protests.  However, the lack of concern for safety and the lackadaisical attitude towards these serious issues surrounding the Paris conference simply because ""it's Paris"" is an ironic hypocrisy. This isn’t moral policing, of which there’s enough everywhere we turn these days. I’m not suggesting anyone stay home from Paris anymore than they should stay away from Bogota.  As the cryptocurrency industry teeters on the precipice of an existential crisis, introspection is more important than ever.  Rethinking our approach to the Global South is part of the answer. These regions, home to massive potential user bases, are ripe for meaningful engagement. The type that will change lives and give our industry the kinds of headlines and human stories about real progress we need more than ever.  This perspective shift is not about token airdrops or superficial outreach programs. It's about recognizing and acknowledging the power of blockchain technology to transform the lives of people across Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean and Asia while still being able to tremendously profit in the meantime.  Consider the impact of M-Pesa, a mobile money transfer service prevalent in Kenya, Tanzania, Ghana, Democratic Republic of Congo, Lesotho and Mozambique. This pre-cryptocurrency “wallet” launched by Vodafone (Safaricom) has revolutionized financial transactions for millions of individuals without access to traditional bank accounts. But M-Pesa is not without limitations – high transaction costs and dependence on a centralized authority, to name a few.  Cryptocurrencies can take the M-Pesa blueprint and improve upon it. By introducing more advanced services such as decentralized lending or interest-bearing accounts through decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, we could elevate the financial landscape to new heights the world over.  And a renewed focus on the developing world would benefit crypto, too.  For the average American, transitioning from a traditional bank to a cryptocurrency system is filled with significant switching costs and inconveniences. However, this same hurdle doesn't exist for the unbanked or underbanked in the Global South. These individuals could leapfrog directly into the era of blockchain, bypassing traditional banking systems altogether.  By focusing our efforts outside of the U.S. and Europe, we massively increase the total addressable market.  The essence of cryptocurrency lies in transformation – a transformation of economies, societies and individuals' lives. At least that’s why many of us originally got into this space. As we navigate this pivotal moment in our industry, the path forward lies not in isolation or elitist gatekeeping but in integration especially with the Global South.  See also: Global Institutional View of Crypto Rosier Outside the U.S.  We need to move away from arbitrary targets and divisive attitudes, and instead leverage the potential of blockchain technology to effect real, sustainable change. But that means doing the actual work and not just talking about it the way we do now.  Despite repeated industry declarations of valuing and prioritizing underserved communities, our actions have failed to rise to the occasion. It is high time we bridge this chasm between intention and implementation.  The mantra of ""reaching a billion users"" doesn't have to be an industry joke. By daring to extend our vision beyond the traditional boundaries and embracing the Global South with open arms, we could turn this mantra into a testament of progress, inclusivity and shared success.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT | AIRDROP,Azeem Khan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/07/11/ethcc-and-cryptos-latent-biases,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/be8eae46bf16ff0a2d991dc3d08b5293c5708d89-6000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42393170,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgGoG7,1689096322,The Big Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Bitcoin Nothingburger,"Reportedly, presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been caught supposedly in a lie about bitcoin (BTC), apparently. According to a CNBC report, the Kennedy family scion previously stated publicly he “was not an investor” in bitcoin though recently reported he held downwards of $250,000 in the cryptocurrency in a financial disclosure form.  RFK has made waves in the crypto community, including a pit stop at the largest annual industry conference Bitcoin Miami where he told the crowd he’d “defend the right of self-custody of bitcoin and other digital assets.” He also said his campaign is accepting BTC donations, though he personally did not own any of the cryptocurrency.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  “I am not here to give investment advice,” he stated, echoing a popular refrain in online investment communities. Apparently, however, the good old boy took some advice himself while in Florida and invested at least $100,001 in crypto between the date of the conference and the end of June, according to a filing CNBC obtained.  RFK’s campaign confirmed the purchase. But because this is CRYPTO and because this is POLITICS, of course there is a debate. Virginia Canter, principal counsel for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a Washington D.C.-based ethics organization, said Kennedy’s investment is a potential conflict of interest, a claim Kennedy campaign manager Dennis Kucinich denied.  Canter’s claim is that, if a politician endorses an investment he or his family members hold, it shows bias, and can be perceived as untoward. When the report first came out, the Kennedy campaign said the bitcoin belonged to Robert’s wife and “Curb Your Enthusiasm” star Cheryl Hines, and later corrected the record.  The filing shows the crypto holdings returned less than $201 in income.  Versions of this same debate about potential conflicts have long followed crypto, which makes sense given blockchains are semi-anonymous and allow anyone to buy into a network bypassing traditional investment guardrails. In the media, especially, there are concerns that journalists on the crypto beat can hold digital assets without disclosure and potentially influence markets among more subtle concerns about sentiment and.  See also: Should Crypto Journalists Own Crypto? | Opinion  Thankfully, for bitcoin, at least, we need not be too concerned. Yes, a high-profile presidential challenger could likely tilt the scales if they endorse an asset while campaigning. But so could any number of world events. Bitcoin is almost assuredly a commodity under U.S. law, meaning there can be stakeholders in the asset but no single party would benefit most from its adoption.  Just like how there are buyers, miners, builders, architects, sculptors, etc. who use a metal like copper and may be exposed to its long and short term price fluctuations, there is a massive pool of bitcoin users who hold stake. That pool would include sitting elected representatives like Senators Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Cynthia Lummis (R-WY).  Kennedy, who has been accused of spreading anti-vaxxer disinformation, has garnered support among a number of bitcoiners including Block CEO Jack Dorsey. Junior has been outspoken in his support of crypto, including criticizing a proposed 30% tax on crypto mining and calling a recent spate of regulatory action against the industry “an extra-legal war” that has damaged the country's economic prospects.  His bitcoin buy is suggestive of a lot: that he puts his money where his mouth is, that he’s easily influenced by gungho conference goers or even that he buys into the “digital gold” narrative. (Being honest, Kennedy strikes me as the type of boomer who would be hawking gold investments on talk radio, if his family wasn’t already political royalty.)  No one knows Kennedy’s true state of mind or motivations here, but what should be clear enough is that there is no inconsistency in defending the rights of bitcoiners and holding the asset. Further, .000033 BTC is almost certainly enough to make a rich man rich, but it’s probably enough to hold him to his promises.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/07/11/the-big-robert-f-kennedy-jr-bitcoin-nothingburger,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/443ac923e53f6d0a0e9f3983fbd3ef73dc0a048d-1620x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

14777449,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/07/rodeo-finance-exploited-for-1-5m-in-ethereum-eth,1689095700,Rodeo Finance Exploited for $1.5m in Ethereum $ETH,"Rodeo Finance, an Arbitrum-based decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, suffered a significant blow, losing $1.53 million in Ethereum due to a code vulnerability exploitation in its Oracle. This is the second exploit that the DeFi platform has endured in a span of a week, underscoring the escalating security issues facing such protocols. The attacker manipulated a key function to siphon funds from Rodeo's interest-bearing USDC pool, taking advantage of a vulnerability that enabled them to force a swap. Initially, 290 Wrapped Ethereum (WETH) was taken, before being bridged to the Ethereum network. The infiltrator used oracle manipulation to inflate their ETH value by swapping it for unshETH, a DeFi project aimed at promoting validator decentralization. Underlying Vulnerabilities Exploited The oracle manipulation permitted the conversion of WETH to unshETH at a rate not reflecting fair market value. The exploiter then seized the opportunity to return to the Ethereum network, further draining 230 WETH from the Rodeo vault. Before returning to the Ethereum network, they sent 150 ETH into Tornado Cash, effectively masking their tracks. The remaining balance of 371 ETH was left in the wallet. Although 520 WETH was extracted from the Rodeo vault, only 472 WETH is counted as losses, due to the attacker initially funding the wallet with 50 ETH to facilitate the exploit. Repeating Exploits This episode of Rodeo Finance’s exploitation comes shortly after the protocol suffered another security breach just last week, where a vulnerability in their mintProtocolReserves function led to a loss of approximately $89,000. Rodeo Finance isn't alone in facing these security issues. The Arbitrum network in 2023 alone has witnessed a total of 21 recorded incidents of some form of exploit, leading to a collective loss of over $20 million. The recent Rodeo Finance exploit, causing a $1.53 million loss, is the fifth-largest recorded on Aribitrum this year. After the exploit, the total value locked (TVL) in the DeFi protocol, initially at $20 million, fell below $500. Notably, the price of the native token of the DeFi protocol plummeted by over 53% in the last 24 hours. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

14776759,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=542172,1689094823,Bitcoin And Crypto Investors Must Monitor The DXY: 6x Rally Ahead?,"The Bitcoin and crypto prices are influenced by a complex web of factors and intertwined indicators. One such influential force is the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which has gained prominence as a vital gauge for Bitcoin and crypto investors. Over the past three years, BTC and the DXY have been mostly inversely correlated, except in times where crypto-specific factors overshadowed the dollar trends. Whenever the DXY experiences a decline, Bitcoin tends to embark on an impressive rally. Conversely, BTC usually falls when the DXY rises. DXY Approaches Crucial Level Since the local high of 104.7 on May 31, the DXY has dropped by nearly 3%. At the time of writing, the DXY stood at 101.8 and is now approaching the yearly low at 100.8 again, which served as support in February and April respectively and initiated a bounce to the upside. Related Reading: Bitcoin At Mid-Cycle Point: Historical Pattern Repeating Itself? As the renowned trader Gert van Lagen noted via Twitter, the situation for the U.S. dollar index is quite precarious. Van Lagen’s assessment, based on a detailed analysis of the DXY weekly chart, suggests that the US dollar is poised to continue its slide. Lower lows, lower highs, and the failure to break the blue downtrend for several months all contribute to the bearish sentiment. In addition, the DXY has abandoned the green uptrend and is displaying a bearish confirmation of 3 consecutive weeks. According to van Lagen, a crash of the DXY below 89 could be imminent. Will The Bitcoin Price Surge Sixfold? Renowned crypto analyst “Coosh” Alemzadeh also recently took to Twitter to share an intriguing observation about the correlation between the DXY and Bitcoin’s price movements. Alemzadeh’s chart below highlights that during previous instances when the DXY slipped below the critical level of 100, Bitcoin experienced a remarkable surge. Related Reading: Standard Chartered Raises Bitcoin Forecast To $120,000, Citing Miners’ Reduced Selling In 2017, Bitcoin witnessed a 10x rally, and in 2020, BTC soared by 7x. Alemzadeh predicts that if history repeats itself and the DXY drops to 89 as it did in the past, Bitcoin could potentially see a substantial price increase of 4x to 6x. The entire crypto market is likely to profit. Alemzadeh shared the chart below and stated: DXY weekly update: Looks like technical correction is complete which would align w/next BTC impulse initiating. Remarkably, Jan Happel and Yann Allemann, the founders of Glassnode, have been sharing the same opinion for quite some time. Already at the end of May, the analysts suggested an ABC structure, which has been the main source of headwinds for BTC and other risk assets. Their prediction was that once the DXY topps out, it will decline sharply, towards the 91-93 until the end of the year. “The decline should unfold in 5 waves likely into late 2023. This move should be very supportive of risk assets and particularly Bitcoin,” say the analysts who also predict the possibility of a blow-off top for risk assets. At press time, the Bitcoin price remained in its sideways trend, trading at $30,421.

The DOJ alleged that Shakeeb Ahmed was able to ""fraudulently obtain"" $9 million worth of crypto from an unnamed decentralized cryptocurrency exchange (DEX) by creating fake pricing data to generate fees that he was then able to withdraw. Police arrested Ahmed on Tuesday.  ""In July 2022, Ahmed carried out an attack on the Crypto Exchange by exploiting a vulnerability in one of the Crypto Exchange’s smart contracts and inserting fake pricing data to fraudulently cause that smart contract to generate approximately $9 million dollars’ worth of inflated fees that Ahmed did not legitimately earn, which fees Ahmed was able to withdraw from the Crypto Exchange in the form of cryptocurrency,"" a DOJ press release said.  The DEX in question operates on the Solana blockchain, the DOJ said. Ahmed allegedly took out flash loans worth ""tens of millions of dollars,"" deposited them in the DEX's liquidity pool, withdrew the funds and claimed a large percent as fees. He took out at least twenty one flash loans, according to a copy of the indictment.  Ahmed then tried to launder the funds by converting them into different cryptocurrencies, moving them across blockchains, converting into monero (XMR) and sending them through different crypto exchanges, the DOJ alleged.  Ahmed also offered to return most of the funds to the DEX in question provided the developers not reach out to law enforcement, the DOJ said.

42393173,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgGokt,1689091492,BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Application Takes Surveillance to the Next Level,"The moment finance giant BlackRock filed to create a spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S., market watchers wondered whether the world’s biggest asset manager had a better chance of approval than the many rejected predecessors. They quickly fixated on a mechanism within the application that allows suspicious trades to be flagged to the authorities.  BlackRock’s application sparked a flurry of follow-on filings with the now-ubiquitous Surveillance-Sharing Agreement (SSA) added. But what’s more likely to influence the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)’s decision is an information-sharing deal that flips the position of power in the arrangement and gives regulators the right to demand extra background.  While the SEC’s requirement for surveillance sharing to prevent market manipulation of crypto is not new – it first appeared in the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF application in 2017 – details of a “Coinbase and NASDAQ Information Sharing Term Sheet” shared with CoinDesk point to something more.  The nuance here can be characterized as the difference between push and pull. The SSA concerns data surveillance carried out by the spot exchange, Coinbase (COIN) in this case, which can be pushed to regulators, ETF providers and listing exchanges if deemed suspicious. Information-sharing agreements, in contrast, allow regulators and ETF providers to pull data from the exchange.  The information in question could be about specific trades or traders, and the agreement also compels a crypto exchange to share data up to and including personally identifiable information (PII), such as the customer’s name and address. Information-sharing agreements do not appear in any of the spot bitcoin ETF filings, but the structure is found in other markets.  An important caveat is that an information-sharing request has to be very specific, not dissimilar to a subpoena, according to a person familiar with the matter.  “It can’t just be a fishing expedition, where it’s all of the information attached to any trade that was made between two given points in time,” said the person, who asked to remain unidentified. “The obvious concern is that crypto traders, almost by definition, don’t like having information shared about them. It’s sort of anathema to the ethos of crypto in general. But for the ETF to be successful, [firms] have to do it.”  Nasdaq and Coinbase declined to comment. BlackRock did not respond to requests for comment.  Bitcoin ETF application history  Going back to 2017, the SEC has highlighted the need for bitcoin ETF applications to have a surveillance-sharing agreement with a regulated market of significant size, but firms have lacked clarity and an objective standard when it comes to interpreting this.  The inclusion of an information-sharing agreement, as opposed to simply surveillance sharing, makes sense, because it means an ETF is not reliant on an unregulated market, said Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise Asset Management. Bitwise has applied for an ETF numerous times.  “If there’s an ability to pull, then that’s coming from the regulated market; an ability to push is coming from the unregulated market,” Hougan said in an interview. “So, the SEC will want the ability for the regulated market to oversee this surveillance, and in terms of identifying the people at the bottom of these trades, I think that’s just going to be part and parcel of these agreements.”  Approval ratings  The combination of surveillance sharing and information sharing is a structure known to brokers and exchanges in equities markets, where the regulator has the authority to request more information about the end client’s trading history.  Whenever a broker has a client that sends an order to Nasdaq, for example, and that order is flagged as suspicious by the exchange’s SMARTS surveillance system, then the broker and the exchange are required to file a suspicious activity report (SAR).  Regulators investigating a SAR can go on to this “second step,” said Dave Weisberger, CEO of crypto trading platform CoinRoutes, which is requesting PII to identify whether the same beneficial owners are behind a given set of trades, creating a consolidated audit trail.  “Coinbase, Nasdaq and BlackRock are likely saying that if there is suspicious activity – and they are surveilling for it – then the regulator can request who’s doing it, but they’re not just going to give out PII willy-nilly. There is going to have to be suspicious activity. That is the equivalency here,” Weisberger said in an interview, adding:  “If that is true, I believe the SEC will not only approve this ETF, but will approve it and take a victory lap. And considering how unpopular this SEC is, I suspect they need to do that now.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/07/11/blackrocks-bitcoin-etf-application-takes-surveillance-to-the-next-level,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5176c66a7ef9e2c380456681aaefb95cd9c7cabc-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

14775112,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=542121,1689091212,This Bitcoin Rally Is Similar To Genesis Points Of Historical Uptrends: Glassnode,"Data from Glassnode reveals that the structure of the current Bitcoin rally is looking similar to the genesis points of historical uptrends. Bitcoin Recovery Since November Lows Is Reminiscent Of Past Rallies In its latest weekly report, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has looked into how the current Bitcoin rally lines up against similar rallies that the cryptocurrency observed during the previous cycles. To make this comparison, the analytics firm has taken the data for the performance of the coin starting from the all-time high in each cycle. Here is a chart that shows how the past bear market rallies have looked like in terms of this metric: The bear market rally performance throughout the different cycles | Source: Glassnode's The Week Onchain - Week 28, 2023 Note that only the upwards performance of Bitcoin is being considered here, and the drawdown has been excluded. From the chart, it’s visible that during all the cycles, gains after the ATH was set disappeared in time as the bear market went into full gear. Soon after the bear bottom formation took place, these cycles saw the asset experiencing a recovery rally. In the current cycle so far, it’s not completely certain yet if the November 2022 low seen after the FTX crash was indeed the cyclical bottom. However, if it’s assumed that this low was indeed the bottom, then the rally that has been going on in the past few months would take the role of the recovery rally in the current cycle. Related Reading: Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross Says BTC Is Overpriced, Decline Soon? Interestingly, so far, the cryptocurrency has seen an uplift of 91% since the aforementioned bottom, which is very similar in scale to the recovery rallies of the past cycles. “With the exception of 2019, all prior cycles which experienced a similar magnitude move off the bottom, were in fact the genesis point of a new cyclical uptrend,” explains Glassnode. The reason 2019 was different is that the April 2019 rally (which may have normally acted as the recovery rally from the bear market bottom) ran out of steam before long and the price subsequently declined. The drawdown was then extended in March 2020 as the crash due to the emergence of COVID-19 took place. It’s the recovery rally from this crash that ended up leading to the 2021 bull market. Naturally, if the pattern of the first two Bitcoin cycles is anything to go by, the current recovery rally structure may mean that the asset is now on its way toward a cyclical uptrend.

The drawdowns across the bull markets | Source: Glassnode's The Week Onchain - Week 28, 2023 As displayed in the graph, the Bitcoin rally has seen a peak drawdown of just 18% so far, which is clearly much less than what the previous bull markets saw. “This perhaps suggests a relatively strong degree of demand underlies the asset,” suggests Glassnode.

42393172,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgGoQN,1689090599,Why Threads Got 100 Million Users When Other Twitter Rivals Could Not,"Twitter has been ripe for disruption for years now. People love to complain about it or leave in protest of how terrible it’s become. There have been many opportunities for Twitter to be challenged by a decentralized social network that truly empowers users. And there have been quite a few attempts. But none have come close to rivaling Twitter.  Now, thanks to widespread frustration with the excessive power of Elon Musk, a Twitter rival has landed. And no, it’s not the brainchild of some crypto-native start-up. It comes via Meta, another company ruled by an excessively powerful billionaire. That didn’t stop Threads from hitting 100 million users in less than a week.  Emily Parker is CoinDesk's executive director of global content.  There’s a lesson here, if a painfully obvious one. When it comes to social media, or at least social media at scale, people ultimately care about network effects and ease of use. That’s pretty much it. Yes, it would be nice to have data privacy, higher quality conversations, protection of “free speech” (whatever that means exactly) and maybe greater ownership over your content. But those concerns have yet to prevail.  Before going any further, let’s be clear: Threads will not necessarily be a huge success. Sometimes platforms arrive with a bang only to fade into cultural irrelevance – remember Clubhouse? But again: Threads got 100 million users in five days, and that number could still grow. Rival upstarts simply have not gained that kind of traction. Mastodon claims to have around 2 million monthly active users. It’s hard to get exact numbers for the decentralized social media protocol Nostr, but an estimate based on Damus and Amethyst downloads is likely around 500,000 to 1 million, according to Damus. The invite-only Bluesky had some 50,000 users at the end of April, and since then got at least 58,000 new sign ups. These numbers aren’t bad, but these are the relatively successful rivals, not the ones you haven’t even heard about.  Threads’ early boom basically comes down to Threads’ integration with Instagram, which has over 2 billion monthly active users. In other words, people are already there. People have been saying for years that they yearn for smaller, more intimate platforms, but are often addicted to the potential of virality. I have some personal experience with this, as part of a team that tried to build one of those smaller, more intimate platforms. While the resulting product was far from perfect, I also saw firsthand how hard it is for a new player to compete with the sheer numbers of Twitter and Facebook.  Read more: David Z Morris - Threads Is Libra and Meta All Over Again  Threads has another key feature: If you are already an Instagram user, then onboarding is easy. You don’t need to establish a whole new identity, and the people you follow can be transferred from one platform to the next.  Threads’ early success has lessons not only for social media start-ups, but also for crypto as it pursues the often elusive goal of “mainstream adoption.” Because money, like social media, only really works if enough people use it.  So here are a few key lessons:  Sometimes you might have to play ball with bigger players, at least initially. In other words, go where people are. That’s why people get so excited about “institutional adoption” or the possibility of a Bitcoin ETF. Giving people a gateway to crypto through known, trusted brands with established customer bases can make sense at this point in time. That’s likely why Polygon struck a deal with Instagram itself, to give just one example. This is not a solution for every project, and can indeed take some of the fun and uniqueness out of crypto, but there is clearly a logic behind such strategic alliances.  Onboarding and ease of use matters. A lot. This seems almost too obvious to write but given that so many crypto products remain confusing and hard to use, it bears repeating. You can have a visionary product with a roadmap to remake society, but that may not matter if the user experience is terrible or people have to jump through hoops to create on account. It also means that, for better or worse, we probably need centralized crypto exchanges and governments (see: United States) to establish clearer regulatory frameworks for them. Yes, these exchanges might be less secure or philosophically pure than decentralized finance, but they probably offer a more familiar gateway for the more mainstream set.  People care about data privacy and decentralization, but not that much. Mark Zuckerberg has an almost comically bad reputation when it comes to protecting user data. But at least 100 million people are clearly ready to move past it. Some are raising questions about Threads’ privacy policy but a lot of people probably didn’t even bother to read it. And sure, many apparently disliked the idea of a centralized social media platform being subject to the whims of a billionaire, but they were able to move past that as well.  This is not to say that data privacy isn’t critically important. Of course it is. Decentralization has its appeal as well. But these lofty goals are simply not enough. Without network effects or ease of use, they won’t catapult a product into the mainstream. That is the main lesson from Threads’ spectacular five days.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MATIC,Emily Parker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/07/11/why-threads-got-100-million-users-when-other-twitter-rivals-could-not,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c3296d5d2d18571abd1c5bd9f591082a6ad92e91-1024x637.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This involves the collaboration of Bitcoin payments startup Zebedee and the Minecraft server to fuse the world of cryptocurrency with gaming. Rewards in bitcoin While offering over 1 million satoshis per week to winning players, their earnings may not be extravagant. However, it’s a nifty bonus for playing one of the world's most popular video games. Appealing to the most dedicated gamers, this Bitcoin initiative adds a real twist to gameplay. Players are inspired by gameplay elements resembling Bitcoin mining rigs and mining pool collectives, with an added excitement of amping up their mining ""hash rate"" to win Bitcoin rewards in the game. It may not offer substantial rewards, but this new trend connects the budding world of cryptocurrency with exciting gaming experiences. Beyond Minecraft, Zebedee's cutting-edge gaming tech has been implemented in numerous mobile games as well as premier traditional games like Valve’s Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Their technology has also enabled Bitcoin betting and won players Bitcoin rewards throughout 2021. Minecraft NFT ban? However, the relationship between the gaming world and cryptocurrency has experienced some turbulence. Minecraft's hinted NFT ban has led some servers and derivative initiatives to shift gears or close operations. For instance, NFT Worlds, which used to sell NFT-based land sections for a specific Minecraft server, ended up creating its own autonomous game. Despite the prospective cryptocurrency ban, the likes of Satlantis are continuing their Bitcoin initiative. Whether they would continue unfazed in the face of an official ban remains unclear, as Zebedee representatives have not commented on any foreseeable implications. The gaming industry and cryptocurrency may be charting unexpected courses according to Minecraft's potential restrictions, but it’s clear that the intersection of these two worlds is ever-evolving, creating a fascinating and dynamic landscape.

At the end of 2022, GBTC's discount to NAV had swelled to almost 50% and spent much of this year at around 40%, as prices of major digital tokens changed hands at depressed levels from a couple years ago, according to data from ycharts. The discount started to narrow significantly in mid-June, when asset management giant BlackRock ( BLK ) filed an application with the SEC to launch an ETF that invests directly in bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), having dropped to as low as 26.7% on July 6. The discount stood at 28.2% as of July 10. BlackRock's ( BLK ) spot bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) ETF filing fueled a spate of filings and re-filings for similar products from other prominent money managers like Fidelity Investments. Still, the SEC has been rejecting such products for years, including Grayscale's filing from almost two years ago. Seeking Alpha analyst Logan Kane said last week that GBTC ( OTC:GBTC ) is the best crypto pick for the next six months, saying “I believe Bitcoin is the only game in town for crypto, and that the unique circumstances of GBTC make GBTC the best way to play Bitcoin.” More on GBTC and the crypto market: Grayscale Bitcoin Trust: Remains Attractive At A 28% Discount To NAV Closing In On A Ruling In Grayscale Vs.

42393192,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgGwwf,1689088475,Federal Prosecutors Investigate Former FTX Executive Over Possible Campaign Law Violations: WSJ,"Federal prosecutors in Manhattan are investigating a former FTX executive over possible violations of campaign finance law related to his girlfriend's congressional campaign last year, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday.  Ryan Salame, who was FTX's co-chief executive of its Bahamas-based unit, is being investigated for potentially illegally avoiding federal limits on contributions to Michelle Bond's campaign for the Republican primary for New York's 1st congressional district, according to the report, citing people familiar with the matter.  Prosecutors are looking at money Salame donated to Bond's campaign. The investigation dates back to at least April, when a search warrant was executed for the couple's home in Maryland and the two had their cellphones seized. At the time of Bond's campaign, she was CEO of a trade group called the Association for Digital Asset Markets and also worked as a $200,000-a-year-consultant for FTX, according to a congressional financial disclosure statement.  The investigation concerning Salame is being treated separately from that into founder Sam Bankman-Fried, which include campaign finance law violations as well as fraud and conspiracy. Salame has not been charged in the FTX case, but he has previously been identified by the Wall Street Journal as an unnamed co-conspirator cited in Bankman-Fried's indictment who allegedly took part in a campaign-finance plot unrelated to Bond.  Bankman-Fried is due to face trial in New York in October following the dramatic collapse of the exchange last November.

42393196,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgGxbh,1689087826,Dan Harmon’s Web3 TV Show ‘Krapopolis’ Finally Gets Premiere Date,"After months of anticipation, Emmy-winning “Rick and Morty” co-creator and producer Dan Harmon’s latest adult-aimed animated television show “Krapopolis” is set to release in the fall.  According to a press release, TV network FOX will air the first two episodes of the show on Sunday, September 24, following its NFL doubleheader that day. The next week the show will join its “Animation Domination” programming block and will follow “The Simpsons” at 8:30 p.m.  “Krapopolis,” a comedy series that centers on a family of humans, gods and monsters in Ancient Greece, features voice actors including “Ted Lasso” star Hannah Waddingham, “The IT Crowd” star Richard Ayoade, “The Midnight Gospel” actor Duncan Trussell and Matt Berry from “What We Do in the Shadows” among its high-profile cast.  The show’s content will be influenced by fans who own a Krapopolis Krap Chicken – a non-fungible token (NFT) that allows holders to vote on show components, see exclusive token-gated content, participate in gamified experiences like scavenger hunts, access a Discord channel and attend in-person events with the cast. Krapopolis is operated by FOX’s Web3 entertainment company Blockchain Creative Labs, and is the network’s first blockchain-based series.  Krapopolis released its Krap Chicken NFT collection in August 2022, and cost 0.18 ETH, or $336, to mint on the show’s website. According to data from NFT marketplace OpenSea, although the collection has raked in 512 ETH – over $956,000 in secondary sales – the collection’s floor price is trading below its mint price at 0.0824, or $154 ETH.  In March, upon the news of the collection’s renewal for a third season, the floor price of the Krap Chicken NFT cost 0.11 ETH, about $170 at the time. The lower price reflects the NFT winter that has chilled many leading collections including Bored Ape Yacht Club, whose price sank to a 20-month low last week.  Despite lower prices, many entertainment creators and industry executives are turning to Web3 as a mechanism to disrupt traditional Hollywood production regimes. In April, Web3 entertainment company Toonstar released “Space Junk” starring ""Napoleon Dynamite"" actor Jon Heder that allows fans to engage with the intellectual property (IP) of the show through NFTs.

At the time of writing, SOL has gained 6.07% in 24 hours and 14.52% in one week. The question now is, since SOL is gaining when other assets are losing, what’s next for the crypto asset? SOL Gains While Top Coins Loses, Any Reason? Solana is an open-source project utilizing the permissionless feature of the blockchain to offer decentralized finance solutions. Since its launch in 2020, the crypto network has continued pushing its relevance. As of today, July 11, 2023, the crypto project occupies the 9th position on the Coinmarketcap ranking. Related Reading: Microstrategy Stock Surges 7% As Berenberg Highlights Bitcoin Halving’s Impact Apart from its rank, SOL is gaining today in price, trading volume, and market cap. The increased activities on its network have pushed the trading volume to $524,345,790, representing a 19.13% increase in 24 hours. Also, its market capitalization now stands at $8,867,175,756, showing a 6.11% increase in 24 hours. Usually, when the global market cap gains, it shows that many crypto assets are recording gains. But given that top assets are not gaining currently, network-related news or developments might be pushing SOL’s gains. One of the recent events related to Solana is the prediction that a former CEO of Goldman Sachs, Raoul Pal, released on it. Pal, now the Real Vision CEO, stated that Solana could move the way Ethereum did after losing massively in 2018. Pal pointed out that ETH gained 47x times after it recorded a very low value in 2018. As such, he expects SOL to surge 20x its price now. Pal said, “There is a potential, a dream scenario, for SOL to do the same thing Ethereum did from its low in 2018 when it increased 47-fold. Solana’s lowest price was $9, so the numbers could get very interesting with simple math. In my view, Solana could increase its value 20 times with current prices.” What’s Next For SOL Investors? Based on SOL’s daily chart above, the price trend is positive as the coin trades above the 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages. This position shows that SOL is sporting a bullish trend in the short and long term. Related Reading: Standard Chartered Raises Bitcoin Forecast To $120,000, Citing Miners’ Reduced Selling Also, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 68.78, close to the overbought region of 70. Since the line points upward, SOL will record more gains, but when it reaches the overbought zone, a trend reversal to the downside will likely occur. Lastly, the MACD line is above the signal depicting a bullish trend. But again, the faded histogram bars suggest a possible trend reversal very soon. So while SOL is currently bullish, traders should note the bars and the RSI pointing at a possible trend reversal.

According to data by CoinMarketCap, MATIC gained by 10.44% over the last 24 hours, representing a better market performance than most top assets, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), etc. MATIC’s Price Overview In July Since the beginning of the month, the MATIC market has experienced a series of gains and losses, which, so far, have been in line with the general crypto market. Related Reading: BNB Price at Make-or-Break Levels As The Bulls Aim Big Above This Resistance MATIC began the month trading around $0.66 before witnessing a steady price rise to hit the $0.71 resistance zone on July 4. However, after failing to break past this barrier, the ERC-20 token saw its price fall by 7%, returning to the $0.66 price mark the following day. On July 6, MATIC attempted another bullish run but was followed by a sharp price decline. But since then, the token has seen a steady price increase since then, leading up to its recent price boost. In the early hours of today, MATIC‘s price shot up by 10%, breaking past the $0.71 resistance level to attain a peak price of $0.74, and has since remained in that zone. This price increase moves MATIC’s total gain in July to 12.12% as of this writing. In addition, blockchain analytics firm Santiment also reported the Polygon utility token to have recently witnessed “some positive on-chain signs.” These included an increase in new daily addresses, declining exchange supply, and low-profit taking. According to data by CoinMarketCap, MATIC is currently exchanging hands at $0.74, with a 0.86% gain in the last hour. The token’s trading volume is up by 93.17% and is now sitting at $543.19 million. With a market cap of $6.9 billion, MATIC ranks as the 12th-largest cryptocurrency. Is A Bullish Run On For MATIC? Following MATIC’s price hike today, there is likely much speculation on the token’s next movement. Looking at its 4-hour chart, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has just dipped below the overbought zone indicating a bearish trend on the horizon. However, its Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is well-placed above the signal line, so the bullish run may still be on. According to MATIC’s price movement, the token appears to be in an ascending channel recording higher highs and lows in the last month. If MATIC manages to break out of its current consolidation zone, it is expected to only trade as high as $0.77, which represents its next resistance level. Related Reading: MATIC Price Prediction: Polygon Bulls Aim For $0.80 On the other hand, if the bears do assume control of the market, they could push the price of MATIC as low as $0.69, which marks the token’s next support level.

42393200,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgGy1L,1689084000,Data Startup Space and Time Creates Chatbot Powered by ChatGPT for Database Querying,"Decentralized data startup Space and Time, backed by Microsoft's venture arm and Hashkey Capital, has integrated a chatbot using OpenAI's GPT-4, the latest version of ChatGPT, so that developers can maintain and query databases with ease, the firm told CoinDesk on Tuesday.  Space and Time has created decentralized data warehouse with both on-chain and off-chain information such that the datapoints can be analyzed and used by smart contracts.  The data warehouse is powered by zero-knowledge proofs (ZKs), a type of cryptographic proof that can prove the validity of a statement while only selectively revealing any information about the statement itself. The startup has applied ZK proofs on data queries, which are commonly run by using Structured Query Language (SQL), a programming language designed for managing and searching in relational databases, which store datapoints that are related to each other.  Space and Time's technology, proof-of-SQL, ""allows the data warehouse to generate a SNARK cryptographic proof of SQL query execution, proving that query computation was done accurately and that both the query and the data are verifiably tamperpoof,"" according to its website. Within Web 3 environments, this is particularly important because there are no trusted entities to ensure the accuracy of the data or the query.  The integration of the chatbot, called Houston, using OpenAI's ChatGPT will make it easier to maintain and query databases using natural language prompts, as opposed to having to write code.  ""Space and Time users can generate SQL or Python scripts from prompts, ask natural-language questions about data and get back an accurate visualization of the answer and load in new datasets, all by simply conversing with our chatbot,"" said Scott Dykstra, CTO and co-founder of the startup.  Houston also presents the SQL code generated through a natural language prompt so that it can be examined, and creates visual representations of the query and the results, said Nate Holiday, the startup's co-founder and CEO.

Arkham’s Privacy Problem It is never a good idea to be negligent with customer data, especially in the crypto and blockchain space, where users value their security and privacy above everything else. Looks like crypto data firm Arkham Intelligence has learned this the hard way. The company committed multiple gaffes when it revealed its latest service that would uncover the identities of digital wallet owners. Privacy-conscious crypto advocates rose up in arms about this new service when they realized the firm had already been inadvertently leaking private customer information through its referral program. Faulty Referral Program Doxxed User Emails Under this program, users could invite others to the Arkham platform by sharing a unique referral URL. At quick glance, these URLs appeared to be a random string of characters. But under deeper inspection, it was uncovered that they could be easily deciphered to reveal the user’s email address, encrypted with Base64. The company’s biggest product allows tracking crypto transactions and identification of wallet owners. Its latest product, “Intel Exchange,” has raised even more eyebrows in the privacy-focused corners of the cryptoverse. The uncovering of the weblink slip-up has already added to the company’s reputation of not following a more privacy-focused approach in its services and operations. M4gicpotato Comments On Privacy Breach A privacy advocate known as m4gicpotato, who has been involved in crypto under various aliases since 2017 and is a contributor to the privacy blockchain Beam, shed light on the matter via Twitter. They wrote, “All Arkham referral links shared on Twitter is doxxing everyone because the email is in the referral URL.” The post quickly gained viral attention, with m4gicpotato expressing concerns about the infringement on user privacy. They have also criticized Arkham's decision to encode user emails using Base64, emphasizing that this additional layer of obfuscation compounded the privacy concerns surrounding the company. The full extent of the number of affected users remains unclear. In theory, anyone who generated and shared a referral link may have inadvertently disclosed their email address. Some users even posted their links on Twitter, further exacerbating the potential privacy risks. CEO Responds The company’s CEO, Miguel Morel, responded to the controversy, claiming that the coding of the referral program was done in this manner in the beta stage to allow Arkham to identify and reward users who were referring others. He claimed that the change has already been made to the code to encrypt user email properly to prevent reverse engineering. He tweeted, “Our industry has been plagued with bad actors who survive by hiding in the shadows. Crypto intelligence brings them into the light, and that’s what our platform and our research have always done.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The commission isn’t proposing any new laws and is vague about funding for what it sees as the next generation of the internet, but politicians are eager for the bloc to make the most of a technology they see as having economic and ethical salience.  “Today, Europe throws its hat in the ring to become a world leader in Web 4.0 and virtual worlds,” said Thierry Breton, the European Commissioner for the bloc’s internal market, said in a statement. “Europe has what it takes to lead the next technological transition.”  The EU executive – which says virtual worlds could be worth 800 billion euros ($880 billion) globally by 2030, likely based on blockchain and cryptocurrency – also plans funding to keep Europe competitive, with levels unspecified but potentially high.  For a new virtual worlds partnership to be set up the commission’s science funding program, Horizon Europe, “you could think of an amount in the order of 200 million euros that will be available,” as well as potential investment via EU regional funds, said a commission official, speaking under condition of anonymity.  Political interest is high. In March, leaders of all the EU’s 27 member states put “Web 4.0” among a shopping list of technologies the bloc needs to stay competitive, alongside artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing and 6G internet networks.  For EU lawmaker Axel Voss, the metaverse raises a host of legal issues – like giving avatars their own legal status, protecting copyright and patents, and dealing with virtual crime.  “There are a lot of questions that would need to be answered and I'm not expecting that the commission is answering everything,” Voss, a German Member of the European Parliament who spearheaded the EU’s recent work on AI, said in an interview held before he had seen the proposals.  Voss appears to favor going further than the commission, and suggested existing laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation will need to change for the metaverse.  “GDPR is totally not in line with new technologies,” he said of the EU’s landmark privacy rules, citing AI, blockchain and cloud computing. “We need a kind of a modernization or updating of the GDPR, and then aligning these also to new technologies.”  He believes the EU failed to tackle illegal content on social media early enough, and the bloc isn’t home to major Web 2.0 companies – errors that he worries could be repeated for the metaverse.  “Old-fashioned people also laughed about the internet, and all of a sudden you have a totally different world,” he said. “If we are not acting now, if we are not acting together, and if we are not acting on priorities, I can't see that we will catch up.”  Read more: EU’s Leaked Metaverse Strategy Proposes Regulatory Sandbox, New Global Governance",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/07/11/eus-metaverse-vision-focuses-on-standards-governance-and-funding,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/be123b8d38370e728baf4beacfd0c9599697a796-1280x853.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Index Coop identified a large number of challenges facing the rather nascent area of structured products in the digital asset industry, among them infrastructure limitations, in a new report published on Tuesday.  Structured on-chain products are defined by the report as ""any token, platform or vault that enables access to digital asset risks and returns and is delivered via a blockchain without the involvement of a centralized or traditional financial institution."" The most prominent of these include Aave's wrapped ETH (wETH) and Yearn Finance's ETH and staked ETH (stETH) vaults.  The infrastructure limitations of this sector include a lack of cross-chain asset support, expense in maintaining products due to high issuance costs and difficulty rebalancing on-chain products due to slippage (the difference between a trade’s expected price and the price at which the trade is executed).  ""At the Index Coop, engineers are exploring auction-based rebalancing as a potential solution to lessen NAV decay,"" Index said in the report.  Structured products remain a small sector, with a combined total valued locked (TVL) of just under $2.5 billion, according to Index's report, accounting for just 0.21% of the wider crypto market.  Structured products in traditional finance typically combine several products, such as stocks or bonds, into a single package. Should their use in crypto grow, they could be seen as evidence of the growing sophistication of the industry and its increasing ability to attract mainstream investors.

14770094,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/07/3-promising-crypto-projects-to-watch-for-the-next-bull-run,1689080400,3 Promising Crypto Projects To Watch For The Next Bull Run,"In this article, we’ll be highlighting three remarkable crypto projects that are expected to make waves in the upcoming bull run - according to crypto analysts. Delve into the world of futuristic investments with InQubeta, the crypto crowdfunding platform transforming AI startup investments. Additionally, explore the dynamic potential of Ethereum, the pioneering smart contract platform, and Polkadot, the creative multi-chain ecosystem, as they emerge as the top contenders in the competitive realm of blockchain technology. InQubeta: Taking AI Startup Investment To The Next Level A lot of investors are tired of the same opportunities and want to add some excitement to their portfolio, now, they need to look no further than InQubeta. InQubeta is not an average crypto crowdfunding platform - it’s here to shake the space up. This project proves that traditional investment methods can be a thing of the past, as the world's first crypto crowdfunding platform that enables fractional investment in AI startups using $QUBE tokens is introduced. With InQubeta, individuals can dive into the world of AI startups and invest in a manner that suits their budget. The NFT marketplace of InQubeta is buzzing with opportunities where AI startups raise funds and offer reward and equity-based NFTs. The intriguing aspect is that each investment opportunity is minted into an NFT and fractionalized, allowing individuals to participate without incurring significant costs. InQubeta has even taken things a step further with their deflationary ERC20 token, $QUBE. This is not just an ordinary token; it is a deflationary currency that becomes even more valuable over time. A 2% tax on all buy and sell transactions is directed to a burn wallet, resulting in the token becoming scarcer. Additionally, a 5% sell tax is allocated to a dedicated reward pool, providing an opportunity for individuals to earn rewards by staking their tokens. InQubeta offers a project that holds great potential, and AI fans should definitely take note. Ethereum: Unleashing the Power of Smart Contracts and Decentralized Applications When it comes to blockchain platforms, Ethereum stands tall as the original pioneer and a force to be reckoned with. Born in 2015, Ethereum introduced the concept of smart contracts, which transformed the way transactions are executed on the blockchain. This decentralized platform allows developers to build and deploy their own applications without relying on intermediaries, offering a level of transparency and security that traditional systems can only dream of. One of Ethereum's major strengths lies in its vast network and active community. Developers from all corners of the world have flocked to Ethereum, creating a vibrant ecosystem of decentralized finance (DeFi) projects, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and inventive dApps that cover a wide range of industries. This rich ecosystem has solidified Ethereum's position as the go-to platform for creating and launching new tokens, conducting initial coin offerings (ICOs), and experimenting with novel financial instruments. Scalability has been a challenge for Ethereum, as increased usage has resulted in network congestion and high fees. However, Ethereum is addressing these issues through the implementation of Ethereum 2.0, a major upgrade that introduces a new consensus mechanism called Proof of Stake (PoS) and shard chains. This upgrade aims to significantly enhance scalability, security, and energy efficiency, making Ethereum even more robust and attractive to developers and users alike. Polkadot: Unlocking a New Era of Blockchain Interoperability and Scalability Polkadot emerges as a remarkable project that seeks to bridge the gap between different blockchains. Founded by one of Ethereum's co-founders, Polkadot introduces a multi-chain framework that enables interoperability, allowing various blockchains to perfectly communicate and share information with each other. Polkadot's architecture revolves around a relay chain that serves as the heart of the network, coordinating communication and consensus between connected blockchains, known as parachains. These parachains operate independently, each with its own unique features, governance models, and specialized functionalities. This modular approach provides flexibility and scalability, as new parachains can be added without disrupting the entire network. By facilitating interoperability, Polkadot opens up a world of possibilities for cross-chain applications and collaborations. Developers can create decentralized applications that can interact with multiple blockchains, harnessing the strengths and features of each chain to enhance functionality and efficiency. This interoperability also paves the way for secure asset transfer between different chains, enabling new use cases and driving invention in areas such as decentralized finance, supply chain management, and gaming. Polkadot's governance model, based on on-chain voting and a nominated proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, ensures that decisions regarding network upgrades and the addition of new parachains are made in a transparent and decentralized manner. This community-driven approach fosters inclusivity and empowers stakeholders to actively participate in shaping the future of the Polkadot ecosystem. Conclusion Respected crypto analysts recognize the immense potential of these projects and believe they are well-positioned to thrive in the evolving crypto landscape. As the market gears up for the next bull run, investors should pay close attention to InQubeta, Ethereum, and Polkadot, as they represent exciting opportunities for growth and creativity in the crypto space.

14769952,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=542115,1689080145,Crypto Update: Top 3 Altcoins To Watch This Week,"While the Bitcoin price is currently stuck in a sideways trend, a few altcoins on the crypto market are currently showing a strong momentum. These three altcoins are currently attracting the attention of investors and traders alike: Shiba Inu (SHIB), Solana (SOL), and Polygon (MATIC). Let’s dive into the technical chart analysis of these altcoins and examine the potential price moves that could unfold this week. Shiba Inu (SHIB) – A Make-or-Break Moment SHIB finds itself at a critical juncture, where the next move could determine its trajectory for the rest of the year. After experiencing a remarkable rally earlier this year, SHIB entered a descending trend channel at the beginning of February, dragging its price below the yearly opening level. However, a breakthrough from this channel occurred over the weekend, signaling a potential reversal. Related Reading: Arkham’s New Crypto Intel Trading Platform: A Game Changer For Traders? As the SHIB bulls attempt to validate this breakout, their success could propel the price upwards by 30%, as NewsBTC reported yesterday. This would bring SHIB towards the resistance area between $0.00000969 (200-day EMA) and $0.00000977 (38.2% Fibonacci), with a significant psychological milestone of $0.00001 within reach. Nonetheless, a confirmation of the breakout is still pending. While the Shiba Inu price managed to stay above the trend channel yesterday, the bulls are still hesitant to make an impulsive move higher towards the 23.6% Fibonacci level at $0.00000834. A breakout above this can be seen as confirmation of a trend change. Solana (SOL) – Rising Against The Crypto Odds Solana (SOL) made a splash in the crypto market last week, recording an impressive 39% price increase over the last 12 days. This surge propelled SOL to the critical resistance level represented by the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA). Breaking through this level has been a persistent challenge for SOL since April 2022, but recent developments offer hope for a potential breakthrough. At press time, the SOL price overcame the 200-EMA at $21.98, trading at 22.07. A daily close above this price level would be massively bullish. SOL’s rally is particularly noteworthy, considering the setbacks it faced due to the FTX drama and the SEC’s classification of it as a security. Should the 200-day EMA be breached, the 50% Fibonacci retracement level and the yearly high at $27.00 could serve as the next targets for an extended rally, which could give investors another 22% profit, as detailed in our last analysis. Related Reading: Hackers Have Stolen $30 Billion In Crypto Since 2012, SlowMist Report Finds Polygon (MATIC) – New Momentum Recent developments have sparked interest and potential opportunities for investors. The announcement of former Chief Legal Officer Marc Boiron as the new CEO has generated positive sentiment within the community. On-chain data indicates a significant spike in social volume following the news, suggesting increased attention and potential bullish sentiment for MATIC’s price. From a technical standpoint, MATIC has seen a 40% increase since its local bottom in June. The price currently sits below the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level, and a breakout above this level could potentially drive MATIC towards the 200-day EMA and the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level, offering a 22% rally. However, breaking the resistance at the first Fibonacci level at $0.756 is a crucial step to watch for potential upward momentum.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  The discount to net asset value (NAV) for the $19 billion-plus Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) continues to narrow in the wake of asset manager BlackRock’s application to open a spot bitcoin ETF in the United States. The discount to NAV fell to as low as 26% at one point last week – the trimmest level since May 2022 – and currently sits at about 27%, according to data from Ycharts. BlackRock’s move for a spot bitcoin ETF set off a number of filings and re-filings for similar funds from a number of other industry actors, including from fellow asset management giant Fidelity.  Crypto data firm Arkham Intelligence stirred controversy Monday by announcing a new service aimed at unmasking the owners of digital wallets, angering privacy-focused crypto advocates. It turns out Arkham has already been leaking its own customers’ private information, a revelation that also seems to have emerged Monday, putting a spotlight on the companys own approach to user privacy just as it was rolling out a service meant to unmask crypto wallet owners on a massive scale. The issue stems from the way Arkham set up its weblink referral program. Users of Arkham’s wallet tracking dashboard can invite others onto the platform by sharing their unique referral URL. Those URLs appear to end with a meaningless jumble of characters. In reality, they’re an easy-to-decipher version of the user’s email address written in Base64, which is trivial to decode.  Bitcoin (BTC) could rise to $50,000 by the end of this year and up to $120,000 by end-2024, Standard Chartered Bank said in a research report on Monday. The British multinational bank in April had put out a $100,000 forecast for the end of 2024, noting at that time the banking crisis, among other factors. ""We now think this estimate is too conservative, and we therefore see upside to our end-2024 target,"" yesterday’s report said, this time pointing to increased miner profitability as among the bullish catalysts.  Chart of the Day  The 30-day simple moving average of the number of bitcoin moved from miner wallets to centralized exchanges surged to a record high of 2581.98 BTC on Monday.  In other words, miners have transferred over 77,000 BTC ($2.3 billion) to exchanges in the past 30 days, adding to selling pressure in the market.

14768497,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/07/bis-crypto-and-stablecoins-may-threaten-financial-stability,1689076932,BIS: Crypto and Stablecoins May Threaten Financial Stability,"A newly released survey and report from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) claims if widely used, cryptoassets and stablecoins may threaten financial stability. The BIS published a new survey and report detailing the state of global CBDC (central bank digital currency) adoption and central banks’ view and plans regarding CBDCs. Almost 25% of Central Banks are Piloting Retail CBDCs The report, entitled “Making Headway – Results of the 2022 BIS Survey on central bank digital currencies and Crypto,” finds the number of central banks planning on launching CBDC in the near future has doubled since the previous year, despite the chaos in the market. In its report, the BIS, however, warned of the risks of using cryptoassets for payments. It said: If widely used for payments, cryptoassets, including stablecoins, may constitute a threat to financial stability. While accepting the reality of widespread CBDC introduction, the BIS and other global regulators will issue guidelines to mitigate the danger it associates with the industry. The BIS explained: To strengthen and coordinate regulatory approaches to contain their risks to the financial system, the CPMI, IOSCO, FSB and BCBS published updated or new guidance and standards for stablecoins or crypto activities and markets more broadly. Through its research, the BIS found that almost a quarter of all central banks are currently piloting retail CBDCs. The BIS expects over two dozen such state-backed digital currencies to roll out by the decade’s end. BIS Expects 15 Retail, Nine Wholesale CBDCs To Launch CBDCs have already been issued by Nigeria, the Bahamas, Jamaica, and parts of the Caribbean, and according to the survey, those regions will soon be joined by several other territories. The report explains that work on retail CBDCs is more advanced than wholesale CBDCs. The BIS report reads: Work on retail CBDC is more advanced than on wholesale CBDC: almost a quarter of central banks are piloting a retail CBDC. More than 80% of central banks see potential value in having both a retail CBDC and a fast payment system, mostly because a retail CBDC has specific properties and may offer additional features. The BIS expects that by the end of 2030, 15 retail CBDCs, and nine wholesale CBDCs will be circulated in established and emerging economies. According to the report, 60% of surveyed central banks explained the arrival and rise of stablecoins had accelerated their development of CBDCs. 2022 Crypto-Chaos Leaves Central Banks Divided 2022’s market spiral, however, did not convince all central banks of the necessity of CBDCs. The report find that while 93% of all central banks are exploring CBDCs in some way, an increasing number of those banks expressed with greater conviction that they would not issue a state-backed digital currency soon. The report states: A clear divergence has emerged: compared to last year, some central banks have become more likely to issue a CBDC within the next three years, while others indicated to be less likely to do so. BIS Backs Tokenisation, But Says Crypto is a “Flawed System” The BIS, considered by many as the central bank of central banks, recently released its plan for a global “unified ledger” that would support CBDCs and tokenized assets. According to the organization, tokenization offers a “major leap” in the financial system, calling it “the next logical step.” While it advocated for a centralized approach to the future of the monetary system, it dismissed decentralized cryptocurrencies as a “flawed system.” It said: Crypto and decentralized finance (DeFi) have offered a glimpse of tokenization’s promise, but crypto is a flawed system that cannot take on the mantle of the future of money. Moreover, the BIS argued that “crypto has collapsed”, and the successful use of tokenization relies on the trust provided by central banks.

14768455,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=542110,1689076831,"Ex Paxful CEO Warns Users to ‘Stop Trading’, Are Their Funds At Risk?","Paxful, founded in 2015, has established itself as one of the world’s prominent peer-to-peer Bitcoin marketplaces, with a strong mission to enable financial access for individuals globally. Boasting an extensive user base of 9 million and offering over 350 payment options, the platform has garnered substantial popularity. However, on July 7, Ray Youssef, the former CEO of Paxful, conveyed a message to the platform’s users, urging them to cease trading activities. Financial Instability And Comparisons To FTX Collapse Youssef expressed concerns about the current state of Paxful, claiming that the company is now solely focused on paying legal bills and cautioned that no African or non-American should trust any IS corporation. These warnings from Youssef were prompted by reports that Paxful had removed the reserve funds amount from the platform’s status page. Related Reading: Paxful CEO Says He Has ‘Lost’ 5 Bank Accounts Reserve funds are often savings accounts or highly liquid assets placed aside to cover unforeseen financial responsibilities, and Youssef believes that Paxful’s lack of reserves puts the company at risk of financial instability. Without these funds, Paxful may struggle to manage cash flow fluctuations, fulfill immediate financial obligations, or respond effectively to emergencies. Consequently, this situation has the potential to jeopardize Paxful’s survival. Youssef also concurred with a Twitter user who compared Paxful and the collapse of FTX. The user highlighted that FTX, despite being one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges at the time, had filed for bankruptcy. This collapse was triggered by Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of Binance, announcing that his exchange would be dumping its FTT Token holdings, amounting to around $2 billion. The bank run that followed this announcement opened up a web of lies and mismanagement that led to the eventual collapse of the exchange. The announcement caused a sharp decline in the price of FTT and generated concern among investors. As a result, traders hurriedly withdrew their funds from FTX, leading the company to confront a substantial $8 billion shortfall. To prevent a similar case like FTX bankruptcy, Youssef advised Paxful users to withdraw their funds until further investigation is conducted to uncover the truth behind the situation. By taking control of their own cryptocurrency assets, users can mitigate potential risks and ensure the security of their investments Related Reading: FTX Puts Sale Of $500 Million Stake In AI Firm Anthropic On Hold Youssef’s Concerns And Allegations Post-Departure From Paxful Trading on various P2P marketplaces, including Paxful, was temporarily suspended in early April due to regulatory reasons. When Paxful announced the resumption of services, Ray Youssef, who had already left the organization, expressed his uncertainty regarding the current state of affairs and emphasized his inability to vouch for anything happening within Paxful. Since he departed from the exchange, Youssef has been actively promoting Civkit, the platform he founded. While many of his followers have praised his efforts, accusations have labeled him an attention seeker. Additionally, some individuals have accused him of leveraging his influence to undermine competitors and rivals in the industry.

42393199,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgGxr5,1689076800,MetaMask Developer ConsenSys Brings Layer 2 Blockchain ‘Linea’ to Ethereum Mainnet,"Takeaways  ConsenSys is set to deploy Linea, its ZK-rollup network, to the main Ethereum network.  Linea uses zero-knowledge (ZK) cryptography to offer cheaper and faster blockchain transactions; ConsenSys says fee rates, known as gas prices, will be 15 times less on Linea than Ethereum.  ConsenSys says it does not currently have plans for a Linea token.  ConsenSys, the research and development firm behind the popular Metamask crypto wallet, plans to roll out its layer-2 network, Linea, to the main Ethereum network this week.  The so-called rollup network is known as a zkEVM, which means it relies on zero-knowledge (ZK) cryptography – one of this year’s hottest blockchain trends – and is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) programming environment, so existing Ethereum-based applications can be ported over without significant additional work. Rollups are seen as a critical element of the Ethereum blockchain’s roadmap, since they offer users cheaper and faster transactions compared with the often-congested parent network.  App developers will be able to deploy their projects to Linea’s “alpha” network on Friday, with the general public gaining access to it starting next week.  With the mainnet alpha launch, Linea joins a string of recent zkEVM projects vying to expand accessibility to Ethereum, the second-biggest blockchain by transaction volume. Rollup networks like Linea are expected to eventually become the primary method by which users access Ethereum, considered impractical for many users and use cases due to its high fees.  Read more: Ethereum’s Rollup Race: What is a ‘True’ zkEVM?  “Because the gas prices on the layer 2 are 15 times less than on layer 1, many use cases become possible,” Nicolas Liochon, the global product lead for Linea, told CoinDesk.  ConsenSys is led by Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin and builds some of the ecosystem’s core infrastructure, including MetaMask as well as Infura.  Emphasizing that ConsenSys remains “dedicated to Ethereum,” Liochon said that “by moving over activities to layer 2, we basically are able to increase, by multiple orders of magnitude, the number of people that will be able to use the network.”  The first Ethereum rollups to market, Optimism and Arbitrum, were so-called “optimistic” rollups – based on a slightly different technology that comes with the drawback of lengthy settlement times.  Newer ZK rollups like Linea work similarly – bundling up large groups of transactions and “settling” them in bulk to Ethereum’s ledger – but their developers are betting ZK cryptography will eventually make them speedier, cheaper, and more secure than optimistic alternatives.  Unlike some of its zkEVM competitors, ConsenSys opted to make its network bytecode-compatible with the EVM – a technical nuance that could theoretically make Linea easier to use with existing Ethereum developer tools.  According to ConsenSys, over 5 million unique wallets have already transacted on Linea’s test network, which went live in March and used NFTs and other hand-outs to incentivize new users.  Many existing layer 2 networks, like Arbitrum and Optimism, have “airdropped” tokens to early users after launching to the main Ethereum network. The tokens could be sold for a quick profit or used as votes to help govern updates to the protocol; dangling the prospect of an airdrop is seen as a way of encouraging users to try out new networks.  There has long been speculation that ConsenSys might eventually launch a token for Linea. While Liochon wouldn’t count out the possibility of a Linea token, he said that if it ever does arrive, it won’t be for a while.  “What do we want to do? Do we want to get rich quickly, or do we want to build something?” asked Liochion. “Yeah, basically, I think that we should build things.”  Ethereum's rollup landscape  Linea’s launch comes after zkSync and Polygon, the first two zkEVM networks to launch on Ethereum’s mainnet, released software development kits (SDKs) allowing coders to clone their code to spin up their own rollup networks.  ConsenSys says Linea will become fully open-source in the coming weeks, meaning developers will be able to freely use its code (though ConsenSys has no current plans to release an SDK).  Zero-knowledge rollup technology is new and still advancing. As Linea enters its alpha launch, it will still have certain points of centralization in its system – which Liochon refers to as “training wheels” – as a way to protect users from unforeseen bugs and other hiccups.  For now, ConsenSys will still be the only party allowed to submit zero-knowledge proofs to Linea’s smart contracts on Ethereum. In layman’s terms, this means the firm will act as a sort of transaction traffic cop for the time being – directing transactions and packaging them up into the bundles that it sends to Ethereum.  The strategy is similar to that taken by other Layer 2 teams, which have been similarly deliberate in their incremental steps toward full decentralization.  “If you're fully decentralized, basically the idea is that anyone can submit proofs,” said Liochon. “But you need to be 100% sure that there’s no issue in your proof system. We're not there yet.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | ZK,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/07/11/metamask-developer-consensys-brings-layer-2-blockchain-linea-to-ethereum-mainnet,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/039f883a809dde534be4a326579176c4601f0691-4000x2668.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42393211,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgGyGj,1689075913,"Marex Unveils Bitcoin, Ether-Linked Long Strategy With Dollar Index as Hedge","London-based financial services platform Marex has launched a volatility-adjusted strategy tied to bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and the dollar index (DXY) futures to cater to investors wary of the relatively high price turbulence in the crypto market.  Marex said the strategy is already being marketed to clients. Bitcoin and ether have equal weight in the strategy, with the DXY futures acting as a hedge.  The basket is consistently rebalanced between BTC, ETH, and DXY futures to target annualized volatility of 8%. When volatility rises, the strategy cuts exposure to risk assets – BTC, ETH – and increases exposure to DXY. When volatility falls, the basket rebalances toward BTC and ETH.  The strategy takes advantage of the DXY's safe-haven appeal and bitcoin and ether's tendency to behave like risk assets to keep the net volatility exposure of the portfolio as close to the target value as possible in all market environments.  ""This is the first institutional grade FX and crypto vol targeted strategy,"" Mark Arasaratnam, co-head of Digital Assets at Marex, said in an email. ""It's targeted to investors wanting to gain some exposure to crypto but are concerned about its volatility.""  Arasaratnam added that the DXY acts as a robust complement to the long-only portfolio from both a thematic and empirical perspective.  Per Marex's pitch deck, at the current level of volatility, the strategy would provide a 12% exposure to digital assets and the rest to the DXY futures.  While crypto propounders hail bitcoin as a safe haven asset, the empirical evidence suggests otherwise, with the top cryptocurrency chalking out major rallies during sustained weakness in the U.S. dollar. The dollar, meanwhile, remains a hedge against systematic uncertainty, acting as a haven during times of stress in both crypto and wider markets.  The two have had a persistent negative correlation over the past three years. Thus, the DXY component of the strategy ensures less volatility and lower drawdowns.  Research by Marex suggests the basket involving DXY as the hedge asset would have generated a return of 29% between Jan. 1, 2021, to June 30, 2023 (a period consisting of both bullish and bearish trends).

Multimillion Dollar Exploit Was Inside Job? The cross-chain bridge protocol Multichain has fallen victim to a multimillion-dollar exploit that Chainalysis believes is an inside job. The incident, which took place on July 6, 2023, involved unauthorized withdrawals of an unusually large scale and resulted in a staggering loss of around $130 million. The aftermath of this exploit has left the blockchain community stunned, as Multichain was once regarded as a promising cross-chain bridge protocol. However, with the suspicion of an inside job, questions arise regarding the integrity and security practices within the organization. Hacker Seized MPC Keys Chainalysis expressed its suspicions in its July 10th blog post calling the situation “a hack or rug pull by insiders.” This aligns with the prior claims made by blockchain security firm SlowMist, which also raised the possibility of internal involvement. The latter tweeted, “It appears that activity has stopped. However, with multiple bridges all being drained, this looks more like a hack or rug pull and less like a migration. Please do not use and revoke all permission related to Multichain.” Explaining the technical aspects of Multichain's smart contracts, Chainalysis highlighted their use of a multiparty computation (MPC) system, much like a multisignature wallet. The firm suggested that the attacker might have gained control of Multichain's MPC keys to orchestrate this exploit. While acknowledging the chance of external hackers obtaining the keys, experts and analysts are leaning toward an inside job or rug pull due to recent questionable incidents surrounding the protocol. Shady Incidents At Multichain One prominent example of these incidents happened toward the end of May, when the protocol’s CEO, “Zhaojun” went missing. There was immediate speculation that Chinese authorities had arrested him. Additionally, the platform suffered from delayed transactions and various technical problems, leading Binance to withdraw its support for several bridged tokens on July 7. As the investigation unfolds, blockchain analysts have uncovered further dubious token movements associated with Multichain. These abnormal outflows included draining token addresses across multiple chains through the Multichain executor address. Furthermore, on July 8, stablecoin issuers Circle and Tether took swift action by freezing over $65 million in assets linked to the Multichain exploit. Also, the fact that the exploiter did not bother swapping out the centrally controlled assets like USDC, which can be easily frozen by the issuing company, just adds to the dubious nature of the entire situation.

Aave is a lending and borrowing platform that allows users to earn yields on their pledged tokens. Gho can be minted by users against a diversified set of crypto assets. GHO holders will continue to earn interest on the supplied collateral, just as in other lending transactions on Aave, which means ghost in Finnish.  The proposal seeks to introduce GHO through so-called ""facilitators,"" allowing users of Aave version 3 (V3) to mint GHO against token holdings supplied to the platform.  ""If approved, the introduction of GHO would make stablecoin borrowing on the Aave Protocol more competitive and generate additional revenue for the Aave DAO by providing to the DAO treasury 100% of the interest payments made on GHO borrows,"" the proposal states.  Gho has been available on the Ethereum blockchain’s Goerli testnet since February, where it has functioned without encountering any major bugs.  In a governance post in early June, developer Aave Companies proposed the V3 Ethereum Facilitator – to allow for gho lending against collateral deposits – and the FlashMinter Facilitator – a variant of flash loans, or loans that are issued against zero collateral.  These facilitators, which can be protocols or entities, have the ability to generate and burn GHO tokens up to a certain limit, enabling depositors to borrow GHO against their collateral deposited in Aave V3's Ethereum mainnet pool.  After launch, Aave will allow users to mint GHO tokens against their supplied collaterals. GHO would be backed by a basket of cryptocurrencies chosen at the users’ discretion, while borrowers would continue earning interest on their underlying collateral.

14766987,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=542074,1689073241,"Standard Chartered Raises Bitcoin Forecast To $120,000, Citing Miners’ Reduced Selling","Standard Chartered, one of the world’s leading banks, has raised its long-term Bitcoin price forecast, predicting that the value of the flagship cryptocurrency could reach $120,000 by the end of 2024. This upward revision comes as the bank acknowledges the potential for miners to hold a larger share of the newly minted Bitcoin supply. With the recent surge in Bitcoin’s price, Standard Chartered sees an opportunity for miners to reduce their selling activities, which could have implications for the cryptocurrency’s scarcity and future value. Miners’ Role In Bitcoin Value Proposition Miners hold a significant position within the crypto ecosystem, as they are responsible for the creation and upkeep of the network. And Standard Chartered’s forecast of Bitcoin reaching $120,000 by the end of 2024 is rooted in the notion that miners may adapt their selling practices to cover operational expenses, particularly the costs of electricity required for mining activities. Related Reading: Standard Chartered Predicts Bitcoin Could Reach $100,000 By End of 2024 By reducing the portion of newly generated Bitcoins they sell, miners can balance their cash inflows while simultaneously decreasing the overall supply of Bitcoin available in the market. This adjustment in selling behavior has the potential to impact the supply-demand dynamics of Bitcoin and potentially contribute to a surge in its value. The rationale behind Standard Chartered’s prediction lies in the assumption that miners, who currently produce approximately 900 new BTC daily on a global scale, will opt to hold onto a larger portion of their newly minted coins. By doing so, they can cover their operational costs more efficiently. If this adjustment occurs and the proportion of BTC sold by miners decreases, it could lead to a reduction in the net supply of Bitcoin by roughly 250,000 BTC per year. Such a decrease in supply has the potential to exert upward pressure on the value of Bitcoin as demand potentially outpaces the available coins in circulation. Factors Driving Standard Chartered’s Optimism Standard Chartered’s revised forecast is underpinned by the expectation that increased profitability for miners per Bitcoin mined will encourage them to hold onto a larger portion of their newly minted supply. Geoff Kendrick, a top FX analyst at the bank, suggests that as Bitcoin’s price approaches the $50,000 threshold, miners may reduce the proportion of BTC they sell from 100% to approximately 20-30%. This reduction in daily supply, from 900 BTC to a range of 180-270, would equate to a significant reduction in net BTC supply of roughly 250,000 BTC per year. Furthermore, Kendrick points to an upcoming event that will halve the number of BTC that can be mined each day, which is an intrinsic feature of Bitcoin’s design. This mechanism, known as the “halving,” gradually limits the supply of new BTC to maintain scarcity and mitigate inflation. Related Reading: Dormant Bitcoin Supply Peaks As Institutional Investors Show Increased Involvement By combining the potential reduction in miner selling with the forthcoming halving, Standard Chartered anticipates an environment conducive to a sustained increase in Bitcoin’s price over the long term. Meanwhile, over the past day, Bitcoin has traded below the $31,000 level particularly, with a market price of $30,441, at the time of writing. Nevertheless, the asset is seeing 1% gains in the last 24 hours with a 24-hour trading volume of $10.6 billion.

The relaxation will in the first instance operate for a period of up to five years, and would apply as a minimum to digital equities, bonds and money market instruments – but not to derivatives, or to unbacked crypto, such as bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), as officials point to an evolving regulatory framework.  Last year, Rishi Sunak, then finance minister and now prime minister, said he wanted to make the U.K. a cryptoasset hub. Proposals have followed on stablecoins, crypto promotions and a digital pound which would potentially be issued by the Bank of England – but the industry has complained ministers aren’t acting fast enough compared to rival jurisdictions.  The EU’s landmark Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation is set to take effect next year, and a pilot project to test out DLT securities trading is already in effect.  The Treasury is seeking views on its plans for a digital securities sandbox between now and August 22.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/07/11/uk-treasury-starts-consultations-on-five-year-digital-securities-trial,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/57391912dd6abf276130bf0bcfa15f14dc4d7b36-800x523.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Pikamoon would launch the world’s most immersive metaverse game and a first-of-its-kind earning model that allows players to withdraw their in-game rewards directly to their wallet or bank account without the need for a third party. Pikamoon focuses on becoming the most realistic metaverse game where players can get a 360-degree experience of the growing virtual space through unparalleled gameplay, stunning visuals, and innovative DeFi features. Drawing inspiration from legendary games like Fortnite, Pokemon, and FIFA, the Ethereum game has leaped forward and is prepared to blend NFTs, video gaming, and metaverse entertainment perfectly. The Pikamoon game is built on Unity, the world’s most advanced game development technology, to create the stunning visuals and architecture needed to give players a truly immersive experience. Additionally, Pikamoon is built across two blockchains: Ethereum and MultiversX (formerly Elrond). While Ethereum provides scalability, MultiversX complements it by providing efficiency and ensuring the game is environmentally friendly by reducing carbon emissions generated by transactions. This dual blockchain feature ensures that the Pikamoon ecosystem can cater to legions of gamers without any lag. Gaming enthusiasts and smart investors are convinced Pikamoon is the future of gaming, and this is evident in how fast phase one and phase two of the ICO sold out. In the first phase, one PIKA sold for $0.0002, which increased to $0.0004 in the second phase, and now in the third and last phase, one PIKA is selling for $0.0006 and selling out faster. Notable partners of this Ethereum-based game include future-thinking Web3 brands such as Ethereum, Transak, Cryptonews.com, Kevuru Games, and MultiversX. This line-up of industry leaders further reinforces the credibility of the project, reaffirming the fact that the team is committed to building the best of the best gaming projects. Pikamoon offers investors the opportunity to enter what is strategically seen as a huge market of the Metaverse and gaming on the Ethereum blockchain. A core feature of the PIKA token is its deflationary nature. Whenever a sell or transfer transaction occurs in the Pikamoon ecosystem, 0.5% of the tokens involved in the transaction are burned forever, translating into more profits for long-term investors. The much-talked-about presale, which is still on, uses Ethereum as its base currency, becoming the new favorite of the Ethereum community. This seamless integration with Ethereum not only simplifies the investment process for eager investors but also strengthens the overall Ethereum ecosystem. About Pikamoon Pikamoon makes metaverse gameplay exciting and rewarding for players of all age groups. The Pikamoon’s metaverse, the Pikaverse, offers players endless opportunities to explore, battle, trade, and earn a living within the game. It operates on two blockchains, Ethereum and MultiversX, ensuring smooth and glitch-free gameplay for every player.

14765464,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=542094,1689069642,Microstrategy Stock Surges 7% As Berenberg Highlights Bitcoin Halving’s Impact,"Hamburg-based Berenberg Capital Markets recently highlighted the upcoming Bitcoin halving event as a potential trigger for the bullish case of Microstrategy, a United States-based software firm, in a recent research note. The research note emphasized that Microstrategy, with a bullish price target of $430, primarily derives its value from its substantial holdings of over 150,000 BTC. And Berenberg expects the historical trend of Bitcoin rallying after each halving to repeat. Halving Events And Bitcoin’s Market Impact Halving events are significant occurrences in the Bitcoin network that happen approximately every four years. During these events, the rate of new coin issuance is reduced by 50%, resulting in a slower influx of new Bitcoins into the market. The upcoming fourth Bitcoin halving, scheduled for April 26, 2024, is expected to follow this pattern. Related Reading: Michael Saylor Doubles Down On Bitcoin, Adds 12,333 BTC To MicroStrategy’s Holdings Berenberg’s recent research note highlighted the historical trend observed in the previous three halvings and suggested that a pre-halving rally could potentially commence in about four months. If this rally follows a similar trajectory to previous halvings. It could persist until approximately October 2025, according to the research note. Berenberg noted: If the historical pattern established by the first three Bitcoin halvings continues to play out with the fourth halving, then the pre-halving rally would begin about four months from now. If a rally were to occur after the fourth halving, and if it were as long-lived as the rallies that occurred after the past couple of halvings, then it would continue until around October 2025. Correlation Between Bitcoin And Microstrategy’s Stock According to the research note, there is a strong correlation between Microstrategy’s stock price and the price of Bitcoin, estimated to be around 0.90. If the fourth bitcoin halving triggers a significant rally in the price of the cryptocurrency, it is likely that Microstrategy’s stock will follow suit. This forecast is due to the positive outlook for Bitcoin’s post-halving performance contributing to the anticipation of a potential rally in Microstrategy’s stock price. Following the release of Berenberg’s research note, Microstrategy’s stock, with the ticker symbol MSTR, has already witnessed a notable surge of 7% in the past day. The stock, which was trading below its current price range in the previous month, is now valued at $407. The market’s positive response reflects the optimism surrounding the potential impact of the upcoming Bitcoin halving event on Microstrategy’s performance. Furthermore, it is worth noting that the concept of halving has since been associated with significant market movements in the past. And investors closely monitor these events for potential opportunities. Related Reading: MicroStrategy Bought Bitcoin To Avoid Liquidation, Peter Schiff Reveals The reduction in new coin issuance, combined with market demand, has historically contributed to price appreciation in Bitcoin.

And, consequently, on companies like Microstrategy, which holds a substantial amount of Bitcoin on its balance sheet.

However, despite this notable increase, it failed to ward off the sellers who swiftly entered the market. Can Dogecoin regain its momentum and rise again, or will it succumb to the mounting pressure from the bearish sentiment? Bitcoin (BTC) also experienced a downturn in the previous week, and this negative trend had a noticeable impact on the sentiment surrounding Dogecoin. Unfortunately, the figures did not provide a strong basis for a potential recovery in DOGE. Instead, it indicated a looming decline towards the price range of $0.053 and $0.048. DOGE Bearish Indicators Emerge The current DOGE price on CoinGecko stands at $0.0652, experiencing a modest 0.7% rally within the past 24 hours. However, it is important to note that a decline of 5.8% has been recorded over the course of the past seven days. Source: Coingecko This price movement has prompted a closer examination of the market conditions, revealing some bearish signals and underlying trends.

DOGE market cap back at $9 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Additionally, the On-Balance Volume (OBV) has been unable to surpass a resistance level since May, reflecting a lack of interest from buyers.

Related Reading: PEPE Potential Rebound: Key Details You Shouldn’t Miss Although some buyers noticed the recent short-term rally and made purchases as prices slowly edged higher, it is worth noting that this rally pales in comparison to the significant surge the meme coin experienced in early April, when Dogecoin reached the $0.1 level. DOGE seven-day price action. Source: Coingecko. This discrepancy, referring to the difference between the current rally and previous ones, implies that the present market upswing may be lacking an equivalent degree of enthusiasm and support from buyers. This observation raises questions about the sustainability and strength of the crypto. Outlook For DOGE The bearish signals observed, such as the RSI dropping below the neutral 50 level and the lack of conviction from buyers indicated by the OBV, suggest a challenging road ahead for DOGE. These factors may contribute to increased selling pressure and further price declines. Considering the current market conditions, it is important to approach the outlook for DOGE with caution. The short-term rally, although relatively subdued compared to past performances, could still offer opportunities for traders looking for quick gains. However, it is vital to remain vigilant and closely monitor the market dynamics. (This site’s content should not be construed as investment advice. Investing involves risk.

14765367,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/07/former-sec-chair-says-spot-bitcoin-etf-should-be-approved,1689069399,Former SEC Chair says Spot Bitcoin ETF should be approved,"Jay Clayton, former Head of the SEC, says that there are now no reasons why a Spot Bitcoin ETF should not be approved. The ex-chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission was interviewed on CNBC Squawk Box on Monday and gave his views on the long-running saga of the SEC and Spot Bitcoin ETFs. In order to give the whole picture of ETFs for Bitcoin, Clayton started by giving his thoughts on the first Bitcoin ETF filings back in 2015/16, when he believed that things were very different to what they are today. He mused on his thoughts at that time: “This is an offshore, retail, nothing close to what I would say the core of our financial markets. At that time, if you look at trading of bitcoin, the emergence of bitcoin, it looked like stocks, but it was not anything like it.” However, since that time, he admitted that things had changed drastically to the point that blue chip companies such as Blackrock were willing to back it. He commented: “companies whose reputation in the market matters are saying ‘you know what, we think that trading, we think that the custody, we think that those protections around this market are sufficient, that we are willing to put our name on it’” In Clayton’s view this was an “incredible development” and not one that he had expected. He had always been “sceptical” of bitcoin and said that studies had showed “90% wash trading, manipulation” and people “dumping”. However, for him, what had really changed was when companies that “know the markets better than anybody” had moved into the space and had said that they are “willing to put their reputation behind it”. On being asked if he thought that a Spot ETF should now be approved, Clayton said that when a Futures ETF had been approved, the protections for the investor had been in place, but this hadn’t been the case for a Spot ETF. Now though, he says that institutions have been arguing that the protections for a Spot ETF are there, and that it is actually “more efficient and less drag” for the investor than the Futures ETF. When pressed on when he thought a Spot ETF might be approved, Clayton said that it would need to go through the regulatory process but if it was proved to have “similar efficacy” to a Futures ETF then it would be “hard to resist approval”.

In 2021, the Chinese State Council implemented its strictest crypto trading and mining ban to date, forcing out all Bitcoin, Ethereum, and crypto miners. Hong Kong has taken a different approach by recently adopting a new crypto licensing regime that will allow the trading of established cryptocurrencies. China recently published a white paper highlighting the government's commitment to fostering innovation in the web3 market. This article was originally published for members of Beat Billions. Price data was updated on July 10. As some of you know, I have mixed views about cryptocurrencies. I am generally bullish on cryptocurrencies but at the same time, I have no clarity as to which individual cryptocurrency will go on to make it big. For now, investors wanting to gain exposure to this technology might have to settle for Bitcoin (BTC-USD), which is the largest cryptocurrency today. I consider Coinbase Global, Inc. ( COIN ) stock as a reliable alternative to cryptos to gain exposure to digital assets since the company can thrive in the long run regardless of which cryptocurrency makes it big. Although I am more of a long-term stock investor and less of a trader who tries to make the most of short-term macroeconomic developments, I believe there is no harm in following such trends to see whether an opportunity will come my way. After monitoring some recent developments in China - a country that has gone to extreme lengths to curb the adoption of this technology - I have a feeling that crypto prices may surprisingly benefit from favorable policy decisions in China. China's Changing Stance On Cryptocurrencies China has had a tumultuous relationship with cryptocurrencies, frequently cracking down on them. During the crypto bull market in 2017, Chinese authorities took action against crypto trading, particularly focusing on Initial Coin Offerings. The trading of digital assets is prone to scams due to a lack of regulation. To address the growing concerns surrounding cryptocurrencies, China implemented a ban on all platforms offering them, requiring exchanges to refund investors' money. In 2021, the Chinese State Council implemented its strictest crypto trading and mining ban to date, forcing out all Bitcoin, Ethereum, and crypto miners. The ban resulted in more than a 50% drop in Bitcoin's network hash rate and a significant decline in Bitcoin price in the subsequent months. Bitcoin price chart Data by YCharts In addition to the ban on Bitcoin mining, Chinese regulatory bodies outlawed all crypto trading and transactions, making it illegal for residents to send or receive cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, China actively pursued the development of an official Central Bank Digital Currency, known as the ""digital yuan,"" and cities like Shanghai committed substantial investments to national metaverse projects. On the other hand, Hong Kong has taken a different approach by recently adopting a new crypto licensing regime that will allow the trading of established cryptocurrencies starting from June 1. The move requires trading platforms and exchanges to obtain licenses or face fines and jail terms. The Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong has stated that the majority of respondents agreed to the proposal to allow licensed trading platform operators to serve retail investors. The Commission plans to implement measures to protect investors, including ensuring suitability in the onboarding process, good governance, enhanced token due diligence, admission criteria, and disclosures. This change in Hong Kong's regulatory landscape suggests a willingness to embrace the potential benefits of cryptocurrencies. I believe China will use Hong Kong as a testing ground to see what works and develop a path for the country to gradually open up to cryptocurrencies in the coming years. China's Web3 Innovation and Development White Paper China's release of the ""Web3 Innovation and Development White Paper (2023)"" signifies the government's focus on fostering innovation and development within the web3 industry. The white paper identifies key research areas, such as Artificial Intelligence, XR interactive terminals, and content production tools. It acknowledges the rapid growth of emerging applications like digital populations and collections. However, the paper also highlights the challenges in terms of technology and talent support capabilities, industrial chain integrity, and legal norms. To address these challenges, the Beijing Municipal Science & Technology Commission plans to allocate significant funding to drive innovation in the web3 industry. Yang Hongfu, the director of the Zhongguancun Chaoyang Park management committee, revealed that the Chaoyang district of the city has committed to allocating a minimum of 100 million yuan ($14 million) per year until 2025 for this cause. This investment pledge underscores the pivotal role of Zhongguancun, often referred to as China's Silicon Valley, in propelling this ambitious initiative forward. The release of the white paper, alongside the changing crypto regulations in Hong Kong, has sparked reactions and speculation about China's shifting perspective on cryptocurrencies. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao expressed intrigue, noting that historically, similar coverage by China Central Television has been associated with heightened market activity and price surges. The CCTV recently featured a Bitcoin ATM in Hong Kong, with a conspicuous blue Bitcoin logo and the option to ""Buy Bitcoins,"" suggesting a potential change in China's stance. Despite China's past crackdown on digital assets, the digital assets market has shown resilience. Bitcoin, which experienced a significant shock due to the mining ban more than two years ago, has rebounded but continues to trade around $30,000, weighed down by macroeconomic factors. The recent positive risk sentiment resulting from the debt-ceiling deal in the United States has contributed to an improvement in the market sentiment toward cryptocurrencies, and Bitcoin has gained just over 10% since publishing this article to Beat Billions members. What Does China's Changing Stance Mean To Crypto Markets? The ban imposed by China in 2021 had a notable impact on the global crypto industry, however, the ban did not entirely halt crypto-related activities within China. Underground crypto markets emerged as enthusiasts sought ways to circumvent the regulations. The crackdown was part of a broader effort to regulate the fintech sector and aligned with China's ambitions to introduce its own digital currency, the digital yuan. The indication of a potential shift in China's approach to cryptocurrency regulation is a significant development. Market participants are closely monitoring the signs of a possible shift in China's position, although the specifics and implications of this potential change remain uncertain. If China were to lift its ban on cryptocurrencies, it would undoubtedly have a substantial impact on the global crypto market as it was once the world's dominant Bitcoin mining hub. China's potential acceptance of cryptocurrencies could stimulate global demand, drive up prices, and potentially contribute to wider acceptance of digital currencies. Takeaway China's evolving stance on cryptocurrencies, as reflected in the release of a white paper and changing crypto regulations in Hong Kong, has sparked speculation about the potential for a new Bitcoin bull run.

The report from BIS, a grouping of the world’s major central banks, cited issues of instability, inefficiency and accountability that outweigh potential innovative benefits such as automated payments.  Despite the millions of retail and institutional investors getting involved in the growing sector, “crypto has so far failed to harness innovation to the benefit of society,” said the report, prepared for a meeting of G20 finance ministers and central bank governors due to take place in Gandhinagar, India this weekend.  “Crypto remains largely self-referential and does not finance real economic activity,” it added. “Inherent structural flaws make it unsuitable to play a significant role in the monetary system.”  The report comes after a turbulent year for crypto. The report cites the losses from the collapses of FTX and of the Terra ecosystem, the risk of hacks and rug pulls and the problems of scaling to become the size a full-on payment system will need – since, it said, permissionless blockchains that grow too large get congested.  Central bankers’ skepticism about crypto is nothing new, given fears that new payment systems could disrupt or displace the traditional fiat currencies they issue.  Members of the G20 appear to be cautious about encouraging stablecoins, cryptocurrencies tied to the value of fiat currencies, since the effect on centralized monetary policy can be even more pronounced in emerging markets.

The collaboration will see the next Starbucks Odyssey Journey feature a stamp “designed by Aku” and a donation to a non-profit. The Starbucks-Aku Collaboration Starbucks has collaborated with the Aku NFT collection for its next digital collectible Stamp, available on its dedicated Discord channel. The Aku NFT collection was created by former Major League Baseball player Micah Johnson and focuses on empowering young kids to dream big and pursue their dreams. The collection has attracted interest from several high-profile celebrities, with NFTs from the collection having been purchased by Pusha T, Trevor Noah, and Tyra Banks. Micah Johnson thanked Starbucks for their support, tweeting on his official Twitter handle, “I’m extremely grateful to @Starbucks for supporting our mission to not just be a character that represents good but a character that actually does good.” The New Journey Starbucks plans to launch the new Journey on the 17th of July. The new Journey, called “Aku Adventure,” will allow Odyssey members to “embark on a new mission with Aku.” A post on the Discord channel states that the new Stamp has been “designed by Aku,” and the Journey will be available exclusively to Odyssey members until the 13th of August, 2023. Additionally, as part of the launch, Starbucks has also announced that it would be donating $100,000 to Blessings in a Backpack, a non-profit dedicated to addressing food insecurity among children. The Odyssey Program Starbucks had launched its highly anticipated Odyssey program in December 2022, combining customer loyalty rewards with NFTs and other gamified elements. The Web3 extension of the hugely popular Starbucks Rewards Program was opened to a select group of waitlist members which included customers and existing employees. Those joining the program could engage in interactive “Journeys” and earn “Journey Stamps,” which came in the form of Polygon-based NFTs. Users could also collect Odyssey Points and gain access to new benefits and experiences in the future. At the time of launch, the company had released a statement which said, “Starbucks Odyssey is an experience surrounded by a digital community where members can come together, interact, and share their love of coffee. Starbucks is using meaningful elements of Web3 technology to reward members in innovative ways.” The company has been rolling out limited-edition NFTs to the members of the invitation-only Odyssey loyalty program for a considerable amount of time. Back in March, the company announced the release of “The Siren Collection,” which offered 2000 Stamps, each priced at $100. The Siren Collection saw staggering demand, with collectors complaining of a wave of technical glitches and long wait times. More recently, Starbucks launched the “Starbucks First Store Collection.” The collection consisted of 5000 stamps, each priced at $99. This launch had a far smoother launch than the Siren Collection. CMO Bradley Brewer stated that Starbucks wanted to invest in blockchain for a considerable amount of time but was waiting for a concrete way of using the technology to help expand its business and loyalty program. According to Brewer, the company wanted to make NFTs the gateway to the digital community but obscured the exact nature of the technology to bring more users to the Web3 platform. “It happens to be built on blockchain and web3 technologies, but the customer — to be honest — may very well not even know that what they’re doing is interacting with blockchain technology. It’s just the enabler.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

A lawyer for Grayscale Investments sent a letter to a US Circuit Court, questioning the SEC’s refusal to allow Grayscale’s Bitcoin ETF (exchange-traded fund) to trade. On Monday, Donald B Verilli, Jnr. sent a letter to Judge Mark Langer of the US Court of Appeals, pointing out that the US SEC has allowed Volatility Shares’ 2X Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITX) to trade. Today, our attorneys filed a letter with the DC Circuit highlighting the disparity between the SEC’s approval of a leveraged #bitcoin futures ETF while continuing to deny approval of spot bitcoin ETFs like $GBTC. Let’s dive deeper. 🧵/6 pic.twitter.com/z7WyGBthhT — Grayscale (@Grayscale) July 10, 2023 Grayscale Applies for Spot Bitcoin ETF Verilli’s questions come after Grayscale applied to convert its spot Bitcoin Trust into a spot Bitcoin ETF, to which the SEC answered no. Grayscale believes that BITX is a riskier product than the one regulators refuse to approve and poses the question about the rationality behind allowing the trade of a riskier product but refusing the trade of a safer one. Grayscale Questions Why Riskier Products Receive Regulatory Approval In the letter, Verilli argued: It exposes investors to an even riskier investment product than the traditional bitcoin futures exchange-traded products . . . which encompass risks related to both the futures and spot bitcoin markets. He noted that the 2X Bitcoin Strategy ETF seeks to double the performance of the S&P CME Bitcoin Futures Daily Roll Index every day and highlighted that it is leveraged. Verilli further quoted BITX’s registration statement, which clarifies that the product may lead to massive losses if left in the hands of those who do not have enough knowledge about it. In its stamen, BITX’s conceded its product is suitable for “knowledgeable investors.” Verilli also argued that approving the Volatility Shares ETF contradicts the SEC’s view against any fund dealing with the spot market. He wrote: The fact that the Commission has allowed a leveraged bitcoin futures ETP to begin trading demonstrates that the Commission continues to arbitrarily treat spot Bitcoin ETPs differently than bitcoin futures ETPs. SEC’s Arguments Lack Consistency The SEC’s refusal of Grayscale’s application rested on the argument it lacked an appropriate plan to monitor the impact on spot prices stemming from fraud and market manipulation. Grayscale rejected the SEC’s statement by saying futures prices themselves are drawn from spot markets. The SEC’s rejection of the Volatility Shares ETF shows the agency’s inconsistency. Verilli argued in his letter that by dealing with futures markets using leverage to achieve larger returns, the fund exposes investors to higher risk than a spot or traditional ETF would. Mr Verilli claims his argument should invalidate the SEC’s reason for rejecting Grayscale’s filing. Verilli stated: While the commission could theoretically correct its discriminatory treatment of spot bitcoin ETPs by rescinding its approval of all Bitcoin-based ETPs, the Commission’s apparent willingness to permit even a leveraged bitcoin futures ETP—a particularly high-risk version of a Bitcoin futures product—makes clear [it] has no intention of doing so.

14763598,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=542088,1689065431,Bitcoin At Mid-Cycle Point: Historical Pattern Repeating Itself?,"Bitcoin has reached a critical juncture in its current market cycle, according to a recent analysis conducted by on-chain analytics firm Glassnode. The data reveals striking similarities to historical patterns, raising questions about the potential emergence of a familiar phenomenon: the re-accumulation period. A Resilient Market: Bitcoin Holds Firm At Mid-Cycle The Glassnode analysis reveals that Bitcoin is consolidating around the $30,000 mark, which acts as a significant mid-point within the 2021-2023 cycle. The historical significance of this level is not to be overlooked, as it has been tested repeatedly in previous cycles. Remarkably, the mid-cycle phenomenon is not exclusive to the current cycle; similar mid-cycle points were observed in both 2013-2016 and 2018-2019, displaying analogous supply dynamics. As Bitcoin currently hovers around the $30,000 mid-point, approximately 75% of the total supply is currently held in a profitable state, while the remaining 25% remains in a loss position. This balance of supply held in profit versus loss is reminiscent of equilibrium points witnessed during previous cycles, indicating a potential re-accumulation period. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hash Rate Retakes All-Time High As Miners Continue To Expand Capacity As Glassnode explains, “This 75:25 balance of supply held in profit:loss is the equilibrium point for Bitcoin. 50% of all trading days have seen a higher Profit-to-Loss balance, and 50% a lower one.” Such equilibrium points have historically required time for the market to digest and re-consolidate around, often accompanied by a period of sideways trading and volatility. This has become known as the “re-accumulation period.” At the moment, The supply held “in-loss” has declined to just 4.79 million BTC, reaching similar levels seen in July 2021 ($30k), July 2020 ($9.2k), April 2016 ($6.5k), and March 2016 ($425). Robust Recovery And Historical Comparisons According to Glassnode, Bitcoin’s price performance in 2023 has demonstrated remarkable resilience, with a maximum drawdown of only -18% thus far, a shallow correction compared to previous cycles. This suggests a substantial underlying demand for the asset and indicates a potential strong degree of investor support. Related Reading: Bitcoin Google Search Interest Stands At Critical Level, What This Forecast For BTC Glassnode’s analysis further highlights the similarities between the current recovery rally and those observed in prior cycles. Historically, recovery rallies following a similar magnitude move off the cycle’s bottom often marked the genesis of a new cyclical uptrend. While exceptions exist, the parallels between the current recovery and those of the past offer an intriguing possibility for Bitcoin’s future trajectory. The report notes, “With the exception of 2019, all prior cycles which experienced a similar magnitude move off the bottom were, in fact, the genesis point of a new cyclical uptrend.” Remarkably, previous re-accumulation periods were characterized by a lack of macro market direction and tending to trade sideways. “With the market back at this equilibrium point, it remains to be seen if a similarly lengthy and choppy process is needed to overcome it,” concludes Glassnode. The Takeaway: Will History Repeat For BTC? Glassnode’s analysis unveils a fascinating narrative within Bitcoin’s ongoing market cycle. The emergence of the mid-cycle point and the familiar supply dynamics indicate that historical patterns are repeating themselves. While no crystal ball can predict the future with certainty, these insights offer intriguing possibilities for Bitcoin’s trajectory. At press time, the BTC price was at $30,626 and remained in the trading range of the last two weeks.

However, as the initial excitement surrounding ETFs subsided, Bitcoin (BTC) experienced a period of fluctuation. Notably, during this time, PEPE has been gradually making lower highs. Amidst these fluctuations, it becomes essential to examine the underlying factors that have contributed to the declining trend in PEPE’s price perfomance. Are there external market forces at play, or is it indicative of a broader shift in the cryptocurrency landscape? Additionally, how will this development impact the future trajectory of PEPE and other cryptocurrencies? PEPE Price Performance: From Highs To Fluctuations PEPE recently reached a new high of $0.00000190. However, its current price on CoinGecko stands at $0.00000152, reflecting a modest 4.3% rally in the past 24 hours. Nevertheless, over the course of the last seven days, PEPE has experienced a significant decline of 13%. Source: Coingecko Technical indicators further emphasize the shift in PEPE’s price trajectory. A PEPE price report highlights that various indicators have flashed sell signals. Notably, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has made lower highs, indicating a decline in buying pressure over the past few days. Total market cap of cryptocurrencies currently at $1.16 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Moreover, the On Balance Volume has eased, suggesting a decrease in demand, while the Average Directional Index (ADX) has dropped below 20, indicating a lack of a strong trend for PEPE. These technical signals hint at the challenges PEPE has faced in the face of its recent fluctuations. Altcoins’ Massive Pullbacks Amidst Bitcoin’s Extended Consolidation Meanwhile, Bitcoin (BTC) has entered a phase of extended consolidation, with its price fluctuating above the $30,000 mark for nearly two weeks. This prolonged period of stability, coupled with intermittent fluctuations, has had a cascading effect on the broader cryptocurrency market, leading to significant pullbacks in most altcoins, including PEPE. Related Reading: Litecoin (LTC) Price Weakens Below $100 As Bears Extend Their Grip BTC’s status as the leading cryptocurrency makes its price movements a crucial factor influencing the market sentiment and performance of other digital assets. When Bitcoin experiences extended consolidation, investors and traders often exercise caution and become more hesitant to make significant moves. PEPE seven-day price action. Source: Coingecko As a result, altcoins, which rely on BTC’s stability and positive market sentiment, tend to be more susceptible to pullbacks and corrections.

14761810,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/07/us-lawmakers-call-on-sec-doj-to-investigate-prometheum,1689061500,"US Lawmakers Call On SEC, DOJ To Investigate Prometheum","Six members of the United States Congress have called on the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to investigate crypto firm Prometheum. The members have alleged that the firm has close ties with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Republicans Step Up Attack On Prometheum The Republican members of Congress stated that the firm’s co-CEO, Aaron Kaplan, may have potentially given false testimony during a Jun. 13 hearing on regulatory clarity in the crypto space. They also alleged that the company may have violated securities laws. The lawmakers stated in a letter written on Jul. 10, stating, “We write to express great concern that Prometheum Inc. (Prometheum) may have provided false testimony to Congress or violated United States securities laws.” The lawmakers further claimed that Prometheum was connected with investors that had close ties with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), the Shanghai Wanxiang Blockchain and HashKey Digital Asset Group. The group of lawmakers, led by Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville, called on Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler and Attorney General Merrick Garland to look into the matter. Apart from Tuberville, the letter was signed by Laine Luetkemeyer, R-Miss., Barry Loudermilk, R-Ga., Ralph Norman, R-S.C., Byron Donalds, R-Flor., and Mark Alford, R-Missouri. What Did Kaplan Say? On Jun. 13, Kaplan, the co-founder, and co-CEO of Prometheum, appeared before the US House to discuss regulatory clarity in the crypto space. During the hearing, Kaplan had argued that multiple frameworks put out by the Securities and Exchange Commission had laid out a clear path for crypto firms operating in the United States. Kaplan went so far as to call the Securities and Exchange Commission “the most capable financial markets regulatory agency in the world.” However, what caught the attention of Republican lawmakers were allegations that the company had links with the Chinese Communist Party. Tuberville alleged that Kaplan, during his testimony, had said that Prometheum was developed independently of Wanxiang and HashKey. Kaplan stated in his testimony, ""In December 2018, as part of the investment from Hashkey into Prometheum, Prometheum, and Wanxiang agreed to jointly develop a blockchain trading system. Thereafter, in approximately one (1) year, it became clear to Prometheum that joint development was not viable. Upon such realization, Prometheum started to independently develop its own platform. All servers, code, data, and proprietary technology were created independently of Wanxiang and its affiliates. Prometheum does not use any resource, code, or other assets from Wanxiang or its affiliates in any of its systems."" According to Kaplan, Prometheum terminated all strategic relationships with Shanghai Wanxiang Blockchain in October 2021. “Prometheum formally terminated all co-development work and strategic relationships with Shanghai Wanxiang Blockchain and its affiliates in October 2021 in an Omnibus Agreement, which was filed with the SEC in November 2021.” However, lawmakers alleged that this contradicted the information that the firm had provided in filings with the SEC, stating that Prometheum still relied on the HashKey partnership, as shown by the SEC filings from 2020-2021. Furthermore, they questioned why Prometheum did not make clear in the filings that the company was developing its own technology platform, entirely independent of its Chinese partners. The senators have yet to give the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice a deadline to respond but have said they hope to hear from them soon. Prometheum Responds While Kaplan has not commented on the developments so far, a Jun. 23 op-ed by Kaplan and co-CEO Benjamin Kaplan has claimed that Tuberville’s concerns regarding Prometheum and its alleged ties to China were without merit and relied on old information. “We formally terminated all co-development work and strategic relationships with Wanxiang and its affiliates on Oct. 21, 2021. Prometheum has severed all intellectual property and technology ties to Wanxiang, giving it and its affiliates no access to any information that could expose the U.S. or its citizens to risk.” Concerns About China Republican lawyers have consistently raised concerns about companies having ties with China-based entities or its government when it came to laws and regulations regarding digital assets. Minnesota Rep Tom Emmer and Former Senator Pat Toomey had issued warnings about the use of China’s Digital Yuan during the Beijing Winter Olympics. The current letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice comes a month after Tuberville brought forward a bill to ban companies from China from acquiring a stake in American digital asset companies.

Activity in Bitcoin Ordinals NFTs, a method of generating Bitcoin non-fungible tokens (NFTs) through a process called inscribing, has picked up in the wake of the BRC-69 token standard launch.  The number of new inscriptions rose to over 350,000 on Monday, according to data tracked by blockchain analytics firm Glassnode.  The daily tally has surged by over 250% since Ordinals launchpad Luminex unveiled the Bitcoin Request for Comment (BRC)-69 token standard on July 3. The modified version of the BRC-20 standard was launched to reduce the cost of inscriptions for Ordinals by over 90%.  ""With BRC69, we can reduce the costs of inscriptions for Ordinals collections by over 90%. This reduction is achieved through a 4-step process: (1) inscribe traits, (2) deploy collection, (3) compile collection, and (4) mint assets,"" Luminex said in a Tweet thread.  ""The brilliance of BRC69 lies in its simplicity. Minters only need to inscribe a single line of text instead of a full image. This text allows the final image to be automatically rendered on all ordinals-frontends, using solely on-chain resources, thanks to recursive inscriptions,"" Luminex added.  So far, BTC-69 seems to have delivered on its promise.  While the number of new inscriptions has surged, the daily fees paid for inscriptions remain stagnant, according to data tracked by Dune Analytics.  Ordinals went live in January, bringing the NFT and smart contracts narrative to the Bitcoin blockchain and spurring investor interest in tokens like STX, the native token of Bitcoin layer 2 Stacks Network.  Per Glassnode, the Ordinals boom can be divided into two waves, with the first representing activity between early February and late April.

Although Allaire views stablecoins as a superior option to CBDCs, he said the two are complimentary. “If central banks are going to upgrade their own systems to move away from legacy technology into more modern distributed ledger technology, that’s great,” he told SCMP. “There’s a whole bunch of things that are useful from that, but I view that as very different than the work that the private sector does to innovate on the public internet.”  Authorities in China would be hesitant to allow such a plan, as capital controls and a ban on the free convertibility of the yuan are pillars of its economic policy. In 2022, IMF First Deputy Managing Director Gita Gopinath said that China would need to open its capital markets and allow for full currency convertibility should it want to challenge the dollar.  Other stakeholders have noted that China would rather keep these rules in place rather than allow for free convertibility and an actual challenge to dollar dominance.  “I think there will be incremental moves to make greater use of the yuan to denominate China’s trade with commodity-exporting countries,” Brad Setser, a former senior advisor to the U.S. trade representative during the Biden administration, told Foreign Policy. “And then I think China will discover that it is difficult to fully go much further and to really radically change the structure of how it settles its trade.”  In many ways, Circle and Tether have been a net beneficiary of all of this. Research from Chainalysis shows that stablecoins are an effective tool for remittances, especially for Chinese companies that need to source from overseas.  Earlier this year, the team behind CNHC, a stablecoin tied to the offshore version of the yuan primarily used for the bond market, were arrested in Shanghai.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/07/11/china-should-consider-yuan-backed-stablecoins-instead-of-cbdcs-circles-allaire-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a79ec1ed30b56e52085a3a038e852736acca006f-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

14753594,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=542068,1689044444,"Tron Co-Founder Unstakes $56 Million From Ethereum Via Lido, Will ETH Prices Fall?","Justin Sun, the co-founder of Tron, withdrew 30,000 ETH, worth roughly $56 million, via two addresses via Lido, a liquidity staking service provider, on July 10, Lookonchain reveals. Following his move, his Ethereum stake via Lido is down to 263,294 ETH, or $491.6 million at spot rates. Justin Sun Unstakes From Ethereum Lookonchain, a blockchain analytics platform, notes that between February 25 and 27, Sun staked 288,100 ETH, or $538 million, and earned 5,194 ETH, or $9 million. This translates to average daily earnings of 38 ETH, or $72,000, going by the annualized percentage yield (APY) of around 4.87% offered by Lido on Ethereum stakers. Related Reading: Narrow Bitcoin Price Range Suggests Explosive Move Ahead The reasons behind Sun’s withdrawal of 30,000 ETH from Lido are unclear. It could indicate his intention to sell some of the ETH, transfer to a different staking platform, or even run his private Ethereum validator node. Despite this transfer, Sun remains one of the largest stakers at Lido, accounting for over 9% of the total ETH staked. While Sun’s decision to unstaked and transfer coins may be a cause of concern, ETH prices are firm when writing on July 10 and edging closer to $1,900. Contrary to fears ahead of the Shanghai upgrade in mid-April, the number of users staking ETH remains upward. Trackers show that over 21 million ETH has been locked by over 657,000 validators as of July 10. With the Shanghai upgrade implemented, ETH holders who had staked at least 32 ETH in the Beacon Chain from December 2020 can withdraw their assets. Despite earlier fears that more coins will be withdrawn and sold in the spot markets, impacting ETH prices, more validators and more coins have been locked on the Beacon Chain and other staking solutions. Will The SEC Dampen Coin Staking? Lido, the leading staking provider for ETH, is the largest decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol by total value locked (TVL), according to DeFiLlama. As of July 10, Lido managed over $14.6 billion of assets, most of which are ETH. Over $14.5 billion of ETH have been delegated and locked through Lido infrastructure. In Lido, users can stake ETH and other supported coins without needing lock-up periods or meeting high requirements, making it an attractive option for some investors. In lawsuits filed against crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase in early June, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) alleged that some proof-of-stake coins, including Cardano’s ADA and Algorand’s ALGO, were unregistered securities. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Tallies 10% Gains On Weekly Chart – Will It Cross $25? Following this assessment, their prices tanked, even impacting ETH. This is partly because Ethereum is now a proof-of-stake network after transiting from a proof-of-work algorithm and uses the same consensus system as those employed by competing smart contract platforms accused of issuing unregistered securities. The situation is worsened by Gary Gensler’s failure to clarify whether ETH is a utility like Bitcoin.

With the weather now clearing up in Texas, the world’s Bitcoin mining stronghold, miners are coming back online to double down on their operations. This time around, this has pushed the mining hash rate to a new all-time high. Hash Rate Reaches All-Time High Over the weekend, the mining hash rate reached a new all-time high. According to info from Hashrate Index backed by data from Ycharts, Bitcoin’s hash rate spiked to 465 EH/s on Saturday from 406 EH/s on the previous day. Related Reading: Analyst: Expect Altcoin Season After Bitcoin Halves In 2024 Specifically, the 7-day average hash rate hit 401 EH/s on Saturday, while the 3-day average has risen a more staggering 18% to 448 EH/s. Although the hash rate has now dropped to 425 EH/s at the time of writing, it is still at its highest levels and up more than 119.1% from one year ago. The increase in the hash rate has naturally led to an increase in the block production rate. Over the last couple of months, BTC miners had been targeting a block production rate of 6 per hour, now, a block is produced at an average time of 9 minutes and 15 seconds.

In the past 24 hours alone, the total volume of bitcoin traded increased by 30.37%. According to a report by published by Coin Metrics on July 5, BTC miners generated a remarkable revenue of $2.4 billion during the second quarter of 2023. Out of this amount, $184 million came from transaction fees alone, representing more than the five preceding quarters combined. This increase in transaction fee revenue is traced to the increase in transaction volume after BRC-20 tokens were introduced on the Bitcoin blockchain. The BRC-20 came in as a token standard to allow the creation and transfer facilities of fungible tokens on the blockchain through the use of ordinal inscriptions.

Investors will be looking for declines that could justify the U.S. central bank reversing course on its intent to raise interest rates 25 basis points (bps). A return to monetary hawkishness would follow the Federal Reserve pausing rate hikes last month for the first time in more than a year. The Fed’s prescription has helped cut the CPI from 9% in August 2022 to May’s 4% reading, although it has more recently also raised concerns about an overstep that could cast the economy into a steep recession.  CPI  On Wednesday, observers of U.S. monetary policy will eye the Labor Department’s release of the June CPI. The CPI has edged steadily downward since last year’s high. Economists’ consensus see June’s index dipping in the mid 3% range, although Edward Moya, senior market analyst at foreign exchange market maker Oanda, wrote in a Monday note that it could tumble to 2.8%. Yet Moya also noted that core inflation, which excludes more volatile food and energy costs, could remain hot, a result of an expensive housing market. “Pricing pressures might remain throughout the summer,” Moya wrote.  PPI  The PPI, which measures price changes at the wholesale level, often foreshadows changes that consumers face in the future. The May PPI sank to 1.1% annually, beating expectations for a 1.5% decline and down sharply from the previous month’s 2.3% reading. The consensus is for a 0.4% reading in June.  Jobless Claims  Also on Thursday, the U.S. Labor Department announces jobless claims for the week ending July 8. Recent jobs data has offered slightly different perspectives on the state of the state of the jobs market. Last week’s ADP report showed businesses adding almost a half-million private sector jobs, more than double economists’ expectations. The unexpectedly strong results offered support for the Fed to reapply its aggressive inflation treatments. A strong employment market suggests that the economy is expanding, which often precedes higher prices.

The number of wallets holding at least one bitcoin has reached an all-time high of 1,008,737 million, according to data from Glassnode.  This increased distribution of wallets with at least one bitcoin suggests increased decentralization of the network. Meanwhile, Glassnode’s data shows that the number of whales is also decreasing.  The number of wallets holding at least one bitcoin first crossed the million mark in May and has been rising since.  All this comes as the popularity of ordinals increases the load on the Bitcoin network.  A number of metrics are showing increased activity, from an uptick in miners transferring coins to exchanges to the number of addresses with a balance greater than 0.1.  Bitcoin’s next big moves will likely come later this week as jobless claims and CPI data are released, both of which will indicate how successful the Fed’s moves at taming inflation are – data that traders zoom in on when making their next moves.

But as of last month, it’s having trouble fulfilling that role as its fiat pipelines are suspended.  With no fiat liquidity, this has put the exchange in a weird place. Bitcoin is trading at a discount of 9%, as is Tether (USDT); the world’s biggest dollar-pegged stablecoin is trading at a nearly 9-cent discount from other exchanges.  The exchange’s market depth or traders’ ability to execute large orders at stable prices has also deteriorated significantly in recent months, aiding wild price action.  Data from research group Kaiko shows that market depth has collapsed on Binance.US, with an over 60% drop in liquidity available on the platform in June.  Adrian Wang, founder, and CEO at digital assets wealth management firm Metalpha, points to the looming withdrawal deadline of July 20 as a reason for the depegging.  “As the days approach this deadline, lesser liquidity and lesser banks to exchange fiat means that we may see this de-peg continue,” he told CoinDesk.  An easy trade right now is to buy USDT at a discount on Binance.US and move it elsewhere to trade with. But it just can’t involve fiat ramps – the bread and butter of most of Binance.US’ users.  “I think there might be some arbitrage opportunities for institutions or market makers, but retail traders wouldn’t likely have the risk tolerance or understanding,” Nick Ruck, COO of DeFi protocol ContentFi Labs said to CoinDesk in a note.  Certainly, many have been doing this to enjoy free money; in the last week the exchange has had a netflow of negative $16.2 million, according to Nansen.ai data.  Although some have said such a trade is not worth the risk.  But the question is, why hasn’t this resolved itself? Why hasn’t it either brought down Tether’s overall value, or pushed back up the value of USDT on Binance.US?  “Compared with the total circulation of USDT, the selling volume is not enough to affect the overall market price in the end,” Tony Ling, co-founder of data portal NFTGo, and a partner at Bizantine Capital, told CoinDesk. “There have been more serious price deviations before, and nothing happened in the end.”  For now, enjoy the free money.

14750246,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=542051,1689037252,"Bitcoin Google Search Interest Stands At Critical Level, What This Forecast For BTC","The price of Bitcoin is stuck at its current levels as bulls and bears fight for control. The number one cryptocurrency by market cap experienced some gains in the past weeks, but volatility across the board declined, leading to the current dynamic. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sharks And Whales Go On $2.15 Billion Buying Spree, Is It Time To Sell? As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $30,500 with sideways movement in the last 24 hours. Over the past week, the cryptocurrency has recorded a 2% loss while the rest of the sector follows and records steeper losses. Google Metric Hints At Profits For Bitcoin? According to analyst Dylan LeClair, Google searches for Bitcoin Price have declined since 2023. The chart below shows that searches for this keyword decreased since 2021. At that time, BTC was on a bull run and managed to climb as high as $69,000 from a $3,000 low last seen in March 2020. In that sense, Google searches for Bitcoin Price operate as a proxy to gauge interest in the cryptocurrency. Interest from mainstream media and non-crypto investors follows the price of the cryptocurrency. The higher the interest the chart hints at, the higher the price. Conversely, interest declines as the price of the cryptocurrency declines. Historical interest in the keyword “Bitcoin price” on Google has fluctuated to the upside, as the chart below shows. In the 2017 to 2018 bull run, the monthly searches for this keyword rose to unprecedented levels, but the percentile has been consistent on the downside since 2019 before BTC can resume its bullish momentum. In other words, since 2017, BTC only enters a bull-run phase when interest declines to a certain point; the metric is close to those levels. LeClair stated the following while pointing out: Bitcoin price vs. Google Search Interest. The bottom pane shows the ratio of the two ( $BTC price / search interest percentile). Notice how price relative to media hype & search interest is up and to the right? Think about it… On when BTC could break its current price action, analyst and NewsBTC Editorial Director Tony Spilotro pointed at the Bollinger Bands. An indicator that gauges potential spikes in volatility and price action. Related Reading: Analyst: Expect Altcoin Season After Bitcoin Halves In 2024 Spilotro stated while sharing the chart below: Bitcoin Bollinger Bands are the tightest on the daily since the start of 2023.

14748509,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=542054,1689033613,"Bitcoin Inscriptions Cool Off, Transactions Heat Up: What’s Next For The Market?","Bitcoin (BTC) has been consolidating below the mid-point of the 2021-22 cycle at $30,000, with some on-chain activity metrics cooling off while others, such as money transfer volumes, are picking up. This suggests positive momentum and growing adoption for the asset, according to a recent report from Glassnode. Bitcoin Metrics Suggest A Wild Ride Ahead The report highlights that BTC’s recovery in 2023 has been remarkably robust in terms of price performance and network utilization, indicating strong underlying demand for the asset. Active address momentum is climbing again, indicating a healthy network and growing adoption of Bitcoin. The balance of supply held in profit vs. loss has reached an equilibrium point, synonymous with the several months-long ‘re-accumulation period’ in past cycles. Related Reading: Analyst: Expect Altcoin Season After Bitcoin Halves In 2024 Moreover, the report suggests that BTC volumes being transferred are starting to pick up meaningfully. BTC changing hands, lifting 75% off the FTX lows, now reaching $4.2 billion per day in total settlement. This is a positive sign for the Bitcoin network, indicating a return toward the dominance of BTC monetary transfers. The report also provides a chart demonstrating a significant supply cluster between $15,000 and $30,000, indicating that many coins changed hands over the last 12 months. Conversely, just 25% of the supply was acquired at prices above $30,000, held by buyers from the 2021-22 cycle. Furthermore, the Long and Short-Term heuristic shows that a sizeable volume of long-term holders (LTH) supply was acquired between $15,000 and $25,000 and remains unspent, despite prices reaching $31,000. Additionally, almost all coins with an acquisition price above $30,000 are held by LTHs, who are likely to create resistance should the market rally higher. Moreover, the report further highlights that the price range between $20,000 and $30,000 has seen expanding accumulation since February, despite regulatory pressure in the US. This supply distribution is quite ‘bottom-heavy,’ suggesting a relatively firm foundation of investor holdings exists below $30,000. BTC’s Independence From Altcoins On The Rise Bitcoin’s correlation with altcoins has declined in the first half of 2023, according to a report by Kaiko, a cryptocurrency market data provider. The report shows that altcoins have been hit hard by rising regulatory uncertainty in the US, with several exchanges delisting major altcoins over the past few weeks. In contrast, Bitcoin has shown resilience, attracting institutional inflows and benefiting from regulatory clarity around its status as a commodity. Related Reading: Arkham’s New Crypto Intel Trading Platform: A Game Changer For Traders? The report highlights that Bitcoin’s correlation with other major cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash, has declined significantly since last year. The decline in correlation is a sign that Bitcoin is becoming less influenced by the movements of other cryptocurrencies, indicating that it is starting to establish itself as a more independent asset. XRP saw the strongest decrease in correlation, which is linked to the token’s rising volatility as the outcome of the SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit edges closer. The report indicates that XRP’s volatility has increased significantly in recent months, leading to a sharp decline in its correlation with other cryptocurrencies. The report suggests that Bitcoin’s resilience in the face of regulatory uncertainty is largely due to its status as a commodity, which has been confirmed by regulatory bodies such as the Commodity and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). On BTC’s one-day chart, the largest cryptocurrency in the market is currently trading at $30,500, reflecting a 0.9% increase over the past 24 hours.
