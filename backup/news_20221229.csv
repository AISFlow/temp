42388284,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRDM37,1672357696,FBI Investigating 3Commas Data Breach,"The FBI is investigating the 3Commas data breach, CoinDesk has learned. The investigation comes after weeks of criticism from users of the Estonia-based crypto trading service, who say its CEO repeatedly brushed off warning signs that the platform had leaked user data.  This week, 100,000 Binance and KuCoin API keys linked to 3Commas were leaked by an anonymous person. On Thursday, two 3Commas users told CoinDesk that they were contacted by agents from the FBI’s Cincinnati Field Office in connection to the leak.  Over the last several months, dozens of 3Commas users found that the service had, without their consent, traded away funds on crypto exchanges they’d linked to it. Initially, 3Commas said that these users were most likely phished and insisted that the platform was safe.  The API database leaker insinuated that the 3Commas keys had been sold by someone from within the company, but 3Commas CEO Yuriy Sorokin said in a statement on Thursday that “3Commas stresses that it has found no evidence during the internal investigation that any employee of 3Commas was somehow involved in attacks against the API data.”  “Since becoming aware of the suspicious activities taking place, we immediately launched an internal investigation. We will continue with the investigation in the light of the new information and also notify law enforcement authorities accordingly,” Sorokin said in the statement.  A 3Commas victim group, which has around 60 members, previously reached out to the U.S. Secret Service and other law enforcement agencies in an attempt to understand how their funds had gone missing. The group’s leader, Edmundo (Mundy) Pena, told CoinDesk that he has tallied the group’s losses at over $20 million.  The FBI and 3Commas did not immediately respond to CoinDesk’s requests for comment.",NEGATIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING | BNB,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/12/29/fbi-investigating-3commas-data-breach,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7254e833f5861c6b1e82813de186193e326aebc4-2121x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

6665544,https://newsbtc.com/?p=514147,1672354816,"Dogecoin Beats Bitcoin, Ethereum For Best Performance In Crypto Top 10","Dogecoin has once again emerged as one of the best performers for the year when it comes to the top 10 cryptocurrencies. The meme coin which enjoyed massive popularity in 2021 continues to hold on to gains even better than larger counterparts such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Dogecoin Performs Exceptionally Well In a year where there were numerous implosions that tanked the crypto market further, dogecoin has come forward as a force to be reckoned with. It has held on to its value ahead of some of the largest cryptocurrencies in the space. Related Reading: Prolonged Crypto Winter Pushes Kraken Exchange Out Of Japan Naturally, most cryptocurrencies have lost a significant chunk of their value but where dogecoin has lost only about 58% of its value in 2022, others such as bitcoin and ethereum have recorded yearly losses of 65% and 67%, respectively. This already puts the meme coin ahead of the two largest cryptocurrencies in the market. It also outperformed the likes of Cardano and Polygon, both of which are the ninth and tenth largest cryptocurrencies in the market. Cardano’s value is down more than 80% while Polygon has recorded declines of approximately 69% this year. DOGE holding above $0.07 | Source: DOGEUSD on TradingView.com The meme coin was only surpassed by Binance Coin (BNB) and XRP. Where BNB is down 53%, XRP is down 57%. This makes BNB the best performer out of the top 10, XRP is the second-best performer, and dogecoin is a close third. Other Metrics For Top 10 Cryptos Dogecoin has also done a good job in its rise from its cycle low. After touching $0.05 in June, it has managed to rise over 42% since then to be sitting at $0.07 at the time of this writing. However, it is still not the most accomplished in this regard. That title goes to XRP. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could See Another Bull Rally If This Happens XRP’s cycle low of $0.11 and its current price of $0.35 means that the digital asset is up almost 207% in the last 10 months. Another asset that saw triple-digit recoveries from the cycle low is Polygon which is up 142% from its June cycle low of $0.32. Others in the top 10 have not performed as well. Bitcoin is down around 6% from its cycle low of $17,664, and Cardano is seeing 38% losses from its cycle low of $0.4. Meanwhile, Ethereum and BNB are seeing much better headwinds with 33.65% and 32.41% increases, respectively. Nevertheless, this makes dogecoin the third-best performer once more using this metric. An impressive run for a meme coin mainly driven by hype.

6665543,https://newsbtc.com/?p=514157,1672354812,"Bitcoin Now Under Realized Price For 163 Days, Here’s How This Compares Historically","On-chain data shows Bitcoin has now been below its realized price for 163 days in this bear market; here’s how this compares with previous cycles. Bitcoin Realized Price Is Currently Valued At Around $19,900 According to CryptoQuant’s year-end dashboard release, the bear market would be over if BTC reclaims this level. To understand what the “realized price” is, the “realized cap” must be looked at first. The realized cap is a capitalization model for Bitcoin that aims to provide a sort of “real value” for the crypto. Unlike the usual market cap, which simply values each coin in circulation using the current BTC price, the realized cap prices each token at the same price it was last moved. For example, if 1 BTC was bought at $20,000, but the price has now changed to $16,000, the market cap will consider it valued at $16,000. The realized cap, however, will say its true value is $20,000. Now, if the total realized cap of Bitcoin is divided by the total number of coins in circulation, a “realized price” is obtained. This price signifies the cost-basis of the average coin in the market (that is, the price at which investors acquired the average coin at). Here is a chart that shows the trend in the BTC realized price over the entire history of the asset: The BTC price seems to have been below this metric in recent months | Source: CryptoQuant As the above graph displays, the normal price of Bitcoin has been below the realized price for a while now. Historically, BTC has spent very little time in this region, as only the worst phases of a bear market usually pull the coin below the level. From the chart, it’s apparent that In the 2011-2012 bear market, BTC spent 158 days under the realized price. Then, in 2014-2015, the coin spent a whopping 276 days in this zone. Related Reading: Bitcoin Interexchange Flow Pulse About To Reverse, What Does It Mean? The 2018-2019 bear saw the shortest amount of time in the region, as the price took 134 days to pull itself above the level. Finally, Bitcoin has been trapped under the realized price for 163 days in the current cycle. This means that BTC has spent more time in this region in the current bear market than in any other before, except for 2014-2015. If the current bear is comparable to 2014-2015, then it would mean there is still more than 100 days to go before Bitcoin can exit the zone. Related Reading: Litecoin Bullish Signal: Shark And Whale Addresses Hit 2-Year High Either way, CryptoQuant expects the crypto to reclaim this level somewhere in 2023, and it will be then that this bear may be considered to be over.

42411679,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfEvp,1672340767,How to Level Up Your Knowledge of Web3 Gaming,"Video games, which were once branded the catalyst for societal ruin by concerned parents everywhere, are now being embraced as a tool for mass adoption in the crypto sector.  Investors are betting big on Web3 gaming, or games underpinned by blockchain technology, even amid an extended crypto winter that has chilled many other markets. According to a report from blockchain data firm DappRadar, $748 million was raised in August 2022 for the development of new Web3 games.  But despite excitement among industry insiders and crypto gamers, a study from game publisher Coda Labs found that only 12% of gamers surveyed had tried playing a Web3 game and only 3% owned a non-fungible token (NFT).  “I still see Web3 gaming as being very early,” said Roshni Cox, chief operating officer at Hellebore, a blockchain-based game studio. “Anyone that's involved now is helping to shape it.”  It’s clear that there is an institutional interest in building out the Web3 gaming sector, though brands will need to come up with solutions to better bring existing gamers into the fold. Today’s gamers, artists, creatives and influencers should start learning about blockchain-based gaming to stay ahead of the curve, and even taking small steps, like setting up a crypto wallet, can help interested parties become more familiar with the budding technology.  Ahead are some takes from industry experts such as Yat Siu, co-founder and executive chairman of leading blockchain game publisher Animoca Brands, about the future of Web3 gaming and how to break into the budding industry.  What is Web3 gaming?  Web3 gaming is an umbrella term to describe games that use cryptocurrency, NFTs or blockchain technology to augment the user experience. The goal of these blockchain-based projects is to empower players and offer them more control over their digital identities and assets.  In theory, Web3 games can have the same appeal as other types of video games like massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs), puzzle games and strategy games. But blockchain technology helps to propel those games forward by offering cryptographically secured payment rails and verifiable ownership over digital in-game assets through NFTs.  “Web3 doesn’t really change the quality of the game,” Siu said. “It shouldn’t change how the game should look or why the game is exciting. All it does is open up the ability to have new financial systems in the game.”  Types of Web3 games  Web3 gaming is still nascent, but over the past few years, several popular categories of have emerged, each using blockchain technology in unique ways:  Play-to-earn: Also known as GameFi, Play-to-earn rewards users with cryptocurrency or NFTs for gameplay. Many games require an initial purchase of one of the game’s assets to start earning, and these assets can typically be acquired within the game or on secondary NFT marketplaces. Popular play-to-earn games include Axie Infinity, which allows players to purchase in-game virtual pets as NFTs that can battle and breed to earn in-game tokens, and Zed Run, an online horse racing game where players can buy, sell or breed horses and bet on races.  Move-to-earn: An offshoot of play-to-earn, move-to-earn games reward users for moving around in the real world. STEPN is a popular game where players need to buy or rent a pair of NFT sneakers to start earning rewards by performing physical activities.  Metaverse worlds: Metaverse worlds are immersive virtual spaces often constructed from user-generated content. Many metaverse worlds contain game-like gatherings or elements of gamification to incentivize collaboration and socialization. The Sandbox is a popular open-world platform where players can buy land and build games.  Fantasy sports: Riffing off of traditional fantasy sports leagues, platforms like Sorare allow users to collect digital player cards, build lineups and earn points based on players’ real-life performances. Hellebore, as another example, allows users to buy NFTs and predict the outcomes of games across professional sporting leagues.  There have also been examples of games that found creative ways to incorporate blockchain technology into their experience. In September 2021, a blockchain project called Loot launched a collection of 8,000 text-based NFTs meant to be used as items in games created by the community.  Several existing Web2 games have also recently embraced NFTs, including Ubisoft’s Ghost Recon: Breakpoint and Square Enix's Final Fantasy.  NFTs as new revenue streams for gamers  Blockchain games often offer in-game assets as NFTs that players can earn or purchase.  NFTs are cryptographic tokens that allow players to verify ownership of a particular item. For gamers, that could mean in-game skins, rare collectibles or access passes to exclusive content or future releases – concepts gamers are already familiar with. With Web3, they are made more secure on a blockchain.  “The easiest way to explain to a gamer the value that they're getting with any sort of blockchain technology is that these are digital collectibles,” Hellebore's Cox said. “Digital collectibles are never going to go away, it's just now in a digitized form for a digitally native person.”  NFTs can also be traded and sold in-game and on secondary marketplaces, opening up new revenue streams for players.  “Gamers themselves are very entrepreneurial people,” said John Linden, CEO of game technology company Mythical Games. “I think what we're going to see is players that become entrepreneurial inside the games.”  Jonathan Brun, CEO and co-founder of metaverse search engine Lighthouse, calls this aspect of Web3 gaming “a paradigm shift.” Roughly $54 billion is spent annually on virtual goods, skins and lives, according to JP Morgan’s 2022 Opportunities in the Metaverse report. Using blockchain technology, these types of assets can be traded and resold on secondary marketplaces, creating new opportunities for interaction and monetization.  “Once you know you can resell [digital assets], it makes sense to expect this activity is going to increase,” Brun said.  Web3 also demands that industry leaders revisit existing fee structures that favor traditional tech companies, Siu explained.  “The gaming industry last year generated over $20 billion in revenue, which is bigger than music and film combined,” he said. “On top of that, 30% [in fees] typically goes to platforms – whether Apple or Google or Steam. We're talking about a sum total of over $100 billion of extracted value from the gaming industry – how much of that $100 billion actually goes back [to the gamers]?”  Data ownership and identity management  Web3 gaming proposes a future in which players can have more control of their online identity and data. Crypto wallets could one day act as an alternative to existing single sign-on methods, allowing users to consolidate their logins and prevent their data from being shared with third parties.  While the technology (and its adoption) are still early, decentralized identity products like Disco are cropping up. Ideally, Web3 will allow players to travel through various gaming worlds and experiences and maintain ownership over a singular digital identity that is both secure and user owned.  Several companies, including Ubisoft, Yuga Labs and Animoca Brands, are exploring ways to bring these interoperable digital identities into the metaverse.  “Our long-term efforts led us to understand how blockchain’s decentralized approach could genuinely make players stakeholders of our games, in a way that is also sustainable for our industry, placing back into their hands the value they generate through the time they spend, the items they buy or the content they create online,” said Nicolas Pouard, vice president of Ubisoft’s Strategic Innovation Lab, when the French video-game publisher launched its NFT platform Quartz in December 2021.  Your Web3 gaming toolkit  If you are a developer or gamer and are interested in Web3 gaming, there are several steps you can take to make yourself more familiar with the sector:  Set up a crypto wallet  The first thing to do when exploring Web3 gaming is to set up a blockchain wallet, according to Brun.  Some Web3 gaming companies are simplifying this step by setting users up with what’s known as a custodial crypto wallet that is managed and secured by the platform. Users access their wallets like they would a traditional gaming account (likely a username and password), but their digital assets are stored in a wallet hosted by the platform.  In some cases, platforms that use this approach aim to help players switch to a self-custody wallet once they are ready to take full ownership of their digital assets.  For instance, Mythical Games’ Mythical Platform, a full-service blockchain integration system, is built on the company’s unique blockchain that is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This allows players who are new to the sector to use the platform’s custodial wallet, while more advanced players have the option to link their own wallets via bridges between the Mythical Chain and the Ethereum blockchain.  “We will eventually go non-custodial or we will let players opt in to become non-custodial,” Linden said, noting that the Mythical Games sees this level of adoption as a phased rollout requiring more consumer education. Less than 5% of players were interested in self-custody as of December 2022, he estimated: “There’s a small percentage. It's growing, but very slowly. But when you go non-custodial, you have more issues around scams and things like that.”  Learn about user-generated content tools  Popular among many burgeoning Web3 gaming worlds are contests, incentives and collaborations that encourage players to contribute or design gaming experiences. This type of content is called user-generated content.  Félix Bossé, Lighthouse’s metaverse researcher, takes pride in experimenting with user-generated content throughout popular metaverse worlds like Voxels and Mona. He designed a 3D pumpkin patch on the Ethereum-based platform Hyperfy using Blender, an open-source 3D animation tool. With community input, Bossé even penned a storyline describing a witch who stole the pumpkins and then challenged his peers to ""save Halloween"" by playing.  “It was a really fun way for me to experiment with community-built worlds and decentralized world-building,” Bossé said.  Brush up on financial literacy  Web3 gaming requires that players enhance their understanding of cryptocurrency and blockchain payment tools. This can make some gamers “fearful,” said Siu.  “[Some gamers] don't understand financial systems,” he said. “A bank account allows you to deposit money, but that doesn't actually mean you're investing. Nor does it mean that you know anything about earning yield. I think this comes down to financial education.”  If you are looking for a place to start, here are pieces on why people invest in cryptocurrency, how to pick the right play-to-earn game and how to invest in the metaverse.  Some digital assets can be highly speculative, and so it’s important to manage your funds wisely and exercise caution when making high-risk bets.  Of course, Web3 gaming isn't necessarily about getting rich quickly. Rather, it’s about redefining the gaming industry and giving players an opportunity to own their identities and assets within gaming worlds and across platforms.",NEUTRAL,없음,AXS | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | TECHNOLOGY,Megan DeMatteo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/how-to-level-up-your-knowledge-of-web3-gaming,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/772d2869210b2d4b622fae4c6a4592d55be66c10-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

At the moment, however, the meme coin was consolidating on its daily chart. In the past week, the Dogecoin price has slipped almost 4%. As Bitcoin depicted positive price action in the last 24 hours, many other altcoins also moved up on their respective charts. The technical outlook of the meme-coin pointed towards circumstances changing for sellers. Buyers made an entrance, DOGE is, however still under the control of the bears. If demand continues to accelerate, the price of the coin is expected to move upward. The coin must remain above its current support line for that to happen. Currently, DOGE is trading at a level that has acted as support and has also been retested twice recently. Traders can expect to find long trade positions if the coin remains above two critical price levels. DOGE now trades at a 90% discount to its all-time high, which it secured last year. Related Reading: Solana Suffers Double-Digit Losses, Is There An End In Sight? Dogecoin Price Analysis: One-Day Chart DOGE was trading at $0.071 at the time of writing. The coin has just moved up the $0.069 support line in the past two days, which is now a crucial price floor. The Dogecoin price has to remain above $0.069 and the $0.070 mark for the coin to propel higher. The coin might experience a pullback at the $0.072 level, which is why Dogecoin must sustain itself above the $0.069 level. If the coin trades above the $0.072 mark, then the Dogecoin price can rally and reach the $0.077 price ceiling. The amount of Dogecoin traded in the last session was green, which indicated a rise in buying strength. Technical Analysis The meme-coin recovered from the oversold region as accumulation showed up on the daily chart. The Relative Strength Index noted an uptick, which signified that the coin registered an increase in buyers. The indicator was, however, still in the seller’s territory. On the same note, the Dogecoin price traveled below the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line, which meant that sellers were driving the price momentum in the market. The indicator also depicted that there was a chance for DOGE to rally as a slight push from buyers will make the price rise above the 200-Simple Moving Average line (green), which is an extremely bullish signal for the coin. Traders could attempt to short at this level as a technical indicator depicts a sell signal. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence signal bar indicates price momentum and trend reversal. This red signal bar is linked to the sell signal, which could imply that the value of the meme-coin will fall slightly before attempting to break through the immediate resistance mark. The Bollinger Bands portray price fluctuation and volatility; the bands had widened, indicating chances of a price increase. The upper band was at $0.078, which also meant that there was strong resistance at that price level.

42388301,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRDNBH,1672339958,"Step Aside, Ethereum: Blockchain Project Stacks Wants to Bring Smart Contracts to Bitcoin","Blockchain project Stacks has published a whitepaper showing how a new digital asset called “Stacks bitcoin” (sBTC) can be used to make Bitcoin fully programmable.  Unlike Ethereum or Solana where developers can conjure up all manner of algorithmic machinations – think six-figure gorilla avatars – Bitcoin’s simpler scripting language limits what Bitcoin developers can create on the platform.  Stacks, an existing smart contract platform, wants to break through those limitations by introducing a new digital asset derived from bitcoin – sBTC (pegged at 1:1 with bitcoin) – that can be used to create smart contracts on Stacks, but can also be readily converted back to bitcoin (BTC).  “Bitcoin is, by design, relatively slow and does not natively provide the fully-expressive smart  contracts needed to build sophisticated applications,” the whitepaper states. “Faster and more sophisticated applications must therefore be built outside of the base layer. Bitcoin layers enable this.”  Read more: Smart Contract Platforms: Past, Present and Future  The term “layers” is Stacks’ lingo for any system outside of Bitcoin’s base layer, such as a sidechain, which is a secondary blockchain that interacts with a primary blockchain. In the whitepaper, Stacks acts as a Bitcoin sidechain, powered by both sBTC and STX – Stacks’ native token.  The project claims in its white paper that its Bitcoin sidechain can unlock “hundreds of billions of dollars” in DeFi on Bitcoin.  The concept is still in the implementation phase and will be formalized under Stacks Improvement Proposal (SIP) 21, according to Stacks co-founder, Muneeb Ali.  “The vote went through and implementation has started,” Ali confirmed during an interview with CoinDesk.”This is going to be the next major release. My best guess is maybe eight to nine months from now.”     How sBTC works  The current Stacks protocol uses a consensus mechanism (how computers agree on the state of a network) called “proof of transfer,” where anyone can be a miner or “stacker.”  Miners earn STX rewards for mining Stacks blocks, but must first post bitcoin to earn mining privileges. That bitcoin is subsequently distributed as a reward to stackers who maintain a copy of the Stacks ledger; stackers must also lock up STX for a certain length of time to receive stacking privileges.  In the proposed sBTC peg system, users send regular bitcoin to a wallet controlled by stackers (a process referred to as “pegging in”). This action mints an equivalent number of sBTC that can be used in smart contracts on Stacks.  To get their bitcoin back (“pegging out”), users return sBTC to the wallet. Stackers then sign these peg out requests and release the equivalent amount of bitcoin back to the users. This also prompts the Stacks protocol to burn the corresponding sBTC.  “It's a fully trustless system. It's a protocol,” says Ali. “There is a dynamic set of signers who have economic incentives to be signers and they sign the peg transactions.”     Sidechain smörgåsbord  Bitcoin sidechains aren’t new. Blockstream, a Bitcoin infrastructure firm, published a whitepaper on sidechains as early as 2014, and currently has a fully functional sidechain federation called Liquid.  Earlier this month, Layer 2 Labs raised a $3 million seed round from angel investors to develop “drivechains,” another flavor of Bitcoin sidechains.  Read more: Bitcoin Development Company Layer 2 Labs Raises $3M to Bring Drivechains to Network  In addition, Bitcoin developer Ruben Somsen has been working on “spacechains,” which he describes as “one-way pegged sidechains for Bitcoin.”  So what new innovation does sBTC bring to the sidechains conversation? Ali claims the sBTC model is unique in that anyone can be a miner or stacker. He sees the use of STX to incentivize stackers to sign peg out requests as a distinct advantage, although alternative projects tend to avoid the use of altcoins such as STX like the plague.  “It's a trade off,” Ali explains. “The trade off you're making with Liquid is that users need to trust Blockstream and friends – the federation. On Stacks, because there is the extra [STX] token, there is no company in the middle. So you can pick one; you can't have both.”",POSITIVE,BTC | STX,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MINING | STX,Frederick Munawa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/12/29/step-aside-ethereum-blockchain-project-stacks-wants-to-bring-smart-contracts-to-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/38967e90166c5642bec5e0eb8b80b136210d46e9-6000x3345.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to data from Web3 developer backend Alchemy published in October, NFT trading volume fell 88% since the third quarter of last year. Disasters for the crypto industry – like the collapse of crypto payments ecosystem Terra,crypto lender Celsius, crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital and most recently Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX empire – have made an already bad situation worse.  Still, all hope is not lost for passionate NFT hodlers, who may have dwindled in numbers but have grown in loyalty. Data from Alchemy shows that the number of smart contracts deployed on Ethereum grew by over 40% since the end of the first quarter, highlighting long-term conviction in the digital asset space and continued development of Web3 projects despite frosty conditions.

From utility to community building, here are just a few trends that will continue to define the space in 2023.  Commitment to community  The Word of the Year, according to the publisher behind the Oxford English Dictionary, was “goblin mode.”  The popular dictionary defines this word as “a type of behavior which is unapologetically self-indulgent, lazy, slovenly, or greedy, typically in a way that rejects social norms or expectations.”  Nothing exemplified going “goblin mode” in 2022 more than the surprise success of the NFT collection Goblintown.  The profile-picture (PFP) collection features an eccentric line-up of memefied goblin characters, and the name of the collection is a colloquial nod to the somewhat disheveled state of the crypto market. The entire collection was free to mint and seemed to have emerged out of the blue.  By May 2022, when the project was released, ETH had lost a significant percentage of its 2021 value, dropping to about $2,000. Despite this, the project made 3,800 ETH (about $7 million) after launch, and in June, its floor price soared to a high of 7.3 ETH, (about $13,000 at the time).  Alex Taub, the co-founder of Truth Labs, the Web3 creator collective behind Goblintown, told CoinDesk that a large contributor to the collection’s success was the sense of community it fostered with its artwork and narrative.  “The concept was that everyone was ‘going down to Goblintown’ because they were losing money.” He called the artwork “ugly but well done,” which resonated with a community of collectors. “You can do anything right if you have great compelling characters and story,” Taub said.  He predicted that NFT collections that stand a chance at success in 2023 will be those that “cultivate community” by focusing on smaller collections and narrative storytelling.  “You'll still have winners here and there,” Taub said, referencing one-off collections that soared during the hype period of 2022. “But for the most part, it's high-quality effort [to build community] that will be rewarded.”  A focus on long-term utility  Other projects found success this year by embedding NFTs with utility, which means real-world use cases and value beyond just being digital collectibles. Utility for NFT holders can come in the form of land deeds and home ownership titles, or be linked to exclusive experiences like concerts, restaurant bookings, parties and more.  Matt Medved, CEO of digital asset publication NFTNow, told CoinDesk that in this past year we’ve started to see new use cases for non-fungible tokens that will likely continue to in 2023.  “Utility-based projects can take a lot of different forms, but they are going to really tap into human behavior, human psychology, human desires and different communities,” Medved said. “They are going to be innovating at the forefront of what [blockchain] technology can really offer.”  NFT collective PROOF released its NFT collection of pixelated owls called Moonbirds in April, which clocked in $200 million in primary and secondary sales within two days of launching. “Each Moonbird unlocks private club membership and additional benefits the longer you hold them,” the project explains on its website, coining the term “nesting” for holders that lock up their assets long-term.  Justin Mezzell, co-founder and chief product officer of PROOF explained that building a passionate collector community and incentivizing long-term holding has contributed to the project’s success and is part of its plan for 2023.  “We want community tooling to exist as a product,” Mezzell said. “We are interested in building a socialized platform to figure out not only how Moonbirds meet one another, how to discuss the things that they're excited about, but ultimately, how do we bring in other people into the conversation as well.”  Building authentic Web3 strategies  Web3 was certainly the buzzword of 2022, and it felt, for a time, that every brand was eager to integrate NFTs or the metaverse into their business strategy.  Maja Vujinovic, managing director of Web3 investment firm OGroupLLC and NFT investor, told CoinDesk that rather than looking at pre-existing goods or services and simply putting them on-chain as a performative gesture, it’s important to analyze what putting these assets on-chain means for consumers and the project’s long-term growth.  See also: Are NFTs Rendering Art Meaningless? | Opinion  She noted that while the Starbucks Odyssey NFT rewards program, which recently launched a closed beta test, is a big move for the national coffee chain that may help spark mass adoption, she questioned the intrinsic value of putting the loyalty stamp on-chain, rather than sticking with its existing rewards strategy.  Vujinovic said that future Web3 activations must incorporate “creativity on a human level,” rather than acting as a corporate marketing strategy.  NFT projects as creative ecosystems  As the state of the crypto market remains uncertain in the year to come, projects need to work smarter – not harder – to succeed.  Many successful projects have used intellectual property (IP) licensing agreements to create new revenue streams for holders and accelerate the growth of their brands.  Yuga Labs, the NFT startup behind Bored Ape Yacht Club, has released the IP rights of all of its projects, including CryptoPunks and Meebits, to holders, allowing their NFT characters to be used on branding for food trucks, TV shows, music groups and more.  Other projects, like Moonbirds and Goblintown, have embraced the CC0 license, which essentially puts the use of their characters into the public domain, even for commercial purposes.  See also: Empire of the Bored Apes | Most Influential 2022  NFT creators are also looking beyond art and are building entire worlds around their characters. In 2023, Yuga Labs is shifting its focus toward building The Otherside, a gamified, narrative-driven metaverse initiative that allows users to turn their NFTs into playable characters.  “We're leading the way for a new generation of builders and it's really exciting,” a Yuga Labs spokesperson told CoinDesk. “Otherside is a massively ambitious project that requires a ton of innovation and all eyes are on us to get that right.”  Given the pace at which the NFT market moves, it’s certain that new trends will emerge in 2023. Use cases for NFTs will continue to expand and builders will create new tools for experimentation and creative collaboration. While 2021 was all about hype, 2022 was about introspection and revisiting why builders turned to Web3 in the first place. And as we approach a new year, one thing is clear: the relatively nascent NFT space still has room to grow.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2022/12/29/its-been-a-year-since-nfts-exploded-where-are-we-headed,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e6f89c50c8cc7a2a380be7d6a1a1ad7adcff7961-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The asset has already lost a massive chunk of its all-time high value but the onslaught looks to be far from over. In the last seven days, the losses for the digital asset have ramped up, dragging its price down into single-digit territory. Solana Posts More Than 20% Losses According to crypto data aggregator Coinmarketcap, the price of Solana is down more than 20% in the last 7 days alone. These losses align with the general bear market trend being experienced in the crypto sector but the decline in faith in the digital asset brought about by the collapse of FTX, Solana’s biggest support, puts added pressure on it.

However, with all of that money gone, the network has had a hard time keeping up. Also, as James Spediacci notes on Twitter, a lot of the dev activity on the network was actually faked. It alleges that SOL stablecoin exchange Saber and DeFi protocol Sunny had made up about 70% of the total value locked on the Solana blockchain at its peak were operated by the Macalinao brothers, citing a report from CoinDesk. With all of these gone and no new money being injected into the ecosystem by Bankman-Fried, Solana is now in a freefall of its own making. Additionally, Matrixport announced that it would be delisting all Solana products on Dec. 30, dealing another blow to the already struggling network. SOL price falls to single digit for first time in 22 months | Source: SOLUSD on TradingView.com SOL To Recover From Single-Digits? This week, the price of SOL dropped below the $10 level for the first time in almost two years. It is now sitting at its lowest point since February 2021, which was the last time that Solana had seen single-digit prices before the bull market took over. However, even with the digital asset dropping so low, it is unlikely that the decline is over. One thing to always note is how badly cryptocurrencies tend to perform in their first bear cycle, even bitcoin and ethereum weren’t exempted.

The Central Bank of Turkey (CBRT) has conducted the first tests of its Turkish digital lira.  According to a statement released on Thursday, the CBRT successfully carried out the first payment transactions on its central bank digital currency (CBDC) network as part of an initial test phase.  “In the first quarter of 2023, the CBRT will continue its small-scale, closed-loop application pilot tests conducted with technological stakeholders. The test results will be made public in a comprehensive evaluation report,” the bank said in the statement.  In 2023, the Turkish digital lira will move to advanced stages where the central bank will conduct pilot tests with broad participation, including banks and financial technology companies, the CBRT added.  “Studies on the legal dimension of the digital Turkish lira show that digital identification is of vital importance for the project.

42421405,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXo3TB,1672330310,How Tether Can Be a More Stable Stablecoin,"The crypto economy has suffered two major crypto failures this year: the collapse of Luna/TerraUSD in May and the failure of FTX in November. In both instances, the world's largest stablecoin, Tether, was caught in the blast radius as waves of redemptions poured into the company. It shrunk by $18 billion, or 21%, in May and June and by another $4 billion, or 6%, in November.  Stablecoins shouldn't be the instruments that the public sells in a panic. They're supposed to be the opposite; the life vest that people grab on to. Competing stablecoins USD Coin and Binance USD performed as one would have expected. Neither experienced a barrage of redemptions during these two episodes.  J.P. Koning, a CoinDesk columnist, worked as an equity researcher at a Canadian brokerage firm and a financial writer at a large Canadian bank. He runs the popular Moneyness blog. This article is part of CoinDesk's Crypto 2023 series.  Here are four things that Tether can do to ensure that the next time the crypto economy undergoes a shock, tether stays steady.  1) Tether needs to get rid of its corporate bonds, funds and ""other investments.""  A stablecoin's number one job is to be steady, and that demands holding safe assets like cash and Treasury bills. But some of the line items on Tether's balance sheet – including commercial paper, corporate bonds and funds, secured loans and ""other investments” – suggest that Tether operates more like a hedge fund or venture capital firm than a stablecoin.  Tether has been slowly addressing this problem. It spent much of 2022 replacing its massive $30 billion horde of commercial paper with Treasury bills, finally bringing the tally down to zero just prior to the FTX catastrophe.  But even after this cleansing, Tether still suffered from a wave of redemptions in November. Realizing it hadn't gone far enough, Tether executives made a pledge earlier this month to reduce its $6 billion in secured loans to zero.  That's great, but the company has been silent on what many analysts consider to be its sketchiest assets: its $2.6 billion in other investments and $3 billion or so in corporate bonds and funds. What is the rating and duration of these corporate bonds? Who are the borrowers – are they crypto firms? Are its other investments and funds composed of crypto-specific tokens?  Fear that these investments could sour is the best explanation for why the last two general cryptocurrency panics have inspired temporary runs on Tether. Best to get out of Tether now, goes the thinking, in case the company no longer has enough funds on hand to redeem all Tether tokens.  To put an end to this pattern, Tether needs to sell all of its risky assets and move to a 100% safe-asset allocation. Next time a crisis hits, users will be less likely to unload their Tether tokens.  Read more: 10 Predictions for the Future of Crypto in 2023 | Opinion  2) Tether needs to cancel its 0.1% redemption/withdrawal fee.  While the prices of competing stablecoins Binance USD and USD Coin are well-anchored to $1 on major exchanges around the globe, the price of Tether tends to fluctuate randomly. This lack of stability hurts the company’s reputation. At heart is Tether's 0.1% redemption fee. Time to get rid of it.  Tether charges anyone who wants to redeem or withdraw Tether tokens a 0.1% fee. So if you own 1 million tether tokens and want to redeem them, you'll only get $999,000 back after paying the $1,000 fee to Tether. Likewise, if you wire $1 million in fiat to Tether in order to get stablecoins, you'll only get $999,000 USD back.  The other big stablecoin issuers, Circle and Paxos, do not charge these fees.  It may not sound like much, but the 0.1% fee leads to the price of tether weaving randomly in a wide band around $1 rather than staying locked.  The price at which any stablecoin trades on exchanges like Binance and Kraken is set by arbitrage. If the price falls too low below $1, arbitrageurs buy stablecoins on the exchange and transfer them to their issuers for redemption at $1, earning a small profit. They execute the inverse when a stablecoin’s price is too high.  Competition among arbitrageurs to execute these trades at a profit is what locks the price of stablecoins on key exchanges at a price close to $1.  Tether's 0.1% fee adds to an arbitrageur's costs of carrying out this trade. Factoring in this cost, it only really becomes profitable to buy tether tokens when they've fallen to $0.999, and sell them when they've risen to $1.001. Tether’s price randomly floats within this relatively wide band.  This lack of rigidity attracts bad press, rumors, innuendo and speculation. It makes Tether look particularly bad during broader crypto meltdowns when its price inevitably falls to the bottom of its trading band, mirroring the performance of other risky crypto tokens rather than holding strong at $1. Meanwhile, other stablecoins like USD Coin and Binance USD, which don't have redemption fees, hold strong.  It's time for Tether to get rid of this fee in order to create more confidence-inspiring trading patterns on third-party exchanges.  See also: 2023: The Year of Regulation vs. Decentralization | Opinion  3) Tether needs to open redemptions up to more people by removing its $100,000 floor.  Tether is unique among stablecoins in putting a $100,000 floor on the amount of tether that can be redeemed or withdrawn at source. Other stablecoin issuers like Circle and Paxos allow people to withdraw or deposit any amount.  This floor creates perverse trading patterns on exchanges like Binance and Kraken, which further exacerbate fears about Tether.  In short, Tether's $100,000 minimum pushes the majority of USDT users who want to sell en-masse on exchanges. In theory, well-heeled arbitrageurs are supposed to buy these users' unwanted tokens on these exchanges and redeem them at Tether, thus anchoring Tether's price close to $1.  But it is precisely during broad crypto panics that this arbitrage mechanism breaks down: arbitrageurs back off out of fear of losing their capital, exchanges halt withdrawals as activity overwhelms them, and blockchains get congested. And so panicked on-exchange sales of tether overwhelm the mechanisms that are supposed to anchor tether, and its price falls below the lower end of its $0.999 band.  Far below. In May, Tether fell to 92 cents on Kraken. In October, it fell to under 93 cents. These depegging events engender more fear, leading to more sales of tether, leading to larger declines in price and more panic.  If Tether removed its $100,000 minimum and allowed everyone to redeem at source, then tether users wouldn't have to flock en masse to exchanges in order to offload their tether. They could simply send their 100 tether directly to the company and get $100.  This would relieve price pressure on exchanges and bring an end to Tether's crazy on-exchange price movements.  Read more: Crypto's Responsibility to Law Enforcement in 2023 and Beyond | Opinion  4) Tether needs to be more transparent.  Lack of transparency is an old criticism of Tether, but it deserves to be re-enunciated. Tether falls short of the current standard for stablecoin transparency. This lack of transparency helps create a trust gap that leads to Tether selloffs during market panics.  The stablecoin industry's current transparency standard has been established by the New York Department of FInancial services (NYDFS). Auditors attest to the state of the stablecoin's investments on a monthly basis, these reports being published on the issuers' websites. In addition to an end of month test of an issuers’ investments, the NYDFS requires stablecoins operating under its framework to be tested on one random day during the course of the month.  That's 24 tests per year. Alas, Tether reports on a quarterly basis. So its auditor is only testing the company’s investments four times per year. That's not good enough.  The NYDFS also requires stablecoin issuers to have an auditor examine its internal controls once a year. Internal controls are the rules and procedures that companies adopt to prevent mistakes and fraud such as separation of duties, verification of invoices and controlled access to financial reporting systems.  Tether's auditor has not examined the company's internal controls.  By bringing its disclosure practices up to industry standard, Tether will grow trust and users will be less likely to dump Tether tokens come the next crypto panic.  To sum up, tether has become that stablecoin that everyone sells when panic hits. But this doesn’t have to be the case. By selling its risky assets and only holding safe t-bills, removing its 0.1% redemption fee, allowing all users to redeem at source and improving transparency, tether can transition into a much more stable stablecoin.",NEUTRAL,USDT,EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING | USDT | BNB,JP Koning,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/12/29/how-tether-can-be-a-more-stable-stablecoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/34d9c325c8b9a655947656136d75dfd1e572479c-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin Interexchange Flow Pulse Is Crossing Over Its 90-Day MA As per CryptoQuant’s on-chain year-end dashboard release, the trend shifts in this metric have historically occurred with phase changes in the market. The “Interexchange Flow Pulse” is an indicator that measures the 1-year cumulative net flows between Coinbase and derivative exchanges. When the value of this metric rises, it means investors are transferring more coins from spot to derivative exchanges right now, and are hence willing to take up more risk. On the other hand, low values suggest not much capital is flowing into the derivative exchanges at the moment. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Interexchange Flow Pulse, as well as its 90-day moving average (MA), over the last few years: Looks like the value of the metric may be beginning to turn around | Source: CryptoQuant As you can see in the above graph, a pattern seems to have historically followed with the Bitcoin Interexchange Flow Pulse during bull-bear trends in the price of the crypto. Whenever the coin has observed a bullish period, the indicator has seen a constant climb and has stayed above its 90-day MA. Related Reading: Litecoin Bullish Signal: Shark And Whale Addresses Hit 2-Year High The reason behind this is that investors are generally willing to take more risk during bull markets, and hence send increasingly large amounts to derivative exchanges for setting up leverage positions. However, whenever the metric has reversed its direction and crossed below the 90-day MA, a top formation has taken place in the price of BTC, and the bullish trend has ended. In the bear markets that have followed such periods, the Interexchange Flow Pulse has usually continued to go down and has remained below its 3-month average. Once again, why this happens is simple; bear markets are when the average holder is unwilling to take any risks, and hence capital flow into derivatives dries up. This trend in the indicator continues until the turning point once again takes place, where the price forms its bottom and the metric starts moving back up the opposite way (crossing above its 90-day MA in the process). Related Reading: Bitcoin Might Be Going Through Its “Most Challenging” Cycle Based On This Metric In the current bear market as well, the Bitcoin Interexchange Flow Pulse has consistently moved down while staying under its 90-day MA. Most recently, however, the decline seems to have stopped, and now the indicator is retesting its long-term average.

42417073,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcRpOcn,1672326025,Making Comprehensive Crypto Policy Out of Regulatory Patchwork,"Even as cryptocurrency and other digital assets resident on blockchain have increasingly permeated the public consciousness, the question of regulatory authority has largely gone unanswered. Often, seismic events in the financial industry, like the collapse of FTX, lead to clarity.  Here, unfortunately, instead of leading to any kind of consensus, the early signs indicate that the demise of FTX and its repercussions on other crypto companies have only reinforced the disagreements between the different stakeholders on how, or even whether, to regulate crypto.  Aitan Goelman is a partner with Zuckerman Spaeder, LLP and the former Director of Enforcement at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. This article is part of Crypto 2023.  By now, most people are familiar with the saga of FTX and Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder, majority owner, and, until recently, wunderkind CEO of the now-defunct crypto exchange. Before his abrupt fall from grace, “SBF,” as Bankman-Fried has become known, had the ear of public officials, regulators and celebrities, and a public image as the kinder, gentler, face of crypto.  After a November 2022 article in Coindesk reported that the bulk of the holdings of Alameda Research, SBF’s trading firm, were in FTX’s token, a run on the bank was triggered. That led to SBF’s resignation and forced FTX and related entities into bankruptcy, with FTX’s customers and investors out billions of dollars. SBF was subsequently indicted in the Southern District of New York (S.D.N.Y.) for a variety of crimes, including wire fraud, conspiracy and money-laundering, stemming from his alleged use of assets belonging to FTX’s customers to plug a shortfall in Alameda and his alleged lies to investors.  Read more: 2023 Will Be the Death of Bitcoin Energy FUD | Opinion  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) filed enforcement actions against SBF as well, alleging that his actions violated the securities laws and the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), respectively.  Until FTX’s demise, it and SBF had been seen as the white knights of the crypto world, repeatedly riding to the rescue of other troubled companies in the sector. This made some contagion from FTX’s collapse inevitable, although to this point, the damage appears largely confined to other crypto companies, customers and investors, rather than to the traditional financial system.  It is worth noting that, while SBF is now incarcerated and faces a potentially lengthy prison term and unfavorable comparisons to Bernie Madoff, he had previously been a champion of increased regulation of the crypto markets, including by lending his support to proposed federal legislation which would have undoubtedly prohibited much of his conduct, including the use of customer funds to prop up Alameda.  Pre-FTX regulatory status  There has never been a dedicated regulator of crypto, at least in the U.S. Various federal agencies, including the Department of Treasury, the SEC and the CFTC, each have different pieces of regulatory responsibility. Certain state agencies have carved out roles for themselves as well, with the New York Department of Financial Services, for example, issuing its own “BitLicenses.”  In this patchwork of different regulatory authority, the legal basis for the CFTC’s jurisdiction is clearest. The Commission has repeatedly held that crypto can be a commodity under § 1(a)(9) of the CEA, which falls under its regulatory umbrella, and this interpretation has been endorsed by federal courts as well. As a result, the CFTC has asserted its regulatory authority over crypto derivatives, and its anti-fraud and anti-manipulation enforcement authority over transactions in spot crypto.  There has been considerably less consistency in the SEC’s approach to crypto. In the last administration, the SEC seemed relatively uninterested in crypto. Its only notable effort was to belatedly take action against the spate of Initial Coin Offerings (ICO), which were fairly clearly unregistered securities offerings, but eschewing any attempt to more broadly regulate crypto.  The SEC has been far more aggressive under Chair Gensler, who has repeatedly suggested that the vast majority of tokens are securities. Gensler’s Enforcement Division has launched a host of investigations into different tokens and has adopted an expensive interpretation of “investment contracts” under SEC v. Howey, 328 U.S. 293 (1946).  See also: The Next Wave of Institutional Digital Asset Adoption | Opinion  Despite this, the SEC’s ability to show that these tokens are actually securities under current law is far from certain. The agency did manage to persuade a New Hampshire district court that the cryptocurrency LBRY was a security. However, it is facing a stiff challenge in SEC v. Ripple, 20 CIV 10832 (S.D.N.Y. 2020), where the defense, led by former SEC Chair Mary Jo White and former Enforcement Director Andrew Ceresney, are arguing that Ripple’s token is not a security by using public statements (and, now, internal SEC communications) made by another former top SEC official, William Hinman, about why Ether did not qualify as an “investment contract” under Howey.  This has resulted in an unusually public turf battle between the CFTC and SEC, and even led CFTC Commissioner Caroline D. Pham to issue a statement condemning the SEC’s decision to bring charges in SEC v. Wahi. Quoting Federalist No. 49, Commissioner Pham called the SEC action “a striking example of ‘regulation by enforcement,’” and encouraged the CFTC to use “all means available” to enforce the CEA in the crypto space.  In this regard, the SBF charges can be seen as a victory for CFTC. Although the SEC charged SBF with securities fraud, it is related to lies he told to FTX investors, something that is inarguably in the SEC’s wheelhouse. The SEC did not allege that the underlying crypto itself – FTT – was a security, while both the CFTC and the S.D.N.Y. alleged that crypto is a commodity.  All three agencies subsequently filed consent charges against SBF’s accomplices and confidantes Caroline Ellison and Gary Wang, both of whom are cooperating with the government against SBF.  Notably, the SEC did charge Ellison and Wang with manipulating FTT, which the agency described as a “crypto asset security.” The CFTC didn’t address the legal status of FTT in particular, but cited bitcoin, ether and tether as examples of “digital asset commodities.”  This pattern of charges could indicate the early outlines of an agreed-upon division between the agencies for tokens that are considered “securities” and those that are not, with the SEC claiming jurisdiction over the former and the CFTC over the latter.  However, the fact that the SEC defined FTT as a “security” in its charges against Ellison and Yang, but not in its case against SBF, demonstrates that the agency is bolder in pressing its expansive definition of “crypto asset securities” when it knows it won’t have to fight that issue in front of a judge.  Proposals to fill the regulatory gaps  Prior to FTX’s implosion, there seemed to be an emerging consensus (or something close to it) that Congress should establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto. This included the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), which in October 2022 recommended that Congress pass legislation to provide federal regulators with rule-making authority over the spot market for “crypto assets that are not securities.”  The FSOC did not say which regulator should be given such authority, but it appears that it had the CFTC in mind. Further, securities were excluded from the recommended regulatory authority, a move that clearly seemed designed to reassure the SEC that there would be no encroachment on its territory.  There are two major pieces of draft crypto legislation circulating on the Hill, and both explicitly provide the CFTC with regulatory authority over large parts of the spot crypto markets.  The Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act (“DCCPA”), introduced in August by Senators Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and John Boozman (R-AR), extends the CFTC’s regulatory authority to spot crypto. While the bill defines certain cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, as commodities, it offers no detailed guidance on what crypto assets would be classified as “securities,” which the bill exempts from CFTC jurisdiction.  To pass, this bill will have to overcome SBF’s earlier public endorsement – a boon at the time, but now may taint the legislation by association.  The Responsible Financial Innovation Act (RFIA), sponsored by Senators Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), goes even further toward endorsing the CFTC as the primary crypto regulator. It gives the agency oversight over digital assets that are not securities and lays out fairly restrictive standards for determining that a crypto asset is a security.  The senators noted in a joint press release that “understanding that most digital assets are much more similar to commodities than securities, the bill gives the CFTC clear authority over applicable digital asset spot markets” – leaving little doubt as to their intent and openly differing with Chair Gensler’s public statements.  Beyond these differences, the two bills have many provisions in common. Both would allow the CFTC to self-fund by imposing user fees on crypto companies, an ability which mimics an authority the SEC has long had and which could be a game changer for the perpetually cash-strapped agency.  The last time Congress significantly expanded the CFTC’s responsibilities – when the Dodd-Frank bill brought swaps under the agency’s ambit after the financial crisis of 2008-09 – the CFTC’s budget did not keep pace with its enlarged remit.  The ability to impose user fees would help ensure that the CFTC, whose budget (about $320 million) is still a rounding error compared to that of the SEC (approximately $2 billion), can effectively carry out its enhanced mission.  Another feature shared by both pieces of draft legislation is the establishment of a new self-regulatory organization (SRO) exclusively for the crypto markets. This is something former CFTC Chair Tim Massad has said should be done regardless of what happens in Congress, and he has suggested that it be overseen jointly by the SEC and CFTC.  The Impact of FTX  The collapse of FTX and its knock-on effects in the broader crypto industry has led to renewed calls for urgent action by Congress. But it hasn’t led to unanimity, or even consensus, about the need for legislation, much less how to regulate the industry.  Instead, it has largely reinforced the positions already held by the various stakeholders. SEC Chair Gensler has used the FTX saga to reiterate his position that the SEC already has regulatory authority over most coins, and it simply needs more money to do the job.  In contrast, CFTC Chair Benham, in congressional testimony soon after FTX declared bankruptcy, noted that the CFTC-regulated American subsidiary of FTX (FTX US Derivatives – once known as LedgerX) was still solvent, demonstrating the effectiveness of CFTC supervision.  Crypto enthusiasts reacted to the implosion of FTX by arguing that there are fraudsters in every industry. Some also noted that centralized exchanges like FTX are in many ways the antithesis of the ethos of crypto, which was intended to be a decentralized form of finance independent of the need to trust in institutions or other market participants.  Unsurprisingly, the FTX saga hasn’t dented the faith of true crypto zealots, who continue to believe with almost religious ferocity that Web3 and blockchain represent one of the most consequential developments in human history – more important than the development of the internet, approximately equal to the discovery of fire, and perhaps slightly behind the invention of the wheel.  More surprisingly, some hardcore crypto skeptics are pointing to the very limited contagion from the FTX collapse as evidence that crypto should not be regulated. They argue that if crypto is brought into the mainstream financial system, it would have the imprimatur of government approval and this would encourage more retail investors to speculate in crypto. As a result, the entire economy would be exposed to the volatility, money laundering, fraud and manipulation that are ubiquitous in (and, to some crypto haters, an inextricable part of) crypto.  This regulatory debate illustrates the adage that “where you stand depends on where you sit.” Chairman Gensler, who was an aggressive proponent of the CFTC’s remit when he chaired that agency during the Obama Administration, now believes that virtually all crypto qualifies as a “security.” And then you have the chair and enforcement director of the SEC during the same administration, who are representing Ripple in its battle against the SEC and are among those arguing for a more limited interpretation of a “security.”  Meanwhile, crypto companies continue to avoid U.S. jurisdiction. They do so primarily by moving offshore (the headquarters of FTX, like many crypto firms, was in the Bahamas) and by “geo-blocking” Americans, a technique that prohibits those the computer identifies as being located in the U.S. from accessing their platforms – but this is, of course, a far from hermetic seal against anyone with a VPN.  The absence of legislation and regulation doesn’t mean the law surrounding crypto is stagnant – it continues to develop through litigation and the interpretation of various enforcement actions. But true clarity won’t come through the slow churn of the legal system, it will come through legislative action. Ironically, FTX’s collapse has, in some ways, complicated the path to Congressional action.  In addition to the now-poisonous association with SBF, both draft bills are under renewed criticism for granting primary regulatory jurisdiction to the CFTC instead of the SEC.  But suggestions that the CFTC is the crypto industry’s “regulator of choice” and more susceptible to capture by the industry simply don’t hold up against the facts. In 2022, more than 20% of the agency’s enforcement actions were related to crypto. Further, the CFTC sought – and, more often than not, successfully obtained – increasingly significant sanctions.  Under its current funding structure, the agency undoubtedly does not have the resources to be fully effective. However, if any legislation retains a grant to the CFTC of authority to levy user fees on crypto actors, the agency’s efforts in the crypto sector will be even more robust.",NEGATIVE,FTT,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | FTT | TOKEN SALE,Aitan Goelman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/12/29/making-comprehensive-crypto-policy-out-of-regulatory-patchwork,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/10ef8d82046a3464a172501a5af6260a62d60ceb-2048x1292.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42417080,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcRpOl3,1672325489,Zero-Knowledge Cryptography in 2023: The Year Privacy Becomes Practical,"One of the technologies that will undoubtedly change Web3 is zero-knowledge (ZK) cryptography. ZK has long been considered a potential game-changer for ensuring the privacy, security and integrity of blockchain applications. The rapid investment and development of zero-knowledge proofs is an important signal that the technology is getting ready for prime time.  I have four primary predictions for where the technology will go in 2023, in addition to the players, projects and protocols that will drive – and capture – the most value.  Alex Pruden is the CEO of Aleo and founder of ZPrize. This article is part of Crypto 2023.  A ZK-powered layer 1 smart-contract blockchain chain will launch in 2023  While a few chains – including Mina, ZCash and Celo – already use zero-knowledge cryptography in production, none of them provide true programmability or full on-chain smart contract functionality. As a result, they are limited in what they can do. But that’s changing.  A smart-contract blockchain running a ZK-powered virtual machine will launch next year. This might be in the design of Zexe, the behind-the-radar ledger-based system, or otherwise. Zcash, which recently had an upgrade using advanced zero-knowledge science, is also far more scalable and being used for real applications.  Building a new layer 1 blockchain from the ground up with all the right primitives in place is easier than trying to adapt Ethereum or other blockchains to a technology it wasn’t initially designed for. Ethereum certainly has the most significant traction among smart-contract developers, but it isn’t the only game in town and investors, users and developers are all still in the market for alternatives.  A ZK-focused chain may be impacted by the lack of ZK-native coders. However, when Ethereum first launched, many questioned whether anyone would want to learn a whole new language to write smart contracts. It turned out that many were, given the benefits of the new paradigm. The same will be true of a ZK layer 1.  Moreover, a ZK-native smart contract platform will provide both scalability and privacy. Most rollup designs today only address scalability concerns, even if they have ZK in their name. Both privacy and scalability will be essential to enable use cases that unlock the true value of Web3.  Rollups will remain centralized, and zkEVMs will remain impractical  Several rollup implementations – both ZK and Optimistic – are live on Ethereum today. All of them rely on a single, centralized party known as a sequencer to order transactions. And while the design of a rollup ensures that the sequencer cannot steal funds, the sequencer learns all of the information about your transactions and has the opportunity to profit from MEV [maximal extractable value] at your expense.  The challenge of decentralizing a rollup is both a technical and legal one. From a technical perspective, decentralizing a sequencer essentially requires launching a whole new blockchain, but without an asset that provides economic security. From a legal point of view, it’s difficult to decentralize the sequencer in a way that isn’t obviously a security (e.g., a portion of transaction fees will be paid to the sequencer).  The additional challenge for ZK rollups is that they do not offer full smart-contract functionality. Various zk-based Ethereum Virtual Machines (EVM) with varying levels of compatibility to Ethereum have been proposed but are still very much theoretical. So while Zero-Knowledge cryptography has come a long way, the engineering challenges of a zkEVM still put a decentralized, production system at least a year away.  See also: Ethereum's Rollup Race: What is a 'True' zkEVM?  Hardware acceleration will make ZK more practical, useful and accessible across the board  One of the most promising trends for Zero-Knowledge cryptography is hardware acceleration. When we think back to the early days of the Web, it was the integration of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), a cryptography instruction set designed by Intel, that enabled the ubiquity of internet-based communication protocol https.  Over the course of this past year, there has been a significant focus on hardware acceleration for zkSNARKs, from FPGAs [field-programmable gate arrays] to mobile phones. In particular, the ZPrize competition galvanized interest in applying and consolidating the most cutting-edge optimizations for generating zero-knowledge proofs in hardware.  This was notable because it was not just the initiative of a single team, but a collective industry effort comprising over 32 companies including semiconductor companies AMD and Samsung and Web3 players Mina, Aztec, Aleo and 0xPARC.  The outcome of the competition (which I helped organize) increased the performance of core Zero-Knowledge algorithms. These results are broadly applicable across the field and accessible to anyone through open source.  Read more: Adoption of DeFi, ZK Tech, NFTs and More Will Continue to Increase in 2023  Using the ZPrize submissions, real applications powered by Zero Knowledge such as stablecoins, privacy-preserving machine learning, digital identity and gaming solutions will become practical. We could see an example of a product in those categories as early as this year.  Companies will have to choose a side on privacy  People are realizing the limitations of public blockchains and in particular, the amount of information you must reveal to participate. The status quo is everything public by default, which creates a system in which consumer protection is impossible.  Of course, plenty of companies state they support developing features to help ensure user privacy. But both consumers and regulations will increasingly force the industry to pick a side. Senator Elizabeth Warren’s (D–Mass.) hastily introduced financial surveillance bill only makes it more necessary that the industry work together to counter this.  The issue is urgent. Web3 companies that truly hold the values of the space will take a stand to defend the rights of users and use technology like Zero-Knowledge cryptography to ensure they are protected. If we don’t, we risk creating a global financial panopticon that is far more invasive than our current financial system.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | ZRX | ZK,Alex  Pruden,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/12/29/zero-knowledge-cryptography-in-2023-the-year-privacy-becomes-practical,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f7553eca8e7b74cc4cdafaf80d37a36a87ffa2ea-2286x1311.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

6642015,https://newsbtc.com/?p=514127,1672324246,"14 Crypto Law Predictions For 2023, According To Delphi Labs General Counsel","Gabriel Shapiro, the legal counsel at crypto company Delphi Labs and a US attorney with more than a decade of experience, has made his predictions for the coming year 2023. However, contrary to the crypto tradition of predicting the most lucrative altcoins, Shapiro is making his predictions in terms of US crypto law. The year 2022 was undoubtedly one of the most turbulent years for the crypto industry, which had to cope with the collapse of numerous fraudulent and overleveraged companies. The collapse of FTX and its entanglements in U.S. politics, at the latest, should give U.S. lawmakers ample reasons to regulate the crypto industry more tightly in the year ahead. In this regard, Shapiro predicts that a money laundering issue will be uncovered on a national level related to cryptocurrencies. For example, “FTX could be revealed to be connected with Iran-Contra style arms smuggling to Ukraine.” (1) at least one major crypto project will register its existing token or smart contract system as a security with the SEC as part of a comprehensive pre-trial settlement — _gabrielShapir0 (@lex_node) December 28, 2022 Regarding centralized exchanges, Shapiro suspects that a CEX bankruptcy will expose a major mistake by a prestigious law firm. Under regulatory pressure from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the lawyer says, “at least one major crypto project will register its existing token or smart contract system as a security with the SEC as part of a comprehensive pre-litigation settlement.” Related Reading: Institutional Crypto Predictions For 2023: Ethereum, BTC, L2s, NFTs Shapiro also predicts that one to three new crypto projects will seek registration with the SEC as securities. Moreover, legislative pressure may not stop at the DeFi sector. In terms of anti-money laundering and KYC guidelines, Shapiro says at least one project will bow to the pressure and introduce CEX-style customer verification. Given the tremendous growth in popularity of stablecoins and the increasingly debated introduction of a central bank digital currency (CBDC), Shapiro’s sixth prediction should come as a surprise to few. The attorney believes that a “meaningless stablecoin law will be passed for stablecoins in custody,” leaving it up to the Treasury Department to shape the rules. This could “pave the way for Circle to receive permanent structural advantages,” Shapiro said. Crypto Law Predictions For DeFi, NFTs, And Ethereum Shapiro also expects more regulatory pressure for DAOs, which could face a wave of lawsuits from the CFTC and SEC. The attorney also expects a lawsuit from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which “could file a serious claim” against a DeFi team for “misrepresentations” about how it operates. The DeFi space is also concerned with the next prediction: The CFTC publishes direct or indirect guidance on DeFi that indicates fully overcollateralized MakerDAO style vaults will not be viewed as leveraged transactions, but that everything else in DeFi is covered by CFTC regs; most fancy DeFi applications block the U.S. Flying under the radar for another year, on the other hand, could be MEV, GameFi, bridges, L2s, and zk-proofs, according to Shapiro. Major IP problems are expected by Delphi Labs’ legal counsel for existing NFT-PFP projects, which are “declining dramatically in value amidst numerous lawsuits and investigations; other uses for NFT with better legal engineering emerge.” Related Reading: Litecoin Price Prediction: This Resistance Could Trigger New Rally U.S. regulators, meanwhile, could focus on Ethereum ecosystem infrastructure providers. “At least one major U.S.-based Ethereum ecosystem infrastructure provider will add KYC/AML or other previously unthinkable compliance features to the base layer,” Shapiro continued. ICOs, Binance, USDT, And Coinbase The lawyer’s penultimate prediction relates to ICOs, which could make a comeback under the MiCA framework in the EU. “[T]his combined with a higher-interest-rate environment will mark a new cycle where VCs are less powerful in crypto.” In the end, Shapiro holds an optimistic prediction for Binance, Bitfinex, and Tether, which he says will enter lightweight regulatory arrangements outside the U.S. and gain a surprising degree of international legitimacy. In contrast, he predicts that Coinbase will merge with U.S. investment banks and become a “U.S.-favored juggernaut.” At press time, the Coinbase (COIN) share price was trading at $32.53, down 90.5% from its all-time high.

42421410,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXo3ZN,1672321500,"No, Advisors, Crypto Is Not a Ponzi Scheme","Since crypto exchange FTX collapsed into bankruptcy and its Ponzi-like shell game with investor money was revealed, many commentators have doubled down on their criticism of cryptocurrencies as a type of Ponzi scheme.  For those who need a review, Ponzi schemes start with an initial investment from an early round of investors, and the money is then used (and spent) for the purposes of the general partners or issuers of the investment product. When the time comes that the original investors want to withdraw their funds, their investments are returned through funds invested by subsequent rounds of investors, giving the illusion of solvency and returns.  Similarly, FTX kept making funds available to earlier investors on its exchange using the deposits of subsequent investors – those earlier investments had been swept away to Alameda Research, an affiliated hedge fund.  You're reading Crypto for Advisors, a weekly look at digital assets and the future of finance for financial advisors. Subscribe here to receive the mailing every Thursday.  The FTX revelations have led a chorus of voices – including actor Ben McKenzie and Nobel Laureate economist Paul Krugman – to allege that cryptocurrencies in general are a Ponzi scheme.  Why crypto isn’t a Ponzi scheme  Let’s be clear: Though bad actors are using cryptocurrencies as a medium with which to conduct Ponzi-like schemes, crypto itself isn't a Ponzi scheme.  For one thing, tokens like bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) do hold value, even in down markets and don't depend on inflows of new money to pay off investors. Rather, holders of these tokens can exchange them for other items of value, or fiat currency, any time they can find a counterparty willing to take their crypto.  There is no central entity giving these tokens the illusion of value, but instead, the investing public’s willingness to pay $17,000 or $21,000 or $68,000 for one bitcoin determines the ultimate market value of the token.  The most popular cryptocurrencies are able to deliver value in and of themselves without the manipulations of a Ponzi scheme operator.  What crypto tokens can do  And as a reminder to financial advisors, cryptocurrencies do have fundamentals and real-world use cases.  Here are a handful of functions that cryptocurrencies provide:  1. Medium of exchange  As 2022 comes to a close, cryptocurrencies can be used as a medium of exchange at hundreds of retailers, including AMC Theatres, Virgin Galactic and Cheap Air. Many of these retailers use BitPay, a service that for a small fee converts crypto into the currency of a vendor’s choice within the flow of a transaction.  Holders of bitcoin can also convert their coins into fiat cash at bitcoin ATMs or via a debit card prepaid with their tokens.  And while many people argue that the volatility of bitcoin and other popular cryptocurrencies makes them unfit as a medium of exchange, stablecoins that don't fluctuate in value are on the rise.  The reputation of stablecoins was tested this year with the collapse of some “algorithmic” stablecoins like Terra/UST. However, they still have the potential to overtake paper currency by accommodating fast, safe and precise digital payments. Central banks are taking this challenge seriously by working to develop digital currencies of their own.  2. Foreign exchange  Using tokens for cross-border remittances continues to be one of the more popular uses for cryptocurrencies.  While many critics have lambasted the volatility and uncertainty of cryptocurrencies compared with fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, many other international currencies suffer from high volatility and inflationary pressures far beyond those felt by the dollar.  Tokens like bitcoin are still able to move across borders faster and cheaper than fiat currency.  3. Decentralized applications (dapps)  Blockchain technology and digital tokens are being applied to problems far beyond those involving investors, advisors, exchanges and digital broker-dealers.  The technology is being applied to issues in real estate, agriculture, healthcare, gaming and supply-chain management, among others.  Tokens, distributed through initial coin offerings, are programmable assets that use smart contracts to automatically execute transactions if certain conditions are met without the need of an intermediary. Many industries, not just financial, can benefit from smart contracts that eliminate the need for intermediaries.  4. Yield  In 2022, Ethereum, the blockchain represented by ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, underwent a transformation from a proof-of-work blockchain to a proof-of-stake blockchain, offering holders of ether the opportunity to generate yield by “staking” transactions on the blockchain. As a result, it has become much easier for many crypto investors to take some income out of their holdings without selling a position.  But so-called “yield-farming” opportunities have existed for several years in decentralized finance (DeFi). While some of these opportunities are rife with risk and potential fraud, others offer investors the chance to receive more income more efficiently than they would via low-risk stocks and bonds – even in the current higher interest rate regime.  5. Investment diversification  Many investors are going to bet that blockchain will continue to proliferate and that the demand for cryptocurrencies will increase again, driving prices upward from their 2022 swoon. While these may often be pie-in-the-sky hopes for easy money, some credible analysts also expect that the value of major tokens like bitcoin and ether will eventually begin to rise, perhaps growing beyond the peaks reached over a year ago.  While advisors generally promote long-term investing over get-rich-quick speculation, for younger clients with high incomes or very high net worth, a little speculation on the potential growth of digital assets shouldn't seriously detract from their ability to reach long-term financial goals.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TOKEN SALE,Christopher Robbins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/12/29/no-advisors-crypto-is-not-a-ponzi-scheme,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8381ab978eb5982bdc4aae1d49faa79e85c1633b-4680x3858.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The exchange abruptly halted its Gemini Earn program in November, ""effectively wiping out"" investors who still had holdings, according to the court filing. The investors say Gemini's Earn program – which offered interest of up to 7.4% to customers for lending their crypto assets – didn't register those assets as securities in accordance with U.S. law. They are seeking a trial by jury, according to the complaint.  Several tokens held by Sam Bankman-Fried’s embattled trading business Alameda Research were sold late on Wednesday to the tune of millions of dollars, as the firm's founders face criminal charges. On-chain data cited by Arkham Intelligence suggested $1.7 million worth of tokens from Alameda-linked wallets was sold in the open market over a span of several hours on Wednesday. The sales triggered concerns on Crypto Twitter about a potentially steep fall in the prices of those tokens.  China is launching its first state-backed non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace, the latest sign of embrace for a technology that has occupied a legal gray area within the country’s notoriously strict regulations on cryptocurrency. A ceremony celebrating the launch of the marketplace will be held in Beijing on Jan. 1.

6637991,https://newsbtc.com/?p=514124,1672319177,Dogecoin Breaking Past This Key Barrier Could Spell 10% Spike For DOGE,"Dogecoin (DOGE) is one of the meme coins that is often underestimated, primarily because of its extremely high volatility and low utility value. DOGE has trimmed off 8% of its value Dogecoin bulls aim to trigger price rally DOGE among most searched crypto DOGE has sloughed roughly 8% off the coin’s value in the last week, which plunged from $0.07751 to $0.06932. On the brighter side, bulls could trigger a price rally towards $0.07752. According to data by Coingecko, DOGE price has nosedived by 0.5% in the last 24 hours, and trading at $0.0706 as of this writing. Related Reading: Why ALGO Has Been Stagnant In Last 10 Days And Still At The Mercy Of Bears DOGE To Breach Below Key Support Level DOGE is seen to breach below the key support line of $0.07109, which presents a buying opportunity with the discounted price. The key support line has been retested several times from November to December. However, can key support hold it enough to roll out a price rally? If this price can attract more buyers, then this could precipitate a price rally. During the following few trading days, the bulls may also attempt to break past the current barrier located at $0.07749, before they could gain 10%. DOGE is seen to have intensified further in terms of developmental activity, which also influenced the price increase but has dwindled in terms of investor interest. Despite DOGE being dubbed an underdog, the coin has outpaced other crypto assets in the market. In terms of price movement, Dogecoin is among the best performing memecoins in the 2022 bear market. Chart: TradingView.com DOGE’s Negative Sentiment Could Hinder Price Reversal DOGE’s MFI showing an uptick confirms the possibility of a price reversal. More so, RSI has also faced rejection each time it reaches the 30-level. Rejection of the trend by the RSI at this level may indicate a price reversal if the trend is sustained. Once it does, the DOGE bulls intensify, which could ultimately bolster a price turnaround. In the meantime, these levels can be treated as long-entry positions.

In the event that this support is breached, it will suggest that bears now have leverage, and it will invalidate the prognosis presented above. Meanwhile, many are generally concerned about whether or not the price of Dogecoin will ever reach $1 because it is currently trading at a consistently low level. The general opinion is that Dogecoin will almost certainly fare far better in the longer term in comparison to 2022. According to forecasts regarding the value of Dogecoin, its price is expected to reach $0.30 by the end of the current year, $0.77 by 2025, and $1 by 2030. Meanwhile, Dogecoin is one of the cryptocurrencies that has been searched the most this year, based on this report. – Featured image: The Motley Fool",NEUTRAL,ALGO | DOGE,ALGO | BUSINESS | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://newsbtc.com/all/dogecoin-could-spike-10/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/6637991.jpeg

After trading within a narrow region from May to November that saw it establish $0.28 as its range low, the cryptocurrency devalued by 34% in December and found itself going all the way down to $0.163 – a marker that ended up being the asset’s current support zone. ALGO, which has not made any significant increase in price in the last 10 days, is at the mercy of bears that are in control right now, threatening to push the digital coin’s value to $0.15 or even lower. Technical indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI) and On-Balance Volume (OBV) are also currently favoring sellers, indicating that Algorand is headed into another bearish trajectory.

Over the last 24 hours, the altcoin has gone down by almost 3% and is looking at a weekly decline of 4.7%. On longer time frames, Algorand has declined significantly, dumping 25.6% of its value during the last two weeks and also losing 30.4% over the last 30 days. Indeed, the cryptocurrency was among the many altcoins that struggled to gain their momentum back following the effects of the market-crashing collapse of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange.

6632206,https://newsbtc.com/?p=514098,1672311644,Bitcoin Will Outperform All Other Assets In 2023 Due To 3 Reasons: Report,"In a new report, Capriole Investments has posited that Bitcoin will outperform all other assets in the coming year due to three key reasons. One of those reasons, perhaps unsurprisingly to many, will be the currently all-defining U.S. Federal Reserve (FED). According to the company, the market is currently experiencing the most aggressive monetary policy since the 1980s. The annual rate of change in the M2 money supply is now negative for the first time ever, as shown by analyst Dylan LeClair yesterday. Uh guys, the money printer got jammed. pic.twitter.com/IimHwaoEaX — Dylan LeClair 🟠 (@DylanLeClair_) December 28, 2022 As Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards explained, the Federal Reserve has always lowered the federal funds rate in subsequent years when inflation exceeded 5% and then declined by more than 20%, as has been seen recently. Although in all cases, the inflation peak persisted for several more years. In 4 out of 5 cases, inflation normalized to the 2-3% range in the following years, while the FED fund rates declined there on out, as the chart below shows. “I expect this will be the golden decade for hard money,” Edwards continued and said that history suggests that further monetary tightening is not necessary, making it very likely that the Fed will pivot within the next six months. This would also be in line with the FED’s latest assessment, which forecasts an increase in rates by another 75 basis points, which could mean two steps (50 and 25 bps) or three steps (three times 25 bps). Related Reading: Institutional Crypto Predictions For 2023: Ethereum, BTC, L2s, NFTs Capriole Investments argues that the need for the FED to pivot in the next year will be due to a number of reasons. On the one hand, pressure on the economy is increasing, as evidenced by declining indexes, mass layoffs at tech companies, and sentiment in the housing market; on the other hand, debt will be a major driver: Higher rates for longer puts significant stress on the US Government to fund its liabilities. From the Government’s point of view, it’s much better to have a higher baseline inflation rate (say 2-4%) which helps to deplete relative debt burden over time. Bitcoin Is Harder Than Gold Capriole Investments compares today’s inflation spike to those in 1970 and 1975. “Both periods sparked huge gold bull-runs. From 1971-1975, gold rallied 450% and between 1977-1980 it shot up 800%,” as the firm notes. There are “compelling parallels” between today’s and the 1970s in terms of inflation trends. With Bitcoin being the “harder money” compared to gold, plus other advantages, Capriole Investments expects BTC to outperform its older competitor. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Grinds Lower, More Losses Seem Imminent Accordingly, a second key reason for Bitcoin’s massive strength in 2023 will be its upcoming halving in early 2024. Currently, BTC’s market capitalization is only 2.5% of gold’s market capitalization, which means upside potential of 3,739%. “In just over a year, Bitcoin will become the hardest asset in the world, with a programmed inflation rate less than half that of gold. Every Bitcoin halving has kick started a cyclical bull-market in digital assets. Yet every halving people expect that to be priced in,” Capriole Investment says. BTC Poised For A Bull Run In 2023 Looking at the fundamentals, Edwards notes that Bitcoin is trading within $100 of the Bitcoin bottom signals he gave in November. The all-important chart according to Edwards is that of Bitcoin’s cost of production, “Bitcoin continues to trade at the bottom of the cost of electricity. Incredibly rare, low value.” In conclusion, the investment firm predicts the 2020s will be the decade of hard money, similar to the 1970s. “For stock market investors, this could be called “a lost decade.” “If you agree, the only question left is which hard money will prevail,” Capriole says, going on to say that Bitcoin is poised to outperform gold because of three major advantages: It’s harder, it’s digital, and it’s 1/40 the size of gold, making it predestined for greater appreciation. At press time, the BTC price was still struggling to gain momentum, trading at $16,584.

42388312,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRDXal,1672306961,Solana Tokens Continue Steep Slide While Major Cryptos Stay Flat,"Crypto markets slid a nominal 0.8% in the past 24 hours as broader equity markets grappled with renewed coronavirus fears stemming from China.  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index and Japan’s Nikkei 225 had shed 1% as of Asian afternoon hours on Thursday, while the Shanghai Composite fell 0.44%. Stocks fell amid weakened risk appetite on one of the final trading days of the year, according to Bloomberg.  The bearish sentiment, however, didn't seem to affect major cryptocurrencies, with bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and several other major tokens such as polkadot (DOT), binance coin (BNB) and XRP (XRP) seeing nominal change.  Solana (SOL), however, dropped as much as 10% in the past 24 hours, adding to a 20% slide over the past week. Selling pressure on the tokens came because of their close links to disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, who faces charges of fraud and misappropriation of client funds.  Thursday's decline put SOL on track for nine straight days of losses, the longest run of declines since Sept. 17, 2021, based on Messari data.  Since 2020, Bankman-Fried has been a major proponent of the Solana network, launching the decentralized exchange Serum on the then-upstart network and investing heavily in the platform's projects.  Apart from prices, the value locked on Solana-based applications has declined 98% since November last year, DefiLlama data shows. Steep falls in Solana’s metrics came after the implosion of Terra network in May and a market-wide drop in July and after Bankman-Fried's FTX problems first came to light early last month.  Alternative currencies outside of the top 20 tokens by market capitalization saw slight changes as well, except for toncoin (TON), which fell 5% over the past 24 hours, and luna classic (LUNC), which dropped 7%.  Meanwhile, premarket futures for the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 both inched 0.5% higher, pointing to possible gains when the U.S. markets open on Thursday.

I have been a business builder, an entrepreneur, with Product & Business Management for over 20 years now; and a blockchain investor since the very beginning of this industry. I am from those who have seen Ethereum valuing 5 USD. The conviction that the world can be improved and seeing the reality from different angles helped me tap into different emergent industries – at that moment – with the purpose to take the innovative side and create valid business models that would generate value and change perceptions. Gold Fever started off in 2020, amidst the Covid lockdown. It was a bootstrap project in the beginning, like most of the projects I started, building up on the idea reiterated by CZ Changpeng Zhao, head of Binance, saying, back in 2019, that “Gaming will be an early adopter of blockchain technologies.” Inspired by the Gold Rush and how gold digging impacts the economy of a region, I developed the MVP using my own resources and pitched it to investors along with the idea that an MMORPG on the blockchain would bring in the best of the two worlds, would remain a fun game, but also a relevant platform for savvy traders. Two years later, I look at the genesys moment with a wiser and grateful eye – the complexity of an MMORPG in terms of gameplay influenced the way we envisioned the game economy and the way we approached the go-to-market: first, allow settlers to buy the game assets and allow them to learn the economy, then invite passionate players. Of course, everyone is welcome at any time. In between, there were a lot of hurdles given to the complexity of the game and the complexity of our smart contracts. We opened our kitchen for our early adopters so that they know the exact status of the development, we have a team of loyal players that have been with us from day 1 and helped with constant feedback and playing, we are now in beta and planning to launch end of Q2/Q3 2023 the mainnet website version. NewsBTC: Tell us more about GoldFever. How is it different from other P2E games? Emilian: GoldFever is different from several points of view. Gameplay based on realism and on skills, with a free-to-play The gameplay is based on realism and it mimics real life, which opens the gate for a more refined and maybe mature approach. The graphics are beautiful – it’s a dark-themed game built on Unreal 5.1, with action happening in the rainforest. Some parts are so real you can’t tell what is what. Game-Yiled-Generator (GYG) NFTs – created thanks to Ownership and decentralization. We decided to go that extra mile that was on everyone’s lips. Rethinking ownership and actually doing it on blockchain allowed us to go beyond the P2E model, a revolution in itself. We decentralized the game – really decentralized – took the main game assets and changed their ownership. Give them to the players. Lands, buildings, transportation, shops or any type of commercial buildings. We turned these vital assets for the game into NFTs. Soon, we realized they will produce yield only if players would interact socially. So, considering the importance of social interaction for the economy, we created the GYG NFTs – as they are digital assets that can produce in-game yield. The purpose of the decentralized ownership system is to generate a stable in-game economy and rely on a balance between “makers” and “takers” to keep things flowing. Such an economy needs a roughly equal mix of players who invest time and effort into generating assets to sell and players who want to spend real money to buy the product of that work as a shortcut to in-game success or status. The term we coined for Gold Fever is the Game-Yield-Generator model. So, in this challenging Gold Rush, you can not only grind for gold and earn, stake, lend or lease items, but also – and this is the GYG, the novel part – you would interact with each other to develop and trade the items you need within the game. You can work smart as an entrepreneur: either employ people that will help you increase your revenues or just set some fixed prices and let your NFTs, like buildings or planes, produce. Therefore, Gold Fever opted-in for decentralization – selling the GYGs to players, meaning all game assets and infrastructure – will stabilize the economy and create the base for the “makers”. The next step, being to “invite” the “takers” – the passionate players to actually play an attractive and juicy game, with a stable infrastructure. Really cool graphics I believe we are among the few – if not the only, MMORPG PvP survival blockchain game based on realism. And you can tell just by looking at it, it has cool graphics. NewsBTC: Please provide an insight into the GoldFever tokenomics and in-game economy. Emilian: If there is one single thing you should know about the in-game economy is the fact that Gold Fever is evolving the play2earn economy. How? By giving full ownership to the players – vital in-game assets like boats, planes, merchant shops, buildings, lands, mining claims, blueprints – are turned into NFTs. We will sell them to our community or to any savvy trader as they are very important for the game to actually happen, but, the more popular the game becomes, the more valuable the NFTs become – for the players, for the crypto traders, for the free market. Another important detail is the fact that we created new use cases for the NFT technology. The investment logic behind this is quite obvious if you are a gamer, less likely to be grasped if you are a crypto investor. You see, gamers are well aware of how much money they spend in-game to buy the skins, the weapons, the transportation or the food their character needs to survive. At a certain moment, they all considered how it would feel if they received a share of that money. Survival games are supposed to allow players to survive inside the game without having to spend money, right? If you want to eat Coconuts all day long, we won't stop you, but don't expect your characters to be strong in battle. Eat a good breakfast from the Bar! pic.twitter.com/yg63PtF1qu — Gold Fever (@GoldFeverGame) December 2, 2022 All we did was to turn the assets that, in-game, produce this sort of items into NFTs. Basically, when you buy it, it brings along several “perks” thanks to the ownership – you own it, you set the prices for the items it produces, you put it to work by investigating the in-game offer-demand. So, apart from the default set-up and the NFT – very much similar to yield farming – you have the possibility, if you choose to get involved and put in some effort, to multiply the basic revenue this NFT can produce you. A small example of how this works. Do you know the stores from Diablo Immortal? You went there and bought things because you needed them to play better. The money went to the game developers. Well, in Gold Fever, the item store is an NFT you can own and turn into a profitable business. It produces a fixed number of items and services daily that could be increased by hiring other players to do tasks such as bringing wood, hunting, transportation from building to building, or special quests. YOU, as a business owner, YOU set the price and you decide what service your building offers, you decide the prices or the items your building is selling. An example: you decide the price, but for the sake of simplicity let’s consider 1 USD price per item/service. Say…you sell 5 different items per day at 1USD/item with a minimal stock of 5 pieces from each and 30 people need your services – parking, hotel sleeping, sharpening, repairing etc and you charge 1USD/service. This means an income of: 25USD/day – 750USD/month from items; 30USD/day – 900USD/month if one person needs only one service 55USD/day – 1650USD/month in total NewsBTC: Walk us through the gameplay Emilian: Gold Fever is a free-to-play multiplayer strategy game. It hosts an enormous playable area that is covered by dense and dangerous jungles, tall mountains and, rivers filled with gold. The action takes place in a generic Oceania island, at the beginning of the 20th century, around 1930. The world is still reeling from its previous global conflict. Maps have been redrawn, riches have been reallocated and colonies have changed hands. And after all of that, there is still so much to explore. Far across the oceans, there is an island that hides a dangerous secret. Rumors speak of an untapped source of gold and precious minerals. This has lured various brave Adventurers to the Island to try their luck at seizing fame and fortune. As if battling hunger, fatigue, the elements, and the hostile fauna of the Island wasn’t enough, the Tribal natives relentlessly defend their homes and holy golden remnants of their ancestral gods. The danger is ever-present on the island whether battling human enemies or being hunted by predators. Surrounded by the never-ending ocean, no one can escape the siren call of the Gold Fever. Players can craft tools for survival and combat, forage for plants and herbs, and compete with other players for dominance in the search for gold. You can play the game as an adventurer seeking gold or as a tribal defending the native gold. Being a survival game, the confrontation is thrilling, dangerous, and full of surprises, but it leads to a most-wanted reward – the golden nuggets in the form of an in-game currency called NGL. NewsBTC: What are the different monetization opportunities available for a regular user within the GoldFever ecosystem? Emilian: Gold Fever has several angles when it comes to monetization. Since it is built on a P2E economy, you can make money from the P2E strategies such as grind for gold, speculate NGL, flip our NFTs, participate in quests and tasks coming from the people who own the in-game assets and are developing the in-game economy. Another monetization opportunity comes from owning NFTs, of course. We called the GYG NFTs – game yield generator NFTs – meaning, as I described above, that, if you own such an NFT and you get involved in the game economy by following closely the offer-demand ratio, you can become a very wealthy business owner. Otherwise, the GYG NFTs can provide you with a basic income based on the default items they produce and are sold depending on the number of players. Another monetization opportunity is trading via our exchange – you can stake-burn, buy-sell, borrow-lend, offer collateral. Renting NFTs out for a limited period of time to other players or employing the NFTs to perform specific automated tasks for an appropriate fee is another way to earn money in Gold Fever. A fourth monetization opportunity is our affiliate program – which has a unique trait – you get to win constantly from all the purchase actions the person you bring in is making – you win from onboarding a new user, from the NFTs that user is buying acquisition, from the in-game taxes that user is generating or from all the taxes generated by that user when using the website exchange. NewsBTC: Would you like to share some information about your team at GoldFever? Emilian: Currently the team has 55 experts, it’s an international team, with a gaming background, as follows: 11 Game Developers Unreal Engine C+++ 6 Backend & Blockchain Developers 14 Artists 3D & Concept Artwork 4 Technical Artists 3 Environmental Artists 1 Animator 4 Sound Designers 5 Game Designers 5 Marketing Specialists NewsBTC: The P2E gaming segment is gradually becoming a heavily contested space, with lots of new projects entering the market. How do you intend to keep up or overtake your competition? Emilian: I’m happy to say that, from what I’ve seen, there is actually no competition in our niche. There is no Survival-RPG realistic PVP video game out there and I’m afraid they won’t come anytime soon. There are other games out there, some interesting, some pure crap, but there are enough players for everyone. The truth is that we are looking forward to some competition that could actually help us learn something, but until serious studios decide to adventure in this realm, we will have no competition. Making an MMO takes 3-5 years and millions of dollars and that’s if you have experience. Doing a crypto MMO will take even more. Personally, I like what Star Atlas is trying to do because I like Eve Online and Star Citizen, but also because we, as a studio, are planning to add two more games connected to Gold Fever. One would be a contemporary GTA-like game and one would be a Space Conquering game. Your character would start in Gold Fever and your great-grandchildren will inherit your genes and wealth in these 2 games NewsBTC: We are curious to know about GoldFever’s investors, partnerships and collaborations, if any. Would you like to shine some light on it? Emilian: Of course. Gold Fever was vetted early on by the DAO Maker which incubated us. I would add here Huobi, Matrix Capital and LD Capital, along with somewhere around 200 KOls and influencers which put their faith in us and became initial token holders. NewsBTC: How does one get started on GoldFever? Emilian: It’s very simple. Right now, if you have a mask NFT attached to your character. You get the character for free, while onboarding. You get the mask from OpenSea, mid-January. Otherwise, once we go to the mainnet, you will have to create an account on our website and you will instantly get the wallet and the free character and you can start playing the game. NewsBTC: What is in store for GoldFever, and the gaming community at large in the coming days? Emilian: As stages of development, after setting the game core loop – the gold grinding, we will start, from Q1 2023 the decentralization and sell all the NFT infrastructure to settlers/entrepreneurs willing to develop the economy. Around mid-January we are planning our first NFT sale – the Genesys Masks – which will be available on NFT marketplace OpenSea. It unlocks a premium beta of the game that will go live from the end of January up until the end of June. The premium beta has installed for the players prizes up to 1 million USD in NGL and NFTs. Players won’t be able to access the mainnet until Q3 without a mask, a very special NFT that gives you super perks and bonuses.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://newsbtc.com/interview/interview-ceo-emilian-ciocanea-on-goldfever-how-it-blends-realism-skills-for-fresh-p2e-experience/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

On-chain data cited by crypto research firm Arkham Intelligence suggested $1.7 million worth of tokens from Alameda-linked wallets was sold in the open market over a span of several hours on Wednesday. That sparked concerns on Crypto Twitter that the sales would trigger a steep fall in the prices of those tokens.  Bankman-Fried denied being the source of the sales in a tweet on Friday afternoon, saying ""I'm not and couldn't be moving any of those funds; I don't have access to them anymore.""  On-chain data showed Ethereum-based tokens such as USD coin (USDC), dai (DAI), curve (CRV), ether (ETH), convex (CVX) and others were consolidated from several wallets to just two wallets and later sold for tether (USDT) stablecoin.  The value of the transactions ranged from a fraction of an ether to over 15 ether, the on-chain data shows. The holdings were then converted into bitcoin (BTC) using swapping services like FixedFloat and ChangeNow, on-chain sleuth ZachXBT noted in a tweet.  According to Arkham Intelligence data, Alameda still holds over $112 million worth of various cryptocurrencies, down from $140 million held in mid-November, as CoinDesk previously reported.  FTX filed for bankruptcy in November after revelations that Alameda, a hedge fund that Bankman-Fried also owned, was largely backed by FTT tokens, digital assets that FTX created out of thin air.

The price is trading below $16,700 and the 100 hourly simple moving average.

The pair could drop further if there is a clear move below the $16,500 support zone. Bitcoin Price Extends Losses Bitcoin price failed to gain pace above the $17,000 resistance zone. BTC started a fresh decline below the $16,800 support zone to move into a bearish zone. The price even traded below the $16,650 support zone and the 100 hourly simple moving average. It traded as low as $16,453 and is currently consolidating losses. The price is clearly trading in a bearish zone below $16,700 and the 100 hourly simple moving average.

On higher timeframes, the cryptocurrency records similar losses. Across the crypto market, red is the predominant color as significant assets follow BTC into the downside. Bitcoin Price Bound For A Spike In Volatility The decline in trading volume due to the holiday season has led the Bitcoin price to move sideways. This status quo is poised to change in early January when market participants return to active trading. However, the bulls might have issues pushing the price beyond local resistance at around $17,500 and $19,200, two levels that used to operate as critical support. Historically, the first month of the year is among the worst performers. Since 2013, the Bitcoin price has traded in the red for 60% of its monthly performance during January. According to a pseudonym analyst, this period has ended in adverse price action for the benchmark cryptocurrency. In addition to negative performance, the Bitcoin price often experiences sudden changes in its value. During this month, the cryptocurrency sees a spike in volatility which historically favors the selling side. The analyst said while sharing the chart below: We can also see how the percentage change on average in January is quite major. Both up and down. Will January bring some volatility back into the market? (…). Keep in mind that this data is not a reliable indicator for future returns. Use in confluence. After The Storm, Will Bitcoin Bounce? On a positive note, February is one of Bitcoin’s best-performing assets. Last year, the Bitcoin price ascended from a new all-time high of around $30,000 to $60,000. As seen in the chart above, February brought double-digit gains for BTC since 2021. Thus, while BTC might see a negative first month in 2023, February and March might become more favorable. This possible future performance coincides with some positive developments in the macroeconomic landscape, including a decrease in inflation and a short-term cap in interest rates hike from the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed). However, these conditions could apply for a limited time. NewsBTC reported that the traditional market would determine much of what happens with the Bitcoin price and the crypto market.

42388303,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRDWlJ,1672272070,First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Retreats Further Into the Gloom,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin, ether and most other major cryptocurrencies spent Wednesday in the red.  Insights: In this last week of 2022, First Mover Asia isrevisiting a few of CoinDesk's most noteworthy columns. In his latest Crypto Long and Short newsletter, CoinDesk research analyst George Kaloudis considered five of the most annoying events and trends in 2022. Unsurprisingly, topping his list, Kaloudis wrote of his anger at FTX.  Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 778.08 −14.8 ▼ 1.9% Bitcoin (BTC) $16,539 −164.2 ▼ 1.0% Ethereum (ETH) $1,189 −22.3 ▼ 1.8% S&P 500 daily close  3,783.22 −46.0 ▼ 1.2% Gold  $1,812 −2.8 ▼ 0.2% Treasury Yield 10 Years  3.89% ▲ 0.0 BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices; gold is COMEX spot price. Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Another Gloomy Day for Bitcoin  By James Rubin  Bitcoin added another dollop of gloom to an already gloomy year on Wednesday.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently down a percentage point over the past 24 hours to about $16,500. BTC has been clinging closer to $17,000 since mid-December amid market concerns about the latest macroeconomic uncertainties and the increased likelihood of Federal Reserve continuing to raise interest rates.  In an interview with CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program, Brent Xu, founder and CEO of cross-chain DeFi (decentralized-finance) hub Umee, said that markets seem to be destined to continue their declines well into 2023. ""Markets are going to bottom out around Q2 to Q3,"" Xu said. ""We're going to see another six to 12 months of negative sentiment, possibly 18 months.""  Still, he added that he expects ""better developments"" in the long term.  Ether was recently changing hands at just under $1,200 for a second consecutive day, off more than 2% from the day before. Other major cryptos were largely in the red amid tepid trading that is typical for most assets as a year closes. SOL, the token of the Solana blockchain, and APT, the native cryptocurrency of the Aptos blockchain system were down more than 11% and 10%, respectively. The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, recently fell 1.86%.  U.S. equity indexes slipped slightly as investors chewed over the implications of China reopening its borders after months of Covid-related lockdowns. The tech-focused Nasdaq and S&P 500, which has a hefty technology component, declined 1.4% and 1.2%, respectively. Stocks usually trade sideways at this time of the year, although a massive sell-off of Tesla's (TSLA) stock this month and Southwest Airlines' (LUV) mass cancellations may alter this traditional course.  For at least one day, a couple of faintly positive stories replaced the latest developments in crypto exchange FTX's crisis among industry headlines. Bitcoin miner Argo Blockchain (ARBK) avoided filing for bankruptcy protection after agreeing to sell its Dickens Country, Texas mining facility to Galaxy Digital for $65 million and securing a $35 million loan from the crypto-focused financial-services firm.  Earlier in the day (Hong Kong time), CoinDesk also reported that MicroStrategy (MSTR), the business software vendor that was co-founded by crypto proponent Michael Saylor, has added to its bitcoin stockpile, purchasing about 2,395 bitcoins for $42.8 million between Nov. 1 and Dec. 21 through its MacroStrategy subsidiary  Umee's Xu said that the recent uptick in macroeconomic conditions and crypto price stability has been troublesome for options trading. ""If you're an options trader, not a lot of volatility,"" Xu said. ""Whenever there's any price movements, they're not going to be sustained long enough form some notable trend.  ""It's just not the best time for investing in crypto assets,"" he added.  Biggest Gainers  There are no gainers in CoinDesk 20 today.

There were far more than five, but obvious things like “the market went down” are not included because they’re not fun to write about.

The FTX/Alameda/SBF fraud  This is probably the umpteen-millionth time you have read some version of a crypto person being mad about this, but I’m still mad at FTX (for the fraud), the reckless risk-takers (for the flexing) and many Twitter-ers (for the hero worship). I think the fraud speaks for itself. The embezzlement (or whatever it was) at FTX hurt real people. Rubbing salt in the wound: I got to ask FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried some questions, months before his exchange collapsed, on a CoinDesk TV program, but I failed to touch on anything hard-hitting. We talked about the Super Bowl mostly.  Watch: New FTX Boss Condemns Management of the Crypto Exchange During Sam Bankman-Fried's Tenure  2. Crypto hedge fund founders flexing  My brain is raising at least two pitchforks for the folks at crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC). It’s one thing to be a little annoyed with highly leveraged hedge funds (like 3AC) doing risky things in general; it’s another to be annoyed at the associated flexing (i.e., “showing off”) that took place on social media and elsewhere as highly leveraged hedge funds raked in the cash the last few years.  But it was revealed during liquidation proceedings that 3AC co-founders Kyle Davies and Su Zhu paid for a $50 million superyacht with company funds all while flexing that “100K ETH is dust.” Calling 100,000 ether “dust” was calling $400 million “not a lot of money.” 3AC collapsed. Also, the superyacht was named: “Much Wow.”  Yeah, I know.  Much cringe.
