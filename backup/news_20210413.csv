42434212,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP9KDh,1618355282,SEC's Peirce Updates Safe Harbor Proposal for Token Sales,"Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Commissioner Hester Peirce has an updated version of her proposal to let crypto startups sell tokens as initial coin offerings (ICOs) to fund their development efforts without running afoul of U.S. securities laws.      The Token Safe Harbor Proposal 2.0, published Tuesday, updates Peirce’s 2020 proposal, which suggested a three-year grace period that would let blockchain projects actually develop their networks or tokens after raising funds. Under the proposal, a company could sell tokens before building the project but would be exempt from federal requirements that securities issuers register with the SEC.      Tuesday’s version would require companies to provide updates to the SEC every six months and find outside counsel to explain whether their network could be considered “decentralized” at the end of the grace period.      “The safe harbor seeks to provide network developers with a three-year grace period within which, under certain conditions, they can facilitate participation in and the development of a functional or decentralized network, exempted from the registration provisions of the federal securities laws,” the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) official said in a public statement introducing the proposal.      If within three years the network was live and met a set of criteria for decentralization, the company would not have to register the tokens as securities or seek an exemption.      Andrew Hinkes, an attorney with Carlton Fields, tweeted the most significant changes include the new “mandatory semi-annual updates” to the development disclosure plan, the requirement that a block explorer be linked in the company’s disclosure and the outside counsel’s reporting requirement and guidance on what that external report should address.      According to the guidance, network decentralization and functionality are treated as two different issues. Decentralization is assessed by voting power, development efforts and network participation, while functionality is assessed by the ability to transmit or store value on the network, as well as run an application on it.      Projects that aren’t decentralized within the grace period must still register as securities issuers, according to the guidance.      “It appears that trading platforms that allow trading of tokens issued under this proposed rule would not be required to be national securities exchanges or alternative trading systems provided that they stop trading the tokens within six months of the issuer's counsel's determination that the network did not reach maturity as provided under the rule,” Hinkes told CoinDesk.      The new proposal omitted a “good faith” provision, alongside a provision that discussed the issuer’s role in facilitating secondary liquidity.      Kristin Smith, the executive director of the Blockchain Association, said the organization “applauds the work of Commissioner Peirce” in addressing the policy issue.      “Her willingness to think thoughtfully about these problems is something to be admired, and we are hopeful that she will be able to work constructively on this proposal with the incoming chairman,” Smith said.      Peirce published her proposal as the Senate voted to close debate on former CFTC Chair Gary Gensler’s nomination to lead the SEC (though Coinbase’s upcoming listing may be the more widely anticipated event this week). The Senate will vote to confirm Gensler on Wednesday.

42434170,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP9Jxh,1618353860,Bitcoin Analysts Set Sights on $70K (Even $80K) After All-Time High,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) break to an all-time high above $63,000 has several analysts feeling bullish, with price targets at $70,000 or higher by next month.      Risks remain as some analysts choose to wait for confirmation of the breakout in price charts, especially with bullish positioning reaches extreme levels in the futures market.      CoinDesk rounded up several cryptocurrency analysts for their bitcoin forecasts.      Alex Blum, managing director at Two Prime:    “After several weeks of healthy consolidation below $60,000, bitcoin has continued to align with stock-to-flow model projections.”  Blum also noted that heavy options buying behavior suggests the $72,00 price mark is a good estimate for end-of-month price targets.    Joe DiPasquale, CEO of BitBull Capital:    “Each time bitcoin tested a lower value, the price went back above $60,000. Now that it has broken out past the resistance at $652,000, I expect it to reach $70,000 by end of May.”    Garrick Hileman, head of research at Blockchain.com:    “The visibility brought to Coinbase direct public market listing on Wednesday and its strong financial performance is also helping to drive new all-time crypto highs.”  “We see significant upside from these levels.”    Justin Chuh, trader at Wave Financial, a digital asset management firm:    “As we enter unchartered territory, I continue to look at calendar and perpetual futures as price discovery tools. It feels like spot is getting dragged and yanked around by futures traders.”  previous strong resistance has turned into weak support at $61,000, according to Chuh.  “We have not added risk at or around these levels and are still determining if and how much to reduce.”    Matt Blom, head of sales and trading at Equos:    ""If Bitcoin carries on trading within its trend channel, then May's all-time high has the potential to register north of $80,000.""  ""Bitcoin dances to its own drum. A push up to $70,000 will very likely be met with another 'bitcoin just crashed 20%' moment that draws Peter Schiff out from his gold-plated coffin. Until then, it would appear that things are about to heat up.""  ""If profit-takers and bears (are they a thing anymore?) fail to take bitcoin back down below $61,700, then we will be free to focus on price discovery on the upside. $65,000 is the first hurdle, and then it's all-eyes on the next big target: $70,000.""  ""On the downside, a move down through support at $61,700 will dampen the mood. $58,820 will cap off any downside action as the market will look to cement that level as the lower bound of any future trading range.""    Edward Moya, senior market analyst, Oanda:    ""Bitcoin mania is running wild as the Coinbase [initial public offering] is generating a new wave of retail and institutional excitement. The question on everyone’s mind is will Wednesday start of trade for Coinbase trigger a selling event. Some brokers will allow leveraged trading of the Coinbase IPO but there will probably be limited ability to short.""

42434173,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP9K1h,1618346681,The Node: Balaji's Blueprint for India,"With Coinbase going public this week, crypto passes an important milestone. The $100 billion-plus listing validates the industry on Wall Street and could catalyze a new wave of crypto startup funding.      But, even now, we’re only at the very beginning of what this tech can do. We’re passing through the validation stage to the point where things get really interesting. We’re about to see what happens when millions of people start using radically new forms of money, with all the economic consequences that flow from that.      For a taste of what could happen next, it’s worth reading Balaji S. Srinivasan. A former Coinbase CTO and board partner at VC firm Andreessen Horowitz, Srinivasan is a genuine big-thinker with a history of making ahead-of-the-curve predictions.    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    Srinivasan recently wrote about how India could adopt a digital rupee and a series of “national software stacks and neutral crypto protocols,” helping its entrepreneurs to get funding and leapfrogging a less-than-modern economy into the future. His mercifully clear “Add Crypto to IndiaStack” essay should be required reading for policymakers trying to work out what the crypto fuss is about.      The existing IndiaStack is a robust set of APIs for mobile payments (UPI), identity (Aadhaar), KYC (eKYC) and much else. Srinivasan proposes that India add a digital rupee and wallet to this, allowing citizens to move money between mobile phones without going through banks.      After that, he suggests, the wallet can be enabled to accept other select forms of crypto, allowing entrepreneurs to access pools of overseas capital, including the billions already moving around decentralized finance (DeFi). This can help address India’a SME “funding gap,” which is estimated at $250-500 billion.    Read more: India’s Millennials Embrace Digital Gold Despite Proposed Bitcoin Ban    “By adding both a digital rupee and crypto support to IndiaStack, we could turn every phone into not just a bank account but a bonafide Bloomberg Terminal, giving every Indian the ability to make both domestic and international transactions of arbitrary complexity, attracting crypto capital from around the world, and leapfrogging the 20th century financial system entirely,” Srinivasan writes.      DeFi replaces a world of paper contracts and law enforcement with smart contracts and on-chain transactions that take out the middlemen in lending and credit. “The ability to write programs with money is as big a breakthrough as the ability to write programs with documents. It gives Wall Street's capabilities to anyone – including the average Indian – without expensive lawyers or financiers,” he writes.      Indian officials have shown a disdain for crypto trading up to now, even threatening to ban it recently. But Indians have shown a lot of interest in bitcoin. Srinivasan shows how the underlying tech might become acceptable: i.e. within a government-organized program.      The involvement of any state bodies in the emerging crypto-economy will be an anathema to some. But governments won’t want to be left out, especially as China (India’s great rival) develops its own powerful crypto stack, including a digital currency and a blockchain-based services network.      Srinivasan sees IndiaStack as a way to escape the control of the legacy American-run financial system and the emerging Chinese-blockchain nexus. India can put itself at the forefront of a new “non-aligned” movement (what he calls the ""Decentralized Movement""). Instead of swapping American surveillance for Chinese surveillance, he argues countries can align themselves with the ethos of Bitcoin and Ethereum “that all of them benefit from but none of them control.”      Today, Coinbase.

42434188,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP9KTh,1618345912,Why Binance Coin Hit All-Time High (and $86B Valuation) Ahead of Coinbase Listing,"Why wait for the Coinbase listing of its shares on the Nasdaq? There’s already a way – in cryptocurrency markets – to bet on the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange.      It’s a digital token linked to the success of Binance, which boasts a higher spot trading volume than Coinbase, according to the data site CoinGecko. The token, binance coin (BNB), has surged 14-fold in price this year, for a market value of $86 billion.      Some cryptocurrency investors see BNB as a way to get excess return over a simple purchase of bitcoin, whose doubling in price this year looks almost paltry by comparison, Joshua Frank, co-founder and CEO of crypto data firm The TIE, told CoinDesk in an interview.      “Funds can’t just buy bitcoin, because if the funds just buy bitcoin it’s not worth it for their investors,” Frank said. Binance coin “is one of those larger coins that they can get exposure to, and they can put a large position in.”      Binance press officials said they didn’t know why BNB has rallied so dramatically this year. The token's price “is not something that can be controlled,” according to a spokesperson.      But cryptocurrency analysts said Binance’s recent business moves, including launching a blockchain network to compete with Ethereum for a share of the decentralized finance market, known as DeFi, have helped to boost the BNB token’s prospects.      Unlike Coinbase’s soon-to-be-issued shares, BNB tokens confer no equity ownership rights. Binance is a closely-held firm, still led by its founder, Changpeng Zhao, often referred to by his initials, CZ.      Instead, BNB is considered an “exchange token.” It can be used to pay fees on various Binance trading platforms, sometimes entitling the payers to discounts, or even as a currency on blockchain networks sponsored by the exchange. Investors in the token are essentially betting on its supply and demand, which effectively translates to a bet on the success of the Binance ecosystem.    The rise of Binance Smart Chain    Binance Smart Chain (BSC), a less decentralized public blockchain that’s considered a competitor with the Ethereum blockchain, has been quite successful. With transaction fees that are about 35 times cheaper, BSC has overtaken Ethereum in the first three months of 2021 for daily unique active wallets, according to DappRadar’s 2021 Q1 overview report on April 1.      In March, the total value locked in Venus, the top decentralized money-market protocol on BSC, surpassed that of some of the most popular DeFi projects on Ethereum, including Uniswap and Compound, DappRadar wrote in its report, citing data from Defistation.      The huge success of Binance Smart Chain has played a significant role in BNB’s rapid growing value. As a “discount token,” BNB offers discounts for trading on both Binance’s decentralized exchange (Binance DEX) and Binance, according to Nick Mancini, research analyst at Trade The Chain.      The TIE’s Frank told CoinDesk that many crypto-native hedge funds have recognized BSC as a “much cheaper and more effective way” to access DeFi than stomaching Ethereum’s transaction fees, known as “gas,” where rates have soared due to network congestion.      BNB is used as gas to pay for DeFi deployment to BSC.      Mancini speculated that BNB’s market capitalization might eventually overtake that of ether, the Ethereum blockchain network’s native cryptocurrency. Ether prices have tripled this year, to a market value just over $260 billion.      “If BNB and ether continue to grow at the same rate, BNB will flip ether within the next two to four months,” Mancini said.    Alt season    It can’t be overstated that BNB’s price surge has come during “alt season” – a stretch of time where crypto traders have bid up so-called altcoins, ostensibly due to a lull in bitcoin’s rally.      This is evidenced by recent drop in bitcoin’s share of all cryptocurrencies’ value, known as the market dominance ratio, to a two-year low.      Crypto hedge funds trying to beat the market may also have been forced to invest in altcoins like BNB.      Fund managers typically impose a “2 and 20” annual fee structure, meaning a 2% management fee of a fund’s net asset value and a 20% performance fee. Since there are so many ways for investors to hold bitcoin at low cost, crypto hedge funds have to come up with “unique ways” of beating the largest cryptocurrency’s returns for less costly fees, Frank said.      “Funds can’t just buy bitcoin because if the funds just buy bitcoin, it’s not worth it for their investors,” Frank said. “Funds have to go out and deploy so much capital, and binance coin is one of those larger coins that they can get exposure to and they can put a large position in.”    Coinbase direct listing’s spillover    The Coinbase stock listing might be another potential driver of BNB’s gains.      While Binance’s CZ has told CoinDesk that the company does not plan to go public, the token ecosystem might be benefiting from speculation over Coinbase’s value.      A pre-listing tracking contract traded on the FTX exchange puts Coinbase’s share price at about $634, which would imply a market value for the U.S. exchange north of $160 billion.      As CoinDesk reported previously, exchange tokens have skyrocketed since last year, sometimes traded as a crypto-native proxy for equity in the companies behind the exchanges, arguably the industry’s top revenue-getters. Another exchange token, FTX’s own FTT, has posted year-to-date gains of more than 800%, per Messari data.      “By buying these exchange tokens, it may be a ‘buy the rumor, sell the news’ type of event, where things are going to run up so much in the next few days in anticipation” of the Coinbase listing, Frank said.    As rewards go up, risks also increase    Of course, with the extreme gains in BNB come major risks.      Paramount among those, in a cryptocurrency industry where decentralization is prized, is that Binance is so centralized: BNB is owned and created by Binance, and the Binance team still owns over 80% of BNB, according to Mancini.      It means that “there is a centralized authority to answer if regulators came knocking,” Mancini said. Contrast that with ether, which is fully open-source. “This regulatory risk can create a serious hurdle for BNB being listed on other exchanges, or being allowed to grow its utility on American or European soil.”      Ryan Watkins, a research analyst at Messari, also criticized BSC’s centralization in a recent tweet thread, arguing that BSC is just a “copycat” of Ethereum.      “The reason why BSC is faster and more scalable is not because of some magical technological innovation,” Watkins wrote. “It’s instead the magic of centralization. BSC is an Ethereum fork with a centralized validator set. That’s it, nothing more.”      However, hedge funds or even average crypto investors might not care about that too much, at least in the short term, The TIE’s Frank said.      “The average consumer just wants a good user experience,” Frank said. Meanwhile, “if you are a hedge fund that’s trading and taking small-term positions or small-term bets, you also care a lot less about decentralization risks.”      BNB’s low-price strategy also might eventually lose its competitive allure.      “Eventually everyone reaches 0% fees on trades,” Mancini said. “Although BNB offers cheaper trading right now, eventually that benefit will go away.”",POSITIVE,BNB,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/13/why-binance-coin-hit-all-time-high-and-86b-valuation-ahead-of-coinbase-listing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a0106ebccd8e4e5fca81fe9e9ad6cdfa633123ee-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Climbing 4.84% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $59,758.21-$63,707.34 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC trades above its 10-hour and 50-hour averages on the hourly chart, a bullish signal for market technicians.    Coinbase’s widely anticipated direct stock listing on Nasdaq continues to galvanize crypto-market interest as bitcoin’s price broke Tuesday to a new record high.      At press time, the No. 1 cryptocurrency by market capitalization was changing hands at $62,860.01, not far from the all-time high price of $63,707.34 reached earlier in the day, according to CoinDesk 20.      Spot trading volume on eight crypto exchanges tracked by CoinDesk also rose on Tuesday, to near $4 billion at press time, the highest since April 7.      The bullish sentiment is reflected on the bitcoin’s futures market, with the annualized premium between the BTC futures price and spot price now approaching 50% for three-month contracts. It’s seen as an indication that more futures traders are looking for upside.      “Markets are positioning themselves for a direct listing that potentially values Coinbase at more than $100 billion,” Jason Lau, chief operating officer at San Francisco-based crypto exchange OKCoin, said. “As a result, demand for bitcoin and crypto has never been higher.”    Ether and altcoins  Ether (ETH) trading around $2,297.81 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET).

Seemingly in lockstep with bitcoin, ether rallied Tuesday to new record high prices.      But the star lately among altcoins might be BNB token, from the crypto exchange giant Binance.      While exchange tokens in general have received a boost from comparisons with Coinbase, BNB’s rapid value increase may also have something to do with the success of Binance Smart Chain, an Ethereum alternatives launched by Binance.      Total value locked on BSC now sits at around $30 billion, more than double over the last month, according to Arcane Research’s weekly newsletter Tuesday.      “If this growth rate continues, it will not take long until Binance-based projects hold more value than Ethereum-based projects,” Arcane wrote.

Here’s What That Means,"When trading in crypto exchange Coinbase’s shares goes live Wednesday under the ticker COIN, market makers are going to need a gauge for where they should start trading.      That gauge is known as the “reference price” and the one for COIN will be released at the close of the U.S. equities market today by the equity exchange Nasdaq. The price is normally found by Nasdaq consulting with the company’s financial advisers (in this case Goldman Sachs) and is often the price at which the company last traded on private markets ($343.58 per share in Coinbase’s case).      The reference price will affect how much money the 114,800 Class A shares the company is selling to new investors in the offering will add to the company’s treasury, said James Friedman, senior fintech research analyst at Susquehanna International Group.      Should COIN trade below the reference price during the first few days of trading it would likely be considered a black eye for the exchange from a PR perspective, but Friedman said most equity analysts will have their eyes on Coinbase’s long game.      “There’s a lot more to the creation of public equity than its first day of trading,” Friedman said. “Square stock went down to $8 not long after trading because they lost the Starbucks account … now they’re above $200.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/13/nasdaq-is-disclosing-coinbases-reference-price-this-afternoon-heres-what-that-means,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7eb74f911460b46110b19885a13ccfd4a2af2047-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434183,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP9KNh,1618340019,This VC Gave Coinbase Its First Check,"The early days of Coinbase are now the stuff of Silicon Valley legend.      Take for instance the moment when, fresh out of the famous Y Combinator accelerator, Coinbase co-founder Brian Armstrong showed the rapid increase in the price of a cryptocurrency called bitcoin to the head of Initialized Capital.      Back in early 2013, Initialized chief Garry Tan saw how this new Coinbase app was running out of working capital to handle demand for transactions by around 9 a.m. each morning. The enthusiastic VC agreed to wire $200,000 as a quick fix, and then went off to help raise some more cash. “I was their first check into their seed round at Demo Day,” Tan wrote late last year.      Today, the total assets on Coinbase’s platform stand at $223 billion, according to its recent earnings report, a dizzying 150% increase compared to the final quarter of 2020. The large numbers, buoyed by bitcoin’s price surge, are fueling a Wall Street debut on Wednesday that’s expected to value Coinbase at around $100 billion.      Whatever the valuation, Tan’s early involvement is about to be rewarded handsomely.    Pre-Coinbase    Tan recalls Armstrong’s product demo, when he sent the investor 0.01 BTC on the first iteration of Coinbase, called BitBank at that time.      “It was live and it worked. It just really stood out,” Tan told CoinDesk via email. “When I first heard about crypto on Y Combinator's Hacker News, I thought it was software eating money. When software eats anything, it's a big deal: Airbnb, Uber, etc. I thought it would be an alternative to Visa and international remittance, as a medium of exchange.”      Instead, as Coinbase put it in a report published in January, “Bitcoin’s primary application is as a store of wealth.” Some $122 billion of that aforementioned $223 billion on Coinbase is from institutions.      Tan had first come across Armstrong when he was still working at Airbnb. At the time, Armstrong was the number one customer of SiftScience, an anti-fraud startup that Tan had funded.      “I heard that the Sift founder Jason Tan and Brian Armstrong were up until 2 a.m. debugging a problem with the software. That's exactly what great engineers do. They're great at the craft,” said Tan.    VC victory lap    Garry Tan is part of a close-knit group of Silicon Valley investors who helped kickstart Coinbase, and continue to play a key role in the U.S. crypto industry as a whole.      As for Tan’s early Coinbase backing, Initialized co-founder Alexis Ohanian (of Reddit fame) also lent a hand.      “Alexis, [Y Combinator General Partner] Harjeet Taggar, and I all worked on the Coinbase deal, though I was the primary contact at YC and Initialized,” said Tan. “Alexis specifically helped promote Bitcoin and Coinbase and helped to introduce crypto to more press. I definitely helped him buy into the Ethereum presale, which was a powerful moment in crypto.”    Read more: Rap Icon Nas Could Net $100M When Coinbase Lists on Nasdaq    Helping startups scale is a team sport, and Tan acknowledges there are others who should be thanked. This includes a “serious hats off” to Union Square Venture as well as Andreessen Horowitz for seeing the hockey stick, continuing to buy more of the company, and injecting next-level leadership from Katie Haun and Chris Dixon, he said.      “Special mention goes to Micky Malka at Ribbit Capital for being critical for navigating the realm of regulations, bank relationships, and broad connections,” said Tan. “He's very humble but I know how much work he put in here and it was impressive to see.”      In hindsight, Tan says he underestimated bitcoin’s role as a durable store of value against a much larger macroeconomic shift: the massive expansion of the world’s money supply.      “Store of value is of real utility, and, I believe, durable as a super-trend,” said Tan. “We'll see more cycles of boom and bust, I remain bullish on cryptocurrency as a force for decentralization, which is brought ever more to the fore with the unprecedented amount of control big tech giants have over the lives of our citizenry.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/04/13/this-vc-gave-coinbase-its-first-check,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cb7bdbcb672e6e12b3b32f58a0d52977c1a7ac83-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434182,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP9KLh,1618339951,Coinbase Listing: The Journey From Y Combinator to Nasdaq,"It wasn’t always clear that Coinbase was going to be a profitable company in the long term.      The crypto exchange set to list on Nasdaq on Wednesday had to husband its resources during the industry’s prosperous times to make it through the lean periods.      “There have been a lot of moments in Coinbase’s past where the right person made the right call,” said Asiff Hirji, president of blockchain mortgage platform Figure and former Coinbase president and chief operating officer. “In the first crypto winter, they hung in there with their business model and saving enough cash to preserve through the winter. That’s an amazing call to make.”      Hirji recalled planning for 2018. ""We had done a billion dollars in revenue in 2017 and said that next year we were planning on doing $500 million in revenue. [The board] was used to [feverlines moving] up and to the right and we told them ‘We are a highly volatile business.’ … We assumed that on Jan. 1, 2018, bitcoin would crash. We were only off by a quarter.”      Bitcoin’s future was just as uncertain as the company’s own in the early days.      “It was not clear that the cryptocurrency experiment would even work,” said Olaf Carlson-Wee, the first hire at Coinbase, now the CEO and founder of Polychain Capital. “Now we talk about market share in cryptocurrency or cryptocurrency competing with fintechs and things like that. At the time, this was much more existential and was about whether the entire category would work and most of those early Coinbase folks were true believers that had faith that this was an incredibly new technology.”      That belief now appears to be vindicated with Goldman Sachs advising Coinbase on the listing and the coveted COIN ticker secured.      Following is a timeline tracing Coinbase’s journey from the Y Combinator incubator, through those uncertain periods described by Hirji and Carlson-Wee, to its imminent multibillion-dollar stock market debut.    2012    Brian Armstrong leaves Airbnb to start Coinbase. (Former Goldman Sachs Trader Fred Ersham will join later as co-founder.) The company raises $600,000 in seed funding from Y Combinator and other investors.

On the other is everybody else, whether ardently dismissing bitcoin or merely sitting on the sidelines.      Let’s be honest, naysayers are having a tough go of it in 2021. Tired arguments equating bitcoin to tulip mania are obsolete, and even the most seasoned investment professionals who previously brushed off cryptocurrency are either getting involved or admitting they might have missed something. This is causing investment managers who simply don’t yet own bitcoin for clients, the sideline crowd, to feel extremely nervous right now. And it comes down to fiduciary duty.    Nik Bhatia is the author of ""Layered Money: From Gold and Dollars to Bitcoin and Central Bank Digital Currencies"" (2021). He is a CFA charter holder and adjunct professor of Finance and Business Economics at the University of Southern California Marshall School of Business.    A fiduciary is somebody who has a legal obligation to take care of money on behalf of clients. The only remaining defendable excuse for an investment manager not yet allocating to bitcoin is price volatility. A fiduciary including bitcoin in a portfolio would launch the range of expected returns excessively wider than what was originally promised. A small 5% position in bitcoin could be extremely fruitful in a year like 2021 but cause massive underperformance in a year like 2018. In this thinking, the fiduciary has a duty to exclude bitcoin because of the potential negative impact on investment returns.    Read more: Nik Bhatia - Why $1 Million Bitcoin Is Coming    But price volatility doesn’t necessarily equate to outright risk, and herein lies the complexity. Fiduciaries have a duty to exclude bitcoin from portfolios due to price volatility, but they are actually taking on an entirely separate risk hidden in plain sight: the failure to correctly identify monetary reality. The dollar might not cease to be the world’s most popular currency denomination in the near future, but the stampede of 100 million people converting at least part of their savings and their mental denomination to BTC is shaking the ground of every land mass on the planet.      Those earthquakes resonate with a belief in bitcoin as a consensus mechanism used to determine what is money, or what is real. Now, saying that a fiduciary’s job is to identify an existential shift in monetary reality sounds like a stretch. However, fiduciaries focused on growth should recognize an asset that completed a decade of 200% compound annual growth. And if they haven’t, chances are they’ve started to underperform their peers.      The underperformance should lead a diligent investor to ask questions about bitcoin and the technological and geopolitical shifts associated with an internet-based, non-government currency. What does your fiduciary duty require of you? Can you afford to be entirely without ownership of what a growing percentage of the world’s population consider an alternative, fully digital and stateless monetary regime? When looked at from that perspective, it might be your fiduciary duty to own bitcoin for your clients despite its price volatility.    The only remaining defendable excuse for an investment manager not yet allocating to bitcoin is price volatility.    Here’s the correct thesis for investment managers asking these important questions in 2021: it’s time to own some bitcoin for clients. The base assumption for fiduciaries can no longer be a dollar-only future. The monetary and cryptography sciences have officially merged, and bitcoin has already achieved global reserve currency status. Not owning bitcoin is now the unhedged position. And in an era of financial instability, an unhedged position is ripe for disaster.      Owning some bitcoin, even if in the smallest nominal amount, allows fiduciaries to demonstrate an understanding that the world’s denomination is slowly changing, not away from the dollar to the renminbi or euro, but away from a dependence on government-issued currencies. The change is subtle, especially with the global economy entirely reliant on the current monetary infrastructure. But those willing to read between the lines have already purchased bitcoin for their client whether they call it a hedge, speculative bet, or monetary revolution.      There’s one final component to the argument for fiduciaries to allocate to bitcoin, and that’s human freedom. In the West, it’s incredibly easy to ignore bitcoin’s potential as a tool for financial empowerment – bitcoin receives demand from those looking to make a political statement against the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank.    Read more: How 2,000 Years of Monetary History Led Us to Bitcoin, Feat. Nik Bhatia    But we live in a world with serious problems plaguing our planet, such as environmental destruction, human trafficking, and politically-caused inflation. Today, so many fiduciaries are not only responsible for investment performance but also for advancing corporate responsibility and positively influencing societal change – financial index publisher MSCI now provides ESG (environmental, social and governance) ratings for over 14,000 corporate issuers as sustainable investing is transforming the entire approach to investment management.      With bitcoin acting as an alternative in inflation-ravaged countries such as Venezuela, Argentina and Nigeria, it has the potential to alleviate human strife. Maybe after reading this article, fiduciaries might suppress their own fears of crypto-volatility to simultaneously pursue superior investment returns and social impact.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Nik Bhatia,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/13/asset-managers-owning-bitcoin-is-now-your-fiduciary-duty,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d7155e3c43dee5d04c921834c594e10149548ce8-1400x931.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434185,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP9KPh,1618333515,Coinbase 'IPO' Isn't an IPO. Here's Why That's Important,"The listing of Coinbase shares on Nasdaq this week is generating high expectations, as well as much debate as to whether the price will “pop” upon the market open.      Tech listings generally attract rapt attention, as even those not trying to invest find the initial trade movements compelling entertainment. With Coinbase’s listing, the attention will be especially acute, as the initial price movement will not just represent money being made or lost – it also could shape the digital asset industry narrative for some time to come.      One important feature of Coinbase’s listing is that it is not an initial public offering (IPO), although many media publications have mistakenly described it as such. Coinbase has chosen to come to market via a direct listing, a relatively new option for companies wishing to go public, and one that is curiously suited to a crypto company. But the differences between direct listings and IPOs are material and are causing some confusion in the market.      So, in the interests of clarifying what the direct listing choice means for Coinbase, here we look at the main differences and how they may affect the initial price movement as well as the company’s equity strategy going forward.    Noelle Acheson is CoinDesk's managing director of Research. For more insights, visit CoinDesk's Research Hub.    IPO shares get allocated at a pre-established price; direct listing shares do not. In an IPO, investment bankers set the share price as high as they think the market will bear because they usually get paid a percentage (typically as much as 7%) of the total amount raised. They base this figure on tentative expressions of interest from institutional investors.      In a direct listing, there is no pre-set price decided by a group of investment bankers – the market on the initial trading day influences the starting price. On the day of initial trading, there is a 10-minute “display only” period in which interested buyers enter their bids and sellers (Coinbase’s existing shareholders) enter their offers. Nasdaq uses this information to calculate the “current reference price.” Goldman Sachs (in consultation with Coinbase) then decides whether the listing goes ahead. If it decides yes, the applicable orders that have been entered will be executed at that price, and trading begins.      IPOs raise new capital, direct listings do not. This direct listing will not fill Coinbase’s coffers with cash, but it will make it easier for Coinbase to raise capital going forward. A direct listing is a liquidity event; an IPO is a capital-raising event.      In theory, IPOs are less volatile in initial trading than direct listings, for three reasons:    They do not count on the support of large institutions, which in an IPO would commit to buying a certain size tranche. These institutions would then have a face-saving and economic incentive to keep the price above their commitment level.  In an IPO, existing shareholders typically have a lock-up period of six to 12 months during which they cannot dump their shares on the market. A direct listing does not have a lock-up because it is based on shareholders selling their holdings. (There are exceptions, such as Palantir, which imposed its own lock-up that limited insiders to selling 20% of their holdings. The share price slumped the day the lock-up expired.)  The sellers of Coinbase shares in a direct listing (existing shareholders) do not have to sell their shares. Some may wait to see how trading is going before submitting their offers, which will affect the number of shares being traded and could exacerbate price swings. Coinbase has registered 114,850,769 shares eligible for sale, but we do not yet know how many shares will actually change hands Wednesday. It could be significantly less.    That said, Spotify and Slack did not show unexpected volatility on the first day of trading after their respective direct listings.      IPOs are cumbersome, involving expensive roadshow tours to present the company to institutional investors, and higher investment banking fees. Direct listings eschew the promotional costs and much of the consultancy fees by listing already issued shares owned by shareholders. The onerous cost of an IPO is one reason why companies are in general staying private for longer. A direct listing is a better option for a company that wishes to focus more on expanding a business than one interested in initial share prices.      What's more, because the market effectively sets the initial price rather than a group of investment bankers, it is more in line with crypto’s open-access and transparent ethos.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Noelle Acheson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/04/13/coinbase-ipo-isnt-an-ipo-heres-why-thats-important,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b1d33beeac9270ef7c4be8250f2212abfa013b63-1200x789.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The annualized premium between the BTC futures price and spot price is now approaching 50% on three-month contracts. This indicates extreme willingness of traders to obtain upside exposure in BTC futures, according to a new report by Arcane Research, a cryptocurrency research firm.    “The current premiums on the retail-focused exchanges are the highest we have registered,” according to Arcane.  The premium on the institutional-focused Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) is just above 10% annualized versus 50% for retail-focused exchanges such as FTX, BitMex and Deribit.  Arcane also noted the lack of liquidity on retail exchanges coupled with the demand for upside exposure as the main reason for the uptrend in futures premiums. The rise in premiums have accelerated since the March 25 price low in BTC around $50,000, which followed a near 19% sell-off.  It is possible that sellers have capitulated around that level, which encouraged extreme bullish positioning in the futures market ahead of the recent breakout to a new all-time high.    Funding rates have also skyrocketed in the perpetual swaps market for bitcoin, which indicates extreme upside leverage.      “Most perpetuals are currently trading at a significant premium to spot,” wrote Arcane. “Leverage is an essential ingredient in the recipe for liquidations, and we would not be surprised to see an influx in long liquidations soon.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Damanick Dantes,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/13/bitcoin-traders-seek-further-upside-exposure-pushing-futures-premiums-higher,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/54929dfed889348041951ebd6a9026f0de25ec9a-2048x1536.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406195,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAesiNp,1618329898,"DeFi Is Transparent, Unless You Look Closely","In a recent research paper published in the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Review, I argued that “DeFi [decentralized finance] has the potential to create a truly open, transparent and immutable financial infrastructure.”      The unprecedented speed of financial innovation in DeFi is exciting, and the space is home to some of the smartest people I know. But in the midst of this excitement, it is important not to forget about the risks.    Fabian Schär is a professor for distributed ledger technologies and fintech at the University of Basel and the managing director of the Center for Innovative Finance at the Faculty of Business and Economics, University of Basel.    When I say risk, I am not referring to the usual suspects, such as smart contract vulnerabilities or economic attack vectors. I am also not talking about centralization creep, admin keys, oracle dependencies or highly concentrated governance token holdings. All of the above are important aspects, may cause some havoc and certainly deserve our attention.      What I am mainly concerned with is an inherent risk, based on one of the fundamental properties of DeFi. I am talking about the dark side of composability, the vast differences in theoretical and actual transparency and the potential for the amplification of systemic shocks.      In theory, DeFi is highly transparent. The rules (smart contract code) and actions (transactions) are publicly available, and some additional meta-information (events) may help an observer to make sense of the data. This is a great advantage over the traditional financial system, where much of the data is scattered across various proprietary databases and, in many cases, not accessible or to be analyzed in any meaningful way.      I used to be quite optimistic that DeFi could improve on the status quo and have spent significant portions of my early DeFi talks elaborating on why the cryptographic transparency may shape the future of finance. Today, I am still excited and hopeful but less enthusiastic.      See also: Why DeFi Pulse’s Key Metric Is So Simple It’s Confusing      Theoretical transparency does not necessarily correspond to actual transparency. Just because the data is publicly available does not mean that people – or machines, for that matter – can make sense of it. In many cases, it is tough to find answers to seemingly straightforward questions and the risk of data getting misinterpreted is considerable.    Composability in the absence of actual transparency can have devastating consequences.    Let us start with a very simple example. Assume you want to know the current ownership distribution of a given DeFi token. You could easily request the current account balances from the corresponding ERC-20 token contract and use this data to compute ownership statistics.      However, simply looking at the account balances of an ERC-20 token contract would be highly problematic. In many cases, a large portion of the tokens is controlled by other protocols. If, for example, 1,000 tokens are locked in a staking protocol, we must find a way to proportionally assign these 1,000 tokens to the accounts that own a share of the staking pool. Some of the staking pool owners will likely be other protocols. Consequently we have to assign the tokens once again to the owners of that protocol, who may potentially be further protocols.      Each step increases the complexity, introduces additional dependencies and makes the token a little harder to analyze. We end up with schemes that create tokens, on top of tokens, on top of tokens. Once we include negative balances (short selling through lending markets), various sorts of financial derivatives, and realize that there is a potential for recursive effects, we get an understanding of how this seemingly straightforward analysis may pose severe challenges.      In a recent research paper I have written together with Matthias Nadler, we analyzed these adjustments, computed ownership tables for many of the most popular DeFi tokens, and introduced the term “wrapping complexity,” which measures the average number of adjustment – or “wrapping” – steps for a given base token. Whenever this token (or one of its wrapped variants) is locked in a protocol, the wrapping complexity increases.      Although the analysis is just a first step, we are confident that the wrapping complexity can provide valuable insights and be an additional puzzle piece to quantify and observe dependencies and risk aggregation. Moreover, it may give some context to TVL (total value locked), a number that still receives a lot of attention, despite the widespread view that it is somewhat problematic and must be interpreted with great care.      But token composability is just the tip of the iceberg or the peak of the “Misty Mountains of DeFi.” In addition to the vast areas that are covered in mist, there is an extensive yet largely unexplored system of caverns below the mountains. To really understand how everything is connected, one would have to look far beyond the transaction level, analyze internal calls and aggregate the dependencies in a macro model.      I am afraid that we have barely scratched the surface. Considering that the DeFi ecosystem is getting more complex and interconnected each day, our lack of knowledge may be problematic.      Let me be clear: Composability has great effects on financial innovation, and it is one of the defining properties of DeFi. So, I am in no way arguing against composability or openness. What I am saying is that composability in the absence of actual transparency can have devastating consequences.      You don’t have to look back too far to find examples of what can happen when complexity gets in the way of transparency – and I truly believe we should learn from what went wrong in traditional financial markets.      I am concerned that we are in the process of creating a system with a few systemically relevant protocols, some of which have severe external dependencies and are heavily centralized kill switches that may potentially be a threat to the entire DeFi ecosystem.      See also: Jesus Rodriguez – When DeFi Becomes Intelligent      It seems like the speed of financial innovation is much greater than what data analysts can possibly keep up with. This may be a general problem; however, in the DeFi space it is more pronounced. Composability essentially supercharges the effect and transparency is always lagging behind.      On the bright side: All the data is there. It is freely available for everyone to analyze, and there is an increasing number of individuals and organizations trying to make sense of it. So essentially, this is a call to action.      We need more researchers in the space. We need additional tools, better metrics, and we must get rid of our fixation on one-dimensional and potentially problematic numbers, such as TVL. This will help us to navigate the “Misty Mountains of DeFi” and fulfill the promise of a more robust and transparent financial infrastructure.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | RESEARCH,Fabian Schar,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/04/13/defi-is-transparent-unless-you-look-closely,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/faf59a42a42795055db031c6a306d983676c6076-2196x1154.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406201,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAesiQm,1618328816,The NFT Craze Is Helping Nigerian Artists Go Global,"In March, Oyindamola Oyekemi Oyewumi, a 24-year-old Nigerian artist who creates portraits using ballpoint pens, tweeted her drawing of Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson.      Hoskinson noticed the tweet and put it up for sale as a non-fungible token (NFT), or one-of-a-kind digital item with its own digital signature. By the end of the month, the tweet sold for $6,300 and now it’s Hoskinson’s Twitter profile picture.      “Luckily for me, Hoskinson himself told me about NFTs. He gave me a link to read about NFTs and, after reading about it, I decided I want to try it out,” Oyewumi told CoinDesk. Last week Oyewumi sold the first NFT she minted by herself on Mintable, and a friend helped her convert her crypto earnings to the local naira currency.      NFTs are all the rage this year, especially after the artist Beeple sold a digital art collage for $69.3 million through the British auction house Christie’s in March. Christie’s also announced Thursday it will be selling nine NFT collectibles known as CryptoPunks. This month, American-Senegalese R&B singer Akon launched AkoinNFT, an NFT platform to “supercharge and empower” artists and brands.      Now the trend has spread to Nigeria, where local financial institutions are banned from servicing crypto firms. This means Nigerians cannot convert digital assets to naira through traditional crypto exchanges. But that hasn’t wiped out crypto in Africa’s largest economy, thanks in part to its young and tech-savvy population. Users began switching to peer-to-peer platforms to avoid using banks and the use of crypto continues, as evidenced by how local artists like Oyewumi are embracing NFTs.      Although more Nigerian artists are entering the NFT space, they do so wary of the hype. Some Nigerian artists told CoinDesk that although minting their artwork comes with a number of advantages, they have concerns about the impact of NFTs on the art world in general.    Only good for already-established artists    Oyewumi feels the NFT culture is only beneficial to those artists who already have a large fanbase.      “If I put my art up as NFTs, sure, lots of people will see it. But some people will still prefer to purchase work from artists they already know. People might end up just creating pieces and uploading but not be able to sell anything,” Oyewumi said.      For instance, NFT art collector Michael Ugwu typically likes to check out an artist’s online presence and work before purchasing his or her art. A London-based music executive and entrepreneur of Nigerian descent, Ugwu owns around 40 NFT pieces by artists from around the world, including Nigeria. Ugwu told CoinDesk he only buys art he loves, but there is also a business perspective to consider.    Read more: These Black Artists Say NFTs Help Them Monetize Their Work    “I also want to know that there's going to be a global marketplace for that piece, if I want to sell it on the secondary market. It's much easier to sell a Fewocious, a Billelis or if you get lucky and get your hands on a Beeple. So based on those factors, from African artists I primarily acquire work that I feel has a global audience,” Ugwu said.      He added that for some African artists, minting their first pieces could be a challenge due to the Ethereum gas fees sometimes needed to sell an NFT.      “It's not cheap. A typical African artist may or may not have the $100 or $200 it's going to cost them per piece. So that's a small barrier,” Ugwu said, adding there are some platforms that waive or subsidize the minting fee.      Oyewumi feels new artists may also struggle with pricing their pieces and end up selling their art for less than what it’s worth.    All about the money    One NFT art piece in Ugwu’s collection is by the acclaimed Nigerian digital artist Osinachi.      Osinachi, 29, has made a name for himself as a digital artist and produces most of his work using Microsoft Word. When he first started making art in the late 2000s, his primary goal was to see his work displayed in a traditional art gallery. Over the years Osinachi reached out to numerous galleries but received no response.      Then he discovered crypto art.      In 2017, Osinachi learned people were posting artwork as NFT collectibles. With some help from the community, Osinachi minted a few of his works. In 2018, his art was featured in the Ethereal blockchain summit in New York.      The following year Osinachi’s dream came true when he was invited to show his work at a contemporary art gallery in Switzerland. In 2020, his art was featured in CoinDesk’s “The Most Influential People in Crypto” list. The same year, he quit his job as an academic librarian at the University of Nigeria Nsukka to focus on his art full time. A month ago he sold one of his digital paintings, “Am I pretty?,” for 13.2 ETH (around $27,600 as of Friday).    Read more: What Are NFTs and How Do They Work?    “A single NFT sale can translate to my one-year salary when I was working at the University of Nigeria,” Osinachi said.      Now, he is helping other Nigerian digital artists mint their work. Osinachi told CoinDesk that thanks to the NFT gold rush, digital artists like him are getting the attention they deserve and (thanks in part to the Beeple sale) learning that digital art can be priced as high as or higher than traditional art.      But he is also concerned about aspects of the traditional art world flooding the NFT space.      “Now, you also see marketplaces paying attention to certain big names. They care about the big artists that would make huge sales, and not necessarily about the art that is being made,” Osinachi said.    Tricky    Oyewumi, who set up her NFTs by herself, found the process to be complicated and experienced a number of unfamiliar technical issues.      She also saw a colleague’s art minted without the artist’s knowledge or permission. As NFTs went viral, scammers took to minting other artists’ work. In early March, illustrator Derek Laufman lashed out at NFT platform Rarible when a Twitter user notified him his art was listed on the website for sale without his knowledge.      Anthony Azekwoh, a 21-year-old chemical engineering student and digital artist, minted his first NFTs last month but finds the NFT space quite “tricky.”      “It’s been very complicated for me as a Nigerian. I come from a place where you make money through years of hard work, but with the NFT space it’s a situation where in a single minute you’re making millions of naira. I feel like the relationship most Nigerians or most people from places like Nigeria would have with the NFT space is, ‘Wow, how does any of this work? How is it possible?’” Azekwoh told CoinDesk.      But it’s not all bad.    Like Osinachi, Azekwoh is wary of the focus on monetization in the NFT world and determined to help other Nigerian artists. With his NFT earnings, he has set up a fundhttps://www.anthonyazekwoh.com/aaf that pledges 200,000 naira to young local artists between the ages of 15 and 25.  Read more: Beeple Says NFTs Are in a Bubble; $69.3M Mystery Buyer to Be Revealed Soon    Ugwu believes that although the NFT space in Nigeria is still small, it has the potential to propel Nigerianartists to the global stage if local digital art curators emerge in the coming years.      There are “a lot of great artists out of Africa, and Nigeria, who are focused on physical work, and I'm all for them getting a better understanding of the opportunities of NFTs,” Ugwu said.      Despite the many complexities, younger artists like Oyewumi and Azekwoh, inspired by veterans like Osinachi, are slowly working out the kinks and establishing themselves as global artists of the digital era.      NFT newcomer Oshomah sold his first multimedia artwork two weeks ago and has minted his second. Oshomah said that at the moment he could probably only name 10 Nigerian NFT artists, but there are hundreds of talented artists who, with some help, can enter the space in the months and years to come.      “You will see a lot of artists come out of Africa [who] will give Beeple a run for his money,” Oshomah said.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT | SPONSORED,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/13/the-nft-craze-is-helping-nigerian-artists-go-global,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/389298e122b4e0e2babb31b22fabc9f7a0088322-1024x932.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Established in late summer of last year, Gryphon raised the undisclosed round to fund a 100% renewables mining venture. The company is coming out of stealth at a time when public scrutiny of bitcoin mining and its perceived rampant energy appetite is burning hotter than ever.    Read more: The Frustrating, Maddening, All-Consuming Bitcoin Energy Debate    “Some other companies in the industry right now use renewables, but no other company is committed to 100% renewable energy. We’re excited about that, especially considering the backlash the industry has received lately,” Gryphon Chair Brittany Kaiser said to CoinDesk.      “We have committed to not using [fossil fuels] going forward, so anything we use will be either hydro, nuclear, solar or wind. I believe we’re the first bitcoin mining company [to do so],” echoed CEO and co-founder Rob Chang.      The team would not reveal where it will host the machines, though a press release says the machines can “access electricity costs as low as $0.013/kWh.”      Gryphon’s first fleet of miners, roughly 730 petahashes worth, is already set up and will launch in the coming months. The team hopes to scale this to at least two or as many as five exahashes by 2022 as they import new ASIC shipments, the team told CoinDesk.      The venture has plans to go public, but at an unspecified date, the team told CoinDesk.    The US bitcoin mining gold rush    Bitcoin’s price is up in light of Coinbase’s public listing tomorrow, an event that, perhaps better than any, edifies bitcoin’s increasingly accepted status in mainstream investor circles.      The same institutional attention has focused on bitcoin mining, as both old and new ventures in the United States ramp up operations to cash in on bitcoin’s bull run. Many continue to raise money to finance bulk purchases of ASICs or expand to new data centers.    Read more: Bitcoin Hashrate Surpasses All-Time High as Even 2014 ASICs Stay Profitable    Chang said Gryphon’s renewables-only model “was a good selling point,” adding that the energy question is an “item that is increasingly more important in the minds of investors.” Indeed, ""Shark Tank's"" Kevin O’Leary has swung his investor’s ax in bitcoin mining and told CoinDesk recently this topic was a concern to him and others in his circle.      “For some it was a nice onus, and for others it was the entire reason they wanted to invest in miners. It was a good mix,” Chang told CoinDesk.      Whether they are investing in renewables mining of flared/vented gas mining, U.S. investors are rushing for their stake in 2021’s digital gold rush.

42411651,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glR5eh,1618320600,What Coinbase’s Rise Says to the World,"Crypto exchange Coinbase is going public tomorrow. This may be the the clearest signal yet that the digital asset industry is here to stay.  You're reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Coinbase goes public (tomorrow)  The narrative  Coinbase's listing on Nasdaq sends a powerful signal of legitimacy to the U.S. cryptocurrency community, as well as to the crypto-curious in the traditional financial world. CoinDesk is providing round-the-clock coverage on this landmark listing.  Why it matters  In any other industry, this might not be a story. But because this is the crypto sector it is a significant one, and for good reason. Coinbase going public is possibly a model for other crypto companies looking to navigate U.S. federal securities laws, and Coinbase’s status as a Securities and Exchange Commission-regulated company might make it more attractive to investors on the fence about the digital asset space.  Breaking it down  A cryptocurrency company going public in the U.S. isn’t a first for the industry. Diginex, a blockchain services firm that runs the EQUOS.io exchange, went public last year and a number of other companies have also announced their intent to do the same. But Coinbase is the largest and most well-known exchange to go public in the U.S.  “I think this is a story because it’s crypto-related,” said Nelson Rosario, a partner at Smolinski Rosario Law. “It will add some measure of legitimacy to the space, just in general because Coinbase will now be a publicly traded company, apparently at a very high valuation and that will make people think a bit more seriously about companies in general in the space.”  Coinbase also benefits from its role in the crypto ecosystem, Rosario said: The exchange is one of the best-known entry points for individuals interested in cryptocurrencies, not to mention one of the older ones at nine years old.  Investing in $COIN may serve as a proxy investment for cryptocurrencies themselves. In other words, Coinbase stock could serve as an alternative for those investors who are not ready or able to directly invest in cryptocurrencies.  Bitcoin, though it is now over a decade old and has exceeded $1 trillion in market capitalization, is still a pretty young, at times very volatile investment. It makes sense that investors wary of these traits might look to a (theoretically) more stable alternative.  Existing companies with exposure to bitcoin or cryptocurrencies – cough, MicroStrategy – could also be sort of seen as proxy investments into those cryptocurrencies, though Coinbase has the added benefit of having a business that is explicitly crypto focused.  “Obviously some traditional investors might still be loath to actually purchase cryptocurrency but they might see the value in owning a share of the pie,” said J. Ashley Ebersole, a former SEC Enforcement attorney and current partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.  Rosario said that while investors could already invest in the digital asset world, Coinbase’s sheer size and role in the sector might be the tipping point for some investors who were previously cautious about entering the space.  Kristin Boggiano, co-founder and president of the U.S.-based CrossTower, agreed, telling CoinDesk that anyone who owns Coinbase stock “will be able to share in the development and growth of the digital asset industry.”  Coinbase can also provide a roadmap for the rest of the digital asset industry. Eschewing the traditional initial public offering (IPO) model, or the new and fairly hyped special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) model, Coinbase is just listing its shares on Nasdaq directly. Other companies can follow this model if they are interested in going public, Rosario said.  This is a crypto-specific example, though, Ebersole noted, saying, “It’s sort of blazing a trail but I don’t know that it’s changing the regulatory picture around what this space is actually doing and doing in a compliant way.”  Boggiano said Coinbase is blazing that trail. In her view, the exchange has established “an operational framework that has passed SEC standards,” which other exchanges like hers can look to moving forward.  Coinbase going public should also add a new level of transparency that the industry largely lacks, Ebersole said.  “If you’re an investor or a watcher in the crypto industry, you’ve had white papers and that kind of thing to date,” he said. “Depending on the issuer of a crypto asset, you’ve had various degrees of disclosure and information out there but having an entity that’s SEC-regulated and a reporting company is a whole different ball game.”  Dante Disparte departs Diem  Dante Disparte, who just served two years as the Diem Association (formerly Libra) executive vice chair, is joining crypto payments startup Circle as chief strategy officer and head of global policy.  “I’ve spent a good portion of the last two years really in a front row seat at what was the global policy conversation,” he told me.  In his view, USDC is a trusted payment instrument, “and Circle is doing it at the operational level.”  In his blog post introducing Disparte, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire wrote that the new executive would oversee the company’s global expansion operations.  In practice, this involves engaging with policymakers and adding to Circle’s existing licenses, Allaire said.  “This is about constructive engagement and actually constructing policies and we’re in the proverbial second inning, so there’s just a ton of work to do,” he said.  Disparte said this effort would have to go deeper than publishing white papers or holding forums in favor of “demystifying” the actual use cases blockchain-based tools can support.  These use cases also need to align with the public interest, he said, meaning cryptocurrencies (like Circle’s USDC) would have to support the underlying security found in the banking system, but provide the benefits of being an internet-enabled network.  “What you’ve done is decoupled being banked with costly fixed infrastructure like brick-and-mortar banks,” he said. “What we have to do is decouple being banked with costly KYC requirements … [this] doesn’t mean you necessarily introduce more risk.”  When ETF  We are at the first public comment deadline for the VanEck/Cboe bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) application and I gotta tell ya, not a lot of people weighed in. I’m writing this on a Friday (the comment deadline) and there are exactly five comments right now. That being said, people can still file comments, and the SEC has almost a month to make an initial decision on whether to approve, reject or extend the process.  The SEC also announced it was reviewing WisdomTree’s bitcoin ETF application (also filed with Cboe BZX), while Kryptoin filed for an ETF, bringing the total number of active applications to eight nine (a ninth was filed between me writing this and this being published).  Important details:  The SEC will make an initial decision to approve/reject or extend the comment period for the VanEck bitcoin ETF application by May 3.  The SEC will publish the WisdomTree proposal in the Federal Register within the next few days, which will tell us what the comment deadline and initial decision date will be.  The other applications need their exchange partner (like Cboe BZX or NYSE Arca) to file the 19b-4 forms, which will move the chains to the SEC’s side of the field.  Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard  We might see Gary Gensler and Rohit Chopra confirmed to their positions as chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission and director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, respectively, sometime this week. Additionally, Michael Mosier is now the acting director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, after former Director Kenneth Blanco stepped down.  Elsewhere:  The Accidental Crypto Lobbyist: My colleague Danny Nelson was trying to report on potential crypto legislation in West Virginia when he stumbled across some language he didn’t understand, but which would appear to have essentially banned crypto. So, like any good journalist, he mass-emailed every co-sponsor on the bill and asked. In response, two of the co-sponsors amended the bill to exclude that language.  Mysterious Filings Suggest Impostor Is Using Grayscale’s Name to Pump Obscure Coins: By me: Someone registered a pair of Grayscale Trusts that resemble the legitimate ones, but aren’t. The trusts, registered as LLCs, were for Nahmii and Theta. The teams behind both cryptocurrencies, as well as Grayscale itself, say they had nothing to do with these trusts. The question, then, is who did register these entities, and is this just a somewhat-more-sophisticated pumping scheme?  Bank of Russia Plans Prototype for Its Digital Ruble Design in December: The Russian central bank has published a new concept paper for the proposed digital ruble, with a prototype tentatively expected by this December, my colleague Anna Baydakova reports. Bank of Russia First Deputy Governor Olga Skorobogatova said during a press conference that this prototype would enable smart contract support and the bank is looking to support offline payments.  South Korean Prosecutors Sell (and Profit Off) Bitcoin Taken From Criminals: South Korean prosecutors made some 12 billion won (just under $11 million) after selling bitcoin seized in 2017 from the operator of an illegal pornography site, CoinDesk Korea’s Felix Im reported last week. At the time the bitcoin was seized, it was worth about 270 million won ($240,000).  Outside CoinDesk:  (Missoulian) Officials in Missoula County, Montana, have enacted local crypto mining ordinances which, among other things, address climate change issues by directing where mining facilities can be located and what sort of energy sources it can use. The Missoulian quotes County Commissioner Dave Strohmaier in explaining the new ordinances: ""We've made a commitment to pursue 100% clean electricity in our Missoula urban area by the year 2030 … And the last thing we wanted to do was to see any industries in our county be headed in the opposite trajectory and set those goals backward.""

42406192,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAesiKs,1618319458,Swiss Custody Firm METACO Primed to Offer DeFi to Banks,"A Switzerland-based cryptocurrency custody company is expanding its offering so that clients can get exposure to more esoteric areas of public blockchain such as decentralized finance (DeFi) and proof-of-stake (PoS) mining.      Announced Tuesday, METACO Harmonize brings together the company’s institution-grade vault solution with trading, asset flow and tokenization tech, allowing for peer-to-peer trading and access to the DeFi industry – a set of smart contracts providing bank-like services on the internet.      METACO is located in the middle of Switzerland’s burgeoning digital asset movement. Its clients include several large banks such as Standard Chartered Bank, BBVA and Gazprom Bank’s Swiss division.      Adrien Treccani, CEO and founder of METACO, said the first wave of demand for exposure to DeFi, staking and the like is coming from Swiss private banks that serve high-net-worth consumers, as opposed to large banks serving institutional clients.      “DeFi is not about technical capability, but about user experience,” said Treccani in an interview, adding:    “It's about simplifying these complex smart-contract interactions into something a bank (and ultimately the end-client of the bank) is able to use on a daily basis – generate yields, or lend or borrow – but without having to understand the inner details of the multiple smart-contract method calls that are involved.”  METACO hiring push    In addition to its product launch, METACO has also announced two senior hires: Andre Israel, formerly a banking expert at Accenture, joins as chief operating officer while former Standard Chartered Bank exec Craig Perrin is now vice president of sales.      Recently, METACO made a joint announcement with IBM, foretelling the U.S. software giant’s ambitions beyond enterprise blockchain, looking at cryptocurrency through the lens of custody infrastructure. Treccani made clear that IBM’s ambitions include the full gamut of public decentralized protocols going forward.    Read more: IBM Ventures Further Into Crypto Custody With METACO, Deutsche Bank Tie-Ups    “IBM has great ambitions with public ledgers and not just permissioned ledgers, as an infrastructure provider,” Treccani said. “In a broad sense, custody, staking, DeFi are all of direct interest to IBM. Even though we presented these joint announcements as a way to promote their fantastic hardware in the context of digital asset management, we have joint ambitions which go beyond hardware.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/04/13/swiss-custody-firm-metaco-primed-to-offer-defi-to-banks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d5ea072e1f2ff7279cfe0c65c7d6e527913854f4-1500x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42406180,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAesiA3,1618319394,"US Inflation Rises Faster Than Expected In March, but Unlikely to Deter Fed","U.S. headline inflation rose to a 12-month pace of 2.6% in March, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics reported in its latest CPI report, accelerating from the 1.7% increase reported last month.      The pace exceeded economists' average estimate for a 2.5% increase.      The gauge of consumer prices is now rising at its fastest since August 2018, largely due to base effects from the coronavirus pandemic-induced recession that rattled the economy a year ago, when the lockdown-induced drop in demand sent costs tumbling for many goods and services.      The CPI report is particularly important for some cryptocurrency investors who view bitcoin (BTC) as a hedge against inflation and ongoing currency debasement. However, concerns about higher inflation beyond the 2% threshold could cause the Federal Reserve to consider tightening monetary policy, which could weigh on risk assets.      Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has said he views higher inflation as temporary and not serious enough for the U.S. central bank to alter its record-low interest rate policies.    On a month-to-month basis, headline March CPI increased 0.6%, beating expectations for a 0.5% rise after rising 0.4% in February.  The March one-month increase was the largest rise since a 0.6% increase in August 2012, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.  The gasoline index continued to increase, rising 9.1% in March, and accounted for nearly half of the seasonally adjusted increase in CPI.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET,Damanick Dantes,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/13/us-inflation-rises-faster-than-expected-in-march-but-unlikely-to-deter-fed,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/38f6237d3a3edf39ca42fbc55e877cbfc8ec592d-1385x865.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42406194,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAesiMq,1618318834,"Ethereum Hub ConsenSys Raises $65M From JPMorgan, Mastercard, UBS, Others","Ethereum’s biggest supporter is back on track with the close of a carefully constructed funding round.      ConsenSys, an Ethereum development operation headquartered in Brooklyn, N.Y., has raised $65 million from financial institutions JPMorgan, Mastercard and UBS, as well as leading firms in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space.      Having toughed it out through the crypto winter of 2018-2019, Tuesday’s bullish fundraising announcement is further evidence ConsenSys has found its footing. The firm has now been successfully restructured into two parts: a core software business (CSI) and an investment and incubation arm known as ConsenSys Mesh.      In addition to the big banks, the $65 million round included Filecoin’s Protocol Labs, DeFi’s Maker Foundation, Fenbushi, The LAO, Sam Bankman-Fried’s Alameda Research, CMT Digital, China’s Greater Bay Area Homeland Development Fund, Quotidian Ventures and Liberty City Ventures.      Several firms invested with Ethereum-based stablecoins, DAI and USDC, ConsenSys said in a statement.      Read more: ConsenSys Confidential: Ethereum Builder Is Back in Growth Mode, Document Reveals      Last year, ConsenSys brokered a deal with JPMorgan to acquire Quorum, the enterprise-focused Ethereum client that now forms an in-house software stack of Codefi, Diligence, Infura, MetaMask and Truffle.      The general tightening of the ship has seen ConsenSys appear to chart a course away from consulting and services, towards being more product- and revenue-focused. MetaMask – a key gateway to the world of DeFi – counts over 3 million monthly active users and ConsenSys earns a sliver of fees on the wallet’s $1.95 billion token swap feature.      Founder and CEO Joe Lubin said ConsenSys was always a product company – only it was embedded in an ecosystem and dependent on a technology that was extremely immature.      Today things have moved on some. For example, with Mastercard as an investor, ConsenSys engineers are using the Quorum blockchain to build a permissioned network for commerce and finance.      “The round was pretty carefully constructed,” Lubin said in an interview. “It's almost all strategics, and we intended for them to be in different industries. Some in the traditional economy, some in the decentralized economy, and we also intended for it to be regionally distributed.”      The ConsenSys chief could not go into detail at this time about what was being built with the large financial institutions that invested in the round, but said:      “We have multi-year commercial arrangements with JPMorgan and Mastercard, and have commercial activity with UBS.”    ConsenSys roadmap    Looking ahead, Quorum’s enterprise-friendly connection to Ethereum mainnet will have managed services launched around it. Also driving the theme of convergence, MetaMask Institutional, which is in beta, will roll out soon.      “MetaSwaps, launched first into the consumer platform, is providing swap trading capabilities for nearly the entire universe of active tokens,” said Lubin. “We can take that next, wrap it in APIs and make it available to developers in both Infura and in Truffle, so developers can build swapping directly into their software. You can also package it up into a module and enable trading on Quorum systems, say, on a cloud.”      As such, ConsenSys is positioned to build the infrastructure needed to make institutional DeFi a reality.      Read more: Microsoft, EY and ConsenSys Tout New Way for Big Biz to Use Public Ethereum      With this in mind, Lubin pointed to the Baseline Protocol, a way of enabling organizations to link their systems of record to one another using a global frame of reference: the Ethereum mainnet.      “Tokenization is happening in the Baseline Protocol, so you can pay for inventory with tokens,” Lubin said. ""Invoices on some projects right now are starting to get tokenized. So you can imagine factoring invoices and trading those and in markets. It's happening relatively quickly.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/04/13/ethereum-hub-consensys-raises-65m-from-jpmorgan-mastercard-ubs-others,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d8e10a2866bdd26b34eccc37112effc08fce331e-1500x1015.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406198,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAesiPn,1618311600,What Would Biden’s Tax Hikes Mean for Bitcoin?,"U.S. President Joe Biden's proposal to raise corporate taxes to help pay for increased infrastructure spending and other economic stimulus programs could stunt this year's rally in bitcoin.      Analysts say the largest cryptocurrency has benefited from the government's record budget deficits ever since the coronavirus hit the economy in full force in March 2020, with the Federal Reserve helping to finance extra government borrowing by purchasing U.S. Treasury bonds.      Some investors see bitcoin as a useful hedge against inflation, viewing ultra-loose monetary policy and long-term currency debasement as tailwinds for the cryptocurrency. Others see bitcoin as a risky asset whose price has rallied because of the easy financial conditions, similar to the way stocks have pushed toward fresh records despite the economic turbulence.      Whatever the case, any tax hikes, which still face steep resistance from corporate lobbyists as well as lawmakers from the opposition Republican Party, might represent the first effort to impose fiscal discipline in the U.S. since the coronavirus hit.      “The U.S. actions are not bullish for bitcoin, as tax increases could be a thorn in the recovery and will drag down investments,” wrote Edward Moya, analyst at Oanda, a foreign exchange brokerage firm, in an email to CoinDesk.      Included in Biden's proposals is an increase in both the corporate tax rate and the individual rate for high earners – the first major tax hike since 1993.      Higher taxes could stall the economic recovery at a time when the Federal Reserve is increasingly vocal about the need for ongoing monetary and fiscal support. Prospects for slower growth could trigger profit-taking across risk assets including cryptocurrencies.      Raising taxes could also offset the widening federal budget deficit, which is estimated to be about 10% of GDP in 2021, the second largest since 1945, exceeded only by the 15% shortfall recorded last year, according to the Congressional Budget Office.      “An improving fiscal and debt sustainability outlook could lead to a stronger dollar and put pressure on crypto assets like bitcoin, which some investors view as a hedge against inflation and currency debasement,” Garrick Hileman, head of research at Blockchain.com, told CoinDesk in an email.      There's plenty of room for disagreement. Ariel Zetlin-Jones, an economics professor at Carnegie Mellon University who has studied cryptocurrency markets, told CoinDesk the relationship between economic output and effective corporate tax rates is quite weak, suggesting that other factors might be the key determinant of growth.      It's also possible the additional tax revenue might simply embolden lawmakers' spending plans.      “The likelihood of responsible fiscal budgeting remains low,” wrote Alexander Blum, managing director at Two Prime, a digital asset investment firm. “Continued support from the Fed means there will be more capital looking for new areas to invest in growth.”      That means investors still might look to higher-risk, higher-reward assets such as cryptocurrencies, which have at times in the past been uncorrelated with traditional assets such as stocks and bonds.      For now, more fiscal spending and continued monetary easing appears to be the new normal, both positive for risk assets. Higher taxes are still just a proposal.      “The present scenario is unprecedented in scale, where a pandemic has driven massive stimulus packages that require continues funding and money printing,” wrote Joe DiPasquale, CEO of BitBull Capital, in an email to CoinDesk.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Damanick Dantes,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/13/what-would-bidens-tax-hikes-mean-for-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bbba09db005363ddaaea197a7610c963bd35cb78-1200x857.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406188,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAesiGw,1618308000,Ex-CIA Director Says Criminals Will Move Away From Bitcoin in New Lobbying Group's First Report,"Potential money launderers aren’t really using bitcoin – and of those who are, many are likely to move away from the cryptocurrency due to the fact every transaction is recorded and visible to all.      That’s one conclusion of a report published by the Crypto Council for Innovation, a new lobbying group hoping to inform and influence regulatory actions around the cryptocurrency sector. The report, penned by former Central Intelligence Agency Acting Director Michael Morell, is the first salvo in this effort.      ""As more seizures and arrests are made, we believe illicit actors – who are technology agnostic – will continue to move away from using bitcoin for money-laundering purposes to other avenues that make it easier for them to hide their activities,"" the report said.      The council aims to “move the needle” in how governments approach crypto regulation, said Gus Coldebella, chief policy officer at Paradigm and one of the heads of the new organization, which was announced last week.      “We have a lot of policy makers who are becoming aware of crypto and at the same time might harbor some misconceptions about it,” said Coldebella, who’s also served in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and was previously at Circle.      Morell, who was hired to produce the report through his consulting firm, Beacon Global Strategies, said he was interested in determining if the conventional wisdom – that bitcoin in particular is a major tool for money launderers – was objectively accurate.      In turn, he said he believes that the role bitcoin might play in illicit activities should determine how much attention is given to it, versus other national security issue like China developing its own sovereign digital currency.      “If we needed to be concerned about illicit finance and bitcoin, by all means let’s focus on that. But if conventional wisdom is not that accurate we should be going full steam ahead on competing,” he said.      The former longtime civil servant was joined by his colleagues Josh Kirshner and Thomas Schoenberger in producing the report, Morell said, though the conclusions remain his own. He doesn’t anticipate publishing anything else on the crypto industry specifically.    Joining a crowd    When asked why create an organization rather than join existing groups like the Blockchain Association or the Chamber for Digital Commerce, Coldebella said the new council wants to focus more on international regulations rather than the U.S. government.      Fidelity Digital Assets, Coinbase, Square and Paradigm are the organization's founding members.      “Crypto is, as you know, inherently borderless and it makes sense not just to address the policymakers in one country or one region, but across the world and if we are to be successful we should be doing those things, the education piece and the iterating with policymakers piece in a global, coordinated way,” Coldebella said.      As more and more people get involved in the crypto sector, it will draw increasing attention from different regulatory entities, he said.      He also noted it is important that the industry engages with the governments of the world because these governments will enforce regulations regardless.      “If we don’t engage with governments as an industry, then governments are still going to do what they’re going to do without the benefit of hearing from people who are literate in crypto and have been thinking about these issues for years,” he said.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/13/ex-cia-director-says-criminals-will-move-away-from-bitcoin-in-new-lobbying-groups-first-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fe52cd1bfd9f25fe620a0a47a127e4f170c93709-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A court document from Judge Sarah Netburn of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, filed on Friday, shows the SEC's request for eight years of financial data belonging to Ripple's Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen has been denied.      CEO Garlinghouse and Executive Chairman Larsen asked the courts to quash the request by the securities regulator last month, labeling the request as a ""wholly inappropriate overreach.""      The development means Ripple has scored a second victory in its fight against the regulator after having won the right last week to look into the SEC's internal communications over how it classifies cryptocurrency as a security.

Alongside cutting costs, the project aims to provide a ""connection point"" for third parties to deliver applications to its members, according to the release.      Some of the world's largest insurance companies including The Hanover and Selective Insurance Group as well as technology and service providers Chainyard, KatRisk and MOBI will also be involved, the foundation said.      The foundation said the project's first use case will tackle regulatory reporting within the Property and Casualty (P&C) insurance industry also known as general insurance. Sectors beyond P&C are expected to be supported ""in the coming months.""

42406193,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAesiLr,1618304236,"Bitcoin, Ether Hit New All-Time Highs on Eve of Coinbase Listing","Bitcoin and ether, the two biggest cryptocurrencies, surged to new all-time high prices on Tuesday, the day before the highly anticipated Coinbase listing on Nasdaq.      Prices for bitcoin (BTC), the oldest cryptocurrency and the largest by market value, rose 6% on the day, reaching as high as $63,661 around 15:40 coordinated universal time (11:40 a.m. ET), based on CoinDesk 20 data. Ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain and the second-largest overall, set a new high water mark of $2,271.      Analysts had signaled that the extra publicity and investor-relations chatter surrounding the Coinbase listing might lead to an uptick in the pace of cryptocurrency adoption or, at the very least, speculation.      Such heightened demand comes at a time when data extracted from the Bitcoin blockchain appear to show more investors pulling the cryptocurrency down from big exchanges, ostensibly a sign they might be moving their holdings offline for the long term and have little intention of selling.      ""The dynamics have changed quite dramatically this year,"" Simon Peters, an analyst with the trading platform eToro, said in an emailed comment. ""Demand is flooding the market from institutions just as large amounts of bitcoin and ethereum are increasingly being taken offline and holders are transferring them to their own wallets. There is only one outcome from that, and investors should expect higher highs and higher lows throughout the year.""    The rally comes after weeks of bitcoin trading sluggishly in a narrow range below $60,000.  Chart patterns suggest bitcoin's price has broken out of its recent trend and isn't expected to hit price resistance until it rises to $68,000-$70,000.  ""Cryptocurrency markets are showing robust strength ahead of the Coinbase IPO as bitcoin moves into the all-time high territory,"" Matthew Dibb, COO and co-founder of Stack Funds, told CoinDesk  ""A re-rating of crypto assets is definitely on the cards following the $100B valuations of Coinbase's shares (COIN),"" Dibb added.  Analysts projections for COIN's listing are ranging from $19 billion to $230 billion, as discussed last week.  COIN shares will provide traditional investors exposure to a crypto platform that earns money from fees while avoiding the volatility and risk of crypto assets themselves. ""Coinbase will be a lower beta play,"" Delphi Digital's Kevin Kelly told Bloomberg.  The exchange recently disclosed Q1 revenue growth of 840% year on year, blowing past analysts' estimates by a big margin.  Alternative cryptocurrencies, in general, have performed better than bitcoin in recent weeks, pushing the latter's market dominance to two-year lows near 55%, according to data source TradingView.

42406190,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAesiJt,1618272060,Thorchain Is Ready to Grease the Wheels of Crypto-to-Crypto Trading,"Thorchain, a standalone blockchain for decentralized crypto trading, is set to go live Tuesday, potentially lubricating the gears of a global $2 trillion market six months into a bull run.      Three years in the making (a lifetime in crypto), Thorchain works a lot like other automated market makers (AMMs) such as Bancor and Uniswap, but with an important difference: It enables trades of real cryptocurrencies from completely different blockchains – not “wrapped” or synthetic versions. With each new blockchain that can trade over Thorchain, the so-called ""chaosnet"" expands.      ""April 13 is delivering on the initial promises of the white paper: Delivering on a multichain chaosnet,"" Chad Barraford, the technical lead at Thorchain, told CoinDesk in a phone call. ""You'll be able to swap freely from one chain to another, one asset to another.""      If it works as intended, users will be able to make such swaps with real currencies (not an ersatz version like wrapped BTC on the Ethereum network) and without having to trust an intermediary. AMMs have been the leading kind of decentralized exchange (DEX) that are key to the decentralized finance (DeFi) boom on Ethereum, the second-largest blockchain.      Bringing trustless trading to many of the biggest chains while skipping the friction of making a copy of a coin on one chain seems likely to drive a lot of activity. Plus, centralized exchanges that hold your assets have a bad habit of losing them.      The Thorchain launch is also a reminder of the long-term competitive threat DEXs pose to centralized venues like Coinbase ahead of that company's hotly anticipated stock listing.      Thorchain will start by allowing trades of bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), litecoin (LTC), bitcoin cash (BCH) and Binance Chain’s BNB. More will come shortly. For example, Barraford said the code for dogecoin (DOGE) is basically ready.      For details about which cryptocurrencies have been scoped out for addition, interested readers can look at Thorchain's regular technical updates on Medium.      Thorchain is based on Tendermint, the consensus protocol associated with the Cosmos ecosystem.    Swapping    Thorchain uses a mechanic that's very similar to that pioneered by Bancor. Sticking with the mythological motif, the native token of Thorchain is known as RUNE. Every token in Thorchain is matched with an equal amount in value of its RUNE token.      When a user initiates a trade between, say, BCH and LTC, under the hood it becomes two trades. First, the user trades BCH for RUNE and then the RUNE gets traded for LTC. Provided it’s all done quickly, this should work out to basically the same thing as swapping directly between BCH and LTC.      Bancor does this with its BNT token. Uniswap, in its first version, paired every ERC-20 token it listed with ETH, though in version 2.0, Uniswap became a lot more flexible, enabling pairs of any two tokens.      Unlike Bancor or Uniswap, however, Thorchain is capable of trading the real assets of multiple unconnected blockchains, not representations of them.      ""If you want to swap layer 1 real bitcoin with layer 1 real ETH, you can do it,"" Baraford said. The team is developing an Asgard X wallet that will be built to interact directly with Thorchain and all its included blockchains, so it can store the coins from those networks.      Cosmos has already launched inter-blockchain communication (or IBC) and Thorchain will integrate with that soon, which will enable it to add many more blockchains. In its most recent developer update, the team reported that ""a development partner has been found and will begin building IBC bridges.""      While Thorchain's functionality is not live, its token is available and traded. As of this writing, it's trading at around $11.20, up almost 90% in the last 30 days, according to CoinGecko.    History lesson    Thorchain has been around a long time. The first version was started and largely abandoned in 2018, according to Barraford.      Since then, a cryptographic innovation known as threshold signatures have been invented and the Cosmos ecosystem has developed much more fully. In 2019 the fundamental idea of trustless exchange between blockchains was revised and redeveloped to incorporate these advances in the technology.      ""In a threshold, you have multiple people coming together to make a single signature without anyone having access to the private key,"" Baraford explained.      The team that came together around building Thorchain decided to stay largely anonymous and to avoid attention as much as possible.      The core team has a stated goal of disbanding in summer of 2022 and turning everything over to RUNE holders.    Getting involved    As on any AMM, the project needs liquidity providers to get involved in order to work as effectively as possible. If there are few parties willing to buy or sell an asset, the final price of a trade can vary widely from the participants’ expectations. The deeper each pool is, the less such slippage there will be on any trade. Users can post an equal amount of any token it covers and RUNE to the system and start earning trading fees.      ""You can provide bitcoin into the network and that bitcoin can earn a bitcoin yield,"" Baraford said.      Thorchain also addresses an issue for those who supply liquidity to networks, known as impermanent loss. That is, if the value of one token in a pool goes down relative to the other, the value of their deposit can shrink in fiat terms even though their total deposit in the underlying tokens is increasing.      ""One of the important things about this network is it has impermanent loss protection,"" Barraford said, as long as you stay in for 100 days.      That said, Barraford noted there's seldom impermanent loss when liquidity providers stay in that long. However, Thorchain effectively takes a snapshot of the value of any liquidity deposit. If the user’s fiat value has fallen below where it was when they deposited due to rebalancing, Thorchain will make up for it out of RUNE reserves.      Liquidity providers will also earn new RUNE emissions on their deposit. ""The amount of RUNE that goes into each pool is dependent on how much revenue has come from that pool in that block,"" Barraford said. The freshest RUNE goes to the most active pools.      Very nearly all of the RUNE reserves will be distributed in the first two years of operation.      Multicoin Capital released a report on Thorchain in February, noting that the Austin, Texas-based investment firm has a major position in its RUNE token. The co-authors wrote:      ""Most investors have exposure to the blockchains they think will win; however, few actually have exposure to the growing heterogeneity of the overall ecosystem. ... [W]e believe THORChain’s RUNE token is the best way to invest in this thesis.""",POSITIVE,BCH | ETH | RUNE,BCH | ETH | EXCHANGE | TRADING | RUNE,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/04/13/thorchain-is-ready-to-grease-the-wheels-of-crypto-to-crypto-trading,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/83805890be1d60162b7b8159e133b424dff894fd-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
