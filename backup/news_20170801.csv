42427682,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL2ofh,1501625732,What Happened to Bitcoin: A Recap of the Blockchain's Big Split,"It wasn't the first attempt to fork the bitcoin blockchain, but it was certainly the most memorable.  As reported earlier today, Bitcoin Cash, a new cryptocurrency, was created when a group of miners ""forked"" from the main bitcoin blockchain – in short, they switched to a new, incompatible software that changed the rules by which the network would function.  Over the course of the day, miners backing the project succeeded in officially branching off, ultimately adding blocks to the separate blockchain, and in the process, building what they believe could come to be a growing economy centered around its development.  In doing so, they also marked the end of a controversial effort that began as just one of many ways to chart a new technical roadmap in the face of a wide range of alternatives.  Off to the races  As developer and Paxos principal architect Jimmy Song predicted earlier this week, the day's defining moment came at around 8:20 a.m. ET – the time miners running the new software had agreed to begin diverging from the main chain.  That pivotal period started at approximately 12:37 p.m. UTC (or for those keeping time in bitcoin terms, block number 478,558), as it was then that Bitcoin Cash miners began to seek what would become the new network's first block.  Here, they were working under specific constraints – the block had to be larger than the standard 1 MB size limit still imposed on the main bitcoin blockchain.  The waiting game  Yet, as detailed on CoinDesk's live blog (which you can catch up on here), the creation of first block perhaps took longer than supporters had hoped.  Given the relatively small amount of miners running the new software, and the fact that the software carried over with it the same difficulty that regulates how easy it is to find blocks based on the number of miners, Bitcoin Cash struggled to keep up with the main bitcoin network, which quickly grew in size.  Indeed, as hours passed, some observers began questioning whether miners would continue the pursuit at all (given that they were missing out on bitcoin's mining rewards by doing so).  The idea emerged that Bitcoin Cash could go as long as a day without a new block, given the difficulty and the low hash rate, circulated among some observers.  BitGo engineer Jameson Lopp ultimately had the closest call: ""It's likely going to take at least several hours,"" he tweeted.  A block is found  Then, it happened.  At about 6:14 p.m. UTC, ViaBTC mined the first Bitcoin Cash block, which came in at a block size of 1.915 MB. That block contained 6,985 transactions, according to public data.  Since then, four Bitcoin Cash blocks have been created, though only the first of the initial five had a block larger than 1 MB. By comparison, the most recent block contained 520 transactions, using about 0.4 MB of space in the transaction block.  With the creation of those blocks, Bitcoin Cash entered a new phase in which it became an actual network – albeit one that was given to delays.  The block's passage also seemed to spur launches on digital currency exchanges, with trading now live on bourses like Kraken, TheRockTrading and OKCoin, among others.  What comes next  As for what's to follow, it's really up to the market to decide.  With exchanges listing the coin and newly-found Bitcoin Cash owners taking control of their assets, one of the big questions will be what happens with the price of the digital asset.  One prospect that does seem likely: a sea-change in the tenor of the years-long scaling debate, the disagreements over which arguably led to the events of today.  When it comes to bigger blocks or a more nuanced approach – it seems it's now up to the market to decide.

Called District0x, the project aims to use ethereum smart contracts to power decentralized marketplaces and community applications. Offering 600 million District0x Network Tokens (DNT) to buyers, the ICO started on July 18 and ended on August 1.  According to data from the ethereum blockchain, a total of 2,394 participants contributed 43,170 ether to the project, an amount that was slightly less than a tentative cap of $10 million imposed by project creators.  Notably, the project excludes contributions from citizens or residents from the U.S. – a move commonly adopted to avoid regulatory issues. In recent days, regulators in the US and Singapore have issued new statements that indicate some types of token offerings may be captured under securities law.  Despite such warnings, though, July is proving to be a record month for ICOs fundraising, with more than $500m raised by 29 projects as of July 26, according to CoinDesk data.

After running into roadblocks this morning, miners were able to successfully create a block on a new blockchain, called Bitcoin Cash, at roughly 2:14 p.m. ET today. The move effectively finds the miners breaking away from the main bitcoin network and forging ahead with a different technical roadmap.  The block in question was mined by mining firm ViaBTC, according to a Bitcoin Cash block explorer hosted by data provider BlockDozer. ViaBTC later acknowledged the finding on Twitter and WeChat.  All in all, the event came nearly six hours after block 478,558 – the point at which miners attempted to start the separation.  Network data shows that the Bitcoin Cash block contained 6,985 transactions, with a block size of 1.915 MB – nearly double the size of this parameter on the original chain. The data point is notable given that Bitcoin Cash was designed to increase network capacity by offering a blockchain with a larger block size.  According to CoinMarketCap, the price of Bitcoin Cash is trading at roughly $219 on digital currency exchange Kraken. The exchange's top marketplace, for the BTC/BCH trading pair, is reporting more than $3m in volume since launch.

HKEX chief executive Charles Li detailed the plan, which would play out through a separate venture dubbed HKEX Private Market, in an August 1 note.  The disclosure came in response to a question about tapping local technology resources – and whether Hong Kong is positioned to do so. Though no firm launch date has been disclosed, Li said that the platform would kick off sometime in 2018.  ""The Private Market will serve as a 'nursery' for early stage companies before they are ready to enter public markets,"" he explained. ""They can conduct pre-IPO financing and other activities on an off-exchange venue not under the regulatory remit of the Securities and Futures Ordinance.""  As reported  previously, Li has been eyeing on the blockchain technology to upscale the operation of HKEX. Earlier this year, during a media event, Li disclosed a three-to-four year plan to reduce costs at the exchange, which could ultimately move to integrate the tech into its post-trade systems.

42427648,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL2lZh,1501598040,"Bitcoin Is Forking, But Bitcoin Cash Hasn't Been Created Yet","The split of the bitcoin blockchain has begun.  Earlier today a subset of bitcoin's miners began operating a different software in order to create a competing cryptocurrency called Bitcoin Cash. The move would effectively find a minority of users forging ahead with their own blockchain, one that shares a transaction history with bitcoin.  As previously reported, Bitcoin Cash – which raises the size of the network's transaction blocks while doing away with other capacity upgrades – is being advanced as an alternative to existing scaling efforts. Some of those who backed prior efforts aimed at raising the block size have since moved to support Bitcoin Cash.  Yet the split is far from complete.  The divergence started at approximately 12:37 p.m. UTC, according to data from BTCForkMonitor.info, when the network reached block 478,558. It's here that Bitcoin Cash needs to process a block that is greater than 1 megabyte (MB) in size in order to seal the split.  Thus far, that hasn't happened, and some observers believe that it could take hours or more for that block to be created. In the meantime, the original bitcoin chain has continued, reaching block 478,570 as of press time.  Also possible is that, should no new blocks be found, Bitcoin Cash could be abandoned. So far, a major mining pool for the currency has attracted more than 1 petahash of mining power.  Market impact  Bitcoin markets, which rose to a high of $2,925.03 during today's trading according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), are currently trading at around $2,732, representing a decline of about 4.9 percent.  Traders had been preparing for the looming split, though in most cases, the prospect of receiving what is an effectively a doubling of coins – brought about as a result of the two networks sharing a transaction history as well as an identical key structure – was mostly seen as a benefit.  Futures for Bitcoin Cash (BCC or BCH), which have been listed by the mining pool and project proponent ViaBTC, are currently trading for roughly $384, according to CoinMarketCap.com  Saw image via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,BCH,BCH | BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2017/08/01/bitcoin-is-forking-but-bitcoin-cash-hasnt-been-created-yet,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d765e67c4a33b842153cc3e1e4bd3f0740568e4f-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42427655,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL2llh,1501596953,Marketplace Lender Blackmoon to Launch Ethereum Token Management Platform,"A marketplace lender that boasts $100 million in deal volume is launching an ethereum platform for ""tokenized investment vehicles.""  Released by Blackmoon Financial Group today, Blackmoon Crypto is designed to enable verified asset managers to create and manage tokenized funds in a legally compliant manner. Operating in nine countries, Blackmoon has attracted $2.5 million to date in investment from firms including Target Global and Flint Capital.  The company, which operates the Blackmoon Lending Marketplace, launched in the U.S. last year, and has offices in New York and Cyprus. Blackmoon Crypto is incorporated in Singapore.  While tokens may seem like a departure for a business focused on marketplace lending, Oleg Seydak, CEO of Blackmoon Financial Group, described it as ""complementary.""  In interview, Seydak argued that tokenized funds simply need an industry standard for private and institutional investors.  ""The main idea of Blackmoon Crypto is provide a legal and technical framework for asset managers to create and continuously manage tokenized investment funds,"" he told CoinDesk, adding:  ""Blackmoon will issue crypto tokens that [asset managers] will be able to distribute among investors in a new vehicle. At the same time, we'll provide [them] with the legal framework to effectively incorporate as a legal entity.""  What about the SEC?  In context, however, the announcement for Russia-based Blackmoon comes at an interesting time.  For one, last week was a tumultuous one for the crypto token sector, with the SEC issuing guidance that said tokens can be considered securities. While expected, the guidance has created an air of uncertainty around the legal future of token issuance – and what is compliant and what is not.  However, Blackmoon has clarified that it will not be operating with U.S. investors. ""Such an organization should be licensed as a broker dealer,"" explained Seydak.  Blackmoon will, however, apply for a broker dealer license and aims to have that in place within the next nine to 12 months.  ""Then we will be able to sell securities to sophisticated and accredited investors in the U.S,"" Seydak said.  For now, he noted that U.S. investment managers will be able to participate if they are selling to investors outside the country.  Timeline to launch  Overall, this means that Blackmoon has a timeline in place to have three funds on the platform by early 2018.  Going forward, the company will issue its first ethereum-based tokens, called Blackmoon Crypto tokens (BMC), on the platform in September.  ""The first two funds on the platform are based on asset classes we operate within the original Blackmoon,"" Seydak explained.  With this step kicking off the operation, Blackmoon Crypto aims to introduce its first external manager to the platform in Q1 2018.

42427650,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL2ldh,1501593680,Singapore Central Bank: Token Sales May Be Subject to Securities Laws,"Singapore's central bank has issued new statements on the offering of digital tokens, stating that some issuances may fall under its definition of a security.  The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) outlined its position on token sales – known more commonly as initial coin offerings, or ICOs – in a new statement published this morning. The regulator indicated that it considers some tokens as securities, depending on their underlying basis and the context of their issuance – a stance similar to the one expressed last week by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  The MAS explained in its release:  ""MAS has observed that the function of digital tokens has evolved beyond just being a virtual currency. For example, digital tokens may represent ownership or a security interest over an issuer's assets or property. Such tokens may therefore be considered an offer of shares or units in a collective investment scheme under the [Securities and Futures Act]. Digital tokens may also represent a debt owed by an issuer and be considered a debenture under the SFA.""  Token sales that fall under the MAS definition of a security would trigger relevant requirements, including the need to submit a prospectus with the central bank before the sale takes place. ""Issuers and intermediaries"" of such tokens, the MAS went on to explain, would also be subject to licensing requirements.  Like the SEC, the MAS indicated that companies that allow for the exchange of ICO-derived tokens would need to be sanctioned as well.  ""In addition, platforms facilitating secondary trading of such tokens would also have to be approved or recognised by MAS as an approved exchange or recognised market operator respectively under the SFA,"" the central bank said.  Ultimately, the MAS recommended that prospective token issuers seek out legal advice, as well as consult with the institution itself.  ""All issuers of digital tokens, intermediaries facilitating or advising on an offer of digital tokens, and platforms facilitating trading in digital tokens should therefore seek independent legal advice to ensure they comply with all applicable laws, and consult MAS where appropriate,"" the MAS said.

42427660,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL2lvh,1501588808,The Problem with Bitcoin Price Charts (Explained in Two Charts),"Last week, I wrote about the different methods used to calculate and express daily price changes in stocks and cryptocurrencies.  The big takeaway? Since cryptocurrencies trade in a 24/7 fashion, there is no closing price to quote. Instead, daily price changes are calculated by comparing the current price of the asset to the price of the same asset 24 hours earlier, and calculating the percent change between the two numbers.  Using this trailing 24-hour percent change calculation, however, can produce some very strange results.  As I wrote last week:  ""What's the practical effect of this rolling denominator? In the simplest terms, it means that if you're just looking at the percentage change over the last 24 hours, you can't tell whether you're seeing real-time price movement in the cryptocurrency or just residual price volatility from the day before.""  Today, I want to show you two examples of just how wildly distorting that rolling calculation can seem, using two hypothetical charts depicting bitcoin prices over a 48-hour timeframe.  Chart 1  In our first example, we have a chart that shows the price of bitcoin rising about 3 percent in Day 1, as depicted by the yellow bar.  On Day 2, bitcoin essentially goes sideways for 24 hours.  Now, take a look at what happens to the 24-hour price change during Day 2, as shown by the dark brown bar.  When Day 2 begins, the 24-hour change displays an increase of just over 3 percent. As the day progresses, however, the 24-hour change begins to ""roll off"" – until this figure hits zero on at 11:59pm.  Of course, all the 24-hour price change depicted by the brown bar during Day 2 happened when there was very little change in the value of bitcoin: the movement in 24-hour price change came entirely from ""legacy"" price volatility from the prior day.  Chart 2  The example shown in the second chart is even more unusual.  On Day 1, the price of bitcoin is very volatile.  Between 3 a.m. and 5:30 a.m., the price of bitcoin spikes up about 18 percent on a straight price basis – then bounces down a bit, between 6 a.m. and 7 a.m., and finally crashes over 20 percent between 11 a.m. and 4 p.m.  On Day 2, bitcoin trades basically sideways all day.  As the price stays flat, however, the 24-hour price change bounces all over the map. First, the 24-hour price change crashes more than 15 percent, then it spikes up over 8 percent, crashes down around 15 percent again, and ultimately ""rolls off"" at zero at day's end – showing absolutely no change over the course of the 24-hour period.  For investors – especially retail investors new to the cryptocurrency space – it's easy to see how the 24-hour percent change convention could be confusing.  If you're new to trading, you may want to check your charts twice.  Trading chart image via Shutterstock.

42427641,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL2lNh,1501585530,Bitcoin UASF Proposal Quietly Activates – to Little Effect,"A controversial scaling proposal activated on bitcoin last night, though it happened quietly.  Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 148, the much-discussed user-activated soft fork (UASF) activated at block 478,484 on the bitcoin blockchain, though its code changes were superceded by another proposal designed to disable it.  Sometimes branded as a protest effort, BIP 148 allowed bitcoin's node operators a way to show their displeasure with miners, who they believed were blocking popular code updates, who they argued should not have a say in such matters.  As such, BIP 148 emerged as perhaps the most controversial way for the network to enact Segregated Witness, one that while influential, never achieved widespread endorsement.  If things had gone differently, users, mining pools, and companies running the BIP 148 nodes would have started rejecting blocks that did not signal support for SegWit yesterday. There's a chance this would have caused bitcoin to split into two competing assets.  By now, however, fears of a sudden split by way of BIP 148 have been avoided. Thanks partly to a proposal known as BIP 91, bitcoin mining pools were able to rally together before August 1 by locking in SegWit for activation. UASF supporters often argue that mining pools were incentivized to signal for SegWit because they wanted to avoid the activation of BIP 148 for more political reasons.  In this way, BIP 148's activation importance is arguably more symbolic, marking the avoidance of a split. On the other hand, a miner-activated hard fork (MAHF) that will fork bitcoin is scheduled for later today.

First filed in February 2016, the details of the three applications were made available to the public last week by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.  One case  cites a process for using a blockchain to track and validate user identification. For example, the document details how a distributed database system would be able to update a new user's identification information, and subsequently store and timestamp additional details as time progresses. Data such as ""signatures, physical attributes, or locations of the user are identified,"" the application says.  Authentication questions would then be generated based on a timeline, which could also be deployed by a third-party service to enable access for users.  A second patent application advances a design that enables the validation of changes to user identity, allowing the system to update and evolve that information over time.  Concurrently, a more generic patent application was also filed, which, as detailed by the document, is designed to convert unsecured ""instruments"" through a validation process.  In sum, the applications suggest the US-based bank is looking to blockchain as a way to validate not only the people who are using a system, but also the information within it as well.  To date, Bank of America has been among the more active companies in applying for patents related to blockchain technology, filing for 10 in late 2015.

42427639,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL2lJh,1501574407,Bitcoin Cash: Who Supports the Fork And Who Doesn't,"The bitcoin blockchain may be just hours away from its first major fork.  While the technical maneuver (explained in more detail here) doesn't impact bitcoin itself, if implemented it will result in the creation of a competing cryptocurrency, Bitcoin Cash, with a similar transaction history.  That said, Bitcoin Cash intends to activate new rules that are at odds with the bitcoin network, aiming to boost transaction capacity by increasing the block size to 8MB and removing Segregated Witness (SegWit), a long-debated code optimization that's likely to activate on bitcoin later in August.  Warranted or not, some have been making a pretty big deal out of Bitcoin Cash's launch.  But, just like every other cryptocurrency, the success of Bitcoin Cash hinges on how much support it gets from users, businesses and miners. And, so far, it might not have much.  While it certainly has passionate supporters who disagree with bitcoin's technical direction, Bitcoin Cash is trading at about one-tenth of bitcoin's price on an available futures market.  And, so far, out of more than 20 mining pools, only one, ViaBTC, has said that it is giving miners that are a part of the pool the option of pointing their computing power toward the securing the cryptocurrency.  Elsewhere, it seems positions on and opinions of the project are still developing in real time.  Bitcoin Cash supporters  So, what do we know about supporters so far?  For one, Bitcoin Cash supporters often overlap with the members of bitcoin's scaling debate who have historically supported a bigger block size parameter.  Take for instance Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Classic, and Bitcoin Unlimited: a few alternative bitcoin softwares that tried to enact similar changes but never got off the ground. Many of the developers who worked on those projects now support Bitcoin Cash. In fact, some are working on compatible software implementations.  Then there are various entrepreneurs, researchers and users who support the ideas behind it.  ""SegWit doesn't solve the problem we have right now which is an urgent need for on-chain scaling,"" said Yours CEO Ryan X. Charles, who supports Bitcoin Cash's technical roadmap.  Like Charles, some companies and users are backing the idea because they just want bitcoin to be easier and cheaper to use. They argue that an immediate block size parameter increase would go a long way toward achieving that.  ""As far as how many support it, I'm not sure, but I'm pretty sure the silent majority wants lower fees,"" he added.  The average fee for a transaction, at time of publication, was more than a dollar, down from nearly $5 last quarter.  Bitcoin Cash vs. Segwit2x  Still, since Bitcoin Cash is trying to push a niche combination of scaling technologies, even some who support a bigger block size don't back the effort.  ShapeShift CEO Erik Voorhees is one, and DCG founder and CEO Barry Silbert, who played a big part in coordinating a technical roadmap called Segwit2x, is another.  That's partly because many companies and mining pools still intend to support the Segwit2x ""agreement,"" another controversial scaling proposal that attracted the support of bigger bitcoin startups and mining pools representing 80% of the network’s computing power.  The obvious difference between Segwit2x and Bitcoin Cash is that Segwit2x doesn't intend to drop support for SegWit.  In this light, some see Bitcoin Cash as a possible backup plan if Segwit2x goes awry before the block size parameter increase expected in three months. (Although, that particular hard fork is quite controversial as well.)  While aligned with ViaBTC, one of Bitcoin Cash's biggest supporters, on some other issues, mining pool Bitcoin.com and mining firm Bitmain both also said they will continue to stand behind Segwit2x for the time being.  In that way, Bitcoin Cash might attract more support in the future if the Segwit2x scaling proposal fails to boost the block size parameter.  Bitcoin Cash critics  Segwit2x supporters and mining pools are not the only users who aren't interested in moving to the new cryptocurrency, and are skeptical that Bitcoin Cash will attract enough users to ""breathe new life into bitcoin,"" as the project website advertises.  While some alternative cryptocurrencies, such as ethereum and ripple, have been successful, most other competing cryptocurrencies haven’t achieved bitcoin’s level of popularity. Critics, arguably with history on their side, contend that Bitcoin Cash faces the same problems as this class of assets.  In that context of the thousands of available cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin Core contributor Bryan Bishop called Bitcoin Cash a ""total headache"" and ""overwhelmingly boring.""  ""It's easy to make spin-offs,"" he said. ""What's hard is protecting and growing bitcoin's value in backwards-compatible ways that benefit the entire ecosystem.""  Bishop went on to question why Bitcoin Cash developers chose the date August 1, since a group behind another controversial scaling proposal, BIP 148, was scheduled for the same date.  ""By choosing a conflicting date, I think the unfortunate outcome is increased confusion for bitcoin users,"" he said.  Still, bitcoin's value is that it's a decentralized online currency.  So, even Bitcoin Cash critics such as Bishop applaud that users can create their own cryptocurrency if they don't like a particular technical feature.  Bishop concluded:  ""If the cash proponents want to stop using the current bitcoin protocol, they are certainly welcome to, even if I wouldn't recommend it.""

42427642,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL2lPh,1501554313,Bitcoin Fork Watch: News & Guides for the Coming Bitcoin Cash Split,"The bitcoin protocol could see its first major fork on August 1.  That's when, if miners stand by their word, the network will see the creation of Bitcoin Cash – a new cryptocurrency backed by a version of the blockchain that boasts a unique technical roadmap.  Not only will Bitcoin Cash tweak the protocol to increase the block size, but it will reject code proposed by bitcoin's developers that would seek to improve scalability and reduce the necessity of this metric in achieving capacity in the future.  But while at odds with the businesses and developers that have largely embraced the Segwit2x proposal (or SegWit itself), supporters have high expectations for the project, which they've largely cloaked in terminology that suggests it will mark a return to the project's roots.  ""Ninety years ago, the same day, there was a revolution in China. Now today we have another revolution,"" said one excited supporter in a project WeChat group.  Said another:  ""The dream of a peer-to-peer digital cash for all the people restarts in a few hours.""  Lofty ambitions aside, the bitcoin fork could end up impacting users and businesses, increasing market volatility and leading to consumer and media confusion.
