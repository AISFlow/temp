42402119,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3VE3,1541544909,Bitcoin Cash Price Climbs 11% to Hit 2-Month High,"The price of bitcoin cash rose more than 11 percent on Tuesday, pushing its price to a new two-month high.  Market data shows that the cryptocurrency's price has risen 30 percent since Sunday, and is currently trading at roughly $623. Bitcoin cash is the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, CoinMarketCap data shows.  The price of BCH was trading hands at $425 before surging 32.5 percent, where it reached a then-peak of $588 on Nov. 5, clocking a 5-week high in the process when it was later confirmed, according to Coinbase exchange data.  The market developments come as bitcoin cash prepares for a hard fork – or backward-incompatible code change – on November 15, this time involving two different implementations: Bitcoin ABC and Bitcoin SV. The cryptocurrency was originally created by way of a hard fork off of the original bitcoin network after the scaling debate boiled over last year.        BCH's price boost makes it one of the top-performing cryptocurrencies of the day, based on information from crypto-data sources OnChainFX and CoinMarketCap.  Other top performers for Tuesday include XRP, which hit a one-month high earlier in the day (it has since risen above $0.50 apiece as of press time) and Stellar lumens, which has climbed more than 8 percent in the past 24 hours. On Tuesday, wallet service provider Blockchain announced that it would give away $125 million in XLM as part of an airdrop for its customer base.  As of the time of writing, the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies is up more than $6 billion on a 24-hour basis, reaching a 22-day high of roughly $218 billion.

42402114,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3V98,1541539815,Texas Regulators Enter Emergency Stop Against Crypto Mining Firm,"The Texas State Securities Board entered an emergency cease-and-desist on Tuesday against a cloud mining company based in Australia that it said was selling unregistered securities.  In the order, Texas securities regulators claim that Automated Web Services Mining (otherwise known as AWS Mining), AWS Mining PTY LTD., a number of of AWS Mining's officers, crypto wallet provider MyCoinDeal, and multi-level marketing organization AWS Elite were violating the state's Securities Act and committing fraud by selling investment contracts in AWS' cloud mining pool.  According to the filing, the respondents promised investors a 200 percent return on any purchases made, using a multi-level marketing organization to sell mining power contracts.  However, after investors signed on, the company downplayed the profit they would see, the document said. It explained:  ""Although potential investors are led to believe they will receive a 200 [percent] return on principal invested in crypto mining power contracts, Respondent AWS Mining is now disclaiming the guarantee of profitability and instead representing that investors assume the risks associated with the investment.""  Further, investors were required to use a crypto wallet created by MyCoinDeal, which charged a fee for any transactions that users conducted.  These fees include a 2 percent charge for all fiat deposits, 2 percent for fiat withdrawals, and anywhere from 0.5 to 1 percent for trading cryptocurrencies.  Overall, the companies failed to register as dealers or agents for securities offerings and similarly did not register its contracts as securities, according to the document. The respondents also mislead investors and essentially committed fraud.  Because ""respondents' conduct, acts and practices threaten immediate and irreparable harm,"" the document orders all respondents to immediately cease selling any securities in Texas, as well as engaging in any potentially fraudulent or otherwise misleading activities.  AWS Mining and its affiliated parties have 31 days to request a hearing on the charges. If the companies fail to do so, the emergency cease-and-desist will become a final one.  AWS Mining did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

42402115,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3VA7,1541533600,Charlie Shrem Says He Never Owned Bitcoin Claimed Stolen By Winklevosses,"Early bitcoin entrepreneur Charlie Shrem is pushing back against an accusation that he stole 5,000 bitcoin from Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, according to recently-published court filings.  In a document filed Monday with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Shrem calls the Winklevoss brothers' assertion that he stole 5,000 bitcoin ""dead wrong,"" while also arguing against a prejudgement motion to freeze certain of his assets.  The Winklevoss brothers sued Shrem in September, though the complaint remained under seal until October, claiming that while they paid him $1 million to purchase bitcoin on their behalf in September 2012, he failed to deliver 5,000 coins, instead keeping them for himself. At press time, they would be worth approximately $32 million.  In Monday's filing, he claims that 5,000 bitcoin in a wallet affiliated with him belonged to another individual whom he assisted, and that he, at no point, had access to the bitcoin.  In a separate affidavit, Shrem says he helped this individual (whose name was redacted, with a note stating that an unredacted version remains under seal) transfer 5,000 bitcoin into a cold storage wallet in 2012.  Shrem goes on to state that he ""never moved those bitcoin again.""  He added that he did not have access to the coins afterward, either. As such, he claims he ""never personally owned the 5,000 bitcoins discussed above, nor have I ever personally owned 5,000 bitcoins all at one time.""  Addressing the part of the Winklevoss brothers' complaint stating he spent bitcoin to purchase new cars, boats and a $2 million property, Shrem added:  ""After I was released from prison, I had a net worth of less than $100,000 and worked for approximately six months at a restaurant in Pennsylvania. Since working at the restaurant, I have worked a variety of jobs that have allowed me to accumulate funds and to restore myself financially.""  To support his claim, Shrem attached a pair of printouts of transactions as logged by Blockchain, showing that 5,000 bitcoin were moved twice on Dec. 31, 2012, into and later, out of a wallet associated with Shrem. Another redacted document includes emails explaining these transactions.  He also claims that despite suggestions to the contrary, he has paid part of the $950,000 he owes federal authorities as part of his 2014 guilty plea deal for running an unlicensed money-transmitting business.  Opposing the prejudgement freezing of some of his assets, Shrem further claimed that Winklevoss Capital Fund, the entity named in the plaintiffs' side of the lawsuit, fails to prove either that the overall suit would succeed or that Shrem actively sought to defraud the plaintiffs.  Tyler Winklevoss, Cameron Winklevoss and the Winklevoss Capital Fund did not immediately respond to a request for comment. An attorney for Shrem declined to comment.

The crypto hardware manufacturing giant announced Tuesday that the new Antminer S15 and T15 machines will be powered by its recently revealed 7nm ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) processor, and will go on sale on Nov. 8.  The new miners ""possess industry-leading hash rates designed to mine with the SHA256 algorithm,"" according to a tweet from the company.  The 7nm chip was first announced in late September by Bitmain CEO and co-founder Jihan Wu, who said it would be more energy efficient and powerful than older models.  While specs for the chip haven't yet been released in full, Wu said during his original announcement that it would include ""more than a billion transistors"" and ""achieve a ratio of energy consumption to mining capacity that its as low as 42J/TH.""  Details on the new Antminers are also sparse, with a holding page on the company's website offering no information at press time.  Bitmain's announcement comes amid its push to raise funds via an initial public offering. The company officially filed for an IPO at the end of September, although pitch decks obtained by CoinDesk indicate some investors may have seen false information regarding the company's funding status.  Funding attempts aside, the company's new processor will compete with a number of other bitcoin-focused ASICs, including a new 14nm chip announced the day before by Bitfury. Dubbed the Bitfury Clarke, the company's latest product similarly claims to boost power efficiency specifically for the SHA256 algorithm as used by cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.  In related news, Bitfury revealed earlier today that it's just closed an $80 million funding round that saw Mike Novogratz's Galaxy Digital investing.

42402120,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3VHz,1541519127,The Number of Bitcoin Short Positions Just Hit a 3-Month Low,"The bearish sentiment around bitcoin sank to three-month lows earlier today as short positions placed on crypto exchange Bitfinex fell to their lowest level since August 5th.  At approximately 11:00 UTC, the number of short positions dropped to 21,434, which represents a 33 percent drop in the past eight days alone. During the same time, longs – or positions that are betting on an increase in bitcoin's price – also witnessed a notable increase of 10 percent, the current number of which (24,410) marks a three-week high.  Indeed, the sentiment here seems to be shifting in favor of the bulls. The price of bitcoin broke bearish from a historically tight, two-week range of just $139 on Oct. 29, yet sellers were not able to further capitalize on the bearish outcome.  As a result, the price of bitcoin has risen roughly 4 percent since then to return to the range and negate the technically bearish view in the short term.  What's more, bitcoin bulls have market seasonality on their side. The fourth quarter of the fiscal year is traditionally bullish for bitcoin prices, specifically the month of November. Data reveals that bitcoin has only concluded November with a monthly percent loss once since 2010, in 2011.  Looking at the chart below, it's perhaps no coincidence that shorts began their more-than-30 percent drop just a day before November began.  BTC/USD Longs, Shorts, and Price  When a short or long trade becomes overcrowded, it tends to represent overbought or oversold market conditions. For example, a short squeeze, or rapid price increase occurs when an abundance of shorts are forced to cover in order to avoid a losing trading.  The same can occur for longs, too. If there are an abundance of longs and price begins to fall, those longing will likely need to close their trade and as result drive the price of the underlying asset lower and faster.  Although BTC shorts have taken a hit as of late, an abundance of longs has yet to pile up. Data shows only 53 percent of the leverage positions on Bitfinex are longs, meaning 47 percent are shorts.  The relatively even ratio shows longs are not yet an overwhelming favorite, but it's worth keeping in mind that the higher the percentage of longs, the more likely the price of bitcoin is to experience a pullback in the near term due to the overbought market conditions it would create, as was witnessed at the beginning of September.

Announced today, U.K.-based Barclays is among the global banks participating in the test, while the other 14 were not named. Together they will be kicking the tires of DTCC's distributed ledger and cloud-based platform for its credit derivatives Trade Information Warehouse (TIW).  Upon successful completion, DTCC expects to move to an ""open"" testing phase by the end of the year, it said in a statement. At that time other market participants and service providers will have the opportunity to test. Testing is anticipated to be completed by the first quarter of 2019 with go-live scheduled thereafter.  Building a new platform for TIW is one of the most ambitious enterprise blockchain projects in existence since the current system is a critical piece of infrastructure to the global financial industry. TIW provides lifecycle event processing services for roughly 98% of all credit derivative transactions worldwide, worth $11 trillion. The warehouse's customer base includes major global derivatives dealers and more than 2,500 buy-side firms and other market participants in over 70 countries.  Notably, the DTCC is sticking to its early 2019 go-live date, announced at Consensus 2018 in May.  ""We are pleased to be working with DTCC, our partners and colleagues on this exciting project to bring distributed ledger technology to life in a demonstrable way that will enhance efficiencies and lower costs and risks for the industry,"" said Lee Braine from the Investment Bank CTO Office at Barclays, in a statement.  New faces  DTCC has taken an unusual multi-vendor approach when it comes to distributed ledger technology (DLT), with IBM providing program management and integration services, Axoni building the DLT and smart contracts functionality on the AxCore blockchain protocol, and R3 acting as a solution advisor.  The testing phase is also pulling in other key financial infrastructure providers such as IHS Markit's new TradeServ platform which aims to deliver foreign exchange options and re-architectured credit matching and confirmations, tentatively scheduled to go live in the second quarter of next year.  The TIW serves as the golden record for the parties involved in credit derivatives trades, performing lifecycle events, payment calculations and settlement.  It tracks everything from initiation of a trade to maturity, including, amendments, modifications, rate resets, termination, and corporate actions – all of which is to be automated using Axoni's smart contract technology.  Additionally, the TIW includes cleared derivative positions from ICE, the Japan Securities Clearing Corporation (JSCC) and LCH SA's CDSClear.

The decentralized betting platform built on ethereum enjoyed a promising launch in July but then stagnated due to its clunky user experience and a general decline in the use of decentralized applications. As Tuesday's mid-term elections in the U.S. approach, however, money is pouring into the platform.  The market for ""Which party will control the House after 2018 U.S. Midterm Election?"" has 3,517 ether or nearly $727,000 staked on it at the time of writing, according to Predictions.Global, a website allowing users to view and search for Augur markets.  The market has surpassed ""Will price of Ethereum exceed $500 at the end of 2018?"" – for months the market with the most open interest by a wide margin, with $523,000 staked at the time of writing. The mid-terms market is also the most liquid on the platform, according to Predictions.Global, with target liquidity over 250 ether.  The rush of funds into the mid-terms market – which gives the Democrats a 66 percent chance of taking the House, compared to an 88 percent chance on FiveThirtyEight's poll-based model – has pushed the total dollar amount staked on Augur to a new record: nearly $2.1 million.  It should be noted, though, that Augur's open interest in ether terms (currently 10,134 ether) has been rising consistently. It was only due to ether's declining exchange rate that dollar-denominated open interest did not exceed its July high until the end of October, as data compiled by the Twitter user ""defroi"" shows:  As another chart defroi produced for CoinDesk shows, the increase in total open interest on the platform is due almost exclusively to the House prediction market, which began to surge on Oct. 22:  Augur's languid daily user numbers, however, have not noticeably taken off. According to DappRadar, they range from 19 to 56 users per day in October. The all-time high, hit the day of the platform's launch, is 256.  Even so, according to Predictions.Global co-founder Ryan Berckmans, the growth of the midterms market augurs well for the platform. ""It used to be very concentrated"" in the market for ether's year-end price, he said. ""That's still a big market, but the diversification into different verticals is a very good sign.""

42402122,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3VH0,1541503217,This Bitcoin Price Chart May Give Early Warning of Next Bull Reversal,"That bitcoin (BTC) has likely found a bottom around $6,000 is now generally accepted, so the challenge for investors and traders is to spot the early signs of a long-awaited bullish reversal.  Basic technical theory suggests that a bearish-to-bullish trend change is confirmed after the price invalidates a ""lower highs"" pattern – a series of descending peaks. As such, bitcoin needs to rise above the September high of $7,400 to confirm a major bullish breakout.  That would mean the number one cryptocurrency by market cap needs to rally close to 16 percent from the current price of $6,400 before the bulls can claim victory over the bears.  Seasoned traders, however, are always on the lookout for patterns that might allow them to front-run an impending textbook bullish reversal.  In bitcoin's case, the 3-day chart – on which each candlestick represents price action over a 72-hour period – is signaling that the prospects of bullish reversal would rise sharply if prices can clear the former support-turned-resistance of the 50-candle simple moving average (SMA).  As of writing, BTC is trading at $6,420 on Coinbase, representing a 0.5 percent drop in a 24-hour basis.  3-day chart  The 50-candle SMA marked on the chart served as a strong support, or buying level, during the entire rally from October 2015 to December 2017.  The SMA support became resistance in February after prices had dropped, and stayed in that role over the months since.  Notably, the recent lower price high of $7,400 was created at the SMA hurdle, so a break above that resistance could be considered an early sign of bullish reversal.  It's worth noting that BTC's bullish break above the 50-candle SMA in July ended up trapping the bulls on the wrong side of the market.  Even so, the failed breakout was likely a result of the investor disappointment following the US Securities and Exchange Commission's rejection of bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) at the time.  Looking ahead, BTC is unlikely to trap the bulls this time round, as the majority of bad news has been priced in.  View  The outlook as per the 3-day chart remains bearish as long as prices are trading below the 50-candle SMA of $6,642.  A break above $6,642 would mark the beginning of the long-awaited bullish reversal.  A move above $7,400 (September high) would signal a completion of bullish breakout.

42429919,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM2BDh,1541481346,PwC Is Advising (Not Auditing) Another Stablecoin Project,"The Hong Kong division of global accounting and consulting firm PwC is exploring the best practices for issuing stablecoins, as part of an initiative with the non-profit Loopring Foundation.  Announced Tuesday, PwC Hong Kong's Asia-focused study on stablecoins follows a PwC partnership in the U.S. to advise decentralized lending platform Cred, which is working on a U.S. dollar-tied coin.  Stablecoins or one sort or another are suddenly all the rage, with the likes of Circle issuing its dollar-backed USDC on exchange giant Coinbase, and even big players like IBM getting in on the act.  In addition, the current fervor for price-stable crypto coins seems to have coincided with something of a meltdown involving Tether, the issuer of the USDT stablecoin, following long-festering doubts about its dollar reserves.  ""There's a need for enhanced trust,"" William Gee, PwC's risk assurance emerging technology leader for China and Hong Hong, PwC told CoinDesk. ""So we are asking how things would look inside a regulated context; what are the standards, protocols, best practices and how would they fit?""  The Loopring Foundation, which drives decentralized exchange protocols, said PwC's involvement will help with its own drive for transparency around the creation and management of stablecoins and securities token offerings.  ""The level of security and auditablity empowered by the Loopring Protocol will play an essential role in regtech applications,"" Daniel Wang, founder of Loopring Foundation said in a statement.  Audit? Not so simple  Stepping back, a continuing interest in this area from a firm like PwC seems to raise the question, wouldn't third-party audits of stablecoins carried out by Big Four accountancy companies be the next logical step?  ""We are obviously looking at this area. So are all the major firms. I would say even beyond the Big Four,"" said Gee, who pointed out the PwC has been appointed as auditor of Tezos, an early blockchain ICO bonanza which experienced its own bumpy ride since fundraising.  But regarding stablecoins in particular, an absence of recognized standards or even a baseline regulatory approach means we are currently looking at ""a very diverse scenario,"" said Gee, adding:  ""This may look like a very simple ask from the crypto community, but auditors are in the public trust business, operating under a very robust set of standards, so it's not a simple question that we can actually give an answer to overnight.""  Indeed, Cameron Winklevoss, co-founder and president of the Gemini Trust Company, which recently launched the Gemini Dollar (GUSD) stablecoin, has made a similar point.  ""There is no financial report framework w/r/t to audit conformity w/ a stabelcoin,"" Winklevoss tweeted last month. ""So you can't perform an 'audit.' You must instead rely on a 3rd party to attest to whether an assertion (that there is a 1:1 peg) is accurate.""  Tether, which parted ways with accounting firm Friedman LLP this year before it could produce a full audit of its reserves, has likewise claimed that an audit for a business like its own is not available in the marketplace.  For stablecoins to be audited, Gee said, several things would have to be addressed, first among them compliance with know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money-laundering (AML) regulations.  Another central aspect is how the entire issuance and redemption cycle is handled plus its mechanism and controls. Then there is the custody and safekeeping technology, Gee said, concluding:  ""It's not just looking at the $10 million or $10 billion in your accounts. It involves looking at the entire operation: the entry and exit and all the controls surrounding them.""
