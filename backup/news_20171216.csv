42380137,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MEir,1513435510,"Bitcoin Takes All? Enterprise Blockchains Need Time, Too","Marc Hochstein is the managing editor of CoinDesk and the former editor-in-chief of American Banker. The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.      Last week I described how bitcoin, as a deflationary currency, encourages delayed gratification. Now there's evidence that bitcoin's straight-laced twin, enterprise blockchain technology, requires such an attitude as well.  Overshadowed by the bitcoin price action, the enterprise use case – and one of its most prominent evangelists – scored a major advance last week. But it was a hard-won victory.  After two years of exploration, the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) decided to replace its decades-old post-trade settlement system with a distributed ledger from Digital Asset, the startup led by former JPMorgan Chase executive Blythe Masters.  That's right, replace. This is not another pilot or a proof of concept or a sandbox, it's real production.  Masters called the agreement ""precedent-setting,"" and it'll be interesting to see what else her company does with its $115 million war chest after this prolonged and successful courtship.  But the achievement is all the more impressive considering that the ASX was publicly skeptical about the technology throughout the testing process.  Plan B  So skeptical that the exchange had a contingency plan in place, in case it decided Digital Asset’s technology wasn’t suitable.  It probably didn’t help that just months after the partnership with DA was announced, the ASX CEO who had championed blockchain resigned (even though the exchange quickly reaffirmed its commitment to exploring the tech’s possibilities.)  And it almost certainly didn’t help when, about a year into the process, stakeholders started to express disillusionment about blockchain in the Australian financial press.  Despite all these hurdles, Masters’ team won over the ASX.  ""We believe that using DLT ... will enable our customers to develop new services and reduce their costs, and it will put Australia at the forefront of innovation in financial markets,"" Dominic Stevens, managing director and CEO of the ASX, said in announcing the final decision.  Believe. That’s a strong word, one you hear often in bitcoin, but seldom in enterprise blockchain.  Too big to bungle  And perhaps rightly so.  Financial market infrastructure is, to use the parlance of regulators, ""systemically important"" – too big and too interconnected with the rest of the economy to bet on a buzzword. The careful, deliberate approach ASX took with DA before closing the deal last week was appropriate. If anything, it’s remarkable it took only two years to get this far.  But that, in turn, means others watching and participating in the space are going to have to exercise patience as well. This is not the kind of technology where you can ""move fast and break things,"" as Facebook famously encourages its employees to do.  Bitcoin’s resurgence this year has embarrassed the know-it-alls who wrote it off two years ago, confidently declaring that the blockchain, not the currency, would take off.  But DA’s big win shows it was also premature to declare commercial blockchains over, as many bitcoiners were understandably tempted to do this year.

42380146,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MEuB,1513432805,A Hitchhiker's Guide to the Blockchain Highway,"A video blogger and content creator better known as ""Mike in Space,"" (@mikeinspace) is the writer-director of the ""Bitcoin Car Talk"" YouTube series.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review.      Hello, Bitcoiner – Go ahead and help yourself into the back of the car.  Don't mind the mess, just push that stuff over, and make yourself comfortable. You hungry? I’ve got an extra steak cooking on the engine block. It should be ready any minute now! I should tell you, I don't usually pick up hitchhikers, but, well you look like you could use some help.  A lot of people come through this car. You can see bits and pieces of what they've left behind in the back there. That's an Opendime you just sat on. Oh, and that? That's the 21 Computer. Just push that aside for now...  I picked you up because of that sign you were holding. ""Heading south, will work for crypto.""  That's a common message these days – you're not the first to think of it. Hell, maybe you saw someone else holding that sign and thought you'd do the same. I see a lot of that too. The trick to a good sign is to make it relatable. Lots of people are heading south. Hell, lots of people even want crypto these days. Your message stuck. Simple messages are often the ones that stick best.  Look kid, I'll be straight with you. I'm a busy guy. I have a wife at home. I have kids to feed. But these people on the road these days? They're bonkers. I only picked you up because you looked... relatable. I made note of that. Yeah. You looked like you have the same problems I've had. Your sign stuck out. Signs like yours are what help like-minded people stick together.  So, what else makes a sign stick?  Well, you have to make your message snappy. That's the first thing.  You see all these cars? Each one of them contains a busy person on the go. These people don't have much time to think. They want to learn something, and they want to learn fast. So, make your message simple. And you know what? Make it funny too. People love to laugh.  Most people are just trying to get to where they're going. We don't have time to go down every road and examine them for ourselves. See, take those people on that side of the road. They're going backwards. You know it, and I know it. They'll learn that eventually. The reason they're going backwards is that they started off reading the wrong signs. Once you get started on the wrong trail, it's hard to turn around.  As for these people on our side of the road? Well, they're people like us. And they're heading our way. The biggest problem on these highways, best that I can tell is that no one's looking out for each other. Everyone is so concerned with their destination, they don't even pay attention to the people heading there with them.  That's why I picked you up. I figured, I need to talk to more people like us. People who stare into the same far-off distance I'm driving to, and who say, ""Damnit, I want to get there as well.""  So, where are we going?  Well, that's the hard part. I'm just heading forward right now. I don't know where you're going to. And sure, I could ask. But what if I don't like your answer? To me, all I need to know is that we're together for the time being. I'll take you as far as I'm going, and when I need to exit this highway, well, I'll just let the next guy take you from there.  That's what I like about a good sign. It takes you forward.  A great commute is made of simple steps. That's what all the great signs have in common. They cut through the big thinking and get straight to the heart of things. They help us focus on the immediate goals.  That's another thing about signs. When they're done right, they're lessons learned from others. Hints from our future selves, to our past. Some signs are great at finding our flaws. Others for finding our ideals. And some, well, they're just for blowing off pressure.  The trick is to remember the scenery is what makes road trips fun. If you don't like a sign, ignore it. That's why they put a steering wheel on this ride. It's up to you to pick what signs to follow.  You have to watch out for new people bearing fancy signs. Things get awfully heated when they show up. They can be distracting. People start rubbernecking down the highway. Accidents happen. People just can't seem to leave well-enough alone sometimes.  I think that's what decentralization is for. Making signs together. A way to direct traffic to your fruit stand on the side of the road. A way to tell others about the scenery at the top of the mountain. And sometimes, signs are even just a way to strip travelers of their money, in exchange for a peek at the world's largest pistachio.  And with that, I'm going to let you off.  This is my exit coming up, and I don't want to be late for my next gig. Watch out for that 21 computer there on your way out. Don't squish it. A man walked in here with that a couple years ago, and well, he got restless, too. Left that behind on his way out. All he had to do was sit still and not bother anyone. But he was so in a hurry to change the world that he ended up changing nothing.  Thanks for the attention bub. Good luck on the rest of your trip, and watch out for tourist traps. The world's largest pistachio ain't no good if you can't fit it down your throat.  Not in for the ride? CoinDesk is looking for submissions to its 2017 in Review series.
