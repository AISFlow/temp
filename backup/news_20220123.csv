As of press time, bitcoin (BTC) was changing hands just below $35,000, up 1.6% over the past 24 hours. More than $1.5 billion of bitcoin trading positions were liquidated over the past three days due to margin calls, according to the data site Coinglass.  The bitcoin price is down 19% in the past seven days – the cryptocurrency's worst weekly performance since May 2021, when fears of China's renewed crackdown on cryptocurrency trading and mining sent the market reeling, and tweets by Tesla CEO Elon Musk focused public attention on the Bitcoin blockchain network's potential environmental harms.  This time around, crypto traders appear to be pricing in fears the U.S. Federal Reserve will move quickly over the next few months to tighten monetary conditions that have been at historically loose levels since the coronavirus struck the economy in March 2020. The Fed's stimulus – including trillions of dollars of money printing – were widely cited as a reason for bitcoin's price gains in 2020 and 2021, including the ascent to an all-time high price of $69,000 in November.  The latest shakeout left bitcoin down by roughly half from that record price, a stark reminder of just how volatile cryptocurrency markets can be.  ""One of the bullish drivers for crypto over the last two years has been the surplus of pandemic-related fiscal and monetary stimulus globally, and much of that is coming to an end,"" David Duong, head of institutional research for the big U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, wrote Saturday in a report.  Bitcoin crash  The price plunge over the past week looks ""emotionally charged,"" according to Katie Stockton, founder of the analysis firm Fairlead Strategies.  ""Because shakeouts are common, we would await confirmation of a breakdown below cloud-based support (~$37.4K) before taking a bearish long-term stance,"" Stockton wrote.  El Salvador President Nayib Bukele tweeted late Friday that the bitcoin-friendly country took advantage of the price drop to buy 410 BTC for about $15 million, adding that ""some guys are selling really cheap.""  The bitcoin price hasn't been this low since July 2021.

42411528,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOjuA,1642956600,"No, Tech Stocks Aren’t Driving Crypto Prices","Crypto prices were crushed this past week and when such events happen, many seek out a culprit.  We’ve been noting that demand for bitcoin and ether was drying up (“Of course, this doesn’t mean muted markets can last forever, but in the coming days or weeks, one shouldn’t be surprised if prices drift south,” I warned in last week’s column). That answered the question “what?” but not “why?”  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Sunday.  One persistent, common myth about crypto may seem perfectly reasonable but doesn’t hold up when the data is analyzed. That myth is that cryptocurrencies trade closely with tech stocks and certainly more so than with the overall market.  With a selloff in tech giants coinciding with bitcoin’s plunge this past week, this theory is gaining traction.  At first blush, there’s a lot of reasons why that would make sense. Buying cryptocurrencies – not just bitcoin, but any of them – is a bet that the technology will be adopted by more users. Something that is the future of money (and art and data management and …) that has fewer than 40 million non-zero balances as bitcoin does will only go up from there, since the world’s population is 198 times that amount, the thinking goes.  Thus, one would expect the new technology narrative to far outweigh the inflation hedge narrative, which is an integral part of bitcoin's origin story. Yet is that really the case?  The data says … not exactly.  The favored proxy for the tech sector, the Nasdaq 100, is packed with giants in the space: Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta (aka Facebook), Tesla and Alphabet (aka Google), which accounted for 43% of the index’s value as of Dec. 31. And while there are other sectors like consumer services or healthcare, even those are tech-heavy. Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts and Netflix are categorized as “communication services,” for example.  Using bitcoin as a proxy for crypto overall – not perfect, but bear with me – we see the correlation coefficient between the largest cryptocurrency by market cap and the Nasdaq Composite (using a 90-day set) is 0.22. That’s positive, but weak.  Yet the narrative of bitcoin offsetting the devaluing dollar is even weaker than the one about it being a tech-related investment. The correlation coefficient between bitcoin and the U.S. Dollar Index is just -0.13. Against U.S. bonds, represented by the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT), it is just -0.02. In other words, no relationship at all.  All this is to say that there are likely other factors that can explain the current state of the crypto markets. For example, given the major moves in the past year have all tied with regulatory action in China, it’s hard not to see the connection between those events and bitcoin’s price path.  For the time being at least, one could say bitcoin’s prices are a combination of some global risk appetite and a lot of the market dynamics in China (and the aftermath of restrictions there). Those factors’ influences aren’t static, but they explain a lot more than watching the Fed’s every move.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Lawrence Lewitinn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/23/no-tech-stocks-arent-driving-crypto-prices,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1fa5247ff0008437b62077a56321782034eab2a6-1024x677.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411520,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOjTi,1642943700,Professor Gensler Gets an F on Crypto,"Crypto insiders lauded Gary Gensler’s nomination to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last February. They thought the Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor who had taught blockchain classes would bring an enlightened approach to crypto compared with the scattershot, perplexed style of his predecessor, Jay Clayton.  But a year in, the professor gets an F in crypto guidance and leadership. He has encouraged the worst bureaucratic instincts of the federal government, deepened regulatory confusion and thwarted any hope of progress during his tenure – all while claiming the mantle of little-guy defender and public-interest protector.  Paul H. Jossey is an adjunct fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute and founder of thecrowdfundinglawyers.com. Follow him on Twitter @thecrowdfundlaw.  Not everyone agrees with this assessment. The powerful, entrenched interests in Washington and beyond that oppose everything crypto are likely pleased with Gensler’s anti-crypto posture. These include certain Democratic senators, well-placed financial regulators and global central banking authorities.  Gensler compares his regulator role to that of football referees. “Imagine a football game without referees. Without fear of penalties, teams start to break rules. The game isn’t fair and maybe after a few minutes, it isn’t fun to watch,” he said. In reality, the referees are the only ones who know the rules. They won’t tell the teams what the rules are but still call a penalty on every play – the players discovering ex post facto the play was verboten.  Former acting Comptroller of the Currency Brian Brooks described the scene recently in congressional testimony: “What happens in the United States is you have a new crypto project and you walk into the SEC and you describe it in great detail and you ask for guidance and they say we can’t tell you and you list it at your own peril.”  This is particularly disheartening when the teams have plays the fans want to see. Although Gensler couches crypto edicts as protecting people against scams, many high-profile cases the SEC has prosecuted during his, and his predecessor’s, tenure had active, happy user bases. Kik, Telegram and ongoing cases against LBRY and XRP/Ripple alleged selling “unregistered” securities via a security type (investment contract) absent in the federal code and defined through a three-part test by the Supreme Court a year after World War II ended.  Lawyer James Burnham speculates the Supreme Court would likely strike down similar securities rules today, perhaps if a challenge was brought before it by a crypto company, without a congressional mandate. But even if a lawsuit reaches the high court, an agency reprimand would already have required a company to spend gargantuan legal fees and endure years of litigation before even the chance to argue the case.  This is a bet most are unwilling to make. The SEC is not unaware of its ability to bleed defiant companies dry and force settlements before they obtain meaningful judicial review. As it stated in its 2018 budget request: “[T]he SEC’s litigation efforts also help the SEC obtain strong settlements in other cases by providing a credible trial threat and making it clear that the SEC will go deep into litigation and to trial, if necessary, in order to obtain appropriate relief.”  See also: Gary Gensler's Insane Crypto Policy |Opinion  For his part, Gensler has directed the SEC Enforcement Division to discourage meetings with companies under investigation and eliminate “unnecessary process.”  Thus, the status quo is the worst of all worlds: rules that leave seasoned securities lawyers guessing, an agency that refuses any guidance besides lawsuits or threats thereof and an agency chairman requesting scores more enforcement attorneys and “plenary” authority to protect people who in many cases do not want it.  Does any of this serve the public interest?  Commissioner Hester Peirce described a previous era of “broken windows” theory compliance, where all alleged violations are prosecuted – no matter how negligible – at the SEC. She’s right, you might as well call it the “Sanctions and Enforcement” Commission.  Under Gensler, the SEC has declared a permanent crypto war. It has refused to approve any bitcoin spot exchange-traded products despite myriad applications, new projects are refused guidance and told to take their chances, and the chairman recently gave a speech one commentator called the “the most aggressive and hostile stance re U.S. crypto regulation to date from the SEC.”  An SEC this stroppy to crypto innovation may serve entrenched interests in Washington and other global financial destinations. Cynics suspect entrenched interests comprise Gensler’s real audience because they might help him ascend to Treasury Secretary or beyond. But an SEC antagonistic to crypto does nothing for the American public waiting to bet on new teams without the referees becoming the story.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Paul Jossey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/01/23/professor-gensler-gets-an-f-on-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1dfb0452ec26f3be0917191ea2625ac51b574e8b-720x406.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
