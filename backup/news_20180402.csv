42401386,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcbcdy,1522710005,"SEC Halts Mayweather-Endorsed ICO, Charges Founders With Fraud","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has halted an initial coin offering and charged its founders with ""orchestrating a fraudulent initial coin offering,"" the regulator said Monday night.  The agency said it charged Sohrab Sharma and Robert Farkas, the co-founders of Centra Tech, with fraud after they raised $32 million by selling ""unregistered securities.""  While the ICO startup claimed the funds would go toward developing financial products backed by Visa and Mastercard, the SEC said Centra had no relationship with either payment card network. The agency further stated that Sharma and Farkas created false marketing material, including fictional executives.  Notably, the SEC also alleges that the founders paid celebrities to promote the ICO. These celebrities appear to include boxing champion Floyd Mayweather, who endorsed Centra in September 2017, though his Instagram post has since been removed.  In a press release, SEC Division of Enforcement co-director Steve Peikin stated:  ""As we allege, the defendants relied heavily on celebrity endorsements and social media to market their scheme. Endorsements and glossy marketing materials are no substitute for the SEC’s registration and disclosure requirements as well as diligence by investors.""  Centra and its co-founders were also the targets of a class-action lawsuit filed in December 2017, which claimed that the startup's CTR token was essentially an unregistered security.  The SEC said both Sharma and Farkas were arrested and charged by law enforcement officers.

42401392,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcbcjs,1522701319,Google Bans Crypto Mining Browser Extensions,"Google has banned cryptocurrency mining browser extensions from the Chrome store.  The U.S. tech giant announced its decision on Monday, and said that in July it will start removing existing browser extensions that facilitate mining. Other blockchain-related extensions are still allowed.  Google previously permitted Chrome mining extensions as long as they were solely dedicated to mining and explicitly informed users of their purpose. But that policy wasn't enough to deter or keep out noncompliant add-ons.  Forum posts from The Chromium Projects – an open-source initiative started by Google to furnish source code for Chrome – show that developers have been concerned about mining extensions since last autumn.  According to Wired, Google decided to implement Monday's ban because the majority of mining extensions submitted to the Chrome Web Store failed to comply with its sole-usage policy.  ""The key to maintaining a healthy extensions ecosystem is to keep the platform open and flexible,"" James Wagner, Google's extensions platform product manager told Wired. ""This empowers our developers to build creative and innovative customizations for Chrome browser users."" He explained further:  ""This is why we chose to defer banning extensions with cryptomining scripts until it became clear that the vast majority of mining extensions submitted for review failed to comply with our single purpose policy or were malicious.""  The mining extension ban comes less than a month after Google announced its plans to ban cryptocurrency-related advertisements.  Clandestine cryptocurrency mining has become increasingly common in recent months, with governments and major companies alike suffering from attacks.  In February, for example, electric vehicle maker Tesla's cloud was compromised by mining malware. U.K. government websites were also exploited by mining malware around the same time.  In January, cybersecurity firm TrendMicro discovered that Google itself was a victim, and that its DoubleClick Ads were used to distribute crypto mining malware.

Therefore, we are now looking at how we can organize this service for them.""  The pilot program, if it happens, will be done through a Swiss subsidiary to take advantage of Switzerland's relatively permissive regulatory environment, he said.

Bitpay, which processes bitcoin and bitcoin cash payments for merchants, announced that it had launched a $30 million Series B funding round last December, but decided to expand the round before it had concluded. ATG led the round, which expanded to $40 million due to ""high demand,"" Bitpay CEO Stephen Pair told digital news organization Recode on Monday.  Tyler Sosin, a partner who is spearheading Menlo's crypto work, told Recode that the firm has been considering investments in various blockchain startups for the past 18 months, but was dissatisfied with its options until it found Bitpay. He did not disclose the sum Menlo contributed to the round.  Sosin said Menlo anticipates that the blockchain will be an essential part of future payment technologies, though the firm has not purchased any cryptocurrencies outright or participated in an initial coin offering (ICO).  According to Sosin, the firm decided to invest in Bitpay because as a payment platform, it would not require them to wager on the success of a particular cryptocurrency.  Bitpay may not be Menlo's only foray into the crypto industry. Sosin suggested that the firm, whose portfolio also includes investments in Uber, Tumblr and Roku, intends to increase its presence in the space, saying ""it's early, early days. We imagine there will be some very big companies.""

Mayor Park Won-soon announced the plan during an interview with CoinDesk Korea last week, where he also revealed that the city will create a fund to support the advancement of blockchain technology and related startups.  ""As Seoul is the world's leading city in the field of information and communications, including the Fourth Industrial Revolution, I think we should study new technologies such as blockchains,"" he said.  Like Estonia, which is attempting to apply blockchain technology to all government administrative processes, Park thinks that the ""blockchain can be applied to all bureaucratic administrations in Seoul, such as the public transport system system operated by Seoul City and the provision of youth allowance.""  Furthermore, Park indicated that the S-Coin could be used as a payment method for city-funded welfare programs for public employees, young job seekers and citizens helping the environment by saving electricity, water and gas.  To accomplish this, Park said the laws governing cryptocurrencies would need to be changed, adding that ""in order to make an S-Coin, we need to prepare institutional and legal support such as bylaws,"" he said.  Park also said he hopes to foster a blockchain ecosystem, saying:  ""I've met blockchain companies, and I think our companies are not seeing the light because of the various regulations. Actually, [the] technology is as advanced as any other country. By creating clusters that will allow blockchain companies to build up, and startups to develop new technologies, we are working to develop and spread blockchain technology around the world.""  Stepping back, this scheme is part of a wider blockchain masterplan for Seoul, which the city expects to complete in April. In November of 2017, the city of Seoul hired Samsung SDS to help it establish an information strategy plan (ISP) for blockchain-based municipal innovation. It is the first city in Korea to create a roadmap for introducing the blockchain.  Regarding the Korean government's strong regulatory policy on cryptocurrency, Park said, ""The last time the Ministry of Justice announced regulatory measures, there was tremendous resistance, and the government seemed to think deeply about it."" He added that it is ""the local government's task to create cases and models.""  If the Seoul government can relax certain regulations, it could become easier to pursue these models, he suggested.

That's the gist of a tweetstorm Monday from Vitalik Buterin, in which the ethereum creator said his proposal to create a hard cap on the supply of ether tokens was intended as an April Fool's ""meta-joke.""  While he said he originally just wanted to see people argue over the merits of fixing the supply, Buterin added that he now believes the idea is ""worth considering.""  Ethereum Improvement Proposal 960, published April 1, suggested that the ether supply be capped at 120,204,432 units, twice the amount originally sold in 2014. Addressing the cryptocurrency's presently unclear monetary policy, the proposal suggested that a hard cap would ""ensure the economic sustainability"" of ethereum.  It should not matter whether or not the proposal was written as a joke, Buterin said Monday on Twitter. Because ""the words actually were written in the github issue, and the arguments for it are real arguments,"" he said the suggestions are ""very real.""  He continued, saying:  ""If the community wants fixed supply and people believe that EIP 960 is a good way to achieve that, then it should adopt the proposal. If the community does not, then it should not. This is true regardless of whether or not the original intent was in jest.""  Buterin also said some 20 percent of his blog post announcing the EIP was plagiarized from the website of Tron, a digital entertainment blockchain startup.  Yet based on community feedback, Buterin said he ""now believes"" that developers should look at creating a hard cap. He listed some arguments in favor of the proposal, including that in the long run, ""inflationary tokens are a bad idea.""  Buterin concluded by saying that the ethereum community has progressed from waiting for the core developers to make every change to debating ideas regardless of who proposes them, but noted that ""there's still a long way to go.""

42428780,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLdwPh,1522677603,How Bad Was Q1? Just Two Top-Tier Cryptos Saw Gains,"The crypto markets had a rough ride in the first quarter of 2018, with just two tokens bucking the downtrend.  The buying frenzy seen at the turn of the year quickly ran out of steam in the first half of January, and what appeared to be a healthy pullback soon turned into a bear market on fears South Korea and China would announce deeper regulations.  South Korea, in particular, has been effective in curbing excessive speculation, as the so-called ""Kimchi Premium"" fell sharply following the new regulations. Further, trading volumes dropped sharply in February and March, which, according to many is a sign of normalization in the markets.  All told, the total value of all cryptocurrencies, which hit a record high of $830 billion in early January, fell close to 70 percent to $251 billion in the last week of March – the lowest level since Nov. 23, according to CoinMarketCap.  While most of the top 25 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization have seen losses since their January peaks, lesser-known binance coin (BNB) and VeChain's VET token have managed to etch out gains.  Q1 top losers  Bitcoin Gold  Quarterly performance: -83.00 percent  All-time high: $484.78  Closing price on Mar. 31: $44.34  Current market price: $42.73  Rank as per market capitalization: 23  Created via a hard fork in mid-November, bitcoin gold (BTG) topped out above $500 immediately after launch.  But, right off the bat, the investor community struggled to see the cryptocurrency's unique selling point and have largely ignored it. Hence, by the turn of the year, BTG was already down more than 40 percent from its record highs despite a broad-based crypto market rally.  The 83 percent drop seen in the first quarter of 2018 is hardly surprising, coming as it did amid the wider markets sell-off.  NEM  Quarterly performance: -78.74 percent  All-time high: $2.09  Closing price on Mar. 31: $0.221104  Current market price: $0.219834  Rank as per market capitalization: 15  NEM's XEM token was in the news for all the wrong reasons in the first quarter.  The token was involved in a huge cryptocurrency heist in January, which saw hackers steal about 500 million XEM tokens, worth roughly $430 million, from Japanese exchange Coincheck. The broader market sell-off did not help the matters, either. And rumors that NEM would serve as an underlying platform for Venezuela's petro cryptocurrency failed to put a bid under XEM prices.  Consequently, by the first week of March, NEM was down more than 85 percent from record highs set in early January. The token did witness a sort of revival on March 8, possibly due to reports that Coincheck would be compensating customers that lost money in the hack.  However, the token failed to take out resistance at the descending 50-day MA (moving average) on March 15, according to Poloniex data, and fell back below $0.22 on March 31.  Cardano  Quarterly performance: -78.31 percent  All-time high: $2.09  Closing price on Mar. 31: $0.221104  Current market price: $0.219834  Rank as per market capitalization: 15  Cardano (ADA) witnessed a head-and-shoulders breakdown on March 7 and fell to $0.1206 on Binance – the lowest level since Dec. 13.  In a tweet dated March 18, ADA Founder Charles Hoskinson blamed fears of regulatory crackdown, the activity of ""whales,"" thin markets (low volumes) and inexperienced retail investors for the sell-off in cryptos. A month earlier, Hoskinson has said that ADA will be better than bitcoin and ethereum, but his comments received a lukewarm response from investors.  Q1 top gainers  Binance Coin  Quarterly performance: +28.15 percent  All-time high: $22.48  Closing price on Mar. 31: $11.06  Current market price: $11.77  Rank as per market capitalization: 18  It's becoming more common for exchanges to issue their own cryptocurrencies, and that trend could accelerate given the performance of binance coin (BNB) this quarter.  The asset decoupled from the broader markets in mid-March after developers disclosed plans to launch ""Binance Chain"" – a decentralized exchange. As part of the plan, BNB is to be upgraded to exist on its own blockchain mainnet, becoming a native coin to Binance Chain – a move that is expected to increase the scope of the token.  The positive news flow, coupled with the minor bout of recovery in the crypto markets in the third week of March, pushed BNB to $15.17 on March 24 on Binance – the highest level since Jan. 21.  As of writing, the cryptocurrency is holding well above its 200-day moving average and could soon revisit its recent high of $15.17, technical studies indicate.  VeChain  Quarterly performance: +3.47 percent  All-time high: $9.45  Closing price on Mar. 31: $2.38  Current market price: $2.74  Rank as per market capitalization: 16  The first quarter turned out to be a good one for VeChain as it signed a deal with BMW, launched ""my story"" – an application aimed to help the wine industry address the problem of counterfeit products. Also, in March, the company also entered into a partnership with LogSafer – leading supply chain risk management and a major logistics insurance platform in China.  The cryptocurrency has soared 21 percent in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap, possibly helped by a new listing on Bithumb, the major South Korean cryptocurrency exchange.

The project, built on a blockchain called Primechain-ASSET, will see the creation of an exchange for selling and buying stressed assets, said Sudin Baraokar, innovation adviser at State Bank of India, a member of BankChain.  Stressed assets include non-performing assets (NPAs), restructured loans, assets under reconstruction and written-off assets.  Allowing banks to divide up stressed assets and sell them to other banks, asset reconstruction companies or funds, the blockchain platform comprises a smart contract-powered auction system, built-in regulatory reporting and other features. The blockchain will also offer a repository for documents related to the assets, according to the release.  Baraokar continued:  ""This [project] will help banks get a more data and market-driven price discovery of stressed assets and will automate and bring a more orchestrated effort for sale of Non-Performing Assets (NPAs). By leveraging blockchain, we can then continue to develop more structured products once we have a Loan Asset Exchange system in place.""  NPAs have come into limelight recently, as an observed decline in asset quality has been touted as an economic risk for banks.  ""Stressed assets have become a multi-trillion dollar challenge for the global banking sector. The gross non-performing assets of the banks in India are over Rs. 8 lakh crore [$123 billion],"" Shinam Arora, CEO of Primechain, said in the statement.

During a meeting with Taiwan's legislative arm Monday, central bank governor Yang Chin-long was questioned over how the banking authority would address the current ""opacity"" in bitcoin trading in the country, as highlighted by the recent price plunge, according to Taiwan's Central News Agency.  Responding to parliament member's enquiries, the governor said the central bank has increased its efforts in monitoring the volatile movements of bitcoin prices and will issue warnings to investors over the risks of cryptocurrency transactions.  Further to that effort, Yang said the banking authority has also recommended to Taiwan's Ministry of Justice that bitcoin trading should be regulated under current anti-money laundering (AML) rules in the financial sector.  While it remains to be seen if the suggestion will find support at the ministry, the effort marks the latest move by Taiwanese authorities in placing bitcoin regulation on their agenda.  Earlier this month, the island's finance minister, Sheu Yu-jer, stated his belief that cryptocurrencies – which are treated as virtual commodities – should be taxed in Taiwan, adding that the agency is currently studying how to implement relevant taxation rules.  Yang's comments also come at a time when other major Asian governments have already moved to regulate cryptocurrencies under anti-money laundering rules to prevent financial crimes.  As reported by CoinDesk, South Korea formally prohibited domestic banks from providing virtual, anonymous accounts for cryptocurrency exchange users and mandated a new real-name verification process from February 2018.

42428779,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLdwRh,1522663243,Above $7K: Bitcoin Eyes Gains After Death Cross Fails,"Despite having witnessed a so-called ""death cross"" over the weekend, bitcoin (BTC) is now eyeing gains above the $7,000 mark.  The much-feared technical indicator (bearish crossover between the 50-day moving average (MA) and the 200-day MA) was confirmed over the weekend, but, as anticipated by CoinDesk, the oversold conditions seem to have put a floor under bitcoin prices.  As of writing, CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) is seen at $7,040, having clocked a 54-day low of $6,443 on Sunday. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency was last seen changing hands at $7,060 on Bitfinex – up 9.88 percent from the previous day's low of $6,425.  The recovery is pretty much in line with the historical pattern, which shows that bitcoin tends to regain poise every time the relative strength index (RSI) drops to or below 30.00.  Daily chart  As seen on the daily chart prices as per Bitfinex) above, the RSI fell to 30.00 on Friday, signaling oversold conditions. Further, the death cross was confirmed on Saturday, but did not do significant damage to bitcoin's price.  It's worth noting that the death cross looked pretty unconvincing before it occurred, i.e. the 50-day MA turned neutral (flatlined) a week ago and remains neutral after the bearish crossover, validating the argument put forward by the daily RSI that BTC is oversold. A falling 50-day MA pre- and post-crossover could have brought in a lot of technical sellers.  Further, the cryptocurrency has successfully defended the key ascending trendline seen on the weekly chart below.  Weekly chart (linear scale)  Bitcoin avoided a break below the confluence of the ascending trendline and the rising (bullish biased) weekly 50-MA, amid oversold conditions.  So, it appears the cryptocurrency has made a short-term low at $6,425 and could visit $7,500–$7,600 in the next few days, as indicated by the bullish-RSI divergence on the chart below.  4-hour chart  BTC has breached the descending trendline, but only a clear break above $7,100 (channel resistance) would add credence to the bullish RSI divergence and allow a rally to $7,500–$7,600.  That said, further gains are ruled out in the short-term, because the 10-day MA is biased to the bears (sloping downwards).  Daily chart II  In the chart above, the 5-day MA and 10-day MA are bearish, and a sustained rally to $8,000 and beyond is only likely after they have bottomed out.  View  BTC seems to have made a temporary low at $6,425. A clear break above $7,100 could yield a rally to $7,600.  Further gains cannot be ruled out, but will likely happen only after the 5-day MA and 10-day MA have shed bearish bias.  On the downside, $6,425 is an immediate support, which if breached, would allow a re-test of the February low of $6,000. However, the bears will have a tough time taking out support $6,425, courtesy of short-term oversold conditions.

42428773,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLdw9h,1522659622,Bitcoin Is Close to Cutting Fees with Better Coin Selection,"One of the technical mechanisms that has helped earn bitcoin comparisons to cash is on the verge of a major update.  Called ""coin selection,"" the term refers to the algorithm that today decides which bits of data come together to create a user's transaction. Essentially, the coin selection code replicates the process of giving, say, a $10 bill to a cashier for a $7 item and the consumer receiving $3 in change.  But if that doesn't sound particularly complex, remember bitcoin is experimental software, and this function, while working, isn't altogether optimized. Making matters worse, the part that perhaps needs tweaking has a direct impact on user costs.  ""Bitcoin Core's original coin selection algorithm actually needs a lot of reworking, especially with regards to transaction fees. It's inefficient and it ends up doing a weird loop to try to guess the amount of transaction fees that are needed,"" Bitcoin Core contributor Andrew Chow told CoinDesk.  Mark Erhardt an engineer at wallet provider BitGo agrees, going so far as to call the algorithm ""convoluted"" during a recent interview on the podcast Noded.  As such, developers have been working on a new algorithm, dubbed ""branch and bound"" or ""BnB,"" which forges together data in a more efficient way, resulting in a small scaling bump and lower transaction fees.  Erhardt first proposed some optimizations nearly two years ago, while Chow was the first developer to code up the changes.  And recently the change was deemed ready to be added to bitcoin's most popular software implementation, Bitcoin Core, and so was merged into the codebase. Even better for users, the feature should be available for widespread use with the release of the 17th version of the software in the next year or so.  Speaking to the benefits of the changes, Chow said:  ""This will let us tidy up the coin selection code a lot and actually make it possible for one person to understand exactly what the coin selection algorithm is doing.""  No change needed  Stepping back, as mentioned, each bitcoin transaction a user sends is made up of different smaller amounts of bitcoin.  That's because, say you have one bitcoin in your wallet, this bitcoin is usually not just one piece of data. Rather, it's often made up of a number of chunks of data pieced together. You might have one, two or dozens of little transaction chunks – each called ""unspent transaction outputs"" (UTXOs).  For instance, tied to your bitcoin wallet address might be one piece of data worth 0.1 BTC, another worth 0.3 BTC, another of 0.1 BTC and a last one, worth 0.5 BTC, to make up a whole bitcoin.  These pieces are based on the transactions that came before them and how they were initially split up to send to your wallet.  So, if you need to send 0.2 BTC, the Bitcoin Core ""coin selection"" algorithm might decide to put the piece of data worth 0.3 BTC in what's called the ""input,"" creating the transaction. There will then be two outputs: 0.2 BTC, which will be sent to the recipient, and 0.1 BTC, which will be put back into your wallet as the ""change output.""  Yet, according to the developers, the algorithm isn't all that good at deciding how to select coins for transactions.  The algorithm almost always automatically creates ""change outputs,"" which often aren't necessary and waste space on the blockchain, Erhardt explained. In the example above, the algorithm could avoid this by picking the two pieces of data worth 0.1 BTC and not have to send ""change"" back to the sender at all.  He continued, speaking to another unfortunate side effect:  ""You don’t want transactions to be ground up to dust.""  ""Dust"" are pieces of bitcoin that are so small they're almost not worth spending, since the fees could be more than the transaction itself. They're perhaps analogous to pennies, in that a penny actually costs more to make than it's actually worth in purchasing goods.  How to choose?  The new algorithm, BnB, avoids these issuers by trying to eliminate as many change output scenarios as possible. In short, it looks at all the inputs to see if there's a way to reach exactly the number of bitcoins a user wants to send in a transaction.  ""This helps shrink the UTXO set a little more,"" Chow said. ""Additionally, transactions, where an exact match was found, will generally be smaller than ones where there is change, so this will also save on transaction fees for the user and free up a few more bytes of block space to fit in other transactions.""  And there's evidence this works. In a simulation, Erhardt found that, in approximately 40 percent of transactions that would normally have change outputs, the new algorithm was able to get rid of the unnecessary data.  In addition to these user benefits, the code change also helps developers, since the new algorithm is much easier to understand for a technical standpoint.  Still, developers aren't done tweaking the coin selection process. Chow and others plan to take the algorithm further, by adding a so-called ""simple random draw.""  When the BnB algorithm goes through all a bitcoin user's UTXOs and simply can't avoid creating a change output, it then falls back on the original coin selection process. But with simple random draw, the algorithm will choose random UTXOs until it reaches the amount of money required.  Interestingly, developers find randomly choosing coins is a better method than the more deliberate algorithm Bitcoin Core uses today.  It's the culmination of years of work, but according to Erhardt, the process couldn't have been much quicker. Coin selection is a ""sensitive part"" of the code and changing it has ""global consequences,"" he said.  As such, ""no one wanted to fiddle with it for too long,"" Erhardt explained, adding:  ""Now we've put in a lot of the plumbing for further changes.""

Investors trading cryptos in the country are expected to face a 7 percent value added tax (VAT) for all trades in addition to a 15 percent tax on capital gains, according to a report by Nikkei Asian Review on Friday.  The move marks the latest effort to regulate cryptocurrencies in Thailand following two royal decree drafts that were previously passed by the Cabinet of Thailand, the executive branch of the country's government.  As reported before, one of the two decree drafts specifically eyed regulation on cryptocurrency taxation in an effort to prevent money laundering and tax avoidance.

While retail investors may be eligible to waive the VAT if they are trading through a cryptocurrency exchange after the law goes into effect, they will still face the liability if they have no capital gains from crypto trading, according to the Post.  The report also said the draft law is now pending publication by the Royal Gazette, after which it will be formally enacted.

42428775,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLdwJh,1522641605,Do You Owe the IRS for Crypto-to-Crypto Trades?,"James Markwood is a Partner at Cogent Law Group in Washington, D.C.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's Crypto and Taxes 2018 series.      To some, the attitude of crypto traders resembles the world of Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz.  They amble through the magical Land of Oz, following the yellow (gold) brick road, guided by a motley, sometimes bizarre, cast of characters, often oblivious to the dangers and realities of the world in which they live.  In particular, the tax world in which they live.  Many crypto traders have believed that they are “off the radar” of tax authorities, who simply won’t find out about their transactions. And, even many who do accept that they may have to report their profits from crypto have taken the position that they have no tax liability until they eventually receive “fiat” currency, and should not be taxed on coin for coin exchanges.  But, just as Dorothy realized that she wasn’t in Kansas anymore, crypto traders now are recognizing – perhaps reluctantly – that they must take into account U.S. tax liability and reporting obligations.  The IRS and the U.S. Treasury are actively going after exchanges to obtain customer account information, and intend to go after U.S. citizens, residents and non-residents who are subject to U.S. tax, regarding their gains from coin transactions.  It definitely is time for coin traders to examine their tax obligations and filing options, including whether they can defer gains under the like-kind exchange rules.  Sales and exchanges  In general, amounts realized from a sale or exchange of property are subject to U.S. tax. A sale is defined as a transfer of property for money (or a promise to pay money).   Consequently, there is little question that a sale of any crypto coin for fiat money (U.S. or foreign) is a taxable transaction in the eyes of the IRS. The seller must report the amount of any gain (or loss) in the year the disposition occurred.  But, what about exchanges of crypto coin for a different type of crypto coin?  The IRS views cryptocurrencies as property, not currency, so any exchange of crypto coins should be treated as an “exchange of property” within the meaning of the tax code (and not a “sale” of property for currency).  Such exchanges must be considered taxable unless a specific nonrecognition exception applies, and the tax regulations explicitly state that any exceptions to the general rule requiring recognition must be strictly construed.  Like-kind exchange exception  One important exception to the general rule that exchanges of property are immediately taxable is the “like-kind” exchange rule under Section 1031 of the Code.  Under Section 1031, no gain or loss is recognized if property held for investment (or for productive use in a trade or business) is exchanged solely for property of like kind.  For crypto traders, the ability to use like-kind exchange rules to avoid U.S. tax on their trades is a bit of a “good news/bad news” story.  First, the bad news. Buried deep in the massive tax bill enacted at the end of 2017 was a provision that limits like-kind exchanges to real estate transactions, effective after December 31, 2017.  As a result, there seems to be zero ability for crypto traders to claim that their coin trades undertaken after 2017 qualify as Section 1031 like-kind exchanges.  Trades before 2018  Crypto traders still may be able to argue that their transactions undertaken in 2017 and prior years were not taxable under the Section 1031 like-kind exchange rules. But, the application of the like-kind exchange rules to crypto transactions is far from certain.  One area of uncertainty is whether one type of crypto coin should be considered to be of “like-kind” with another type of coin for purposes of the Section 1031 rules. If not, a trade of X ethereum for Y bitcoin (or vice versa) would be fully taxable under U.S. tax rules. The trader would have a taxable gain to the extent the value of the coins received exceeds the tax basis of the coins relinquished.  In general, properties are of like kind if they are of the same nature or character, even if they differ in grade or quality. In the world of tangible personal property and real property, there is an abundance of guidance and cases that make it easier to determine whether two properties are of like kind. If tangible personal properties exchanged are in the same prescribed “general asset classes” (used for depreciation purposes), they qualify.  Thus, for example, an exchange of a computer for a printer is considered to be “like kind” because the two properties are in the same asset class. But, an exchange of a light duty truck for a heavy duty truck would not qualify, because they are in different asset classes.  The code specifically excludes certain intangible assets from Section 1031 like-kind exchange treatment, including stocks, bonds, notes, partnership interests, certificates of trust, and “other securities.” There is no authority treating cryptocurrencies as “securities” for purposes of Section 1031.  But, because issuance of crypto coins may be treated as an issuance of securities under federal securities law, it is possible the IRS could argue that coin exchanges are “securities” excluded from 1031 treatment.  The regulations state that exchanges of other intangible personal property qualify for nonrecognition under section 1031 if the exchanged properties are of “like kind.” The regulations do not provide asset classes for intangible assets, in contrast to tangible property. But they note that whether intangible personal properties are of a like kind to each other generally depends on the nature or character of the rights involved and the nature of the underlying property to which the intangible personal property relates.  The regulations, as well as various court decisions and IRS rulings, provide some guidance on exchanges that do and do not qualify for Section 1031 like-kind exchange treatment.  For example, these swaps would qualify for like-kind treatment, and hence the tax exemption:  A copyright on a novel for a copyright on a different novel  A copyright on a novel for a copyright on a song  Gold bullion for Canadian Maple Leaf gold coins  Gold coins minted by one country for gold coins minted by another where the coins were no longer circulating as currency  Whereas these trades would not get the exemption, and therefore are taxable:  U.S. currency for foreign currency  Silver bullion for gold bullion  Of these examples, the exchanges of gold bullion for gold coins, gold coins from different countries, and copyrights for different books, arguably might be analogous to exchanges of two different species of crypto coins.  Crypto coin traders who engaged in coin-for-coin trades in 2017 and earlier years should consider taking the position that their gains are deferrable under the Section 1031 like-kind exchange rules.  Of course, because there is no supporting (or contrary) authority directly addressing these transactions, there can be no guarantee that the IRS will agree that crypto coin trades qualify for Section 1031 exchange treatment.  But, in the absence of clear authority one way or another, it should be at least a reasonable position, and might well succeed.  Reporting obligations  Taxpayers who choose to report their coin-for-coin exchanges as like-kind exchanges should be mindful of their record-keeping and reporting obligations.  In particular, Form 8824 must be filed with the taxpayer’s federal income tax return, to provide information about each property given up (e.g., its acquisition date and tax basis) as well as the property received.  Traders should seek advice from a qualified tax advisor regarding their filing obligations, especially regarding filings for prior tax years in connection with amended tax returns reporting their transactions in those years.

42428765,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLdvzh,1522630835,TD Bank Considers Public Blockchain for Asset Tracking,"One of Canada's largest banks may be considering the use of a public blockchain to digitally track assets.  In a patent application published Thursday, TD Bank outlined how it could use a public distributed ledger to help point-of-sale computers track transactions. In the scheme, computers would create blocks of data in which information about the assets being sold, their value in a given currency and the transactions themselves would be stored.  Filed in September 2016, it's not clear if the bank has pursued the idea further than the application. However, it's a notable indication of interest, as big bank blockchain work has generally been confined to private or permissioned ledgers (though that may be changing).  That said, the filing offers ample praise for public blockchains, in which any individuals running the software may successfully approve transactions.  ""One advantage of block chain [sic] based ledgers is the public nature of the block chain architecture that allows anyone in the public to review the content of the ledger and verify ownership,"" the application states.  Going further, such a ledger would allow anyone to verify that a transaction occurred, while using a decentralized platform increases redundancy, thereby “[minimizing] risk of falsification of ledgers.”  Elsewhere, the patent also comments on the slower speed of such a system, suggesting TD Bank may be becoming more accustomed to the attributes of blockchain systems that have been treated by other institutions as drawbacks.
