Arcane Research&apos;s weekly update shows that the ETHBTC pair reached its highest level since May 2018 reaching 0.085 BTC, seeing possible signals of maturity and an upcoming alt-season. In 2021, ETH has shown greater strength than bitcoin. The cryptocurrency could be signaling its maturity as it sees higher lows -compared to BTC- than it did in 2017 and 2018. However, Arcane Research noted that back in 2021 and 2018 the strength of ETH and altcoins&apos; performances in periods when BTC saw lows also signaled lower prices to come, so a similar scenario could happen during 2021&apos;s fourth quarter. The current ETHBTC pair peak is similar to the one seen in May, which was followed by May 19th&apos;s crash during massive liquidations and new buyers panic -which some users called the second worse day ever for Ethereum, although similar phenomenons had happened in earlier years-.

42424128,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2khZh,1638919831,First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Rises on Encouraging Omicron News Before Falling Back; Ether Drops Slightly,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market moves: Bitcoin rose following gains in the traditional market.  Technician’s take: Bitcoin is attempting to reverse its weekend sell-off, although upside appears limited.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $50,529 -.10%  Ether (ETH): $4,303 -0.6%  Markets  S&P 500: $4,686 +2%  Dow Jones Industrial Average: $35,719 +1.4%  Nasdaq: $15,686 +3%  Gold: $1,783 +0.1%  Market moves  Bitcoin spent most of Tuesday trading above $51,000 as the stock market rose sharply amid growing optimism that the new Omicron coronavirus variant would be less damaging to the economy than previously thought.  Bitcoin’s price had fallen back by the time of publications, was slightly down over the past 24 hours. The No. 1 cryptocurrency by market capitalization’s trading volume across major centralized exchange was low on Tuesday. Ether, meanwhile, was down about 1% over the same period.  Blockchain data suggested the market crash over the weekend resulted from a “weak hand purge,” according to blockchain analytics firm Santiment. Bitcoin’s network realized profit/loss (NPL in short) chart shows that Saturday’s correction triggered one of this year’s largest drops in bitcoin’s NPL.  NPL takes the price at which bitcoin last moved on the blockchain – assuming it was bitcoin’s acquisition price – and divides by the price of the bitcoin when it changes addresses again, which is the price Santiment assumes as the sell price.  The drop in NPL suggests “a significant amount of BTC transferred over the weekend were being moved at a loss compared to the last time they changed addresses,” Santiment explained in its analysis on Tuesday.  The takeaway? Bitcoin may face some short-term downward pressure amid “rising FUD [fear, uncertainty and doubt] among some BTC holders,” Santiment concluded.  Alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoin) gained and some of the biggest winners of the day included tezos (XTZ), omg network (OMG), and harmony (ONE).  Technician’s take  Bitcoin Returns Above $50K; Resistance at $53K-$55K  Bitcoin (BTC) is attempting to reverse its weekend sell-off, although the cryptocurrency’s price could face short-term resistance around $53,000-$55,000. BTC was trading around $50,000 at the time of publication and is up about 3% over the past 24 hours.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the four-hour chart is rising from extreme oversold levels, suggesting that buyers could remain active over the short-term. Still, BTC remains in a month-long downtrend, defined by the downward sloping 100-day moving average on the four-hour chart. Downtrends tend to limit price rises as sellers outnumber buyers.  Price momentum is still negative on the weekly chart, which means more time is needed for bitcoin to decisively break above its short-term downtrend.

Enso Finance, a platform for building, sharing and trading index fund–style cryptocurrency portfolios, announced in a blog post plans for a vampire attack on six leading DeFi index platforms.  Vampire attacks in DeFi occur when a competitor to an incumbent protocol – often a fork of the “victim’s” code – offers superior incentives designed to entice users to move their deposits from one platform to another.  In Enso’s case, the platform is taking aim at Index Coop, TokenSets, dHedge, PowerPool, PieDAO and Indexed Finance, which account for nearly $500 million in total value locked (TVL) among them.  Read more: DAO Behind DeFi Pulse Index Raises $7.7M From Galaxy Digital, 1kx  In an interview with CoinDesk, Enso founder Connor Howe declined to specify the type of APY users can expect upon migrating, but it will presumably need to be generous – many of the platforms Enso is looking to leech liquidity from already incentivize users with upwards of 30% APY in governance token emissions.  In addition to a liquidity mining program, Enso is also launching with a gamified dashboard, non-fungible token rewards and will be covering the gas costs associated with migration. The team also hinted the NFTs could have additional utility in the future.  New features  Once users have made the migration, Howe hopes Enso’s various features and functionalities will be able to keep them around.  CoinDesk saw a demo of the platform that enabled users to build indexes out of a wide range of assets, yield-vaulted and revenue-bearing assets, and with other indexes as well, allowing them to create an “ETF of ETFs,” as Howe put it, referring to exchange-traded funds.  Index creators can also set performance fees as well as timelocks for how frequently index managers are allowed to swap assets into and out of the index. These indexes can also be controlled by a multi-sig, meaning that the product can operate as a treasury management solution as well.  “Anyone can create a strategy, and that’s the key differentiator here,” said Howe.  ‘A fun experiment’  The index or structured-product market has largely lagged behind DeFi generally, accounting for just a fraction of the sector’s $280 billion in TVL. One possible reason is perpetually playing catchup: By the time a platform has created a new index, the market may have moved on to a new narrative.  It’s a pain point Enso is focused on in particular. One forthcoming feature called “recipes” will allow users to add any yield vaults and new contracts they want, allowing users to add new farms or yield-bearing strategies as they come to market.  The team also has a competition planned that will measure the performance of user-built indexes and reward top earners.  “It’s going to be a fun experiment,” Howe added. “The whole team’s excited to see this go live.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION | TRADING,Andrew Thurman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/12/07/defi-index-project-to-launch-with-vampire-attack-on-index-coop-others,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b2571f63de8320c3b5fd03f9f63d577530105a47-5184x3456.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The new 10T DAE 3.0 Fund caps a busy year for the firm. In September, 10T added $389 million in capital commitments to its war chest through two inaugural growth equity funds, 10T Fund and 10T DAE Expansion Fund.  10T had launched a $200 million 10T Holdings fund earlier this year to invest in cryptocurrency startups.

42424103,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2khNh,1638916387,Regulators’ Stablecoin Report Met With Bipartisan Pushback,"The stablecoin report published last month by the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets (PWG) made ripples across the crypto industry with its recommendation that Congress enact legislation to regulate stablecoin issuers like banks, but that appears to be a nonstarter among the crypto-literate on Capitol Hill.  At an event hosted by blockchain research firm Chainalysis on Monday, Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), a longtime crypto supporter and chairman of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus, pushed back against the recommendations, saying:  “I’ll put it bluntly this way: Regulating stablecoin issuers like banks, which is what the report suggests – it’ll kill American competitiveness.”  Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.), echoed Emmer’s reluctance to rush to enact the legislation recommended by the PWG.  “One shouldn’t assume that we’ll necessarily follow the recommendations,” Himes said. “I am also skeptical of the notion that all stablecoin issuers should be forced to be banks.”  Emmer also argued against the notion that stablecoins are unregulated, saying stablecoin regulation already exists at the state level in several states including New York and Wyoming.  The lack of crypto education on Capitol Hill – a growing concern for many supporters of the industry – was also cited by both Himes and Emmer as a reason not to rush to action.  Himes told the audience that he thought stablecoin regulation was “maybe not necessary right now, and certainly not likely right now.”  Emmer was more blunt:  “Most members don’t understand stablecoins, so expediting legislation could actually be a recipe for disaster,” he said.  Emmer, however, was quick to point out that his stance on stablecoin regulation doesn’t mean he is against regulating the industry in general.: Providing a “light touch regulatory framework” – starting with defining terms like “currency,” “commodity” and “security” – could help encourage innovation in the industry, he said.  Emmer also said that establishing the jurisdiction of the market regulators – the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which are in the midst of a tug-of-war over crypto regulation – would help curb the “very dangerous practice of regulators and other bureaucrats in the marketplace regulating through enforcement action.”  “If we don’t clear up the gray regulatory space for the crypto industry, threats – like those that come from the SEC – of enforcement action are going to continue,” Emmer said.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/12/07/regulators-stablecoin-report-met-with-bipartisan-pushback,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5f486638a41065d9b050e4aff78546bd914952f8-5200x3470.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Known as “Glupteba,” the botnet has infected more than 1 million machines worldwide, Google said in a civil complaint filed Tuesday against Dmitry Staroviko and Alexander Filippov, as well as 15 unknown individuals. Google alleged the defendants utilized this botnet to mine cryptocurrencies on victims’ computers, steal victims’ account information to sell to third parties, purchase goods and services using credit cards with insufficient funds and sell access to compromised machines to third parties.  Moreover, the botnet itself leveraged blockchain technology in a unique manner as an effort to secure it against traditional tools meant to disrupt these types of malicious activities. It effectively turned Bitcoin’s decentralization into an asset that made it “much harder to shut down,” Google executives wrote in a blog post.  The botnet weaponized the Bitcoin blockchain, according to Chainalysis, which said it helped Google’s investigation. By embedding command-and-control server addresses in the blockchain and then having the botnet turn to that data whenever an infected server was shuttered, it stays a step ahead of the cybersecurity whack-a-mole.  “This is the first known case of a botnet using this approach,” representatives for Chainalusis said in an email.  Google’s complaint went into more detail, saying that the “Glupteba Enterprise,” the entity controlled by the defendants, would use this method to direct the malware to new servers.  The botnet looked at three specific bitcoin addresses, according to a Google blog post.  Google said that while it has already taken some action to disrupt the botnet, the fact that it uses the Bitcoin blockchain means the operators can resurrect the network at any time.  “The Glupteba botnet cannot be eradicated entirely without neutralizing its blockchain-based infrastructure,” the complaint said.

42424102,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2khLh,1638916042,OCC Nominee Omarova Withdraws From Bank Regulator Consideration,"U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) nominee Saule Omarova has withdrawn her name to be the next head of the federal bank regulator, weeks after a contentious confirmation hearing where both Democrats and Republicans indicated they would not vote for her.  Omarova, who has criticized both the banking and cryptocurrency sectors, was nominated to head the federal bank regulator in September by U.S. President Joe Biden. Her nomination was met with opposition from the banking industry, due to past remarks she made about having the Federal Reserve take over aspects of the current banking system.  The Cornell University professor faced a hostile confirmation hearing in mid-November, which largely focused on her comments about the role of commercial banks in the U.S. financial sector. She was also called a “Communist” in the course of the hearing.  Following the hearing, five Democrat senators reportedly expressed concerns about voting for her. A final confirmation hearing in the Senate Banking Committee was not scheduled.  “I deeply value President Biden’s trust in my abilities and remain firmly committed to the Administration’s vision of a prosperous, inclusive, and just future for our country. At this point in the process, however, it is no longer tenable for me to continue as a Presidential nominee,” Omarova wrote in a letter withdrawing her nomination.  In a statement, Biden said he accepted Omarova’s withdrawal, saying he nominated her due to her “expertise in financial regulation.”  “As a strong advocate for consumers and a staunch defender of the safety and soundness of our financial system, Saule would have brought invaluable insight and perspective to our important work on behalf of the American people.

On December 3rd, Bitcoin&apos;s price wicked into the lows at $40,000 resulting in a record number of liquidated positions across exchange platforms. Related Reading | Crypto Market Analysis: December 6, 2021 At the time of writing, almost every cryptocurrency, but Bitcoin in the top 10 by market cap seems to show signs of recovery. The benchmark crypto trades at barely north of $50,000 after it was rejected at $51,500 with small losses in the past 24-hours. Data from Arcane Research shows that the Fear and Greed Index has been fluctuating with the price of large crypto by market cap. During the last week, this metric stood in the &apos;Fear&apos; levels right up until Friday&apos;s crash when it dipped further into &apos;Extreme Fear&apos;. Although the metric was able to bounce from a low at 16 it now scores a 25 in the metric, almost 50 points less than in November when it stood at Greed with 73. The index is still close to its yearly lows, and closer to post-May 2021 levels when an increase in selling pressure slumped the prices of every major crypto. These levels remained at their lows from that moment until mid-August, when Bitcoin finally broke above $40,000 and into an all-time high at $69,000.

42424122,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2ko5h,1638915366,Bitcoin Technical Indicator Suggests Low Probability of ‘Santa Rally’,"Bitcoin may not be able to build on the relief rally as it heads into the end of the year, a key technical indicator that’s flipped bearish amid heightened macro risks indicates.  “The weekly MACD is on a ‘sell’ signal for the first time since April, increasing risk into year end,” Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, said in a weekly research note shared with CoinDesk on Monday. There is room for a further sell-off to a point where the asset starts looking oversold in the intermediate term, she wrote.  The MACD (moving average convergence divergence) histogram is a technical indicator used to identify trend reversals and trend strength.  The indicator’s dip into negative territory implies a bullish-to-bearish trend change. Deeper bars below the zero line indicate strengthening of bearish momentum.  The previous bearish crossover confirmed in late April was followed by consecutive weekly losses of more than 10% that saw the price of bitcoin drop to $30,000 from $58,000.  While bitcoin has bounced almost 20% from Saturday’s low of under $43,000, the cryptocurrency has yet to retake the bullish trendline from July lows breached last week.  According to Stockton, the bounce could be fleeting with upside likely to be capped around resistance at $55,000.

42394015,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bsRFsJ,1638915240,Most Influential 2021: Sam Bankman-Fried,"He might now be a billionaire, but Samuel Bankman-Fried still has that wild puff of hair. It’s hair that screams “just rolled out of bed.” Or a beanbag chair. “I’m up to something like 50%, in terms of sleeping on beds,” Bankman-Fried tells CoinDesk.  The 50% is a big deal. And beds were once a luxury that Bankman-Fried couldn’t afford. Only a year ago, the former trader spent most nights sleeping under his desk in Hong Kong while launching a then-obscure trading firm. (I called him once at 3:30 a.m. Hong Kong time. He was at the office and happily took my call.) Most Americans had never heard of FTX. Even most bitcoiners had never heard of FTX, an exchange that – at the time – focused on professional trading products like derivatives.  This post is part of CoinDesk’s Most Influential 2021 series. Pindar Van Arman’s NFT portrait of Sam Bankman-Fried is available at SuperRare.  Fast forward one year.  The Miami Heat now play in the FTX Arena. Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen star in FTX commercials. During the World Series, you couldn’t miss the FTX signs behind home plate, the countless FTX commercials, or the FTX patches on the umpires’ uniforms. FTX became “the official cryptocurrency exchange of MLB,” as if baseball has used a crypto exchange since the days of Mickey Mantle.  Flush off a $420 million round of fundraising, FTX is now worth an estimated $25 billion, and Bankman-Fried – not yet 30 – is one of the richest and most powerful people on the planet.  That doesn’t seem to have changed the man. He still eats “when it seems appropriate for the given day,” which sometimes means 3 p.m., sometimes 3 a.m. He remains a vegan for humanitarian reasons (“it’s all for animal welfare”), and he still reaches for his beloved Oreos, “one of nature’s more surprising vegan foods.”  And he’s laser-focused on regulation. Earlier in the year, Bankman-Fried spent five hours a day personally dealing with regulatory issues, and he expects regulation to loom over 2022. “It’s a messy world, and there are 195 countries out there,” he says. “Each one is separately exploring what their regulatory framework will look like. We’re trying to stay abreast of all of them.”  Regulation is what drove FTX to move its headquarters from Hong Kong to the Bahamas, because Bankman-Fried says the islands “have a comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto, and very few countries have that.”  Bankman-Fried sees over-regulation as the biggest risk to bitcoin. He views a “hard ban” as unlikely, but acknowledges risk in a “soft ban.”  Pindar Van Arman’s NFT portrait of Sam Bankman-Fried is available at SuperRare.  “If we saw coordinated action of restricting access to cryptocurrency projects in the United States and the European Union, that could have a materially bad impact on the market,” the FTX CEO says.  As for regulation in 2022? Bankman-Fried predicts there will “almost certainly” be some type of stablecoin regulation, because there’s “a lot of noise around it, and there’s a lot of will for it,” such as periodic audits of what’s backing the tokens. That could have merit. Like the Winklevoss twins, Bankman-Fried views regulation in the U.S. as inevitable and even useful, telling CNN that “the strongest version of the crypto industry is one that does have regulatory oversight.”  Some risks to bitcoin, Bankman-Fried says, have already become less concerning. Exhibit A: the risk of institutional investors fleeing the market. He finds it useful to compare the state of bitcoin today, at the end of 2021, with bitcoin at the end of 2017.  “Going into 2018, there was an enormous amount of excitement,” Bankman-Fried says, as “institutions worldwide were actively trying to decide whether or not to get involved.” Then came the crash. These crypto-curious institutions felt they had dodged a bullet, and they remained on the sidelines. The price of bitcoin languished.  “It ended up taking another two or three years for a number of them to get in,” Bankman-Fried says. He imagines that if a crash had occurred during the summer of 2020, perhaps that would have dissuaded large institutions from entering crypto. But now they are in. The die is cast. “At this point, I think many of them are more committed to it now than they were,” says Bankman-Fried, and he expects more to join the party in 2022. “It would take substantially more negative effects to halt that momentum.”  Read More: 7 Crypto Billionaires Make Forbes 2021 List of Richest Americans  I was curious what the “negative effects” could mean for FTX itself, particularly given its massive expansion. To the outside eye, it seems that FTX spent like a drunken sailor on the advertising spree. And that happened during a throbbing bull run, where everyone looks like a genius. What would happen to FTX if, say, the price of bitcoin plummets?  Bankman-Fried isn’t losing sleep over that, or at least any more sleep than usual. First, and amazingly, he says FTX’s entire endorsement and partnership budget accounts for less than 10% of 2021 revenue, and so it’s “not a huge hit on that front.” If bitcoin crashed to $20,000, theoretically, Bankman-Fried would expect long-term revenue (“or at least medium-term revenue”) to suffer, but he said, “I would be shocked if it went down to a point where we were no longer profitable.”  And even if bitcoin enters a bear market, that fresh round of $420 million gives FTX “a pretty decent firewall of money.” And that firewall could soon become even more “decent”; recent reports indicate that FTX is looking to raise $1.5 billion at a potential valuation of $32 billion.  The son of Stanford Law School professors, Bankman-Fried is a longtime follower of “effective altruism.” That is, trying to make as much money as possible so that he can then donate funds in a way that optimizes their impact. In 2020, he performed a rough calculus and determined that his money could serve the greatest good with one simple function: to boot Donald Trump from the White House. His $5 million donation to the Joe Biden campaign – he’s one of the largest donors – is unusual in the libertarian-heavy world of crypto.  “I have given to some Republicans, I’ve given to some Democrats,” Bankman-Fried says diplomatically, then immediately clarifies that “I’ve given more to Democrats at this point.” He cares more about policy than party fealty.  Bankman-Fried seemed appalled, for example, by the Democrats’ proposed tax on billionaires, telling the New York Times’ DealBook, “I think this could cause hugely negative collateral damage, significantly reducing the amount of innovation and taxable base in the first place.”  Read More: FTX to Seek $1.5B in New Funding Round at $32B Valuation: Report  As for 2024? “It’s hard for me to have a great prediction of that, without knowing who the candidates are going to end up being,” which, intentionally or not, is an almost hilarious low-key swipe at Biden.  Besides, 2024 is a lifetime away, especially in crypto years. By then, we’ll be celebrating New Year’s Eve in Midtown Manhattan at the FTX Times Square, we’ll buy our holiday gifts using the FTX cash app, and little kids will hope that Santa brings them gifts from the FTX North Pole.  That is all in play. The only safe bet is that Bankman-Fried still won’t have combed his hair.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TRADING,Jeff Wilser,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/12/07/most-influential-2021-sam-bankman-fried,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8adcfa25b6789ae56b706e48d0be41d1eebb29c0-2900x2900.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

And some gamers are peeved.  On one side of the argument are crypto investors and observers heralding the move as a bellwether of things to come: The integration marks the first time a mainstream video game is adding NFTs to its in-game economy. The ability to own and sell digital goods outside the walled garden of a given title has long been a Holy Grail for crypto-minded gamers.  On the other side of the aisle are mainstream gamers wary of what that bellwether may really entail. As one gaming outlet put it, “Letting this slide is just the tacit endorsement the rest of the industry needs to nosedive into full-time crypto nonsense.”  The integration itself will be done through Ubisoft Quartzhttps://quartz.ubisoft.com/welcome/, a platform that allows players to earn “Digits,” which are in-game collectibles expressed as NFTs.  The NFTs will live on the Tezos blockchain, which – seemingly in a bid to stave off the worst of the online commentariat – Ubisoft touted as using “exceedingly less energy to operate than proof-of-work blockchains such as Bitcoin or Ethereum.”  (As we saw with a literary-minded NFT drop that was recently scuttled after fierce backlash from “Book Twitter,” those appeals to proof-of-stake’s energy savings did not pacify the online mob.)  Read more: How Misinformation on ‘Book Twitter’ Killed a Literary NFT Project  Ubisoft Quartz will launch on Dec. 9 in the U.S., Canada, Spain, France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Australia and Brazil. The company is releasing three collections of Digits for free to reward the platform’s early adopters.  Digits include “in-game vehicles, weapons, and pieces of equipment,” with each player being limited to owning one item of each edition, according to a press release.  “Ubisoft Quartz is the first building block in our ambitious vision for developing a true metaverse,” said Nicolas Pouard, vice president of Ubisoft’s Strategic Innovation Lab. “And it can’t come to life without overcoming blockchain’s early-form limitations for gaming, including scalability and energy consumption.”  Web 3 gaming has seen significant investment in recent months, headlined by a $200 million fund from Hashed and $100 million fund from Lightspeed and FTX. Traditional gaming companies have been slower to embrace the Web 3 space, but NFT integrations like Ubisoft’s could be a catalyst for adoption among other incumbent gaming giants.

42394014,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bsRFxR,1638888813,Most Influential 2021: The Developers Who Wrote Bitcoin’s Taproot Upgrade,"Bitcoin developer Jonas Nick has a T-shirt emblazoned with the following:  Gobbledygook? Hardly. It’s the full reference Schnorr signature verification code contained in Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 340  Nick along with A.J.Towns, Tim Ruffing and Pieter Wuille are the authors credited for writing the three BIPs that made up Taproot, the most significant Bitcoin upgrade in four years.  This article is part of CoinDesk’s Most Influential 2021 list. Stellabelle’s portrait of the Taproot developers is available at Foundation with 15% of the sale going to charity.  Proposed in 2017 by seminal developer Greg Maxwell, Taproot was merged into Bitcoin Core, the most widely used implementation of the network’s software, in October 2020, locked in on June 12, 2021, and then finally activated on Nov. 14. With Taproot, Bitcoin has gained a valuable set of tools for developers to integrate new features that will improve privacy, scalability and security on the original, and most valuable, cryptocurrency network.  True, the changes to Bitcoin fall squarely in the “techy” and “future potential” categories, rather than the immediate and tangible. But when it comes to evaluating some of the most important developments in Bitcoin this year, the work of Wuille, Towns, Ruffing and Jonas to make Taproot happen cannot be overlooked.  Meet the developers  Pieter Wuille  Pieter Wuille contributed to all three of the proposals that made up Taproot and took on a lead role in the process. Soon after his introduction to Bitcoin in 2010 he became a prolific contributor to Bitcoin Core’s codebase. Not only did he help ensure the success of Taproot this year, but he also was a major contributor to Segregated Witness (SegWit), a major soft fork that gave Bitcoin a more efficient way to store data; in fact, CoinDesk recognized Wuille on its Most Influential list in 2017 as well.  Wuille has a Master of Engineering in Computer Science degree from KU Leuven, a leading university in Belgium. He co-founded blockchain infrastructure company Blockstream in 2014 and was its core tech engineer before moving over to Chaincode Labs in 2020.  Jonas Nick  A developer at Blockstream since 2015, Jonas Nick also works on libsecp256k1, a cryptographic library that is used in Bitcoin Core. He is involved in researching and implementing cryptographic schemes such as MuSig2, which allows multisignature (multisig) wallets using Taproot to be indistinguishable from regular wallets. LIke Wuille, Nick is listed as an author on all three Taproot BIPs.  Stellabelle’s portrait of the Taproot developers is available at Foundation with 15% of the sale going to charity.  Tim Ruffing  Tim Ruffing is a cryptographer for Blockstream with a Ph.D. in computer science from Saarland University in Germany with a focus on cryptography in Bitcoin. His chief contribution to Taproot was as co-author of BIP 340.  Anthony Towns  Anthony Towns is listed as a co-author on BIPs 341 and 342. He is a proponent of decentralization in Bitcoin with a focus on “keeping Bitcoin stable and secure.” To that end, he recently joined the Digital Currency initiative, a group that “aims to provide long-term funding for a moderate-sized team of senior devs and researchers.” There he will lead its Bitcoin software and security effort.  Read more: Taproot, Bitcoin’s Long-Anticipated Upgrade, Has Activated  How it started  Let’s go back to Nick’s T-shirt for a moment.  At the heart of Taproot is a piece of cryptography called Schnorr signatures. These signatures were first described by Clause Schnorr in 1991 and offered a simpler, more efficient signature alternative to Bitcoin’s ECDSA scheme.  A “digital signature” is how a user signs a transaction using a private key to approve sending data (like a message or a cryptocurrency) somewhere else.  Following the upgrade, every transaction using Taproot will now use this new Schnorr digital signature scheme, adding capabilities designed to boost the privacy, security and scale of Bitcoin transactions.  In addition to being smaller and faster than ECDSA, Schnorr signatures have the added benefit of being “linear,” a combination that will boost Bitcoin’s transaction privacy and allow for more lightweight and complex “smart contracts” (encoded contracts with self-executing rules).  Read more: How Bitcoin’s Taproot Upgrade Will Improve Technology Across Bitcoin’s Software Stack  According to Wuille, the germ of the idea for Taproot emerged over lunch with Maxwell and fellow dev Andrew Poelstra. Over the following months, Ruffing, Nick and Towns joined the conversation and in May 2019, they published the first drafts of the three proposals that would eventually become Taproot.  “It was immediately clear to me [the idea] should work,” said Ruffing in an interview with CoinDesk. It was just a matter of working out the details, he said.  Ruffing had been working on cryptography in Bitcoin since 2013. For him, contributing to Taproot was a natural fit.  “As I added more and more, I eventually was added as an author,” he said.  What the devs gave us  The three Bitcoin Improvement Proposals are numbered 340, 341 and 342. Each BIP has a specific function, but they all work together to create the upgrade known as Taproot.  Authored by Wuille, Nick and Ruffing, BIP 340 specifically proposed the standard for 64-byte Schnorr signatures instead of the previous ECDSA signatures. In the BIP, the authors outlined Schnorr’s advantages over ECDSA, namely its provable security, non-malleability and linearity.  Linearity is one of the more interesting of the three features of Schnorr signatures. This means multiple collaborating parties can produce a signature that combines all their public keys, with major implications for privacy and efficiency, especially when it comes to multisignature (multisig) transactions.  “For all these advantages, there are virtually no disadvantages, apart from not being standardized,” the BIP 340 authors state. And the point of the BIP was to standardize Schnorr signatures.  Written by Wuille, Nick and Towns, BIP 341 proposed a new Segregated Witness (SegWit) version 1 output type, with spending rules based on Taproot, Schnorr signatures and Merkle branches (part of the cryptographic scheme that generates the hashes that encode data on the blockchain.) SegWit, the previous major Bitcoin upgrade, essentially allowed for larger blocks of transactions every 10 minutes or so by paring down the amount of data required per transaction signature.  BIP 341 enables the newest upgrade to work efficiently and securely with SegWit by adjusting certain spending rules and improving the privacy, efficiency and flexibility of Bitcoin’s scripting capabilities so that the two upgrades work together without a hitch.  Finally, BIP 342, written by Wuille, Nick and Towns, “specifies the semantics of the initial scripting system under BIP 341.” In other words, it ensures that all of Bitcoin’s operational code will ultimately work properly with all the new changes.  When you put these three BIPs together, you get a powerful set of new developer tools for Bitcoin.  Read more:What Taproot Could Mean for Bitcoin Investors  “First of all, it’s a privacy thing,” said Ruffing. By incorporating Schnorr signatures, he explained, a multisig public key now looks like a normal public key, and a multisig signature looks like a normal signature; that is, anyone looking at the blockchain (ahem, forensic analysts) won’t be able to tell if it’s one person signing the transaction or if it’s a group.  For example, although Lightning Network channels operate on a second layer apart from the Bitcoin base layer, they still have to open and then finally settle on the main chain. For that, Lightning Network transactions on the main chain requires a multisig (2 of 2) transaction. With Schnorr signatures and signing protocols such as MuSig2, those transactions can appear just like any other “vanilla” transaction, and no one will be able to identify them on the blockchain as “open channel” or “close channel” Lightning transactions.  Second, “it’s an efficiency thing,” said Ruffing. Previously, in a multisig transaction each of the keys of the parties involved would have to be listed out separately. That’s a lot of data. Now, by combining all these keys into one key, each transaction takes up less space, so more transactions can fit into each block.  This efficiency is also brought to bear on different forms of smart contracts. Merklized Abstract Syntax Trees (MASTs) improve smart contracts in bitcoin, making it easier for users to set more complicated conditions for a transaction. MASTs take all the various conditions set forth in the contract and arrange them into a “tree” – but then only hash the “tip” of that particular tree, without having to include (and expose) all those different rules and parameters on the blockchain.  Then, Schnorr signatures will make even that MAST transaction look like any other normal transaction.  Why Taproot?  “There’s a very high barrier to accepting soft forks into the Bitcoin Core repository because such updates need consensus from the community,” said Nick in an email.  “When Taproot was proposed it seemed like it would be possible to get overwhelming community support because it is relatively simple and it is an obvious improvement in terms of efficiency and privacy.”  That confidence was not misplaced. From the outset, the proposed Taproot changes were pretty well received. That’s not to say that there wasn’t a rigorous and lengthy discussion and debate period. After all, it still took almost four years for Taproot to activate, from start to finish.  “It was nice to see people liked the idea,” said Ruffing. “Especially after the previous [SegWit] soft fork. There was no political discussion. Just a lot of debate – as it should be.”  The closest Taproot came to a political debate was not with regards to its actual technological proposals; rather, the debate focused on how the upgrade would be implemented and who would be the ultimate arbiter of “acceptance” – the miners? The node operators? Both?  Read more:Bitcoin Miners, Developers Narrow Down How Taproot Will Be Activated  “People knew they were setting a precedent,” said Ruffing. “It was good this discussion happened.” Still, he chose to stay away from the drama of the debate. “I thought it was a better use of my time to work on cryptography. All the arguments were already there.”  Ultimately, the Bitcoin community settled on a method dubbed “Speedy Trial” wherein the miners were given a set timeframe to “signal” their support for Taproot by adding a little bit of data to every block they mined. Once 90% of the miners signaled support, which happened on June 12, the code for Taproot was “locked in” and all Bitcoin nodes were given three months to upgrade to the latest version of Bitcoin Core, 21.1, which contained that code, before it activated on Nov. 14.  How it’s going  “Activation went pretty well,” said Ruffing. “The blockchain didn’t stop, no money was lost, there were no bugs. This was expected, but it was still nice to see.”  Node uptake has been a bit slow – about 55% of all nodes have upgraded their software to 21.1 – but the real test will be developer adoption.  “It’s very interesting to see that developers are already making use of Taproot’s features,” said Nick. “This shows that there’s actually user demand for better privacy and cheaper transactions. Taproot added a lot of upgrade paths.”  Read more:After Taproot, What’s Next for Bitcoin’s Future?  For example, says Ruffing, Taproot’s multisig improvements are “useful to have” and he expects to see more product developers taking advantage of them. “Lightning Network wants to use it. Wallets want to use it.”  To that end, Ruffing, Nick and fellow developer Yannick Seurin are working on an implementation of MuSig2, a process which uses Schnorr multisignatures and allows a group of signatories to produce a joint signature on a joint message in an efficient and highly secure way. It’s not yet finalized, but it’s close, said Ruffing.  Ruffing and Nick are also working on cross-input signature aggregation (CISA) which will further boost the space-saving potential of Taproot transactions. This development could have the added benefit of making CoinJoins – transactions that mix coins from multiple senders to obscure who sent what to whom – not only more private but also less expensive and thus, more attractive to users.  “I think we will be surprised by the things people are building that we do not anticipate,” said Nick.  “Schnorr signatures alone open a zoo of possible crypto schemes that is far from being sufficiently explored. How these abstract schemes will lead to actual improvements for Bitcoin users is something I will pay close attention to.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | FORKS,Christie Harkin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/12/07/most-influential-the-developers-who-wrote-bitcoins-taproot-upgrade,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/de9aa071c17f7f40e51f48b26908ca5c2a21b9cc-3500x2625.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42394011,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bsRFXn,1638888038,Most Influential 2021: Roham Gharegozlou,"Maybe all of us missed the point.  In February 2020, in a game between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Houston Rockets, LeBron James sprinted down the court for a breakaway dunk. This wasn’t just any dunk. He threw down a reverse windmill that was eerily similar to a dunk by Kobe Bryant – nearly 20 years before – who wore the same gold jersey. This was just a month after Kobe died. It became known as the “tribute dunk.”  This article is part of CoinDesk’s Most Influential 2021 list. Panter Xhita’s portrait of Roham Gharegozlou is available at SuperRare, with 15% of the sale going to charity.  The Tribute Dunk became a valuable asset. Memorialized as an NBA Top Shot in April, the “moment” sold for a record $387,000. The press (myself included) focused on what seemed like a sky-high price for something that only sort of existed.  But the insiders noticed something else. “The press kept focusing on the big six-figure sales, but that’s not how we win,” says Dieter Shirley, chief technology officer of Dapper Labs, the company that created Top Shot. “The number I was proudest of is that we had 400,000 people on our site at the same time.”  Shirley and Roham Gharegozlou, the co-founder and CEO of Dapper, didn’t care about the frothy sales – they cared about the mainstream adoption. And the number of users grew. It grew and grew and grew. National Basketball Association fans, players and even general managers became obsessed with Top Shot. Just ask New Orleans Pelicans guard Josh Hart, who logs on multiple times a day to check the prices (“My screen time is way up because of Top Shot,” he told The Verge); or the Sacramento Kings’ Tyrese Haliburton, who loves tweeting about his Moments (“My bucket on Top Shot over $1000😭😭 I was about to buy it the other day for like 400 smh”); or Rudy Gobert, who once dunked on Hart and said as trash talk, “that would make a nice Top Shot moment.”  And as the number of users grew, the number that mattered most wasn’t $100,000 or $387,000 but something in the millions or even the billions. More than 1.2 million people have used Top Shot, making it one of the most broadly used applications in the history of crypto.  That could be just the beginning. “Revolutionizing the sports fan experience is a $100 billion opportunity,” said Gharegozlou, as “the experience of being a sports fan hasn’t yet been digitized.”  Dapper has started that digitization for sports. And because its partners now range from Warner Music Group to Dr. Seuss, the entire world could be next.  But it started with cats.  # The Future is meow  It was the summer of 2017. Gharegozlou was then the co-founder and CEO of Axiom Zen, a Vancouver, British Columbia-based venture studio that describes itself as “a startup that builds startups.” The business made money. Gharegozlou focused on emerging technologies like augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and blockchain – and eventually built products used by such customers as Adobe and Google.  Panter Xhita’s portrait of Roham Gharegozlou is available at SuperRare  Gharegozlou sensed that blockchain had potential, but he wasn’t sure how to tap it. He hoped that blockchain technology could eliminate the “platform risk” that troubled potential clients of Axiom Zen. “[Some] people didn’t want to build on us because they said, ‘This is my proprietary information, and we don’t want to rely upon you,” Gharegozlou said. That wasn’t just a problem with Axiom Zen; that was the problem with all third-party platforms. Data could be stolen. Application programming interfaces (APIs) could change or break.  For example, one of Gharegozlou’s projects was a collaboration tool called Zen Hub, which was built on GitHub. “Every time they changed their API, things broke within our product,” Gharegozlou said. “We felt platform risk in a very visceral way.”  The LeBron dunks might be the sizzle, but for Gharegozlou, the decentralized and open potential of blockchain is the steak. “That, to me, is crypto,” he said, adding that crypto isn’t just “tokens and collectibles … It’s a new kind of computer. For the first time, it’s software that is permanent, software that’s trustworthy, software that can exist outside of the control of their creator.”  That sentiment is not what sets Gharegozlou apart. Many people in crypto saw the same appeal. But it was Gharegozlou’s idea to illustrate that with something concrete, something fun, something even goofy. As far back as 2014, Gharegozlou wanted to build something on top of bitcoin. Then one of his lieutenants at Axiom, Dieter Shirley, spotted the answer in Ethereum. (Shirley, a former Apple engineer with a pointy beard on his chin, wasn’t too interested in the financial use cases of bitcoin, but when he discovered the smart contracts on the Ethereum network, he thought, “Okay, this is getting exciting now.”)  But what should they build on top of Ethereum? What would make sense? The team brainstormed for a month. They thought about real estate. They thought about insurance. They thought about mining. Not bitcoin mining – but “actual digging-in-the-ground mining,” said Shirley, as most mining companies don’t own the equipment, which means that cash needs to be locked up in escrow. But none of those answers felt right. One day, as they left yet another fruitless brainstorming meeting, Shirley’s co-worker, Mack Flavelle, turned to him and said, “We need to put cats on the blockchain.”  “What does that even mean?”  “I don’t know,” Flavelle said. “But we should figure this out.”  Gharegozlou soon gave the green light to a group of four people to spend a summer working on the wacky project of creating fake internet cats. The team included Kim Cope and Layne Lafrance, who remembers quitting her job in Hong Kong to join Axiom. She flew to Vancouver, and on her very first day, the group sat her down and said, “We think we’re going to put cats on the blockchain.”  “One hundred percent,” Lafrance immediately replied. “We need to put cats on the blockchain.”  She’s kind of joking but kind of not. No one had really tried something like that. Gharegozlou, who has a master’s degree from Stanford University in biological sciences, liked the idea of grounding blockchain in something that “we as biological beings understand.” A “distributed ledger” is boring. Cats are fun. Perhaps it’s not a coincidence that two of the biggest crypto projects to jump into the mainstream, dogecoin and CryptoKitties, are based on dogs and cats.  “We believe that blockchain is the future – but blockchain is about as approachable as a bunch of ones and zeros,” the CryptoKitties manifesto said at the time. “We’re not trying to build the future. We’re trying to have fun with it. The future is meow.”  Over the summer of 2017, Shirley, Lafrance, Cope and the team raced to bring the alpha version to ETHWaterloo, a hackathon in Canada. The product was crude. It had a “really ugly front end,” remembers Gharegozlou. They found a bunch of Pokemon cards, put pictures of cats on them, and handed them out to the geeks at the hackathon, saying, “Hey, these are cat collectibles. This is Pokemon, but for cats.”  A subtle but crucial point: Dapper’s alpha version was on a test network, meaning no money was involved. It didn’t cost anything to buy the cats. People couldn’t get rich off it. “There was no upside,” Gharegozlou said. “Those assets would never become valuable.”  None of that mattered. Or maybe it did in the sense that what happened next was even more amazing – the hackathon loved the ugly cats. “It was wildfire,” said Gharegozlou, who, after studying the initial user data, immediately doubled the team from six to 12. Days later, he bumped it to 18. They sprinted toward a public launch on Thanksgiving 2017.  And then they broke Ethereum. CryptoKitties went viral so fast that Ethereum traffic spiked by sixfold, the network clogged, users grumbled. The “genesis cat” sold for $113,000, which now looks like a bargain. Those splashy sales were mocked, and not everyone got it. “So now we have people using ether, an asset with arguably little tangible utility – to purchase an asset with unarguably zero tangible utility,” TechCrunch wrote at the time. “Welcome to the internet in 2017.”  CryptoKitties taught Dapper three lessons. First, and on the most obvious level, Ethereum was unable to scale “at the order of magnitude that was needed for mass adoption,” says Lafrance, who, in a detail so on-the-nose it almost feels staged, has a kitten on her lap during our Zoom call. (Lafrance still owns the very first CryptoKitty from the testnet days. The cat’s name is “The First.”)  The second lesson was more subtle, and possibly more important. Onboarding was a nightmare. “Asking people to upload their passport to try anything for the first time is just way too big of a barrier,” Lafrance says.  You had to open an account on Coinbase, and Coinbase could take a week to approve your account. Then you need to get a Chrome extension wallet from something called MetaMask. “Most people who do not work in this space do not know what a Chrome extension is,” Cope says. “It was just way too much friction for people,” and that’s before they considered something like Ethereum gas.  And the third lesson: “People were excited about the prospect of digital assets and what this meant, but they didn’t know how to apply it to their lives,” Lafrance says. Cats are cute … to a point. Especially for those outside the crypto-verse, most people didn’t really give a damn.  Dapper would need something else to truly connect. Something more personal. Something that people already knew and loved. Something with existing intellectual property.  Something with alley-oops, dunks, no-look passes and 2 billion fans worldwide.  # Hustle and FLOW  Before Gharegozlou wooed the NBA, he had always been a builder of what he calls “scrappy little things,” and that started in childhood. He was born in Tehran, Iran, his family moved to Dubai when he was six, then to Paris for high school and then to Stanford for college. “I never lived in the same place for more than six years,” says Gharegozlou, who speaks English, French, Farsi and conversational Italian and Spanish.  Read More: The Real Benefits of Blockchain Are Here. They’re Being Ignored by Roham Gharegozlou  All the moving around meant he had to constantly leave his friends behind. He was bored. “I was, like, let me go on the internet and see who’s there.” At age 11, he launched his first online business, way back in the mid-1990s, in the early days of AOL and Instant Messenger and “You’ve got mail.”  The kid slapped together a site that shared information on dogs. (He had an Irish Setter and used that as inspiration.) He added affiliate links to an up-and-coming site called Amazon.com. “It was the early days and there was so little content,” says Gharegozlou, who now has salt-and-pepper stubble and thick black hair. The kid went to Yahoo and submitted the dog page on the “Pets” section; usually it would be approved, and because there was so little competition, “it would be in the Top 10.”  His parents didn’t totally get it. “My dad barged into my room and said, ‘What are you doing? You’re still on the internet? How are you ever going to make money off this?’” Gharegozlou says that his father is a self-made man who “came from nothing” and dropped out of school at the age of 14 to sell chewing gum on the side of the street to support his family. The elder Gharegozlou grew that into a catering business and then a successful import/export business, and Roham Gharegozlou says he owes his work ethic to his father. “He just kept grinding.”  So 11-year-old Roham kept grinding by creating web pages for dogs, birds, cats (early foreshadowing of CryptoKitties) and even sites on places – Dubai, Iran, Paris. “Nobody knew I was in middle school,” Gharegozlou says. “It was the internet.”  Those early hustles, eventually, would lead him to launching Axiom, where he hired Shirley and expanded the team that would evolve into Dapper Labs. Soon the shift would be formalized. After the explosion of CryptoKitties, Gharegozlou was emboldened to take 50 of the 100 Axiom employees and spin it off as Dapper Labs, focusing only on blockchain. “We literally bet the business on crypto,” Gharegozlou says. “It was a big, big bet.” That baffled his colleagues. “For most of the last three or four years, my friends have been calling me telling me, ‘Hey, you’re working on this NFT (non-fungible token) thing? What’s wrong?’”  Dapper Labs was formed in March 2018. In April, it began courting the NBA, a partnership that Gharegozlou viewed as plausible for at least three reasons: the league’s younger fans gravitate toward highlights, trading cards were blowing up (and unlike physical cards, the smart contracts of Top Shots give the league a cut of secondary sales), and the NBA owners, widely praised as being “forward looking,” had already embraced gaming.  “The NBA, the NBA players, and the NBA owners are very savvy with this stuff,” Gharegozlou says. “They see the gamer mindset of digital assets, and that people are already spending close to $100 billion every year.”  It took Gharegozlou’s team over a year to close the deal with the NBA, but he says most of that time was answering the legal and operational questions. From a customer and fan perspective, “it was a slam dunk from the first day.”  The concept is one thing. But delivering it was something else. Shirley, Lafrance, Cope – now some of the only “NFT veterans” on the planet – knew they had to conquer those two crucial lessons they learned from CryptoKitties: 1) make it scale; 2) make it easy.  To tackle the first problem, Shirley knew he was out of the Ethereum business. They hunted for an alternative. Shirley’s team read more than 100 white papers. They talked to 20 teams of possible Ethereum alternatives. “But no one was building a blockchain with an eye for creating high-quality, consumer-facing applications,” Shirley says.  The plan was to use an existing blockchain product. That’s what they wanted to do. “I remember promising Roham, we’re not going to build a blockchain,” Lafrance says. “Everyone’s building a blockchain. We swear we’ll figure out something else.”  Then they built their own blockchain. They built Flow.  Flow is designed to be fast, scalable and cheap. To achieve that, they reimagined the role of the blockchain “nodes.” In Ethereum and other blockchains, every node is constantly validating the integrity of the system. Flow splits the nodes into four specialized jobs: collector nodes, execution nodes, verifier nodes and consensus nodes. That makes it dramatically faster.  Critics of Flow say it is too centralized, but Dapper says that its team now controls less than one-third of the nodes and that the system was built for the larger community. “Flow is not just for us,’ Shirley says. “What I don’t think people realize is that Flow is a completely re-architected blockchain, and the whole reason we built it was we want other people to build on top of it.”  That’s starting to happen. There are now 5,000 developers building on Flow, according to Dapper, creating projects such as Ballerz, Blockletes and Rarible. Method Man, the hip-hop artist who is also a comic book mega-geek, is using Flow to launch a NFT-fueled “comic universe” called Tical World.  As for the costs? As of this writing, the average gas fee on Ethereum is $128. The gas fee on Flow is less than a penny.  # Real Life and digital life  Flow solved the problem of scaling. But what about its other big learning from CryptoKitties, the headache of onboarding?  Gharegozlou faced a decision. At this point in 2018, the conventional wisdom – and really the entire ethos of crypto – was that projects should take a “non-custodial” approach to receiving payments. Users should retain the full power of their wallet and their private keys: “Not your keys, not your cheese.”  Dapper went the other way.  “What does this need to look and feel like?” Cope and her team asked. “At the end of the day, it needs to be an experience that’s similar to what they have already.” That meant online shopping. That meant e-commerce. Less Mt. Gox, more Apple. “Over time we can teach you and we can get you into crypto … but if I shove that in your face to start, I’ve already lost you,” says Cope, who’s now Dapper’s platform product lead.  Seed phrases? Gone. Credit cards? Accepted. (Dapper also offers a cryptocurrency and non-custodial way to buy and store NFTs; most people don’t use it.)  I started my stopwatch before buying my first Top Shot. It took only 2 minutes and 45 seconds to go from nothing – no account – to opening my first pack. That includes the time I spent selecting my favorite team (Houston Rockets), entering my payment options (credit card) and enabling two-factor authentication. It was nearly as smooth as buying something on Amazon. My starter pack cost $9.85.  The pack itself is inviting, with a little animation that jiggles, beckoning you to open it. Music plays in the background. Then you choose three cards to open – almost like how you scratch off a lottery ticket. I first opened a dunk by Andrew Wiggins, then a layup by Fecund Campazzo and finally a dunk by Kelly Oldnyk.  Every step of this user interface was meticulously engineered. To get inspiration during the design process, Top Shot product lead Arthur Camara and his team went on a buying spree of collectibles: baseball cards, Pokemon cards, even Tazos collectibles. In their Vancouver offices, they took turns opening the packs and soaking in the user experience. They watched unboxing videos on YouTube. They knew CryptoKitties had no “wow” moment of discovery. They would fix that.  For example, when you open up certain packs of Top Shot cards, when the moments are still sealed, a “shadow” appears over the most precious mystery card. “Users love that,” Camara says, and that detail was inspired by how when you open a pack of old-school trading cards and see that one of them has a different color foil, you save that one for last. The same thing happens with Top Shot. After extensive testing, Dapper found that users – just like in the offline world of baseball cards – saved that special shadow as something to savor.  Crypto purists might blanch at the custodial approach, but Spencer Dinwiddie, a point guard for the Washington Wizards, says that its ease of use is a big reason for the blazingly fast adoption. Dapper merged high-end technology with the lure of professional sports “in a way that didn’t trigger a massive consumer behavioral shift,” Dinwiddie wrote me over email, adding that “while blockchain is new to most, gaming is something that has played a role in all of our lives for centuries.”  Dinwiddie (who launched his own crypto product, a social token product called Calaxy) loved the idea so much that he became an investor. So did many of his peers. Dapper’s investors include not just the usual blockchain heavyweights like Andreessen Horowitz and Digital Currency Group (parent company of CoinDesk), but also former and current NBA players Michael Jordan, Andre Iguodala and Kevin Durant. By one estimate, Jordan and Durant tripled their investment in five months.  Dapper has raised $605 million and now has 341 full-time employees, about a third of whom work on Flow, a third on Dapper Wallet and a third on its growing lineup of sports products, which now includes partnerships with the National Football League, Women’s National Basketball Association and Ultimate Fighting Championship. They are expanding into decentralized autonomous organizations. They inked a partnership with LaLiga, the Spanish soccer league that includes blue-chip clubs like Barcelona and Real Madrid. To give a sense of scale, those two clubs alone have 61 million followers on Twitter, which is more than the entire NBA’s 35 million.  Roham doesn’t consider Top Shot a finished product. The moments continue to evolve. Lafrance, who’s now Flow’s product lead, says the company is constantly exploring the relationship between the “digital world” and the “physical world.” In the future, that could mean many things (i.e. the metaverse), but for now, it is starting with “challenges” that are pegged to real-life action in the NBA.  The day after Thanksgiving, for example, Top Shot issued a challenge: If you can assemble a “showcase” of six moments that include the top five rebounders from those day’s games, then you win another pack. Suddenly the way you watch the NBA changes. Imagine if you have a large collection of Top Shots that includes rebounding stalwarts like Clint Capela, Rudy Gobert and Nikola Jokic. On Nov. 26, you are gunning for your guys to finish in the top 5. It’s only a tiny hop from this to fantasy sports.  “The concept of creating a lineup, or creating a team … that’s something we actively explore,” Camara says. “I’m not saying we’re launching something tomorrow, but we actively explore those concepts.”  Reading between the lines (and this is just my inference), it sounds like the metaverse could be a big part of the road map. Lafrance concedes that “when we start dabbling in metaverse topics,” it could enable a new relationship between creators and fans and enable what she calls a “Cambrian explosion” of entirely new business models.  I don’t totally know what that means. Then again, no one totally knew what Gharegozlou was up to when creating CryptoKitties or NBA Top Shot. Without letting the cat out of the bag, Gharegozlou says that Dapper is involved with the metaverse in two ways. “The metaverse today is primarily closed,” he says, referring to platforms like Oculus or Roblox. He wants Dapper to help crack it open. “Open assets can go anywhere, even into closed worlds,” Gharegozlou says. A Top Shot moment of Giannis Antetokounmpo can jump from Fortnite into The Sandbox.  The second way is more intriguing. Gharegozlou says that Flow can be the “bottom platform for some of these worlds.” Flow has proven it can handle scaling rigors of NFTs with ease … so why not let it power the metaverse? That could be quietly underway. The metaverse of Matrix World, for example, launched a land sale in both Ethereum and Flow.  It’s possible that years from now, Top Shot will be seen the same way that we now look at CryptoKitties: a small stepping stone to something grander, something more profound. Could Dapper’s real killer app not be Top Shot, but a metaverse-enabling Flow? Just as CryptoKitties were a Trojan horse for the concept of NFTs, perhaps Top Shot will smuggle in a widespread adoption of a new virtual reality.  In the meantime, thanks to a product that brings a million-plus people joy (or at least amusement), you could make a credible case that Gharegozlou – and the team of Dapper – has done more to bring crypto to the mainstream than anyone since Satoshi Nakamoto.  Even if not everyone totally gets it.

This post is part of CoinDesk’s “Most Influential 2021″ series.  How is crypto going to change the world by 2030?  I think it will change how businesses are created, managed and funded. It will change personal and corporate banking. Trustless businesses will be perceived as better. We will use challenge-based optimistic rollups as part of trustless applications that handle insurance claims [and] applications for any number of things.  It will have the same impact on business and consumers as the internet did, if not more.  What was one lesson from this year?

Her media empire, The Defiant, which began as a daily newsletter giving a rundown of major DeFi news, has grown to encompass a team of writers and reporters, a voicey opinion section and some of the best produced video content about crypto. It has also expanded from a team of one to 17 people globally, from Tasmania to San Francisco. Taking a cue from her former employer, The Defiant has unveiled its “Defiant Terminal,” a data aggregator built for degens and institutions alike.  This post is part of CoinDesk’s “Most Influential 2021″ series.  How do you make sense of the year’s biggest trends in crypto?  Communities were crypto’s main asset in 2021. The stars of the year, NFTs, are about digital ownership, but they’re also (and sometimes primarily) an access pass to a specific community. DAOs are becoming powerful ways to organize capital and people. The metaverse is about finding a better way to interact online with others. Crypto Twitter organized to become a political force. We are just learning how powerful cryptocurrencies and smart contracts can rally people globally, and empower them to reach bigger and bigger goals.  How is crypto going to change the world by 2030?  Crypto is spurring a paradigm shift, where we’ll emerge from the current user-centric society, into an owner-centric society. Individuals all over the world will become users and owners of not only the applications they use, but also of the base layers on which they are built. Ownership means we’ll have greater control over our information and assets, the ability to benefit from the growth of the products we use online, and the right to participate in how those applications are run.

42424125,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2koBh,1638884700,DraftKings to Expand NFT Marketplace With NFLPA Partnership,"In just a matter of months, the National Football League has gone from being one of the least crypto-curious sports leagues to paving the way for mainstream adoption.  The latest development is a partnership between the NFL Players Association (NFLPA) and online sports betting giant DraftKings, which announced the collaboration on Tuesday.  The deal will grant licensing for players’ name, image and likeness rights to DraftKings for use on its NFT Marketplace beginning at the start of the NFL’s 2022-23 season.  DraftKings says it will use the licensing rights for a fantasy-style game where users can go head-to-head against each other using the non-fungible tokens they purchase for specific players, according to a press release.  The format is similar to that of the European NFT platform Sorare, which announced plans to enter American sports markets earlier this year.  Read more: European Football NFT Platform Sorare Raises $680M Series B  The partnership adds to the NFL’s growing list of NFT ventures, headlined by a deal with Dapper Labs to create a trading venue akin to NBA Top Shot. The NFL All Day platform on the Flow blockchain is expected to be released in the coming months.  The NFL also collaborated with Ticketmaster in November to release a series of team-specific NFT collections, with plans of tying tickets purchased for select NFL games with collectibles throughout the remainder of the season.  The deal with DraftKings was facilitated by OneTeam Partners, which is the official media business partner of the NFLPA.  “Few organizations beyond DraftKings are as equipped to capitalize on the increasing intersection between sports and NFTs that will be cornerstones of engagement and entertainment within Web 3,” said Beth Beiriger, senior vice president of product operations for DraftKings Marketplace. “We will continuously adapt, innovate and seek progressive collaborators like the NFLPA and OneTeam to reach early adopters among fan bases and ultimately introduce these next-generation products to the masses.”  Read more: Dapper Labs Is Bringing Its NFTs to the NFL  While similar fantasy sports projects have faced regulatory concerns regarding gambling laws, a representative from DraftKings told CoinDesk it has no worries that the company can operate within the rules to launch its platform across select states in the U.S.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | SPONSORED | FLOW,Eli Tan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/12/07/draftkings-to-expand-nft-marketplace-with-nflpa-partnership,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/851ec998abfcad90be7525cc473326616bd6636f-4564x3292.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42424127,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2koFh,1638870003,Blame the Bitcoin Bond? El Salvador’s Dollar-Denominated Debt Slides,"El Salvador’s dollar-denominated debt has taken a beating in recent weeks, with observers blaming President Nayib Bukele’s plan to issue bitcoin bonds for the sell-off. But there’s more to the decline than meets the eye.  “Salvador’s bond spreads to comparable U.S. treasuries have widened, and the bitcoin bonds are a contributing factor, but certainly not the only one,” Marc Ostwald, chief economist at London-based ADM Investors Services International, said in an email. “There has been a sharp widening of spreads between the emerging market bond yields and Treasury yields in the past two weeks and an uptick in yields on investment-grade and high-yielding bonds.”  Having adopted bitcoin as a legal tender in September, Bukele on Nov. 20 announced plans to build a “Bitcoin City” funded by the sale of a $1 billion bond carrying an annual coupon of 6.5%. Half of the funds of this so-called “volcano bond” will be used to accumulate bitcoin and the rest will be used for infrastructure and bitcoin mining powered by geothermal energy.  Since the announcement, El Salvador’s dollar bond maturing 2032 has slid from its high in May, sending the yield – which moves in the opposite direction to the price – above 17% from 6.3%, according to data provided by Boerse Frankfurt. That’s widened the spread above the 10-year U.S. Treasury note to more than 1,300 basis points from 480 in May. The country’s debt has begun trading in distressed territory, meaning it’s a security in default or likely to default.     To many observers, the widening of the spread over U.S. Treasurys, which are regarded as safe-haven investments, perhaps represents investor concerns that El Salvador’s increasing adoption of bitcoin will distance the country from the $1.3 billion loan agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The highly indebted nation needs to reach the agreement with the IMF to gain access to international markets ahead of major dollar bond payments due in 2023.  That said, the decline in El Salvador’s bonds also appears to be a part of a macro trend, as noted by Ostwald.  The gap between emerging-market bond yields and corresponding Treasury yields has doubled to 350 basis points in the past two weeks, as indicated by JPMorgan’s Emerging Market Bond Index Global Spread.  “Omicron, China property developers Evergrande and Kaisa Holdings default/restructing fears and concerns that faster Fed taper and rate hikes would tip the U.S. into recession are putting pressure on EM and high-yielding bond prices,” Ostwald said.  Demand for riskier assets has declined since Thanksgiving Day in the U.S., with a potentially more infectious COVID-19 variant sparking concerns of another wave of illness and renewed lockdowns, which could push major economies into stagflation – a situation characterized by low growth and high inflation.  To complicate matters, the U.S. Federal Reserve recently said it will be focusing more on restraining inflation and less on growth, forcing markets to price in the greater probability of a faster unwinding of crisis-era stimulus.  Looking ahead, the pain for Salvador’s dollar-denominated debt could worsen with bitcoin’s latest price slide. The cryptocurrency fell sharply over the weekend, hitting lows of under $43,000, and was last seen trading at nearly $51,100 – down 35% from the record high of nearly $69,000 reached on Nov. 10.  “Bitcoin’s drop definitely adds some pressure, as does thin year-end markets (credit, equity and commodities),” Ostwald said. Steve Hanke, an economist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, voiced similar opinion on Twitter, while drawing attention to widening El Salvador-U.S. yield spreads.  The attractiveness of El Salvador’s bitcoin bonds (ability to raise money) is tied to the cryptocurrency’s price prospects. That’s because by using half of the bond sale proceeds to purchase bitcoin, the government will be giving investors a share of the cryptocurrency’s possible price rally. According to Blockstream projections, the annualized yield could reach 146% in the 10th year, assuming the cryptocurrency rallies to $1 million in the next five years.
