42380883,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX90cAZ,1529359214,Cold Reception? Crypto Critics Ignite After EOS Blockchain 'Freeze',"You may have missed it, but over the weekend, transactions on the live EOS blockchain came to a complete – yet temporary – halt.  Coming less than 48 hours after the much-anticipated blockchain network went live, the announcement kicked off a social firestorm (not to mention a reported 5 percent drop in the value of the network's cryptocurrency).  Some background: the EOS launch, reported last week by CoinDesk, came at the end of a topsy-turvy period illustrated by last-minute code tweaks, an elaborate election of entities tasked with creating the network's transaction blocks, and, of course, the $4 billion EOS token sale.  So, it came as a surprise to some that the network would run into enough trouble that it triggered a failsafe network freeze. And unsurprisingly, critics of EOS were quick to pounce.  A patch to fix the issue was released and implemented less than five hours later.  However, in the fast-moving world of crypto, there was already damage done to the network's reputation.  That's not to say that EOS didn't have any commentators – or outright supporters – going to bat for it during the weekend debate. From a more supportive perspective, the weekend stoppage was seen largely as a growing pain and a symptom of a network controlled by no single entity, still getting its bearings so soon after launch.  Among the notable voices offering support to the project was Zcash creator Zooko Wilcox, who wrote ""kudos"" in the wake of the bug response.  Asked if he was joking, he was quite clear: the answer was no. EOS's response, in his eyes, was exemplary.  For others, the expectation of a ""perfect"" launch was an unrealistic one to begin with. And it's probably safe to say that some members of the EOS community aren't too concerned about the network stoppage, given the move to repair the bug.  An old debate made new  And while EOS blocks are moving once again, it's clear there's one thing not going anywhere: the debate over the degree of centralization on the network.  What's being debated, in a broader sense, is the extent to which EOS is immune to the actions of one particular group or entity – the more centralized it is toward one of those groups, the more likely it is to face problems if that group has issues, dissolves or is attacked.  For EOS, the centralization risks are unique – and put on display thanks to the weekend issue.  EOS block producers are the only ones who can validate transactions on the blockchain. They are voted on by other users, and the votes are weighted by the number of tokens staked.  As a result, though the mainnet platform is not owned by any singular authority, these block producers act as de facto leaders able to make executive decisions on proposed changes, or in this case, fixes to the network.  Since the design inception, critics have been concerned of the centralized power of block producers and now with the latest issued upgrade, 1.0.5., they have a real case of that power in action.  In response to the criticism, EOS maintains its distribution of tokens and block producers remain far from centralized, pointing to the global distribution of block producers.

Nishiawakura – a village of approximately 1,500 people in the Okayama prefecture in Japan – revealed its plan last week to launch a regional initial coin offering as a way to secure funding. The municipality, in particular, relies on forestry to support its economy - about 95 percent of the town is made up of forest area, according to the village's official announcement.  Nishiawakura Coin (NAC) will be issued by Nishiawakura's Token Economy Association. While the launch date has not yet been released, some details about the coin can be found on its official website.  The village launched the effort after its leaders saw ICOs being widely used around the globe by companies and non-governmental organizations, Nikkei reported on June 16. Officials also took note that the country is moving ahead with the establishment of self-regulatory rules regarding the blockchain funding model.  In its release, the village quoted Yoichi Ochiai, a Japanese researcher and cryptocurrency author, who claimed that future local governments in Japan ""will move away from centralization and make an aggressive investment in ICOs.""  This is not the first instance of municipal interest in ICOs worldwide. As previously reported by CoinDesk, the mayor of the Louisiana city of Lafayette pitched an ICO to raise cash.

In a legal advisory released Mondayhttps://www.oge.gov/web/oge.nsf/All+Advisories/8B9F1457621B11B7852582B00048F870/$FILE/LA-18-06.pdf?open, the U.S. Office of Government Ethics (OGE) clarified that cryptocurrency is ""property held … for investment or the production of income"" instead of a ""real"" currency or legal tender. As a result, the OGE will now require executive branch employees to report holdings of digital currencies because they ""may create a conflict of interest for employees who own it.""  The disclosure requirement is a major move, requiring members of the U.S. executive branch – officials working for the White House as well as the galaxy of federal agencies – to reveal their crypto holdings. Earlier this year, a member of the U.S. Congress submitted a petition seeking similar requirements for federal lawmakers.  The OGE's document also specifically makes mention of initial coin offerings, or the sale of tokens prior to the launch of a particular network.  ""Further, the reporting and conflict of interest principles set forth herein apply equally to other digital assets, such as 'coins' or 'tokens' received in connection with initial coin offerings or issued or distributed using distributed ledger or blockchain technology,"" the OGE wrote.  While the document doesn't establish when the process began, the OGE indicated that it moved to craft the guidance because government officials have been "" increasingly seeking guidance from their ethics officials concerning their financial disclosure reporting obligations.""  Notably, the OGE suggested that Monday's release may not be the final word on the subject. In the future, officials wrote, actions by other government agencies could put the guidance in doubt and require further study.  ""Given the evolving nature of virtual currency, other regulatory agencies may issue additional findings or guidance that provide further insight into how these assets should be treated for the purposes of the EIGA,"" the OGE said.

According to The Korea Times on Monday, the BoK said that issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC) could pose a ""moral hazard"" by adversely affecting monetary policy and its implementation, and possibly causing instability in the market as it effectively doesn't function like fiat money.  More than that, the Bank of Korea (BoK) went as far as to say that ""digital currencies do not perform as money,"" in a new report.  While the central bank set out to examine the feasibility of using digital currencies as currency, ""our thoughts are that digital currencies have been exposed to various categories of risk associated with credit, liquidity and legal management,"" said Kwon Oh-ik, a BoK economist, in the report.  Looking more widely, the unrestricted issuance of both traditional and digital currencies could bring ""social costs and undermine social welfare,"" the paper warns, adding:  ""It's desirable that the BoK is the only entity to entirely control the issuing of money.""  The central bank isn't entirely negative on CBDCs, however, saying that they could ""revolutionize"" the banking system. Even so, they would need to be rigorously tested before being approved.  The paper also recommends the regulation of private issuance of digital currencies, according to Yonhap, adding that the government should impose a tax on issuers to make them less likely to exaggerate the value of their holdings.  ""Technology improvements don't mean private sectors will be allowed to have the rights for money issuance. If this happens, the BoK should regulate them but properly,"" Kwon said.  The central bank has been studying the possibility of a CBDC and how cryptocurrencies might influence the financial sector since January, when it set up a task-force to research the technology.

The move is ""a natural fit"" for the organization, which aims to support journalists reporting on issues within governments, said executive director Trevor Timm.  FPF – which will now accept bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ethereum, litecoin and zcash – currently has digital wallets available for direct donations, he said, although the aim is to ultimately utilize a payment processor to automatically convert the donations into fiat currency.  Decentralized technology is a tool that can help prevent online censorship, as well as prevent surveillance by certain parties, according to Timm. The decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies, in particular, can mitigate the risk of ""financial censorship"" by the relatively small number of traditional payment processors that currently hold a ""monopoly"" on fund transfers, he stated.  Timm told CoinDesk:  ""If cryptocurrencies can lead to more awareness about anti-censorship, and also make it easier for potential supporters to support non-profits like Freedom of the Press Foundation, then I hope many other similar organizations follow suit in the coming months and years.""  ""We live in a time when journalists around the world have never been at greater risk of surveillance, arrest, or worse, and it's incredibly important that supporters of press freedom have all the available options to them to fight back,"" he said.  Perhaps in recognition of that mission, blockchain startup Mainframe has already made the first crypto donation, sending 1,000 ether (around $498,000 at press time) to the foundation.  Timm said that the funds would allow the FPF, which notably has NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden on its board, to expand its work, adding that ""hopefully it might even inspire others to donate.""

Origin co-founder Josh Fraser said that, more important than the money, will be the opportunity to grow its network with endorsement from CoinList, an AngelList spin-off. The startup wants ""as many people to participate as possible,"" he told CoinDesk.  Fraser continued:  ""There's so many scammy projects out there, so anything you can do to set yourself apart is [great] … We're really excited for a chance to work with CoinList and to be able to be the recipient of a very anticipated sale. If you look in our Telegram, you see people asking every single day to be a part.""  That being said, only accredited investors will be able to buy into Origin on CoinList's platform at the moment. The co-founder explained that ""while not everyone can participate yet, it goes a long way to allowing more people to participate.""  Origin will use the funds to further flesh out its blockchain. And while it isn't in urgent need of new funds – having already raised $28 million in a SAFT sale and $3 million in a prior venture capital round – the startup still intends to make good use of the sale proceeds, according to Fraser.  ""We're going to continue building as we said we're going to do, and we're on schedule to launch [in the third quarter] like we said we would,"" he said.  Fraser noted that the fundamental question the company is asking is whether open-source protocols could replace ""not one, not two, but dozens of major companies.""

42380858,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8zlLp,1529323253,Not Sold On Blockchains for Business? Just You Wait,"Paul Brody is a principal and the global blockchain leader at EY      We were promised a global financial and industrial revolution. We got a mango tracker.  Three years since enterprises started exploring the possibilities in blockchain, it's perfectly understandable to be disappointed with what we've got so far.  But believe it or not, the seemingly banal applications for blockchain we're seeing, from food traceability to software licenses, are a big deal and rightly worth celebrating.  The biggest journeys take place one step at a time, and when it comes to enterprises, it's a particularly long journey. That 22,000-word software license agreement you clicked ""yes"" to without reading? Enterprises are reading every word of those things and arguing over the details. Adoption of technology inside the enterprise is sticky and durable, but it is also very slow as these systems are fragile and have many decision makers.  If you want to beg forgiveness rather than ask for permission a la Uber, that's your call. If you want to put a Fortune 500 company's cars into an asset-sharing system, be prepared to spend the next year locked up with the legal team.  As important as the milestones achieved so far have been, there's a much longer way to go and in this series of articles, I will examine the key transformations that need to take place for blockchains to go from interesting prototypes to production systems solving niche problems to general-purpose tools for moving value of all kinds around.  We're just transitioning from the interesting prototype into the niche problem-solving category, with things like food and wine traceability and software licenses leading the way as good case examples.  Going public...  Right now, nearly all enterprise blockchain examples are confined to private networks and, typically, non-financial systems. To get from niche use cases to general-purpose transactions suitable for all businesses, four transitions must happen.  The first is a shift from private, permissioned blockchains to their chaotic, public and permissionless counterparts. Like the move from private company systems to the internet, it looks scary now, but in a few years, we will all look back upon it as inevitable.  There's a good reason, however, that nearly all enterprise solutions today run on private networks: privacy. Public, permissionless blockchains, though they are based on key principles of cryptography, actually run most data in the ""clear"" – which is to say unencrypted. If you want to buy raw materials from suppliers and partners and you do so over the public networks like ethereum today, your pricing deals and volumes and partners will all be easily visible to your competition. Not very attractive.  And so companies have opted for private networks. But private networks, even industry consortia, don't scale very well. If you form a private network for food traceability and you want to ship the food and insure that shipment, you'll end up needing half a dozen different blockchain connections to complete the whole transaction.  Some companies are working hard on connecting up lots of different private blockchains. That's going to be expensive and our fear is that hackers will have a field day with those interoperable systems. This isn't a strategy that has worked in other industries and eras, and we don't see it having a better fate this time around either.  If you've been around long enough, you remember when companies had point-to-point connections for their email systems. It worked, just barely, but only for a few companies to talk to each other.  ...while keeping data private  The internet and public key encryption made it possible for us to email everyone, everywhere securely without any predefined interconnections. With zero knowledge proofs, we believe the same will be possible for blockchain transactions.  This technology, which has been proven in a number of prototypes, is now being industrialized. It will allow all companies to work on public blockchains and to enter into contracts with each other securely and privately.  The mathematical principles that underpin zero-knowledge proofs are very complex, but the effect is very simple. I can prove to you something is true (e.g. I have a certain number of mangos, or I have delivered them to a certain customer or location) without enabling anyone else to understand the underlying data.  This means you can preserve the immutability and redundancy of a blockchain by allowing anyone to verify the truth of information and approve a transaction – something that is critical to consensus algorithms in decentralized systems – without exposing the details for all to see.  The same scenario we discussed before (buying product, shipping it, insuring it and tracking it and paying for it) can not only be done with a single contract with multiple parties, it can all take place on the same blockchain and be executed securely, privately and reliably.  Getting on to a shared, public infrastructure is critical for blockchains to scale globally and to move from very specific industry solutions into general purpose tools for moving value and enabling business agreements.  Though we think it will take some time to fully industrialize the implementation of zero-knowledge proofs, the payoff will enormous.  In my next article, I will take a look at the second key revolution we expect in blockchain technology: the transition from notarization to tokenization.

42380859,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8zlOL,1529316036,Bitcoin Recovery Stalls Raising Risk of Price Drop,"Bitcoin (BTC) is once more facing a drop to (or below) $6,000, with both short- and long-duration charts being aligned in favor of the bears.  The cryptocurrency found acceptance above the key resistance of $6,425 (April 1 low) in the second half of last week, raising the prospects of a corrective rally towards the $7,000 mark.  Further, while a fall to $6,000 following a bear flag breakdown on Friday seemed likely, losses were unexpectedly cut short at $6,300, signaling bearish exhaustion.  Yet, the leading cryptocurrency did not find any takers over the weekend, leaving trading flat-lined above $6,500.  Courtesy of the drop from $6,573 (Sunday's high) to $6,370 (today's low), the short duration charts have now turned bearish. Meanwhile, the long duration charts continue calling a bearish move.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $6,430 on Bitfinex – down 1.3 percent over 24 hours and is looking southwards.  4-hour chart  BTC's drop to $6,370 earlier today confirmed a downside break of the pennant – a bearish continuation pattern indicating the sell-off from the high of $7,638 has resumed.  As a result, the cryptocurrency could slide to $5,820 (target as per the measured height method, i.e. the difference between the pennant high and low subtracted from the breakdown price).  The moving averages (MAs) are also biased bearish, with the 50-candle, 100-candle and 200-candle MAs all trending south.  Further, the relative strength index (RSI) is struggling to rise above 50.00 (into bullish territory).  Daily chart  BTC remains trapped inside a falling channel, the RSI remains below 50.00 (in bearish territory) and the 10-day MA is falling (bearish).  Weekly chart  The 5-week and 10-week MAs are losing altitude, signaling a bearish setup and adding credence to the pennant breakdown.  The 10-week MA is about to cross the 50-week MA from above (bearish crossover) for the first time since September 2015.  View  BTC will likely test $6,000 this week and could extend losses further towards $5,820.  On the higher side, a convincing break above $6,618 (resistance seen in 4-hour chart) would open up upside towards the 5-week MA, currently located at $6,943.  Only a weekly close above $7,959 (50-week MA) would abort the long-term bearish view.

""The early phases of Factom's work has informed architecture choices and design decisions inherent in integrating blockchain with existing technologies,"" said Anil John, Identity Management Research and Development Program Manager at the DHS Science and Technology Directorate, in a news release. ""In Phase IV, Factom will deploy this technology in a realistic field environment with Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to understand its operational impacts.""  Factom, a Texas-based startup, is working on a technology that integrates data collected by the sensors and cameras onto a blockchain, securing data and eliminating the opportunity to spoof, modify or disrupt it, according to the release. Factom's product will be tested in an environment with limited internet connectivity and variable weather conditions to gauge its performance in a live Border Patrol scenario.  The funding is a fourth tranche of a grant provided to Factom by the DHS in the course of its Silicon Valley Innovation Program, which allows tech companies to apply for $800,000 in funds over a 24-month period.  Currently 23 companies, including Factom, are in process of developing their solutions for DHS with assistance from its grants, incorporating technologies such as the internet of things, unmanned aircraft systems, cybersecurity solutions for financial services, global travel assessment systems, airport passenger processing and wearable technologies.  As reported by CoinDesk, Factom received $200,000 from the DHS in 2016 to begin developing the current project.  ""The Factom piece is more along the line of: these devices exist, but how do we build a picture of the identity of this device over time? The blockchain could be the catalyst that allow us to document the changes,"" John explained.  Factom has made several successful fundraising efforts over the last three years, raising $1.1 million in a crowdsale in 2015 and then, later that year, $400,000 in seed funding. October 2016 saw $4.2 million raised, followed by over $8 million in an extended Series A round last April.

42380860,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8zlKZ,1529305230,Halt the Internet? BIS Report Critiques Blockchain and DLT Claims,"A financial institution operated by the world's central banks is taking aim at cryptocurrencies, questioning their ability to deliver on their promise in a new report published Sunday morning.  The document, titled ""Cryptocurrencies: looking beyond the hype"" and released by the Bank of International Settlements (BIS), explains the history behind the technology and analyzes whether it can truly creating a trustless form of money. As previously reported, the release precedes the organization's full annual economic report, which will be published next week.  Citing hard forks, mining concentration, the proliferation of new cryptocurrencies, volatile markets and scalability as issues with cryptocurrencies at present, the bank's report concludes that "" the decentralized technology of cryptocurrencies, however sophisticated, is a poor substitute for the solid institutional backing of money.""  In addition, the bank claims that using a blockchain to process the volume of retail payments made daily ""could bring the internet to a halt.""  The report explains:  ""To process the number of digital retail transactions currently handled by selected national retail payment systems, even under optimistic assumptions, the size of the ledger would swell well beyond the storage capacity of a typical smartphone in a matter of days, beyond that of a typical personal computer in a matter of weeks and beyond that of servers in a matter of months.""  Beyond storage capacity, the report claims that ""only supercomputers"" possess the processing power needed to conduct every retail transaction on a blockchain, and even if there were sufficient supercomputers to create a decentralized network, ""millions of users [would] exchange files on the order of a magnitude of a terabyte.""  This massive communication volume is what would impact the internet, according to the report.  The report also takes shots at miners, noting that ""delivering ... hinges on a set of assumptions: that honest miners control the vast network of computing power, that users verify the history of all transactions and that the supply of the currency is predetermined by a protocol.""  While the BIS was harsh on cryptocurrencies, it saw distributed ledgers more positively, writing that ""the underlying technology may have promise in other fields.""  Distributed ledger technology can facilitate cross-border payments, as well as help niche fields ""where the benefits of decentralized access exceed the higher operating cost of maintaining multiple copies of the ledger.""  However, the report ultimately noted that research in other technologies to accomplish the same goals as a distributed ledger is ongoing, ""and it is not clear which will emerge as the most efficient one.""

42380850,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8zlAV,1529292613,Metropolitan Bank Is Handling Millions for Crypto Clients (And It Wants More),"To most banks in the U.S., cryptocurrency businesses are pariahs. To Metropolitan Commercial Bank, they're ""pioneers.""  At least, that's how the New York financial institution's chief technology officer, Nick Rosenberg, describes them.  ""We're certainly very interested in growing this vertical,"" Rosenberg told CoinDesk of the bank's crypto clientele. ""We've learned that it's a serious industry. There are some very smart people involved. There are some very interesting ideas coming out that could really change the way people do business.""  While most banks cling to the adage ""blockchain not bitcoin,"" Metropolitan stands out simply by being one of the very few to enthusiastically court deposit business from crypto firms.  These clients include a few exchanges, as well as hedge funds and other crypto investors that bank at Metropolitan because it's easier to quickly move their money to those exchanges. (To be clear: the bank only handles fiat for customers and does not touch crypto itself.)  So far, it's proven a lucrative niche for Metropolitan. In the first quarter, cash management and foreign exchange conversion fees from cryptocurrency clients totaled $3.4 million, the bank disclosed in an investor presentation. This helped drive a more than 300 percent increase from a year earlier in Metropolitan's total non-interest income, to $5.4 million, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing.  If that doesn't sound like a lot of money, keep in mind that Metropolitan is a community bank. With just $1.9 billion in total assets, it's less than one-1,000th the size of JPMorgan.  What's more, that triple-digit rate of growth is astronomical for the U.S. banking industry, where non-interest income for all institutions climbed a measly 7.9 percent during the same period, according to data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.  Yet despite the lucrative demand from crypto companies for banks to provide fiat liquidity and other traditional services, bitcoin-friendly banks like Metropolitan are still as rare as they were three years ago.  ""It's extremely challenging,"" said Joe Ciccolo, president of the compliance service provider BitAML Inc. Referring to another sector that banks have famously shunned, he added:  ""The legalized cannabis industry are having a much easier time than our cryptocurrency clients.""  'High-touch relationship'  One reason Metropolitan Bank is an outlier in embracing the crypto industry is that most banks can't stomach the risks. Chief among them is the regulatory risk.  Anti-money-laundering regulations require banks to identify their customers and even their customers' customers, plus track the flow of funds. While public blockchains can help banks and law enforcement trace the movement of money, the pseudonymous nature of crypto addresses makes it hard to determine who is ultimately sending and receiving funds.  Bitcoin's historical association with underground drug markets certainly doesn't help.  ""It's very difficult for a bank to maintain a pro-bitcoin stance,"" said Ciccolo, citing the high turnover among compliance officers. ""If you have a new officer come into a financial institution, they may take the opportunity to put a different stance on high-risk customers such as crypto companies.""  As bullish as they may be, Metropolitan's bankers still recognize the risks of working with crypto clients. ""It's a high-touch relationship,"" Rosenberg said, meaning one requiring extra diligence.  With regard to risk management, Rosenberg said there are two crucial keys to serving crypto clients.  The first is being extremely selective about client acquisition, only working with companies that take compliance as seriously as the bank does. The second is maintaining an open dialogue with regulators.  ""Law enforcement departments, in general, are understanding that cryptocurrency is not all about illicit payments, it has a value and it has a legitimate purpose,"" Rosenberg said. ""It's just a matter of spending time explaining it, understanding what their concerns are, making them feel comfortable that we are mitigating those concerns, and that we have the right controls in place.""  Other risks  Compliance aside, Metropolitan also has to insulate itself from the volatility its cryptocurrency customers live with every day. As noted above, the bank only works with fiat currency like dollars, never touching cryptocurrency directly.  But more subtly, it's minimized the risk to its own balance sheet in the event crypto depositors' balances suddenly shrink. To illustrate why this would be a concern, the settlement accounts it maintains for exchanges totaled $281.2 million on March 31, representing 17.4 percent of the bank's total deposits, according to the SEC filing.  Such a high concentration might normally be worrisome.  However, Metropolitan isn't using these accounts to fund long-term assets like mortgages, just cash and equivalents. So, even if they were drained at once, it's far from a run on the bank.  ""They do not utilize a lot of these deposits in their everyday operations, just because they do know there is significant volatility there,"" said Collyn Gilbert, an analyst and managing director at the investment banking firm Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.  To be sure, Metropolitan held another $100.8 million in corporate accounts for cryptocurrency firms, making up 6.2 percent of total deposits as of March 31. And these accounts do fund assets on the balance sheet.  But corporate accounts, which clients use for normal business activities like payroll, are less volatile than settlement accounts, which hold money only temporarily until a transaction is completed, Gilbert said.  Yet there's one more risk Metropolitan has encountered in the crypto space: what finance types call ""headline risk.""  In January, the bank sent its customers a reminder of what it said was a longstanding policy of not accepting crypto-related wire transfers from entities outside the U.S. Word leaked out to the press, which reported this was a new policy prompted by fraud. Metropolitan had to issue a public denial of that claim to quell backlash.  Reaping rewards  Setting aside the fee income and interest-free funding on deposits, there's a more intangible benefit Metropolitan gains from banking cryptocurrency firms, one that arguably compensates for all the risks.  Namely, it gets a front-row seat to the revolution and is learning about how cryptocurrencies perform in the wild.  ""I think Metropolitan was intrigued by the structure, more than just bitcoin, but the structure of that currency market in general,"" Gilbert said. ""The technology behind it is what has really been intriguing to this management team.""  Ciccolo agreed that serving this sector has given Metropolitan a competitive advantage.  ""There's a dual benefit for those banks that are willing to step out there,"" he said. ""Not only does it present a new book of business their competitors don't have, so they can grow their customer base and reach, at the same time, it also gives them a sneak peek at some of the technology that might be impacting their world in traditional finance.""  Indeed, the bank's director of new products, Kyle Hingher, said Metropolitan hopes to someday be one of the leading banks serving the emerging token economy, once the opaque regulatory landscape clears up.  ""We're looking at this market as a new asset class,"" Hingher said. ""We'd like to do more for the new asset class.""  For now, of course, even companies with cypherpunk ideals benefit from working with traditional banks to tap into audiences and services that utilize fiat currencies. Liquidity lends any crypto startup greater usability.  ""If something is really going to succeed, it's going to require a banking partnership,"" Hingher said.  Looking ahead, the Metropolitan banker is keeping close tabs on the emergence of security tokens and blockchain-based settlement systems.  ""The opportunity is to merge technologies and that potential for something brand new that could be earth-shattering and change everything. The potential for that, I think, outweighs all the crash-and-burn scenarios,"" Hingher told CoinDesk, concluding:  ""We call ourselves the entrepreneurial bank. We want to work with this new space rather than butting heads.""

CoinDesk has learned the graphics card producer, which saw a headlines-grabbing business boost from crypto mining demand last year, is now working with a startup called Ubex to develop a smart online marketing platform that uses blockchain and artificial intelligence.  Abhinav Agrawal, a spokesperson for the startup, told CoinDesk that Nvidia accepted Ubex into its Inception Program earlier this month. Ubex wants to use the technology to help a neural network - a type of computer program designed to think like a person - more efficiently present advertisements on websites.  Essentially, the startup is seeking to use blockchain to underpin its service, with data stored in a distributed ledger system helping the network target ads at consumers.  Ubex co-founder and chief executive Artem Chestnov told CoinDesk that the startup uses a blockchain in particular because its ""key goal is transparency and speed of transactions.""  He continued:  ""Any AI needs datasets to work more effectively and to learn. Training an AI requires a lot of effort. The blockchain base will allow us to attract thousands of sources of information that will be used to enrich our AI's database and make it faster, smarter, stronger and more efficient.""  At present, the startup has released a prototype of its platform for testing.  The Nvidia Inception Program seeks to provide data science and artificial intelligence startups with resources to finish developing and market their products, according to its website. Agrawal told CoinDesk that these resources include educational and marketing tools, as well as datasets for training the startup's neural network.  Nvidia Inception Program head Arjun Dutt confirmed that Ubex is part of the incubation program, but said its use of blockchain ""was not a significant factor in our consideration."" Rather, it's Ubex's planned application that caught the company's eye.  ""The main area of interest is their use of deep learning [and] neural networks for better online advertising algorithms,"" he said.
