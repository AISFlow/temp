42407166,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAfF1R6,1392578596,What is the Difference Between Litecoin and Bitcoin?,"In 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto launched bitcoin as the world’s first cryptocurrency. The code is open source, which means it can be modified by anyone and freely used for other projects. Many cryptocurrencies have launched with modified versions of this code, with varying levels of success.      Litecoin was announced in 2011 with the goal of being the 'silver' to bitcoin's 'gold'. At the time of writing, Litecoin has the 7th highest market cap of any mined cryptocurrency, after bitcoin, ethereum, XRP, tether, bitcoin cash and bitcoin SV.      Here's our guide to show you the crucial difference between bitcoin and litecoin.

Litecoin was created in October 2011 by former Google engineer Charles Lee. The motivation behind its creation was to improve upon bitcoin. The key difference for end-users being the 2.5 minute time to generate a block, as opposed to bitcoin’s 10 minutes. Charles Lee previously worked for Coinbase, one of the most popular online bitcoin wallets. He now dedicates his time to the Litecoin Foundation.      For miners and enthusiasts though, litecoin holds a much more important difference to bitcoin, and that is its different proof of work algorithm. Bitcoin uses the SHA-256 hashing algorithm, which involves calculations that can be greatly accelerated in parallel processing. It is this characteristic that has given rise to the intense race in ASIC technology, and has caused an exponential increase in bitcoin's difficulty level.      Litecoin, however, uses the scrypt algorithm – originally named as s-crypt, but pronounced as 'script'. This algorithm incorporates the SHA-256 algorithm, but its calculations are much more serialised than those of SHA-256 in bitcoin. Scrypt favours large amounts of high-speed RAM, rather than raw processing power alone. As a result, scrypt is known as a 'memory hard problem'.      The consequences of using scrypt mean that there has not been as much of an 'arms race' in litecoin (and other scrypt currencies), because there is (so far) no ASIC technology available for this algorithm. However, this is soon to change, thanks to companies like Alpha Technologies, which is now taking preorders.      To highlight the difference in hashing power, at the time of writing, the total hashing rate of the bitcoin network is over 20,000 Terra Hashes per second, while litecoin is just 95,642 Mega Hashes per second.      For the time being, 'state of the art' litecoin mining rigs come in the form of custom PCs fitted with multiple graphics cards (ie: GPUs). These devices can handle the calculations needed for scrypt and have access to blisteringly fast memory built into their own circuit boards.      There was a time when people could use GPU mining for bitcoin, but ASICs have made this method not worth the effort.    Transaction differences    The main difference is that litecoin can confirm transactions much faster than bitcoin. The implications of that are as follows:    Litecoin can handle a higher volume of transactions thanks to its faster block generation. If bitcoin were to try to match this, it would require significant updates to the code that everyone on the bitcoin network is currently running.  The disadvantage of this higher volume of blocks is that the litecoin blockchain will be proportionately larger than bitcoin's, with more orphaned blocks.  The faster block time of litecoin reduces the risk of double spending attacks – this is theoretical in the case of both networks having the same hashing power.  A merchant who waited for a minimum of two confirmations would only need to wait five minutes, whereas they would have to wait 10 minutes for just one confirmation with bitcoin.    Transaction speed (or faster block time) and confirmation speed are often touted as moot points by many involved in bitcoin, as most merchants would allow zero-confirmation transactions for most purchases. It is necessary to bear in mind that a transaction is instant, it is just confirmed by the network as it propagates.",NEUTRAL,LTC,BCH | LTC | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | BTG,"CoinDesk, Hoa Nguyen",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/what-is-the-difference-between-litecoin-and-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/765d53f5413db72ab0a3fc104d1584ef456c0f8e-1024x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425446,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyI1rRh,1392559982,itBit Offers Incentives for Bitcoin Traders to Switch Exchanges,"Singapore-based exchange itBit recently built a trading-specific platform for bitcoin; now it is offering a cut-price promotion in an attempt to draw in new customers.  The company has not had any of the problems that other exchanges have been experiencing lately. In fact, itBit CEO Rich Teo has said that recent events have led to increased interest in his company’s platform.  “Based on the way our wallet is built, we weren’t affected. We haven’t seen any issues,“ he said.  Near the end of last year, itBit received $3.2m in venture capital, bringing its funding total to $5.5m.  Cold storage  Some exchanges have been struggling with transactional problems, but itBit’s cold (offline) bitcoin storage methods have allowed the company to avoid these issues altogether. Teo said:  “No customer coins are ever exposed to a hot wallet.”  “At itBit, bitcoin and fiat deposits and withdrawals are business as usual,” said Antony Lewis, business development manager for the exchange.  “For withdrawals, we enforce a 72-hour withholding period,” Lewis said. “This can be reduced to 24-hours at a user’s request, if they enable multi-factor login authentication.”  These waiting times are for user security purposes, which is something itBit takes seriously. The company provides a flow chart that shows how it handles transactions and the processes that are in place to protect investors.  “Although some clients say they don’t like this, it gives them protection against unauthorized withdrawals,” Lewis explained.  Free trades  Because the company believes its secure bitcoin storage features will attract customers shaken by the recent events at other exchanges, itBit is doing a promotion – waiving some commissions for new customers  “We are giving out trading credits so people can essentially trade for free,” Teo said. “If you deposit over $10,000 worth of BTC or currency, then we’ll provide you with a $50 trading credit.”  For customers who deposit between $5,000 and 10,000 there will be a $25 trading credit, while those who fund their account with $2,000-$5,000 will get a $10 credit.  itBit is currently attempting to get money transmitter business (MSB) licensing in the 48 US states that require it. Because of this, it is only accepting US banking customers who reside in New Mexico or South Carolina, because these are jurisdictions where state MSB licensure is not required.  An alternative for customers in the US is to wire itBit money from an offshore bank account. Many US-based customers, who Teo terms as ""institutional"", go this route. “We also don’t charge any withdrawal fees or any transaction fees,” Teo pointed out.  Big in Asia  Teo says that itBit has a diverse and global clientele, and it has a large customer base in the Asia region. itBit has proved very popular with traders in Singapore, Hong Kong, China and Australia.  While most customers are trading in US dollars, the euro and the Singapore dollar are also available trading pairs.  itBit’s 15-person headquarters is sited in Singapore, but the company has offices in New York and Shanghai as well.  Teo used to work in the finance industry in New York, and he believes the city will be important for cryptocurrencies.  “We do have a very New York-based background. We think that New York will play a role in digital currencies over the next decade.”  The company is hoping to expand its reach to mainland China soon. Yuan-to-BTC trading is not available on itBit at the moment, and will not be within the next few months. However, it is “something that we want to do,” according to Teo.  The exchange’s waived-fee promotion, called the Rebate & Reward Program, will last until February 16. (See also itBit’s announcement concerning malleable transactions.)

42425444,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyI1rPh,1392555563,Bitcoin Regulation in the UK,"Eitan Jankelewitz is a technology lawyer at the law firm Sheridans. He provides commercial legal advice to all kinds of technology businesses, including some operating in the bitcoin economy.  In this article, Jankelewitz explains how UK regulation applies to bitcoin and other digital currencies. He also describes the approach to compliance generally taken by UK businesses.  The UK, especially London, is considered a global centre for financial services and new technologies.  You might assume, therefore, that the UK would be a great adoptive home for bitcoin and other digital currencies. Digital currency is, after all, the ultimate example of a finance/technology hybrid. Well, you would be right.  The British public has shown keen interest in digital currencies – the London bitcoin meetup is possibly the biggest in the world and there are numerous other events and meetings being held in cities up and down the UK.  Britain is also home to some of the world’s most popular bitcoin products and services. Despite this, the UK’s government and regulators have been remarkably quiet on the subject of digital currencies, and have left the development and adoption of digital currencies largely unacknowledged.  There are three areas of regulation to consider when examining this subject: consumer protection; the prevention of money laundering, and taxation. Foreign regulations also have certain implications for those operating in the UK.  Consumer protection  In the UK, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is the regulator with responsibility for ensuring that financial services are provided in a way that protects consumers and maintains the integrity of the market. The FCA regulates businesses that provide financial services or promote financial services (whether retail or wholesale).  In the last year, a number of bitcoin businesses have approached the FCA seeking clarification on the legalities of operating bitcoin exchanges.  However the FCA has not offered any constructive guidance or comment on the regulation of digital currencies. In fact, the FCA has gone as far as stating it does not regulate digital currencies and has no intention of doing so. The result is that bitcoin businesses in the UK are not obliged to register with or be authorised by the FCA.  The UK has a well-established tradition of self-regulation. Despite the regulator's approach, a number of bitcoin businesses have told me that they act in accordance with FCA rules, even though they are not required to do so.  Without any formal guidance, businesses act on their own interpretation of what the rules ought to be. As a result, an unusual scenario has arisen: instead of regulators chasing after businesses and insisting on compliance, UK businesses are chasing after regulators and insisting on rules with which they can comply.  There was even one instance where, allegedly, the FCA, on discovering that a bitcoin business had managed to add itself to an FCA register, politely invited that business to de-register itself.  Prevention of money laundering  The prevention of money laundering is taken very seriously in the UK and indeed in many countries around the world.  In the UK, the Money Laundering Regulations 2007 set out who must assist the prevention of money laundering and provide steps on how this should be achieved. Customer due diligence is central to these regulations – businesses should know where money is coming from by identifying their customers.  The Money Laundering Regulations 2007 are enforced by a number of entities, principally the UK’s tax authority, the HMRC (HM Revenue & Customs), and the FCA, but also some others. For example, lawyers are obligated to conduct customer due diligence by the Law Society.  In the UK, however, there is no formal obligation to take any steps to prevent money laundering through dealings made in bitcoin. This is quite remarkable. Compare this to the position in the US, where businesses must comply with anti-money laundering regulations at a federal level and then essentially repeat this compliance in almost every other state.  Once again, UK businesses take regulation into their own hands. UK bitcoin businesses seem, for the most part, to all take some measure or another to try and identify their customers for the purposes of preventing money laundering.  It is fair to say that some businesses go above and beyond what would be required if their business was dealing with pounds sterling rather than bitcoin. The reason for this is simple: UK businesses don’t think that this status quo can be maintained for much longer.  If (or, indeed, when) UK bitcoin businesses are required to comply with anti-money laundering regulation, those businesses could be obligated to undertake customer due diligence on their entire existing customer base. This could be an overwhelming task for a company that has been in business for some years.  Businesses may eventually even be required to report all of their previous dealings as part of a suspicious activity report. It therefore makes much more sense to identify customers from the outset in order to be prepared for these requirements.  Taxation  Four or five months ago, after receiving a number of requests from bitcoin stakeholders about the VAT (value added tax) treatment of bitcoin, HMRC began to issue guidance in the form of a letter.  The guidance stated that bitcoin was to be treated as a single-purpose face-value voucher. This type of voucher is, as the name suggests, redeemable for just a single use. This means that at the time the voucher is bought, it is known whether or not VAT is chargeable on the goods or services for which the voucher can be redeemed. HMRC therefore charges VAT on the purchase of the voucher – they don’t wait around for the redemption.  If you know a little about bitcoin, you will know you can buy more than just one thing with it. It seems to me that someone at HMRC had simply misunderstood bitcoin, but the consequences were serious – anyone selling bitcoin or operating an exchange would have to charge VAT on the value of the bitcoin being sold. This meant that no UK exchange could be both compliant and competitive.  Along with a few others, I was lucky enough to be invited to HMRC to talk about this particular point. Following the meeting, HMRC agreed to withdraw this guidance and re-examine bitcoin to see how VAT should be applied to it.  For once UK businesses were happy to have no regulation. We were told that VAT would most likely be charged on bitcoin service charges, but not bitcoin itself. Therefore an exchange would have to charge VAT on its commission, but not on the bitcoins traded.  HMRC is continuing to consider how best to tax bitcoin and meetings with stakeholders are ongoing. I also understand that HMRC is considering all other aspects of taxation, not just VAT. Hopefully we will see some development in this area soon and a definitive position on how bitcoin businesses should account for tax.  Foreign Regulation  Just because there is so little regulation in the UK, it doesn’t mean that UK businesses aren’t affected by foreign laws. Regulations in the US have a habit of reaching beyond the borders of the 50 states.  In the US, operating a money transmission business is regulated by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) at a federal level, and then again at state level.  In order to be compliant throughout the US, money transmitters must comply with all sorts of customer due diligence obligations and maintain many expensive registrations in each state in which their services are available. Famously, on 18 March 2013, FinCEN extended the scope of this regulation to bitcoin exchanges and others buying and selling bitcoin or other digital currencies.  Unfortunately for UK businesses, this regulation has extraterritorial scope – it even applies to non-US businesses providing their services to US citizens.  Given the burden of complying with US regulation, most UK businesses simply close their doors to US citizens until they are ready to expand into the US market and have sufficient funds to undertake the compliance process. This involves geo-blocking US IP addresses, as well as any blocking any contact made through VPNs or TOR.  Conclusion  The lack of regulation in the UK has caused more problems than opportunities for bitcoin businesses.  Unable to be sure of what regulation is on the horizon and keen to avoid future liability, bitcoin businesses often find themselves taking more regulatory measures than regulated businesses.  On top of this is the biggest problem facing bitcoin in the UK – access to UK banking services. In short, there isn’t any. With the regulatory picture unclear, banks consider it too risky to offer bitcoin businesses a bank account.  In jurisdictions around the world, law makers and regulators are considering if and how to bring digital currencies under their regulatory frameworks.  Meanwhile the entrepreneurs, who can’t help but get started on their new businesses, are left second-guessing what form this new regulation will take and what effect it will have on their own particular business.  Until the inevitable question of regulation is settled, one way or another, digital currency businesses will be unable reach their true potential.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Eitan Jankelewitz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/02/16/bitcoin-regulation-in-the-uk,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/66abdc35c6cd704859c52e7557104c92e7c8d8aa-1000x627.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
