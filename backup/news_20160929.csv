42378840,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mEpp,1475185937,Lightning Test Moves Bitcoin Scaling Into Striking Distance,"A lesser-known startup has successfully tested an important piece of bitcoin's scaling puzzle.  Widely considered to be the best way to boost bitcoin's transaction capacity, the Lightning Network proposes a way to execute the majority of bitcoin transactions without involving the blockchain or compromising the network's decentralized architecture.  But, as a relatively new proposal, it's still very much a work in progress. That's one reason why recent tests completed by a French company called Acinq have generated so much excitement.  Inspired by a white paper released by bitcoin tech firm Bitfury in July, the Acinq team launched 2,500 Amazon Web Service nodes this month as a way to test a proposed routing system for Lightning-style payments earlier this month. Conducted on 18th September, the test put the routing theory proposed in the white paper into practice.  As it showed Lightning nodes could effectively route payments, Bitfury CEO Valery Vavilov argued that the test was a significant milestone for bitcoin.  Vavilov told CoinDesk:  ""This test of Flare, with small modifications made by the Acinq team, shows that our solution for payment routing on the Lightning Network is not only theoretically feasible, but successful.""  For now, this puts to rest skepticism that Lightning routing was too difficult to be implemented at all, as Acinq's routing tests pushed the idea out of theory and into practice.  ""We thought it would interesting to go beyond with a simulation because it showed that actual progress with routing issues and [that] we're getting closer and closer to a working implementation,"" Padiou said.  As the implementation assumes privacy, it also hints that the Lightning Network could succeed in keeping payments private, despite the fact that it effectively adds multiple new parties to bitcoin transactions in an effort to keep them off-chain.  Proposed by developers Joseph Poon and Thaddeus Dryja in February 2015, a number of startups (Lightning, Blockstream, Blockchain) and open-source projects are now working on implementations of the concept.  Paris-based Acinq has so far focused its efforts on its implementation Eclair, driven by what Padiou said were the benefits Lightning could bring to the bitcoin network when it is finally implemented by the open-source community.  Experimenting with tradeoffs  Named after the French word for ""lightning,"" the Eclair implementation offers a test of Bitfury's Flare proposal, which Padiou described as the most advanced routing method developed yet, due in part to how it handles privacy.  Notably, Flare uses a hybrid approach to routing where each node has enough view of the rest of the network to be able to figure out a path to send payments. Put simply, each node only sees a portion of the larger network. Say there's a node sitting in a sea of nodes. It will have connections with all of its neighbors, but also with random nodes sitting further away.  The idea is this gives it the ability to ""see"" what's going on out in front of it, even if it doesn't see everything.  The Acinq team tested this concept using these connections for establishing channels and routing payments on a static route. After setting up the nodes in the cloud, the Acinq team created channels between them and tried to find routes between random nodes, Padiou explained.  In the mailing list dedicated to Lightning Network development, Padiou noted some differences between Eclair's routing approach and what Bitfury proposed in the white paper.  Acinq tried a simplified version that would take less time on average, but that had a smaller success rate of finding a path to the target. ""We wanted to do was answer the question of, 'Can I find a route in less than one second?'"" he explained.  Padiou reported that the test had an 80% success rate of finding a payment path in about half a second.  Next steps  So, when will users be able to use this speedy, scalable service?  The answer might not be so soon, as this is yet another step towards a Lightning Network that can actually carry payments across the network.  ""We think that the dynamic ranking of the routes is the next big challenge,"" said Padiou, explaining that the piece that they just tested is one of two steps for Lightning routing. The first is static routing, the second is dynamic routing.  Having enough of a view of a static network to establish a channel on the network is one thing, but maintaining channels that are changing potentially every second with each new payment is another.  ""This is very difficult to solve because it’s moving all the time,"" Padiou said. ""You can't be sure you'll be able to use a given channel to route a payment because maybe it’s unbalanced. Or maybe a longer route is better because it’s cheaper.""  Yet, it is a small sign that the broader Lightning community also has plans to make all of the implementations compatible with one another, with Lightning Network designer Joseph Poon telling CoinDesk he plans to meet with the Eclair team next week so they can discuss specifications.  Going forward, the community building Lightning also needs work on encrypted communication between nodes, storing channel states, and so on. But Padiou said he plans to stay focused on routing for the time being.

42427100,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJz7rh,1475175624,UBS Unveils Blockchain for Trade Finance at Sibos,"Swiss banking giant UBS has unveiled a project designed to replicate the entire lifecycle of an international trade transaction on Hyperledger's Fabric blockchain.  Built in collaboration with IBM, the trade finance project is still in its earliest stages, but it's arguably already more ambitious than many blockchain prototypes that focus on just a single aspect of the process. Designed to ""holistically"" combine payment transactions, the prototype merges trade finance transactions, foreign exchange payments and more, into one single, elaborate smart contract.  According to UBS's head of product and market development for transaction banking, Beat Bannwart, the effort also involved the full range of UBS professionals who are subject matter experts in these areas.  Bannwart told CoinDesk:  ""We looked at it from a transaction banking point of view, so we involved people from trade, from supply chain finance. But the aim was actually to combine all these different steps into one single solution, where the entire business flow is covered.""  In large transactions, letters of credit can be used by a purchaser's bank to mitigate the sense of risk a seller experiences while the product is in transition. But letters of credit can take as long as seven days to process, according to UBS's numbers, during which time additional risks can accumulate.  To give an idea of how complicated the process is, UBS said a letter of credit can weigh 500 grams and comprise 36 documents.  By programming that process into a smart contract on Hyperledger, Bannwart said he expects to be able to cut the processing time down from seven days to one hour.  In addition to the letter of credit process, the work revealed in a video presentation at Sibos on Wednesday is designed to also incorporate the account opening process and more.  ""It is complementary,"" said Bannwart. ""It is not replacing any procurement or negotiations parties, it is for the pure execution and monitoring afterwards, so that we save them time and you actually have fun to use it.""  Rapid iteration with FinTech startups  The emphasis on fun ran throughout the presentation, which heavily focused on the project's aim to build a user-friendly interface, one that was designed to operate on the go, say for example from a transportation vehicle.  To move that design thinking forward, much of the work was completed during an intensive two-day work session at the financial technology accelerator Level 39 in London, better known for hosting startups than big banks.  During the build, representatives from UBS's IT department joined with staff from the IBM Competency Center to work through the process of moving from visualizations to actually building the product.  IBM's client executive in charge of the UBS integrated account team, Fabio Keller, described the build as a group of ""extraordinary people at the same table, locked down in a room for design thinking.""  Also around that table were Level 39 startups including cloud-hosted blockchain startup Credits and smart documents startup Clause Match, according to the bank’s senior innovation manager, Alex Batlin.  Though he said there are currently no contractual agreements between the startups and UBS, Batlin added that the firms' participation was part of a larger UBS strategy.  He told CoinDesk:  ""We made a very conscious decision, we wanted to make sure that we learn, but also mentor the startups.""  Timeframe unknown  Reports of UBS's blockchain work have been percolating online since last year, including news that multiple blockchain ""experiments"" were underway.  Then, last month the bank emerged as a major player in the space when it was revealed it was part of a five member consortium that was working on a ""utility settlement coin"" designed to help central banks embrace blockchain functionality.  Going forward, it remains unclear how long it will take to complete the international trade project, according to Batlin, who helped build the team behind the effort, but who will be joining BNY Mellon this fall.  But what is more certain, according to Keller is that what happens next.  UBS plans to take the prototype to customers and end users, he said, with the hope that this will ""validate"" that the bank is ""going in the right direction.""

42427091,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJz7Zh,1475173711,Indian Bitcoin Exchange Unocoin Raises $1.5 Million,"Indian bitcoin exchange startup Uncoin has raised $1.5m in new funding.  The pre-Series A round featured a mixture of domestic and international investors, including ah! Ventures, Blume Ventures (which led the round) and Mumbai Angels, as well as BoostVC, BnkToTheFuture, Digital Currency Group and FundersClub.  The funding round, Unocoin's second after a previous seed round, comes less than three years after the Bangalore-based exchange first launched and months after it passed 100,000 customers.  According to Ray, the funds will be used for a variety of purposes, including providing liquidity to its marketplace as well as scaling the exchange's operations both in India and abroad. One possible avenue would be to use some of the funds to market the exchange more effectively within India's major cities.  He told CoinDesk in an interview:  ""One of the things we're looking at is having a stronger presence in the cities, having a physical presence.""  Those backing the project, including Blume Ventures's Karthik Reddy, say they also see the funding round as a vehicle for Unocoin growing its presence in India.  ""We are confident that Unocoin will further alter the landscape and make additional inroads into remittances and e-commerce in India,"" Reddy said in a statement.  Where the long-term trajectory for bitcoin in India lies remains to be seen, though senior regulators in the country have struck negative tones in the past.  In late 2013, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) issued a warning to local consumers about the risks of using digital currencies. At the time, the central bank said that bitcoin (and altcoins like BBQcoin) were not backed by any central authority and that it had not granted approval to companies working in the space.  Two RBI officials stated last summer that, in their view, digital currencies ""have the potential to support criminal, anti-social activities"", calling for a coordinated regulatory response. The Indian central bank later called on the country’s financial sector to explore applications of the technology beyond currencies.

42427090,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJz7dh,1475164999,Why Rabobank's Blockchain Cross-Border Tool Isn't Just a Database,"Dutch multinational bank Rabobank today announced a cross-border payments tool built on Coin Science's multichain distributed ledger.  Developed in partnership with financial technology provider D+H, the new project envisions how distributed ledger tech could enable more than a faster way to move money.  In addition to the cross-border payments functionality, the blockchain tool notifies recipients before taking any actions so they can decide if they want to receive the money and in what form. Then, it lets the bank's independent affiliates work from a shared accounting ledger.  Rabobank's manager of channel support and payment engines, Heimen Schuring, said that by verifying the account information is accurate prior to accepting the funds, his company will be able to save money on what he calls ""repair,"" or trying to figure out what went wrong in a transaction.  Schuring told CoinDesk:  ""When we're sending dollars, we can choose to put it in to his dollar account, or convert it to the euro account. With the pre-notification, we can learn pre-processing if the account is still available.""  Schuring estimates that 60% of repair expenses are now avoidable as a result of the multichain implementation.  Not just a database  Instead of a consortium-based model where multiple banks or other financial entities each manage a node, Rabobank owns and operates every node in the multichain implementation.  While an internally managed blockchain owned by a single entity might start to look an awful lot like a souped-up database, Gene Neyer, head of product management and global payments at D+H, argues it's still fundamentally different.  Specifically, he noted that while a database is general purpose, workflows specific to the way Rabobank operates can be coded into a distributed ledger. Further, he says its ability to be replicated easily acts as a deterrent against fraud.  ""That is a much more powerful thing than a database,"" Neyer told CoinDesk, adding:  ""Databases are still vulnerable to the database administrators, to internal fraud, whereas blockchain, by design is an immutable record.""  Ready for action  Though the service was unveiled as a proof-of-concept, Neyer said the technology is ready to be implemented whenever Rabobank is ready.  ""It's really question of when is the bank comfortable with it and what will they discover as they continue to use this technology,"" he said.  The blockchain set-up is also customizable so it could be used to facilitate communication between banks around the world or even between departments within a single company.  He concluded:  ""It is an example of what I would call an efficiency play within the bank. They are not really transforming a particular slice of the industry, but they are making themselves more efficient, more effective, more responsive.""

42427095,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJz7jh,1475161203,Regulators Block Sale of Bitcoin Miner Avalon,"UPDATE (15th October 21:30 BST): Following publication of this article, Canaan provided CoinDesk with the following statement:  ""The Shenzhen Stock Echange (SZSE) authorities did not block the LYT acquisition deal of Canaan and did not perceive risks or uncertainties around either company or bitcoin as a technology. Canaan and LYT decided to cancel the acquisition deal due to standard regulatory changes in the securities market that made the deal face uncertainty for both parties.""      The deal is said to have been scuttled as a result of apprehension on the part of regulators from the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, which was weighing whether to approve the deal, first revealed in June.  Representatives from Canaan said that following months of auditing, stock exchange officials balked because of the perceived risks and uncertainty surrounding both the company and bitcoin as a technology. Luyitong did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Signs that the acquisition might face problems emerged weeks after it was first announced. At the time, Shenzhen Stock Exchange officials reportedly moved to scrutinize the deal more closely, according to local sources.  Had it been approved, the acquisition would have been the biggest in the bitcoin space to date, involving a publicly traded electronics maker and one of the earliest startups to develop hardware for mining.  Representatives from the firm struck a positive note in statements, saying that Canaan emerged stronger from a months-long auditing process.  CEO NG Zhang said in a statement:  ""While Canaan spent time and resources pulling together this deal, those efforts are not wasted. They are contributions to our future. Internally Canaan strengthened its management structure, refreshed our public image, and have our product pipelines flowing to deliver solid reliable and efficient bitcoin technology solutions worldwide.""  Best known for its Avalon series of bitcoin application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), Canaan was the first to move a bitcoin ASIC to market, an event that changed forever the process by which competing parties race to add block of transactions to the network.  The company said that despite the acquisition deal falling through, plans to release a 16nm bitcoin ASIC are on track.

42427101,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJz7th,1475151053,Inside Bank of America's New Microsoft-Powered Blockchain Project,"Microsoft has been digging deep into the data created by its $120bn treasury unit in search of real-world use cases where blockchain could cut costs.  Culling through this trove of information, Microsoft's newly appointed principal program manager and lead blockchain engineer, Marley Gray, searched for pain points and labor intensive processes that were adding complexity and error to his company's operations.  But the fact that an executive like Gray would be allocating time to such an endeavor is perhaps not surprising. Since helping establish Microsoft Azure's blockchain-as-a-service platform in November 2015, Gray has been working with his company's partners to find new ways to use distributed ledger tech to solve real-world problems.  But, in this case, Gray was also looking for was a problem he could solve quickly.  Gray told CoinDesk:  ""We wanted to pick something that was big enough to matter, but small enough to do quickly. In like, a month.""  The blockchain engineer was speaking from the Sibos financial conference in Geneva, where he had just demoed the prototype that resulted from his searching: a stand-by letter of credit solution built on the ethereum blockchain with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  The prototype  Letters of credit are what banks give clients when they're dealing with new customers who may not know their client well. It's a payment of last resort in which the bank agrees to pay the tab in case the client is unable to do so.  On average, Microsoft says it uses about two letters of credit per week, but that figure increases dramatically on a seasonal basis, according to Gray.  To build the prototype, Gray and his blockchain engineers first worked alongside several Bank of America team members to calculate the number of steps the counterparties in a standby letter of credit transaction need to conduct, from handwritten notes to phone calls and faxes.  In total, the two teams calculated 15 steps that would need to be conducted by four counterparties, including a customer, a beneficiary and each of the counterparty banks.  From beginning to end, the application process takes about five business days, and the team identified an error rate as high as a 50% due to factors like poor data entry and illegible handwriting.  The resulting cost per letter of credit is between $2,500 and $15,000 depending on the number of errors.  Gray summed up the current transaction delays:  ""Those things can't be resolved other than picking up the phone and with the time-zone difference you won’t hear back from them until the next day. When you're dealing with international trade it becomes very painful.""  Banking on blockchain  Microsoft's $120bn treasury is dispersed over 1,000 bank accounts held by multiple providers — one of which is Bank of America Merrill Lynch, and Gray had been consulting with the bank to keep it appraised of his company's blockchain roadmap in the months leading up to the project.  In conversation with CoinDesk, Bank of America's head of North America global trade and supply chain finance, Chris Bozek, said his team had been looking for a way to learn more about how blockchain tech could help his own company and its clients.  To help ensure the proof-of-concept integrated with Bank of America's existing system, Bozek deployed members of Microsoft's core product team, technology team and operations team to validate each of the encoded processes.  ""Each step of the way is important when we are doing a proof-of-concept,"" said Bozek, ""that we can see the connection points to the broader enterprise.""  Built on a multi-node, private installation of the ethereum blockchain, the prototype simplifies the standby letter for credit process from 15 to four steps. And with a 0% error rate, it cuts the time down from five days to between five and 10 minutes, according to Gray’s numbers.  The benefits of such a streamlining include not only helping Microsoft and Bank of America save time by reducing errors, but increasing transparency, resulting in a more efficient means to manage cash flow and working capital, according to Bozek.  While the prototype demoed to CoinDesk earlier this week shows that ""the plumbing works,"" as Bozek put it, he added that it only ""scratches to surface"" of how it can be used.  He concluded:  ""Now that we have that down, we move to some of the more complex products.""  Beyond plumbing  The next step is to build a pilot that runs parallel to the existing analog application, with other counterparties and new partners participating.  Currently, the business model has yet to be determined.  But Marley told CoinDesk Microsoft is unlikely to seek to take ownership of the tech. ""We’ll probably turn it over to an existing consortia and say 'Here you go,'"" he said.  As time goes on, Gray expects to add new features from Microsoft's Project Bletchley, including identity management, integration with the Azure Active Directory, a blockchain identity service, key management and data services such as data analytics dashboards.  Among other applications that the standby letter of credit ""plumbing"" might be able to serve are commercial letters of credit, and other even more complicated trade financing products that involve numerous counterparties.  ""But the value or promise of blockchains is that the value of the network itself goes up by each counterparty you add,"" said Gray.  During side-by-side tests, his team added additional counterparties to the credit application process to see what happened to the system's efficiency.  While the number of steps in the analog process increased to more than 15, ""the blockchain line stayed flat,"" he said.  Gray concluded:  ""That kind of proved our point, the near exponential value of the network relative to the number of counterparties. It was a good experiment for us to figure out, is the promise real?""

42427082,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJz7Jh,1475144705,UK Dependency Adjusts Laws for Digital Currency,"The government of Jersey is pushing ahead with its previously announced plans to regulate digital currency exchange activity.  Authorities in the British Crown dependency announced a plan to introduce legislation just under a year ago. At the time, government representatives expressed a desire to avoid a full-on licensure scheme similar to the BitLicense pursued by New York, but with a registration system for certain service providers.  According to a government order published on 23rd September by the State Assembly, Jersey's legislature, anyone operating as a digital currency exchanger is exempt from registration requirements if their annual turnover is less than £150,000. The order came into force on 26th September.  In the event that the service provider goes over that annual amount, they have up to three months to notify the Jersey government or face potential sanction, according to the documents.  The order states:  ""Article 4 makes transitional provision for the case where turnover first exceeds £150,000, so that a person carrying on such a business will not be criminally liable if, within a period of three months beginning with the day on which the turnover reaches or exceeds that figure, the person makes an application for registration under the 2008 law.""  Separately, documents show, the Jersey legislature has also approved a change to the dependency's money laundering statutes that captures digital currency exchangers.  According to the order, ""the business of providing the service of virtual currency exchange is introduced into the categories of financial services business regulated by the [Money Laundering Order]"".  The orders reflects the outcome of a consultation process begun last year by Jersey's government.  At the time, Senator Philip Ozouf, the island's assistant chief minister, said that ""virtual currency systems represent a new and empowering technology"" and that the government was hoping to craft ""appropriate"" policies around it.
