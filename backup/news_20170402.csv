42379365,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87bwT,1491143414,All Business? Bitcoin is Becoming a Hobby for Exchange Employees,"After years of grabbing global headlines, it seems bitcoin is making inroads with employees at exchanges and solutions providers in the sector.  At the World Exchange Congress this week, bitcoin wasn't a frequent topic of discussion, appearing only in conversations spurred by evangelists. Still, while many companies are still trying to make sense of applications for distributed ledger tech (DLT), their employees appear to be embracing the general idea as hobbyists, using cryptocurrencies as a way to learn – and earn – on the side.  For example, Lazlo Szabo, a member of the IT department at the publicly owned Budapest Stock Exchange, wasn't able to provide much insight into what his firm is doing to get up to speed on developments in the blockchain sector.  ""For the company, it's a lot – we have another problems to solve before we take a huge step,"" Szabo said, noting the exchange is already upgrading its trading engine.  Still, that isn’t stopping Szabo from checking websites CoinMarketCap, a cryptocurrency price and information page, daily with about five of his other co-workers.  He told CoinDesk:  ""We are trading bitcoin or other altcoins, about five people altogether. It's not so much. It's a hobby, you check the news and technologies.""  Szabo went on to suggest he believes the technology will ""become more common"", though he's not sure when or how it will end up being applied. The case is much the same for Elie Cezard, fixed income business director at exchange tech provider Trading Screen.  Cezard reported being active in his local blockchain communities, and said Trading Screen had even been in discussions to add bitcoin as an FX option, though the plan never quite came to fruition.  Like other peers at the event, Cezard sees more potential for the tech in back-end settlement and post-trade clearing sectors.  ""Our clients are institutional investors and, for the moment, there's no way we can really get institutional investors to go into cryptocurrencies,"" he said. Still, he acknowledged that other companies are moving in that direction.  Coming soon  Also notable were the number of respondents who spoke generally about digital currencies and blockchain, with some being quick to see applications for the tech, and others seeming unsure of just what to make of it.  Paul Bwiso, CEO for the Uganda Securities Exchange, the nation's principal stock exchange, sees the appeal in bitcoin as a kind of virtual money. Given the importance of the mobile phone in Africa’s financial system, he sees the link, even if he doesn’t believe it’s an opportunity for his operation.  Still, he said he was positive generally about the tech, remarking: ""I think it's the future.""  A similar outlook was put forward by Khalifa Bin Ebrahim, CEO of Bahrain Bourse, who argued that he believes blockchain will first find its way into finance, if first in back-office, post-trade systems.  ""It will be a good value proposition to build a strong case,"" he said.  Thoughts but little action  Among the crowd was also a handful of skeptics – not of bitcoin, but of the idea that its underlying blockchain technologies could be more broadly applied.  One such voice was Riskbone founder Lanre Sarumi, who said he believes bitcoin has a ""clear direction"" and that the blockchain is an obvious use case for a global currency.  Still, Sarumi hasn’t found a way to work cryptocurrencies into his offering. That doesn’t mean he’s not looking, though, and he expressed interest in trading bitcoin futures – in part because of the issues surrounding storing and holding cryptographic keys that manage access to blockchain-linked data.  He also spoke to broad concerns amongst traders about the relatively new asset, showcasing just how far bitcoin has to go, even with those who understand it well.  ""You don't want to be the one holding on to bitcoin when it completely collapses,"" he said.  Kraken business development lead Reed Holmes reported that more hobbyists are beginning to turn to the cryptocurrency market on the side, drawn like Sarumi to its perceived future impact.  ""A lot of these guys are pure traders, they’re hobbyists, they seem to be really interested in it,"" he said, though he acknowledged action by their companies is so far more scarce.  Holmes concluded:  ""I think maybe it’s a mindset and somewhere down the line they have to realize that bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are coming.""

42379375,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87c93,1491141139,How Cornell Researchers Are Quietly Reinventing Private Blockchains,"Researchers might seem like an unlikely group to probe the private blockchain sphere, where the major players are a mix of banks and tech behemoths. But at least a few Cornell University researchers from the Institute for CryptoCurrencies & Contracts have turned some of their attention toward permissioned implementations in an effort to improve them.  Rather than an open system like bitcoin that anyone can join, private blockchains rely on a set number of known participants to verify transactions and bundle them into so-called 'blocks'.  Current implementations, though, leave something to be desired, the researchers argue.  Simplicity is an important, if dull sounding, piece that Cornell University principal research scientist Robbert van Renesse stressed many private blockchain implementations are missing.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Being able to scrutinize technology is the cornerstone of scientific discovery, I think. That peers can understand what’s going on is important. It doesn’t have to be everybody, but if it’s just a handful of people there might be some reason for concern.""  That may well be the case for current private blockchain implementations, according to Renesse, as the distributed algorithms that private blockchains rely on are rather complex.  At least, that's the claim.  Scrutable blockchains  Private blockchains generally depend on technologies that predate bitcoin, such as practical byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT), to come to agreement about the history of transactions. There are many different ways for private blockchains to reach agreement and, if research from Cornell is of any indication, certain ways of doing so have been under-explored.  Renesse argued that the Linux Foundation-backed Hyperledger's flagship implementation, Fabric, one of the best-known permissioned blockchain protocols, is an example of one that's too complex.  ""The code for the protocol consists of tens of thousands of lines of code. Analysis of the correctness properties is 40 or 60 pages,"" Renesse said.  The result? Only a few people understand how it works.  Renesse has been researching so-called Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) for decades. Although it sounds befuddling to those not immersed in the science, nodes in a network are notoriously bad at working together. They're clumsy; some fail, while others stop spontaneously.  Put simply, there are a range of problems, and the study of BFT, in particular, deals with some of the more irregular ones.  Now, Renesse is building on a protocol, Bosco, that he developed in 2008.  Originally, he said, he didn't think of it as anything more than a ""toy protocol"", but, now that private blockchains are gaining ground – and the entire field of distributed systems is taking off as a result – Renesse is researching how it could be used in a permissioned setting.  ""I had a look at Bosco and asked, 'How impractical is this exactly?',"" he said.  In contrast to something like Fabric, he argued, the algorithm is much simpler – it takes two pages to outline its security guarantees and it can be implemented in 1,000 lines of code.  ""This is a protocol that I can explain to high schoolers,"" he said. ""I'm pretty confident that after staring at it for a few days they can understand it inside and out.""  Seeking simplicity  IC3 co-director Elaine Shi is working on a similar project.  ""I’m a big believer in simplicity,"" she said, making the same point as Renesse, unprompted and during a separate conversation. She's working on another project, dubbed 'Sleepy', which, like other permissioned implementations, ditches bitcoin's proof-of-work system, which is used to establish the validity of transaction blocks.  It is ""extremely simple,"" she said, adding that it has ""strong robustness properties,"" meaning that the nodes don't fail so easily. Further, it doesn't require global coordination, where every node needs to agree on an action.  ""For a consortium, you want to use something that is more manageable,"" she said, pointing out that other private blockchains, such as Chain Core, don't have this property.  It's a process that they're rolling out step by step. Shi mentioned that she and PhD student Phil Daian have been working with Parity, an ethereum client written in Rust. Parity can support a variety of modes of consensus (including their own private protocol as proof of authority (PoA)). So, the Cornell team is testing how Sleepy works in this setting.  Shi used PoA as a guinea pig for comparisons to Sleepy, arguing that Sleepy has better security guarantees, which were spelled out in a white paper released last fall.  ""Proof of authority doesn’t make sense when there’s something clearly better,"" she said.  Step by step  However, where might these tools might be rolled out? It's a question that's been long asked of enterprise blockchains in general.  For Sleepy, Shi and the Cornell team are starting with collaboration with Parity, but the aim is to eventually incorporate it into other frameworks as well.  Renesse's implementation might not be far enough along for that yet.  ""I implemented [Bosco] on a plane ride from Beijing to Newark,"" he said, adding that the next step is to do a more ""proper"" evaluation.  There could be a couple drawbacks to the system, however.  Bosco perhaps could run into more node crashes, where nodes stop responding to requests and fail to participate. PBFT guarantees data consistency as long as less than one third of nodes are faulty, while Bosco has a lower threshold of one fifth of the nodes.  Renesse cited another problem that affects all private blockchain systems: that a ""malicious bank"" could bring the entire system to a halt by flooding it with spam.  He doesn't consider this a potentially major a problem, though, because participants can simply agree to throw out the bad actor. Despite the drawbacks, Renesse thinks Bosco could give banks and institutions another option.  He concluded:  ""Banks are most likely to run a protocol and accept the occasional mistake or occasional disgruntled employee that tries to do something bad.""
