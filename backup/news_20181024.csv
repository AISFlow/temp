42381351,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94t9d,1540418414,Planting Bitcoin Part One: Species,"Dan Held is the founder of crypto portfolio service Picks & Shovels. He previously founded data service ZeroBlock, which sold to Blockchain, and served as VP of product at ChangeTip.  This exclusive opinion piece is part of CoinDesk's ""Bitcoin at 10: The Satoshi White Paper"" series.      Bitcoin's origin is akin to planting a tree.  It wasn't just Satoshi's selection of the species (code), but the season (timing), soil (distribution) and gardening (community) that were essential to its success. It had to grow to be strong, mighty and huge. It had to survive droughts, storms and predators. Its deep roots had to support the weight of becoming a new world reserve currency.  To enjoy this article in its fullest, I recommend playing this song then continue reading. If you like this music, please follow my playlist on Spotify.  What is Money?  Money is most easily defined as the medium in which value is transferred.  But money is not just paper in your hand, or numbers in your bank account, money represents something much more fundamental:  Money is a primitive form of memory or record-keeping. It is the collective memory of who has the ability to allocate wealth.  Money, which is the representation of the work required to acquire goods and services, can also be viewed as stored energy.  Money is the central information utility of the world economy. As a medium of exchange, store of value, and unit of account, money is the critical vessel of information about the conditions of markets.  The main functions of money are Store of Value (SoV), Medium of Exchange (MoE), and Unit of Account (UoA). No money starts by providing all three functions, each new species of money follows a distinct evolutionary path that we will cover later. Let's first start by identifying the newest species of money, bitcoin.  Species  ""These protocols can't be described comprehensively as static objective things. They're best thought of as live systems."" — Ari Paul  Bitcoin is a new form of life, a new species of money called ""cryptocurrency."" More importantly, it is ""sound money,"" or using proper taxonomy, ""sanum pecuniam."" Sound money is defined as money that has a purchasing power determined by markets, independent of governments and political parties which is essential for individual freedom.  ""I had to write all the code before I could convince myself that I could solve every problem, then I wrote the paper."" — Satoshi Nakamoto  The code of life is written into an organism at its inception. Satoshi carefully architected Bitcoin's DNA, or genetic code, to be the best sound money ever created.  We can think of bitcoin's genetic code as representing instructions that have been written to incentivize the organization and coordination of cellular function.  ""I believe I've worked through all those little details over the last year and a half while coding it, and there were a lot of them."" – Satoshi Nakamoto  Bitcoin's genetic code:  Satoshi needed a way for the bitcoin to spark itself into existence, so he coded in its DNA a fixed supply (21 million bitcoins). An increase in bitcoin's price inevitably leads to a corresponding increase in participants (users), security (mining), and developers. This becomes a self-reinforcing feedback loop.  Bitcoin's mining function, proof-of-work (PoW) is both its metabolism and defense mechanism. Bitcoin eats energy to generate new coins and build digital walls to protect the network. PoW also makes bitcoin anti-fragile, or in other words, as it grows larger, it becomes more resistant to attack.  A new bitcoin block is found every 10 minutes, this genetic code enables Bitcoin's cells to effectively communicate and coordinate with each other despite enormous distances. It is the internal clock that sets the metabolic rate.  ""It lives and breathes on the internet. It lives because it can pay people to keep it alive. It lives because it performs a useful service that people will pay it to perform. It lives because anyone, anywhere, can run a copy of its code. It lives because all the running copies are constantly talking to each other. It lives because it is radically transparent: anyone can see its code and see exactly what it does. It can't be changed. It can't be argued with. It can't be tampered with. It can't be corrupted. It can't be stopped. It can't even be interrupted. If nuclear war destroyed half of our planet, it would continue to live, uncorrupted."" — Ralph Merkle  Bitcoin's genetic code manifests itself via traits (characteristics of an organism) that may or may not be visible.  Traits  In biology, a trait or character is a feature of an organism.  According to Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection, organisms that possess heritable traits that enable them to better adapt to their environment compared with other members of their species will be more likely to survive, reproduce, and pass more of their genes on to the next generation.  Money is no different. Money has traits that enable it to survive and thrive as a Store of Value (SoV), Medium of Exchange (MoE), and Unit of Account (UoA). Bitcoin is a new species that has vastly superior traits to its predecessors. Below we dive deeper into those traits between different species of money.  (The sections below, on the attributes that make for a good money, are largely borrowed from Vijay Boyapati's article ""The Bullish Case for Bitcoin"")  Verifiable  Fiat currencies and gold are fairly easy to verify for authenticity.  However, despite providing features on their banknotes to prevent counterfeiting, nation-states and their citizens still face the potential to be duped by counterfeit bills. Gold is also not immune from being counterfeited.  Sophisticated criminals have used gold-plated tungsten as a way of fooling gold investors into paying for false gold. Bitcoins, on the other hand, can be verified with absolute mathematical certainty.  Fungible  Gold provides the standard for fungibility.  When melted down, an ounce of gold is nearly indistinguishable from any other ounce. Fiat currencies, on the other hand, are only as fungible as the issuing institutions allow them to be. While it may be the case that a fiat banknote is usually treated like any other by merchants accepting them, there are instances where large-denomination notes have been treated differently to small ones.  For instance, India's government, in an attempt to stamp out India's untaxed gray market, completely demonetized their 500 and 1000 rupee banknotes. Bitcoins are fungible at the network level, meaning that every bitcoin, when transmitted, is treated the same on the Bitcoin network.  However, because bitcoins are traceable on the blockchain, a particular bitcoin may become tainted by its use in illicit trade and merchants or exchanges may be compelled not to accept such tainted bitcoins.  Despite this, there is no alternative pricing for ""tainted Bitcoins"" so it remains highly fungible.  Portable  Bitcoins are the most portable store of value ever used by man.  A single USB stick can contain a billion dollars, easily carried anywhere, transmitted near instantly. Fiat currencies, being fundamentally digital, are also highly portable.  However, governments can control the free flow of capital. Cash can be used to avoid capital controls, but then the risk of storage and cost of transportation become significant. Gold, being physical in form and incredibly dense, is by far the least portable.  When bullion is transferred between a buyer and a seller it is typically only the title to the gold that is transferred, not the physical bullion itself (It cost Germany $9.1 million to repatriate their gold).  Durable  Gold is the king of durability — the vast majority of gold that has ever been mined or minted, including the gold of the Pharaohs, remains today and will for near eternity (it can only be destroyed through nuclear transmutation).  While fiat currency exists both in physical and digital forms, we will only consider the durability of its digital form… the durability of the institution that issues them. Many fiat issuing governments have come and gone over the centuries, and their currencies disappeared with them.  If history is a guide, it would be folly to consider fiat currencies durable in the long term — the US dollar and British Pound are relative anomalies in this regard. Bitcoins, having no issuing authority, may be considered durable so long as the network that secures them remains in place. Given that Bitcoin is still in its infancy, it is too early to draw strong conclusions about its durability.  However, there are encouraging signs that the network displays a remarkable degree of ""anti-fragility.""  Divisible  Bitcoins can be divided down to a hundred millionth of a bitcoin and transmitted at such infinitesimal amounts. Fiat currencies are typically divisible down to pocket change, which has little purchasing power, making fiat divisible enough in practice.  Gold, while physically divisible, becomes difficult to use when divided into small enough quantities that it could be useful for lower-value day-to-day trade.  Scarce  The attribute that most clearly distinguishes Bitcoin from fiat currencies and gold is its predetermined absolute scarcity: only 21 million bitcoins can ever be created (the number of units is arbitrary, as bitcoins can be subdivided into 210 quadrillion satoshis).  This gives the owner of bitcoins a known percentage of the total possible supply. Gold, while remaining quite scarce through history, is not immune to increases in supply. If it were ever the case that a new method of mining or acquiring gold became economic, the supply of gold could rise dramatically (ex: sea-floor or asteroid mining).  Finally, fiat currencies, while only a relatively recent invention of history, have proven to be prone to constant increases in supply. Nation-states have shown a persistent proclivity to inflate their money supply to solve short-term political problems.  Established history  No monetary good has a history as long and storied as gold, which has been valued for as long as human civilization has existed. Coins minted in the distant days of antiquity still maintain significant value today.  The same cannot be said of fiat currencies, which are a relatively recent anomaly of history. From their inception, fiat currencies have had a near-universal tendency toward eventual worthlessness. The use of inflation as an insidious means of invisibly taxing a citizenry has been a temptation that no states in history have been able to resist.  Bitcoin, despite its short existence, has weathered enough trials in the market that there is a high likelihood it will not vanish as a valued asset any time soon. Furthermore, the Lindy effect suggests that the longer Bitcoin remains in existence the greater society's confidence that it will continue to exist long into the future. The median age of a human is ~30 years old, which means Bitcoin has been around for nearly 33.3% of the average human life.  If bitcoin exists for 20 years, there will be near-universal confidence that it will be available forever, much as people believe the Internet is a permanent feature of the modern world.  Censorship resistant  One of the most significant sources of early demand for bitcoins was their use in the illicit drug trade. Silk Road was a testament to this resistance.  The key attribute that makes bitcoin valuable for proscribed activities is that it is ""permissionless"" at the network level. When bitcoins are transmitted on the bitcoin network, there is no human intervention deciding whether the transaction should be allowed.  As a distributed peer-to-peer network, bitcoin is, by its very nature, designed to be censorship-resistant. This is in stark contrast to the fiat banking system, where states regulate banks and the other gatekeepers of money transmission to report and prevent outlawed uses of monetary goods. A classic example of regulated money transmission is capital controls.  A wealthy millionaire, for instance, may find it very hard to transfer their wealth to a new domicile if they wish to flee an oppressive regime (Russian assets in the UK being frozen). Although gold is not issued by states, its physical nature makes it difficult to transmit at distance, making it far more susceptible to state regulation than bitcoin.  India's Gold Control Act is an example of such regulation. If your mission is to disrupt central banks, you need to have sovereign level censorship resistance.  ""Bitcoin's advantages lie not in its speed, convenience, or friendly user experience. Bitcoin's value comes from it having an immutable monetary policy precisely because nobody can easily change it."" — Saifedean Ammous  Unforgeable Costliness  Money that is costly to create, due either to its original cost (gold mining) or the improbability of its history (art) — and that it is difficult to fake this costliness. Bitcoin's PoW ensures the cost to mine a Bitcoin is near equivalent to how much it would cost to purchase one on an exchange. The unforgeable costliness pattern includes the following basic steps:    ""(1) find or create a class of objects that is highly improbable, takes much effort to make, or both, and such that the measure of their costliness can be verified by other parties.      (2) use the objects to enable a protocol or institution to cross trust boundaries"" – Nick Szabo    Openly Programmable  Bitcoin is open-source; its design is public, it is usable by anyone/anywhere/anytime. Developers can freely program applications on top of the Bitcoin protocol without having to ask anyone for permission.  ""It is dynamic, upgradable and extendable. It does not need throwing out and replacing with each new iteration, it will continuously improve."" — Neil Woodfine  Decentralized  In it's simplest definition, decentralization means a lack of centralized control. Or the degree to which an entity within the system can resist coercion and still function as part of the system. Coercion doesn't necessarily mean force, it means negative incentives to align with an authority.  Decentralization is an important trait for money because any centralized control could threaten any one of the other traits (especially scarcity and censorship resistance)  Decentralization is also important because it enables greater social scalability. The challenge is that natural systems inherently evolve towards centralization (hierarchies). We see this emergent property in cryptocurrencies as well. Hierarchy is an emergent property of networks. When we consider more complex systems, we must contend with more complex relationships between the layers. Quantifying decentralization is an especially thorny issue.  ""Decentralization is such a misunderstood concept, because people apply it to a whole system, when really it needs to be applied to multiple layers within the system: The Protocol, The Politics and The Practical."" — Sarah Lewis  Evolution  For a species of money to survive, it needs to be competitive on every attribute and be exceptionally better on a few of them. Attributes don't sum, they multiply.  When Gold was first introduced, the bead makers (an example of a more primitive form of money) probably tried to convince the ignorant population that gold was no substitute for beads. But it turned out that gold had traits that were more advantageous. It did not matter what anyone thought. Gold was destined to be a more powerful currency than shells or beads.  The fact that gold has remained a valued commodity for thousands of years speaks to the importance of these specific traits. In fact, the combination of traits possessed by gold and other precious metals eventually provided the foundation for the next evolution in money, fiat currency.  In money's next evolution of species, fiat currency fulfilled several critical traits to an even greater degree than gold. Paper was more portable and could be more easily transacted.  That is not to say it was entirely superior. In many cases, fiat currencies lacked durability, and as we will see, would eventually become less and less scarce (due to inflation). The critical flaw: its supply was controlled by kings and governments and increasingly used as a tool to wield power and control. Upon every new iteration of species, they each evolve in the following four stages (taken from ""The Bullish Case for Bitcoin""):  Collectible: In the very first stage of its evolution, money will be demanded solely based on its peculiar properties, usually becoming a whimsy of its possessor. Shells, beads and gold were all collectibles before later transitioning to the more familiar roles of money.  Store of value: Once it is demanded by enough people for its peculiarities, money will be recognized as a means of keeping and storing value over time. As a good becomes more widely recognized as a suitable store of value, its purchasing power will rise as more people demand it for this purpose. The purchasing power of a store of value will eventually plateau when it is widely held and the influx of new people desiring it as a store of value dwindles.  Medium of exchange: When money is fully established as a store of value, its purchasing power will stabilize. Having stabilized in purchasing power, the opportunity cost of using money to complete trades will diminish to a level where it is suitable for use as a medium of exchange.  Unit of account: When money is widely used as a medium of exchange, goods will be priced in terms of it. I.e., the exchange ratio against money will be available for most goods.    Bitcoin's stage in the evolutionary process is shown below, provided by Murad Mahmudov.  Extinction can most simply be described as the failure of a species to compete in an environment to such at a degree that it eventually ceases to exist. The inability to compete itself may be the result of two primary causes; increased competition from superior species or a dramatic change in environment.  ""Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection originated to provide an evidence-based explanation of the past. We now leverage this theory to look forward and understand its implications on the future of currency. Given the ever-changing conditions of the future, will gold and fiat currencies continue to compete or go the way of the dinosaur?"" — Ryan Walker ""On the Origins of Money: Darwin and the Evolution of Cryptocurrency""  According to a study of 775 fiat currencies by DollarDaze.org the average life expectancy of a fiat currency is 27 years. The study also indicated the most common causes of any given currencies extinction are hyperinflation, monetary reform, war and independence.  Looking towards the fittest of fiat currencies, those that become reserve currencies, we find that most last just under 100 years. (Note: US currency only starts from 1933 because USD was redeemable for gold prior to that)  With fiat currencies being so susceptible to failure, gold has long served as an alternative as it is more scarce and durable. In terms of scarcity, fiat currencies can be printed and inflated at the will of their authorities.  ""While Bitcoin is a new invention of the digital age, the problems it purports to solve — namely, providing a form of money that is under the full command of its owner and likely to hold its value in the long run — are as old as human society itself."" — Saifedean Ammous  The currencies are in a state of hyper-evolution as they continue to take on a varied array of distinctive traits that set them apart from one another within their own competitive ecosystem (fiat/crypto).  Equally as threatening to traditional forms of money, the conditions of the environment in which currencies compete is in a constant state of change. Undertones of growing distrust in centralized entities encourage populations to consider alternative stores of value.  Sovereignty, once a trait that was necessary for the survival of a currency, may now be falling out of favor. Centralized failures such as the US financial crisis of 2008 or hyper-inflated fiat currencies such as Zimbabwe dollars or Argentinian pesos compound these sentiments. The most profound of these conditions is the growing awareness throughout the world that decentralized trust is possible.  Instead of becoming anti-fragile, which is the property of growing stronger in a volatile and stressful environment, central banks have removed danger and mortality from failure, which causes competition to stagnate or degrade.  Sometimes stresses are so strong that they are fatal for a species of money. While this is devastating for the money itself, the population comprised of those that survive are fitter on average. This isn't because any of the survivors grew stronger from the stress, but simply because the weaker monies were removed.  ""We humans regularly underestimate high-impact, long-tail events. Careful consideration of long tail events is especially important in the design of a protocol that has the potential to become the backbone of the global economy"" — Hugo Nguyen  It is interesting to imagine what Charles Darwin would make of the current state of money. History would have us believe that the existence and survival of any entity, be it plant, animal, corporation, or money is the subject to the laws of natural selection.  With this understanding, it is hard to imagine Darwin contesting the opinion that Bitcoin possesses the necessary traits to become the dominant species of money.  Bitcoin is perfectly honed for its environment through its exceptional genetic code and the manifestation of that code in the form of superior traits.  Bitcoin is the apex predator of money, and is constantly evolving. None of the previous monetary life forms stand a chance.

42381347,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94t4b,1540415131,AMD: GPU Sales to Crypto Miners Was 'Negligible' in Q3,"AMD's sales of graphics cards to cryptocurrency miners have all but dried up.  The chip manufacturer generated ""negligible"" revenue from blockchain-related GPU sales in the third quarter, accounting for only a ""high single digit percentage"" of the company's top line, AMD said Wednesday. This followed a drop in this type of revenue in the previous quarter.  Overall, AMD'S computing and graphics revenue slid 14 percent from the second quarter, though revenue from this business line was up 12 percent compared to a year earlier.  In its last quarterly report in July, AMD stated that about 6 percent of its second-quarter revenue came from selling to crypto miners – down from 10 percent in the first quarter.  At the time, AMD said that it expected GPU sales to miners to continue to decline, a prediction that was borne out by Wednesday's report.  On a July 25 conference call, CEO Lisa Su said the company was ""expecting very little from blockchain,"" and it had lowered its forecast for revenue from the industry.  The company has been tempering market expectations for revenue from GPUs since at least March, however.

42381328,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94slj,1540406743,Tether Just Burned 500 Million USDT Stablecoin Tokens,"UPDATE (24 October 19:25 UTC): This article has been updated to include comments from a Bitfinex spokesman.      Shortly before 1:00 p.m. ET Wednesday, Tether, the company behind the dollar-linked stablecoin of the same name, announced via Twitter that it had destroyed 500 million tether (USDT) tokens.  Previously, those tokens were held in an account known as the ""Tether treasury."" The past few weeks have seen massive influxes of USDT to the Treasury, particularly after the cryptocurrency lost parity with the U.S. dollar last week amid questions about Tether's access to banking services.  From Oct. 14, when USDT started to slip below $1.00, to Oct. 23, 680 million USDT were transferred to the company-controlled Treasury wallet. All of these transfers came from an address controlled by Bitfinex, a cryptocurrency exchange that overlaps with Tether in terms of ownership and management.  Bitfinex's cold wallet's balance has fallen by around 100,000 bitcoin since early September, leading some to speculate that the exchange has been spending bitcoin in order to take tether off the market – perhaps to push the exchange rate back towards the $1.00 mark, or perhaps even to exit the stablecoin business entirely.  As a result of these transfers, the supply of tethers in circulation has dropped by around a quarter in a week and a half, to approximately $2 billion. Now many of these tokens, in addition to having been taken out of circulation, have been ""burned"" or destroyed by the company.  Kasper Rasmussen, Bitfinex's director of communications, said the action ""does not have anything to do with defending dollar parity,"" since both the exchange and Tether guarantee 1-for-1 redemptions. He denied that Tether is intentionally scaling back supply.  Tether tokens are redeemed ""when the amount circulating exceeds the amount required for e.g. Bitfinex or Tether to operate,"" Rasmussen said, and the reason most of the destroyed tokens came from Bitfinex's wallet is that ""Bitfinex is one of the main customers of Tether.""  In its announcement Wednesday, Tether said that it had not burned all of the USDT in the Treasury account, and that around 466 million USDT remain in the account ""as a preparatory measure for future USDT issuances.""  True redemption?  The announcement characterized transfers of USDT to the Treasury as ""redemption,"" a process that Tether described in its original white paper.  The 2016 white paper specifies that USDT holders can redeem their tokens for U.S. dollars directly with the company. Tether maintains that every USDT token is backed by a U.S. dollar deposit, but has not convinced many skeptics that the cryptocurrency is in fact fully collateralized.  The anonymous anti-Tether campaigner ""Bitfinex'ed,"" however, disputed Tether's characterization of transfers to the Treasury as a ""redemption,"" writing: ""Not one person can come forward and say that they converted Tethers to dollars and got wired money from Tether.""  Rasmussen, the Bitfinex spokesman, claimed otherwise, telling CoinDesk: ""Yes, direct customers of Tether are able to redeem USDT through Tether Ltd.""  But many others allege that it is not possible to redeem USDT tokens for dollars with Tether.

42381349,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94t77,1540400453,CoinMarketCap Excludes Some Tether Data After Clarification by Bitfinex,"CoinMarketCap, the most-visited aggregator of cryptocurrency market data, has changed the way it uses data from the Bitfinex exchange in response to a report by CoinDesk.  On Tuesday, CoinDesk pointed out that a trading pair shown on CoinMarketCap – seemingly, for trades between the tether stablecoin (USDT) and U.S. dollars – did not, in fact, represent a pair that's available for trading on Bitfinex. From looking at CoinMarketCap data, the ostensible pair appeared to be the second-highest by 24-hour volume on the exchange at the time the article was written.  In response to CoinDesk's report, Bitfinex clarified that the volume shown on CoinMarketCap represented the sum of withdrawals and deposits of USDT to and from Bitfinex.  After receiving that clarification, Carylyne Chan, CoinMarketCap's global head of marketing, told CoinDesk:  ""The team has revised to exclude its volume. This will represent it accordingly and ensure it does not have any contributions to volume going forward. You can see this on the page with ** pointing to volume exclusion.""  She included the following screenshot:  However, while the Bitfinex USDT/USD pair's volume appears to be excluded from calculations on CoinMarketCap's tether markets page, it is unclear whether it's been excluded from volume totals on the site's Bitfinex page.  For one thing, the pair is not labeled with a double asterisk, denoting ""volume excluded,"" on the Bitfinex exchange page. Further, the sum of all listed Bifinex pairs' 24-hour volumes yielded the total volume listed at the top of the page, suggesting that the $39.5 million in USDT/USD volume had not been excluded. Chan did not immediately respond to a follow-up question on this.  Kasper Rasmussen, Bitfinex's head of marketing, said of the change at CoinMarketCap, ""It means nothing to us as the API tracks something which is used internally only. It is not a USD/USDT trading pair.""  Push and pull  While Bitfinex has suggested that CoinMarketCap is responsible for how it presents data from the exchange's application programming interface (API), CoinMarketCap described a lack of communication on Bitfinex's part.  As noted in Tuesday's article, Chan of CoinMarketCap told CoinDesk that Bitfinex had ""not responded to multiple direct requests from our team members"" regarding the data point, which she said was drawn from Bitfinex's API.  Prior to the article's publication, Rasmussen had confirmed to CoinDesk that the USDT/USD pair was not available for trading on Bitfinex and said he would follow up ""asap"" regarding the data displayed on CoinMarketCap.  CoinDesk's subsequent emails – which included statements from CoinMarketCap – did not receive a reply, however, until after the story was posted.  Following the article's publication, Bitfinex objected to the headline's description of the exchange as ""publishing data for a tether market that doesn't exist,"" on the grounds that CoinMarketCap is responsible for how it uses the API data. Bitfinex wrote on Twitter:    ""We are not 'publishing' fake numbers; the API method is called 'movement_volume' and isn't part of our ticker API. Not pushed by us, pulled by CMC. Another not-so-brilliant example of anti Bitfinex/Tether FUD.""            Bitfinex has close ties to Tether, the company that issues USDT, with the two firms sharing common managers and shareholders. The stablecoin lost its market parity with the U.S. dollar last week amid renewed speculation that tether tokens are not fully collateralized by dollar bank deposits.  At midday Wednesday, USDT was still below $1, trading at $0.98, according to CoinMarketCap.

42381339,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94sx3,1540396869,This College Freshman Is Out to 51% Attack Your Cryptocurrency,"A college freshman is coming after your cryptocurrency – but not to steal your coins, just to prove that someone could do so pretty easily.  According to a crypto enthusiast and security researcher going by the handle ""geocold51,"" most small-scale cryptocurrencies are at risk from the industry's most feared vulnerability – the 51% attack. During this attack, a miner takes over more than half of a cryptocurrency's mining power, which then allows them to erase a past transaction and replace it with another transaction – called a double spend.  While the ecosystem that's been built up around bitcoin and other top-tier cryptos make them resistant to these kinds of attacks, other cryptocurrencies with less of a community of miners aren't as secure.  Sure enough, on smaller coins, these kinds of attacks are getting more common. In a new report, Group-1B found $20 million worth of crypto theft accomplished with such attacks in 2018, as TNW reported.  On Saturday, October 13, geocold51 decided to display just how easy it was – livestreaming his attempt to 51% attack Bitcoin Private, a crypto with close to a $47 million market cap (at the time of writing).  Speaking to CoinDesk, geocold51 said, if a cryptocurrency can be so easily attacked, ""it's sort of a misvalue of a given currency by different investors.""  Geocold51 estimates he spent $100 to get to the point where he could have done a demonstration double spend on bitcoin private, but he stopped because his livestream got pulled.  Just to be clear, geocold51 wasn't interested in stealing, and so he set up the demonstration where he'd send the bitcoin private he owned to two different wallets he owned. In that way, no user or exchange provider gets ripped off.  For him, it's about displaying that many coins are vulnerable and, therefore, perhaps vastly over-valued.  That said, he estimates that to make a profit off a 51% attack, it would cost a malicious attacker roughly double – so around $200 – to buy some bitcoin on an exchange with his bitcoin private and then make another transaction on the longer chain that invalidates the first transaction, giving him his bitcoin private coins back and leaving the exchange coming up short.  While going through the exchange process costs more, the 51% attack has still become quite economical due to the rise of cloud computing. According to geocold51, without access to cloud mining, an attack like he did on bitcoin private would have cost him about $100,000 in hardware.  ""Nicehash and the ability to rent hashing power fundamentally changes the landscape of 51% attacks,"" geocold51 told CoinDesk, adding:  ""If there's not a lot of hashing power to secure it, but there is a lot of value associated with it, that's where you can do a 51% attack.""  Because geocold51 announced the livestream on Reddit (the post got 1500 upvotes and 60,000 views, he said), the attempted attack got quite a bit of attention – even dogecoin creator Jackson Palmer tweeted about watching.  Still, the livestream didn't work exactly as planned, and because of that, geocold51 said he would run a complete attack later. He told CoinDesk he will do it without a stream this week and release a recording of his demonstration on YouTube shortly after.  The inspiration  The young security researcher's handle might remind some of another security guru.  According to geocold51, he was inspired by one of the most legendary hackers of recent years: geohot, who famously jailbroke the original iPhone, which means the restrictions on carriers and apps were removed.  These days, geohot likes to livestream himself searching for vulnerabilities.  And geocold51 figured he could start doing the same within the cryptocurrency ecosystem.  Geocold51 has a good knowledge of crypto. Back when GPU hardware was still lucrative for hobbyist miners, geocold51 mined quite a bit of bitcoin. He then began trading money on Cryptsy, before the exchange's CEO allegedly walked away with millions of dollars in its user's money.  In that, he lost nearly all his bitcoin.  But he still remained interested in the space, and continued to study up on how it all worked. And as the industry divided into hundreds and thousands of different cryptocurrencies, geocold51 thought he might be able to shine some light on the security pitfalls.  And others were interested in that too. His Reddit post about the challenge garnered 1500 upvotes and over Twitch, he received $888 in donations.  The day of the attack  What's also interesting is that bitcoin private wasn't his first target.  Instead, geocold51 had intended to go after einsteinium, a volunteer-run litecoin fork with a $19 million market cap and $598,000 in trading volume per day, at the time of this writing.  He announced his intent publicly, and as he got ready for the attack, commenters within his Twitch feed noted that the cryptocurrency's hash rate was spiking.  Because he had announced the attack in advance, the einsteinium community boosted the hash rate because it was worried that such an attack could cause a chain split and create a second blockchain that people could get stuck on, according to Ben Kurland, one of the project's board members. At that time, einsteinium was in the middle of a wallet upgrade. If users or exchanges did not upgrade their wallets in time, the blockchain split could have caused property loss.  Seeing the increased hash power, geocold51 decided to attack bitcoin private instead.  According to geocold51, he got over 600 views during the Twitch livestream, before Twitch shut the stream down. The team at Twitch, he said, temporarily suspended him under the ""attempts of threats of harm"" section of its community guidelines.  He got another livestream up on Stream.Me a half-hour later.  Once broadcasting there, he was able to hire miners through Nicehash to mine bitcoin private. In fact, he almost immediately mined a block. And in very little time, he was controlling more than 50 percent of the hash power on the blockchain.  Pretty soon an account called ""CommunityWatch"" popped up in the stream and wrote: ""Just a quick question: I'm assuming everything we are doing here is legal?""  Minutes later, geocold51's video feed on Stream.Me cut out.  Geocold51 told CoinDesk that he had already gotten about two-thirds of the hash rate on bitcoin private. He'd transmitted his first transaction to a second wallet he controlled. And he had written another transaction onto an offline chain that went to a third wallet he controlled.  He was about to send this longer chain to the network, but since the whole point was to show people the attack could be done easily, he stopped once the livestreams shut off.  Protected in another way  Still, geocold51 is determined to follow through with his mission, and so will record his next attack to share on YouTube soon.  And while this vulnerability is likely to be worrying to many in the community, geocold51 noted that there is another way these coins are protected based on cryptocurrency game theory.  If someone tried to sell any significant volume of the coins, their price would likely plummet, since the community isn't robust enough and doesn't have huge amounts of liquidity. As such, geocold51 argued, even if it is easy to buy hash power and take over a network, it might not be feasible to make a lot of money from an attack.  Nevertheless, geocold51 is committed to continuing, using the donations he received to maybe even try to 51% attack more cryptocurrencies as well.  In fact, he told CoinDesk, he may intentionally attack some cryptocurrencies that have set up preventative measures for 51% attacks, to test them in production. For instance, the team developing Horizen (formerly zencash) believes it's found a way to disincentivize 51% attacks by introducing certain miner penalties.  Geocold51 said he would be happy to fail against some of these measures.  Running the demonstrations privately and adding some production value on the final recording will likely make for more edifying content, according to geocold51, but he's still a bit disappointed that his original plan didn't pan out.  To CoinDesk, he concluded:  ""There is something kind of neat about it being live.""  Twitch, Stream.Me and bitcoin private's teams did not reply to a request for comment for this story.

42402069,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3Kdo,1540386062,South Korea's Financial Watchdog Warns Investors Over Crypto Funds,"South Korea's Financial Services Commission has warned the public to exercise caution when investing in cryptocurrency funds.  The FSC issued a note to investors Wednesday, saying cryptocurrency funds have a structure similar to mutual funds and, thus, investors may mistakenly believe such funds are legal investments under the country's Capital Markets Act.  As per the law, funds that raise capital from the public must be approved by and registered with the FSC. However, cryptocurrency funds are neither approved nor registered, the regulator says.  ""Therefore, cryptocurrency funds are subject to Capital Markets Act violation,"" the FSC writes.  The commission further indicates that it plans to take measures regarding crypto funds, after consulting with the relevant authorities, to protect investors from any financial harm.  The note comes after a recent review of crypto funds by South Korean financial regulators that took place last week, as reported by CoinDesk Korea.  As part of the review, the FSC is also reportedly scrutinizing a crypto fund issued by an exchange called Zeniex. Based on the note to investors, the FSC could ultimately hand over the Zeniex case to prosecutors.  The news comes as the Korean regulator is becoming increasingly involved in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space.  In July, the FSC announced that it is setting up a new department dedicated primarily to cryptocurrencies and blockchain – called the Financial Innovation Bureau – to focus on developing policy-making initiatives for the domestic blockchain and fintech industry.

The patent, released Tuesday by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, specifically explains how a blockchain could be used to securely release time-sensitive information when necessary. As the document explains, wire, newswire, news release or other digital distribution services currently share information at pre-set embargo times to the intended outlets.  While existing platforms can already distribute information at specific times and to only the appropriate recipients, the patent notes that these systems may leave audit trail gaps – and some platforms may not be audit-friendly at all.  As such, ""new and improved techniques and systems for delivering and securing such time-sensitive information are continually sought after,"" the document explains.  To solve this, Nasdaq's patent describes a blockchain platform that can utilize smart contracts to both incorporate a number of encryption and workflow features, while maintaining a log that becomes more difficult to change over time.  It explains that the computer system and blockchain are programmed to allow sharing of information directly to selected recipients at a pre-set time by using smart contracts that have been added to the blockchain.  ""Access to the sensitive information that is stored on the blockchain may include a multi-signature requirement that is part of the embedded scripts that make up a given blockchain transaction,"" the patent adds.  ""The intended recipients of the information may then directly interface with the blockchain at the scheduled time ... to access information that has been securely stored,"" it continues.

42402060,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3KWv,1540377017,Japanese Crypto Exchange Group Gets Legal Status to Self-Regulate,"The Financial Services Agency (FSA), Japan's finance regulator, has formally approved a cryptocurrency exchange association as a self-regulatory industry body.  The FSA said in a notice on Wednesday that it has accredited the Japanese Virtual Currency Exchange Association (JVCEA) as a ""certified fund settlement business association,"" a status that will let the body set rules for the nation's exchanges and take action over any violations.  While the group has not announced any rules yet, a recent report from Reuters said it may require member exchanges to hold separate bank deposits and government bonds, based on a draft obtained by the news agency. The move would be aimed to ensure exchanges have sufficient funds to compensate users in the event of a hack.  The association was created by 16 licensed crypto trading platforms in Japan in the wake of a $530 million hack on the Coincheck exchange early this year, and filed an application for approval with the FSA in August.  Recently, the Zaif crypto exchange, one of the 16 licensed platforms, was hacked for $60 million and subsequently had to sign itself over to another firm last month because it did not have enough reserves to refund users for their losses.  The association has previously made other proposals, such as imposing regular audits on crypto exchanges and limiting the amount of borrowing available to margin traders.  In a separate announcement, the FSA also noted it had seen an increasing number of companies expressing interest in applying for a cryptocurrency exchange license. As such, it has updated and released the documents it requires for firms seeking to be licensed.  Exchanges must now complete a 83-page Q&A form that includes details such as a platforms' crypto reserves, offered trading pairs and their maximum leverage ratio in margin trading.  Based on the FSA document, the review process will also focus on security measures taken by exchanges – for instance, whether their platform is developed in-house or whether they use third-party agencies to manage customer outreach and marketing efforts.  The FSA also indicated that after reviewing written submissions it will also conduct on-site inspections at exchanges.  In September, the agency said it was planning to increase staffing levels next year for its cryptocurrency exchange license scheme, stating that over 160 firms were looking to submit applications at the time.

42402081,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3Kne,1540371608,There's Bitcoin Still to Win Locked in This Crypto Puzzle,"Over $1 million in bitcoin was hidden in a picture – and there's still some left to be found.  Called the 310 BTC Bitcoin Challenge, a pseudonymous user going by the name ""Pip"" stashed a total of 310.61 BTC (worth $2,011,267 at press time) into four digital wallets earlier this month – with the recovery code for unlocking each wallet decipherable through careful investigation of a single black-and-white image.  It's a familiar concept within the space. Earlier this year, a crypto enthusiast won $50,000 worth of bitcoin by solving a puzzle in a painting called ""The Legend of Satoshi Nakamoto"" by visual artist turned blockchain developer Marguerite deCourcelle.  Similar to the 310 BTC Bitcoin Challenge, enticing users to find bounties of bitcoin concealed within a computer-generated image, one of Driscoll's puzzles took more than two years to solve.  For Pip, the game, which debuted on October 2, was an experiment, he said, created ""to make someone else happy."" Pip claims to have amassed ""a treasure chest"" of bitcoin largely for free as an early adopter.  His puzzle, though, is already near completion. In fact, within eight days of the challenge being released, three of the four wallets were successfully unlocked and emptied – this including the grand prize allotment of 310 BTC.  Shocked at how quickly the funds were moved, Pip posted on Reddit, ""I'm very surprised and impressed at the same time. For my next challenge, I can clearly beef up overall complexity.""  The web page reports over 400 registered participants – and counting. While the majority of staked funds have been claimed, the challenge is ongoing with one final wallet containing 0.31 BTC, around $2,000, yet to be unlocked.  As such, active discussions among interested parties on not only Reddit but other public channels such as Discord and BitcoinTalk posit different techniques to uncover the remaining secrets hidden in the PNG file.  To crack the code, participants will require a combination of different skills including image manipulation, bytecode manipulation, text encoding and cryptography.  Adding to this, Steve Wilson, a cryptography expert and principal analyst at emerging technologies advisory firm Constellation Research told CoinDesk the final solution could also entail a ""cultural"" understanding specific to open-source development communities.  ""I bet you there are patterns and clues and inside jokes and a culture that might be useful for solving the problem,"" he said, adding:  ""There are probably clues going on here and ways of solving problems that are shared by the community without necessarily being mathematical.""  Below is a recounting of how the first three puzzles were figured out and how those techniques might be used to unlock the last of the bitcoin.  Image forensics  Indeed, Pip himself affirms that part of the solution to the challenge can simply be gleaned through careful inspection of the image by anyone, even ""while on the bus.""  Hinting at techniques used in a branch of cryptography known as steganography, where secret messages are hidden in plain sight, the first step to cracking the code is merely paying attention to image details.  Zooming in on the above image, some have found key pieces of information, such as a date reference to when the challenge first started.  Transforming this image so that it is reflected by a central axis reveal additional clues to suggest the curves and lines superimposed on the mosaic-like grid actually serve to group together different letters and numbers scattered about.  Bitcoin trivia  Another key element to uncovering the last remaining code is knowing what to look for in context of how bitcoin storage works.  There's a variety of different digital wallets able to hold bitcoins, or rather bitcoin private keys, indicating de facto ownership. Among the many ways a user might ensure safe holding of their tokens, a grouping of 12, 18 or 24 words – together called a ""seed phrase"" – can be randomly generated and used as the ultimate recovery password to gain wallet access.  From a previous solution to a holding of 0.1 BTC, the seed phrase for one of the wallets in the challenge was: cry buyer grain save vault sign lyrics rhythm music fury horror mansion.  And as most bitcoin enthusiasts will know, the possible words that make up these seed phrases are compiled in multi-language lists found on Github repositories of bitcoin improvement proposals.  Therefore, in order to unlock the remaining bitcoin wallet, challenge participants will likely have to put together the correct combination of words to compose a bitcoin seed phrase relying upon one or more of these Github word lists.  Computer programming  It's unavoidable. There likely does require some knowledge of code manipulation in order to complete this challenge.  For example, participants so far have relied on a programming operation known as bit shifting in order to decode messages found within the challenge image.  As background, bit shifting essentially moves a value – be it a binary value composed of ones and zeroes or a hexadecimal value composed of numbers and letters – either to the left or to the right by a set amount, much like how you would add or subtract in basic mathematics.  Looking closely at the original image, there is a grid of hexadecimal values that can be converted using a common shift key such as the challenge start date and then transformed into a new set of values.  Given this grid's use case for other wallet solutions, it is likely that operations in the same vein as bit shifting will be required to further decode the message behind these values.  Finally, cryptography  Last but not least, this would not be a bitcoin challenge without emphasis on techniques used by computer science professionals and cryptographers.  So far, challenge participants have leveraged an open-source software known as OpenSSL, or the Open Secure Sockets Layer, to decrypt part of the challenge solutions.  Speaking to the highly popular use case for the technology, Constellation Research's Wilson explained that in essence, OpenSSL is ""a code library that helps you secure your website,"" adding, ""It's being used by essentially every web server.""  Indeed, the unique code base and commands of OpenSSL able to encrypt web communications has also been used to similarly encrypt digital wallet codes as part of Pip's bitcoin challenge.  Knowing all this, the remaining task of deciphering the last piece to the 310 BTC Bitcoin Challenge is most likely a mixture of these techniques. Good luck!

The investment comes from a ""broad global investment group representing the venture capital, cryptocurrency and financial services communities,"" according to a press release published Wednesday.  The company told CoinDesk in an email that, with the new capital, it's now planning to further expand its engineering team as it moves towards the protocol's launch.  The new funding comes months after Algorand secured $4 million in a seed founding round from Pillar and Union Square Ventures.  The firm said at the time that it was planning to increase its development team for a planned roll-out later in 2018. A test network for the Algorand protocol was launched in July, and the first open-source code was released on Github in October, according to previous statements.  Micali, an MIT professor with expertise in cryptography, first revealed his proof-of-stake design for the Algorand protocol in 2017.  By providing no incentives in the protocol– as opposite to major blockchain networks like bitcoin and ethereum which generate block rewards for miners – Micali said the goal of Algorand is to achieve both scalability and security, so that the protocol can be reliably used by large enterprises.  Also as part of funding round announcement, the company said it has hired two former senior executives from technology firms to lead the company's operations.  Steve Kokinos, former co-founder of a Boston-based cloud service firm Fuze, has become the company's CEO, while W. Sean Ford, a former CMO of software provider LogMeIn, comes on board as Algorand's chief operating officer.

42402077,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3Kji,1540360823,Indian Police Seize ATM Run By Crypto Exchange Unocoin,"Police in the Indian city of Bangalore have seized an ATM just weeks after it was set up by local cryptocurrency exchange Unocoin.  The Times of India said in a news report on Wednesday that Harish BV, co-founder and chief technology officer of the Unocoin exchange, was arrested on Tuesday while attending to the crypto ATM, which was installed in a shopping mall and revealed on Oct. 14.  According to the report, the Central Crime Branch of the local police force seized the ATM, two laptops, a mobile, three credit cards, five debit cards, a passport and Indian rupees worth about $2,500.  Unocoin is one of several cryptocurrency exchanges in India that have so-far survived a bank ban issued early this year by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the country's central banking authority.  As domestic banks stopped offering financial services to cryptocurrency exchanges, Unocoin launched the ATM to allow investors to directly deposit Indian rupees to their accounts with the exchange. The company said last week it was planning to open several more ATMs in Mumbai and Delhi.  Yet, the police claimed Unocoin is not authorized to operate this type of ATM.  In another news report from Bangalore Mirror on Wednesday, Alok Kumar, a commissioner from the Bangalore city police was quoted as saying that Unocoin did not have a license from the RBI, the Securities and Exchange Board of India ""or any other agency"" allowing it to carry out bitcoin transactions.  ""They were running it without obtaining any trade license from the BBMP [Bangalore government],"" he said.  However, Unocoin's co-founder and CEO Sathvik Viswanath, denied this accusation, saying in the Times of India report.  ""The [Finance] Minister's statement was clear: cryptocurrencies are not legal tender in India. He did not say 'illegal tender'. There's a huge difference. It means you bear the risk of your investment and there's no regulation for the industry.""  Unocoin has not responded to CoinDesk's request for further comment on the issue.

42402071,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3Kgl,1540353637,Boost VC Just Fulfilled a Crypto Funding Pledge 4 Years in the Making,"Boost VC has officially backed crypto startup number 100.  With the news, confirmed Tuesday by CoinDesk, the San Mateo incubator has finally fulfilled a funding pledge made all the way back in March 2014, when co-founders Adam Draper and Brayton Williams boldly declared they would invest in 100 bitcoin startups over the next three years.  Though it may have taken a bit longer than planned, the milestone is perhaps a testament to the pre-seed fund, which has maintained a major emphasis on crypto since its earliest days, riding the twists and turns of an industry that has changed greatly in just a few short years.  And that's reflected in the numbers. Depending on how the deals get counted, Boost VC now says it's made a little over 100 crypto investments. A few of its companies have pivoted away from crypto over time, so Draper no longer counts those toward the total, even if Boost initially wrote its check with the technology in mind.  To that end, however, Draper told CoinDesk in an interview that the philosophy of the fund hasn't changed.  ""It has always been about building the open financial system of the world,"" he said.  But a few pivots aren't a bearish indicator – that's the national course of investing. For Draper, the crypto portfolio has been a strong net positive.  ""In 2017, we started to feel the potential of what this could be, and now that potential is actually being built,"" he said.  He acknowledged that enthusiasm has dwindled among his peers in the venture community, but Boost has been through this before. He promised, ""We will be writing more checks, because that's my favorite time.""  And despite hitting its goal, Boost hasn't quit seeking crypto deals.  Right now, it wants applications for its incubator, which is just one part of its larger investing program. Applications are open for ""Tribe 12"" now through the end of October (each group of startups goes into a ""tribe,"" and this will be the 12th such group).  It's looking for 20 companies to join a three-month incubator, where they will be provided with housing and office space, entrepreneurship coaching and a check from $50 to $100,000.  Results so far  ""It's been super fun,"" Draper said of the ride to 100 companies. ""You went from being the crazy one to having a group of people who were all crazy with you.""  When Boost made its 100 investment commitment, he said it attracted all kinds of talented entrepreneurs starved for funding and support to Boost. He said they felt like ""a beacon,"" attracting this gang of believers together in a basement to imagine a new industry.  Three years later, and it has become a real tech sector, with real stakes in the economy. Draper broke down some of the big takeaways from its pool of investments so far.  Additional rounds of funding have been secured by 45 percent of the companies they backed, while 25 percent of the companies are dead. It's had five crypto exits: Lawnmower (data), Leet (e-sports), Bitquick (distribution), Bitwall (micropayments) and Clevercoin (exchange). (Lawnmower was acquired by CoinDesk).  Swell Rewards, also exited, but that's an example of a company that Boost backed as a crypto company but that pivoted away from crypto by the time it sold.  The exits so far don't necessarily indicate big successes though. Venture capital typically looks at a 10-year time horizon for its bets to pay off. So far, its best investments (companies like Protocol Labs, Aragon, Ripio and Wyre) haven't even approached an exit, because they are just building and growing.  Boost's failures, Draper said, resulted in focusing on ideas over founders. When an idea was hot and so it rushed to find a founder who was working on that idea, those deals never worked. Now Boost always picks founders over ideas.  In Draper's view, he's always looking for founders that iterate. He wants to see constant iteration on product, getting it closer and closer to the users' true problem. Also, he wants to see founders constant iterating on themselves, working to become the leader their company needs.  Draper said, ""Their reason for being in it needs to be pretty strong.""  From bitcoin to crypto  Close watchers of the space will note that there is one way in which Boost amended its pledge. In March 2014, when Draper committed to making 100 investments, he actually said he'd back 100 bitcoin startups. Since then, a lot of the companies its counting are definitely crypto, but they aren't necessarily built for bitcoin.  ""The idea of 100 bitcoin companies — when we announced we were going to back 100 bitcoin companies — that was insane. That was an insane thought,"" Draper said. At that time there really wasn't a distinction between bitcoin and other kinds of crypto, Draper explained.  ""There was bitcoin and these whispers of other things, but everyone was trying to keep people focused on the main one,"" he said. ""We felt that the industry hadn't focused enough to support divisions in the ecosystem.""  Draper said that was an era when he watched ""early adopters being rejected by venture capital,"" he said. ""I remember other VCs coming up to me and being like: 'Is that bitcoin thing still a thing?'""  But then ethereum came along and it offered the ERC-20 smart contract, which opened up a new way for funding starved crypto companies to raise money. ""It unlocked this door in everyone's head that said, 'Hey maybe there can be more than one,'"" he recalled.  So, Boost followed the trend and opened up what it was looking for. Mostly it gets equity stakes in companies it backs, but it has also done token deals, such as for Decentraland. Draper said: ""We have really done every kind of deal in the space.""  Right now, it's focused on getting those very early deals, from very new companies it will bring into its incubator. It really emphasizes the fact that it provides both housing and office space, because unlike a lot of VCs it seeks companies from all over the world.  Half of Boost's portfolio is international, Draper said, explaining, ""Which, just working in the cryptocurrency world, you just have to be.""  It's also key to get them started in Silicon Valley because, he said, ""Our thesis has always been: Entrepreneurs are everywhere but Silicon Valley has an infrastructure for founding a company that's very, very helpful.""  As for what he's looking for, he and his partners keep an open mind.  He said:  ""We're looking for the craziest most impassioned people building magic.""
