42399058,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiCJd,1464817449,Blockchain Evangelists Plot Retreat to Richard Branson's Island,"Richard Branson’s private island in the Caribbean is set to host yet another blockchain-focused gathering, drawing a range of guests from around the world including the former prime minister of Haiti and a member of the European Union Parliament.  Among the approximately 40 people attending this year’s event is Marietje Schaake, the member of European Parliament who in March hosted an event with COALA (Coalition of Automated Legal Applications) and the Dynamic Coalition on Blockchain Technologies at the Internet Governance Forum (IGF) to explore the prospect of coding regulation into a blockchain.  Also on the guest list are Beth Moses, engineer and astronaut for Branson's aerospace firm Virgin Galactic; Laurent Lamothe, former prime minister of Haiti; Jim Newsome, former chairman of the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission; and Elizabeth Rossiello, CEO of bitcoin startup BitPesa.  The event is being hosted by bitcoin mining firm BitFury and event group Mai Tai.  Now in its second year, little seems to have changed about the Blockchain Summit hosted on Branson’s Necker Island in spite of controversy around last year’s gathering. While some argued the group of attendees was elitist in nature, the mix of education and leisure has proved productive in more than one way, according to past attendees.  BitFury CEO Valery Vavilov described the proceedings in a very similar terms as last year, though with a few tweaks, noting in a statement:  ""Our emphasis for this year’s gathering is to bring some of the world’s top thinkers from diverse backgrounds – civil society, [non-governmental organizations], business, technology, government – to this extremely special place known for free thinking and cutting edge innovation.""  On the island  From 3rd to 7th June, guests will attend panels dealing with the event’s three major themes: financial technology, security and global change.  But plenty of free time is also built into the agenda. While it may be tempting to imagine margaritas on the beach filling that time, the leisure has a much more intentional function, organizers say.  Former senior White House staffer and BitFury global chief of communications Jamie Smith told CoinDesk the downtime is intended to fuel a more collaborative environment between participants.  ""Once people are given an opportunity to explore new and interesting ideas and have open conversations,"" said Smith.  ""You never know what can come of that and that’s really exciting for us and those who are attending.""  Building connections  Yet, last year's event was not without controversy, with allegations of both elitism and sexism. At this year's event, BitFury says it will strive to help cover attendees unable to pay the price tag, and a partial guest list obtained by CoinDesk shows that was almost half this year's attendee list is comprised of women.  As far as the actual results of last year's event, the results have arguably been mixed. While little is known about the future of the “mining lightbulb” product unveiled at last year’s Summit, two concrete milestones were achieved.  A conversation started at last year’s event by economist Hernando de Soto about the use of blockchain for land titles culminated in April with a project by BitFury to develop a land registry program in the nation of Georgia. De Soto is now an advisor to BitFury.  Further, Jason Weinstein, a partner at law firm Steptoe & Johnston, took the concept for what is now called the Blockchain Alliance to last year’s event, telling CoinDesk that the relationships formed there were “critical” to its founding.  Weinstein said:  ""The setting and format at Necker gives you a chance to really engage with all of the other attendees over the course of several days and nights and to share ideas and figure out how to turn those ideas into action.""

42399059,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiCKc,1464814130,Prenup Built in Ethereum Smart Contract Rethinks Marriage Obligations,"Thanks to a new prenuptial agreement uploaded to the Ethereum blockchain, your insistence on watching The Walking Dead could be a violable offense.  So, too, could the frequency at which you shop, the number of chores you do, and your preference to your mother’s spaghetti recipe over your spouse’s.  Designed by soon-to-be newlyweds Gaurang Torvekar and Sayalee Kaluskar, the open-source PrenupWithLove smart contract has been stored on the Ethereum network for anyone to see and use.  As Torvekar and Kaluskar wrote on their website:  ""While talking about blockchains and its endless possibilities, we thought of using it to solve our day to day problems. As we are getting married this December, we immediately thought of a putting our pre-nup on the blockchain as a ""smart"" solution.""  A prenuptial agreement effectively establishes the ground rules for a marriage before the ceremony takes place. Typically, couples use these agreements to dictate how shared assets will be divided in the event of a divorce.  How it works  To establish the arrangement, the couple uploaded a prenuptial template with the couple’s “covenants” onto the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). The contents of that document were then encoded into a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain.  Before the contract is initiated, both parties must accept the terms and conditions by calling the method ""accept"" from their own personal IP addresses. Their acceptance is also stored within the contract.  The template agreement encoded in the contract lists a number of requirements to which the two must adhere.  These include the requirement that every 10 days, 100 minutes must be spent on a date night, that shopping sprees shall be limited to once per fortnight ""unless it’s for food"", and that Kaluskar must agree to watch The Walking Dead after Torvekar finishes watching every season of Seinfeld.  The future of smart contracts?  Over the past year, the idea of a smart contract that digitally triggers any number of events based on pre-agreed metrics has risen to prominence largely in the financial sector, where stock transfers could occur automatically based on criteria decided beforehand, for example.  But the legal status of these contracts is still largely debated. Ethereum Foundation advisor and author of Business Blockchain William Mougayar argued in April that smart contracts are currently not enforceable under the law, even if they do enable increased automation.  As the legal definition of smart contracts changes and entrepreneurs push the limits, other examples are also on the horizon, not just in finance, but in law and corporate governance.  Yet outside of those potential applications, for now, the technology is finding use in unlikely places, such as the forthcoming marriage for Torvekar, the co-founder and CTO of smart contracts startup Attores, and Kaluskar, who works as an art director at branding agency Ogilvy & Mather.  The couple wrote on their site:  ""The next time when we have to decide which show to watch on Netflix, this is where we can find the tamper proof, single source of truth – that no coder or a photoshop master can manipulate.""

42399063,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiCOY,1464803133,Abu Dhabi Regulators Seek Blockchain Startups for FinTech Sandbox,"The independent regulatory authority of Abu Dhabi's newest financial free zone is seeking to promote the development of blockchain startups as part of a drive to create new efficiencies in the regional financial sector.  The Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA), one of three divisions of the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), has released a consultation paper in which it detailed its plans to create a sandbox environment for FinTech under which startups would be allowed to work under a flexible regulatory framework for up to two years.  The FSRA's proposal would seek to limit startups accepted into the program to those that ""promote significant growth, efficiency or competition in the financial sector"", though the paper goes on to cite examples of technologies that fit this description.  The paper reads:  ""The advent of robo-advisers that offer lower costs, simplicity and real-time portfolio analytics and monitoring; or leveraging on the application of blockchain technology and distributed databases to facilitate price discovery, smart contracts, settlement of financial transactions, etc that may lead to safer [and] better products, and higher productivity and growth.""  Notably, the proposal follows growing enthusiasm for blockchain in the UAE. In Dubai, for example, more than 30 regional startups, government agencies and regional enterprise businesses have come together so far this year to begin working on proofs-of-concept with the technology.  Raza Rizvi, a UAE-based commercial IP lawyer with Simmons & Simmons, sees the development as perhaps more indicative of Abu Dhabi’s wider push to attract enterprise financial institutions, though he said the initiatives could prove synergistic.  ""No doubt the two independent initiatives will bring out the best in each other and enable the UAE as a whole to lead the way in the FinTech sector and usage of blockchain technology in the Middle East,"" he said.  Launched in late 2015, ADGM has been increasingly active in recent months, appointing a regulatory committee in January and signing an agreement with FinTech accelerator Flat6Labs earlier this week that will find the startup incubator working with the regulator on fostering innovation.  The efforts are seen as part of a long-term strategy to attract the financial services industry to the UAE capital with incentives including full foreign ownership and tax exemptions.

42378694,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lZgT,1464799000,Industry Observers Say Coinbase's Ethereum Embrace a ‘No Brainer',"For some market observers, the embrace of Ethereum by exchange and wallet startup Coinbase was a long time coming.  Last month, the co-founder of one of the most heavily funded bitcoin startups, Coinbase, announced that its digital currency exchange would start trading ethers, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network. The move came after the startup hosted creator Vitalik Buterin at its headquarters for a presentation on Ethereum this March.  Yet, it was the way co-founder Fred Ehrsam released the news – with a complete rebrand to one of the company’s core products accompanied by a strongly worded blog post that warned of bitcoin’s susceptibility to Ethereum, that triggered a strong response throughout the digital currency community.  Coinbase later said it accepted more than 2 million ethers in new deposits on its first day of accepting the digital currency. At the same time, critics of the move took to social media to voice frustration over what some perceived to be a betrayal of the company's initial user base.  But according to some industry observers, the decision was ultimately a practical one, following other startups in the bitcoin space that have begun developing products around Ethereum.  A logical step  Gil Luria, head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, believes that Coinbase’s decision to enable Ethereum trades on its GDAX platform is in alignment with the company’s commitment to provide access to ""whatever cryptocurrency made the most sense for its users"".  But it is Ethereum’s potential use for managing smart contracts, prediction markets and decentralized organizations that Luria thinks most distinguished it for Coinbase.  Luria told CoinDesk:  ""[Coinbase] avoided me-too altcoins such as Litecoin, but [it] looks like they believe Ethereum is different. Since Ethereum has the potential to add significant functionality that may not be available on the bitcoin network, and since there is clearly robust demand for ethers, it makes sense for Coinbase to expand into ethers.""  Author Alex Tapscott argued that the reason Coinbase pursued an integration with Ethereum was because doing so offered both long- and short-term benefits.  ""Volumes are skyrocketing and so too will their fees, but more importantly putting a stake in the ground here is critical as I expect Coinbase will want to participate in the [decentralized applications] that get built on top of this new blockchain,"" he said.  A chink in the armor  As can be expected, prominent supporters and participants in the Ethereum project were more bullish on the move.  Speaking with CoinDesk, Ethereum co-founder Anthony Di Iorio described Coinbase’s entry into the Ethereum marketplace as a ""no-brainer"" based on the number and range of third-party projects being built on the platform.  Di Iorio, CEO of wallet software developer KryptoKit, said Coinbase's acceptance of another digital currency is the latest step in what he sees as an ongoing trend.  Di Iorio said:  ""The more blockchains the better, the more competition the better. I think you’re going to start seeing every company turning into a multi-currency, multi-token system.""  Meanwhile, Peter Luce, principal at blockchain consulting firm Ouroboros LLP, partially credited another Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin for being ""somewhat of a benevolent dictator"", and driving the network's success in closing the gap with bitcoin.  But Luce also blamed a lack of direction in the bitcoin community that led to opportunities not only for Ethereum but Ripple, R3CEV, Hyperledger and others.  ""Bitcoin has failed to emerge as a fiat currency killer not because governments have succeeded at suppressing it,"" said Luce. ""But because its benefits for the average citizen are, today, not nearly compelling enough to lead to mass adoption.""  Developer mindshare  But, not every market observer sees Ethereum beating out bitcoin's first-mover advantage.  Researcher Spencer Bogart of investment bank Needham & Company called Coinbase’s decision to embrace Ethereum a smart way to diversify the company’s product offering, while still leveraging its existing digital currency exchange infrastructure.  Bogart, however, downplayed Ehrsam’s warning that Ethereum’s functionality, including a scripting language that makes it easier to build applications, was a possible threat to bitcoin’s first-mover advantage.  ""It doesn’t mean Ethereum will overcome Bitcoin’s first-mover advantage and succeed in attracting a critical mass of developer mindshare,"" Bogart said, adding:  ""In fact, everything I’m seeing shows that bitcoin still has significantly greater developer mind-share than Ethereum.""  By the numbers  Opinions aside, markets for both digital currencies continue to attract attention.  The move by Coinbase to accept Ethereum came amid a period of heightened trade volume in both ether and bitcoins markets, the latter of which has seen accelerated price gains in recent days.  While bitcoin enjoyed a relatively strong week last week – appreciating by about 4% prior to this weekend's price jump – the price of ether fell, tumbling roughly 14% in the seven days leading up to 27th May.  At press time, ether is trading at a price of roughly $14 on data from US-based exchange Poloniex, while the price of bitcoin is approximately $536, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin USD Price Index.  Long-term market capitalizations highlight the trajectory of growth as well. At the time of the Ethereum crowdsale, which ended in August 2014, bitcoin's market cap was approximately $7.6bn, according to data from CoinMarketCap.com.  While bitcoin's market cap has largely remained the same, reaching more than $8bn today, Ethereum's market cap has climbed to over $1bn since inception.

42378698,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lZlV,1464793203,R3 Publishes Vitalik Buterin Report on Ethereum for Banks,"R3CEV has released a new report evaluating how the alternative blockchain platform Ethereum could be used by banks engaged in consortium and private blockchain initiatives.  Penned by Ethereum inventor Vitalik Buterin, the more than 40-page report provides a technical overview of Ethereum’s architecture and applications in finance, as well as an analytical look at how financial institutions can seek to build private blockchains using the technology and the issues they may face in doing so.  For those uncomfortable navigating the sometimes dense language more common to white papers, the publication coincides with a shorter executive summary authored by R3 chief scientist Richard Gendal Brown and strategy lead Kathleen Breitman. The companion piece, also released today, explains the impetus for the report as well as the high-level takeaways for less technical readers.  As described by R3 head of research Tim Swanson, the report was commissioned due to the volume of requests the startup was receiving from its banking partners for information on Ethereum and its novel and highly publicized features such as smart contracts.  Swanson further sought to position the publication as a sign that R3 is committed to following developments in the wider public blockchain ecosystem, even if its proposed solutions like the smart contracts platform Corda, differ in approach.  Swanson told CoinDesk:  ""The idea is to keep track of platforms and go beyond the superficial. These platforms weren’t designed for regulated financial institutions, [but] that’s not to say that things can’t change. We’re being methodical.""  Both Swanson and Breitman contend that the research helps position R3 as a thought leader in the space, as well as a collaborator across an industry in which all members are working to solve difficult challenges related to the use of blockchain tech.  In his written remarks, Brown struck a similar tone, describing Ethereum as a ""remarkable achievement"", one that he believes can serve as a guide for those prototyping blockchain-based solutions.  However, he cautioned that it may ultimately prove problematic for financial institutions to ""appropriate"" technologies such as Ethereum that were designed for different purposes into the requirements of traditional finance.  Scaling challenges  The report is perhaps most notable as it provides a unique window into how Buterin believes the Ethereum platform could be utilized by financial services firms. The publication follows a test of Ethereum by 11 major banks, conducted by R3 in January of this year.  In his writing, Buterin identified the scalability of the Ethereum platform as a primary concern, though one that is being worked on by all innovators in the ecosystem. In this light, he advocated that institutions should begin working with newer improvements planned for the Ethereum network aimed at addressing this problem.  Of particular note, Buterin said, is that institutions investigate state channels, the payment channel technology that would seek to enable high volumes of Ethereum exchanges to take place off the main blockchain, before settling to this layer; and take steps to implement sharding within their blockchain-based systems.  Buterin wrote:  ""Institutions concerned about scalability have two primary routes: (i) explore the option of building as much of the application logic as possible inside of state channels, whether on a public or private chain, and (ii) implement EIP 105 in a private-chain Ethereum version, and use asynchronous programming with the sharding mechanism to achieve parallelizability.""  Both technologies are not scheduled to be implemented on the live Ethereum blockchain until the launch of Serenity, the release scheduled after its forthcoming Metropolis update. No release date has been set for either upgrade.  However, Buterin noted that institutions are able to implement planned features in private versions of technology, though they may be doing so at a time when such features are still being refined by the Ethereum development community.  Buterin further provided a high-level look at why this problem is inherent in the architecture of modern blockchain platforms.  ""Blockchains are unique in that the specific kind of decentralization that they provide is one of a different character – one that is not distributed, in the sense of 'split up between different parties', but replicated: every single node on the network processes every transaction and maintains the entire state,"" he writes.  Privacy improvements  Buterin also prioritized a discussion of privacy, a topic that has emerged as a hotly debated issue following public musings of those working closely to the financial industry.  Blockchain environments, these experts contend, are today not suited for use by consortium efforts, as doing so could lead banks to share business sensitive data.  Buterin, however, notes that, in his view, private blockchains are not a solution to privacy. In part, his argument puts forth the idea that blockchains are naturally environments for data sharing and management, and that engaging in those environments comes with certain inherent trade-offs.  ""If your primary information security concern is that you want privacy, and you are not interested in getting into advanced crypto or at least moderately complex cryptoeconomic mechanisms such as state channels, then you likely want a server and not a blockchain,"" Buterin wrote.  Buterin asserts that those working on private blockchains have two options when faced with this challenge. They can work to minimize revealing links between information shared in a blockchain environment, or develop advanced solutions that would enable privacy to be ""mathematically provable"".  He continued by noting that either option presents challenges that will require creative thinking by those interested in playing an active part in finding solutions.  Overall, however, he presented optimism that Ethereum would come to introduce solutions to these roadblocks, with his descriptions of the platform seeking to convey the sheer scale and complexity that this undertaking will require.  Buterin wrote:  ""The long-term goal for Ethereum 2.0 and 3.0 is for the protocol to quite literally be able to maintain a blockchain capable of processing Visa-scale transaction levels, or even several orders of magnitude higher, using a network consisting of nothing but a sufficiently large set of users running nodes on consumer laptops.""

42378712,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7la37,1464764359,"A16z, USV Lead $1.5 Million Round for Blockchain Startup Mediachain","New York-based Mediachain has become the latest blockchain startup to join the portfolios of VC heavyweights Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures.  The two firms announced today that they led a $1.5m seed round for the digital media startup. RRE Ventures, Digital Currency Group and LDV Capital also participated in the round, as did angel investors Alexis Ohanian, William Mougayar, Kanyi Maqubela, David Lee, Mathieu Drouin and Brian Message.  The funding comes four months after the launch of Mediachain’s core product, a metadata protocol that envisions content creators timestamping their work to the bitcoin blockchain while also storing it with the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS).  In interview, Mediachain Labs co-founders Jesse Walden and Denis Nazarov expressed their enthusiasm for joining the portfolios of VCs that have backed some of the ecosystem’s boldest bets, including Internet of Things startup 21 Inc and Coinbase, a bitcoin brokerage turned digital asset exchange.  Still, Mediachain's founders see this as ""positive pressure"" that will encourage their work on open data management.  Walden told CoinDesk:  ""There’s a lot of collaboration across the community. We’re all helping each other, so joining this portfolio among these other name-brand projects is a boon for us and an incentive to learn more.""  The investment is also indicative of an emerging strategy that finds Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Venture showing a preference for backing developer teams working on open-source blockchain technologies that seek to apply bitcoin's design principles to new business problems.  In June of last year, for example, the firms both backed OB1, the team behind the decentralized e-commerce platform OpenBazaar.  While surprising given OpenBazaar’s connotations with the defunct dark market Silk Road, the move has nonetheless proven to be a savvy one. OpenBazaar has gained significant traction since its April launch, having been downloaded more than 100,000 times as of mid-May.  Nazarov sees Mediachain as a peer of these open-source projects, given that it ultimately hopes to be a platform for other innovators.  ""We built this infrastructure for new kinds of innovation, and it just does not exist in the projects that exist today,"" he said.  Understanding Mediachain  So, what is Mediachain exactly? In the words of its founders, it's a bid to solve what to date has been an ""impossible problem"" on the Internet – helping those who create digital media to associate their identity with their works.  While one might be tempted to think of it as a tool for reducing ""copyright infringement"", Nazarov and Walden don’t go that far in interview.  Rather, they envision Mediachain as a tool that would enable those who want to share digital media to find and locate the artists whose work they love. In this way, the founders perhaps see the core problem as being the loss of identity that has come with a culture where GIFs and remixes are freely exchanged.  ""We created Mediachain not as a rights registry, but it’s more of a knowledge base that preserves information about attribution and information about its creator,"" Walden said.  To jumpstart this process, Mediachain is prioritizing the cataloging of images from public organizations such as The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) and for-profit image databases such as Getty Images. However, they stressed the platform is open source, and can be used by anyone who wants to participate.  Growing the team  Today, Medichain has seven employees, and Nazarov and Walden don’t see that changing with the new funding round.  Rather, Walden said the capital will be put towards project development, including service and applications that can then encourage more users.  ""As we approach the launch of the Mediachain Alpha network, we’ll be able to devote some of our resources to building some of those applications and services,"" he said, adding:  ""More importantly, we’re really interested in building the community around the project.""  The founders see those who want to build media applications as the first adopters of the project, and the size of the problem Mediachain is attacking as enough to attract developers.  Yet, Walden categorized the startup in terms that certainly put its scope on par with its peers in the Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures portfolios.  He concluded:  ""We hope that Mediachain will one day become the universal library for all media ever created.""
