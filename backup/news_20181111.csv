42402165,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3a39,1541936416,Why Traders Should Chart the Entire Crypto Market Cap,"Market capitalization gets a lot flack for being a poor metric to measure the value of a cryptocurrency – and perhaps rightly so – but that shouldn't stop traders from using it as a tool to generate a market bias.  To summarize: the market capitalization of a cryptocurrency is a function of market price multiplied by the circulating supply, so its fluctuating value ends up visually mimicking that of price action when plotted on a price chart. And if it mimics price action, then technical analysis – the study of market behavior via price movement – can be applied to it just as if the price chart for bitcoin (BTC) was being analyzed.  It's no secret that cryptocurrencies are highly speculative assets that all bank on the widespread adoption of blockchain and distributed ledger technology (DLT). Since the entire market is so reliant on the success of this factor, it's rare for the trends of individual cryptocurrencies to deviate too far from one another for too long.  In other words, they are highly correlated, so if one cryptocurrency goes up or down in price, the others are soon likely to follow.  For the swing trader or long-term investor who does not care about intraday price fluctuations, charting the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies or just alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) can be an insightful way to analyze the long-term trend or bias of the broader market.  As it turns out, the total capitalization of the altcoin market is at an interesting technical juncture that could soon lead to another boom or bust for the market, which is further analyzed below through the use of technical analysis.  Weekly Chart  If we perform a simple technical analysis of the total capitalization of the altcoin market and connect the two major peaks in 2018, a long-term diagonal downtrend line is created.  In technical analysis, breaking a trendline to the upside is a bullish indication and hints the overarching trend is beginning change. The longer-term the trendline, though, the harder it is to break.  As can be seen in the above weekly chart, the capitalization came very close to touching the trendline but has since pulled back, as indicated by the visible upper wick.  Looking at weekly candlesticks from January and May, another rejection from the trendline could lead to a significant sell-off, whereas a weekly close above the trendline would suggest the long-term trend of the altcoin market is beginning to shift from bearish to bullish.  Daily Chart  While the weekly chart displays a major resistance hurdle that needs to break for a longer-term market trend reversal to take place, the daily chart reveals a nearer-term perspective on the outlook of the market, which has its own obstacles.  The pattern highlighted in the above chart is known as an inverse head and shoulders pattern which is a common 'bottom' or reversal pattern.  The pattern is comprised of three successive troughs, with the first and the third being similar in width and depth yet more shallow than the middle trough, known as the head.  In order for the reversal to take effect, the market capitalization would need to find acceptance above the neckline that was created by connecting the peaks on either side of the head with a trendline.  If successful, the depth of the head can be added to the breakout point to set a potential target. The depth of the head here is $34 billion, so if we add that to an anticipated breakout point, the market would have the potential for a 31 percent increase towards $141 billion in the not too distance future.  The Fibonacci retracement levels could be used as intermediate resistance levels, the nearest of which is the 0.382 retracement near $114 billion.  View  The chart for market capitalization mimics that of price action and can be used to provide a broad perspective on the entire market.  Finding acceptance above the inverse head and shoulder neckline would create a mid-term target for $141 billion, whereas breaking the weekly downtrend would suggest a longer-term bearish to a bullish trend change.  Another rejection from the weekly downtrend would increase the chance of a broader market sell-off.  Disclosure: The author holds BTC, AST, REQ, OMG, FUEL, 1st and AMP at the time of writing.

42402151,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3ZqM,1541935830,A 7-Year Legal Fight Led This Dev to Build Unstoppable Ethereum Storage,"""If you build it strong enough, the law will follow.""  That's how Daniel Nagy, the lead developer behind Swarm – ethereum's decentralized storage-layer – described his ""takeaway lesson"" after a seven-year legal battle over his use of an early file-sharing network called Direct Connect (DC).  A precursor to peer-to-peer file sharing service Bittorrent, DC is a technology that is now ""perfectly and completely obsolete,"" according to the developer.  Accused of copyright infringement for hosting a DC node, ""I had a bit of a legal fight over it and I won,"" he told CoinDesk.  In the aftermath of that fight, Nagy – who founded a digital rights institute inspired by the Electronic Frontier Foundation in Hungary – joined the Ethereum Foundation, where he was inspired to look deeper into censorship-resistant technology for file storage.  In particular, Nagy's experience in the courts initiated his work on Swarm, a hotly anticipated storage layer for ethereum, where he focuses on systems architecture and privacy-preserving cryptography.  With Swarm, Nagy is fixated on how to make decentralized storage robust enough that legal repercussions of this kind can't happen – in what he describes as ""an arms race"" between developers and regulators.  ""This is an arms race, and since we can develop stuff and the marginal cost of replication is zero, we will win this arms race, and I think everybody knows that,"" he told CoinDesk.  An ethereum initiative that has been active since the early days of the platform, Swarm seeks to provide a mechanism for the blockchain to offload some of its historical data, as well as handle file-storage more broadly.  With an emphasis on ""efficiency, speed, confidentiality, and security,"" the decentralized storage-layer is built with the aim of rendering the cost of attack so expensive that the legal system is forced to update itself in response.  According to Nagy, that's because a fully robust network, ""can actually inform decision making, even to the point of how law is interpreted by judges and enforcers.""  He told CoinDesk:  ""They don't want to enforce unenforceable laws.""  Unstoppable storage  Intended to provide a base infrastructure for a decentralized internet, Swarm splits information up between the computers of different network participants.  To protect this layer from censorship – what Nagy defines as taking information out of circulation – decentralization and privacy are vital.  For example, what developers call ""redundancy"" is key to how Swarm protects against censorship. This refers to the duplication of critical system components of a system – creating, in effect, a ""swarm"" of machines.  ""If you have multiple channels of communication, multiple locations of storage, then censoring becomes more expensive because you need to find all of them and shut down all of them,"" he told CoinDesk.  While it's possible to store information in a transparent way on Swarm, much of Nagy's work has focused on how to ensure sensitive information remains private, even when stored on someone else's computer.  To do this, Swarm uses what is called ""counter mode"" encryption. If there's a dispute, the protocol shares a small piece of encrypted data that can verify ownership without revealing any other information.  In order to access the stored information remotely, Swarm uses public and private key pairs.  As such, participants will host encrypted data chunks on their laptops, and in most jurisdictions, can do so with a degree of plausible deniability – also meaning that, because Swarm nodes don't hold the keys to unlock data, they won't be at risk of legal trouble.  According to Nagy, that's important because attack-resistant storage is essential to healthy societies.  ""Storage is the shared experience of humanity,"" he told CoinDesk, adding:  ""The difference between hunter gatherers and us is exclusively the amount of stored information that we have access to. There is no other difference between us.""  Future directives  The storage protocol is currently in public alpha, meaning that while still under heavy development, but today, anyone can run a Swarm node.  Going forward, the protocol will also offer incentives in the form of ether (ethereum's native cryptocurrency) for participants in the Swarm network. This aspect is still being fine-tuned.  Additionally, according to Nagy, Swarm encryption has been designed to be ""as smart contract friendly as possible,"" in order to ensure that dapp developers can seamlessly integrate the technology.  That's because while primarily intended to store smart contract information and other blockchain data in a decentralized way, Swarm has other, more far-reaching use cases on the horizon.  For example, the project has secured a number of partnerships over the past year, including video streaming startup Livepeer and Datafund, a privacy-centric data management protocol.  Nagy is also using Swarm to build a censorship-resistant social media platform called BeeFree, working with fellow Ethereum Foundation developer Dimitry Khokhlov. Their goal is to use the technology in a bid to create an alternative to platforms with heavier forms of censorship.
