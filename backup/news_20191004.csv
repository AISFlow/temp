42403310,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfiZr,1570224347,Hacker Returns Ethereum Domains Lost in Bug Exploit,"The domain names stolen from the Ethereum Name Service's (ENS) auction have been returned.  As CoinDesk reported at the time, the ENS bidding process managed by digital-collectibles marketplace OpenSea was exploited, allowing a hacker to nab 17 domain names for lower bids than other users placed. ENS and OpenSea asked the hacker to return the domain names, promising compensation for finding the bug.  An alternative to Web 2.0’s centralized domain name servers (DNS) system, ENS is built on top of the ethereum blockchain to leverage its immutability and decentralized properties. As it happens, immutability isn't always a good thing.  Once the hacker claimed the ENS domain names – which included apple.eth – ENS and OpenSea’s only recourse was to blacklist the domains and ask for the hacker to return them.  Fortunately, they were.    Update: the stolen ENS names were all returned successfully to @ensdomains! 🤗Thanks for supporting the community; we’re working hard to restart bidding this week before #devcon5 and will send out emails to bidders when it’s ready        — OpenSea (@opensea) October 3, 2019      The hacker was apparently swayed by an attractive offer: 25 percent of the final bidding price for each of the returned domains once they are re-auctioned. Some domain names are listed for impressively high bids such as the owner of coffeshop.eth asking for 100 wrapped ether, worth about $17,000 at press time. With 17 domains stolen, the hacker could be in store for a decent payday depending on the auction prices.  OpenSea says auctions will commence again in the coming weeks.  Speaking with CoinDesk, ENS lead developer Nick Johnson said OpenSea had no direct communications with the hacker before the domains were returned. The company solicited feedback in a Sept. 29 blog post disclosing the bug.  ""Evidently the hacker thought 25 percent was a better deal than trying to resell them themselves in the face of blacklisting. Or perhaps they're just generous – either way we're grateful.""

A PayPal spokesperson told CoinDesk in a statement that the payments firm ""made the decision to forgo further participation"" in the Facebook-initiated crypto project, to instead ""continue to focus on advancing our existing mission and business priorities as we strive to democratize access to financial services for underserved populations.""  The statement continued:  ""We remain supportive of Libra’s aspirations and look forward to continued dialogue on ways to work together in the future. Facebook has been a longstanding and valued strategic partner to PayPal, and we will continue to partner with and support Facebook in various capacities.”  ""We can confirm that PayPal has notified us and intends not to join,"" a Libra Association spokesperson told CoinDesk via email.  Facebook unveiled Libra in June, announcing that it would launch a stablecoin meant to bring financial services to unbanked individuals worldwide. The project was met with immediate regulatory backlash, with policymakers in multiple countries claiming that Facebook might run the risk of destabilizing the global monetary order. Ministers from France and Germany promised to block the project, while U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters called on Facebook to halt all development.  The social media giant explained that it would work with 27 launch partners to oversee the governance of the Libra token, using its partner Libra Investment Token as a voting tool. The association is supposed to meet on Oct. 14 to sign a charter formally creating this governing council.  On Friday, the Libra Association's head of policy and communications, Dante Disparte, said in a statement that ""building a modern, low-friction, high-security payment network that can empower billions of financially underserved people is a journey, not a destination. This journey to build a generational payment network like the Libra project is not an easy path.""  Disparte added:  ""We recognize that change is hard, and that each organization that started this journey will have to make its own assessment of risks and rewards of being committed to seeing through the change that Libra promises. We look forward to the first Libra Council meeting in 10 days and will be sharing updates following that, including details of the 1,500 entities that have indicated enthusiastic interest to participate.""

42403307,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfiVv,1570212021,"300cubits, a Blockchain Shipping Pioneer, Gives up on Its TEU Token","300cubits  , an early innovator in using blockchain for international container shipping, has pulled the plug on its TEU token, citing lack of business.  ""The transaction volume through the system have been far from commercial,"" the company wrote in a Sept. 30 statement. ""Only a couple hundred containers have gone through the system, which, although may seems plenty among the shipping blockchain projects, is not sufficient to keep the system going commercially.""  The TEU – a play on Twenty-foot Equivalent Unit, the standard unit of measure in container shipping – was issued in an initial coin offering (ICO) in early 2018 and designated as the medium of exchange for the company's Booking Deposit Module.  Customers, who were given the tokens, would use the TEU to book container space with participating shippers. It was expected that the TEU would have some value and thus solve booking problems that have plagued the container market. Customers would be disinclined to cancel orders, and the shippers would be less likely to overbook their ships.  Trials were conducted in March 2018, and the system went live in July 2018, but interest was limited and few transactions were actually achieved. Sealand – the Florida-based Maersk Group company – Beijing-based Cosco, and Geneva-based MSC tested the TEU, according to the statement, and 300cubits was in discussion with a number of other major shippers.  The company said regulatory issues were a major impediment. Many potential clients backed off given uncertainty as to how the relevant authorities would treat the token. Liquidity and volatility were also said to cause concern among potential customers, while the main selling points of blockchain – immutability and anonymity – did not resonate with or were seen as problems by the market.  300cubits will burn at least 75 percent of the TEU tokens and will continue to burn them as they are returned, according to the statement, and Hong Kong-based company will continue to pursue other blockchain-related opportunities.  Solutions for container booking no-shows, so-called downfalls, have been instituted by the shippers themselves and by the New York Shipping Exchange (NYSHEX), which offers enforceable freight contracts on its platform.  Blockchain is being used in the sector, but in other ways. Most notably, IBM and Maersk are developing TradeLens, a blockchain-based system that allows for the real-time sharing of shipping data between parties connected in a supply chain.

The official line from the U.S. central securities depository (CSD) is that the delay, which has not been previously reported, isto allow for additional testing of the revamped trade information warehouse (TIW).  A spokesperson for the DTCC told CoinDesk:  “The project is progressing well. DLT and cloud development have been completed and we continue to conduct in-depth industry-wide testing with our clients, vendors and technology providers. However, to ensure that this technology is implemented in a measured, prudent and most secure manner, we have allocated additional months for testing, to ensure that firms are 100 percent ready.”  But a person familiar with the technology testing process said the upset about to be caused by the U.K.'s departure from the European Union was also a factor behind the postponement.  The previously scheduled release of the new TIW system coincided with the week of Brexit, which is slated for Oct. 31.  “When Brexit happens, everybody has to open up a whole set of new accounts outside of the U.K. They basically have to kind of split their records; there have to be their E.U. records and their U.K. records,” said the source.  Assuming Brexit does happen, the source added, firms have an additional set of operational work to do and DTCC wanted to separate that from going live with TIW.  There are also other timing issues to do with market implementation, including new regulations from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the source said.  DTCC did not provide an exact date for the re-scheduled release.  The transformation of the TIW from mainframe to cloud, using a distributed ledger designed by technology provider Axoni, is uniquely challenging because when it’s turned on, the legacy system will be switched off.  The TIW handles settlement and processing of $11 trillion of credit derivatives worldwide, making the upgrade, announced in January 2017, one of the most significant enterprise blockchain projects.

Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), Bakkt's parent company, announced the trade Friday but did not disclose its size. A block trade is a large transaction that takes place off the open market in order to avoid moving the price too much.  The trade, which took place Tuesday, comes on the heels of a disappointing launch last week for the much-hyped Bakkt, whose on-exchange volume in its first five trading days totaled just over $5 million.  Two years in the making, Bakkt is the first live market in the U.S. for bitcoin futures that are physically delivered, meaning the buyer receives the underlying commodity.  Despite Bakkt's inauspicious debut, Galaxy Digital and XBTO expressed confidence in the platform.  “As the digital asset class continues to mature, we view the launch of Bakkt as a foundational piece of market infrastructure,” Galaxy Digital said in ICE's press release.  XBTO said in the release that it bought the first bitcoin daily futures last week, in addition to participating in the block trade.  The new bitcoin futures contract has been closely watched by crypto investors, as well as in the broader financial industry, where it's been billed as a product that might attract allocations from institutional money managers, including hedge funds, pension funds and endowments.  Galaxy Digital is led by Mike Novogratz, a former Goldman Sachs executive who later helped run the hedge fund Fortress Investment Group. XBTO's CEO is Philippe Bekhazi, a formerly of Citibank and Steven Cohen's SAC Capital hedge fund.  Friday's press release from Atlanta-based ICE didn't state whether the block trade was made in the exchange's monthly- or daily-settled futures contracts.  In the first two weeks since the start of trading, almost all activity has taken place in the monthly contract, but, even there, activity has disappointed.  Some market analysts have even said that the sluggish uptake contributed to a drop last week in bitcoin prices, since it indicated a lack of demand among institutional investors - with most individual investors currently to gravitate toward the futures contracts started in late 2017 by the rival Chicago-based exchange CME.  In the first four days of this week, just 260 of the Bakkt's monthly futures contracts changed hands, worth about $2.1 million at the closing price of $8,152 per bitcoin on Thursday. While data wasn't available for Friday, the pace of trading is down from last week's volume of 623 contracts, which carried a value of just over $5 million.  On Tuesday, when the block trade crossed, some 27 of the monthly contracts changed hands, for a value of just $226,584 based on that day's closing price. No volume was reported in the daily contract for the day.  Bitcoin prices were little changed in the 24 hours through 17:00 UTC on Tuesday, though were down sharply from over $10,000 prior to the Bakkt contracts' debut on Sept. 19, based on CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.

42403302,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfiR0,1570190442,'Gold-Backed' Crypto Token's Promoter Investigated by Florida Regulators,"The Takeaway  Florida regulators are investigating Karatbars, a German company that’s been promoting a token tied to a Miami “crypto bank” without any banking license in the state.  Karatbars previously issued a cryptocurrency purportedly backed by gold, but CoinDesk has been unable to verify the existence of the mine the company says produced the gold.  Before it entered the crypto space, Karatbars sold gold products online through an affiliate marketing system that regulators in three countries warned the public to avoid.  CoinDesk interviewed three of Karatbars’ current “affiliates,” who said they passionately believe in the company and its tokens.      A German company that claimed to raise $100 million in a 2018 initial coin offering (ICO) is being investigated by Florida financial regulators, CoinDesk has learned.  Karatbars International GmbH has announced plans to follow its first token sale with another one in December 2019. While the 2018 token sale was for its allegedly gold-backed KaratGold Coin (KBC), this year the company has been promoting a KaratBank Coin connected to a “cryptocurrency bank” in Miami.  The claim about a cryptocurrency bank seems to have landed the firm in hot water with the Florida Office of Financial Regulation (OFR).  ""Karatbars is not licensed as a bank with the OFR,” the agency’s director of communications, Katie Norris, told CoinDesk. “The OFR has an open investigation, and so that is all the information I can share at this time.”  Karatbars International GmbH has not responded to CoinDesk’s requests for comment. We will update the article if we hear back.  The Florida investigation is not the first time Karatbars has come under regulatory scrutiny. The company was founded in 2011 by German entrepreneur Harald Seiz, who still heads it.  In 2014, long before Karatbars’ first token sale, Quebec’s Financial Markets Regulator issued a warning for investors to “be cautious” about the company, which offered internet-based purchases of gold to prospective “affiliates.” Karatbars offered these buyers a commission to sign up other affiliates.  Regulators in the Netherlands and Namibia have issued similar public warnings, with the former calling Karatbars’ business a form of multi-level marketing and the latter going so far as to label it a pyramid scheme.  First token  Despite this history, Karatbars' first token, KBC, trades on more than 30 exchanges including HitBTC and Yobit and has been promoted on Twitter by the likes of John McAfee.  The coin, which runs on the ethereum blockchain, was distributed through an ICO in April 2018, reportedly garnering $100 million. Since the summer of 2018, the token has traded at fractions of a penny, according to CoinMarketCap, which calculates KBC’s current global market capitalization at $92,642,798.  The affiliate marketing strategy of Karatbars' earlier business carried over to the token issuance, and affiliates interviewed by CoinDesk said much of their buying activity took place on the company's own platform. Perhaps for this reason, the coins tend to stay put on the public ledger. According to the blockchain data explorer site Etherscan, the first transfer of KBC took place in November 2018, months after the ICO, with 20.9 million tokens now residing in 42 wallets.  Karatbars claims that the gold backing KBC was mined from Fort Dauphin in Madagascar. But CoinDesk was unable to independently verify that such a mine exists, or that Karatbars has any in the country.  In an email forwarded to CoinDesk by a third-party researcher, officials at the Madagascar Chamber of Mines said:  “We regret to inform you that there is no Fort Dauphin gold mine in Madagascar and Karatbars does not hold a mining permit in Madagascar.""  CoinDesk has reached out directly to the relevant authorities in Madagascar and will update the article if we receive more clarity on the matter.  When asked about his posts promoting the company, McAfee told CoinDesk:  ""I believe that coins linked to a standard of value will be the foundation of the entire crypto movement. A safe haven without having to exit the crypto world into the world of fiat currencies.""  ‘I believe in it’  It might be easy to dismiss KBC but many have seen opportunities in the project.  Florida resident Taylor Richey, a long-time gold bug and current KBC affiliate, launched his own startup to facilitate a point-of-sale service for KBC, called Karatstars Labs, after getting laid off from his factory job. So far, Richey said, two merchants (one being his own online store, however) have agreed to accept the tokens as payment for their wares.  “I believe in it enough that I decided to make my own career, a company, building a company to bring value to this ecosystem,” Richey said. “In 2018, when they [Karatbars] pivoted from a gold company into crypto, with the help of their affiliate program they became the number one seller of gold bullion in the world.” (Senior executives at three different organizations in the gold bullion market told CoinDesk it would be difficult or impossible to prove such a claim.)  Three KBC-holders interviewed by CoinDesk stated multiple times that Karatbars ran the world’s largest ICO (a title that arguably belongs to Block.One’s $4.1 billion sale for the EOS blockchain), praised the regulated state of the alleged crypto bank in Miami and mentioned purported endorsements from parties as diverse as the Vatican to the Real Madrid soccer team, neither of which responded to requests for comment. However, famed footballer Roberto Carlos did appear on stage at a Karatbars event in Amsterdam.  Likewise, the holders’ belief in this company, they said, was bolstered by real products – swag and small pieces of gold – that affiliates often received as part of their rewards program. Such affiliated products, like an “upcoming” Karatbars-friendly smartphone, are also promoted on sites like CoinTelegraph and VC News Network, a Reuters partner.  One American KBC affiliate, Andrea LaRosa, broke down in tears while telling CoinDesk about how the gold rewards finally offered her financial freedom in late 2018, after years of struggling with an assortment of bootstrapped businesses. After all, she said, the company has shipped her pieces of real gold.  “It’s based on how many contracts that you can collect. How many transactions that are made, in your business,” LaRosa said. “I’ve been inspired and gotten so much encouragement from other leaders. They don’t want anything from here. They’re really here to help. … I love Dr. Seiz’s mission to help people get out of debt.”  (Affiliates and press materials often refer to Karatbars founder Seiz as a doctor. CoinDesk was not able to independently confirm any such credentials.)  Crypto gateways  Many of these token holders, including LaRosa, came to KBC through the bitcoin community and not through traditional gold bug circles like Richley, who told CoinDesk he did enough research to avoid most ICOs.  LaRosa still holds a little bit of bitcoin and ether herself, although she has moved the majority of her investments into KBC.  “Bitcoin is really backed by nothing. But our KBC is backed by gold, and the [KaratBank Coin] is backed by our assets,” she said of her reasoning. “Eventually the two coins will be merged and come together.”  Likewise, Filipino-American immigrant and KBC affiliate Jose Buco plans to travel back to his homeland in the near future to preach the Karatgold gospel. He told CoinDesk he started by investing $32,000 in this company’s crypto products in 2018, assets which he said public metrics and exchanges now deem to be worth $41,000.  He recently returned from the Netherlands, where hundreds of Karatbars affiliates gathered in August to celebrate their “bridge from the financial system to cryptocurrency,” as Buco put it.  Like the other holders interviewed by CoinDesk, Buco researched Karatbars and bitcoin itself before deciding to prioritize KBC. As someone who felt underserved by the traditional financial system, he said his tangible evidence came from social media and community events, including people he built personal relationships with.  “You can see on YouTube the gold they are stocking up,” Buco said.

42403317,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfiem,1570187713,Bitcoin May Be Headed for a Stronger Price Bounce,"View  Bitcoin’s moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram is charting higher lows, indicating seller exhaustion. Other indicators are also reporting oversold conditions.  A falling channel on the hourly chart may end with a bullish breakout and fuel a rally to $8,800. On the way higher, BTC may encounter resistance at $8,500 (200-day average).  The case for a stronger corrective bounce would weaken if prices find acceptance below $8,000.      Bitcoin’s stalled recovery rally may soon gather pace, as a key indicator is reporting seller exhaustion.  The top cryptocurrency by market value is currently trading at $8,130 on Bitstamp, having faced rejection at highs above $8,500 on Oct. 1.  With the $400 pullback, the corrective bounce from Sept. 30’s lows near $7,700 looks to have ended. Bitcoin’s MACD histogram, however, is telling otherwise.  A technical tool used to identify trend strength and trend changes, the MACD has recovered sharply from the Sept. 26 low of -236 to -56 suggesting weakening bearish momentum.  Daily MACD chart  The MACD has produced shallower bars below the zero line over the last few days. The higher lows indicate seller exhaustion, as noted above, and indicate scope for a stronger corrective bounce.  Daily and hourly charts  The long tails attached to the previous two candles (above left) indicate selling pressure weakened weakened on Wednesday and Thursday, allowing prices to recover lost ground before their UTC closes. Put simply, buyers are beginning to test sellers’ resolve in keeping prices low.  Additionally, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) continues to report oversold conditions with a below-30 print.  All-in-all, the falling channel seen on the hourly chart (above right) appears likely to end with a bullish breakout. That would imply a continuation of the rally from lows near $7,700 and could fuel a rally to $8,833 (June 2 high).  On the way higher, BTC may encounter resistance at the 200-day moving average (MA), currently at $8,503. The average proved a tough nut to crack on Oct. 1.  The bullish case would weaken if prices find acceptance below $8,000 in the next 24 hours, although that looks unlikely. Also, any rally to $8,800 or higher could be short-lived, as longer duration charts are still biased bearish.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

As announced by the company's U.K. arm in a blog post Thursday, British pound (GBP) deposits and transfers are available once again for local Coinbase customers. GBP denominated transactions were paused following the exchange’s July breakup with Barclays.  However, a new partnership with ClearBank, first reported by CoinDesk in August, cleared the way once more for GBP support. The bank is a member of the UK’s near-instantaneous settlement network, the Faster Payment Scheme, which Coinbase required for pound-denominated transactions.  While still banking with ClearBank, Coinbase had to meet several requirements – such as the delisting of privacy coin zcash – before it could utilize the payment network.  To compensate for the lost GBP support, Coinbase reduced trading fees for U.K. customers from Aug. 1–15.  In the blog post, Coinbase also announced the listing of five new cryptocurrencies and tokens for U.K.users, including the XRP, basic attention token (BAT), stellar lumens (XLM), 0x (ZRX) and augur (REP).  The exchange has also just said it will raise fees on its Pro platform for lower volume tiers trading less than $50,000.

On Oct. 7 at 22:00 UTC, Coinbase will usher in higher rates for new tiers of accounts transacting under $10,000, and between $10,000 and $50,000, according to a company blog post on Thursday. The new rates are as follows:  Currently, all accounts trading under $100,000 are charged 0.25 percent (takers) and 0.15 percent (makers).  Volume will continue to be calculated based on accounts' trailing 30 day volume, Coinbase says.

According to comments on Coinbase's blog announcement, the planned fee hike has angered many retail traders, who argue the move is a mistake that could drive clients away in a down period for the crypto markets.  Market commentator and trader Joe McCann tweeted that the very reason Coinbase is raising fees is likely to keep profits rolling in at a time when trading volumes are low.

42382798,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9su2X,1570179793,US House Committee Pressuring Zuckerberg to Testify on Libra: Report,"Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is facing pressure to testify before U.S. lawmakers on the firm's cryptocurrency project Libra.  According to a report from The Information on Friday, Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer of the social media giant, was invited to testify before the U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee on Oct. 29 concerning the new payment network.  However, the body will not finalize the hearing until Zuckerberg also agrees to testify before January 2020, the news source claims.  Libra – a stablecoin backed by a reserve of fiat currencies and government bonds – is slated for launch in the second half of next year, though Zuckerberg recently appeared to cast a little doubt on that timeline in an interview.  Announced in June  , the crypto payments initiative is being developed by an independent non-profit association based in Switzerland.  Sandberg joins David Marcus, Libra co-creator and head of Calibra – the entity building a wallet app for Libra – as the second Facebook representative to sit before the U.S. House committee to face questions on how the cryptocurrency scheme will be structured.  Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), chair of the Financial Services Committee, has been one of the most vocal critics of Facebook’s payment network to date, calling on Facebook to shut down the project until further regulatory review.  Earlier this week, The Verge published leaked audio transcripts from an internal Facebook meeting concerning Libra, among other company issues. In the dialogue, Zuckerberg said Libra continues to meet public scrutiny but is facing less resistance behind closed doors.

42382785,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9stoh,1570176928,Singapore Exchange–Backed iSTOX Raises Series A for Tokenized Securities Trading,"Singapore Exchange-backed security token platform iSTOX raised an undisclosed amount of Series A funding from one of the largest Thai investment banks, Kiatnakin Phatra Financial Group (KKP).  While declining to reveal financial terms of the deal, the firm said KKP is the only investor in the latest funding round.  Proceeds from the raise will be used to grow the user base of qualified investors, issue tokens with a range of securities such as stocks, bonds and structured products, and expand in Asia.  The platform is owned by ICHX Tech, a fintech infrastructure company with blockchain and smart contract technology, that was funded by Singapore Exchange (SGX) and Heliconia Capital Management, a subsidiary of the state-owned investment behemoth Temasek Holdings.  In May, iSTOX was admitted into a fintech regulatory sandbox set up by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the Singaporean central bank. Chew Sutat, EVP of SGX, and Chua Kim Leng, former special advisor of MAS have been appointed as the board members of ICHX Tech.  iSTOX has been onboarding its first batch of issuers and investors to launch the digitized securities trading from the fourth quarter of this year, according to a post from the platform.  “The digitization of securities will certainly be critical in reintermediating the value chain and offering solutions not yet available in conventional capital markets,” chief executive officer Aphinant Klewpatinond said in a statement.  iSTOX can open a door to the private capital markets that is otherwise unavailable for the vast majority of investors, chief strategy officer Darius Liu told CoinDesk.  “Many investors these days are not getting the returns they want from the major public financial markets and are very interested in private market opportunities such as equity in series B start-ups, corporate debt, and hedge funds,” Liu explained.  The market for such securities is “extremely fragmented and opaque” requiring high transaction fees from the middlemen and long settlement times, Liu said, noting only ultra-high net worth individuals and the very well-connected can effectively compete.  The firm touts that the new platform ensures all users have equal access and information about opportunities, eliminates many of the high costs, and effectively opens private investment to accredited and institutional investors.  “By offering issuance, custody, and secondary market trading on one platform, iSTOX provides a one-stop shop for investors,” Liu said. “This is important because if you lack any one of these, it costs you time and adds cost and complexity.”  iSTOX has hired three law firms to advise issuers on the structure and issuance process for such securities, including Allen & Gledhill LLP, Baker McKenzie Wong & Leow and Rajah & Tann.

In an interview with Les Echos newspaper, Cook argued that private companies shouldn't be competing with states on monetary control, stating:  ""No. I deeply believe that money must remain in the hands of states. I am not comfortable with the idea that a private group creates a competing currency. A private company does not have to seek to gain power in this way.""  The comment may be a dig at Facebook, which is developing a stablecoin payments project called Libra – slated for a 2020 launch – that has been under fire from regulators worldwide over its potential risk to financial stability and national monetary policies.  Lawmakers in the U.S. and the EU have called for the project to be halted.  Cook further stressed that the control of money should lie with elected governments, saying:  ""Money, like Defense, must remain in the hands of States, it is at the heart of their mission. We elect our representatives to assume government responsibilities. Companies are not elected, they do not have to go on this ground.  Rather than go down the crypto path, Apple has been putting its efforts into building its fiat-currency payments initiatives with both Apple Pay and Apple Card aimed to make payments work smoothly across its famous devices.  Cook's comments take a different direction from Apple Pay vice president Jennifer Bailey, who said last month that the firm is ""watching cryptocurrency,"" and adding: “We think it's interesting. We think it has interesting long-term potential.”  The firm has, however, been quietly working behind the scenes on blockchain projects.  In February, the Cupertino, California-based firm submitted a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that mentioned Apple’s involvement in the drafting of “Blockchain Guidelines” for the Responsible Business Alliance’s Responsible Minerals Initiative.
