42379457,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX882uR,1494669645,Bitcoin's Scaling Debate: The View From China's Miners,"Paul Elliot-Ennis is a lecturer and assistant professor in management information systems in the College of Business, University College Dublin, while Rachel-Rose O'Leary is an artist and writer researching cryptographic systems.  In this guest feature, Elliot-Ennis and O'Leary investigates the daily activities and political attitudes of China's well-established bitcoin mining sector, positioning his findings within the context of the network's scaling debate.  At present, the bitcoin community is engaged in a voracious debate about how best to scale the network. But in such a context, it's sometimes all too easy to overlook the human figures involved in that debate.  Positioned on one side are the Bitcoin Core developers, (a term many wish to avoid reifying) but who nonetheless are recognizable as a cadre of sorts. On the other side of the debate, underrepresented and frequently misunderstood, are the China-based mining pools and hardware providers.  We reached out to three mining pools – AntPool, Bixin and BW – to get a varied perspective on how they feel about Western attitudes toward them, but also how the day-to-day operations of mining occur.  Bitcoin culture can, at times, be argumentative, and this is at least partially attributable to the communication gap between China and the English speaking world. Virgilio Lizardo Jr, head of international for Bitbank Group (owners of BW pool), describes the language barrier between China and the English-speaking world as ""immense"", leading to a dialogue blighted by miscommunication.  One significant effect of this divide, Virgilio emphasized, is that due to the lack of Chinese presence on English-speaking bitcoin forums, stereotypes of Chinese miners continue to proliferate.  The sentiment is echoed by perhaps the most well-known Chinese miner of them all, Jihan Wu, co-founder of Bitmain, the operator of AntPool.  He told CoinDesk:  ""A lack of a common discussion field has allowed for the creation of an echo-chamber in the technical community outside China, where the voice and interests of the Chinese miners are misunderstood and not represented.""  Nature of the problem  Lizardo, a transposed Westerner with a strong sense of Chinese culture, noted that one overlooked issue is that the miners have no obvious media outlet to get their position across, leading to distorted narratives and the compounding of mistrust.  He further emphasized that there is a tendency to group the Chinese miners together as a single ""monolithic entity"".  However, their visions for the future are predictably diverse. While Wu is an open supporter of Bitcoin Unlimited, positions toward the scaling debate vary enormously across the miners.  Asked for his opinion, Tyler Xiong of Bixin, formerly HaoBTC, argued the importance of maintaining a single implementation of the protocol and a healthy community, stating: ""We don't want the breakup of bitcoin"".  This is contrary to Wu, who commented:  ""I believe multiple implementations are healthy for the bitcoin ecosystem.""  Business priorities  Wu also stressed that it is important to recognize that the mining operations in China and elsewhere are businesses, each with their own agenda and strategies.  According to Wu, while there is a general consensus among miners that bigger blocks are needed, ""most miners prefer to stay away from the discussion"" and focus on the daily operation of their businesses.  As is well-known, information about the actual, day-to-day mining operations in China are hard to come by. Occasionally, we will get photographs or videos of vast-industrial warehouses packed with whirring mining machines, but not much more.  Often situated in the depths of the Chinese countryside they are, admittedly, aesthetically powerful: equal parts industrial traditionalism and science fiction. Most of the miners confirmed what many have long-known about why China cornered the mining market – cheap electricity.  Wu, arguably the most successful mine operator in the history of bitcoin, said the most challenging part of planning a new mining farm is finding access to a low-cost and reliable electricity supply. Lizardo also reported that while constructing a mine is not difficult the ""logistics of transporting thousands of miners is challenging.""  Tyler painted a picture of what occurs once construction is complete:  ""The daily job includes 1) the installing, maintenance and repairing of miners and other facilities, and 2) monitoring the temperature in different areas of the mining farm. It requires a lot of passion because there are tens of thousands of miner at the same time and you want all of them are available 24/7.""  Important function  At BW pool, most of the labour is drawn from local communities, trained by the company to become technicians and maintenance workers. Each miner we spoke to stressed that looking after the mines was a 24-hour job, requiring constant supervision by employees.  Jihan highlighted this same phenomenon, stating:  ""You need to human resource to constantly look after the farm, you need to maintain constant and direct communication with the investors of your farm, you need to maintain the mining equipment.""  The take home across all the interviews was that mining was, at heart, a difficult, costly and time-consuming job.  Further, that perhaps in the fog of endless debates we have lost sight of the important function Chinese miners have for bitcoin’s maintenance and security.

42379460,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX882zT,1494667512,$600k for an Ethereum Name? A Thriving Auction Market Is Underway,"After a shaky start this spring, a project called the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) appears to be attracting serious capital.  Thousands of people are vying for a new set of ethereum names being auctioned off by the leaderless domain service, with some putting in bids for upwards of $1m.  Even though bid amounts are more like deposits (which you can get back after a year, if you chose to relinquish the name), what still comes as a surprise is how much people are willing to put toward more popular names.  So far, exchange.eth was claimed for 6,660 ETH ($609,000), foundation.eth went for 300 ETH ($27,000), and weather.eth was auctioned for 101 ETH ($9,000).  In case you missed our launch coverage, ENS works similar to the domain name server (DNS) system we know today, creating human-readable names to use in place of machine names. But instead of pointing to websites on the internet, ethereum names point to ethereum resources, like wallets, content on its decentralized storage system Swarm, and more. Also, ENS itself is decentralized, running on smart contracts.  On the first day of the relaunch, auctions began opening up at a trickle, but that pace quickly accelerated as the week wore on. At press time, 27,800 auctions have been initiated, with thousands more opening each day.  More unusual names included ones like ethereumclassic.eth, winklevoss.eth and donaltrump.eth.  Secret bids  So, you may be wondering how the bidding works.  When you open an auction, you enter a single bid for the most you are willing to pay for a name. But, you only pay up to the amount of the second highest bidder, or if nobody bids against you, you only pay the minimum of 0.01 ether.  Note, that you only get one chance to bid on a name. Further, all bids are sealed, so anyone who bids against you does so blindly. They put in a bid for the most they are willing to pay, and whomever comes out on top, wins.  Because there is no central trusted service to hold on to the bids – smart contracts cannot hold secrets – users have to reveal their bids themselves. (Nick Johnson, one of the Ethereum Foundation employees leading the project, recommends people set a calendar date, and then reveal a name right away, so they don't forget and lose their bid.)  Bumps in the road  Still there were some minor bumps in the first week of the ENS launch, including a couple of bugs Johnson called ""low impact"".  For instance, one bug caused users to bid on the wrong version of a domain when they entered a name with mixed capital letters. But that was remedied, and the program now automatically lowers the case.  Also, Johnson explained, a few people lost the opportunity to reveal their bids because, after they bid, they reset their browsers (clearing the data) before backing up their data to a JSON file first.  You have a 48-hour window to reveal bids manually after the three-day bidding period, otherwise, any ether you put up are burnt. Now, the system prompts you immediately to download your bids, so people do have a reminder.  Wallet support  Further, since the launch, third parties have stepped into the game, giving users more options for how to manage their auctions.  Initially, if you wanted to bid on an ethereum name, your only choice was to use the official dapp, which requires a blockchain-enabled browser, or the command line. But now you can also go to MyEtherWallet.com, which will step you through the process. Ethtools.com has integrated with ENS, as well.  However, Johnson says, just like most users on the internet don't buy their own domain names, it's likely most ENS users won't go through the process of buying their own ethereum names either. Instead, he believes users will go to their favorite wallet, and the wallet will instantly give them a name, like alice.myetherwallet.eth, which they can use.  Johnson told CoinDesk:  ""I think we’ll see the real take off for usage once the wallets start giving their own domain names and they can set up that system. Then anyone can claim their own payments address instantly. And suddenly, it will be possible for anyone to have a name without going through the whole auction process.""  What's next?  As the ENS team moves forward, the plan is to focus on getting more wallets to integrate and support the software. Johnson said he also wants to expand the capabilities of ENS and add more standardized components.  ""One of the things we would like to do is add proper support for DNS records. We could then use one of the alternate DNS hierarchies to offer .eth as a top level domain,"" he said. ""You could actually host your website with a .eth domain, though not on the global internet for now, because we have to talk to ICANN about all of that.""  Right now, ENS is releasing names over an eight-week period as part of its slow launch. And in two years, a planned upgrade will move ENS to a more permanent system, at which point, people will be able to auction for shorter names less than seven characters.
