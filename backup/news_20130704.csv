42422952,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy1yurh,1372964426,Physical bitcoin producer Bitbill applies for cold storage patent,"The creator of Bitbill, Douglas Feigelson, has filed a patent application entitled ""Creating and using digital currency"", and covers a general method of storing digital currency in a physical token. While the term is not used in the patent application, it is directly aimed at a generic method of so-called cold storage of cryptocurrency, of which Bitbill is not the only method.  The application, filed under 20130166455, states:  Among other things, a physical device carries value and can be physically delivered in a transaction. The physical device includes a representation of the value carried by the physical device. The representation is usable to transfer the value from the physical device to a digital domain. A security feature can change from a state indicating that the value carried by the physical device has not been compromised to a state indicating that the value carried by the physical device may have been compromised. The change in state is detectable, the representation of the value carried by the physical device being inaccessible except in a manner that causes the security feature to change state.  That is a fairly general description, and part of the patent references Bitbill as just an example application of the technology. Furthermore, Feigelson makes the statement, ""Bitbills are the first and only Bitcoins in physical form"".  Leaving aside the debate over who was first and what technologies are being used, Bitbill is not the only physical form of bitcoin as there are Casascius coins, Bitcoin paper wallets, and Firmcoin (currently at the prototype stage).  Let's Talk Bitcoin reports  an instant message exchange between the Casascius coin creator, Mike Caldwell and one of the Bitbill co-founders, in which the Bitbill co-founder clearly states that they believe Casascius coins use Bitbill technology. However, the spokesperson would not be drawn on how the situation was to be dealt with.  While this patent may have been taken as a defensive measure, there has been no word from Bitbill to set minds at rest that litigation will not follow. In turn, the broad nature of the patent could have a potential chilling effect on the bitcoin ecosystem.  Finally, the patent has not been granted yet. There are suggestions that prior art exists which may yet invalidate the patent.

42397180,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAacMEf,1372953534,Bulls and bears: Why is the price of bitcoin falling?,"UPDATED: 21:34 (BST) July 5, 2013    The price of bitcoin has taken a tumble since this article was first published.      As predicted by many, the value increased after Mt. Gox announced USD withdrawals had resumed, but it has since decreased to, at the time of writing, $68.75.      I spoke to a bitcoin investor, who didn't want to be named, and here's what he had to say:      ""I have no explanation other than people are scared. They have seen it drop from $30 to $3 before and might be worried that it will again.      ""Bitcoin tends to have huge swings, both up and down. For me, this is a huge buying opportunity. My faith in the long-term potential is as high as ever. But who knows. It might go to $30 before it goes back.""    -----------------------------------------------------  The price of bitcoin has increased slightly since Mt. Gox announced withdrawals had resumed, however, it's still way off the highs of around $260 reached in early April or even the $135 reached in May.  But what’s behind the decline witnessed over the past six weeks? The prevailing view seems to be … a combination of factors. Let's take a look at what some of those involved in the space think.  Alistair Cotton, corporate dealer at Currencies Direct, said he thinks the recent fall in the price of bitcoin is due to the digital currency becoming more mainstream and, therefore, ""coming further into the gaze of regulators"".  It's widely believed that the recent involvement of regulators, especially in the US, has made some investors rather jittery and led to an increase of sellers, causing the price of bitcoin to fall.  Mr Cotton thinks digital currency will eventually need to be regulated for it to have a long-term future, but he admitted many bitcoiners would disagree. He said:  ""The biggest fear for bitcoin investors would be regulators banning or attempting to restrict its use and, since the currency’s value is essentially tied to how widely accepted it is, its price will react significantly any time bitcoin and regulation are mentioned in the same sentence.""  The media  Bitcoin entrepreneur and investor Jérémie Dubois-Lacoste believes the media is partly to blame for the price decrease. He claims it was media hype that caused droves of people to invest in February and March, when prices were around $30.  ""Many of them did not dig into the fundamentals of bitcoin. They were hooked-up by a plethora of mainstream media articles and were barely interested in short-term financial profit.  ""These people might have lost confidence, but, for me, their confidence was never really placed in bitcoin success in the first place, and the lack of bitcoin-related articles in mainstream media after those two months just drove them to sell,"" he explained.  Others point the finger at the increase in negative bitcoin stories that focus on the darker side of the currency – for example its use in the purchase of drugs and pornography. Some of those wishing not to be associated with either of these things have decided to sell up and move away from the bitcoin table.  The Eurozone  One commonly-cited explanation for the price of bitcoin rocketing earlier in the year was the crisis in Cyprus, which caused people to lose faith in their central currencies and turn, instead, to bitcoin.  The Eurozone crisis is far from over, but faith seems to have been (marginally) restored in fiat, which could explain a loss of interest in bitcoin. Dubois-Lacoste expects the European economy to take another dive in the not-so-distant future, though. He said:  ""The economy does nothing but get worse. If Portugal goes through a similar situation as the one we saw in Cyprus, the consequence for bitcoin could be tremendous because of the country's size, not to mention what could happen in Spain.""  With the uncertain future of the euro, bitcoin might still have the opportunity to increase its stance as a trusted currency in Europe.  Mt. Gox  A young currency like bitcoin depends largely on trust. If people don't trust the currency, they won't want to use it, which causes its value to fall.  Bitcoin trader and internet entrepreneur Markus Menno Jong said the recent problems experienced by Mt. Gox could be responsible for a number of people's loss of trust in bitcoin.  ""The fact that US dollar withdrawals from Mt. Gox were not possible and that there is a lot of uncertainty in the market about the future of exchanges like Mt. Gox, due to interference by regulators, is part of the reason why the price of bitcoin has decreased,"" he said.  Not only did Mt. Gox recently put a hold on US dollar withdrawals for two weeks, it also suffered downtime issues caused by a system error. Add to this its registration with FinCEN as a money services business and what was once viewed as the biggest player in the bitcoin world is now being lambasted for being the greatest confidence killer in the space.  The domino effect  Vladimir Marchenko, CTO of BTC Global, suggested that although Mt. Gox is partially to blame for the decreasing price of bitcoin, the main wedge of responsibility lies at the door of an entirely different beast: the domino effect of fear. He said:  ""Bearish price action has been further emphasised by panicking speculators and probably by some panicking 'early adopters' who do not have the stomach to look at current price and see their '$250-plus-per-coin bitcoin fortunes' weathering away.""  This is a sentiment supported by Michael Parsons of BitcoinByte.com: ""Buyers are afraid of a further drop in prices so want to 'cash out' some or all of their profits before the price falls further. As more sellers cash out, and with not enough willing buyers, the price drops. It's almost a self-fulfilling prophecy.""  A ray of hope  The price of bitcoin may not be as impressive as it once was, but speaking to a number of people involved in the space, it seems they are largely confident the currency will recover and then go from strength to strength. It's difficult to tell, though, whether this is merely biased foresight of those involved in the ecosystem.  I'll leave you with a particularly optimistic outlook from Marchenko of BTC Global: ""I believe that bitcoin is grossly undervalued. I also believe that we have rapidly improving fundamentals and continuing growth of the bitcoin ecosystem.  ""I expect the price to hit four-digit numbers by the end of 2013 or in 2014, with further exponential growth continuing in coming years. This is great time for large players with long time investment horizons to enter the market.""

42397186,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAacMLY,1372942468,Micropayment tipping system Flattr adds bitcoin support,"Flattr, the micropayment tipping system, has just announced that it will now allow users to fund their account with bitcoin. The service, which was created by one of the founders of the Pirate Bay, has the goal of providing an easy way for content creators to gain tip-like payment from the public.  We spoke to Flattr's Linus Olsson about its relationship to bitcoin.  Q. For anyone who hasn't heard of Flattr, would you give a layperson's explanation of your service?  It's a one-click microdonation system system for free content. It's the easiest way to support creators by giving microdonations when you ""Like"", ""Favorite"" & ""Star"" content directly on services like YouTube, Instagram and Soundcloud. All microdonations comes from one budget so you can support all the creators you want without thinking about the cost. The monthly budget you choose is divided by the number of flattrs you make.  As an example of Olsson's description, when you find some content worthy of payment, you ""flattr"" it. At the end of the month, your monthly contribution is equally split between all of the content creators you flattr'd. For example, if I pay £10 per month, and flattr ten people in June, each will get £1 each. If I had only flattr'd two people, they would get £5 each.  Q. Do you feel there is a philosophical compatibility between Flattr and cryptocurrencies?  Yes, we think creators should be able to make money without going through established media houses with terrible contracts. The same way supporters should be able to support their favourite creators. Bitcoins fits great into that philosophy.  Q. What has stopped you using bitcoin so far?  We did not find the right bitcoin processor, but now we have. And now users can fund their account with bitcoins!  Q. Have you considered any of the altcurrencies?  No, not yet.  Q. Do you think that Bitcoinj's implementation of the off-blockchain micropayment system as described here could help Flattr?  I'm not a developer so I could not say really.  Content creators can provide payment points to Flattr users by adding Twitter-like widgets or QR codes to their website. Alternatively, the Flattr mobile app can present, and scan QR codes for users to Flattr each other.  Users will have to opt-in to bitcoin payments by selecting bitcoin on the ""Add funds"" page. As mentioned, though, there is yet no option to withdraw funds in BTC, but Flattr has asked user for feedback on this point.  When asked why BIPS had been a suitable bitcoin payment partner, Flattr responded by saying that the process was easy and they were responsive.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC,David Gilson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/07/04/micropayment-tipping-system-flattr-adds-bitcoin-support,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3a6952a9069ca8618a616f4cc33dfd84588589b9-480x215.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397177,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAacMAj,1372934077,Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox resumes US dollar withdrawals after two-week hiatus,"Global US dollar withdrawals have fully resumed at Mt. Gox following a two-week testing period of its new transaction processing system.  The exchange said it still managed to process over $1 million worth of withdrawals over the past fortnight, despite having announced a temporary hiatus.  ""As this required a great deal of manpower and was not a perfect solution, we are quite happy with the progress made despite the conditions,"" reads the statement from Mt. Gox.  The company also used the statement to announce it has formed relationships with a number of new banking partners across the world, which it claims will create ""increased stability"".  There is still a backlog of withdrawals that Mt. Gox has to process and it is increasing transaction speeds to get through these as quickly as possible, but the company expects this to take around two weeks.  ""Despite the hiccups, these are exciting times and we are eternally grateful for your confidence and support along this bumpy road,"" the statement concludes.  The value of bitcoin has steadily decreased over recent weeks, with a drop from around $89 last week to $78 today, but the question is, what effect will the resumption of US dollar withdrawals at Mt. Gox have on prices?  Bitcoin trader and internet entrepreneur Markus Menno Jong predicts the news will lead to a short-term increase in the price of bitcoin, up to just over $80. However, he believes this will be short-lived, with the price falling once again within a couple of days.  ""I don't think there is just one magic reason why the price of bitcoin is going down, but multiple reasons. The market for bitcoin is very emotional/sentimental – one article or comment on a blog or Facebook page can make the price go up or down by as much as five or 10 percent,"" he added.  Jong believes the ""hype"" is over for this year and the price will fall to the $50 region later in 2013. ""Next year, however, bitcoin prices may continue to rise to record levels.""  Vladimir Marchenko, CTO at BTC Global, said it's impossible to tell what effect Mt. Gox's announcement will have on the price of bitcoin.  ""Mt. Gox resuming withdrawals can, on one hand, result in funds trapped in Mt. Gox to finally find a way out of it to competing exchanges. On the other hand, it could cause increased confidence in bitcoin infrastructure and actually more funds being deposited to Mt. Gox than being withdrawn and, therefore, precipitate bullish price action,"" he said.  Marchenko went on to say Mt. Gox is losing its stranglehold on the bitcoin exchange market. ""If this trend continues, it is likely that before long Mt. Gox will cease being a price setting exchange.""  Mt. Gox recently registered with the US Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) as a money transmitter, a sign that it is willing to comply with US regulation in order to continue operating. There is a long road ahead, however, as it must now register with the individual states, which is a much more costly and time-consuming process.  The bitcoin exchange has also suffered technical downtime issues lately and a general lowering of user confidence within the bitcoin ecosystem.  What effect do you think Mt. Gox's announcement will have on the price of bitcoin?
