42375304,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw79o7,1644796200,First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Inches Upward in Sunday Trading,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Market moves: Bitcoin rose slightly on Sunday but was still way off its price of a week ago; most major altcoins dipped over the weekend.  Technician's take: BTC was confined to a tight range over the weekend. Indicators are neutral, although oversold conditions could keep short-term buyers active.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Can You Trust the Celebrity Crypto Endorsements at the Super Bowl This Year? MATIC Token Surges as Polygon Raises $450M to Support Web 3 Plans  ""First Mover"" hosts spoke with CoinDesk columnist David Morris for his views on crypto firms such as FTX and Crypto.com becoming major advertising players at this year's U.S. football championship game, the Super Bowl. Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal shared details behind the firm's latest raise that allow it to build Web 3 applications and invest in zero-knowledge technology. Plus, Kareem Sadek of KPMG Canada spoke about the firm's decision to add crypto to its balance sheet.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $42,176 +0.1%  Ether (ETH): $2,879 -0.7%  Top Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Ethereum Classic ETC +3.8% Smart Contract Platform Dogecoin DOGE +3.1% Currency Bitcoin Cash BCH +1.9% Currency  Top Losers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Stellar XLM −2.6% Smart Contract Platform Solana SOL −2.4% Smart Contract Platform Cosmos ATOM −2.0% Smart Contract Platform  Markets  S&P 500: 4,418 -1.9%  DJIA: 34,738 -1.4%  Nasdaq: 13,791 -2.7%  Gold: $1,858 +1.7%  Market moves  Bitcoin inched upward on Sunday but remained well off where it started the week amid investors' concerns about ongoing inflationary pressure and a possible war with Russia.  At the time of publication, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was trading at about $42,200, up slightly over the past 24 hours. Ether and other major altcoins fell. Ether was trading at about $2,880, off slightly.  ""Overall, crypto is down this week, including a slide in prices Friday that some believe is correlated to reports of Russian military exercises indicating that an invasion and possible resulting war is imminent,"" said Joe DiPasquale, the CEO of fund manager BitBull Capital.  Trading volume for the past week was about half its level of a year ago, leading to the high price volatility. ""This week has seen the prices of major cryptos both rise and fall sharply,"" DiPasquale said.  Crypto's choppy performance has largely emulated major stock indexes, which fell sharply on Friday. The S&P 500 dropped nearly 2% on Friday and the tech-focused Nasdaq plummeted 2.7%.  To be sure, bitcoin and ether are up in February after a lackluster first month of the year, although solana and other altcoins are down ""due to jitters over insecurities in the Wormhole protocol,"" DiPasquale noted.  He added that ""anything can happen"" if bitcoin approaches $40,000 because of the lower trading volumes. ""If the support. line holds, we could see a large bounce, but it does not we could see a significant drop,"" he said.  Technician's take  Bitcoin Drops Below $43K; Support at $35K-$40K  Bitcoin (BTC) sellers were active after buyers failed to sustain a break above $45,000 this week. The cryptocurrency was roughly flat over the past 24 hours and was confined to a tight range over the weekend. Initial support at $40,000 could stabilize pullbacks.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart approached oversold territory on Wednesday, which preceded the recent downturn in price. On the weekly chart, however, the RSI is rising from oversold levels similar to what occurred in March 2020, which could keep buyers active over the short term.  Momentum indicators improved on the weekly chart after BTC rose 4% over the past seven days. That suggests a neutral outlook so long as support holds above $35,000-$40,000 over the weekend.  Still, the monthly chart appears bearish similar to July 2018, which was the middle of a crypto bear market.  Important events  New Zealand REINZ house price index (Jan.

42394301,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvbQiH,1644777642,Soccer Fans Need Better Than NFTs,"After the best part of two years away from live soccer matches, football fans deserve better (by football, I mean the older, actual kind.)  Instead, fans are being offered non-fungible tokens (NFT). The English Premier League, the most popular league in the world, has 20 different clubs; 17 of these clubs have signed deals with “fan token” firms (like Socios, for example). Under such deals, according to The Daily Mail U.K., “clubs now sell digital, tradable club-specific tokens that allow the holders to vote on minor club matters such as the color of the manager's scarf.” Yes, the color of the manager's scarf. A matter that occupies the minds of very few, if any, actual football fans. A spokesperson for the Football Supporters Association told the Mail that crypto-based “fan token partnerships are either trying to monetize trivial matters that could easily be solved with online polls of season ticket holders, or inserting financial barriers into genuine supporter engagement.” “Neither,” he believes, “is a good look.” Is he right?  First off, for the uninitiated, NFTs are “non-fungible tokens.” Each “token” represents a digital certificate of authenticity. These digital certificates verify ownership ( a slippery term that we will come to in a bit) of an asset. The tokens, meanwhile, are stored on a digital ledger called a blockchain, meaning records of ownership can't be forged. NFTs are closely tied to cryptocurrencies.  To say that the world of NFTs is a niche one is to understate how much NFTs actually mean to the average individual. Of course, this is not to say that NFTs don’t have the potential to change the digital landscape. They might. In this time of viruses, social distancing, new strains and general anxiety, there is high demand for digital ticketing. Or, to be more exact, contactless ticketing, which significantly reduces the risk of individuals getting sick (no more passing documents between staff and concert goers, football fans, etc.). In March of last year, Burnley FC, a club situated in North West England, partnered with YellowHeart, a made-in-NYC, NFT live event ticketing platform. The introduction of ticket sales through NFTs was the first example of a Premiership football club using blockchain technology to offer alternative ticketing options.  Read more: Jeff Wilser - In Europe, Football NFTs and Tokens Are No Fantasy  Although NFTs may very well be the future of contactless ticketing, those in the know are preparing themselves for a cataclysmic market crash. Contactless ticketing is perfectly possible without NFTs. Football fans deserve better; they deserve something tangible. Sadly, NFTs appear to be just a play thing for the already well off. A luxury that many cash-strapped football fans can ill-afford to engage in.  A number of English clubs and football stars are busy promoting Ape Kids Club, “a magical world” where apes, we’re told, rule the metaverse, a mysterious place I have discussed elsewhere. These “cute baby apes” are offshoots of the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs. You know, the things people like Eminem, Logan Paul and Jimmy Fallon have spent hundreds of thousands on. In the U.K., John Terry and Ashley Cole, two ex-Chelsea players, have promoted the “baby apes,” as has Reece James, Chelsea’s current left back. These athletes are prepared to spend thousands of pounds on highly controversial cartoon monkeys. Now, it seems, they want fans to do the same. Should they? Ultimately, that's up to the fans.  The corporatization of football is real, and it’s alienating the fans, the lifeblood of any respectable football club.  Last year, to celebrate winning the league, Manchester City launched the “1” collection, a series of commemorative digital artworks that were available for purchase as NFTs. This was the first ever time a Premier League winning club had dropped an NFT to celebrate a title win. While some lauded the club’s attempts to digitally engage the fans, others were quick to bemoan the fact that Manchester City charge the highest ticket prices in the league. Perhaps a better form of fan engagement would involve lower ticket prices, especially for kids. West Ham, a London-based club, also offers fans the chance to purchase NFTs. Last year, renowned artists Canning Town Len created 50 animated portraits of West Ham United players – past and present. The NFTs were auctioned on OpenSea, the peer-to-peer marketplace for NFTs, rare digital items and crypto collectibles. The creation of these collectibles came shortly after the price of regular adult season tickets rose “by more than four times the current rate of inflation,” according to KUMB.com. The biggest increase, we’re told, was reserved for under-16 season tickets. Again, most fans want easier access to games, including more affordable ticket prices.  Of course, among football fans, there is some demand for NFTs. However, before purchasing one, fans should familiarize themselves with the risks involved, because buying an NFT is not without a considerable degree of risk. In this brave new world, where the wild wild west meets digitally distributed, decentralized networks, rules don’t really exist. Purchasing “baby ape,” for example, doesn’t entitle you to the copyright of the work. As the world of NFTs is very much in its infancy, issues such as piracy and other forms of intellectual property violations are quite common.  And what happens if a buyer gets hacked and the NFT gets stolen? What protection is there for the football fan who gets scammed? What protection is there for the parent who purchases their child a “baby ape”? None.  In the words of Nathan J. Robinson, “You can’t call the police and have them prevent someone from copying or using your NFT. Is the right to have your name listed as the “owner” of an easily reproduced digital thing, without that listing conferring any rights on you, worth paying money for? What do the people who buy these things think they are getting?” Although Robinson is a notorious crypto skeptic, a man who sees the glass as completely empty, these are fair questions to ask.  The so-called beautiful game is fast becoming an ugly one. Football, supposedly the sport of the working class, appears to have lost its soul. As The Atlantic recently reported, when the aforementioned “fan token” platform Socios collaborated with Crystal Palace F.C., a London-based Premier league club, “Fans showed up to a game with a banner reading, MORALLY BANKRUPT PARASITES SOCIOS NOT WELCOME.” The corporatization of football is real and it’s alienating the fans, the lifeblood of any respectable football club. A ""let them eat cake"" mentality now reigns supreme. What the average fan needs is something a little more substantial than pixelated apes and esoteric identification codes. In short, they need more than literal token gestures.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | WALLET,John Mac Ghlionn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/02/13/soccer-fans-need-better-than-nfts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/65c133e1f65104f6f964ffc97d1f848f1fb8a305-4825x3216.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42410932,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggtSlS,1644767400,"You’re Not Imagining It, Markets Really Are Thinner Now","If it somehow feels as if cryptocurrency markets are relatively quiet, that’s because they are. That is, trading volumes as a percentage of market cap in many of the major cryptocurrencies are lower compared with previous months. The end result is that it may take smaller amounts of capital to move the markets wildly.  Just a year ago — Feb. 13, 2021 — bitcoin was trading at around $47,000. The day’s trading volume on centralized and decentralized exchanges taken together was nearly $62 billion and the market cap was just shy of $840 billion, according to data from CoinGecko. Thus, volume was about 8% of market cap.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Sunday.  On Wednesday, Feb. 9, 2022, bitcoin changed hands at $44,000, putting market cap at $837 billion. Yet volume was just $29 billion, or 3% of value.  That the market cap now is just about the same as a year ago drives home the point that the relative volume drop isn’t necessarily a function of price. The two examples given are representative rather than aberrations; for the month of February 2021, daily bitcoin volumes averaged around 8% of market cap, and over the past 30 days, it’s been 3%.  The drop-off for ether is even more dramatic. A year ago, the ratio of volume to value averaged 20% every day in February. Now it’s 4%.  Fine, those are the big two in crypto, but surely the same hasn’t happened elsewhere, you may say. However, you’d be wrong.  Layer 1s may be the talk of the town these days, but trading volumes on exchanges haven’t kept up with skyrocketing market caps. A year ago, February daily volumes versus value in BNB, cardano, solana and avalanche averaged 22%, 25%, 9% and 17%, respectively. Over the past 30 days, it’s been 2%, 5%, 6% and 4%.  As this data includes decentralized exchanges, the drop can’t be attributed all that much to the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi). Besides, decentralized exchange volumes in February 2021 were above $60 billion, according to data from Dune Analytics and published on DeFiPrime.com. That works out to a little more than $2 billion per day. In January, the total was $100 billion or north of $3 billion per day.  Yet ether, still the most important currency in decentralized finance, saw average daily volumes over the past month of $15.6 billion, but that’s down from $38 billion a year ago.  Speaking of DeFi, ratios in that sector also took a tumble, failing to keep pace with exploding values. Uniswap, which has the lion’s share of DeFi transactions and market cap for its token, was worth $6.8 billion a year ago and saw its token change hands to the tune of $1.5 billion daily. Now its market cap is $5.6 billion, and volumes on the uniswap token average just $223 million. Aave and cakeswap have suffered similar fates, albeit using smaller values.  Thinner markets, of course, mean that it doesn’t take as much to move prices as it once did. For an example, look no further than a week ago, Saturday, Feb. 5, when bitcoin finally broke above $40,000 and stayed there for the first time in over a week. Volumes the previous day were $16 billion, and on Saturday they were $25 billion. Again, these figures are low even by recent standards, but they serve as a reminder that it doesn’t take much to move a market.  That may be something to think about should we see large institutional entrants anytime soon.",NEUTRAL,없음,ADA | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | UNI,Lawrence Lewitinn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/02/13/youre-not-imagining-it-markets-really-are-thinner-now,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/91100dee8fd594ab775f33b8b69faf74df83b016-8192x5461.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It is currently valued at $42,398.83 as of Sunday. On Saturday, the BTC/USD exchange rate increased by 7.07%. Bitcoin ended the day at $42 414, up 3.54% from Wednesday&apos;s low. According to analysts, investors are in profit taking mode this week, rapidly eroding daily gains and capping the market at around the 45K level. Bitcoin fell to an intraday low of $43,917.4 Saturday morning before recovering. Late in the day, a new high of $48,598 was set, surpassing the previous high of $43,284 set earlier in the day. Despite concerns about the global economy and rising inflation, investors are attracted to Bitcoin&apos;s (BTC) price movement. Quick Bitcoin Price Analysis Bitcoin would have to avoid a break below the pivot level of $45,841 in order to activate the first major resistance level at $48,765. The crypto would require broad market support to break out of this new swing high of $48,945. Unless there is a sustained crypto rally, any upside is likely to be limited by the first major resistance level at $50,000. If the pivot level at $46,841 is breached, the first major support level at $45,084 comes into play. However, barring a prolonged crypto sell-off, Bitcoin should avoid falling below $45,000.

13400897,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/?p=227484,1644720492,Crypto Exchange Bit.com Will List LEASH and Bone on Spot Market,"Bit.com, one of the leading high-performing crypto exchanges, has announced to list LEASH and BONE on its spot market. From February 10, 2022at noon (UTC) platform will support the deposit and withdrawal of the two listed tokens. LEASH/USDT and BONE/USDT trading pairs will be available simultaneously on bit.com. LEASH and BONE are part of the Shiba Inu ecosystem In 2021, Shibu Inu &apos;barked&apos; the most, becoming the dog-themed crypto&apos;s alpha. Shiba INU (SHIB), Leash (Leash), and Bone (Bone) are the three tokens that make up the Shiba Inu ecosystem (BONE). The Shiba Inu ecosystem&apos;s most significant component is the SHIB token. LEASH and BONE are part of the Shiba Inu ecosystem, one of the most popular meme coins. LEASH, also known as &apos;Doge Killer,&apos; is designed to incentivize liquidity providers (LPs). Created initially as a rebase token (stablecoin), it is now &apos;released&apos; from any underpinning asset. BONE is touted as the potential governance DAO token for Shiba Inu&apos;s community, the very aptly named ShibaArmy. &apos;It may seem bizarre to many serious investors how meme tokens can easily grab the spotlight in crypto space. However, I would argue that these meme tokens explored another frontier of community movement, amassed by collective fondness, developed by community creativity, and contributed to by borderless participants. All of whom are utterly spontaneous and full of surprises.&apos; noted Toya Zhang, Chief Marketing Officer of bit.co...",POSITIVE,SHIB,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | ICO | MARKET | SHIB,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/crypto-exchange-bit-com-will-list-leash-and-bone-on-spot-market/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png
