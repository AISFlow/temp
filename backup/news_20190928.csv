42382745,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9snfV,1569701283,LedgerX Claims 'Personal Animus' Drove Ex-CFTC Chair to Stall Approvals,"LedgerX executives claim the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is treating them unfairly – because of a blog post.  According to two letters obtained by CoinDesk via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, LedgerX believes former CFTC Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo was personally biased against the company, and improperly used his position to delay the approval of an amended Derivatives Clearing Organization registration.  “We have strong reason to believe that this unreasonable delay that is in clear violation of the Commodity Exchange Act is related to the Chairman's animus towards a blog post written by our CEO,” the first letter, dated July 3, 2019, states.  Giancarlo could not be immediately reached for comment. We will update this article if we hear back. LedgerX CEO Paul Chou told CoinDesk in a phone call Saturday that the letters are accurate, and consist of only some of the messages sent to the agency.  In the first letter, the company alleges that former Chair Giancarlo threatened the company, saying:  ""In January [2019], the Chairman called one of our board members and told him that he was going to make sure our DCO order was revoked within two weeks, due to a blog post written by myself the previous year implying that preferential treatment was being given to larger companies so he could 'cement his legacy.' This refers to the ICE / Bakkt approval, which was running into issues that were frustrating the chairman.""  It is unclear which blog post specifically this letter refers to.  ""This has been a long-going dispute,"" Chou said, adding that the company was told in November 2018 that its DCO amendment application ""would go very quickly,"" and that he finds it suspicious that it has not yet been approved.  CFTC spokesperson Michael Short told CoinDesk that he could not speak to the allegations in the letters, but generally, ""the CFTC treats all registered entities equally,"" and LedgerX's business requires ""extensive consideration.""  Interference claims  The CFTC asked LedgerX to acquire insurance and conduct a SOC 1 Type 2 audit, which aims to ensure that a company’s controls are sufficient for its legal or technical mandate. Both of these conditions ""were entirely bogus,"" LedgerX said in its letter. However, agency officials later realized that the audit ""was not what they thought,"" it continued.  The letter alleged that a CFTC staffer tried to tamper with LedgerX's audit, with the unidentified auditors reportedly ""saying they had never seen this kind of thing before.""  On Sept. 28, LedgerX COO Juthica Chou repeated the claim on Twitter, writing:  ""Previous chairman wanted to revoke LX license bc Bakkt efforts not moving along. Having no legitimate reason to revoke our license, staff resorted to contacting our independent auditors to tamper with audit to give commission reason to revoke license. Staff admitted & apologized""  The agency's insurance request also apparently caused issues, after agency staffers realized that ""they would have to do consistent rulemaking across other potential applicants,” meaning ErisX and Bakkt would have to comply with the same standards.  According to the letter:  ""We [LedgerX] had conversations with division level heads that discussed how much of a mess this was and that one of them told me that he felt like 'a guard in a concentration camp, just following orders from the top.' These orders were completely divorced from the regulatory framework designed to impartially judge an application's merit and good standing, and in our view, was based entirely on a personal animus between [Giancarlo] and me because of my blog post.""  This claim was repeated in the second letter, dated July 11, 2019, when LedgerX noted that its DCO amendment application had been outstanding for nearly 250 days (now more than 300 days). The CFTC has 180 days to approve or deny an application under federal law, though it is unclear what happens if it does not.  The CFTC's Short said that the review process ""became prolonged due to repeated changes in the company's licensing strategy.""  Deference to ICE  The letters also note that the CFTC's swap data repository (SDR) requirements require LedgerX to report to the Intercontinental Exchange's ICE Trade Vault, which last year announced it would be launching a competing product to LedgerX in the form of Bakkt.  ""At a meeting of the technology advisory committee an ICE employee admitted to me in private that they were watching our contract with great interest and they thought it to be the correct approach,"" the July 3 letter said, adding:  ""Later, we have on voice recording, when ICE staffers thought they had muted their side, that they were instructed to delay support for our SDR reporting so that we could not start trading — something we consider incredibly anticompetitive. We filed a formal complaint regarding this anti-competitive aspect which was not answered at all. A division head later admitted, in person, to our COO that I was correct in stating that certain entities were being preferentially treated by the Chariman's [sic] office.""  These alleged actions are taking a toll on the company. According to the letters, LedgerX has ""suffered considerable cost"" and lost multiple employees due to these issues.  LedgerX also claimed that an unnamed reporter ""at one of the most respected journalistic institutions in the world"" told the company that ""government insiders"" had been sharing information about the company's plans with ""large private sector competitors."" (Presumably, the competitor is ICE.)  LedgerX called these actions ""a gross violation"" of the Chairman's duty to enforce the law.  Bakkt goes live  LedgerX nearly beat Bakkt to launching physically delivered bitcoin futures contracts at the end of July. At the time, however, the CFTC contacted CoinDesk, which first reported the futures offering, to say the company had ""not yet been approved by the Commission"" to do so.  As a result, ICE's Bakkt became the first U.S. regulated company to offer the product earlier this month.  These compounding issues seemingly triggered a series of tweets from Paul and Juthica Chou after Bakkt went live on Sept. 23.  On Sept. 20, Fortune published a preview piece, writing that Bakkt would offer ""the first physically delivered crypto-currency contracts ever traded on a federally regulated exchange."" LedgerX has offered physically-delivered options contracts since 2017.  The Fortune article has since been updated to clarify that Bakkt offers ""the first physically delivered crypto-currency futures contracts ever traded on a federally regulated exchange"" (emphasis added).  After the article was published, Juthica Chou asked the CFTC on Twitter if it was ""going to issue a correction on this one."" After the Bakkt Twitter account shared a link to the article, she said in a subsequent tweet:  "".@CFTC also are you going to make them delete this tweet? (or to be more precise, is head of enforcement going to call them for tweeting an article with incorrect information, like they did for LedgerX?)""  Paul Chou told CoinDesk Saturday he was ""fired"" from the CFTC's Technology Advisory Committee, which will meet next on Oct. 3.  ""They didn't tell me why but I think it's pretty obvious why they did it,"" he said. ""One of the issues they were going to talk about ... was custody and LedgerX is essentially the only member that does custody right now so we were about to send Juthica.""  The CFTC contacted him on Friday evening to tell him he was being removed, he said.  Short told CoinDesk that the removal ""was a unanimous decision by the Commission.""  ""Paul's erratic and unprofessional behavior had the potential to distract from the important issues under consideration by the committee,"" he added.  Asked what his next steps are, Paul Chou only said:  ""I wish I knew.""

42382746,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sneF,1569669606,How Leverage Can Help With Bitcoin’s Price Discovery,"Bitcoin (BTC) is like any other asset class in that it captures value through organic price discovery conducted via trading activity on global exchanges.  Yet leverage and margin trading, in general, can help “turbo-charge” demand for an asset. They can also free up capital, thus increasing liquidity within a given market as traders look to use their capital elsewhere.  It’s an investment strategy of using borrowed money for the use of various financial tools to increase the potential return of an investment.  It’s also an efficient use of trading capital, valued by professionals because it allows them to trade large positions without committing 100 percent of their capital to a risky spot position.  For example, a trader that wanted to buy a thousand tokens at $1 apiece would only require a $100 of trading capital, depending on the leverage used, thereby leaving the remaining $900 available for additional trades.  [embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLRoB2EjPTU&fbclid=IwAR1IwCVaupnYIRk2cZ9n8EumMewSEMpaXZ6dfgxlXTZ3ROI36mjN9QNzmkY[/embed]  Why leverage matters for bitcoin  Often touted as the most liquid cryptocurrency asset available, BTC benefits from leverage and margin trading activity by allowing investors and traders to lock in a position while maintaining a portfolio of other cryptos. It also provides professionals and retail investors with additional tools to capture value in the crypto market. In effect, greater demand on the asset class vastly improves the potential for more accurate value capture through organic price discovery.  Participating in a live panel discussion at Invest: ASIA in Singapore, Lennix Lai, financial market director at OKEx told Coindesk:  ""If you can only buy or sell particular underlying tokens of bitcoin and you don't have the capability to short, basically speculate in another direction, then the market would be a lot more volatile because it would be entirely driven by sentiment.""  ""For example, you can view bitcoin as being much more volatile before CME Futures were introduced ... so we should have more financial instruments like options to assist further in the price discovery process in relation to volatility,"" he said.  Greater access to capital means greater liquidity, without actually increasing the number of traders in a given market. It provides a means for increasing capital inflow without attracting any new money.  And while the total market capitalization of the crypto market has been on the slide alongside declining total volume, the pressures from a bear market can be offset through leverage and margin trading.  What’s the risk?  Of course, the rewards don’t come without inherent risks, as a loss can lead to the liquidation of a trader’s capital and force spot prices lower. Such an event recently took place in BTC's futures market on Sept. 24 triggering a ""long squeeze"".  If the cryptocurrency underlying a trade moves in the opposite direction to what was expected, leverage can greatly amplify the potential losses. To manage the risk associated, traders usually implement a strict trading style that includes the use of stop orders and limit orders designed to curb potential losses.  Also speaking on the panel in Singapore, Sunny Ray, head of global business development at the Kraken crypto exchange, explained how exchanges protect themselves from that risk:  ""If there's a lot of volatility in the market, if the value of the asset drops below 20 or 30 percent, there is something called a margin call that takes place where a company will actually liquidate the customer's assets to cover some of those losses.""  There are currently eight major exchanges that offer the ability to leverage crypto, with several others offering margin trading accounts such as Kraken, Binance and Deribitm, while Bakkt's release of its futures product on Sept. 23 adds to the opportunities for more authentic price discoveries.

42382760,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9snvr,1569638855,This North Syrian School Is a Baby Step Toward a Blockchain Society,"Rachel-Rose O’Leary is a reporter at CoinDesk covering how cryptocurrencies are being used in areas of economic, social and political unrest. This article is part of her series from Rojava, Syria.  ""It's a first for Rojava and a first for the Middle East.""  That's how 22-year-old programming student Mohamed Abdullah describes the Open Academy – a new school in North Syria, a de-facto autonomous region also known as Rojava.  The Open Academy is tackling one of the region's greatest hurdles: the lack of education for young people as result of the Syrian Civil War.  North Syria achieved partial autonomy from Damascus in 2012. Since then, it has pioneered a form of government known as democratic confederalism and led the offensive against ISIS, the militant jihadist group that once held huge portions of Iraq and Syria.  ""I had to pass through ISIS-held areas to get to university,"" Abdullah told me, ""I saw a lot of terrible things. They say the best part of life is university, but we didn't live it as that.""  North Syria has been researching how technologies such as blockchain could complement its societal model, which is built on an ethos of decentralization.  Many of the students of the Open Academy are curious about bitcoin and blockchain, believing it offers dependability after years of turmoil.  ""I don't trust the Syrian pound, I don't trust the American dollar, they are just paper. But bitcoin yes, we can trust it,"" Abdullah said.  Before the war, Damascus forbade the Kurds from learning their own language and suppressed tech education. Schools adopted a highly authoritarian style, and corporal punishment was common.  Kurdish students can now study Kurdish, but North Syria’s education system has a lot of catching up to do in the tech field. Before delivering on blockchain projects, students need to master the basics of coding, all while coping with limited resources and the constant threat of conflict.  ""This is a long development. It will take years,"" says Redur Daristan, an electronics student from Afrin.  Decentralized politics  In the past six months, North Syria’s government has established learning centers across the territory (home to about 20 million people), each providing free tuition in tech and philosophy.  As well as studying code, students work through a reading list of world history and cultural theory, and the works of Kurdish ideologue Abdullah Ocalan, the imprisoned Kurdish leader who inspired the North Syrian revolution.  According to officials, these texts enable students analyze the origin of prevailing political and economic theories and help situate the Civil War in a larger history of ideas.  ""The main purpose of [our efforts] is to solve the problems of society,"" said Azad Maxmud, one of the teachers at the Open Academy (everyday problems include war, economic pressure, broken infrastructure, and increasing water shortages). ""The reason they study sociology, history and philosophy is to be aware of the problems and cut them from the root.""  Ocalan, who has been incarcerated on the Turkish prison island İmralı‎ for the last 20 years, advanced developed democratic confederalism from his prison cell, which is a model for a stateless society that can exist without government oversight.  The theory helped shape North Syria’s governance structure, which consists of communes where people come together to take decisions at a local level. It’s here, Maxmud says, where blockchain can play a unique role. Using a distributed ledger for public accounting, communes can make their spending transparent and better manage collective resources, he argues.  ""The economics of the federation consists of managing the resources between one commune and another. Blockchain can serve a big role in this,"" he says.  The role of women  Women will play a key role in this development, Gerdun Sterk, a French woman who leads the media arm of the Open Academy, told me.  By offering women free education in technology and philosophy, North Syria can set an example not just for the Middle East, but all over the world, she argued. She cited gender imbalances across the technology industry – especially in blockchain – as an example of why this is necessary.  Sterk's argument aligns with the aims of the broader North Syria project.  Women's liberation has been a defining feature of the North Syrian revolution, with women actively encouraged to participate in the region's governance. Many have also played a role in the armed struggle against ISIS.  According to Sterk, technology faces a similar struggle to the military when it comes to women's involvement.  ""There's a similar narrative in tech as in the military, that women aren't strong enough, they won't understand it, and so on,"" she said. “At the beginning, it was a big effort to inspire women to take their role in the armed struggle. It was difficult culturally.”  Technology can give women a political voice. ""It’s an opportunity to shape society according to their own perspectives,"" Sterk said. ""Women can take part in developing decentralized technologies that are adapted to the needs of society.""  A new kind of education  Many young people in North Syria have been deprived of an education as a result of the war. Now some are too disillusioned to return. As such, the Academy is testing educational methods that are adapted to students who have lived through tyranny and war. In particular, it aims to teach students how to learn by themselves, so they don’t rely on a teacher figure.  It’s also designed to give the young people of North Syria hope in rebuilding their society – something that has been steadily eroded after 8 years of brutal conflict.  Daristan, the electronics student now at the academy, is originally from Afrin, one of North Syria's most vibrant cities before Turkish forces seized it in 2018. She was walking to university to collect exam papers when the first bombs on Afrin started to fall.  The experience changed her feelings about traditional education. ""In university, I can't focus on study or the appeal of having a degree. It doesn't mean anything to me now,"" she said through a translator.  Daristan was forced out of Afrin following the invasion. She spent 6 months in a refugee camp before leaving to attend university. Now she skips class and spends her days coding in the school’s hack-labs.  She told CoinDesk:  ""Technology has a real goal to it. In the Open Academy there is a vision, there is a goal. That is highly motivating and appealing.""  Note: For security reasons, the names of the people quoted in this article have been changed.

The NBA said Friday that Dinwiddie's plan to pledge part of his contract earnings for a security token offering violates the league's collective bargaining agreement, according to the New York Times.  ""The described arrangement is prohibited by the C.B.A., which provides that ‘no player shall assign or otherwise transfer to any third party his right to receive compensation from the team under his uniform player contract,’"" the league said.  Dinwiddie appeared to disagree with the assessment, writing on Twitter, ""The architecture by definition is not an assignment lol FUD.""  It is unclear if the NBA spoke to Dinwiddie before providing the statement to the Times. However, the Brooklyn Nets guard indicated that he had told the league about his intentions before they were publicly announced, writing, ""to put this quite simply I’m not assigning my contract and have been explicit in that when I’ve spoken to them.""  ""The news tonight is disappointing because all it does is inspire #FUD in the birth of a previously unrealized asset class under the assumption that I’m breaking a rule that I’ve been clear I’m not breaking in multiple conversation,"" he wrote, concluding:  ""I look forward to an understanding because as I stated in the previous articles it was made with the @NBA in mind. Hopefully being able to bring added fan engagement to the different players/teams and liquidity for team owners.""  A publicist for Dinwiddie did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for the NBA sent CoinDesk the same statement shared with the Times.  Fan shares  Dinwiddie revealed Thursday that he intended to tokenize part of his contract on the ethereum blockchain, in order to raise $13.5 million from his three-year, $35 million contract (Dinwiddie is set to make $16 million in his first year).  As part of the DREAM Fan Shares platform, Dinwiddie outlined a company where any entertainer could tokenize their contract, raising part of their salary upfront to invest or otherwise use immediately. Token holders would receive Dinwiddie's regular salary payments, recouping their investments and earning interest.  Paxos Trust Company was set to provide custody and escrow services for the project, paying investors out in the Paxos Standard stablecoin. The company was unavailable for comment on Friday.  Dinwiddie's plan is receiving public support: on Friday, presidential candidate Andrew Yang, who has praised blockchain in the past and suggested a federal framework for cryptocurrency regulation, wrote that he thought the plan was ""genius."" He added that he was ""disappointed the NBA is disallowing it.""  Earlier Friday, Dinwiddie also revealed that he had partnered with the Tron Foundation and its CEO, Justin Sun, to donate 8.2 bitcoin to charity by selling his game-worn shoes for the 2019/2020 season.  He reassured fans that regardless of the NBA's possible issues with his contract plan, he would make the donation, writing:  ""Also, in case you were worried I’m still going to give the 8.2btc to charity from my shoes lol""  Spencer Dinwiddie image via Erik Drost/Wikimedia Commons",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | TOKEN SALE,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/09/28/nba-says-basketball-player-cant-tokenize-his-contract-after-all,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a6db6287f237e3ba6863853ae904de86e475b2d5-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
