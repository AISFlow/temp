The coin has lost over 2.4% in the last 24 hours and is now trading in the $1,700 territory as of the time of writing this article. The digital asset continues to dip as the crypto market continues to experience massive losses. Ethereum has now lost over 50% from its all-time high in April when the coin had shot past $4,000. Holders continue to remain bullish on the coin as upgrades promise new and exciting things in the future of the digital asset.

Related Reading | Ethereum 2.0 Contract Reaches 100,000 ETH Milestone But now a whole other question has arisen in regards to Ethereum, and that is if the digital asset will ever become deflationary. Unlimited ETH Supply Given the structure of Ethereum, it is not a stretch to say that the digital asset does not possess any hard cap. The network is structured that for every new block created, two ETH coins are produced. Then this means that as long as people continue to use the network, then more ETH coins will continue to be created. An unlimited supply of any currency or asset puts that asset or currency at risk for inflation. Thus, Ethereum&apos;s model remains an inflationary one due to there being no cap on the overall supply of ETH.

At the time of writing, the first cryptocurrency by market cap trades at $29,605 with an 11.2% loss in the weekly chart. The crypto market has followed Bitcoin, except for a handful of coins, and the top ten sit on more pronounced losses. For three consecutive months, BTC and major cryptocurrencies have been in the red. May and June saw two capitulation events that pushed BTC&apos;s price below its current levels. Hence why so many investors and traders expect further downside to consolidating a third and possibly final capitulation. The weeks leading to the most recent crash saw Ethereum (ETH) outperforming Bitcoin (BTC). The second cryptocurrency by market cap rose from around $1,600 to $2,390 before retracing to current levels. However, a recent report by Arcane Research concluded that BTC remains the best performer in the crypto market. In consequence, the BTC Dominance has increased as altcoins are pushed further down their support levels. As seen below, the Bitcoin Dominance stood at 46.92% by the time the report was published with ETH following with a 16.96%.

So go the rules of the S&P’s new benchmark for the crypto sector.      CoinDesk obtained a list of the 243 digital assets in the S&P Cryptocurrency Broad Digital Market (BDM) Index. A cursory analysis found that Wall Street’s latest attempt to measure returns from the “broad investable universe” ventured to crypto’s outermost rings.      An eclectic mix of name-brand blockchains and lesser-known protocols are included in S&P’s BDM. Weighted according to the index-maker’s rulebook, the coins’ collective returns crunch down to a point-based performance figure. That figure hovered around 2,676 at press time, down 14% for the month of July.      For comparison, S&P’s bitcoin tracker showed it down 450.86 points, or 11.5%, in the same time period.      BDM certainly featured bitcoin and its end-of-June market cap of over $650 billion. But the index, whose average market cap was $4.8 billion according to S&P, largely consisted of small- and mid-cap cryptos whose stories are unknown to the average banker.    Read more: S&P Dow Jones Launches 5 More Crypto Indexes; One Tracks 240 Coins    One such token is skycoin, a $15 million small-cap with about $387,000 in trading volume. CoinGecko ranked it in the 660 neighborhood by valuation. In November 2018, now-deceased crypto iconoclast John McAfee had the coin’s logo tattooed on his back.      The index snubs some notable coins. XRP does not make the cut. Neither does monero or BSV.      That might be a result of S&P’s inclusion policies. The committee overseeing BDM can nix a coin that “may be an unregistered security,” that has “privacy features” or that faces “potential market disruption,” according to governance documents.      But dogecoin, the bitcoin spin-off that best encapsulated the zany boom times of memecoin season, is nowhere on the list.      An FAQ page explains that coins must have a white paper to make the cut.

42387309,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBmRSZ,1626813067,Market Wrap: What’s Next for Bitcoin After Break Below $30K,"Bitcoin stabilized around $29,600 at press time Tuesday after breaking below the important $30,000 level on Monday. The world’s largest cryptocurrency has been in a downtrend trend since failing to hold an all-time high around $63,000 in April. Concerns about regulatory risks, less accommodative monetary policy and fading institutional demand have contributed to selling pressure over the past few months.      Edward Moya, analyst at the foreign exchange brokerage firm Oanda, described bitcoin’s trading environment as a “tug of war between bears and bulls,” in an email to CoinDesk.      “Bitcoin’s longer-term bullish outlook depends on some mainstream adoption across the U.S. and Europe, and for some that appears to be at risk,” wrote Moya.    Latest prices    Cryptocurrencies:    Bitcoin (BTC) $29,814.97, -3.13%  Ether (ETH) $1,792.4, -1.86%    Traditional markets:    S&P 500: 4324, +1.54%  Gold: $1809.9, -0.2%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.213%, compared with 1.201% on Monday    The European Union Commission is proposing a revamp of anti-money laundering rules, which could include banning anonymous crypto asset wallets. That did not help market sentiment on Tuesday, according to Moya.    “We see that at the federal and state levels, the falling price of bitcoin and resulting financial losses for many retail investors will only focus more regulatory scrutiny on this market,” wrote Timothy Butlerhttps://www.troutman.com/professionals/timothy-a-butler.html, partner at Troutman Pepper, in an email to CoinDesk.    Aside from regulatory uncertainty, traders will also be alert for comments from Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who is scheduled to speak at The B Word conference on Wednesday. Musk’s appearance is especially timely given the potential for bitcoin to drop towards $25,000, which would mean Tesla could suffer a $300 million hit to its earnings, according to Shawn Tully, a senior editor at Fortune.    Bitcoin volatility    Short-term implied volatility rose as bitcoin broke below $30,000, indicating that cryptocurrency options traders see sharp price moves ahead. Volume, however, remains low, in the $20,000 to $30,000 price range.      “Continued pressure at these levels could see continuation to the downside,” wrote Nathan Cox, chief investment officer at digital asset investment firm Two Prime, in an email to CoinDesk.    Futures backwardation    Bitcoin futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) have shifted into ""backwardation,"" which is when futures trade at a discount to the spot price. This is the second time that regulated futures on the CME are trading at backwardation in the last seven days, according to a Tuesday report by Arcane Research.      “Institutional investors seem very cautious at the moment, and in general seem to be in the process of de-risking,” Arcane wrote.      “The declining trend in the futures market indicates that fear is accumulating as long as traders are no longer willing to pay a premium for their exposure.”    Bitcoin drawdown    Bitcoin’s drawdown, or the percentage decline from the April peak around $63,000, is roughly 50%. Typically, drawdowns that exceed 50% can last for several months, similar to 2018 and the second-half of 2019.      Two decisive daily closes below $30,000 are needed to confirm a breakdown, wrote Katie Stockton, managing director of Fairlead Strategies, in an email to CoinDesk. For now, secondary support is at $27,000, which bitcoin will need to hold in order to maintain a long-term uptrend.    Weak institutional demand    The Purpose Exchange-Traded Fund, one of the first approved bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs), has seen a slowdown in net inflows this week after experiencing a period of relatively strong demand in May and June, according to a report by Glassnode.      The slowdown suggests institutional demand for the largest currency by market cap remains weak across these regulated products, according to Glassnode.    Where to from here    Among 42 cryptocurrency experts surveyed by Finder, 61% think that bitcoin is currently undervalued, while the experts on average expect bitcoin to reach $66,284 per BTC by the end of 2021.      “Adoption by corporations and institutional investors paired with a loose monetary policy and high asset inflation will propel bitcoin to six figures before the end of this year,” Morpher CEO Martin Fröehler, the most bullish among the panelists, told Finder.      University of Canberra senior lecturer John Hawkins, one of the most bearish panelists, said that government adoption of bitcoin will adversely affect the cryptocurrency’s price. “I’m assuming El Salvador adopting it as legal tender puts a floor for a while. But after the price has dropped a lot, they may remove the legal tender status.”    Altcoin roundup  DOGE: A recent shakeout in meme tokens, a sector best known by the Shiba Inu-themed dogecoin, indicates that retail investors are exiting their positions in cryptocurrencies as recent market sell-offs have spooked many crypto newcomers. Momentum appears to have dissipated in an oversaturated market for meme coins, wrote CoinDesk’s Muyao Shen.  USDC: Circle, a global payments company, was one of USDC’s creators. It published a breakdown of its assets backing the stablecoin for the first time in its latest attestation report, which was dated July 16. According to the report, about 61% of its tokens are backed by “cash and cash equivalents,” meaning cash and money market funds, wrote CoinDesk’s Nikhilesh De.

42387304,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBmRL1,1626812112,China's Digital Inequality Dilemma: Open-Source Innovation vs. Control,"We got at least a hint of fresh insight yesterday into China’s ongoing crackdown on big tech companies, which recently swept up ride-share service Didi Chuxing and the fintech-focused Ant Group. At least one underreported goal of the crackdown is “to reduce inequality and promote what the party calls ‘collective prosperity,’” according to a new report by the New York Times’ Li Yuan. With China’s economic growth slowing, Yuan writes that “the country’s rising inequality is becoming a time bomb in the eyes of the [Communist] party.”      That could be dismissed as empty rhetoric in service of a power play if the Chinese authorities weren’t so focused on so-called digital platforms, which are believed to be drivers of inequality by an array of experts around the globe. Yuan cites an unnamed venture capitalist claiming that, by contrast, semiconductor and artificial intelligence firms are considered “first-class companies” developing “’real’ technologies,” and are being largely left alone.    Centralized platforms, inequality and the alternatives    Digital platforms are companies that serve as middlemen in a variety of markets, such as Amazon in e-commerce, Facebook in social media, or Uber and Airbnb for services. They collect large amounts of data about both sellers and buyers, and leverage that data to grow. According to a large body of research from economists and social scientists, though, this business model inherently creates inequality because of its reliance on economies of scale and network effects, which, among other impacts, tend naturally toward monopoly.      But those platforms are also gigantic economic engines, dominant in part thanks to the inherent efficiencies they create. It’s extremely unlikely China would shut them down and sacrifice economic dynamism in the name of inequality – the power of the Chinese Communist Party depends too much on continued domestic prosperity.      There is a third path, both for China and the rest of the world. Though the concept is still nascent, blockchain-based systems, such as decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), could capture the efficiency of large two-sided marketplaces, but without the centralization that creates inequality. Instead, the benefits would accrue to platform users in the form of higher revenues or lower costs. They could also potentially give a platform’s users, including buyers and sellers, more input into the design of the overall system using blockchain governance techniques. (I wrote about this concept in more depth back in 2014.)      But China, it would appear from its ongoing and recently accelerated crackdown on bitcoin, is even more hostile to truly decentralized technology than it is to inequality.      This likely obscures the simpler, deeper motive, which is to make examples of a few prominent figures to cement the Communist Party’s hold on power. Yuan writes that private companies in China are “likely to lose what’s left of their independence and become a mere appendage of the state.” I’m not sure I agree that’s the likely outcome after China’s private sector has done such a good job of raising the country’s standard of living, but it’s certainly directionally correct.      But there is a very real reason for China to be concerned about inequality: It leads to social instability and unrest. That’s true in general, with examples ranging from Lebanon and Chile to the United States. China has seen it firsthand in Hong Kong: Though less remarked on in the West, soaring poverty and a high cost of living were factors in the massive 2019 protests there, alongside resistance to mainland political encroachment. This is a particular threat to the Chinese Communist Party, because its continued control depends to a great degree on its ability to deliver increasing prosperity – and higher inequality makes people feel poorer.    The winner-take-all society    To be clear, there is much more to the story of inequality than the rise of digital platform technologies. Its possible causes in various contexts include huge declines in top marginal tax rates, the increasing education requirements of well-paying jobs, the shift of less-skilled work to developing countries and the increasing intensity of international corporate tax arbitrage. And that’s just for a start.      But many economists and social scientists argue that digital platforms are at the very least adding to rising global inequality.      Data is at the heart of the problem. Platform companies rely on data to efficiently connect buyers, sellers and products, whether it’s Facebook accurately targeting advertising or Uber quickly connecting drivers and riders. Scale is key, because more participants in a market make those buyer-seller connections more efficient – one version of the so-called “network effect.”      To a huge degree, platforms compete on the basis of the amount of data they gather. This privately held data eventually forms a classic anti-competitive “moat,” with the added twist that the biggest moat is usually owned by the first successful entrant into a market. It’s hard to imagine anyone ever catching up to the amount of search data gathered by Google over the past two decades, for example.      Once they’re established, critics argue, these data moats become something very close to monopolistic market positions. These allow platform companies to reap particularly huge profits because their services can be replicated globally for zero marginal cost. Zero marginal cost is a key distinction between today’s biggest companies and the industrial giants of the past, like General Electric: If GE had a hit toaster oven, it still had to produce the toasters, limiting its potential profits. Once Google builds a digital tool, by contrast, the tool can be reproduced infinitely for free.    Because it pays essentially nothing for each additional search it sells advertising against, its profits can grow to staggering dimensions: $17.93 billion in the first quarter of this year, for instance. And that’s with much smaller workforces than the industrial giants of yesteryear, adding to inequality by sending a greater share of revenue back to investors as profit and less of it to workers as wages. Stanford’s Mordecai Kurz found a huge increase in the concentration of monopolistic wealth among IT firmshttps://siepr.stanford.edu/research/publications/formation-capital-and-wealth-it-monopoly-power-and-rising-inequality between 1974 and 2015, with impacts including lower wages.    There’s at least one clear example of this centralization of profits being targeted by China’s crackdown. Beijing was “not happy,” Yuan writes, with the appearance last year of apps that sold vegetables. That’s because they could replace local vendors who rely on those sales for their livelihood, instead siphoning profits to a faraway tech company.      Essentially the same dynamic played out when Uber displaced the taxi industry, creating a wave of despair among drivers who lost their regulated high fares. Of course, the trade-off is clear here: Uber is vastly more convenient and easy to use than the old taxi system. Though Uber knowingly skirted the law during its growth, the U.S. generally tends to let innovators compete, even if it means the loss of jobs in outdated industries or models. China will have to strike a finer balance to protect its workers and wages without strangling innovation.      The platform focus of China’s crackdown, then, actually lines up with prior reporting that the CCP’s crackdown was focused on “cybersecurity.” That may have been meant in a slightly different sense than we usually use the term in the West, with the focus less on the risk that customer data will be stolen or misused and more on the harms of using data exactly the way platform companies intend.      The wealth-concentrating impact of platforms parallels a broader dynamic described in 1995’s ""The Winner-Take-All Society"" by economist Robert Frank and public policy professor Philip J. Cook. Frank and Cook argued, in part, that the rise of global media, including the internet, will concentrate greater and greater success in a small number of high-achieving individuals as improved communication connects them to a much larger pool of bidders for their talents. This increasingly applies to all fields, and explains some (though not all) of the rising difference between, for example, CEO and worker pay.      This mobility and self-maximalization for the most talented is arguably the core of contemporary capitalism, and for years China allowed it to uncomfortably coexist with its collectivist ideology. That, it now appears, has run as far as the CCP can allow. The problem for China is whether it can foster innovation while reining in high achievers like Jack Ma.    Web 3.0 fixes this (but not for China)    If China’s concerns about platforms and the concentration of wealth are valid, it’s unclear how they might address the problem. The current crackdown has been harsh, but it’s impractical in the long term to simply shut down platforms like Didi. There’s simply too much to be gained from the efficiencies of digital marketplaces.      There is an alternative to centralized platforms – though quite ironically, it’s likely unavailable to China. Decentralized, blockchain-based structures could in theory be used to manage, for example, an open-source version of a matching engine like Uber’s. Once established, they would direct a greater share of overall profits to workers, whether vegetable vendors or drivers, while retaining the benefits of a huge shared marketplace.      For such systems to work long term, they’d need to share Bitcoin’s security, durability and true decentralization - the kind of system in which trust and uncensorability are two inseparable sides of the same coin. But China’s crackdown on bitcoin mining and, even more so, the decentralization theater of its digital yuan, suggest that genuinely open blockchain systems are not part of China's game plan. Among other risks it can’t seem to stomach are international capital flight and crypto speculation - ways in which, if we’re being honest, blockchain finance can itself drive inequality.      That’s the irony of China’s situation: It can seemingly neither allow the disproportionate concentration of wealth that rises from centralized data platforms, nor the chaotic self-direction at the heart of more egalitarian digital systems. The only other alternative that seems immediately plausible would be state control of centralized digital platforms. That would be a throwback to the even more rigid authoritarian Communism that led to such mismanagement and abuse in the middle of the 20th century, and it’s hard to imagine it turning out better on replay.      After the reforms of Deng Xiaoping, China managed to create industrialized prosperity for its subjects without sacrificing its fundamental control. But it now finds itself on the horns of a much more difficult digital dilemma.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET,David Z.

On Tuesday, Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.), chair of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said he would investigate how “cryptocurrency can embolden cybercriminals” and what the federal government can do to fight back.      Coming less than a week after the Senate Judiciary Committee said it would hold its own ransomware hearing, the dual probes speak to the heightened attention crypto is facing from U.S. lawmakers.      Peters’ probe is notable because of its focus on cryptocurrency, instead of ransomware more generally. Lawmakers seldom train their investigative sights on crypto specifically. But the recent tsunami of ransomware attacks against everything from pipelines to meatpackers has changed that.      Attacks were up 150% in 2020 with $412 million in ransoms paid, Peters said, adding that an ongoing July attack is holding 200 corporate networks hostage for $70 million.      “The increased use of cryptocurrencies as the preferred method of payment in ransomware attacks shows that cybercriminals believe they can commit attacks without being held accountable,” Peters said in a statement.      Even so, Peters’ investigation appears to be leaving room for a different crypto narrative.      The investigation will examine current oversight efforts and regulations related to virtual currencies. It will also make recommendations into how lawmakers and federal agencies can ensure all Americans can safely benefit from access to cryptocurrencies, and that they are not providing an incentive for criminal organizations and foreign adversaries to continue assaulting American networks and communities nationally.",NEUTRAL,없음,REGULATION,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/07/20/senate-to-investigate-cryptos-role-in-cybercrime,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a14e307a0d1dfe29a306b2a4ba81c4618b48e223-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411647,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glQ6rL,1626800334,DeFi Isn't Better Than TradFi if People Can't Use It,"I am on a Zoom call with a woman from Shiraz, Iran, who is currently working as a freelance designer and is running a course that educates local populations on the fundamentals of blockchain and decentralized finance (DeFi).      The dominant narrative seems to be that in Iran, cryptocurrencies play an important role in helping people buy imports as one way of coping with the pressure of sanction, but the reality – as my interviewee assures me – is way harsher.    Ann Brody is a Ph.D. student in Communication Studies at McGill University, where she researches blockchain technology and culture. This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    Imagine you live in a place where you are denied access to basic services like Spotify and Netflix and then you stumble upon blockchain, which finally grants you the freedom to participate in these kinds of services and transact with anyone you want in the world. Then one day you log into your MetaMask wallet and realize that you can’t connect to the network and view your balance because you’ve just been geo-blocked.      “For a moment I thought that all my hard-earned revenue had just evaporated into thin air. Because I live in Iran, I can’t access basic web services, and now I can’t even access decentralized finance. How is that fair?” the freelance designer asks me.    Read more: Iranian President Wants to Regulate Crypto ‘as Soon as Possible’    Geo-blocking IPs is now becoming a common practice among blockchain and cryptocurrency companies that are actively trying to legally protect themselves from engaging with sanctioned entities. Geo-blocking sets limits on access to online content based on a user’s physical location by monitoring the user’s IP address.      Crypto’s philosophy of decentralization is premised on the belief that everyone should be able to participate in decentralized finance. Yet, what appears to be happening is that many people around the world can’t find an entry point into it in the first place.      Every day, hundreds of Iranian users are getting kicked out of international online cryptocurrency exchanges, with their funds getting frozen for unknown periods of time – and often, they don’t even get that money back. This is unfortunate considering the Iranian population is already unable to participate in social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Telegram without the use of VPNs and even applications like GitHub and Slack, which are important for collaborative work.    Even if crypto isn't fully decentralized, it's perhaps more open than or equally as accessible as its alternatives.    Although these restrictions can be bypassed using VPN services, this also requires issuing another level of trust to shady services that are not always reliable, contradicting blockchain’s purpose. In essence this means people residing in sanctioned countries are being denied access to services both internally and externally, and the promise of decentralization seems to apply only to some populations and completely disregard others.      To be sure, even if crypto isn't fully decentralized, it's perhaps more open than or equally as accessible as its alternatives and certainly offers many benefits. For instance, it can enable people to participate in certain financial and market applications without having extensive knowledge in trading and investment in contrast to traditional finance.      But to ensure that decentralized finance succeeds in areas where traditional finance has failed, developers and other stakeholders in this community have to start addressing issues pertaining to regulation and reframing the narrative around “decentralization.” By embracing a more sober outlook on what this technology can and cannot do in its present social and political context, only this way will we be able to construct more robust tools that will hopefully serve more than the needs of wealthy financial interests.      Next time you stumble on the profile of a crypto company with a mission statement that starts with something along the lines of “making a more accessible financial system,” it’s a good idea to take a pause and reflect on the following questions: To whom is this financial system being made more accessible? Who is getting to decide what decentralization means and what it should look like?      If decentralized finance is being built for those already in power and can’t serve the needs of those who need it the most, then it’s really no better than traditional finance.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Ann Brody,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/07/20/defi-isnt-better-than-tradfi-if-people-cant-use-it,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/69e39c55aa830cde137af02dabf519411ed1f4a6-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42387308,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBmRRJ,1626797232,Meme Tokens Set for Third Straight Monthly Loss as Retail Traders Flee Dogecoin Copycats,"Have dog-themed meme tokens had their day or are they just playing dead?      A recent shakeout in meme tokens, a sector best known by the Shiba Inu-themed dogecoin (DOGE), indicates that retail investors are exiting their positions in cryptocurrencies as recent market sell-offs have spooked many crypto newcomers.      But analysts and traders are divided on whether retail interest in meme tokens will return anytime soon to this community-driven, less serious part of the crypto market.      Meme tokens posted massive gains earlier this year, inspired by Tesla CEO Elon Musk-touted dogecoin, which posted a four-month-long winning streak. In April alone, the price of dogecoin rose 528.4% on Hong Kong-based crypto exchange FTX, according to TradingView.       Following the dogecoin phenomenon, numerous meme coins were launched, including the doge-imitator shiba inu token, as a new obsession with the meme culture worldwide sparked a wave of interest in the tokens. The GameStop stock trading mania earlier this year just fueled the frenzy.      “The [meme token] market becomes oversaturated with pointless meme coins,” Arcane Research analyst Vetle Lunde said.      Though there were countless other canine-themed coins listed such as dogelon mars (ELON), and doggy (DOGGY), the area wasn’t restricted to just dogecoin wannabes. There was also CUMROCKET (CUMMIES), a token that powers a non-fungible token marketplace for the adult entertainment industry and loser coin (LOWB), a token representing a self-deprecating culture in China.       “I think it highlights the aggressive nature of the risk-on flow that was prevalent during that period,” Denis Vinokourov, head of research at Synergia Capital, said. “Fundamentals per se did not matter or mattered less to a degree, and in the end, it became a very crowded momentum trade.”      That momentum appears to have dissipated. Data compiled by CoinDesk research shows that dogecoin was already in the red during May, while smaller meme tokens were posting some gains. A month later, however, almost all of the 10 meme tokens from CoinMarketCap turned tail and followed the pack leader in posting negative returns in June.       Doge’s price is down by 35.3% in July so far, according to TradingView and FTX, indicating that the No. 1 meme token by market capitalization is likely to close the month at a loss again.    An oversaturated meme market    The once white-hot sector in crypto has faced unprecedented selling pressure since the broader market sell-off in May, partly due to “a reduced presence of new retail investors,” according to Lunde.      In Asia, where the crypto market is dominated by retail investors, the recent crackdown in China on crypto trading and bitcoin mining also has hurt the meme tokens.      China’s crackdown “is making it harder for people to invest new money into the market, and rumors of further regulations on centralized exchanges have raised concerns about further investing,” Rachel Lin, CEO of decentralized derivatives exchange SynFutures, said. “Many of the meme coin traders in Asia are also miners, so they are preoccupied with handling the crackdown and recovering their losses.”      Meme token craze “was over a while ago,” Annabelle Huang, a partner at Hong Kong-based Amber Group, said. “Then it’s all about the mining ban and the ‘great migration’ [in China] as I call it.”    Speculative traders eye next big thing    For some analysts, it is clear that those speculative traders, who once loved the high returns from the meme tokens, have moved on to the next hot project, evidenced by the rise of Axie Infinity in recent weeks.      “This summer is so far turning out to be the summer of crypto game projects,” Arcane’s Lunde said, warning that the gaming sector, potentially, is also facing or will face an over-exuberant market, similar to what happened with meme tokens.      At their peak reached just last week, AXS tokens had a total market capitalization of more than $1 billion, compared with French video-game company Ubisoft’s market value at around $7 billion.      “I think it is safe to say the bulls might be a bit too optimistic at the moment,” Lunde said.      At press time, AXS was trading at around $15.4, according to data from Messari, down by 46.3% from its all-time high of $28.66 on July 15.      Synergia Capital's Vinokourov, citing unwinding bitcoin carry trades with the one-month bitcoin futures contract moving into backwardation, said that more cash is sitting on the sidelines at the moment rather than being put into crypto.      The cash-and-carry trade – meaning shorting futures and taking a long position in an asset to profit from a tightening of the spread between the futures' price and the spot price – has become less attractive to traders as the difference between the price of the futures contract and the spot price on an annualized time frame has fallen significantly recently.      The crypto market needs a much stronger “risk-on” mood before meme tokens can, if at all, make another comeback, he said.    Legacy (and some hopes) remain    But not all are so pessimistic about where meme tokens are heading.      “Beyond speculation, these meme coins have actually seen great traction in the wider crypto ecosystem, particularly when used as a tip for content on social media,” Jay Hao, CEO of crypto exchange OKEx, told CoinDesk via a spokesperson. “It is especially interesting to see millennials get involved with these meme coins.”      Hao said if the meme tokens’ creators and communities can help build a better infrastructure, the tokens have the potential to turn into “robust utility tokens” that are beyond the jokes or the culture they represent.      Despite the disappointing prices, the dogecoin community, for example, remains active: A new fee structure for dogecoin was proposed at the end of May by its core developers to reduce overall transaction costs.Last week, eToro, an exchange that mainly caters to “social” or beginner traders, reported that dogecoin became the fifth-most held crypto on the exchange after having been listed less than two months.      And chief dogecoin booster Musk has posted several tweets regarding the meme token this month, though his ability to make the Shiba Inu-represented token jump isn’t what it once was.      OKEx’s Hao said that the limited access to crypto investments poses a major challenge for crypto newbies to continue to invest in the market after first being attracted by the meme tokens.      “It would be an easier first step for them to use traditional channels such as [exchange-traded funds], or if banks operated as custodians,” he said. “Then we would have retail investors ... continue to invest in up-and-coming [alternative tokens] and in [decentralized finance] – with an understanding that gains may no longer happen overnight and that profits will come by playing the long game.”",NEGATIVE,AXS | DOGE,AXS | DOGE | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/07/20/meme-tokens-set-for-third-straight-monthly-loss-as-retail-traders-flee-dogecoin-copycats,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/73ca0d86c13c1eb13779b8654177dbf6d12fcf3c-2048x1534.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42387307,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBmRQ3,1626797085,Institutional Demand for Bitcoin Remains Weak: Glassnode,"The Purpose Exchange-Traded Fund, one of the first approved bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs), has seen a slowdown in net inflows this week after experiencing a period of relatively strong demand in May and June, according to a report by Glassnode.      “The week closed with the largest net outflow of -90.76 BTC since mid-May,” said the report.      The slowdown suggests institutional demand for the largest currency by market cap remains weak across these regulated products, according to Glassnode.      The bitcoin price fell early Tuesday below the crucial support level of $30,000 for the first time in four weeks. As of press time, bitcoin was trading around $29,960.      While data tracked by Glassnode shows weak institutional demand, the situation is somewhat encouraging in Europe.      “This is only $3 million of outflows,"" said Laurent Kssis, managing director of ETPs at 21Shares AG. ""In Europe, some ETP bitcoin have seen larger outflows in one day.”      Also contributing to the bearish case for bitcoin is the performance of the Grayscale (GBTC) bitcoin trust share price. The GBTC shares continued to trade last week at a notable discount to the fund's net asset value, ranging between 11% and down to 15.3%, demonstrating lackluster demand for the cryptocurrency, according to Glassnode.

42387289,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBmOdh,1626796856,MakerDAO Moves to Full Decentralization; Maker Foundation to Close in 'Months',"The original decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol started out decentralized and to decentralization it will return.      The Maker Foundation has announced it is turning over operations entirely to its decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), MakerDAO, as founder Rune Christensen has long promised.      ""The Foundation will formally dissolve within the next few months,"" Christensen wrote in a blog post shared in advance with CoinDesk. No more specific timeline was offered.      MakerDAO has been wildly influential within crypto, especially the Ethereum community.      It has more often than not had the most assets locked in its smart contracts of any other DeFi protocol. Its founders pioneered the DAO structure early on only to formalize into a traditional organizational structure in 2018, which engendered internal tension and division.      MakerDAO is best known as the creator of the DAI stablecoin, but DAI is enabled by a lending system that has allowed many crypto holders to make use of their assets without selling them.      The Maker Foundation is the formal organization that was created to steward the protocol through its early days until holders of the MKR token were ready to take on all aspects of stewarding the project, managing all its teams, making necessary upgrades and promoting its use around the world.      The intent was always to gradually decentralize the home office out of existence.      On Tuesday, Christensen wrote:    ""From the earliest days of Maker, everyone involved worked tirelessly to devise a framework for scientific governance and create an infrastructure for a new generation of open financial services that can be used by anyone, anywhere, anytime. We all hoped for success, but knew it would never be guaranteed. We realized that only a very independent, passionate, and committed Maker community could make success a reality in the end.""  Looking back    When CoinDesk spoke to Christensen in 2019, he seemed as though he was looking forward to a project he didn't have to be in charge of any longer. While Christensen has been preparing everyone for this move from the Foundation's earliest days, it echoes a move by a pioneering non-custodial exchange, ShapeShift, which also put the wheels of decentralization in motion this month, though that came as a surprise to everyone.      The Foundation was set up in 2018 at the behest of its early venture investors. In early 2019, this led to a rift between MKR holders and the organization, particularly in light of what one leaked legal letter described as a forced reconstitution of the foundation's leadership. A detailed recounting of that transitional period would later be reported out by Bloomberg.      Since then, though, the protocol has generally made strong progress.      In April 2020, Christensen rolled out a plan to reach decentralization, putting more power in the hands of community members and remunerating them for their time.      As noted, it has remained one of the dominant forces in DeFi, found ways to improve itself and decentralized the assets it is able to incorporate as collateral for loans that generate DAI.      The community was tested in early 2020 when a sharp downturn in ETH prices left the overall protocol several million dollars undercollateralized. In a controversial move, it subsequently incorporated the fiat-backed stablecoin from Circle and Coinbase, USDC. MKR holders have subsequently added many more crypto assets to the mix, under the theory that the more assets it can incorporate the less the collapse of prices in any one can threaten the project.      Christensen's ultimate vision has always been to include real-world assets as collateral.      In March of this year MakerDAO created the Core Units framework, essentially committees that would take the lead in key aspects of running the protocol; that is, they do the work the Foundation once took on. This very much squares with what Christensen described to CoinDesk as ""DAO teams"" in 2019.

The fund is called the Viridi Cleaner Energy Crypto-Mining & Semiconductor ETF and will trade on the New York Stock Exchange’s Arca platform; Viridi will serve as a sub-adviser to the fund while Alpha Architect is creating the fund’s infrastructure. The management fee on the ETF will be 0.9%, higher than most ETFs but lower than most closed crypto funds.      Eighty percent of the fund will invest in publicly traded miners that have switched to nuclear or renewable sources of energy or are trying to offset their carbon emissions with carbon credits, while 20% is going towards semiconductors that also take advantage of clean energy.

42387283,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBmOR7,1626792430,Blockchain or Blockbuster? The Choice Facing Financial Incumbents,"Looking back at industries that have been disrupted by the introduction of new technology – media, e-commerce, travel – the transformation has affected virtually every aspect of that industry, from consumer behavior to infrastructure. We are in the midst of seeing this transformation occur with the introduction of blockchain technology to financial services. While most media coverage has focused on digital assets themselves, institutional infrastructure and financial intermediaries are being scrutinized and uprooted.      Traditional securities exchanges and intermediaries have played a pivotal role in financial markets for over a century, facilitating the buying and selling of investment products. But as we move towards a decentralized and distributed ecosystem where access and peer-to-peer transference of financial products is effortless, intermediaries know they need to evolve to keep up with the innovation happening in digital assets.    Jerald David is President at Arca Labs, where he leads the innovation division responsible for creating registered digital securities and tokenized funds in partnership with financial companies. He has over 17 years of executive team experience for both Fortune 500 and startup exchanges including CME, NYMEX, GreenX, and the Dubai Mercantile Exchange.    Just as centralized digital exchanges replaced the chaotic days on the New York Stock Exchange trading floor filled with adrenaline fueled traders and tickets flying through the air, exchanges and intermediaries once again have to transform to support a blockchain-based financial future. The financial services industry is filled with incumbents that are already feeling the pressure as digital assets and blockchain startups remove intermediaries through a trustless system. But they need to show more urgency and increase the pace of innovation.      Digital assets are among the most scrutinized asset classes to date, most likely because they have the potential to cause the greatest transformation and change evokes fear. While reluctance and angst may have slowed adoption, we are now seeing passive involvement from the incumbents, in the form of private investments, to remain relevant in the digitally powered financial future.    How governments are addressing digital assets    Stablecoins, most popularly backed 1-to-1 with a fiat currency, were born to provide a low-volatility digital asset to escape heavy price fluctuation, at least temporarily, but remain in digital form. They’ve now become a crucial backbone to the digital asset ecosystem while also serving as an on-ramp from fiat into digital assets. With the explosion of stablecoins, central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, have been exploring their own version of a stablecoin, or rather a CBDC (central bank digital currency). Governments, and associations like the Bank of International Settlements, are hoping that CBDCs will make unregulated stablecoins like USDT, USDC and PAX obsolete, arguing that CBDCs protect against the “twin evils"" of Big Tech and bitcoin to preserve the core features of money.      However, as the Federal Reserve begins its exploration of CBDCs, digital asset companies and Silicon Valley will continue to innovate and push the boundaries of payments and investments. The question becomes, will governments be able to create policies and regulations to launch a CBDC to keep up with innovation, or will the digital asset ecosystem mature to a point where CBDCs no longer fit? If it’s the latter, will the U.S. government follow in China’s footsteps and crack down on digital assets to maintain control over financial activities?    What incumbents are doing    Financial incumbents are also slow to keep up with the pace of innovation and change within the digital asset ecosystem, as we’ve seen throughout the rise of digital assets over the past 13 years. The unfortunate trend has been for legacy firms to criticize the new technology until it has been proven successful, and then jump on the bandwagon (as we saw with non-fungible tokens, or NFT).      While the digital asset ecosystem is being built independently from the current financial system, its success is dependent on adoption from incumbents to further its growth. Conversely, financial incumbents need to embrace digital assets’ innovative technology to stay relevant to their customers.      Traditional finance has been telling the digital asset ecosystem for a decade that it cannot simply jump into the new asset class; it needs finessed systems that bridge the traditional and modern practices to migrate effectively and efficiently. The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), a staple in traditional finance post-trade processes, has announced a blockchain infrastructure prototype named Project Whitney to support the tokenization of assets throughout their lifecycle – issuance, distribution, and secondary transfer. The DTCC announced the project in May 2020 but only recently, in July 2021, appointed a Head of Strategy and Business Development to run it. The DTCC, whose depository provides custody and asset servicing for securities issues from 170 countries and territories valued at $63 trillion, cannot be as nimble as a startup, but will the DTCC’s ultimate digital transformation be expeditious and robust enough to compete in the digital asset marketplace?    Hybrid approach    While established financial incumbents are taking a slow and methodical approach, we are witnessing differing methods of how companies are linking the infrastructure found in the traditional financial world with digital assets. The recent Nasdaq-listed digital asset exchange, Coinbase, along with Gemini and Binance.US, are all centralized exchanges. They still require users to conform to many of the traditional financial processes, including know your customer/anti-money laundering (KYC/AML). They also replicate the “off-chain” matching function of an exchange that investors are familiar with, i.e., NYSE and Nasdaq, but list an entirely new asset class.      These digital asset exchanges straddle both worlds, acting similar to their traditional counterparts by charging fees for exchange services, custodying user funds, and deciding which digital assets to list. Coinbase and its peers reap the benefits of a centralized model while functioning without the limitations imposed upon the traditional exchanges – 24/7/365 access, scalability to multiple jurisdictions, permissioned blockchain transparency, and preservation of security and privacy.      However, straddling both traditional and digital worlds comes with its challenges. Often these centralized exchanges run into liquidity challenges due to blockchain’s enablement of instant settlement, which in turn, requires trades to be pre-funded on an unsecured basis. Digital asset exchanges also realize substantial price and volume risk as a result of the unstable pricing feeds and lack of fungibility between exchanges. While these companies are trying to find a delicate balance, it seems that attempting to satisfy the old with the new is a short term solution.    The future    The blockchain community's trustless mantra is pushing forward with fully decentralized marketplaces using liquidity protocols and swaps to deploy asset pricing and trade execution, eliminating the need for any third parties. SushiSwap, Uniswap and Polkadot are examples of this next generation trading structure that allows users to trade and earn a portion of the platform transaction fees by staking or lending digital currencies to the exchange – effectively earning yields on their digital assets.      While decentralized exchanges (DEX) remove the need for central authorities that control who and what users trade, there are noteworthy disadvantages, including cybersecurity issues, KYC/AML absence and the limitation of only crypto-to-crypto trading. Currently, the concept of fully decentralized exchanges seems foreign and a future utopia for mainstream institutional acceptance; however, if nothing else, this new ecosystem has proven that competent technology applied thoughtfully has the potential to be far more powerful than what we can even imagine.      No matter how long incumbents box out DEXs, all the transitional steps towards reducing intermediaries and cost, market transparency, and faster settlement are positive transformations that can not be ignored for long. The latest Coinbase outage further drives the business case for fully decentralized exchanges that eradicate single points of failure.      Blockchain technology and its community has taught us that thinking bigger gets you further. The question remains, will the slow and methodical approach of incumbents prevail or will startups’ fast lane attack declare victory? We are in the middle of a technology revolution and players need to keep up or risk being taken out.      UPDATE (July 21, 19:45 UTC): This post has been updated to show that DTCC's new Head of Strategy and Business Development, Jennifer Peve, was appointed from within the company, where she has worked since 2015.

42387276,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBmOM5,1626792145,Silvergate Took $4.3B in Deposits From Digital Currency Customers in Q2,"Silvergate Bank accepted a whopping $4.3 billion in new deposits from new and existing digital currency customers in second-quarter 2021, according to an earnings report released Tuesday.      Most came from crypto exchanges, which deposited $2.4 billion in cash during the quarter. Institutional investor deposits grew by $1.8 billion and those from other customers by $100 million. The La Jolla, Calif.-based bank, which serves major crypto firms such as Coinbase, Gemini and Kraken, added 120 digital currency customers for a total of 1,224.      Crypto firms are often a rich source of low-cost deposits for the few banks that openly serve the sector. Silvergate’s average cost of deposits was 0% in the three months through June, compared with 0.37% in the year-earlier quarter. For scale, average deposit costs for mid-cap commercial banks are normally around 0.75% to 1.25%.    See also: Goldman Sachs Starts Coverage of Silvergate Capital With Neutral Rating    The Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN), a fiat on-ramp for bitcoin markets, processed 137,947 transactions and transferred $239.6 billion over the network during the last quarter.      In its earnings call on Tuesday, the bank provided investors with an update on how it was monetizing the deposits that are being held with Silvergate because of its exchange network.      “In the second quarter, average deposits from digital currency customers grew by $3.5 billion to $9.9 billion,” Silvergate CEO Alan Lane said. “Driven by the record volume we experienced on this, we are prudently deploying these deposits into interest earning assets, including the purchase of $4.5 billion of both short and long duration securities during the quarter.”      Adding deposits to the bank’s balance sheet makes it harder to maintain high capital reserve ratios, and the bank’s stock analysts have pushed it to do more with the deposits it has. The bank’s Tier 1 leverage ratio – which measures equity capital against risk-weighted assets – remained well above the regulatory threshold of 5% at 7.9% this quarter but under the 9.68% level it was at in the first quarter of this year.      Lane also addressed the deposit growth that would come from being the exclusive stablecoin issuer for Facebook’s Diem project.      “We are looking at our capital needs and anticipated growth to be capital efficient and having runway to support that growth,” Lane said. “We’re also looking at off balance sheet mechanisms to take on that growth that might come from a stablecoin project like Diem.”      The international expansion of Diem will depend on how well the bank can enable Diem redemptions in other jurisdictions, said Silvergate EVP of Corporate Development Ben Reynolds. The project will need banks or money services businesses that can move dollars from the blockchain and convert them into local native currencies, he added.      “We’re pretty excited about the work that we’ve been doing in foreign exchange,” Reynolds said. “Over the last couple of years, setting up those relationships with like-minded banks around the globe.”      Silvergate plans to profit off of the transaction fees on minting and burning Diem’s stablecoin, yield on the reserve deposits from Diem, and on offering traditional banking services to customers that come to the bank through Diem. This past quarter, Silvergate raked in $11.3 million in fees from digital currency customers, up 59% from the previous quarter.      The bank saw approved credit lines that totaled $258.5 million in its bitcoin-backed loans product called SEN Leverage (which functions like margin lending for institutional investors). The bank is still seeing growth in that product, but it’s been slower in the latest bitcoin downturn, Lane added.      Lane said that the bank has “entertained” offering SEN Leverage loans to customers outside of its institutional investor base but added that the bank has chosen not to because it doesn’t want to get trapped into “one-off loans.”      “We certainly are open to other opportunities,” Reynolds said. “For example, if treasuries start adopting bitcoin on the balance sheet more, then the need for financing could grow, and that would be something that we would consider.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/07/20/silvergate-took-43b-in-deposits-from-digital-currency-customers-in-q2,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3896ee7d0f100ad863524781dc363b0d33add388-1500x851.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42387280,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBmOSN,1626788480,Circle Reveals Assets Backing USDC Stablecoin,"The majority of Circle’s USDC stablecoin is backed by U.S. dollars, the company revealed on Tuesday.      Circle, a global payments company, was one of USDC's creators. It published a breakdown of its assets backing the stablecoin for the first time in its latest attestation report, which was dated July 16. According to the report, about 61% of its tokens are backed by “cash and cash equivalents,” meaning cash and money market funds.      Yankee Certificates of Deposit – meaning CDs issued by foreign (non-U.S.) banks – comprise a further 13%, U.S. Treasuries account for 12%, commercial paper accounts for 9%, and the remaining tokens are backed by municipal and corporate bonds.      The company has issued about $22.2 billion worth of USDC, according to the attestation.      It’s unclear what, specifically, Circle has invested in to back USDC. The company intends to go public later this year in a merger with a special purpose acquisition company that would value Circle at $4.5 billion.      According to footnotes in Tuesday’s attestation, the commercial paper has a “minimum S&P rating of S/T A1,” meaning S&P Global Ratings regards the issuer’s ability to meet its financial obligations as being strong.      Circle joins Tether in publishing a rough breakdown of its asset reserves, at least partially answering questions about whether its stablecoin is fully backed. Like Circle, Tether also uses commercial paper to back its USDT token, though commercial paper accounts for far more of Tether’s reserves than Circle’s does.

42387291,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBmOex,1626787800,State of Crypto: Stablecoin Rules Are Coming,"The top financial regulators in the U.S. met to discuss stablecoins yesterday. We’re not sure yet what sort of regulations we might see, but this conversation is clearly only just starting.    You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Stablecoins are spooky  The narrative    Everyone in crypto seems to be talking about stablecoins these days – and regulators are no exception. We’re going to see even more conversation about them in the coming weeks, though it’s far too early to tell what any sort of concrete regulation might look like.    Why it matters    Regulators within the U.S. and worldwide are looking at stablecoins and debating possible rules for this type of cryptocurrency. How these regulations ultimately unfold could determine the transparency issuers must provide and the rights of customers. Possible regulations could also mitigate the threat that stablecoins pose a systemic risk to the financial system – or they could just make the situation worse.    Breaking it down    Yesterday, the President’s Working Group for Financial Markets convened to discuss stablecoins, marking the first publicly-announced meeting of this group of regulators since Joe Biden took office earlier this year.      The meeting is the latest move in an escalating level of attention on stablecoins.      A notice announcing the meeting promised that the group, which includes Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, Acting Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chair Rostin Behnam, Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael Hsu and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chair Jelena McWilliams among others, would publish recommendations for stablecoin regulation within the next few months.      This is at least the second meeting of this group to discuss stablecoins: the PWG also published some suggestions under former President Donald Trump’s administration.      What isn’t clear is what sort of regulatory framework would make the most sense for stablecoins. Gary Gorton and Jeffrey Zhang, a Yale economist and Federal Reserve attorney respectively, suggested bank regulations and mandatory FDIC insurance, echoing a framework first proposed last year by Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.).      Others have advocated for a securities-focused framework where stablecoins – or at least stablecoins backed by multiple assets – are regulated as securities.      Stablecoin regulation might also depend heavily on the specific asset. Rep. Warren Davidson (R-Ohio), one of crypto’s loudest advocates on Capitol Hill, said that in his view, not all stablecoins should be treated as securities, but stablecoins that specifically are backed by securities should fall under the same sort of regulatory regime.      “I think you could easily craft a stablecoin that meets a test that says ‘no, this is not a security,’” he said. “But on the other side, if you've got a stablecoin that is essentially backed by securities, it gets hard to say that it's not a security.”      Libra – the original version of the Diem stablecoin project – used to be the go-to for regulatory bodies in describing what a stablecoin that looks like a security might be. Other stablecoins might also start to resemble regulated products.      “A lot of people have said after Tether’s disclosure that ‘wow this looks a lot like a money market fund,’” Davidson said.      Congress has held two hearings in recent weeks where stablecoins have come up. In a June 30 hearing on crypto market volatility this year, one of the witnesses, Americans for Financial Reform Senior Policy Analyst Alexis Goldstein, said it’s “urgent” that regulators look into stablecoins.      Part of regulators’ goal should be to ensure that stablecoins are actually backed by the assets they’re supposed to have, she said.      “I don't think it's unreasonable to want to ensure that something that pretends to be pegged to one U.S. dollar actually isn't capable of breaking the buck and people losing their funds,” she said.      Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell noted the risk may come from commercial paper backing stablecoins, such as tether, as during a financial crisis the market might dry up, making it difficult to redeem.    Binance redux    Last week’s newsletter was largely about Binance. Since then, Italy’s federal financial regulator and Lithuania’s central bank have said the exchange cannot provide investment services within their borders.      Binance also shuttered its stock token service the same day Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission announced it was concerned about such tokens being offered to its residents. Plus, Binance Brazil’s new director left the job after about six months, citing “a misalignment of expectations.”      It’s not yet clear to me what the endgame here will look like. It does seem more likely that we’re seeing all of these warnings and actions because one or two regulators made a first move and others followed, rather than due to any sort of globally coordinated effort. This makes it more difficult to guess what or when the next warning from a regulator will drop.      It also means that Binance and its executives may well be the only entities fully aware of just what regulators are looking at. Binance’s own actions will also be an important signal of any further warnings or enforcement actions.      “A new chapter awaits us, as we embrace compliance and regulations,” Binance CEO CZ tweeted on Sunday.    Bitcoin ETFs    It’s been a minute since I’ve talked about bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications and I want to revisit the topic more in-depth at some point but right now I want to take a moment to just look at where we are.      Since VanEck first proposed its latest attempt for a bitcoin ETF in December 2020, over 10 different firms have published over a dozen different applications.      Over the past week, the SEC has:    Formally instituted proceedings to examine whether or not it should approve the WisdomTree ETF application.  Delayed making any initial decision on the Wise Origin bitcoin ETF application (this is the one linked to Fidelity).  Delayed making any initial decision on the First Trust SkyBridge bitcoin ETF application.  Published the NYDIG bitcoin ETF application for the first time.    All told, the SEC is actively evaluating seven of the applications sitting before it. The remaining applications include two ether ETF filings and one bitcoin futures application, in addition to the bitcoin filings.      It’s still unclear whether a bitcoin ETF will actually be approved this year. The person to watch continues to be Chair Gary Gensler.    Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard    So, revisiting the idea of stablecoin regulations: That column on the right is the group of people to watch. It doesn’t seem like we’ll see nominations for roles currently filled by acting heads, so this is the list.    Elsewhere:  Republican Senator Highlights Bitcoin’s Battle in Shedding Criminal Baggage: U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) wrote an open letter which said bitcoin supports $76 billion in “illegal” drug-related transactions every year, adding, “What makes cryptocurrency dangerous is that users have the ability to remain anonymous.” My colleague Danny Nelson took a look at these claims and confirmed that actual data presents a somewhat different narrative.

El Salvador May Issue Its Own Stablecoin: Report: El Salvador President Nayib Bukele’s brothers met with representatives from Cardano, Algorand and WhizGrid to discuss building a native Salvadoran stablecoin to add to its list of currencies accepted as legal tender.  Outside CoinDesk:  (Decrypt) I assume we all saw the headlines earlier this month about how Greenidge Generation, a natural gas fuel generation facility, was affecting Seneca Lake and turning its waters into “a hot tub.” This excellent report by Decrypt writer Scott Chipolina analyzes how it’s more likely that a nearby outlet that feeds the lake is actually getting warmer – and this is likely to have downstream effects on the local environment.  (The New York Times) Ransomware group REvil has apparently disappeared, just days after its malware was used against IT solutions firm Kaseya. No government has taken responsibility for this, and I’m told it seems unlikely it was a U.S. government action as REvil’s DNS records have not changed. It’s more likely that the group is either rebranding or taking a break.  (Rolling Stone) If you’re wondering how the non-crypto world looked at the Bitcoin 2021 conference in Miami last month, this Rolling Stone profile is an amusing place to start.

The Brooklyn, N.Y.-based CoinFund’s third fund, “Ventures,” is focused on “early mainstream adoption” projects, CEO Jake Brukhman told CoinDesk Monday.      Where the firm’s previous fund was largely focused on non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized finance (DeFi), Brukhman said the new fund’s portfolio includes go-to-market consumer and enterprise plays, plus Web 2 developers building in the crypto space.      “Just in the first six months of this year, we are leading or co-leading seven opportunities in blockchain,” Brukhman said.

The tool will allow Solana developers to access and verify blockchain data, write transactions and build applications and services that will help expand Solana's network, which is now among the 20 or so supported by the “Query & Transact” product.      In January, Coinbase, a publicly listed crypto exchange, purchased Bison Trails, which now operates as a standalone product line. Its Query & Transact node infrastructure is used by crypto exchanges, wallets, Web 3 developers and machine-learning companies to process data.      “Even for highly technical teams, running read/write infrastructure is challenging and time-consuming,” Bison Trails CEO Joe Lallouz said in a statement. “With Solana Query & Transact, enterprises and developers interested in building products and services on Solana have a powerful new solution.”      According to Anatoly Yakovenko, president of the Solana Foundation, the partnership between Bison Trails and Solana goes back to Solana’s testnet. Yakovenko said the integration will provide a scalable product for developers of Solana's decentralized app (dapp).

The eastern European country's government has partnered with Norway-based blockchain trading platform WiV Technology in a bid to bring the country's wine to a wider audience and enhance its reputation, according to an emailed announcement Tuesday.      Under the partnership, NFTs for the wine and its provenance will be minted and made available on WiV's blockchain-based trading platform. WiV is also helping Georgia's National Wine Agency develop a quality-assurance standard similar to the ""Denominazione di origine controllata"" (Designation of Controlled Origin) model used in Italy since 1963.      New draft legislation in Georgia requiring certification for all wine has just been passed in parliament. ""This can all be put on blockchain and all wineries and producers are obliged to pay for it, which gives it a great advantage,"" WiV CEO Tommy Jensen told CoinDesk.      The process of trading physical assets more quickly and efficiently as digital representations ""works exceptionally well for wine because tokens can confirm the wine's provenance,"" Georgia President Salome Zourabichvili said in a statement.

42387287,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBmOZv,1626786000,Rolexes in DeFi? NFT Marketplace 4K Raises $3M to Combine NFTs and Luxury Goods,"4K, a novel marketplace that issues non-fungible tokens (NFTs) paired with luxury items held in storage, has raised $3 million in a seed round of funding that was led by Electric Capital, Crosscut Ventures, Collab+Currency, ConsenSys and IDEO CoLab Ventures.      Testing of the 4K platform also kicks off Tuesday, as the company aims to issue digital deeds to luxury items such as Rolex watches and rare sneakers. Those deeds can be used to earn yield within the burgeoning decentralized finance (DeFi) realm, the startup said.      Bringing real-world assets into DeFi is viewed as a highly lucrative addition to the world of crypto lending. DeFi refers to finance that is based on blockchain technology and that doesn't rely on a central intermediary such as a bank.      With 4K, customers send a physical item to be authenticated and stored in a secure storage facility. Once an item is stored, the customer receives an NFT, which has the potential earn interest, 4K CEO Richard Li says. If a customer sends the NFT to 4K, the physical item is sent to the address provided by the redeemer.    Read more: MakerDAO Weighs Accepting Real-World Assets as Crypto Loan Collateral    NFTs come in three flavors, Li said – digital art, digital items from virtual reality platforms, known as ""the metaverse,"" and digital property rights, which is the part 4K is interested in.      The platform is hoping to attract crypto-curious sneakerheads, watch aficionados, wine connoisseurs, trading card experts or collectors of any other investment-grade physical goods.      “If you bring physical aspects into crypto, which is purely digital right now, that introduces an entirely new asset class and dynamic to the ecosystem,” Li said in an interview.      “We can NFT anything and bring it into the digital world,"" he added. ""Imagine an NFT of a real-life horse and bringing it into [digital horse racing platform] ZED RUN; or if you NFT’d a Michael Jordan rookie card and brought it into NBA Top Shot.”      By the same token, how might someone with a million-dollar Rolex collection go about getting a loan against it? “Do I go to a pawn shop?” Li said.      In terms of storing customers’ valuables, Li said 4K will be using independent auditors and high-security vaults based in the U.S. to begin with. Everything will be 100% insured, he said.

It’s a little early for Uniswap, Li said, pointing to next-generation NFT platforms like NFTX, NFTfi and Taker. Uniswap is an exchange where customers can trade digital tokens.      “It’s going to be very interesting when you start getting yield on your digital NFTs and physical items.

South Korea's central bank has picked Ground X, a blockchain subsidiary of South Korea-based internet giant Kakao, the Korea Herald reported Tuesday.  The deal is planned to be closed by the end of July with the pilot program commencing next month.  It was reported in May that the BOK was seeking a technology supplier through an open bidding process, with the plan for simulations researching the practicalities of a CBDC involving banks and retailers to run from August to December.  The BOK has said the pilot program was allocated for 4.9 billion won ($4.4 million), according to the Korea Herald's report.  Ground X launched its own blockchain Klaytn in 2018, on which it stores and verifies unlisted investments as non-fungible tokens as of February this year.  Seoul-based Shinhan bank announced in March it had built a blockchain-based platform for a potential South Korean CBDC. Shinhan last month joined Klaytn's governance council to partake in the platform’s blockchain operation and develop a number of Klaytn-based digital services for South Korea’s fintech ecosystem.  The central banks of almost all major economies have shown an interest in investigating or developing a CBDC in recent years, with China's digital yuan (or E-CNY) the closest to fruition.

42387288,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBmOcR,1626782400,Europe and UK Binance Users React to Recent Restrictions Placed on Exchange,"On Thursday, Italy’s financial authority joined a growing list of regulators warning the cryptocurrency exchange Binance is not authorized to provide investment services in the country.      Filippo Cappella, a 25-year-old full-time crypto investor based in Italy. had been using Binance for some time, certain it was safe and regulated. But since Thursday’s warning he’s not sure he wants to keep using the platform.      “I read the news, and it’s not that great ... [N]ow I’m thinking of moving my funds out of Binance,” Cappella said.      Binance, one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world, is facing heat from a number of regulators across the globe from the Cayman Islands to Thailand, with much of the scrutiny and restrictions concentrated in Europe and the U.K. The platform announced Friday that it will end support for tokens linked to stocks effective immediately. Some crypto investors based in the U.K. and Europe, like Cappella, are frustrated with the recent developments with Binance, but don’t feel they will have a lasting impact on the future of crypto in the region.      For instance, Llovonne Norfolk-St George, a U.K.-based swimming teacher turned crypto day trader, says she has not been able to deposit any funds to Binance since June 28.      After the U.K’s Financial Conduct Authority warned on June 26 that Binance’s global affiliate, Binance Markets Ltd., isn’t authorized to operate in the country, British banks Barclays, Santander and Clear Junction suspended payments to the crypto platform, while Nationwide said it is reviewing its policy on cryptocurrencies to help protect customers. Meanwhile, the European Union’s Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) appeared to have also blocked payments to Binance.      Binance is also shut off from the U.K.’s Faster Payments network.      “As a U.K. banking client, the [effect] of SEPA’s decision to prevent investors from moving money out of the banks and into [Binance] has absolutely cost me hundreds, if not thousands, of pounds in investment,” Norfolk-St George said, adding that it prevented her from topping up her account and taking advantage of the recent price fluctuations in crypto markets.      In April, Norfolk-St George transferred all of her crypto investments to the Binance platform, including a new investment of £20,000 (around US$28,000).      On July 1, Binance released a statement clarifying that Binance Markets Ltd. was a separate legal entity from www.binance.com.      “The FCA Notice does not apply to the products and services provided through www.binance.com, nor does it change any arrangement with our users,” the statement said.      But a couple of days prior to publishing the statement, Binance U.K. users said that pound sterling deposits and withdrawals had been blocked by the exchange, although services were quickly reinstated.      A few days later, Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao published an open letter, stating that compliance is a journey. By July 13, however, the platform had once again suspended withdrawals.      Chris Peake, a small crypto investor based in North West England, said that although he admires Zhao, he has removed all his funds from Binance until further clarity is provided to investors on where things stand.      “I will warn everyone from using the exchange,” Peake said on Twitter.      Meanwhile, Cappella tried to make a money transfer to Binance via SEPA on Thursday, but the crypto platform said it was unable to process the payment because of maintenance issues.      “Binance was saying it was maintenance but it was clearly not ... Binance is acting a bit weird regarding this,” Cappella said.    Nothing to worry about    A crypto influencer known only as “Andy,” who runs a popular YouTube channel on crypto investment called Operation Crypto and is a community director at Learning: Crypto U.K., is a Binance user, but he isn’t that concerned about the recent developments.      “The main issues I’ve seen are a handful of U.K. banks stopping incoming/outgoing payments to Binance,” Andy said via a direct message on Twitter, adding that there are plenty of other ways to purchase or invest in cryptocurrencies. “I think personally that regulation is required for us to head towards mass adoption.”      Cappella thinks that the crackdown on Binance could give a huge boost to its more compliance-friendly rivals like Kraken and Coinbase, but that he has little faith in centralized exchanges in general.    ""It’s not Binance""    Norfolk-St George feels the recent restrictions on Binance in the U.K. say more about banks and traditional financial institutions than they do about crypto exchanges.      “It’s not Binance that has restricted my money, it’s the action of my fiat banks and their partner companies,” she said.      She called the quick and successive moves by financial institutions to block Binance “the action of the ‘scared’” and a “defeatist move,” likening the events to that of 2012 when Europe rose against the secretly negotiated international treaty Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) that could have led to internet censorship.      “Crypto isn’t going anywhere and neither is Binance,” Norfolk-St George said.      Despite Cappella’s intentions to move his funds out of Binance, he doesn’t feel restrictions on one exchange by one country can have a lasting effect on the crypto industry at large.      “That's a reason why crypto has become so successful and so resilient. Decentralization doesn't care if one country bans it, because it just means another country right next to it is gonna say, ‘Come to us to do business with crypto,’” Cappella said.      Both Cappella and Norfolk-St George are watching out for developments regarding Binance, but beyond the immediate concerns about their funds, they see the overall future of crypto as bright.      “My folks, they used to pay for their goods with either cash or check. I live in a world where I only either use my card or my phone, why would it be hard to believe that my son will be paying in crypto?” Norfolk-St George said.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | BNB,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/07/20/europe-and-uk-binance-users-react-to-recent-restrictions-placed-on-exchange,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/25000354d1cfe3118825d4c9be81febec88b66d6-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406990,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8lIb,1626781981,Ether Falls Toward $1.7K as Bitcoin's Price Drop Weighs on Broader Market,"Ether and other alternative cryptocurrencies, popularly known as altcoins, are taking a hit alongside bitcoin as the dour macro mood overshadows bullish idiosyncratic narratives.      The native token of Ethereum's blockchain is trading near $1,758 at press time, down 6% on a 24-hour basis. The cryptocurrency touched a three-week low of $1,721 early today, having peaked above $4,000 in May, according to CoinDesk 20 data. Other prominent altcoins like XRP, cardano, uniswap, chainlink, and stellar are nursing declines around 10%. Bitcoin, the crypto market leader, is down 5% at $29,700.      ""We're seeing risk-off moves in equity, FX and commodities,"" said Edmond G., head of trading at B2C2. ""Crypto isn't immune from traditional market sentiment and is also caught up in the legs lower. So far, we're seeing very little movement [higher in ETH] while heading into the Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIP) 1559 upgrade proposed [for] Aug. 4.""      Global equity markets faced selling pressure on Monday, while the dollar rose on concerns a rebound in coronavirus cases would derail the global economy. As a result, bitcoin and crypto, being at the far end of the risk curve, are suffering losses.      According to some analysts, Ethereum's impending upgrade aims to burn part of the transaction fees and make ether less inflationary.      ""The ether supply burn would be significant even with the growth of the layer 2 scaling solutions,"" Noelle Acheson, head of markets insights at CoinDesk sister company Genesis Trading, said. "" Whatever amount ends up being burned, it will be more than what's currently being burned, so the upgrade does reduce the supply growth.""      Acheson said that while the upgrade wouldn't directly reduce ether transaction fees, a sour spot for DeFi protocols and traders, it will ""make them more transparent and manageable.""      However, Delta Exchange CEO Pankaj Balani said markets priced in the bullish EIP narrative earlier this year.      Ether nearly doubled to $4,000 in the four weeks to mid-May even as bitcoin traded between $50,000 and $60,000. Ether's decoupling was mainly powered by the optimism surrounding the EIP upgrade.      ""Crypto markets are now in a slow grind lower and vulnerable to negative macro news,"" Balani said in a WhatsApp call. ""Ether and other altcoins will see a bloodbath if bitcoin slides toward $20,000.""      The probability of bitcoin falling that low and nuking the broader market has increased, with the cryptocurrency looking to establish a foothold under $30,000. ""When a price dumps and stays flatlined at the lows, forming a ledge,"" that says the market is doomed, according to trader and analyst Alex Kruger. ""You can see that in most charts in the past 24 hours.""      According to Patrick Heusser, head of trading at Crypto Finance, $29,000 and $1,700 are crucial supports for bitcoin and ether, respectively. ""How low can it go? Probably down to $20K,"" he said. ""If you look at the liquidity pool structure, there was not much trading on the way up, except a bit around $23,000.""      Ether could run into stronger selling pressure, as blockchain data shows an increased flow of coins onto exchanges. ""We are seeing lending platforms like BlockFi sending large amounts of ETH to Coinbase, possibly to liquidate,"" Alex Svanevik, CEO of blockchain data company Nansen, said.      The only positive news for crypto bulls is that the market is seeing low volumes while grinding lower. ""It potentially signals that sellers are exhausted and that the market is waiting for some positive news,"" Heusser said.      Further, equity markets are showing signs of stability at press time. The European markets are trading higher, and the futures tied to the S&P 500 are pointing to a positive open with a 0.60% gain. ""It could be a bounce time for crypto, as equity market panic looks to be over,"" Kruger said. ""It makes sense to move stop loses on bitcoin shorts higher to $31,000.""

42406986,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8lFe,1626778800,Mastercard to Test USDC for Payments as Stablecoin Scrutiny Intensifies,"Mastercard has named the first stablecoin and a handful of partner companies that will help cryptocurrency holders spend their digital assets at merchants that accept the payment giant’s cards.      In the pilot announced Tuesday, Circle’s USDC will serve as a bridge between the cryptocurrency in consumers’ digital wallets and the fiat currency paid to merchants. USDC is a digital token that almost always trades at $1 because the issuer promises to redeem it 1-for-1 with greenbacks at any time.      While it might sound like adding an extra step, swapping a cryptocurrency for a stablecoin and then exchanging the stablecoin for dollars can be quicker or simpler than going directly from crypto to fiat. For example, some cryptos cannot be easily traded on an exchange for dollars but can be for USDC. Adding this way station will assist cryptocurrency firms that want to offer Mastercard-branded products to their customers, the company said.      “Today not all crypto companies have the foundational infrastructure to convert cryptocurrency to traditional fiat currency, and we’re making it easier,” said Raj Dhamodharan, Mastercard’s executive vice president of digital asset and blockchain products, in a press release.      The announcement, five months after Mastercard said it planned to bring select stablecoins into its network, was framed as a step toward that eventual goal.      The plan comes as stablecoins face growing scrutiny among regulators and lawmakers. On Monday the U.S. President's Working Group for Financial Markets promised to publish recommendations for stablecoin regulations in the coming months, after the top federal financial regulators discussed use cases and potential risks.      This followed remarks from Federal Reserve officials signaling various levels of concern over the past few months, with Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren in particular singling out Tether’s USDT stablecoin, the market leader, as a potential “challenge” to financial stability.      Asked how Mastercard is verifying that stablecoins settled through the program are fully backed by reserves, Mastercard spokesperson Katie Priebe referred CoinDesk to the foundational principles the company outlined in February.      Payment companies are continuing to trial stablecoins like USDC for transactions. Visa announced it had conducted a small USDC transaction earlier this year.    Work in progress    Aside from Circle, Evolve Bank & Trust and Paxos Trust Co. are involved in the pilot, though their roles are not clear. Mastercard said it is “in discussions” with Evolve and Metropolitan Commercial Bank to issue crypto cards. While Paxos has its own collateralized stablecoin, Paxos standard, Priebe said that for now, USDC is the only stablecoin involved.      “While the final choice of stablecoin is left to the issuer and the wallet provider, the stablecoin must conform to our foundational principles on stablecoin enablement,” she said.      The company is also in talks with long-running crypto startups Uphold and BitPay to provide digital wallet technology and with three firms from the traditional card business to handle back-end functions, Mastercard said.      Priebe said the pilot should go live soon, though a specific date has yet to be determined.      The growing scrutiny of stablecoins reflects in part their torrid growth: Circle’s USDC has jumped sixfold since the beginning of the year, growing from around $4 billion on Jan. 1 to over $25 billion as of press time, according to CoinGecko. Paxos standard, while down from its peak market capitalization of $1.4 billion in May, has nonetheless grown as well over that same time period.

The company also said it will offer its first bitcoin-backed loans either this month or early next month.      The deposits by digital asset customers comprised more than half of the $11.6 billion increase in total deposits at the bank in Q2. The figure compares with growth of $4.4 billion in the first quarter 2021.      ""It's stablecoin reserves, it's OTC desks and institutional traders, digital asset exchanges and blockchain technology and digital miners,"" said Signature Bank CEO Joe DePaolo.      Of the $6.3 billion in Q2 deposits from digital asset customers, $3.4 billion were made by digital asset exchanges, $1.9 billion were stablecoin reserves, $600 million were assets deposited by OTC desks and institutional traders and about $300 million “give or take” by blockchain technology and digital miners, DePaolo said.      Signature currently banks five stablecoin issuers, four of which have their money in non-interesting bearing accounts and one of which has its funds in interest-bearing accounts. The bank nearly doubled its non-interest-bearing accounts to $6.14 billion in Q2. While its rival Silvergate Bank reported Tuesday it had approved extended credit lines of up to $258.5 million for its bitcoin-backed loans product, Signature will extend its first bitcoin-backed loan at the end of July or beginning of August, DePaolo said.

The NFT platform was valued at $1.5 billion after a $100 million Series B that closed Tuesday, executives told CoinDesk Tuesday. Silicon Valley’s best-known VC, Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) once again led the financing round; it headlined OpenSea’s $23 million Series A in March.      Only a handful of crypto startups have become unicorns and OpenSea is perhaps the only to do it, in part, by selling digital pictures of them: A particularly anxious-looking yellow one standing beside a steaming volcano was listed for 0.4 ETH ($703.93) on Monday.      That’s four times more than its March sale price, during the height of an NFT mania driven by crypto-rich investors and million-dollar NFT sales. The $2.5 billion industry has since cooled amid a wider crypto sell-off – at least according to the popular narrative.      But OpenSea’s trading activity has endured and even grown. Its NFT marketplace, which takes a 2.5% cut, posted a record $160 million in digital asset sales in June.

Cross-chain marketplace    OpenSea plans to support NFT sales from networks like Flow and Tezos in addition to Ethereum, the medium’s historical hub.      The move is a compromise for economics and accessibility, said Finzer. Transactions on Ethereum are just too pricey for casual users. He said other blockchains better support low-value, high-volume projects like event ticketing or gameplay that OpenSea plans to court.      There’s still a market for minting “high-value artwork” minted on Ethereum, Finzer said.

BlockFi CEO Zac Prince confirmed his company had received the order late Monday.  Prince said BlockFi remains ""fully operational"" for its existing clients in New Jersey and that all aspects of the platform continue to be accessible for its clients in the state.  CoinDesk contacted Prince, who declined to comment further.  The acting AG's order requests BlockFi to stop accepting new BIA clients residing in New Jersey beginning July 22, 2021, Prince confirmed in a tweet.  ""We will continue to engage with all relevant authorities to protect our clients’ interests and ensure that our products remain available,"" said Prince.  Having just started the job on Monday, Acting Attorney General Andrew Bruck appears to be setting the tone of his new role.  The order is the latest headache for the embattled lender that, in May, incorrectly deposited and then tried to reverse excessive amounts of bitcoin to users’ accounts.  The order states that BlockFi held $14.7 billion through BIA sales as of March 31.  BlockFi was also hit by an attacker spamming its platform with fake sign-ups and abusive language in March.

The cryptocurrency was trading around $29,998 at press time and is down about 5% over the past week.      Bitcoin has been locked in the broad price range of $30,000 to $40,000 since mid-May, and briefly broke below the $30,000 mark on June 22. The cryptocurrency fleetingly traded at $29,700 a day after the People’s Bank of China ordered the country’s major financial institutions to stop facilitating crypto transactions.      ""I am expecting a strong dip towards $22K,"" said Patrick Heusser, head of trading at Crypto Finance AG, in a telegram interview on Monday.      Wall Street is seeing ""too much froth"" and current virus jitters are triggering widespread panic selling of every top performing asset, with bitcoin being right at the top of this list, according to Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda.      Moya said that bitcoin could be vulnerable to a flash crash towards the $20,000 level, which ""should attract many institutional buyers that have been waiting patiently on the sidelines,""      ""If the stock market sell-off intensifies, bitcoin and ethereum will easily extend their declines,"" said Moya.      Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, said the consolidation phase bitcoin is currently experiencing is ""neutral.""

According to the SEC’s complaint, 86-year-old Joy Kovar and her son, 54-year-old Brent Kovar, raised over $12 million from at least 277 retail investors through their Las Vegas-based company Profit Connect Wealth Services since May 2018.      The mother-son duo allegedly told investors that Profit Connect invested in forex, stocks and other assets “to diversify its income stream from the company’s main income source of blockchain mining.” The Kovars touted the ability of a supercomputer and artificial intelligence to generate 20%-30% fixed returns per year with monthly compounding interest.      Instead, the SEC alleges, the Kovars transferred “millions of dollars to Joy Kovar’s personal bank account,” spent millions of dollars to promote Profit Connect, and made “Ponzi-like payments to other investors.” The SEC says over 90% of Profit Connect’s funds came from investors.      Brent Kovar used social media to market the firm’s offerings. In a YouTube video, he presents what he says is a mining card to show the audience “what they look like,” and says his company uses artificial intelligence “to only decode [those mining cards] off the blockchain that actually have transactions.”      The complaint alleges Brent Kovar received almost $353,000 of investor funds, which he used to purchase a home.
