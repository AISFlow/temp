This move to proof of stake will see miners be flushed out in favor of validators who earn rewards for staking their ETH, and more investors want to take advantage of this. This has seen Ethereum hit new milestones, while the most recent one has to do with the amount of ETH staked. Staked ETH Crosses 13.3 Million Staked ETH on the Ethereum network has now reached a new milestone of 13.3 million.

The price range between $1700 and $1800 is the crucial support level, and it is crucial for ETH to maintain above it to stop any further falls. Technically speaking, Ethereum is advancing inside a rising wedge (in yellow), which is a bearish trend. The trade volume on Binance is also declining concurrently. This implies that the number of buyers is gradually dropping. Assume that the bulls can prevent the pair from breaking below the important support in the $1,700-$1,800 region (shown in green).

42422574,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0mIjh,1660600184,Crypto Lender Celsius On Pace to Run Out of Cash by October,"Celsius Network, the crypto lender that filed for bankruptcy in July, appears to be in even worse financial straits than previously signaled.  A new court filing Monday from Kirkland & Ellis, a law firm the crypto lender hired to lead its restructuring efforts, included financial projections that Celsius will run out of cash by October.  The filing, submitted to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York in advance of an upcoming hearing, also stated that the crypto lender holds $2.8 billion less in crypto than it owes to depositors.  “My initial thought was, ‘Wow, that's a big hole.’ It’s pretty tough,” Thomas Braziel, founder of 507 Capital, an investment firm that provides financing around bankruptcies and reorganizations, told CoinDesk.  Celsius was caught up in this year's crypto crisis, which led to withdrawal suspensions and insolvencies of various lenders, exchanges and investment companies. Celsius halted all user withdrawals in June, citing “extreme market conditions.”  Last month, Celsius filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and acknowledged that it had a $1.2 billion hole in its balance sheet – liabilities exceeding assets – after it paid off its debt to decentralized finance protocols. That calculation included the estimated value of the firm’s mining equipment and unspecified “other” assets.  Read more: Celsius Lays Out Mining-Focused Reorganization Plan at First Bankruptcy Hearing  Running out of money  The latest disclosure showed that Celsius holds cash that is enough for less than three months, and it forecasted that the company will run out of money by the end of October.  In the monthly cash flow forecast, the firm disclosed a beginning cash balance of almost $130 million at the start of August.  Given the firm’s operating expenses and other costs including expenditure for restructuring efforts are expected to total $137 million for the next three months, the balance would turn negative in October. By then, the firm projects it would have liquidity of negative $33.9 million.  “They [Celsius] could obtain debtor-in-possession financing or sell assets,” Brandon M. Hammer, counsel at Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton, a law firm, told CoinDesk. “However, to take such steps they would need court approval, which requires notice and an opportunity for interested parties, like customers and the creditors committee, to object."" (Neither Hammer nor the law firm are involved in the bankruptcy case.)  Bitcoin hole  The document also showed that Celsius’ liabilities in crypto to customers surpasses $6.6 billion while the lender only holds $3.3 billion of digital coins – for a $2.8 billion difference as of July 29.  “The coin deficit seems somewhat greater than the losses described in the first day disclosures,” Hammer said. “It also appears that the company likely had to sell assets at depressed prices to meet customer withdrawals before the 'pause.' Such sales are common in bank run situations and may, depending on the particular facts, be subject to clawback risk.”  The most alarming is the hole in bitcoin holdings. Celsius disclosed it owes $2.5 billion in bitcoin (104,962 BTC) while the firm holds $348 million in bitcoin (14,578 BTC) and $557 million in a type of bitcoin derivative (23,348 wBTC).  “The bitcoin hole is huge, much bigger than I would have suspected,” Braziel said.  The lender also holds $1 billion less in ether (ETH) than what it owes to users, although the 410,000 stETH, an ether derivative token, is still in the firm’s possession. The hole in USDC stablecoin holdings accrues to $666 million.  The issue with CEL token  According to the filing, Celsius has 658 million CEL tokens in its treasury; this is the platform’s utility token. Celsius owes 279 million of the tokens to clients, leaving the firm with a 379 million surplus . At current market prices, the CEL net position would be worth almost $1 billion, more than double than what’s in the document, as the token is in the middle of a social media-driven short squeeze attempt.  Still, the price rise does not help the company solve its balance sheet problem. Most of the token’s supply is locked up on the platform and liquidity on exchanges is thin. If the firm would try to sell CEL to cover a part of the hole on its balance sheet, prices would likely tank.  “The asset side of the CEL holding is probably worth zero,” Braziel said, adding that the liabilities are still there because CEL token owners will probably try to come after Celsius and claim for $1 per token.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/08/15/crypto-lender-celsius-on-pace-to-run-out-of-cash-by-october,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/677c54b314fe95f7e866fb1b13c5fe9217bc9e55-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42422561,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0mIXh,1660598675,Blockchain Scalability Firm StarkWare Launches Recursion to Streamline Ethereum,"Ethereum is heading for a major overhaul known as the Merge to make the blockchain faster and more energy efficient. StarkWare, a company addressing blockchain scalability issues, revealed last week a new recursive proof that it said can bundle tens of millions of non-fungible token (NFT) mints into one transaction, which would turbocharge layer 2 scalability.  “After turning on recursion this week, we now have the ability to fit tens of millions of NFT mints into a single recursive proof, and therefore into a single Ethereum transaction,” said Eli Ben-Sasson, president and co-founder at StarkWare, in a media brief provided to CoinDesk. “We’re not using recursion at this intensity yet, but the tech is in place and the moment that traffic merits it, we will. This is what blockchain scaling is all about – building to prevent tomorrow’s bottleneck.”  How it works  Rollup technologies ease the load on the main Ethereum chain by bundling hundreds of transactions off-chain then sending that bundle in as one transaction. Optimistic rollups use a network of validators to ensure the data inside each bundle is legitimate, which comes with a lag time in case validators want to challenge data. Zero-knowledge (zk) rollups, also called validity rollups, use cryptography to mathematically validate the bundle before it reaches Ethereum.  StarkWare is one of the companies, alongside zkSync and Aztec, that offers zk rollups and uses its own cryptographic method called STARKs.

42411395,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNXso,1660597323,Stop Attacking DeFi Founders for Complying With the Tornado Cash Sanction,"It is perfectly reasonable, and possibly preferable, for Ethereum blockchain-based apps to block users with exposure to Tornado Cash, following the sanction of that anonymizing service last week. The alternative would likely open large parts of the Ethereum network to criminal liability. And that would include founding teams who are building the nascent, alternative economy of decentralized finance (DeFi),  That is not to condone the Treasury Department’s action against Tornado Cash, which is based on the idea that Tornado Cash was used to launder $7 billion worth of digital assets since it was founded in 2019. As many legal experts and industry representatives have said, preventing all Americans from using a privacy-preserving technology is overly broad and potentially unconstitutional.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Tornado Cash is an open-source cryptocurrency “mixer” that allows people to shield their transaction history on the Ethereum blockchain. It’s permissionless, meaning anyone can interact with it, and immutable, meaning its code, having already been deployed, cannot be altered.  Crucially, in crypto, there’s a distinction between a protocol and the service that most users will interact with. These access routes are called “front-ends” and are essentially sites or widgets deployed on the web that interact with an unchangeable smart contract on a blockchain.  See also: Cloning Tornado Cash Would Be Easy, but Risky | Valid Points  This distinction has been spotlighted in recent days, as the crypto industry begins to reckon with the magnitude of the Tornado ban. Projects, in attempting to comply with sanctions law by erecting walls and surveillance around their front-ends, are being criticized for supposedly undermining the core tenets of DeFi.  The decentralization debate  It’s all part of a long-simmering debate about what aspects of “decentralization” can be sacrificed for the sake of network growth and long-term viability. Moreover, it shows the strategic differences between those who would work within the constraints of the law and those building around it.  Last week, several prominent DeFi projects including decentralized exchange dYdX and the Aave platform confirmed they have begun to prevent use of their own front-ends by crypto wallets that are in any way tied to Tornado Cash. Other companies, like NFT (non-fungible token) marketplace OpenSea, have likely started doing that, too, but haven’t confirmed it publicly.  This comes after crypto compliance software providers such as Chainalysis or Elliptic pinpointed a “sudden influx” of flagged accounts, according to dYdX. At this time, it’s unknown to what extent authorities will enforce the sanction, which is broad enough to affect any address – whether receiver or sender – daisy chained to Tornado.  While only a fraction of a percent of wallets have a direct link to Tornado Cash, almost half the entire Ethereum network is only “two hops” away from an address that received funds from Tornado. ElBarto_Crypto, an anonymous researcher for data shop Block119, called this the “six degrees of Tornado Cash.”  “Everyone flaming DeFi companies for using compliance tools should host the Uniswap front-end on their domain with no blocking,” dYdX founder Antonio Juliano tweeted this past weekend. He meant that ironically as a way to get people to think about the risks associated with running a non-compliant website, but the same sentiment has been offered as a genuine solution.  Bootlickers?  The phrase “bootlicker” has been thrown around to describe the decisions of Uniswap, Aave and others here. And to some extent, the anger is justifiable. At a fundamental level, these applications are breaking the fungibility of ETH – creating two parallel economies of “compliant” and gray market tokens that can be used only in certain places – to mitigate their own potential liability.  DeFi is meant to be an alternative to the traditional economic system, offering many of the same (and few new) financial services without middlemen. Without permissionless access, crypto risks simply recreating the old way with more convoluted steps. It’s reasonable to ask what separates DeFi from the banks if all its on-ramps start to report and censor transactions.  There’s another way of seeing the situation, however, and that begins with decreasing the importance given to front-ends. Most users interact only with Uniswap.io and not the command line – that is precisely the issue. DeFi users shouldn’t rely on protocol founders to build user interfaces, considering the other risks they are assuming.  Decrypt Editor-in-Chief Daniel Roberts referred to this situation as a “litmus test” for those who are truly committed to DeFi. But it seems like a false distinction, hung up on rhetoric, that is asking developers to run head-first into legal trouble. All while Ethereum doesn’t need websites to run.  As prominent crypto personality/investor Eric Wall put it: “Let them censor. let them be compliant. Let them continue to operate in the open, in a way that the govs can't say they've done anything wrong.” He added: “It is OUR job to make sure there are alternative backups to access the back ends. That's something that's easy to do, requires little coordination and doesn't need cooperation from Aave.”  See also: An Alleged Tornado Cash Developer Was Arrested. Are You Next? | The Node  I don’t know what it would take to build a massive redundancy of “decentralized” front-ends, but I suspect it’s slightly unrealistic. But so are the very ends of DeFi. And I suspect truly disintermediating financial giants and the government from an economy would take a “community.”  The risk of hosting easy access points to DeFi services should be split between interested parties. That would bolster the “social decentralization” of the ecosystem, assuming that everything technically works as promised.  ‘New age’  This process has the potential to slow adoption of crypto. Instead of having a website that you can access by searching for a protocol’s name, you might need to “torrent” a service or use a similarly named (and thus, at face value, kind of sketchy) version of an app. There would likely be “link-rot” if people cannot maintain their websites, and you may have to do a little research to find out what sites are being updated and can still be trusted.  Last week, Rune Christtensen, founder of MakerDAO, the issuer of the dai stablecoin, said the U.S. sanction will likely usher in a “new age” of DeFi. Whereas the pre-sanction period emphasized user acquisition and protocol growth, the new period would recenter decentralization as a primary goal. What this means is still in process, though Christensen suggested that Maker could de-peg its stablecoin from the U.S. dollar, which represents a wild departure from its existing project.  Likewise, protocol developers across the board should redouble their efforts to make their systems resilient against hostile attacks. The key is to maintain a functioning back end that can always be accessed, while also complying with the law.  Protocols should still offer a version of a front-end, but be totally transparent about what data they collect and their terms of use. It’s likely that assuming the Tornado Cash sanction is unsuccessfully challenged, crypto surveillance-ware will become more effective and less burdensome.  Part of the recent backlash stems from the sheer number of people who were denied access to applications they were used to using, although they don’t think of themselves as a sanctions evader or money launderer. Gabriel Shapiro, a crypto lawyer, said the current grade of financial compliance software used by crypto companies and DeFi projects are “blunt weapons.”  These systems, built by companies like Chainalysis, filter for any connection to Tornado without concern for why or how that connection was made. And certainly, there are legitimate reasons for using a transaction anonymizer.  Still here  Before last week’s sanction, Tornado’s developers took steps to limit who could use the web-facing service they built. Some criticized the move for abandoning the project’s raison d'etat and increasing surveillance of the network.  Others recognized it as a way to move toward compliance following a high-profile crypto hack that was laundered through Tornado. While that direction ultimately didn’t work out for them, it doesn’t change that Tornado is still up and running.  See also: It Can't Be 'Decentralization or Bust' | Opinion  What’s equally remarkable is that the Tornado DAO is still attempting to manage the project. This past weekend, it voted unanimously to add signatories for the project’s $22 million treasury in an attempt to make the project more resilient in case of arrests. It did so despite the project’s Discord and GitHub being taken down.

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization reached as high as $25,212 early in the U.S. trading day before retreating to its current level above $24,000.  This article originally appeared in Market Wrap, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Ether’s (ETH) price declined 4% on Monday, but it remained above the $1,900 level it has maintained since late last week. In overnight activity, ETH briefly surpassed $2,000.  Both BTC and ETH traded on average volume, using the 20-day exponential moving averages (EMA) as a barometer for normality.  Traditional markets started the week relatively flat, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and tech-heavy Nasdaq composite up 0.1%, 0.2% and 0.3% respectively.  Commodities were in decline, with the prices of crude oil and natural gas down 4% and 1.3%, respectively. The price of gold, a traditional safe haven asset, contracted 1.09%, while copper’s price sank 1.7%.

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Technical Take  BTC’s hourly chart highlights the attempt to surpass $25,000  The hourly chart below illustrates BTC's brief move above $25,000 before it retreated.  However, that move occurred within a candle that finished the hour in negative territory, indicating that bitcoin isn’t ready to hold $25,000 support. A trading candle illustrates an asset's high, low, opening and closing price within a chart. Bitcoin’s price rose 2.7% before the start of U.S. trading before declining 3.5%.  BTC appeared to be settling into a range between $24,000 and $25,000, with trading volume recently declining. A lack of trading volume for an asset can imply lesser trader conviction about an asset’s potential gains.  Bollinger bands on BTC’s daily chart indicate a reversion to mean  BTC’s Bollinger bands indicate that prices may retreat to $23,500. For context, Bollinger bands measure the moving average for an asset and calculate values that are two standard deviations above and below the aforementioned moving average.  Traders often use Bollinger bands to determine whether prices have drifted too far from an asset’s short-term average. The question that Bollinger bands attempt to answer is whether an asset’s price is excessively high or low compared with its recent activity.  Traditionally, when prices breach the upper range of the Bollinger band, investors see them as being too high. Conversely, when an asset’s price breaches the lower end of its bollinger band, investors view them as too low.  Because the bands are based on standard deviation of price moves, they contract when volatility decreases and expand when volatility increases.  In BTC’s daily chart, prices on Monday have been flirting with the upper range of its bands. On several occasions BTC’s price has reverted to the mean/middle band following instances where it touched the upper and/or lower bands.  Investors can look at what happened on July 30, July 20 and July 8 as examples of this reversion. Should BTC prices behave as they did during those past occasions, BTC's price would revert to $23,500.

Monday's announcement would seemingly move the U.S. central bank one step closer to possibly allowing Wyoming special purpose depository institutions (SPDI), like Custodia (formerly Avanti) and Kraken Bank, access to these accounts so they would not need intermediary banks. The Fed first proposed guidance last year, opening up a request-for-comment process. Nearly 300 respondents filed comments, leading to a second public feedback process earlier this year.  In a statement, Fed Vice Chair Lael Brainard said, ""The new guidelines provide a consistent and transparent process to evaluate requests for Federal Reserve accounts and access to payment services in order to support a safe, inclusive, and innovative payment system.""  The guidance is largely similar to what was first proposed in 2021, and will create a multi-tiered system allowing the Fed to adapt its evaluation process for granting access depending on what kind of financial institution is applying. Each tier corresponds to a respectively more stringent review process.  Under the guidance, Tier 1 banks would be federally insured. Tier 2 banks would not be federally insured but are still ""subject to prudential supervision by a federal banking agency.""  The third tier consists of firms that are ""not federally insured and not subject to prudential supervision by a federal banking agency,"" which would most likely apply to the Wyoming crypto banks.  According to a statement published with the guidance and press release, the Fed received comments after publishing both its initial proposed guidance in 2021 and its updated guidance earlier this year. Many of these commenters filed a form letter but the Fed appears to have received a hair under 70 unique responses.  ""Many commenters, on the other hand, recommended that the Proposed Guidelines should provide a more challenging path for institutions with novel charters to gain access to accounts and services. Many of these commenters argued that the Proposed Guidelines should subject non-federally insured institutions to the same types of requirements as apply to federally insured depository institutions, regardless of the institution’s business model,"" the document said.  Long road  Custodia and Kraken both applied for master account access in 2021, shortly before the Fed published its initial proposal.  David Kinitsky, the CEO of Kraken Bank, told CoinDesk at the time that the proposal was a positive step for his company.  “There's nothing novel in terms of the factors that they're including here. It's exactly the type of things that the Federal Reserve is looking at, in terms of risk to the reserve itself, risk to the payment system [and] risk to the economy,"" he said.  Both companies received routing numbers earlier this year, a key step in gaining access to master accounts (though not indicative that the companies will for sure receive access).  Still, Custodia sued the Fed in June on allegations of violating a mandatory one-year deadline in deciding whether to grant the Wyoming firm access or not.

Despite the short-term downside price action, crypto analyst Justin Bennett believes SOL&apos;s price is on track to register a massive increase. This big move to the upside could play out over the course of the coming months and push Solana&apos;s price into a 40% move to the upside. According to Bennett, SOL has drawn a triangle pattern over the past months. The price of Solana has been moving to the upper side of this triangle which should operate as critical resistance north of SOL&apos;s current levels. In the daily chart below, and as stated by the analyst, the upper side of this triangle pattern can be traced to 2021 as SOL moved into its all-time high.

42421824,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXwAEH,1660585217,DeFi vs. CeFi in Crypto,"Many people think of crypto as a single-faceted industry revolving around cryptocurrencies. But scratch the surface a little, and you will find plenty of fragmentations within the industry that often contrast with each other.  The cryptocurrency market crash of spring 2022 brought to the fore a key distinction in the crypto industry: that of centralized finance (CeFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi).  In this piece, we’ll explore the characteristics of CeFi and DeFi.  DeFi vs CeFi: points of difference  DeFi is short for “decentralized finance,” an umbrella term for a variety of financial applications built on the blockchain. These applications or platforms are typically built using smart contracts, which are pieces of code that determine the rules a DeFi protocol operates under.  Users who interact with DeFi smart contracts do similar things that they would do in traditional finance (or centralized crypto finance), such as borrow money, make loans or trade assets. The only difference is that all of that takes place without intermediaries, and the entire operation runs on code.  DeFi protocols include but aren't limited to spot exchanges like Uniswap, derivatives trading platforms like GMX, options trading platforms like Opyn and lending platforms like Aave. The DeFi industry commanded $69 billion in assets as of August 2022, according to DefiLlama, a site that tracks the amount locked in DeFi. That’s up from less than $1 billion at the start of 2020.  Most DeFi protocols coordinate through decentralized autonomous organizations, or DAOs, where holders of governance tokens (such as UNI for Uniswap) decide matters, like treasury allocations or changes to tokenomics. Decision-making and transactions through the protocol are transparent through public blockchain explorers, such as Etherscan.  CeFi is different. On the surface, CeFi looks like traditional finance businesses. CeFi firms are private companies that deal primarily with blockchain assets like cryptocurrencies or NFTs (non-fungible tokens). There are no open-source smart contracts underpinning their operations (they aren’t built in the blockchain after all), and they make their own rules behind closed doors, just as other private companies do. Users interacting with them are essentially paying customers.  CeFi is not to be confused with TradFi, or traditional finance, which comprises centuries-old legacy institutions like J.P. Morgan Chase or BNY Mellon. Outside of crypto, TradFi is simply known as the financial sector.  CeFi businesses include lending platforms like BlockFi and exchanges like FTX.  DeFi is permissionless, meaning anyone can make use of financial applications available on the blockchain. CeFi businesses use DeFi protocols. In fact, Celsius Network was also one of the largest players in the DeFi markets before the company went bust in June 2022.  How things can go wrong with CeFi  The collapse of Terra in May 2022 showed how an entire ecosystem can blow up as a result of unsustainable design in DeFi. It also had a domino effect on CeFi via crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (also known as 3AC), which was heavily invested in Terra and had borrowed billions of dollars in cryptocurrencies from CeFi lenders to make such investments and pursue other risky strategies across the crypto industry.  The founders of 3AC cited Terra as one of the two major factors in its demise. The other were investments in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (Grayscale Investments is owned by Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk).  The CeFi lenders were overconfident in 3AC and lent those funds without securing sufficient collateral. When the crypto market crashed, 3AC failed to pay back the loans. Investors claim that the defunct fund owes them $2.8 billion.  Three main causes explain the collapse of major CeFi lenders:  Unsustainable yields – CeFi lenders offered high yields. They achieved that by investing customer funds in risky DeFi protocols like Terra. When those protocols collapsed, CeFi lenders couldn’t keep paying high yields.  Lack of transparency – CeFi lenders are structured as private companies with business operations and balance sheets away from prying eyes. DeFi protocols operate through public smart contracts and governance forums.  Under-collateralized lending – CeFi lenders offer customized lending terms, which in the case of 3AC, meant under-collateralized and even non-collateralized lending, exposing them to high financial risks. Borrowing in DeFi is typically over-collateralized.  Although high yields tend to raise eyebrows, they aren’t necessarily problematic as long as they are backed by a legitimate money market where rates are dynamically determined by supply and demand. Alas, that wasn’t the case in this instance.

42394933,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASWYu1,1660585158,Price Discount on 'stETH' Reflects Some Doubt on Smooth Ethereum Merge,"Crypto investors are eagerly awaiting the Merge, the Ethereum blockchain’s long-awaited technology upgrade.  Most traders expect the event to go through smoothly. But the price of a popular ether (ETH) derivative token known as stETH suggests a slim chance that some glitches or delays will arise, based on a new analysis by Enigma Securities, an institutional digital assets advisory and brokerage firm.  According to Enigma, the current price of stETH – a type of ether derivative known as ""staked ether,"" which is a token issued by Lido protocol that users can trade freely even when their ether is staked on the Ethereum blockchain – implies a nearly 6.25%-6.5% probability the Merge will come with major bugs or delays.  Enigma’s pricing model treats stETH as a bond of 1 ETH as principal that yields a 4% return annually. If the Merge is successful, an investor who bought stETH gets 1.04 ETH in a year.  With stETH changing hands at 0.973 ETH at press time, the price implies only a 93.5%-93.75% chance of the Merge going through smoothly and on time, Enigma estimates. This percentage is lower than what many market watchers are expecting because all the dress rehearsals went well.  “The market has high confidence in the Merge,” John Freyermuth, analyst at Enigma Securities told CoinDesk. “But until that risk premium shrinks to match the staking yield, stETH price supports the view that the Merge is not priced in.""  Ethereum’s transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism is set to fundamentally alter the blockchain of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.  It will eliminate mining, reduce the network’s energy consumption by about 99.95% and turn ETH into a yield-bearing asset. At press time, the Merge is scheduled to go live at some point in September.  “I am completely confident that it will go well,” Ben Edgington, global product lead for institutional Ethereum staking service Teku at software firm ConsenSys, told CoinDesk. “Every testnet Merge that we've done and every test scenario we have run over the last six months has met these criteria for a successful Merge.”  Merge hype has helped ETH, the blockchain's native token, to surge to $2,000 over the weekend from around $1,000 a month ago.  “Right now, different actors are betting on whether or not the Merge happens, as a sentiment bet,” said Lex Sokolin, head economist at ConsenSys. “If it does happen, that shifts us to a new regime.”  Writing Off ETHPOW  The discount on stETH to ether also narrowed to around 3% from the lows of 7% in June, when the token was caught in the middle of a liquidity crisis that led to the insolvency of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital and crypto lender Celsius Network.  The current stETH price shows “incredibly low-risk premia that's packed with the Merge execution risk, smart contract risks and any systemic risk,” Enigma’s Freyermuth said.  According to Enigma, crypto traders are mostly discounting the impact of a potential fork of the Ethereum blockchain by proof-of-work miners, or that an airdropped ""ETHPOW"" or ""ETHW"" token would have any significant value. The logic there is that the stETH discount has narrowed, not increased, since the possibility of a fork began to swirl through the crypto-industry discourse over the past couple weeks.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/08/15/ether-derivative-token-suggests-the-merge-is-not-fully-priced-in-yet,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/295d5f58adf511c81ea269633f67967dee7ee0c7-1466x1100.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

With this recent recovery, the price of bitcoin has made its way to sit comfortably above $24,000 presently. The digital asset had tested one of the most coveted spots on Sunday but had sadly been rejected. That has not stopped it, though, as bitcoin is gearing up for another rally towards $25,000. $25,000 For Bitcoin Price After touching $25,000 on Sunday, the bitcoin price had taken a swift beating down. This led to an inevitable slump below $24,000 but would prove to only last for a short time. After being pushed back down, bitcoin was able to find support just below $24,000 and used that as a bounce-off point to regain strength above the technical level. Related Reading: Cardano Price Sits Pretty At $0.5, Why A Breakout Is On The Horizon Even with the decline, it had been able to hold well above the 50-day moving average, thereby keeping its bullish trend on track. What this shows is that bitcoin is not ready to give up the fight at $25,000 just yet. Instead, it is expected that another test of this resistance level will happen on Monday.

BitGo, which is one of the biggest custodians in the crypto industry, said it will seek $100 million in damages from Galaxy. In a press release, it said Galaxy is refusing to pay this previously promised breakup fee.  “The attempt by Mike Novogratz and Galaxy Digital to blame the termination on BitGo is absurd,” said R. Brian Timmons, a partner with Quinn Emanuel, the law firm BitGo has retained. Novogratz is Galaxy's CEO.  In the press release, Timmons pointed to Galaxy's recent losses, which he said range in the hundreds of millions of dollars.  ""Either Galaxy owes BitGo a $100 million termination fee as promised or it has been acting in bad faith and faces damages of that much or more,” Timmons said.  A spokesperson for Galaxy told CoinDesk that the company believes ""BitGo's claims are without merit and we will defend ourselves vigorously. As previously stated, BitGo did not provide certain BitGo financial statements needed by Galaxy for its SEC filing.

Its transparency, security, and cost-efficiency have benefited many industries like supply chain and payments in taking the next quantum leap. However, there has been minimal traction in the $360 Trillions1 Real-World Assets (RWA) market including intellectual property, commodities, and other assets. The marketplaces for these assets are fragmented and full of frictions resulting in the lack of liquidity and interests from both asset owners and investors. Seeing the size of market opportunity, blockchain platforms emerged with promising solutions involving asset tokenization. By leveraging smart contracts and blockchain technology, RWA can be turned into digital tokens resulting in greater access to exposure and liquidity. 1Real World Asset value is estimated to be $256T in 2018 and applying 5% annual growth until 2025 (Futurism article based on Credit Suisse figures) Bringing Real-World Assets to Life Let&apos;s pick an example of commodities.

42421815,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXwA97,1660573352,How to Get Liquidity From NFTs Without Selling Them,"If you’ve ever used marketplaces such as OpenSea, LooksRare or Magic Eden, you’re likely familiar with the process of minting, buying and selling non-fungible tokens (NFT). Similar to other crypto assets, the price of an individual NFT can fluctuate depending on factors including rarity and utility, and keen traders will often monitor market changes to make a smart sale.  Unlike the cryptocurrency market, you can’t always sell NFTs instantly and will need to wait until an interested buyer accepts your set purchase price or makes an agreeable offer before offloading your digital collectible, a process that could take hours, days, weeks or longer. There's no guarantee someone will buy your NFT at all and there's a limited market of people who can afford high-priced NFT collections like Bored Ape Yacht Club.  Fortunately, there are several protocols that can help you liquify your NFTs without having to sell them.  Borrowing crypto against NFT collaterals  Some decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols let you use your NFT as collateral for a loan, similar to a pawn shop.  The idea is to lock up your NFT in a digital vault in exchange for a loan of a cryptocurrency, like ETH or USDC. When the loan expires, you will need to pay the amount you borrowed, plus some interest. The lender, who provides liquidity, will earn that interest. But if you can’t clear your debt, they’ll get to keep your NFT. Some of these protocols provide loans to users through pools or they help match borrowers and lenders.  The NFT lending market is a fast-growing sector, and there are many options for prospective borrowers including some with instant liquidity options. However, sudden downturns in the cryptocurrency market, smart contract exploits and regulatory crackdowns can increase risks associated with these types of transactions.  Deposit NFT into a vault and mint a token  Another way to create liquid markets for NFTs is to deposit an NFT into a specialized vault linked to fungible tokens.  NFTx, for example, is a platform that issues NFT vault tokens backed by NFTs. A spokesperson for NFTx described the protocol’s primary function to CoinDesk as “NFT liquidity and yield-earning opportunities, bridging the gap of NFTs and DeFi,” and not one that facilitates lending and borrowing like other protocols.  On NFTx, NFT holders deposit their NFT into a vault, and mint a fungible token (vToken) in return. The token can be sold into another cryptocurrency, at the floor price of the NFT collection, to access liquidity. If and when the user wants to claim an NFT from the vault, they can bring back the token and redeem an NFT from the collection.  On NFTx, users can deposit their NFT into a vault specific to NFT collections – for example, PUNK for CryptoPunks – and mint an ERC-20 token called “vToken” that represents a 1:1 claim on a random NFT from within that collection's vault. vTokens can be pooled in automated market makers (AMM) to create a liquid market for other users to trade, and vault creators can charge fees based on minting and redeeming NFTs from their vaults.  It's important to note that the vToken represents a claim on a random NFT from the specific collection, not the exact one you deposited. In other words, you will be able to get a CryptoPunk back if you deposited into the PUNK vault, but perhaps not the one you deposited. If you want to select a specific CryptoPunk NFT from the vault, you can for an additional 5% fee.  Fractionalize your NFT  Collectors can also turn NFTs into multiple fungible tokens through fractionalization. This method involves dividing an asset into many smaller assets, making it easier for an investor to expose his portfolio to an expensive asset without having to own it. It also lowers the barrier to entry for some investors who are normally priced out of owning high-value assets.  A fractional NFT could be tied to a singular NFT or a collection of NFTs. To fractionalize an NFT, you need to lock up your NFT in a digital vault through protocols like fractional.art and issue fungible tokens that represent proportional claims over the NFT.  Usually, the owner of the fractionalized NFT will retain control over a majority portion of the issued tokens while selling some tokens for crypto. This method can also cause an NFT’s overall valuation to go up or down, as seen with the doge meme NFT.  Renting out your NFT  Lastly, you can also generate passive income by renting out your NFT.  Multi-chain NFT rental protocol and platform reNFT, for example, allows its users to rent or lend their NFTs to others, and focuses on metaverse assets such as land and game skins.  The owner of the NFT can decide on a rental fee and term duration, and renters pay the total rental fee upfront. The protocol then transfers the asset to an escrow contract that lets the user access it as a time-limited possessor but not an actual owner. When the contract expires, the asset is returned to the owner, who also pockets some rental money.  Non-fungible to fungible  There are a few ways to take a non-fungible asset and make it fungible for easier liquidity. Your choice will depend on what NFTs you hold, how quickly you are prepared to wait for liquidity and what liquidity conditions you are happy with.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Ekin Genç,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/how-to-get-liquidity-from-nfts-without-selling-them,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d3686949d63a3642b78a581f7b8794ec5961b8e8-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421114,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXZUSb,1660572323,Miner Chandler Guo Repeats Support for Ethereum Fork Post-Merge,"Ethereum miner Chandler Guo is reiterating his push for Ethereum to undergo a ""hard fork"" once it become a proof-of-stake blockchain next month in a software update known as the Merge.  Guo told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” program on Friday that he has helped organize miners to back his effort as a way to save them from having to “shut down their business.”  “This time the fork, it’s much more difficult because I need to organize a lot of people [miners] to join this fork,” Guo said.  Ethereum is making the move to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake method of maintaining its network and validating transaction from its current proof-of-work method around Sept. 15 and 16, according to developers.  Guo has been pushing for a fork for several weeks. In July, he tweeted, “I fork Ethereum once, I will fork it again!”  While the network is expected to slash upward of 99% of its energy consumption after becoming a proof-of-stake platform, Guo argues that miners should be taken into account, too.  “A lot of people [miners] are suffering,” he said  Some miners, however, may benefit from the Merge, particularly ethereum classic (ETC) miners, according to JPMorgan analysts, and CoinDesk reported on Thursday that the software update will likely make more used mining rigs available.  Guo, who has supported the fork of ethereum classic in the past, said that he plans to hold the native token of the forked proof-of-work blockchain, dubbed ETHW, until the next bull market, which he estimates that will happen in the next two years.

MetaStable, which was started in 2014 and once counted Dragonfly Managing Partner Haseeb Qureshi among its general partners, had over $400 million in assets under management as of July 31, according to Bloomberg, which initially reported on the acquisition.  MetaStable was an early investor in Ethereum, blockchain network Cosmos and blockchain scalability company StarkWare, to name a few.  Dragonfly has also dropped the “Capital” from its name and has adopted a new logo as part of a rebrand to lean into its crypto focus.  ""It’s hard to build the future when you look like the past,"" wrote Qureshi in the Medium post. ""That’s why we’re changing the way Dragonfly looks and feels. We’re dropping the 'Capital' from our name, and our new look is more crypto-native, inspired by the hackers and weirdos (we say with love!) who have built this industry from the ground up.""  Founded in 2018, Dragonfly's investment portfolio includes smart contracts platform Avalanche, layer 1 blockchain platform Near Protocol, DAI token creator MakerDAO and zkSync creator Matter Labs, among others.  In April, Dragonfly raised $650 million for its third crypto fund.

Galaxy Digital has abandoned its plan to buy BitGo, saying the crypto custody specialist had failed to provide financial statements by a deadline of July 31.  Market Moves: Options trading volume has risen on crypto exchanges, and even miners are using options strategies to muddle through the current, uncertain environment.  This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Price point  Bitcoin (BTC) is down 2% after failing to hold a crucial price point of $25,000. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization briefly hit the psychological threshold in the early hours Monday but has since fallen to $24,200.  Liquidations over the weekend were very high as BTC’s total liquidations totaled $205 million, compared with the prior weekend's figure of $15 million.  After both bitcoin and ether (ETH) reacted positively to lower-than-expected U.S. inflation last week, ether is down 5% on the day to about $1,900. The cryptocurrency briefly hit $2,012 Monday, its highest price since May.  Altcoins also were mainly down on the day apart from crypto exchange Bitfinex’s token, unus sed leo (LEO), which was up 5%.  In traditional markets, U.S. stock futures, crude prices and other commodities fell after new data showed China’s economic activity slowed across the board in July, including factory output, investment and consumer spending. China’s central bank cut key lending rates to revive demand after the weak data was released.  In crypto news, Galaxy Digital has abandoned its plan to buy BitGo, saying the crypto custody specialist had failed to provide financial statements by an end-of-July deadline. The $1.2 billion acquisition was announced May 2021 and was expected to close by the end of that year.  European digital bank Revolut has been granted authorization by the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission, allowing it to offer crypto services across the European Economic Area. The authorization will enable Revolut to offer crypto services to its 17 million customers.  And Singapore's High Court granted beleaguered crypto exchange Zipmex more than three months of creditor protection so that Zipmex can devise a funding plan, Bloomberg News reported on Monday.

A number of crypto exchanges have noted increasing trading volume after low volume earlier this year. Options strategies have figured prominently among institutional investors and even miners as they try to weather crypto’s usual volatility and a downturn that could last for months, or longer, despite recent hopeful macroeconomic signs.  More recently, traders have been using the crypto options market to bet on ether and hedge positions as the Ethereum blockchain’s highly anticipated Merge approaches. Panama-based derivatives platform Deribit, which is among the world’s largest exchanges for crypto options trading volume, told CoinDesk demand is surging ahead of the Merge.  Last week, in a disappointing second-quarter earnings report, crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) alluded to traders migrating to derivatives-focused platforms as a reason for declining trading volume on its exchange. Coinbase’s lower volume in the second quarter led to a 30% decline in revenue.  “A larger amount of trading volume took place at offshore exchanges in Q2,” Coinbase said in its report, adding: “The sequential decline in Q2 institutional trading volume was primarily driven by lower market maker volume on our trading platform. These market participants gravitate towards products such as derivatives and financing products, which are areas we’re continuing to invest in, but we don’t currently have product parity with offshore exchanges.”  A young market?  Bitcoin options trading accounts for only 2% of open derivatives contracts across exchanges trading the cryptocurrency, whose market cap is about $462 billion, according to structure product provider Enhanced Digital Group (EDG).  By comparison, traditional options trading of stocks accounts for 20% of the market cap of the S&P 500 at the Chicago Board Options Exchange , EDG said.  “When you think of all the other [S&P 500]-like products, including [exchange-traded funds], SP Minis, etc., you can see that bitcoin options have multifold growth ahead of it,” EDG quant developer Marcin Maksymiuk told CoinDesk.  Delta Exchange CEO Pankaj Balani said that sudden market shocks, technological improvements and a maturing futures market will all contribute to the growth of options.  Delta generates over $200 million in options trading volume per day, and Balani said that “options provide a way for people to get engaged with the market even in a sideways environment.” He foresees options eventually accounting for 60% of the crypto trading market.  Peter Wisniewski, managing partner of crypto-focused alternative investment fund Europa Partners, told CoinDesk the firm expects “the market to continue to mature with greater price efficiency and liquidity.” Wisniewski said the markets will likely tie options to a widening range of digital assets.  “Currently, the only crypto derivatives markets with significant liquidity are priced to bitcoin and ether, but we expect to see a continual increase of derivative instruments priced to other types of digital assets, reducing volatility and driving more investment into the space,” Wisniewski added.

The acquisition was announced May 2021 for what was, at the time, about $1.2 billion in stock and cash. It was expected to close by the end of that year. BitGo had been required to deliver audited financial statements for 2021 by July 31 and didn't do so, Galaxy Digital said in a statement Monday.  BitGo didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.  The deal stalled in March as Galaxy Digital awaited approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission of its plan to reorganize as a Delaware-based company. At the time, the terms were tweaked to account for a decline in the price of Galaxy's Toronto-traded shares over the intervening period, giving BitGo's investors a larger stake in the merged company. Galaxy's stock has tumbled another 60% since then.  On Monday, Galaxy Digital said it still intends to list its shares on Nasdaq.

The EEA includes the 27 countries that are in the European Union, plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.  Revolut, which is valued at $33 billion, became the first entity to receive approval as a crypto-asset service provider from the Cyprus regulator, the company said on Friday.  The authorization will enable Revolut to offer crypto services to its 17 million customers in the EEA out of a new crypto-asset hub in Cyprus. Revolut said its choice was down to the sophisticated regulatory regime of the island country which has also attracted the likes of Crypto.com, eToro and BitPanda.  Crypto firms are attempting to establish regulated entities in EU countries to ensure that they will be able to offer services across the economic bloc, ahead of the EU's Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation, or MiCA.  MiCA is designed to provide great consumer protection and stamp out scams, money laundering and other financial crime in the crypto industry.  With 17 million customers already across the EEA, Revolut is looking to ensure it will be able to offer them crypto services once MiCA becomes law.  Revolut also confirmed that it will continue to serve U.K. customers from its U.K.-based entity. Its registration application with the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) remains unresolved, with the firm able to offer crypto services there via the FCA's Temporary Registration Regime.  The firm has about 20 million customers worldwide and now offers exposure to around 80 crypto assets, after it added 20 new ones at the start of this month, including APE, AVAX and SAND.

42394925,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASWYp6,1660553540,DeFi Platform Acala’s Stablecoin Falls 99% After Hackers Issue 1.3B Tokens,"Polkadot-based decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Acala’s native stablecoin, aUSD, depegged on Sunday, plummeting 99% after hackers exploited a bug in a newly deployed liquidity pool to mint 1.28 billion tokens.  Acala developers said the bug was caused by a misconfiguration of the iBTC/aUSD liquidity pool shortly after it went live on Sunday. A liquidity pool is a digital pile of cryptocurrency locked in a smart contract, which results in creating liquidity for faster transactions on decentralized exchanges (DEX) and DeFi protocols.  After noticing the exploit, the Acala team disabled the transfer functionality of the “erroneously minted aUSD” remaining on the Acala parachain. Parachains refer to custom, project-specific blockchains that are integrated within the Polkadot and Kusama networks and can be customized for any number of use cases.  A wallet believed to belong to the attacker still contains approximately 1.27 billion aUSD. Acala has asked white-hat hackers to return the stolen funds to Polkadot or Moonbeam addresses.  On-chain sleuths have pointed out that the attacker who minted 1.28 billion aUSD was not the only person to take advantage of the bug – several other users allegedly stole thousands of dollars worth of DOT from the liquidity pool.  The Twitter account @alice_und_bob estimated that the ""damage"" was $0 to $10 million, ""likely around 1.6M USD with chance of recovery.""  Launched earlier this year, aUSD successfully held its soft peg to the U.S. dollar until the hack. After the attack, the price of aUSD plunged from roughly $1.03 per token to $0.009.  Acala developers said Sunday night that would continue to trace the on-chain activity to resolve the error mint of aUSD and try to restore aUSD peg.  Later on Monday, Acala community members created a proposal that would result in the return of all erroneously minted aUSD to the protocol and the tokens later being burnt.  Acala did not return requests for comments at press time.

Captivating listeners with catchy lyrics and an animated music video featuring the iconic horse-riding dance, Gangnam Style hit the unprecedented 1-billion views mark on YouTube just 159 days after its premiere. The song&apos;s immense popularity and rapid global reach quickly thrust Korean pop culture into the international spotlight, a phenomenon known as the &apos;Hallyu&apos; or Korean wave movement.

Bitcoin Tests $25K Again; Ether Declines  By James Rubin  Bitcoin pushed bravely closer to $25,000 for the third time in four days before retreating nearer more familiar ground.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $24,400, roughly flat over the past 24 hours and slightly lower than where it started the weekend, although investors remained cautiously optimistic about recent economic indicators showing inflation waning and a lower likelihood of recession. Bitcoin has climbed the past three weeks to change hands toward the upper end of a $20,000 to $24,000 range.  ""BTC's resilience above $20,000 did see bulls pushing for more upside, especially after a successful retest of that range,"" Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital, wrote CoinDesk. ""However, we are yet to witness the breakout above $25,000, which could see BTC moving quickly toward the $29,000-$30,000 range.""  Ether was recently down about 1.6% over the previous day to trade at about $1,950. The second-largest crypto by market cap behind bitcoin has been lately gaining ground at an even faster pace than bitcoin and topped $2,000 for a second consecutive day on Saturday before declining. Ether's surge has come as the hotly anticipated Merge, which will transform the Ethereum protocol from proof-of-work to a faster, less energy-sapping model looms closer. Ethereum completed its third and final test environment network (testnet) merge, Goerli last Wednesday.  Most other altcoins were in the red in late weekend trading with OP and QUICK off about 8% and 7%, respectively, although popular meme coin SHIB was up over 30% and DOGE jumped more than 10%.  Equity markets  Crypto gains have largely tracked stocks, which have also been regaining ground in recent weeks after a dismal first seven months. The tech-focused Nasdaq and S&P 500, which has a heavy tech component, closed Friday up 2.1% and 1.7%, respectively, as investors continued to savor Wednesday's unexpectedly favorable consumer price index (CPI) showing July prices rising at a lower rate than the previous month. Markets are hopeful the data will allow the U.S. central bank to ratchet back its next interest rate hike to 50 basis points, a less aggressive approach than it has been following.  The Nasdaq and S&P have risen four consecutive weeks, their longest weekly upturn since last November. The Nasdaq has gained 20% since June to escape its lengthiest bear market run since 2008.  Crypto news  Meanwhile, crypto industry news was mixed on Friday. India's Enforcement Directorate (ED), a government agency that is responsible for probing financial crimes, froze assets worth 3.7 billion rupees ($46.4 million) at crypto exchange Vauld, it said in a statement. The U.S. Commodities Futures and Trading Commission (CFTC) accused an Ohio man of running a $12 million bitcoin Ponzi scheme, filing a cease-and-desist order over allegations he scammed investors interested in digital assets.  But the mood was upbeat at Canada's largest blockchain conference last week amid a keynote address by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, a hackathon and panels.  DiPasquale noted warily that current macroeconomic uncertainties will continue to cloud bitcoin's future pricing. ""It may be too early to think that the macroeconomic woes are behind us,"" he said. ""This month's closing and the entirety of September will be key for the crypto market on account of a few factors, including the next [Federal Open Market Committee] as well as the anticipated Ethereum Merge. If both BTC and ETH can manage to retain their gains and consolidate until the end of September, we could see a bigger rally leading into Q4.""

Korea Play-to-Earn Bans Likely to Remain in Place  By Sam Reynolds  Walking the halls of Korea Blockchain Week, it would be hard to miss the advertising for play-to-earn games. Dozens of companies attended the conference to show off new play-to-earn games that they hope will be the next Axie Infinity.  There’s only one problem: Technically these games are illegal in South Korea.  As CoinDesk has reported before, converting game tokens into cash – a staple of GameFi – has been banned in South Korea for longer than blockchain has existed. Article 32 of South Korea’s Gaming Industry Promotion Act banning the monetization of gaming tokens that became law in 2004 as the arcade game Seatalk (바다이야기) swept the nation. There’s also Article 28 of the Act, which prohibits speculative acts, gambling and free gifts in-game.  South Korean authorities have used the laws to order Apple’s App Store and Google Pay store to remove Play-to-Earn games.  While some stakeholders expect a reversal of this ban under the crypto-friendly Yoon Suk-Yeol administration, this hasn’t been signaled to the industry. In Seoul, CoinDesk gaming company sources who are familiar with regulatory affairs said the regulatory guidance they’ve received from authorities remains the status quo. There’s no indication, they said, that change is coming.  If something were to happen it would be incremental. Regulators in-country, still spooked by the 1997 Asian financial crisis, tend to be conservative and prefer to move slowly.  Slow change?  “Play-to-earn also comes in many different forms and If the lift of the ban happens, I think it will be partial,” Oleg Smagin, a senior crypto finance manager at Seoul-based Post Voyager, a GameFi service developer, told CoinDesk. “For example, the government can start by allowing free-to-play [non-fungible token] games with play-to-earn elements, especially as big South Korean gaming studios believe that introducing non-fungible tokens in the games is less risky compared to launching fully crypto-backed games with a fungible asset as a currency.”  Smagin also thinks the government would look at the track record of success these play-to-earn titles have had overseas when making its decision.  As the South Korean government is doing that, it will no undoubtedly consider how other regulators are approaching GameFi, and its $8.5 billion market cap, when determining its next steps.  In Thailand, the Thai Securities and Exchange Commission urged investors to be cautious citing the high volatility of the tokens and hacking risk. But those two risk factors are old news to anyone remotely familiar with cryptocurrency.  The real question that might be debated in the next few years is if these GameFi NFTs and tokens are securities.
