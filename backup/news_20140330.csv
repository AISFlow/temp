42425576,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIZF7h,1396179329,"Mt. Gox Used Client Money for Operations and Extravagances, Allege Staff","Mt. Gox allegedly spent money from its clients' deposits on operating expenses including extravagances as early as two years before it went bankrupt, according to new claims by employees.  In a series of exclusive interviews given to Reuters in Tokyo, the small group of anonymous current and former Mt. Gox employees claim to have approached CEO Mark Karpeles about their concerns in early 2012, but their requests to view the company's financial records were rebuffed.  Mt. Gox spent money, said Reuters’ report, on rent in the same high-status Tokyo office building as Hulu and Google, office equipment that included a robot and a 3D printer, and a special edition Honda Civic imported for CEO Mark Karpeles from the UK.  This occurred just as the company, and bitcoin itself, were beginning to expand and gain interest from investors.  Staff kept in the dark  The employees, worried that Gox was spending more money than was coming in, requested a formal meeting with Karpeles and asked for proof that client deposit amounts were protected.  After a one-hour meeting, Karpeles assured them customer money was not being used improperly but would not provide any evidence, leaving them dissatisfied.  It fits with other unofficial reports of a general malaise in the office and personal dissatisfaction with Karpeles, who employees have claimed paid little attention to Mt. Gox's exchange business and an excessive amount on side projects like the company's planned Bitcoin Cafe and its transaction processing system.  Legally, Mt. Gox was under no obligation to release any financial details in the time it operated, since it was a privately-held company 88% owned by Karpeles.  Extensions and refusals  In other Gox news, the company website has been updated to announce that the deadline for an examination report issued by the Tokyo District Court has been extended to 9th May.  Late last week it was also revealed Karpeles is refusing to travel to the US for questioning, as part of the Gregory Greene lawsuit.  Greene and Joseph Lack had requested a US judge order Karpeles to the US to testify, ""in order to protect domestic creditors."" Karpeles, apparently, has declined to go to the US and offered instead to go to Taiwan, for questioning by lawyers live or via video link.  Steven Woodrow, a lawyer for the plaintiffs in the case, expressed disapproval at Karpeles' decision, saying anyone seeking protection from US courts should be prepared to enter the country to justify such protection in person.

42374528,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvlCrj,1396177230,"Make Your Own Cash, 1930s Style; the CoinSummit Boosters; and Hot Pockets","Welcome to the CoinDesk Weekly Review 28th March 2014 – a regular look at the hottest, most thought-provoking and most controversial events in the world of digital currency through the eyes of scepticism and wonder.  Your host … John Law.  Unterguggenbergercoin - your time has come  Iceland is an odd place. The only neutral country invaded in World War II by the British, who were terribly apologetic about it, it has Bjork, sagas, NSFW necropants, and hakarl, a local snack made by fermenting urea-saturated shark meat in a hole in the ground for a few weeks. By repute, it tastes worse than it sounds.  It’s also had some remarkable fiscal adventures, which have led to a generally low opinion of corporate finance. Thus, it is a fitting home for auroracoin, the first experiment in a national cybercurrency. First indications are that it’s off to a rocky start with few Icelanders taking up their free allocation, and a rapid drop in value against bitcoin.  Yet these are early days, and other putative national altcoins such as Scotcoin, are looking on with interest. In such projects, a large number of coins are created and issued before mining (if any) takes place; in this respect, as in many others, such ideas are most similar to local or community currencies.  Here, a group prints up some pseudo-banknotes and encourages their use in local shops, to pay for hired help on small jobs, and to support local charities. The idea is to encourage the local economy, and they’re particularly popular in the UK where some 400 similar projects are underway.  However, they can have more profound effects. One almost-forgotten experiment, which John Law finds most intriguing, became known as the Miracle of Wörgl.  Wörgl is a small town in Austria. In 1932, weathering the global depression, it had around thirty percent unemployment and 200 destitute families. It also had 40,000 schillings in the bank.  Mayor Michael Unterguggenberger had a list even longer than his name of civic projects he wanted to fund but the money to hand wouldn’t begin to cover the costs of one of them. Yet he had a workforce standing idle.  So, he created a local currency. He put the money in a bank and used it to guarantee the issuance of a large number of local banknotes that had one special feature. Every month, to stay valid, they had to have a stamp attached – which cost one percent of the value of the note. In other words, the money deflated in value automatically, every month, by one percent. He spent the lot of this stamp scrip on the first of his projects.  The result was spectacular. People became highly motivated to spend the money as quickly as possible. They paid their taxes early, passing money back to be issued in new projects.  As more and more work was done, such as planting trees, stuff was generated that could be traded outside the currency zone. Mayor Michael got his projects – roads repaired, mains water supplied, bridges built – and more. It’s estimated that each of the stamp scrip schillings generated more than ten times the amount of employment than the government fiat currency circulating alongside. And the local economy was otherwise remarkably stable – the rapidly circulating money didn’t cause price rises.  People took notice. Surrounding villages adopted similar schemes. Economists flocked in, and the Mayor become a celebrity. With some 400 other areas getting interested, the national bank took fright and banned the idea – and Austria tried another form of national salvation, with less savoury results.  There are many ways in which the local conditions helped the experiment to flourish; the local economy was much more localised than it is today, and levels of despair were much higher. Other deflationary economies have been marked by long periods of stagnation and productivity decline.  But John Law highly recommends others more astute than he take a long look at Michael Unterguggenberger’s remarkable feat, and in the cybercurrency zeitgeist now afoot take another crack at it on the back of a local currency experiment.  If someone does, John Law will fly to Iceland and eat one piece of hakarl for every letter in the Mayor’s last name. Now that should be profoundly deflationary.  Californian dreamers get down to work  The CoinSummit San Francisco event over the past few days was profoundly optimistic – some might say irrationally so, given the latest half-rumour/half-news that China has slapped bitcoin down yet again.  That’s the trouble with Chinese bans – a month after you’ve had one, you need another. And, to be fair, it’s unlikely that a Californian conference about new technology is going to be overburdened with pessimism.  What was notable about CoinSummit, though, was how little time was devoted to bitcoin itself, at least in its current febrile state. Instead, most discussions centred around generic problems of adoption, the whole altcoin scene, the state of official acceptance of cryptocurrencies in general, and – most significantly – what sort of ecosystem is growing up around the technologies and what new directions it may take.  There were a lot of grown-ups there, too, some, like Marc Andreessen, positively revelling in the prospect that the wilder fringes of bitcoin fanaticism were being driven away in disgust from the onslaught of suits (well, smart casual).  There was a sense of confidence in cybercurrency’s robustness, after a tumultuous period where bitcoin bogeymen such as black-market trading, fraudulent companies and official condemnation had been largely despatched. Time to get on with business.  John Law recommends that if you have a spare half-hour and want to recalibrate your sense of what’s worth thinking about as 2014 unfolds, you could do far worse than take a virtual trip to San Francisco and read through the reports.  Don’t put too many flowers in your hair – the city’s been the home of failed cultural revolutions in the past – but you’ll end up far better informed than 95 percent of the Internet.  Phoney miners  Is your Android phone burning through battery life? Is it sluggish and unwilling to be your friend? You could have secret mining software, unwittingly installed alongside an apparently legitimate app. But, to be honest, you probably don’t.  There was a mild flutter this week with the revelation that a couple of apps from Google’s Play store have been found to have malware miners, ostensibly taking over your phone to create bitcoin for some secret villains.  These follow a tradition almost as old as bitcoin itself, of people slipping in such software where no software ought to be. Universities, gaming networks and Linux users have all been hit in the past; there’s even one variant targeting gadgets such as home routers and smart TVs.  But the flutter soon died down. Google quickly takes down – and can forcibly de-install – Play store apps that break the rules, and only a couple of apps had the malware. And besides, the sages say, phones are far too weedy to mine. If you need banks of custom ASICs running for days to see any return, what can a Samsung do?  This set John Law thinking. A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that a modern quad-core phone can probably manage around 1 MHash/s if you don’t mind it getting hot and having the battery life of a mayfly on crystal meth, or just running while the thing’s charging.  At the current difficulty level, that would generate one bitcoin per 28,000 years – if you want to calculate the effect of bitcoin’s ever-increasing difficulty rate to find a real number, knock yourself out.  That does indeed seem a poor use of your mobile phone, even if you upgrade every two years. But does that mean you can’t mine anything with your phone? Not at all. Other altcoins have much lower hashrate requirements, or use other proofs of work altogether. There’s no reason why a mobile phone only altcoin couldn’t be created, with all the parameters tweaked to have reasonable behaviour on such limited resources.  It’d take a bit of extra smarts to stop people building mining rigs that merely pretended to be phones, but the phone system has been created to prevent fraud and enforce identity so the network has the requisite tools.  Just because you can do something, doesn’t mean you should – a lesson John Law may not quite have learned yet – but the idea of a mobile-only cash ecosystem may open up more efficient in-game purchases, or a way to stop phone spam by charging for received texts or calls from unknown numbers.  On the whole, though, it would probably just encourage malware and burned hands. One experiment we can all probably live without. Unless you plan on living to the year 30,014.

42425590,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIZFTh,1396172860,Hullcoin: The World's First Local Government Cryptocurrency?,"A forum at Hull City Council in the UK this month saw the launch of the very first UK local government operated cryptocurrency, dubbed HullCoin.  The reason for this unprecedented technological act of local government is to tackle poverty, the council says, making it arguably the most worthy use of a cryptocurrency yet.  Why local currencies?  Hull, or Kingston Upon Hull to give it its full title, is one of many cities across the UK that has suffered due to the national recession and the coalition government's welfare reforms. This in turn has led to a large increase in the number of people living in financial poverty.  Local currency projects have been set up before in many countries, and are indeed still in proliferating. In many cases, they have been used to protect local businesses by creating a system whereby money stays within a local economy and is not spent with larger companies that do not return investment into those areas.  CoinDesk recently reported on one such example, the Brixton Pound. Other examples in the UK include Bristol, Stroud, Lewes, and Totnes, and there are many others. However, none of those currencies are digital currencies, nor are they aimed directly at social justice or poverty.  Going crypto  In the case of Hull City Council, Dave Shepherdson the Financial Inclusion Support Officer, explained to me that previous local currencies were treated as loss leaders. In the case of HullCoin, mining a cryptocurrency actually works as a way to add value to the local economy.  The idea to use cryptocurrency came about when Shepherdson was asked by the Hull City Council Welfare Rights Manager, Lisa Bovill, to investigate the possibility of using an alternative currency (in the sense of the Brixton Pound-type of local currencies) as a means to provide an anti-poverty framework in Hull.  This was to be part of the 'Hull People Premium' scheme, aimed to help the people of Hull save money, and gain access to advice and aid for food, fuel and finance.  Said Shepherdson:  ""It’s about people on low incomes, in financial distress, being able to subsidize to an extent and compliment their incomes through undertaking activities that will be linked to the things in field of finance. [Futhermore] it can be used to instigate voluntary activity, or it can be issued close to the point of demand for a service which would help them, which they would not normally have the ability to pay for.""  When it came to the possibility of using cryptocurrencies as a means to do this, ""we saw potentially quite a lot of value in it, in its demographic, how it can be generated through the mining process,"" said Shepherdson. ""And that we then could have the ability to build a distribution framework around it through partnership organisations that we work with, which will create additional value in the local economy through the exchange rate that it has with sterling.""  HullCoin takes shape  Lisa Bovill said that the team spent some time calculating whether mining a cryptocurrency would be worthwhile and found that they could make it a profitable scheme.  She added:  ""A digital local currency is the unique idea, and it will help with the distribution if you could link digital currency with the local currency.""  While the scheme is in its early days, Hull City Council are actively mining. Its GPU mining rig is based on two Sapphire R9 290X graphics cards, and the project's technical expert, Craig Chamberlain, said that the machine is running at 1.6 MH/sec.  The money for this equipment did not come from tax payer funds. Rather, it was a donation from an unnamed benefactor who supplied the money with the stipulation that it must be used in a way to help the people of Hull.  They have aspirations beyond their current mining equipment too. Said Shepherdson:  ""We would love to be able to get something like a KnC mining rig installed where we can actually really start to generate a lot of currency and really get out there. [Then], as the currency matures, we can extend, so people can pay their rents and utilities, [or] pay for food through this sort of service. But at the moment it is small scale pilot.""  As altcoins go, HullCoin is different: it is a hybrid of two currencies. While the mining rig is generating scrypt-based currencies, HullCoins will be a 50:50 mixture of Feathercoin and Ven.  Shepherdson explained:  ""Obviously, digital currency is very volatile and the volatility is something which we will need to monitor, and [...] while strategizing that volatility, we came across something which is called Ven. It is digital and it isn’t pegged to a particular currency. Ven is something which has a small value but is pegged to a basket commodity, like gold. Whilst it doesn’t create a great deal of value, it is incredibly stable. So, you build that stability into your local currency.""  Cryptocurrency for social justice  The way in which the Hull City Council team plans to make use of HullCoin is through a 'time banking' type of scheme. Hull residents in financial distress can take part in voluntary activities and receive HullCoins in exchange.  Kathryn Sowerby, Hull City Council's Social Policy Officer, confirmed to me that receipt of HullCoins will not affect people's benefits because cryptocurrencies are not yet recognised as actual currency in UK law, or in the eyes of the Department of Works and Pensions (DWP).  Said Shepherdson:    ""We are going to be inviting organisations to identify activities that will qualify for payment and then we are going to set on those rates of pay. Though that could be volunteering, for example, it could be at the point of crisis intervention.      We have agreed to take HullCoin in the Hull food bank, so if someone presents themselves for a food parcel, we will be able to print them a wallet number, and we will then issue them with the equivalent of three free hot meals through a network of community cafes. We will be able to turn their food parcel into hot meals through issuing a digital currency – that is where the value is created.""    The official launch of HullCoin was held at the Hull Financial Inclusion forum, held on March 7th. The HullCoin team and members of the Feathercoin project gave talks to an audience of representatives of Hull-based companies and non-profit organisations.  Many of the audience were hearing about cryptocurrencies for the first time, and inevitably there were complaints that it was far too complicated.  However, after discussion between attendees and speakers, there was a surprising turn around in opinion. By the end of the forum, there were many who became enthusiastic and were coming up with their own ideas for the potential uses of cryptocurrencies.  In the long term, Hull City Council team foresees HullCoin going beyond anti-poverty uses. It was even revealed by Lisa Bovill that a 'Hull Bank' for the city's currency was a long term goal.  Whether or not the HullCoin project achieves its goal, it should be noted that this is the first time a UK local government has adopted the use of cryptocurrency.  In a wider context, this a rare instance of cryptocurrencies being used to tackle the issue of social justice – surely a much more worthwhile use of digital currencies than idle speculation on market margins?",POSITIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BTC | FIAT | MINING | ZRX,David Gilson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/30/hullcoin-the-worlds-first-local-government-cryptocurrency,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ee5741a11415f364046b9e7570620e1ab898740f-1000x625.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425585,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIZFPh,1396166989,"The Death of Windows XP Won't Kill the ATM Industry, or Help Bitcoin","Microsoft is planning to cut off support for Windows XP next month, but the move won't have the major impact on the ATM industry that many pundits believe.  And contrary to what some bitcoiners say, it won't do anything to help the bitcoin economy of the fledgling bitcoin ATM industry, either.  Official support for Windows XP is set to end on 8th April, which has prompted many commentators to conclude that the ATM industry will be in a world of trouble as soon as the clock hits midnight. In some respects this echoes the 'Millennium bug' (Y2K) fear, uncertainty and doubt that spread 15 years ago as the year 2000 approached.  These statements also happen to be just as spectacularly wrong as the Y2K scaremongering. While the move by Microsoft is a nuisance and is already causing some problems for ATM operators, the impact of the decision has been greatly exaggerated.  What will really happen  Here are the facts. Microsoft is going to end support for Windows XP on 8th April. This is not exactly an unexpected decision, Microsoft has delayed cutting off support for a while. In addition, it will not cut support entirely. It will still offer anti-malware updates, although security updates will stop.  Approximately 95% of all ATMs run Windows XP and it is estimated that more than 60% of these will keep running the OS after the cut-off date. However, these worrisome statistics do not paint the full picture.  It is important to understand that ATMs run different versions of Windows XP, and a sizeable number run stripped-down, embedded versions of the operating system. Microsoft is not ending support for embedded XP – support for these units will continue well into 2016.  It is also possible that ATM operators with non-embedded versions will get a temporary reprieve. The fact that Microsoft will end support for consumer products does not necessarily mean that ATM operators don't have contingency plans that involve an extension of official support past the April deadline.  The logical upgrade path would require many ATMs to move to Windows 7, which might not be practical for some operators due to hardware compatibility problems or financial concerns. Effectively, it would mess up their hardware upgrade timetable and cost them money.  Compliance requirements  ATMs need to meet Payment Card Industry Security Standards (PCI SSC) in order to get a green light. Microsoft has said XP users will be considered ""unprotected"" after it cuts off support next month.  However, that's just part of the story. In fact, Windows XP ATMs will still be able to meet the requirements even without a new OS. The industry had plenty of time to prepare for the cut-off.  The PCI SSC clearly states that Windows XP devices will be able to meet its standards after the cut-off, provided their operators make the necessary adjustments. In essence, ATM operators will know what to do when the time comes, as they had plenty of time to prepare.  [post-quote]  Even regular consumers and small businesses don't need to be overly concerned. Lack of official support does not mean that XP boxes will turn into malware-ridden botnet zombies overnight. Apart from the promised official anti-malware releases, security firms will also be offering vendors third-party protection.  Malwarebytes has launched an updated version of its Anti-Malware Premium suite this week, and the company says it will support XP users for life. As many as 20% of Malwarebyte users are still running XP.  Coincidentally, the company recently got a bit of love from the cryptocurrecncy community, after it started accepting bitcoin for its products.  Alternatives to XP  As pointed out, Microsoft's decision to cut support for Windows XP has messed up ATM upgrade timetables. But if an ATM operator has a unit that currently runs XP, but for some reason it cannot be upgraded to Windows 7, there are a number of alternatives.  One is, of course, to patch XP and ensure compliance without Microsoft. This is possible, in theory, although the solution is neither simple nor elegant.  The second alternative is to go for an alternative OS altogether.  This is not as farfetched as it sounds: Linux has a much smaller footprint than Windows 7 and, as a result, some ATM operators are considering a switch to Linux rather than the Microsoft product.  This would not be the first time ATMs have transitioned to a different OS. Before the industry moved to XP, most ATM's were running IBM's OS/2 operating system.  Money talks  It's a matter of economics, not tech. As Computerworld points out, a new ATM costs $15,000-$60,000 and the typical lifecycle is seven to 10 years. This explains why some operators are reluctant to upgrade their hardware – it just doesn't make financial sense.  The bottom line is: don't buy into the hype or fall for the FUD. Come April 9th, your local ATM will still spit out cash.  Over the next few months, many ATMs will get a new operating system, or tweaks to the old one, that will enable them to meet compliance standards until they are replaced or upgraded. The vast majority of people won't notice a thing, apart from a nicer user interface on their local ATM.  People who think most ATMs will simply die without official support are probably the same people who bought into the Y2K hype all those years ago. Besides, even if they did, it wouldn't have much of an effect on digital currencies and bitcoin ATMs. That's a case of wishful thinking and nothing more.  What's more, the fact that bitcoin ATMs are manufactured by small outfits means that in the long run could be in an even worse situation, as small companies don't tend to offer much in the way of long-term software support.  They simply lack the resources and, in many cases, startups in niche industries don't survive. That is not a concern for the time being, since bitcoin ATMs are practically brand new.  However, imagine a world with tens of thousands of unstandardised bitcoin ATMs, produced by dozens of companies over the course of a decade or so?
