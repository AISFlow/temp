The promotion of the token sale for the Hubii Network, which is developing a blockchain-based content marketplace, comes days before he is set to fight Conor McGregor in a much-billed fight this weekend.  Dubbing himself ""Floyd Crypto Mayweather"" in both an Instagram post and the tweet, the boxer even hinted at an ongoing promotion effort with the hash tag ""#CryptoMediaGroup"" without elaborating.  A representative for Mayweather did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, this isn't Mayweather's first foray into the cryptocurrency space (nor does it seem to be his last). In late July, Mayweather promoted the ICO for the Stox project in a post on Instagram. Stox went on to raise more than $30 million in its token sale.

The financing for MGT Capital came as a result of a 10 percent convertible note issued to a firm called UAHC Ventures LLC. The funding, according to statements, will be used to expand MGT's bitcoin mining operations in the northwest US, where plentiful hydropower has attracted more than a few miners.  Bitcoin mining is an energy intensive process by which new transactions are added to the blockchain, with new coins being created as a reward for the miner that creates the next transaction block. Profits are earned when the proceeds of mining exceed the cost of electricity and other resources.  The company's leadership team includes John McAfee, who founded the eponymous anti-virus software firm in the late 1980s. Intel went on to buy that company in 2010 for $7.6 billion.  In addition to mining bitcoin, MGT mines ethereum and ethereum classic, and is also developing cybersecurity products including a privacy-oriented phone.  In past statements to the media, McAfee has struck a bullish tone on the prospects of his bitcoin mine, telling Bloomberg in a May interview that ""we will definitely be profitable before the end of the year."" He also recently pushed back against arguments that the bitcoin market is in bubble territory.

42379798,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KlwH,1503512677,SegWit Goes Live: Why Bitcoin's Big Upgrade Is a Blockchain Game-Changer,"Block 481,824.  That's when Segregated Witness (SegWit) will activate on bitcoin late today or tomorrow morning, bringing the years-long debate over the contentious code upgrade to an official close. At that time, users will finally be able to take advantage of the long-promised technology.  Looking back, it's important to note how long the change – perhaps the biggest ever made to the bitcoin software – has taken. To start, the community has been embroiled in politics since SegWit was first proposed in 2015 by Bitcoin Core contributor Pieter Wuille as a possible ""compromise"" to the scaling debate.  Since then, there's been no shortage of drama – mining firm Bitmain was accused of blocking SegWit in order to boost its revenue; major bitcoin companies and mining pools united behind their own scaling plan; and finally, unhappy with the plan, users equipped with GIFs and branded hats responded with a kind of revolt.  And that's not even the half of it.  But with SegWit soon to be guaranteed, today marks the first day it will be usable on bitcoin. Here are the key things that SegWit enables:  It rearranges how data is stored in bitcoin blocks.  It boosts capacity while remaining compatible with past versions of the software.  It removes transaction malleability, a bug that's been the primary roadblock for many bitcoin projects.  Eliminating the roadblock  The final point is what might have the most lasting impact.  Indeed, many developers believe SegWit will boost the development of more forward-looking technologies necessary for bitcoin's mainstream use.  The best known is the Lightning Network, first proposed in a 2015 white paper by Joseph Poon and Tadge Dryja. The idea is payment channels that move transactions off the blockchain could boost bitcoin's capacity to millions of transactions per second.  But the project has grown in scope considerably since its 2015 ideation.  Working under the assumption that SegWit would eventually activate on bitcoin, a handful of developers have built active Lightning Network implementations, and they're now working to ensure that all of them work with one another.  And, since the Lightning Network is now possible on two major cryptocurrencies – bitcoin and litecoin – developers are also planning on using the network to create a new type of trustless trading between the two. It's also possible that these tools could potentially eradicate the need for cryptocurrency exchanges, which have been under scrutiny recently for messing up at the expense of cryptocurrency users.  And other projects that need, or at the least, work better with SegWit capability are well underway, too.  Developers preparing for SegWit activation have been working on MAST (which enables more complex bitcoin smart contracts), schnorr signatures (which would enable another transaction capacity boost) and TumbleBit (an anonymous top-layer network).  Continuing politics  And while SegWit looks to enable a bright future for bitcoin, it doesn't exactly bring an end to the debate and politics that have mired the community for years.  Some bitcoin users still believe SegWit is the wrong choice, and they're so adamant about this that they forked the bitcoin blockchain (creating a new version entirely). Called bitcoin cash, the blockchain eliminates SegWit in favor of other scaling tech.  Now, bitcoin and bitcoin cash are competing, putting two ideologies to the test – with real money on the line.  The questions being asked now are: Which cryptocurrency has the best technical roadmap? Which will attract the most users and attention? And which will remain the most decentralized? Or, do both of them have merit?  While answers to those questions are uncertain, one thing is for sure. With SegWit activating today, the community is one step closer to determining whether it's scaling capabilities are all they were touted as.

Reuters  reports that Fosun Group is investing in Shanghai Distributed Technologies Co Ltd, the company behind the Onchain blockchain project.  Founded in the 1990s, Fosun has become a major force in China's finance space. Among its listed investments include stakes in Cirque du Soleil and Club Med. Fosun also has operations in the mining, insurance and technology sectors, among others.  It's not immediately clear how much of a stake was purchased, but according to the report, the amount is worth ""tens of millions of yuan"" per a Fosun official. The conglomerate is the sole investor in this particular funding round.  Onchain, a start-up that utilizes an open-source distributed network architecture (DNA), previously developed the public blockchain network NEO. Formerly known as Antshares, NEO raised more than more than $4.5 million in an initial coin offering (ICO) last fall.  The startup is aiming to create a ""universal platform"" built on the tech.

42379809,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KmBN,1503506713,Chasing Profit? Bitcoin Miners Swap Networks As Difficulty Swings,"Since bitcoin cash split from the bitcoin blockchain, miners have had a choice: which of two blockchains to mine?  At play in their considerations are two factors: ideology and profitability. But while it's possible some miners are choosing bitcoin or bitcoin cash based on preference, a certain contingent seem to be following the money.  How do we know? At block 481,824 yesterday, the bitcoin cash blockchain saw a notable difficulty adjustment.  At the time, blocks were being found on bitcoin cash at a rate of about one 1-2 minutes, or less. As a result, the difficulty went up by 300%, the maximum allowed under the difficulty adjustment rules.  Both bitcoin and bitcoin cash adjust difficulty downward every 2,016 blocks, though in the case of bitcoin cash, the length of time this takes varies depending on how long it takes blocks to be discovered. If the previous 2,016 blocks took less than two weeks, difficulty goes up, if more than two weeks, difficulty goes down.  Changing the dynamic between the chains is that because of this unique rule and yesterday's change, bitcoin cash is now much less profitable to mine than bitcoin.  And miners seem to be responding, as a lot of mining hash power seems to have left bitcoin cash and moved to bitcoin. At its peak, bitcoin cash had 44% of all hash power compared to bitcoin's 56%.  As of this writing, BCH has about 26% compared to BTC's 74%, according to data from fork.lol, a data site that has sprung up to cover the narrative.  As of this writing, bitcoin is averaging slightly less than six blocks per hour over the last eight hours, while bitcoin cash is averaging a little over one block per hour in the same time period.  The next difficulty adjustment on either chain is expected to be when bitcoin hits block 481,824, on August 24.

42379800,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Km2Z,1503499780,Congressional Candidate Now Accepting Bitcoin Donations for 2018 Election,"A candidate for the US House of Representatives said today that he has begun accepting bitcoin donations.  Patrick Nelson is running for the seat in New York’s 21st Congressional District. According to a report in February from regional newspaper The Times Union, Nelson filed to run in January.  A Bernie Sanders supporter and a former staffer in the New York State Legislature, Nelson is advancing a progressive campaign plan ahead of the election in November 2018. He is one of three candidates seeking the Democratic nomination, public records show.  In statements, Nelson, who is taking contributions through payment processor BitPay, echoed that forward-looking agenda when announcing the move to accept donations in bitcoin. Nelson took donations in bitcoin for a previous campaign, when he unsuccessfully ran for a seat on the Stillwater Town Council in 2015.  ""Our goal in this campaign has been and continues to be bringing 21st Century policies to the 21st District,"" Nelson said. ""That means we embrace innovation and new technologies like the blockchain and bitcoin.""  The US government gave its approval for political campaigns to accepting donations in 2014 when the Federal Elections Commission (FEC) outlined the rules for doing so.  A contribution in bitcoin – which currently has a cap of $100 per donor – is considered as a form of ""in-kind"" donation, by which people can give valuable assets to a campaign that may later be sold. Once sold, campaigns have 10 days to put the proceeds generate into their official campaign depository.  Other candidates for public office in the US have accepted bitcoin donations in past election cycles. These include Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, who made waves when he started taking contributions in the cryptocurrency during the 2016 presidential election.  Yet as previous reported by CoinDesk, the FEC is considering whether to change its rules on bitcoin donations. During a meeting last September, commissioners began discussing whether to treat bitcoin like cash.

42379827,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KmCd,1503493202,Bitcoin Prices Are Up Over $100 Already Today,"The average price of bitcoin across global exchanges is trending up, having already climbed over $100 during today's trading.  At press time, bitcoin prices were trading around $4,265, a figure that was up nearly $130 from the day's open of $4,137. The uptick, while slight in comparison to the cryptocurrency's 300% appreciation in 2017, nonetheless comes during a period in which bitcoin has had difficulty building support above $4,000.  Over the last seven days, bitcoin has dipped below $4,000 several times, most recently during August 22's trading session.  Overall, bitcoin appears to be settling into a period of sideways trading after rising 55% over the last month and nearly 90% over the last three months, according to data provider CoinMarketCap. By contrast, this week, bitcoin is up only 2.3%.  As such, it remains to be seen whether the market lull is merely a pause in the rally, or a broader sign of potential fatigue in the nascent asset class.  Suggesting the former is that the increase also coincided with a broader movement of capital into alternative cryptocurrencies, with the value of the entire asset class reaching an all-time high of more than $150 billion earlier today.  $100 bill image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2017/08/23/bitcoin-prices-are-up-over-100-already-today,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0b9af0401fb99ff7b64673ff66096b91d917f127-1500x845.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Now, to help meet that rapidly increasing demand, IBM is partnering with Baruch College, Fordham University, University of Arkansas, University at Buffalo and the University of British Columbia to establish a series of grants, design blockchain curricula and more.  In addition, IBM has added new blockchain resources to it's IBM Academic Initiative, an ambitious effort that opens resources from the global tech giant to 1,000 universities.

42427727,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL39fh,1503487870,$150 Billion: Total Cryptocurrency Market Cap Hits New All-Time High,"The combined value of all publicly traded cryptocurrencies has set a new record, surpassing $150 billion for the first time today.  At press time, the value of ether, bitcoin and more than 800 other blockchain-based assets had reached a high of around $154 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.  Overall, the figure indicates that the cryptocurrency market continues to grow at a steady pace. At $154 billion, the market is up 13 percent over the last seven days, 67 percent over the last month and an astounding 1,240 percent year-over-year.

42427713,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL39Fh,1503486014,Silicon Blockchain: Intel's Distributed Ledger Strategy Is All About Hardware,"In the age of advanced blockchain software, some companies are turning to something more familiar in their search for security and scalability – microchips made from melted sand.  Far from a startup-led or open-source movement, at the forefront of this push to bring distributed ledger technology back within centralized processing units is none other than Intel, the $170 billion computer chip manufacturer that's also one of Silicon Valley's biggest success stories.  In fact, since 2014, Intel has been hard at work seeking to find ways to both solve blockchain's big problems and play to its own strengths, and hardware is proving essential to this strategy. While that's not exactly a secret, it's nonetheless a vision the company has certainly become less open in evangelizing.  That, however, may be changing.  In a new conversation with CoinDesk, Ricardo Echevarria, vice president of Intel's software and services group, opened up about his company's approach, explaining why Intel moved from early experiments with cryptocurrencies to designing enterprise-grade blockchain solutions powered by its existing technology.  He told CoinDesk:  ""This is a place where we're threading the needle with scalability, security and privacy, and removing some of the most challenging technical barriers to the deployment of blockchain.""  The long game  Speaking at a Microsoft press event earlier this month, Echevarria provided new context to Intel's approach, talking broadly about the problems the company identified in the blockchain industry and the reasons it charted its unique course.  Going back to its earliest experiments, Echevarria stressed that Intel saw hardware as a way to improve two major weak points with the technology and its implementation: trust and security.  ""Every time somebody hacks a wallet, or every time you start engaging in debates over which bitcoin exchange versus the other [is more secure] ... it just doesn’t give people confidence this is something they can trust their business with,"" Echevarria said at the event.  So, rather than work with existing open-source software, Intel created its own.  And it started in the place where many other blockchain networks began, by focusing on how participants running the protocol would achieve trust.  While most public blockchains rely on the time- and energy-intensive ""proof-of-work"" consensus algorithm, Intel took a different tact, choosing to point customers back to hardware.  Called ""proof of elapsed time,"" the algorithm was designed to run on Intel chips through the use of software guard extensions (SGXs) – sets of instructions that create enclaves for important data within the hardware.  Launching use cases  But, that's not to say Intel has taken a closed approach.  While its SGX technology is proprietary, the blockchain software that grew out of its experiments is not, and has since been open-sourced as the Hyperledger Sawtooth code base.  Yet, Echevarria still sees the use of SGX as essential to its strategy – framing it as a way to ensure information that runs inside it is both encrypted and ""only accessible to the application.""  ""There's no operating system lower in the stack that can access what's inside of that enclave,"" he said.  If security was initially an advertised benefit, though, Echevarria contends the idea has produced further fruit. Through the use of SGX, he said Intel has been able to significantly accelerate transaction times.  And work to demonstrate this continues in proofs-of-concept in which other companies are testing the waters by combining software and hardware.  Notably, the latter use case, which came in the form of a partnership with blockchain healthcare startup PokitDok, integrates a hardware component, using Hyperledger Sawtooth and SGX as a route to better secure and protect health records.  Hardware on trend  However, Intel is not the only player seeking to position its hardware as essential for blockchain development.  Earlier this year, tech consultancy Accenture integrated the Thale's hardware security module (HSM) in an effort to end the debate in enterprise circles over blockchain's security loopholes. And IBM offers users of its High Security Business Network access to its HSM too.  Not everyone agrees hardware solutions will solve blockchain's security problems, though. Microsoft itself touted its software-based trusted execution environments (TEEs) at the same launch where Echevarria was discussing Intel's hardware-based strategy.  But if there's competition, Echevarria seemed unfazed, seeing Microsoft's launch as a way to get more enterprise interest in everyone's projects.  In interview Echevarria said:  ""[Blockchain] is going to be very important to businesses. We're well positioned to help accelerate it, and that's going to be our intent.""

Groepe's comments come almost a year to the day after the South African Reserve Bank indicated that it would adopt an open perspective on the tech – even leaving the door open to applications of its own.  ""We are willing to consider the merits and risks of blockchain technology and other distributed ledgers,"" the bank's governor, Lesetja Kganyago, said at the time.  Other major financial players in the country, including its central securities depository, have also moved to investigate possible uses of blockchain.

42427719,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL39Ph,1503475207,Lightning's Tadge Dryja is Working On a Bitcoin Cash 'Splitter',"Lightning Network creator Tadge Dryja is developing an experimental tool he hopes will help bitcoin users safely claim their newly created bitcoin cash.  To recap, on August 1, a group of users and mining pools who didn't agree with bitcoin's technical direction split off to create a new cryptocurrency, bitcoin cash, in the hopes of winning over users. And because of the way it ""forked"" from the blockchain, most users of bitcoin at the time are now left with an equal amount of bitcoin cash, and those funds are tied to their existing wallets.  Free cryptocurrency. Sounds great, right? The bad part is that forks open the possibility of ""replay attacks,"" where transactions on one chain are duplicated on the other, and which have lost users' funds in the past.  And though bitcoin cash is touted as being able to tackle this problem in a safe way, Dryja has concerns about the software that highlight the politics and mistrust still in the air following the fork.  ""I don't want to run BCH [bitcoin cash] software as I don't trust the people writing it,"" he told CoinDesk.  His in-progress tool, called Goodelivery, is aimed to give users another option for safely splitting off the bitcoin cash tokens and moving them elsewhere – say to a new address or to an exchange to trade. However, he doesn't recommend that users make real transactions with it just yet.  Dryja went on to say that the other reason for Goodeliver is that he doesn't see it as a one-time-only tool. Since bitcoin cash has had ""relative success"" in spinning up a new network, he expects the new coin could inspire other future forks, especially now that its proven it's possible to make money from such splits.  Despite building Goodeliver to help users, though, Dryja said he's not a supporter of forks like the one that produced bitcoin cash:  ""I view the current crop of hard forks as attacks on bitcoin and the concept of decentralized currency in general. It's hard to argue to skeptics that bitcoin can have any value or scarcity if anyone can just duplicate it and double the number of coins in existence.""
