42377608,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX72Qyf,1410386405,Coinbase Launches Bitcoin Buying and Selling in 13 European Countries,"Coinbase has announced its first expansion beyond the US market, launching bitcoin buying and selling services in 13 countries across Europe.  With the beta launch, Coinbase will now allow consumers in Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Finland, France, Greece, Italy, Latvia, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia and Spain to buy and sell up to €500 in bitcoin per day.  Speaking to CoinDesk, CEO and co-founder Brian Armstrong framed Coinbase's European market entrance as the natural next step for his business, which now boasts more than 1.6 million wallet users in the US as well as a host of billion-dollar US businesses that now use its merchant services, including Dell, Expedia and Overstock.  Armstrong told CoinDesk:  ""We looked at what markets to move into next, and Europe seemed like the next biggest economy. It's developed, there are people there who want to get bitcoin, there's a lot of demand for it, but they really don't have an easy way to do it.""  Though a big step for the Andreessen Horowitz-backed company, Armstrong also sought to frame Coinbase's expansion as a boon for the broader bitcoin industry, citing its expanded reach as an enabler of cross-border payment and new remittance products.  ""These are the kinds of things that will start to unlock once we build this kind of infrastructure in each country,"" Armstrong added.  The news marks the second major announcement this week for the California-based bitcoin services provider. On 8th September, Coinbase revealed a new partnership with eBay-owned PayPal subsidiary Braintree that will expand bitcoin acceptance to more merchants, potentially including big brands such as LivingSocial, TaskRabbit and Uber as well as Armstrong's former employer Airbnb.  The next step in remittance  Throughout the interview, Armstrong sought to position Coinbase's expanded service as one that will help enable ""bitcoin's killer use case"", remittances.  Armstrong suggested he sees Coinbase as having no direct competitors in the European bitcoin market, in part, because of the larger vision the entire community is working toward and the combined effort it will take to achieve.  Citing the historical challenges faced by technology startups when attacking large financial incumbents such as American Express, MasterCard and Western Union, Armstrong said:  ""It has been impossible before this for any individual company to tackle the big incumbents because of the amount of capital required to compete with them at a global scale. Even Facebook tried to do it with Facebook Credits, but I think bitcoin will win because it is that open network.""  With the expansion, Armstrong also hopes to encourage other businesses to build on his work, even as he pledged to expand Coinbase into more European countries.  ""I want there to be 100 entrepreneurs in each of these countries, someone there with local relationships who will get a bank deal done and launch some version of it that will help the whole ecosystem grow,"" Armstrong added.  Merchants services to follow  Coinbase's wallet service has long been available in Europe to bitcoin holders, but the announcement marks the company's formal entrance into the market by expanding its core offering – bitcoin brokerage services – into the region.  Though Armstrong stopped short of saying that Coinbase would begin seeking out merchant partners in Europe, he cited it as a service that could already be used for this purpose, saying:  ""Obviously, merchants need the ability to cash out if they don't want to hold bitcoin. So, those are the services that have now been turned on as a result of this launch.""  Coinbase's largest rival in the US market, BitPay, is currently offering merchant services to the European market, and recently expanded into a new, 2,500 square-foot office.  The company aims to enroll as much as 40,000 European merchants by the year's end and is competing against smaller competitors including Bitmarket.lt and SpectroCoin.  Igniting the European market  Though BitPay has sought to paint the European market as being subject to different needs and forces than the US, Armstrong took a different approach, expressing optimism that Coinbase could replicate its success in the US abroad.  Armstrong framed his company's buying and selling services as the seeds that will allow Coinbase's services to blossom in the region, asserting his belief that this was the initial spark that lead to greater bitcoin awareness in the US.  Armstrong told CoinDesk:  ""We haven't seen that kind of merchant adoption in Europe yet, and I think the reason is that there's just still not as many consumers have an easy way to get a little bit of bitcoin.""  Unsurprisingly, Armstrong cited awareness as his company's biggest obstacle, though he suggested that by entering the market and creating more excitement around bitcoin, Europe's market could follow a similar trajectory.  He explained:  ""In the US, it reached a saturation point where you heard about bitcoin three times in a month and then made an effort to get educated and buy a little bit. I suppose in Europe, they're exposed to a lot of the same press, but they haven't had that ability.""  Planning the expansion  For the expansion, Armstrong said that Coinbase reached out to a number of countries in the region, writing letters and engaging local regulators in dialogue about its ability to extend its services to their jurisdictions.  Countries were then given the greenlight based on how favorably they responded to this outreach, and how specific their regulatory requirements were for bitcoin businesses.  Armstrong said:  ""We reached out to each country in that region on a case-by-case basis. It was a lot of bank partnerships, a lot of legal and compliance work and some technical integration as well.""  Armstrong did not reveal Coinbase's banking partner, but did suggest that multiple partnerships could be supporting the expansion.  ""You don't actually need one in each country, because we're using the SEPA network. But, you need at least one, and ideally more than one, so that's what we spent a bunch of time doing,"" he said.  Long road ahead  While the beta launch is an exciting step for the company, Armstrong framed the service introduction as just the first leg in much longer journey to to ensure that its brand takes root in the region.  Armstrong noted that Coinbase has begun the process of 'internationalizing' its website, but that this feature is not yet available. He said:  ""These are the sort of things where localizing a website can take years to get right. There's lots of little details where you have a person in another country they'll come to a website and there's some subtle thing that gives it away as an American website that's translated.""  The CEO went on to suggest that Coinbase will continue its beta launch until it's ready to take on higher volumes. During this time, Armstrong said that Coinbase will work to ensure it can handle demand and that its risk management services are operating correctly.  As such, Armstrong's comments suggested that he hopes initial users can remain patient with the company until such time as the service can grow, saying:  ""I'd hate to launch something with such low limits and have people say 'Oh it's not even useful yet'. But, you've got to start somewhere and hopefully we can raise it from there.""

42377604,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX72Qut,1410383151,Amagi Metals CEO: Bitcoin Will Replace the US Dollar in My Lifetime,"Amagi Metals took the bitcoin community by surprise this August when it broke ranks with even its more progressive peers in the precious metals space to boldly announce it would stop accepting the US dollar as a payment method by 2017.  Though some in the bitcoin community decried the news as a publicity stunt, CEO Stephen Macaskill asserts that his commitment to digital currency is personal.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Macaskill framed the gradual rollout of this initiative as one that will simply take time given Amagi's need to convince key partners such as mints and dealer networks to accept payment in bitcoin. Further, Macaskill affirmed that bitcoin has had a profound impact on not just his business, but on his perspective about life itself.  The 26-year-old entrepreneur told CoinDesk:  ""A few years ago I was very pessimistic, but bitcoin has definitely changed that for me. Looking at the financial situation of the US, we have an enormous amount of debt. We're closing in on $18tn in debt, the dollar is controlled by a monopoly and they want to make their constituents happy and they printing dollars into infinity, devaluing it.""  Given these realities, Macaskill suggested that a large financial meltdown may soon occur. To Macaskill, the world isn't far away from some type of cataclysm, to be followed by a period of mass protests, riots and extreme poverty. In this light, Macaskill sees bitcoin as a conservative business decision, one that positions his business to not just thrive, but survive.  ""I'd rather be safe than sorry. I'd rather lose a little business sooner than later than end up with a lot of worthless paper which can't even buy me a loaf of bread,"" Macaskill added.  Flash of inspiration  Some more skeptical readers may not be surprised to know that Macaskill came up with the idea to stop accepting US dollars at roughly 3 am.  But for Macaskill, that's when he estimates he made the decision to drop the dollar for good, saying:  ""I just woke up and I thought, 'You know, this is the way we're headed', and I was thinking about when we are going to transition and said I think it's going to be in the next 5–10 years.""  To date, he said he's received a lot of positive feedback for his decision from friends, family and the wider cryptocurrency community. Still, he has since added one caveat to his company's earlier announcement, suggesting the US dollar can still win his business back.  ""If the [government] decides to back the dollar with a cryptocurrency, then we'd be more than happy to continue accepting it after 2016,"" he joked.  Client and customer reaction  Despite the potential challenges posed by operating a business without any fiat revenue, Macaskill is confident that, even if the move sounds unsustainable now, it won't seem that way by 2017. Macaskill told CoinDesk that he's already speaking to vendors and suppliers, laying the groundwork for them to join the bitcoin ecosystem.  Macaskill said his business partners are interested in bitcoin and hold a positive view regarding the moves Amagi Metals has made, even if they're not ready to begin accepting bitcoin now.  ""That's part of the reason why we can't switch to bitcoin immediately, because we have suppliers that only accept USD,"" he said.  Macaskill also acknowledged that not all Amagi customers have been happy about his decision to drop fiat. Still, he sees these individuals representing just a small part of his customer base. His employees are also enthusiastic about the decision, and by 2017 their salaries will be paid in bitcoin, said Macaskill.  He added:  ""I'm pretty sure they all hold bitcoin. I'm not entirely sure, but I know they're all pretty big fans.""  Faith in sound money  Even within the wider precious metals industry, Macaskill framed himself as a bit of an anomaly. Despite the bold moves made by both his company and competitors like Agora Commodities and Provident Metals, he said technological sophistication is in short supply in the gold industry.  ""There are still gold dealers today who don't know how to use an email address,"" he said.  Macaskill, by contrast, has been a lifelong Internet entrepreneur. He began his first business venture, Amagi Clothing, in college, before eventually buying an online precious metals company a fellow student had started.  His belief in bitcoin makes more sense when you consider the boon it has provided to Amagi so far. At one point, Amagi Metals was the largest retail business in the digital currency space, and to date, it's processed more than $10m in bitcoin business. By 2013, when many major merchants had yet to hear about the technology, the company was processing $20,000–$40,000 a day in bitcoin sales.  Further, Macaskill has stuck with bitcoin, even when it hasn't been beneficial. For example, his company lost a former banking partner in 2013 due to its bitcoin support.  Unshakable optimism  Whatever the detractors say, Macaskill believes the future is bright for both his company and the world, even if the US dollar's days are numbered.  Though he still fears the worst about the future of the American currency, he's now confident that the world would be able to recover, even from a large-scale economic catastrophe. The key reason for this, he says, is bitcoin.  ""With bitcoin, we now have a stable currency that's starting to gain adoption around the world and I think that it's going to replace the dollar in my lifetime, if not bitcoin at least another cryptocurrency.""  With this in mind, he added: ""I am extremely optimistic about the future, not just for myself but for the world.""

42426049,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhzdh,1410376526,Financial Planning Association: Bitcoin Can Boost Portfolio Returns,"An industry group representing certified financial planners has found that bitcoin can be a beneficial addition to investor portfolios.  In the new report, the Financial Planning Association (FPA) asserted that for many investors, bitcoin represents a potential opportunity that could both diversify and boost the efficiency of a portfolio.  The FPA study compares the performance of bitcoin markets with other major asset indexes, concluding that though bitcoin does not demonstrate the attributes of a successful currency, the act of trading and investing digital currency can be profitable.  The FPA noted:  “Trading and investing in a virtual currency, such as bitcoins, is readily accessible to individual investors. Uncertainty regarding taxation of bitcoin transactions has been ameliorated with new IRS tax guidance. Given these observations, and the conclusions from the empirical analysis, individual investors can benefit from holding a small amount of bitcoins in a diversified portfolio.”  While the report is largely positive about digital currency, it did deem bitcoin “a very illiquid financial asset”, underscoring its finding that digital currency investments are still highly risky.  Based in Denver, Colorado, the group represents financial planning professionals around the globe. The FPA has chapters in more than 30 countries worldwide and claims nearly 24,000 members.  Risky business  The study compared bitcoin to both fiat currencies like the US dollar, the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc, as well as assets like gold, property and both stocks and bonds. The results suggested that in the context of portfolio management and financial planning, bitcoin may present a welcome – though risky – opportunity.  For example, the FPA report found that bitcoin had a low correlation with the performance of other non-currency asset classes. Additionally, none of the other asset classes appeared to have an impact on the price of bitcoin.  The report stated:  “This indicates that bitcoins could serve as a potent diversifier for an investment portfolio.”  The FPA findings also suggested that bitcoin may enhance the efficiency of a portfolio. The study utilized two mock portfolios, one including bitcoin and one excluding the digital currency.  The report noted:  “Comparing [the data] also demonstrates that portfolio returns are higher, and the risk (probability) of incurring a loss is much lower, when bitcoins are added to an investment portfolio with every portfolio optimization measure examined. Hence, the analysis demonstrates that adding bitcoins to an investor’s portfolio does enhance efficiency.”  Given the risks involved, the FPA clarified its position by saying that it is not explicitly endorsing bitcoin as worthwhile investment. Instead, the group sought to show that digital currency does have a place in investment if handled correctly.  Group urges small investments  Despite the possible benefits, the FPA said that investing in bitcoin should not be taken lightly, and that financial planners should limit their clients' exposure to digital currency holdings.  The FPA wrote:  “It is important [for financial planners] to underscore the risk involved with investing in these assets. Bitcoins should only be held as a minor component of a well-diversified portfolio, such as in a market-weighted basket of major asset classes.”  The report also included information for financial planners who have clients that wish to get involved with bitcoin. Echoing warnings from government organizations like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the FPA said that investors need to be careful about where and how they buy their bitcoin.

42426054,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhznh,1410366373,Satoshi Email Hacker May Have Struck Before,"As the affair of Satoshi Nakamoto's email hijacking drifted further toward farce today, an older story re-emerged as observers noted similarities between current events and an attempt to hijack bitcoin evangelist Roger Ver's online identities in May.  No details of Satoshi Nakamoto's true identity have yet emerged from the latest incident, and the 'ransom' bitcoin address his alleged email hacker posted online seems to have stalled at only 1.55 BTC of its 25 BTC target (see image below).  New identity hunt  With Satoshi's identity apparently safe once more, attention has turned to that of the perpetrator.  The home page of Twitter account '@LulzClerk’, which the alleged hacker had provided in an interview with Vice's Motherboard blog, listed alternate online handles which seemed familiar: 'Savaged' and 'Nitrous' were also used by the person or persons involved in the Roger Ver hacking/blackmailing incident.  It is possible those identities had been hijacked, however, or were put there deliberately to mislead, but as Ver told CoinDesk:  ""There isn't 100% hard proof, but the person is using all the same names and images as my hacker and is even claiming himself to be the same person. His attitude also seems to be very similar.""  Ver also noted that the 37.6 BTC bounty/reward he offered the public to deter the hacker at the time (and which worked effectively, forcing the perpetrator into a hasty retreat) remained unclaimed, as the alleged attacker had still not been positively identified.  Several posts on popular forums like Reddit and Bitcoin Talk had identified and 'doxxed' (ie: revealed multiple personal details online) an individual alleged to be that person several times over the past few months, but Ver said he has not seen any real evidence to support the claim.  The bounty website  Ver and his associates are also in the process of building a formal website with details and conditions of the reward.  To claim the 37.6 BTC, an informant should submit all documentary evidence they possess to block chain certification site Proof of Existence, and to the proper law enforcement agencies.  Should that result in an arrest leading to a conviction, the informant must then contact Ver via the website and use the timestamp provided by Proof of Existence to prove their information was responsible.  Ver said this system allows the informant to remain anonymous if desired, providing only a bitcoin address to receive the reward. If no informant identifies themselves, or if law enforcement apprehends the perpetrator without help, he will donate the 37.6 BTC to charity.  If the website idea proves popular, Ver added, more bounties could be offered to solve several other notorious bitcoin mysteries, including those responsible for hacking Mt Gox and Bitcoinica.  ""I'm sure the public will have lots more ideas,"" Ver concluded.

42426044,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhzVh,1410354972,IBM Sees Role for Block Chain in Internet of Things,"IBM researchers are looking into the possibility of using block chain technology for the Internet of Things (IoT) – a term for the growing network of devices with basic computer-like capabilities that communicate over the web.  The IoT is likely to bring a major change in the way we use technology, with interaction between connected everyday devices (such as pacemakers, fire alarms or air-conditioning units) and humans increasingly becoming the norm.  Now IBM is examining the use of block chain technology for an IoT distribution platform, backed by other peer-to-peer (P2P) technologies.  The system, dubbed 'Adept', will rely on three different technologies to resolve a number of issues related to IoT development and commercialisation.  Three key protocols  Although it was conceived in IBM’s labs, Adept is not an official 'Big Blue' product. Instead, it is open-source software to be released on GitHub.  Adept will employ block chain technology in its distributed transaction processing engine that will allow IoT devices to communicate and interact with one another.  Paul Brody, head of mobile and Internet of Things at IBM, told Gigaom that block chain technology can allow IoT devices to ‘understand’ what other devices around them are up to and it can support different kinds of instructions and permissions.  The block chain could allow devices to track other devices and their relationship to them, while maintaining security and offloading the power-hungry authentication process to the block chain network. The devices could store their ‘relationships’ with other devices via the block chain, allowing them to authenticate other devices and users.  IBM plans to use another P2P technology to ensure connectivity. BitTorrent – a protocol commonly used for file sharing – could be used to move packets of data on slow networks. Since many IoT devices will not have a wasteful high-speed modem and always-on connectivity, a P2P system like BitTorrent would provide a more robust network, the team says.  The third technology to be employed in Adept is Telehash, a private messaging protocol with end-to-end encryption. Other services can be built on top of it, allowing secure communication between various IoT devices.  Multiple advantages  Brody said there are two main reasons behind his team’s decision to use P2P technologies. Cost is the primary factor, as managing all IoT devices in a centralised cloud would simply be too expensive in the long run. IoT devices are envisioned as low-cost, low-maintenance devices that should run for years if not decades.  The sheer number of devices represents a big challenge too. Speaking at the Intel Developer Forum 2014 on Tuesday, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said the company expects as many as 50 billion connected devices will be deployed by the end of the decade.  Market research firm Gartner has given the more conservative estimate that 26 billion IoT devices will be installed by 2020, but said even this number will generate incremental value exceeding $300bn. With such figures in mind, it is clear that Brody’s decentralised peer-to-peer system could tap into a huge emerging market.  Another factor is the business model itself. IBM's Brody said the block chain could lead to new business models for all companies involved in the space, allowing IoT devices to share data, processing power, bandwidth and even electricity.  Brody outlined his vision for a decentralised Internet of Things in a Gigaom podcast earlier this week. In essence, the block chain approach proposed by Brady would not have to rely on scarcity like bitcoin, which means it could operate without industrial-scale mining which is slowly taking over the bitcoin network.

42426060,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhzvh,1410346023,BitFlyer Launches Japan's First Bitcoin Crowdfunding Platform,"Japanese bitcoin market bitFlyer has added a bitcoin crowdfunding platform called 'fundFlyer' to its feature list, launching the first service of its type in the country.  The system works in a fashion similar to more established crowdfunding services like Kickstarter and Japan's own Shooting Star, but is taking a significant step towards mainstreaming bitcoin use in its home country with at least one high-profile user.  The fundFlyer website lists ""the arts, product and software development, events, disaster prevention and political activity"" as projects with bitcoin crowdfunding potential, and encourages project owners to use the platform to build long-lasting communities.  Like other services, it allows project owners to set funding goals and differing levels of gifts, or perks, for supporters. Normally fundFlyer itself receives 10% of the total amount raised, but is currently offering 0% usage fees as an introductory campaign.  Payouts are only made if projects reach their targets, and owners may claim the funds either as bitcoins or cash, through bitFlyer's exchange. In the case of an unsuccessful campaign, bitcoins will be paid back to supporters.  Politician on board  The service's first listed project belongs to none other than Mineyuki Fukuda, head of the Japanese government's IT Strategy Committee and its leading bitcoin proponent.  Fukuda also has an active fiat currency-based crowdfunding project to take a study tour of bitcoin interests in San Francisco and Washington DC, but hopes to use the bitcoin-based fundFlyer campaign to supplement tour costs.  His fundFlyer project has raised 1.443 BTC of its 4 BTC goal, and will finish on 15th September. Supporter gifts are similar on both campaigns, ranging from a published copy of his report, to seminars and even a tour of the Japanese parliament.  Fukuda said his motive in starting the campaigns was also to demonstrate personally the advantages that come with using bitcoin and digital currencies to others in business and politics.  Japan's first 'post-Gox' exchange  Launched in April 2014, BitFlyer was the first serious bitcoin market in Japan after Mt Gox collapsed in February. In the intervening period, residents of the world's third-largest economy had to use overseas markets or face-to-face trades if they wanted to acquire bitcoin.  Others have since entered the local space, including Pay-bit.net, which takes credit cards, and Quoine, aimed at professional traders. BitFlyer is aiming to dominate the newcomer/consumer segment.  In July, it announced it had raised $1.6m in funding and is currently looking for further investment from overseas to fund its international expansion.  Compliance and tax  CEO Yuzo Kano, a former trader at Goldman Sachs, and CTO Takafumi Komiyama head a current staff of 14, plus investors.  BitFlyer is a simple set-price market similar to Coinbase, rather than a full open order book trading exchange. This means it actually buys the bitcoins itself and sells those it has in its account, rather than allowing trading between users.  The exchange is fully compliant with know-your-customer (KYC) regulations for Japanese financial institutions, and its prices also include Japanese consumption tax (which was recently hiked from 5% to 8%).  The Japanese tax authorities are expected to require bitcoin users and businesses to pay their own consumption tax on bitcoin purchases if they acquired the bitcoin from a non-Japanese exchange, or one that did not include tax in its price.

42426051,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhzfh,1410338690,MergerTech Accepts Bitcoin For Startup Sales Services,"MergerTech has announced that it will now accept bitcoin as payment for its merger and acquisition (M&A) advisory services.  The California-based company has a history of working to help tech companies with less than $100m in revenue achieve successful exits. For example, MergerTech brokered mobile banking startup Simple's $117m sale to megabank BBVA earlier this year.  Speaking to CoinDesk, MergerTech founder and CEO Nitin Khanna framed the company's decision to accept bitcoin as a way his team could learn more about the bitcoin ecosystem while gaining new clients seeking M&A deals.  Khanna told CoinDesk that he believes the time is now for MergerTech to move aggressively to court bitcoin businesses, saying:  ""Companies that are innovating in bitcoin today will start getting bought by the Googles, the Microsofts and the Oracles. That's where we come in. We really understand the system where small companies get bought by larger companies, so we want to be ready in six, nine or 12 months to represent them.""  Khanna went on to say that he believes the M&A market for bitcoin companies will grow to rival the now bustling mobile payments and cloud computing spaces.  ""We don't feel bitcoin is any different,"" he added. ""It's a massive innovation, it's getting funded, and for some of the companies, their exit will be through M&A.""  Service overview  MergerTech indicated that it will accept bitcoin privately, not through any merchant processor. Rather, when a MergerTech client wants to make a payment in bitcoin, it will set up an account with the customer's desired bitcoin service to receive the funds.  The firm will accept bitcoin for both the commitment fees it receives at the start of the project, and the success fees it earns when the project ends. Commitment fees, Khanna said, generally cost between $25,000 and $50,000, while success fees range from an average of $1m to as much as $5m.  Khanna said:  ""We'll be opening it up where clients can pay either of those two fees in bitcoin.""  As part of the service, MergerTech will help its clients understand the potential sales opportunities they may be able to pursue and how much they might generate in a sale.  Enterprise innovation  While receiving payments in bitcoin is a short-term goal for MergerTech, Khanna explained that, as an entrepreneur, he is also interested in using bitcoin for enterprise payments.  Khanna, who owns bitcoins personally, suggested that the bitcoin community would be wise to build solutions for larger businesses like his own, companies that must process thousands of dollars in payment every time a transaction occurs.  He suggested that there is no enterprise solution that can help a company like MergerTech convert the bitcoin it receives, while paying employees, banking partners and vendors with a share of the fee. As such, he hopes MergerTech can help make entrepreneurs aware of this pain point.  ""If we don't start accepting bitcoin for larger payments, I don't think innovation in the enterprise space keeps up with the end consumer, small consumer payments,"" Khanna said.  Block chain and beyond  Khanna is also interested in advanced block chain applications given his past experiences as the chairman and CEO of Saber Corp, a software company that assisted governments with election management, motor vehicle management and voter registration, among other tasks.  Founded in 1997, the company was purchased by Electronic Data Systems Corp for $420m in an all-cash sale. Khanna co-founded the company with his brother and COO Karan Khanna.  His comments suggested that Khanna may be considering the potential uses of the block chain for his own initiatives, however, he stopped short of such a declaration.  Khanna said:  ""We're super excited about, not just the payments industry, but what the block chain can do for things like elections. Bitcoin starts as a currency but will spread across all kinds of startups.""
