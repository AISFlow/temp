42386333,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBSXIZ,1617224418,Enterprise Blockchain Doesn't Work Because It's About the Real World,"Blockchain has come a long way since its 2008 debut as the ingenious technology underlying Bitcoin. Today companies and governments the world over are exploring new applications in which blockchains track, not the flow of digital currency, but things and events in the real world. But this tether to reality is enterprise blockchain’s Achilles heel.      To see why, let’s go back to where it all began. When bitcoin first appeared, a common reaction was: Why would anyone exchange their hard-earned dollars for that? The answer, it’s become clear, is that bitcoin is valuable, and that is a good reason to own some – or, better put, to hold some. How much bitcoin you and everyone else holds is recorded in the Bitcoin blockchain.    Martin Glazier is a philosopher at the University of Hamburg, where he focuses on metaphysics, science, logic and language.    But this is a funny kind of “record.” Most records memorialize real facts, facts that are independent of the records themselves. Take your birth certificate. It records a real event, your birth, which exists apart from the certificate. This is why it is possible for your birth certificate to be inaccurate. It could simply get the facts wrong about when and where you were born.      Bitcoin is different. The blockchain records everyone’s bitcoin holdings, but those holdings are not independent of the blockchain. Quite the opposite: How much BTC you hold depends entirely on what the blockchain says. (Philosophers call this kind of dependence “metaphysical ground.”)      So calling the blockchain a record of people’s bitcoin holdings is misleading. There are no real facts, existing independently of the blockchain, about how much bitcoin everyone holds. Instead, it’s better to say the blockchain just dictates how much bitcoin everyone holds. What it says, goes.      This means the blockchain has a remarkable property: It is guaranteed to be an accurate guide to people’s bitcoin holdings. Because the blockchain dictates how much bitcoin you hold, it can’t fail to be right in what it says about that.      See also: Brady Dale - Don’t Follow the Suits, Follow the Weirdos      I’ve mostly been talking so far about blockchain’s application to cryptocurrency. It’s in those applications that the blockchain is guaranteed to be accurate (bracketing so-called double-spends or other rare events). But there are many other applications that lack any such guarantee.      Take a case that has already come up: birth certificates. Births are real events in the world. We can design a blockchain to record those events, but the events themselves are independent of the blockchain. Unlike your bitcoin holdings, no blockchain can dictate when and where you were born. And that means it is possible for the blockchain to be inaccurate. Nothing prevents the blockchain from just being wrong about your birth.      Of course, just as it is very hard for anyone to tamper with the transaction statements that make up the Bitcoin blockchain, it will be very hard for anyone to alter your birth records once they have been added to the birth certificate blockchain. But that does nothing to ensure those records were accurate in the first place.      The same goes for many other enterprise applications of blockchain. Consider supply chain management. We can design a blockchain to track diamonds from mines to jewelers, but that does not mean the diamonds are where the blockchain says they are.      Or consider health care. We can record on a blockchain that you have been vaccinated against COVID-19, but that doesn’t mean the shot has really gone into your arm.      So we have two big groups of applications of blockchain technology: the ones in which the blockchain is nearly guaranteed to be accurate, like Bitcoin; and the ones in which it is not, like birth certificates. Call the applications in the first group accurate and those in the second group non-accurate.      I don’t want to say that we should only ever pursue accurate applications of blockchain. Some non-accurate applications can still deliver accuracy, if they’re supplemented by something else. For example, if we have some way to ensure that birth certificates are accurate when they’re added to the blockchain, we can be sure they will remain so – even though the blockchain on its own doesn’t guarantee their accuracy. And maybe there are non-accurate applications where accuracy is unimportant or where the concept of accuracy just doesn’t apply.      But the distinctive potential of blockchain technology lies in accurate applications – applications where the blockchain contains data, not about some independently existing reality like births but about a reality the blockchain itself dictates, such as bitcoin holdings. In these cases, the blockchain (almost) can’t be wrong.      See also: Paul Brody - Public Blockchains Are Set to Reshape Global Commerce      For a long time, the only accurate applications were to cryptocurrency. But that is changing. The current non-fungible token (NFT) boom is a prime example. The fact that MetaKovan paid over $69 million for a NFT of Beeple’s digital artwork “Everydays” is not independent of the blockchain. Quite the contrary. His holding that NFT depends entirely on the blockchain saying he does. The blockchain dictates who holds which NFTs.      What other accurate applications are there? We might try to extend the example of NFTs to the ownership of intellectual property like copyrights and trademarks, or even real property like land and houses. Of course, a house exists independently of any blockchain, but not necessarily from the fact that you own the house.      A reworking of the foundations of property law seems unlikely anytime soon. But perhaps a more viable, accurate application is to voting. A jurisdiction (say, West Virginia) could recognize a blockchain, as opposed to a paper ballot, as the final word on what votes were cast. It could be guaranteed to give an accurate vote count.      The price of accuracy is unreality. The Bitcoin blockchain is accurate only because what it “records” isn’t real: Bitcoin holdings are shadows cast by the blockchain itself. Enterprise blockchains reach beyond these shadows into the real world, but in doing so they abandon the surety that is the technology’s distinctive promise.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY,Martin Glazier,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/03/31/enterprise-blockchain-doesnt-work-because-its-about-the-real-world,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0c8ea270a7432f7ef36dc19f4222d00f809c54fe-1400x1067.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The largest cryptocurrency's price over the past week has been pushing back up toward $60,000, and a breach of that crucial psychological level could trigger to a rally to a new all-time high, analysts said.

In legal filings shared with CoinDesk , Judge Louise Botham found that “the complainant’s misrepresentation was not a bare assertion but a convincing, extended ruse, documented on video.” The filings also noted that other evidence included text messages discussing the setup in advance of the events.

42386338,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBSXQ7,1617220568,Scams and Fraud Bubble Up as NFT Mania Takes Hold,"After a non-fungible token (NFT) selling a cybersecurity exploit and a NFT marketplace getting hacked, another common specter of the cryptocurrency world has taken root in the NFT ecosystem – scams.      According to new research out today from Bolster, a deep learning-powered fraud prevention platform, five areas of scams or frauds are booming along with the NFT bubble. These include replica NFT stores, fake NFT stores, counterfeit or fraud NFTs, fake airdrops and NFT giveaways, and social media scams.      “Cryptocurrencies and NFTs have attracted the attention of cyber criminals,“ said Bolster CTO and co-founder Shashi Prakash in an email. “Anybody who is participating in these markets must be super vigilant because there are very few protections for people who get scammed.”    The NFT scams that mimic the real thing    The new research from Bolster highlights the explosion in volume and reach of scams alongside NFTs’ rapid rise to prominence.      For example, replica stores, a well-honed tactic in the world of online fraud, are regularly spun up to look exactly like legitimate websites. Scammers generally try to grab users' login credentials or credit card details. In March, Bolster found the “number of suspicious-looking domain registrations with names of NFT stores like 'rarible', 'opensea', and 'audius' have increased nearly 300%” when compared to previous months, according to a blog post accompanying the research.    Read more: Lessons From the Nifty Gateway NFT Heist: Not Your Keys, Not Your Art    Fake NFT stores are akin to replica ones but don’t rely on proven brand names; rather, they take advantage of the frothy nature of the NFT market generally. Instead of replicating NFT marketplace OpenSea, for example, these fake stores use non-affiliated logos and content to sell non-existent NFTs.      Before a fake or replica site can be created, a domain has to be registered for it. Bolster identified a rapid rise in suspicious domain registrations using words such as “crypto,” “nft,” “market'' and “trade” from February to March of this year. Domains registered using combinations of these terms increased from 250% to over 300% leading up to March 13.      Bolster also suggested that given the high-level sale of a Banksy-styled NFT that was unaffiliated with Banksy, counterfeit or fraudulent NFTs should continue to spread, noting increases in suspicious domains such as banksynft[.]com and banksynfts[.]com.    No one is giving you free tokens or NFTs    Another prominent, and perhaps the most damaging, scam tactic involves airdrops, a common marketing strategy used by crypto projects. An airdrop is basically when a project gives away its tokens or coins for free to increase the user base and incentivize people to participate.      But they are also ripe for imitation.      “The most damaging scam was the fake giveaways of Rarible tokens,” said Prakash.      In this giveaway scam involving the NFT marketplace Rarible, visitors to a fake domain were encouraged to send their RARI tokens to a wallet address with the promise they would be sent exponentially more in return as part of a giveaway to encourage cryptocurrency adoption.      “There is no free money, but people just cannot seem to resist the opportunity to get something for nothing, said Prakash. “This continues to be one of the most common scams for NFTs and cryptocurrencies.”      According to Bolster, the company detects “thousands of these every month.”    Read more: We Went Hunting for Crypto Scams in Google and Apple App Stores. Here’s What We Found    Social media scams were the final trend Bolster identified for NFTs. On social media platforms like Telegram and Discord communities for projects congregate and communicate, often sharing information, vetting ideas and communicating updates.      “On both these channels, scammers set up groups targeting almost all the brands in the crypto space,” read the blog post accompanying the research. “Most of these groups claim to be the 'official support’ or 'official community’ of the targeted brand.”      Prakash said users should be cautious when being sent links to groups such as these, and even a simple search on Google or Twitter can help people suss out what is legit and what isn’t.    Protecting yourself    Beyond the basic Google search, there are additional steps people can take to make sure they don't become victims of scammers.      Prakash recommended doing a reverse image search on an NFT to make sure it is not showing up on other NFT exchanges/markets. He also said to make sure the site from which you’re purchasing is legitimate: Don’t click on links sent by email or social media to get to the site. Finally, use two-factor authentication or physical token generators, or device-based authenticator apps to protect your username and password.    Read more: A Hacker Was Selling a Cybersecurity Exploit as an NFT. Then OpenSea Stepped In    In the seemingly first NFT heist of its time, users’ accounts on NFT marketplace Nifty Gateway were taken over by a hacker and their NFTs were stolen. None of the accounts compromised had two-factor authentication enabled.      “People interested in NFTs need to do their diligence and research the apps and services they plan to use,” said Prakash. “Nobody else is doing that for consumers, so the burden really falls on the individual to protect themselves.”",NEGATIVE,없음,MARKET | RESEARCH | AIRDROP,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/03/31/scams-and-fraud-bubble-up-as-nft-mania-takes-hold,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b50eb6e5e18f4019bc85ac045d2eaaba13299a30-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386345,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBSXSd,1617217211,"Why Genesis, BlockFi, Ledn Are Cutting Interest Rates on Large-Scale Bitcoin Deposits","Crypto lending firms including Genesis and BlockFi are cutting the interest rates they pay on large-scale bitcoin deposits, potentially signaling an end to the glorified 4% to 6% levels that have served as a staple of the lucrative market.      Behind the cuts in the crypto interest rates, according to industry executives, is shrinking demand from big traders to borrow bitcoin (BTC) for easy profit opportunities. There is simply too much bitcoin supply in search of yield, relative to institutional demand. So the bitcoin lenders are protecting their margins by cutting deposit rates.      Starting Thursday, Genesis Global Trading, a full-service digital-currency prime broker, plans to refinance bitcoin deposit rates for institutional lenders and deposit-platform partners to a range of 2% to 3.5%, Matthew Ballensweig, lending director at Genesis, told CoinDesk in an email. Genesis is owned by Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.      ""We're currently showing rates closer to 3.5% to 5.5%,"" Ballensweig wrote. ""Inflated rates are not truthful of the underlying market.”      Last week, BlockFi, a cryptocurrency firm, lowered rates to an annual percentage yield (APY) of 2%, from 3%, for accounts holding one to 20 BTC. The firm also introduced a new tier for accounts holding 20 BTC and above, paying just 0.5%.      ""Rates at BlockFi reflect market conditions, which evolve based on a variety of factors, "" Zac Prince, CEO of BlockFi, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.      And Ledn, a Canadian cryptocurrency lender, announced March 26 that it will cut interest rates effective April 1 on balances greater than 2 BTC.      ""The market can no longer support paying 6% savings rate for all of our clients,"" Ledn said in a tweet.      According to analysts and industry executives, a key factor leading to lower institutional borrowing of bitcoin is the flip of what is known as the ""Grayscale premium"" to a discount.      That refers to the difference between bitcoin's price in spot cryptocurrency markets and the price for BTC as implied by the net asset value (NAV) of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). (Grayscale is another CoinDesk sister company.)      When the Grayscale trust traded at a premium to NAV, hedge funds and other investors could borrow bitcoin and deliver those to the trust in exchange for GBTC shares. After a six-month lockup, the shares could then be sold on the secondary market to retail investors, typically at a premium. Proceeds were then used to pay back the lender for the borrowed BTC at a profit.      But based on the current GBTC discount, there's no longer an incentive on the part of large traders to borrow BTC for the opportunity.      Given the industry dislocation, some crypto lenders see an opportunity to pick up market share.      ""We actually saw record net deposits ($90 million a day) and record loans since BlockFi lowered rates,"" Alex Mashinsky, CEO of Celsius Network, a cryptocurrency lending platform, told CoinDesk in an email. ""We actually raised a few rates we pay in the past week and plan to raise further if our income continues to rise.""",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Damanick Dantes,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/03/31/why-genesis-blockfi-ledn-are-cutting-interest-rates-on-large-scale-bitcoin-deposits,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7ae3e09c551e75c59af5274c78a9268c2dd6f061-1200x588.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Seeking to gamify fixed interest rates, CEO Will Villanueva told CoinDesk the Element Protocol will imminently launch with a novel two token-system for enhancing liquidity.      The upcoming protocol is poised to enter an already bustling crypto lending and borrowing scene where established firms woo new deposits with the promise of lucrative rates. But those traditional interest rate schemes freeze up the underlying capital, a hallmark feature of lending one’s money that Villanueva sees more as a bug.      Element works by splitting those deposits into two tokens – one representing the principal position and the other a stand-in for the interest rate. Users could then opt to sell the rights to their principal token while still hanging onto the interest-bearing one.      “Because we split it into two positions you can sell your position at a discount so you can get more exposure to your interest,” he explained.

In an announcement, the restaurant said it has teamed up with former Ripple Labs CTO Stefan Thomas to launch a new interactive game called ""Burritos or Bitcoin.""      The game has been inspired by Thomas, who famously lost the password to his hard drive that now has $387 million worth of bitcoin stored on it.      Players will carry out a mock ""chiptocurrency"" rescue mission and crack the code of a digital wallet. The contestants will guess a valid six-digit code 10 times for a chance to win a free burrito or bitcoin on this website: burritosorbitcoin.com.      Chipotle said 10,000 players will win a free burrito, 50 players will win $500 in bitcoin and three players will win $25,000 in bitcoin.

42386335,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBSXNb,1617210656,Over 50% of Binance's Russian Customers Believe Crypto Can Replace Bank Deposits,"Binance users in Russia believe crypto can one day elbow out banks.      The cryptocurrency exchange, which is one of the most popular ones in Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) area, surveyed users about their preferences in crypto. The survey results, reviewed by CoinDesk, offer a granular portrait of an average crypto user in this region, which leads the world in cryptocurrency adoption.      According to the report, out of 23,133 Binance users who took part in the poll, only 79.9% actually own crypto at this point of time.      A slim majority of users – 58.2% – believe that at some point in the future crypto can replace bank deposits as a way to save money, and 77.5% believe cryptocurrencies are good for the economy. About 40% are not using other tools such as stocks, mutual funds or investment in real estate.      A significant number of those who took the survey, 71.5%, said it's important for them to have opportunities to pay for goods and services with crypto. However, only 25.7% had an actual experience doing that.      Only 3.5% of respondents are hardcore bitcoiners keeping their crypto portfolios all in bitcoin, while 37.7% hold altcoins only and 34.5% only hold a minor, 1% to 20% portion of their crypto bags in BTC, the survey says.      Some 61% said their crypto holdings gained some profit in 2020; 72% said they are going to keep buying more through 2021. More than a half said they are mining proof-of-work cryptocurrencies or staking proof-of-stake coins.      People listed several reasons for buying crypto: while 37.7% were attracted by the price appreciation in 2020, 25.3% don't trust the traditional financial system and use crypto as a hedge. A smaller percentage noted the less-than-attractive interest rates of bank deposits and the inflation of the national currency (18.5% and 9.3%, respectively).

Only a third of respondents know about the decentralized finance (DeFi) industry and only 15% own coins involved in the DeFi economy.      The vast majority – 83% – of those who took the survey live in Russia, 12.8% in Ukraine, 1% in Kazakhstan and even fewer in other countries. Most of the respondents are male (92.8%); only 7.3% are women, 58% haven't reached the age of 35 and 20% are younger than 25.      More than a half have a college education, work as payroll employees and consider their income as ""average."" Most are buying crypto using their salaries (59.3%) or savings (27.4%).

42386332,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBSXML,1617210053,Strike Launches Bitcoin Lightning Payment App in El Salvador; Full EU Support Is Next,"Bitcoin’s Lightning Network-powered Venmo, Strike, is now available in El Salvador, and its team is planning on a full rollout in Europe soon along with a feature which allows users to convert their paychecks into bitcoin.      The payment app goes live in the country today, according to a press release. This comes some months after Strike, the brainchild of Lightning developer Jack Mallers, opened up a beta to European Union, U.K. and Philippines residents. Strike released its beta in the U.S. eight months ago.    Read more: Bitcoin Lightning Startup Zap Goes Global, Adding Multiple Fiat Pairs, Stablecoins    “Our decision to enter El Salvador as our first non-U.S. market was intentional. One of the opportunities that interest us the most at Strike is our ability to deliver financial tools to emerging markets. El Salvador is the sixth-highest ranked country in inbound remittance from the United States,” Mallers told CoinDesk.      “They don't have supportive financial regulations, they don't have supportive fintech banking infrastructure, they don't have peer-to-peer applications and so on. Through initiatives like the Bitcoin Beach project, they've looked to bitcoin as an asset and network to improve financial access,” he continued.    Bitcoin Beach: Bitcoin’s tropical circular economy    Bitcoin Beach is a social experiment in El Salvador, funded by an anonymous bitcoin whale, where the local populace has adopted bitcoin as a means of account and payment.      Strike’s latest rollout follows Maller’s jaunt in El Zonte and Punta Manga, the two Salvadoran towns whose local economy has used bitcoin via the Lightning Network since 2020 as a payment method. Strike will now play an integral role in easing the remittance process for these communities and their families abroad.    Read more: What Is the Lightning Network?    “We are very excited about how Strike will revolutionize the remittances industry. About 22% of El Salvador’s GDP comes from remittances. Sending money from the U.S. to relatives in El Salvador using legacy companies like Western Union is very inefficient and expensive. Currently, the process involves someone in the U.S. driving to a Western Union office and paying upwards of 20% in fees to send money to El Salvador,” said Michael Peterson of Bitcoin Beach, the project that bootstrapped the bitcoin circular economy in these villages.      Peterson said Salvadorans can now use Strike to receive remittances from their families abroad without the added hassle of currency conversion. The relatives top up their Strike with dollars (or euros or pound sterling) and send an equivalent value in bitcoin over the Lightning Network to their families in El Salvador.      “Most people in El Salvador do not have bank accounts, and at this point the Strike App cannot connect to banks [in the country],” Peterson said, highlighting the app’s usefulness for remittances.      “For most people their Bitcoin Lightning Wallet is their bank and their smartphone is more useful than a bank account. In the time it used to take them just to catch the bus, they can now receive their remittance funds while sitting at home and send it as a Lighting payment to the local store to pay to have milk delivered,” Peterson said.    What is Strike?    Strike uses Bitcoin’s Lightning Network – a software stack and network built on top of Bitcoin core protocol that offers near-instant, low-fee transactions – to settle transactions for its users.      All of the tricky cryptography is done in the background for the user; in fact, all balances on the app show up as fiat currency, and deposits and withdrawals can be made for zero fees by linking a bank account.    Read more: Panthers’ Russell Okung Becomes First NFL Player to Be Paid in Bitcoin    If a user wants to pay someone (or move their funds to their own wallet), then they can withdraw this cash balance in the form of bitcoin either through Lightning or Bitcoin’s primary network.      Mallers told CoinDesk the app has active beta testers in the “Philippines, Canada, the EU, the U.K., Argentina and more."" He said the payment app’s next frontier for fully functioning services is the EU, adding that there are more than 50,000 users on the European waitlist.      Down the pipe for this year, Strike plans to issue its own Visa card and a “Pay me in bitcoin"" feature, the same the neo bank uses to pay out National Football League offensive tackle Russell Okung’s salary. Mallers told CoinDesk this feature would be live very soon for all U.S. Strike users.      “We’re working with some huge names in sports, Hollywood and music,"" he said.

42386325,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBSXB1,1617208554,"Forget GIFs, NFTs Are Essential Infrastructure","William Gibson famously remarked that the future is already here, it’s just not evenly distributed. So we are seeing with the immense popularity of non-fungible tokens (NFTs).      For decades, science fiction writers have tried to imagine what a post-scarcity society might be like, but I suspect none of them predicted that, in the absence of urgent material needs, we might go about re-inventing scarcity for its own sake.    Paul Brody is EY's Global Blockchain leader.    Much of the focus on NFTs has been about their role as ownership tokens for unique pieces of digital art. From tweets to GIFs to video highlights, people may soon discover there is an infinite supply of limited editions and only a few of these may stand the test of time. This kind of discovery process is a normal part of growing markets and it will be as true in the digital world for art as it has been in the physical world.      But the post-scarcity world is not evenly distributed and it can be jarring to watch this play out in the middle of a pandemic with so many people unemployed and hungry.      My own belief is that one of humanity’s greatest achievements has been the ability to eliminate the scarcity of knowledge and art. Nothing sums up how far we have come than the thought that nearly anyone anywhere on Earth has more information, knowledge and art accessible through the little device in their pocket than the richest people 50 years ago.    It can be jarring to watch this play out in the middle of a pandemic with so many people unemployed and hungry.    Whatever happens with the market for collectibles, however, NFTs are essential economic infrastructure with a bright future. Even while digital content and software drive ever-larger parts of our economy into a post-scarcity era, real world constraints will always be with us. There is a finite supply of land and, at any given time, finite supplies of many other critical resources. NFTs have a role to play in putting the finite resources and assets to work.      NFTs are powerful because they allow us to represent both commonality and uniqueness in a single asset class. Smart contracts that define and manage NFTs allow you to define the asset class in general, from a GIF to a work of art to a car, while the individual tokens can represent a specific, unique item in that group.      In the world of supply chains, as things become more valuable they often transition from being representable as fungible tokens (that is, undifferentiated) to unique assets. The washers and screws in my car have no distinct value, but by the time my vehicle rolls off the production line it is a unique item, with my color choices and accessories. Once I’ve driven it a while its value is also determined by how well I care for the car and how much the back seat is covered in dog hair.      See also: Paul Brody - This Isn’t the Revolution I Signed Up For      At EY, we have long assumed NFTs are going to be the critical mechanism for managing the digital representation of high-value assets. We also see them as the key mechanism for representing the inputs and outputs of business processes. Purchase orders are, as a class, pretty typical, but each one is for unique products and amounts. Turning POs or invoices into NFTs means they become transactionable online, opening up credit markets and accelerating digital payments.      Once you take a finite resource and digitize it, you make it possible to manage, transfer and use that resource to an exceptional degree. One of the most galling things about the way our less-than-fully digital economy works is how many people lack access to resources even when those resources are available and nearby.      From MRI machines to construction equipment, many products and services are underutilized because their capacity isn’t visible to users or owners do not have an easy way to monetize that capacity. In both those cases, digitizing those assets, representing them as NFTs and making them visible and accessible can change that situation.      Scarcity will always be with us, and NFTs provide one of the best tools ever invented for making the most of what we have.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Paul Brody,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/03/31/forget-gifs-nfts-are-essential-infrastructure,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d8797913d7c94b8831766650b17aa15f04b644db-1400x788.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Announced Wednesday, Aave will be exploring scalable sidechains with Polygon (formerly known as Matic) to escape the high transaction fees that currently exist on Ethereum. Aave says it will use a soon-to-be available smart-contract bridge that will seamlessly port assets from one network to the other.      The ""DeFi Summer"" of 2020 has not really slowed down, with close to $43 billion currently locked within DeFi lending platforms. Built on Ethereum, Aave, a DeFi protocol aimed at both retail and institutional clients, has a market size of $5.41 billion, making it the third largest in the sector, according to DeFi Pulse.      ""High transaction fees are a feature of a successful public blockchain, as they define actors ready to pay the market price to use and secure decentralized services,” Aave founder Stani Kulechov told CoinDesk via email, adding:      “That being said, DeFi was always intended to create a sustainable and more inclusive alternative to traditional finance. If DeFi is great but only limited to portfolios of five figures and up, DeFi will be falling short of its mission to be finance for everyone.”    Polygon’s latest get    The Polygon network is powered by DeFi’s omnipresent data oracle service Chainlink, allowing the Aave protocol to maintain the highest standard of safety for the protocol price feeds, Kulechov pointed out.      At launch, the Aave Market on Polygon will onboard Polygon’s native MATIC token as collateral, as well as USDC, USDT, DAI, WETH, AAVE and WBTC.

A sidechain on Ethereum refers to any mechanism that allows tokens from the layer 1 mainchain to be securely used within a completely separate blockchain but still moved back to the original chain if necessary.      “One of the main benefits of DeFi is the ability to build synergies with other projects,” Kulechov said. “By providing wide access to Aave, there’s no need for a ‘winner-takes-all’ scalability solution and users can choose the solution they feel comfortable with.”",POSITIVE,AAVE | ETH | MATIC,AAVE | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | MATIC,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/03/31/defi-major-aave-working-with-polygon-to-bypass-ethereum-congestion,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a3e986af03dd8e31e8182f2ed9c2554460f4330d-1409x793.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42386322,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBSXCH,1617205619,Crypto Hype Cycles and You,"Yesterday, Messari founder and CEO Ryan Selkis tweeted that he’s looking to take on 1,000 new analysts and researchers at his boutique, cryptocurrency intelligence firm. It’s the type of goal that has come to define this moment in crypto: equal parts ambition and insanity.      I asked Selkis what he’d do with 1,000 analysts, how he’d coordinate such a team, what resources he’s willing to invest in their training and whether my father should be a fit applicant. He referred me to a blog post he had also tweeted out.    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    It begins by quoting from an old newspaper advert:    ""’Men Wanted: For hazardous journey. Small wages, bitter cold, long months of complete darkness, constant danger, safe return doubtful. Honour and recognition in case of success.’ - Ernest Shackleton, Antarctic explorer.”    The ideal candidate knows there isn’t much glory in writing longform posts about a maligned, though increasing relevant, industry and is probably willing to go unpaid. Stick it out for long enough, however, and you could build a portfolio, reputation and land a job.      Shortly after, Selkis tweeted, “How are so many people still so bad at resumes in 2021?” It may be fair to say his call to action is off to a rocky start, though I have no doubt Selkis will find success along the way.      A previous Messari cohort accepted 70 out of 200 applicants, Selkis wrote, and brought some of the industry’s sharpest minds (Ryan Watkins, Jack Purdy and Mason Nystrom) into the fold.      As others have pointed out, crypto’s greatest strength is its intellectual capital. Hedge fund giant and recent coiner Paul Tudor Jones II praised the ""enormous contention of really, really smart and sophisticated people who believe"" in bitcoin.      While Nic Carter has noted that even if a disastrous event befalls BTC – like a glitch in the code, a wave of state bans, a precipitous drop to zero – there will likely be enough developers and writers willing to stick around and rebuild.      Bitcoin has similar network effects as other communications and digital systems. While there is clearly cyclical boom and busts – where capital and people rush in, only to leave once the tide turns – bitcoin’s price level has steadily progressed over the years.      Following every major crash, bitcoin finds a higher level of support. After surging to almost $1,000 in 2014, BTC never fell below $200. After nearly reaching $20,000 in 2017, BTC found new footing above $3,000. Today, it’s an open question where bitcoin might stabilize after this hype cycle pops.      I’d argue that a similar phenomenon, harder to measure, governs crypto’s social capital.    “Crypto has exited every cycle stronger than it entered. This is true across all key metrics: entrepreneurial and developer activity, academic research, infrastructural maturity, corporate adoption, public awareness, and simplistic price, among others,” Paradigm’s Fred Ehrsam recently wrotehttps://www.paradigm.xyz/How_To_Survive_A_Crypto_Cycle.pdf.    According to Gartner, the research and advisory firm, “hype cycles” progress from a technology trigger (when a technology – like non-fungible tokens – lands), to peaks of “inflated expectations,” through a “trough of disillusionment,” up the “slope of enlightenment” and finally arrive at a “plateau of productivity.”      Messari’s 1,000-strong call to action is banking on people’s inflated expectations around the industry. College seniors, disaffected bankers (hi, Dad) and those looking for a change are probably having a hard time ignoring BTC’s surging price and the genuine fun happening in the NFT space.      When the bubble pops, we’ll still be here.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | RESEARCH,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/03/31/crypto-hype-cycles-and-you,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ab20bf3a840eae37c893b4b956ca6d3b7b4e366d-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386342,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBSXV9,1617203233,Bitcoin Has Best Start to Year Since 2013 as Gold Disappoints,"The debate whether bitcoin is stealing gold's market share as a store-of-value asset could heat up as the biggest cryptocurrency heads for its best first-quarter performance in eight years, outperforming gold even as inflation expectations rise.      Bitcoin was trading around $58,000 at press time, roughly double where it started 2021. That's the biggest first-quarter gain since 2013, when prices jumped by a whopping 600% in the January-to-March period, per CoinDesk 20 data.      An ounce of gold is currently changing hands at $1,685. The yellow metal has dropped 11% this quarter, marking its worst start to the year since 1982, as noted by market analyst Holger Zschaepitz.      The yellow metal's loss comes even as inflation has become one of the most central topics in traditional markets, with a growing number of Wall Street analysts, investors and economists worried it's the top risk following trillions of dollars of coronavirus-related stimulus from governments and central banks.      According to the data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, a key proxy for inflation expectations known as the U.S. five-year breakeven rate has risen sharply from 1.98% to 2.53% in the first three months, extending the ascent from the March 2020 low. The breakeven rate is the difference between yields on inflation-linked notes and those on standard notes with similar maturities.      Some market observers say investors are rotating funds out of gold and into bitcoin.      ""BTC just stealing the flows that should be going to gold in this macroclimate,"" BlockTower Capital founder and Chief Investment Officer Ari Paul said in a Twitter reply to Bloomberg's Joe Weisenthal on Tuesday.      Weisenthal, however, disputed the narrative, associating gold's decline with the rise in real or inflation-adjusted bond yields. The yellow metal has historically moved in the opposite direction to the real yields.      That said, one cannot ignore the growing institutional interest in bitcoin.      According to Arcane Research, bitcoin under management from exchange-traded investment vehicles has grown by 106,000 BTC or approximately 15% since Dec. 30, 2020. These products are now controlling 4.3% of the circulating bitcoin supply.      Further, as of mid-March, four public-listed companies – MicroStrategy, Tesla, Square, and Meitu – owned 40% of bitcoin's annual supply, as noted by Richard Byworth, CEO of Nasdaq-listed cryptocurrency exchange Diginex, in a Bloomberg interview.      The U.S. electric maker Tesla purchased bitcoin in January, becoming the first Fortune 500 Company to adopt the cryptocurrency as a reserve asset. Recently, the company's billionaire CEO Elon Musk announced that the carmaker would begin accepting payments in bitcoin.      Crypto market pundits are confident that other corporates would soon follow suit, propelling bitcoin to new heights.      The market is already facing a supply-side crisis due to the continued outflow of bitcoins from exchanges amid increased demand from large investors.      According to data provider Glassnode, the number of coins held on exchanges has declined by nearly 5% to 2.4 million in the first quarter and by 600,000 in the past 12 months.      ""Bitcoin investment vehicles have thus seen a growth of 450,000 BTC over the last year, contributing significantly to the declining exchange balance,"" Arcane Research's latest weekly note says.      The odds, therefore, appear stacked in favor of continued price rally in the second quarter – a historically strong period.      Some options traders are positioning for a rally to $80,000 by the end of April. Meanwhile, a few chart analysts are anticipating a rally at least to $70,000.

The Canadian miner recently purchased $30 million worth of Nvidia’s crypto-focused graphics cards (GPUs) to mine ether and other cryptocurrencies.

Leveraging multiple blockchains, venues and MEV opportunities, Luxor Switch can deliver top miners, such as Hut 8 with extra return for their hashrate,” Luxor CFO Ethan Vera told CoinDesk.    Ethereum mining: dead end or new beginning?    Ethereum’s DeFi summer of 2020 and NFT spring of 2021 have been boons for miners, as transaction fees on the network ballooned alongside token valuations.

According to a press release shared with CoinDesk, Enjin has secured $18.9 million in a private token sale led by Crypto.com Capital, DFG Group and Hashed.      Additional support for the raise came from Hypersphere, BlockTower, Blockchain.com Ventures, Fenbushi, Iconium, HashKey, Arrington XRP Capital, DeFi Alliance, among others, in what represents continued investor interest in non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as a gateway to mainstream adoption.      The funding was conducted via a new token, dubbed EFI, which Enjin says has been created as a currency for transaction fees that yield farmers can earn by staking Enjin Coin (ENJ) on Efinity. (ENJ is currently the 51st-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, according to CoinGecko.)      Enjin told CoinDesk it is transitioning to Polkadot in order to distance Efinity from soaring gas fees on the Ethereum network and increase scalability for NFTs. Efinity is slated for release sometime this year.      “Building with Polkadot will enable us to deliver an accessible, scalable solution that empowers everyone to participate in the emerging NFT economy,” said Enjin COO Caleb Applegate.

The startup, which incorporated in February after its team realized the data-mining website had outgrown hobby level, found pre-seed backers in Castle Island Ventures, Notation Capital and the sports tech VC Drive by DraftKings, Christian Dittmeier, one of the three co-founders, told CoinDesk.      The round underscores how Dapper Labs’ hyper-popular digital trading cards are fostering a side economy dedicated to providing market data to the ballooning user base. Some users now have tens of millions of dollars wrapped up in NBA Top Shot moments and the NFT sector's market cap recently eclipsed $1 billion.    Read more: Michael Jordan Joins $305M Investment in Firm Behind NBA Top Shot    But the official marketplace’s price analysis tools failed to meet the expectations of Dittmeier and co-founders Alex Ramirez and Cody Bouche when they started buying packs in mid-January, Dittmeier said. For starters, there was nothing on the site to show their investment appreciation over time.      The founders’ moments “were worth, like, eight times what we paid but there was nothing on [NBA Top Shot] that indicated that,” Dittmeier said, “so we started to kind of get the data for ourselves so that maybe, you know, we could make better investment decisions.”      Dittmeier, a data engineer, began plugging price data into a mock-up while Bouche pieced together an API and Ramirez built out the front end for what would become Evaluate.market. Seven weeks later their hobby, now a company, touts 17,000 registered users and prominent links on Top Shot’s moments pages, he said.      Evaluate.market is now raising cash to expand its team as its founders more closely integrate with Dapper’s Flow blockchain. Next week they will replace their pricing tool’s periodical moment price updates with real-time data bridges.      In the long term, the team, which is newly bullish on NFTs, wants to chart a future that can survive the tireless NFT churn, whether that be through more Flow pricing tools or an expansion to the more popular Ethereum blockchain.      “It's the hardest question right because sometimes the hype cycles for NFTs are super short so we don't want to do a bunch of dev time to like, you know, kind of be behind the cycle in terms of popularity,” Dittmeier said. “We want to be multi-NFT by the end of the year.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | FLOW,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/03/31/nba-top-shot-data-site-raises-16m-to-bring-visibility-to-your-nft-bags,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/40cecc71c0a08c160cc58757cdb4e43ca7011a1f-1500x1007.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

He shot down assertions that any CBDC could win a geopolitical reserve currency catfight “owing to its digital nature alone.”      The comments highlight growing international intrigue over how digital currencies might shape the world’s two largest economies and their global monetary prominence. China’s digital yuan, perhaps the largest and most advanced CBDC project to date, is already being rolled out while the Federal Reserve continues to explore the concept of a digital dollar.      This dichotomy has fueled speculation in come circles that the digital yuan has global ambitions. Indeed, CoinDesk reported last week on China’s quiet efforts to pilot digital currency trading platforms abroad, a soft power play with potentially more than just currency reserve status at stake.      Read more: How China’s Digital Yuan Could Go Global      For Carstens, chief of the self-described “bank for central banks,” the goal remains fostering a more closely connected financial world even if that means through CBDCs. He brought that to bear in a Wednesday presentation that was long on international collaboration and traded heavily on the wonkish monetary details that may give digital money an edge.    Wonkish monetary details    Retail CBDCs could do away with fast payment systems (FPS), a catch-all for the seemingly instantaneous (though in reality loan-like and in some cases vulnerable-to-clogging) clearing and settlement systems underpinning bank-to-merchant transactions, Carstens said.      “CBDC payments are never subject to any credit risk,” he said.      The “immediate finality” of CBDCs could also simplify institutional transfers. This remains true whether the CBDC is a token-based system (like bitcoin) or an account-based one (credit card payments), he said.      Carstens contrasted FPSs, which allow customers to transact in commercial bank liabilities, with CBDCs, which are liabilities of the central bank. Most countries will see this as a distinction without a difference but Carstens allowed that it could pose a “major issue” in certain states, though he named none.      Average citizens could utilize retail CBDCs without ever having to think about all that in-the-pipes chicanery under the model Carstens put forth. He said digital wallets, the CBDC access points, could mimic prevailing digital platforms’ required regulatory screens. Similarly, “largely invisible back-end arrangements” could link those wallets to the user’s banks and credit cards for funding.      Despite being a central bank liability, retail CBDC would need buy-in from commercial banks because public and private banks “are joined at the hip” when it comes to payments, he said. “With CBDCs, central banks and commercial banks will need to find a balanced arrangement.”      Above all, Carstens emphasized his peers’ forays into programmable, digital central bank money should “do no harm” to their country's monetary system or to the citizens within it.      CBDC may foster competition (through lower fees) that strikes a blow to the reigning payment giants, just as big tech-led “digital disruptions” now dominate in places like China. But he cautioned this model results in a “walled garden” where data remains vulnerable.      Perhaps one surprise of Carstens’ speech came as the central banking chief mulled, briefly, whether CBDCs ought to pay interest. He did not elaborate other than to say the “important decision” would likely dictate the ultimate size of CBDCs and suggested CBDCs should remain “small” relative to their resident financial system.      Carstens said he strongly believes future financial systems will all but demand “seamless convertibility” between one country’s currency and another, an effort he said central bankers have grappled with for years.      But multi-system CBDCs (mCBDC) could give those monetary wonks a “clean slate” for tackling the tangled issues that currently plague correspondent banking. Perhaps they could bridge their systems through a “shared technical interface,” he said.      Central bankers in 46 countries revealed in a recent BIS survey they were indeed considering mCBDC features, Carstens said.      The survey also indicated many central banks are open to eventually letting foreigners use their countries’ still mostly hypothetical CBDC, although most respondents had yet to decide. Respondents were relatively unfazed by the prospect of their CBDCs taking off abroad.      Controlling against that outcome is easiest via account-based CBDCs where the central bank retains a hold, and indeed Carstens said most public proposals have honed away from the token model. Token CBDCs face more promising prospects at a smaller scale.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/03/31/digital-yuan-wont-give-china-first-mover-advantage-with-cbdcs-bis-chief-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f22784496343b629869f45c7f6d1a6d1650814bf-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Off the Chain Capital and Foundry, the mining arm of CoinDesk' parent company DCG, led the two oversubscribed rounds, which included a handful of other investors. The raise lifts the one-year-old mining firm’s total funding to $75 million.      Based in Austin, Texas, Blockcap has bought 42,000 ASIC miners from Bitmain and Canaan so far, 12,000 of which are operational.

These facilities, scattered across the U.S., use a variety of renewables and fossil fuels to power machines with 46% renewables penetration, according to Darin Feinstein, founder of both Blockcap and CoreScientific. CoreScientific's facilities provide Feinstein and his team with access to up to 500MW of power, he said.    North American bitcoin mining    Many megalithic mining farms reside in the backyards of China’s hydro-rich regions, but bitcoin miners like Blockcap in the western hemisphere have been scaling operations in a bid to compete.      Per data from Statist, roughly 65% of Bitcoin hashrate comes from Chinese mining pools, while only 8% comes from the United States and Canada.      North American mining stocks have experienced booming valuations this bull market as many raise money to purchase more mining machines and operational space. Some of these companies, like Great American Mining and Upstream Data have carved out niches with oil and gas producers by furnishing them with mining rigs to turn otherwise flared/vented gas into hashrate.      Others, like Riot, Hut 8, Blockstream and Marathon, have raised money or taken on debt to build out megafarms.      As more mining firms plant their axes in North American soil, Feinstein anticipates that old-timers and newcomers alike will continue to tap renewables as a source of power for their machines.

""I disagree that there is a flag pattern because there is no real 'flagpole' preceding the consolidation phase that has been resolved to the upside,"" Katie Stockton, a technical analyst for Fairlead Strategies, told CoinDesk in an email.      The debate has reached such a fever pitch that it was trending Tuesday on the social-media site Reddit:      The controversy comes as bitcoin continues to draw all manner of bullish predictions, from all corners of the market, having rallied six-fold since October. While some analysts have modeled out long-term price forecasts of $100,000 or even $1 million based on a range of methods, few traders are currently calling for a rally to $70,000 in the short term.      According to the original post on Bitcoinist, the cryptocurrency broke out of its bull flag pattern on Tuesday, signaling the end of a two-week-long price consolidation phase and marking a resumption of the broader uptrend.      Under the theory of chart analysis, also known as technical analysis, a flag breakout signals an asset is likely to move upwards, roughly on the scale of the preceding bull move, which is known as the pole. In this case, the breakout has created an opening for prices to move toward $70,000 or beyond, according to Gola.      Bill Noble, chief technical analyst at Token Metrics, a cryptocurrency research company, mostly agreed with the Bitcoinist post in an email, saying the pattern does look like a bull flag on the four-hour chart.      ""If you look at the four-hour chart, the bull flag appears as a parallel channel,"" he said. ""In my mind, this makes the pattern very clear.""      ""Simply put, the recent consolidation in BTC is a pause that refreshes,"" according to Noble. ""Depending on what time frame you use for the measurement, the upside target for BTC could be either $75,000 as per the four-hour chart or $80,000 per the daily chart.""      However, some analysts say the pattern does not qualify as a bull flag, and traders are running ahead of themselves in making bold predictions based on it.      The rally seen in the first two weeks of March should have been much steeper or bigger in magnitude to qualify as the flag's pole, according to Stockton. What appears instead is a pole almost equal to the size of the so-called flag.      ""For it to be a flag, in my opinion, the early-March rally would have been steeper, and new highs would have been registered versus the high point of the consolidation phase,"" she said.      Gola, when asked for his response to the critique, told CoinDesk in a LinkedIn chat that the price structure looks like a bull flag despite the pole not being steep enough.      He said the price projection was supported by news developments this week, including the payment giant Visa's announcement that it will process transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, along with PayPal's plan to roll out a cryptocurrency check-out service across some 29 million online merchants. Both were seen as signs of growing mainstream adoption of digital assets, which could be broadly beneficial to the bitcoin market.      “I professed my upside bias based on rising volumes, as the price rose on daily timeframes before entering a consolidation period,” Gola said. “Also, the bull flag works in conjugation with supportive fundamentals, including the latest PayPal and Visa announcement. We need to look at all the sides.""      ""Anyway, it is a humble opinion, not an outright claim,"" he said.      Even if traders agree that bitcoin's bull flag has appeared in the price chart, there's still lingering doubts over whether the breakout is confirmed yet, according to Eddie Tofpik, head of technical analysis and senior markets analyst at London-based ADM Investor Services International Ltd.      ""Minimum of two consecutive UTC closes"" are required above the flag hurdle before the breakout is confirmed, Tofpik said, and ""maybe more, given the nature of the market."" A ""UTC close"" refers to the price of bitcoin at midnight, Coordinated Universal Time. Since global cryptocurrency markets are always open, many traders use that time as a way of marking the end of one trading day and start of the next.      A price rejection around the March 15 all-time high, just above $61,000, could cause a reversion back down, Tofpik said.      Perhaps not a red flag, but a yellow one at the very least.

According to Prometheum CEO Aaron Kaplan, the ATS application is still pending at the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), but the company has built a system that allows brokerage firms and clearing firms to speak to each other easily in an effort to entice Wall Street companies to use a platform with which they’re familiar.      “It’s a Nasdaq on the blockchain,” Kaplan told CoinDesk in an interview.      Adding more ATS platforms for the digital security market will give issuers more liquidity for their tokens, said Anchorage CEO Nathan McCauley. Last month, security token platform Tokensoft announced it would allow its issuers to trade their digital securities on tZERO, which uses Prime Trust as its custodian.

In an interview with Bloomberg on Wednesday, Lagarde said if ECB policy makers give the digital currency project the green light this summer then the digital currency will be rolled out within four years.  “We need to make sure that we do it right. We owe it to the Europeans. The whole process, let's be realistic about it, will in my view take another four years, maybe a little more,” said Lagarde.  In January, the European Commission and the ECB teamed up to consider potential issues that could arise from the digital euro before a decision is made to kick off development this summer.  The ECB said it will release the feedback on the potential launch of the digital currency from a public consultation in which 8,000 participants responded.  This will be sent to the European Parliament and then the ECB’s decision-making Governing Council to decide whether to move forward with its practical experimentation of the digital euro.

42386315,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBST7P,1617190200,"Valid Points: Yes, Front-Running Will Still Exist on Ethereum 2.0","Maximal extractable value (MEV) is quickly becoming a buzzword among Ethereum developers and traders alike, given the recent rise of decentralized finance (DeFi).      Congruently, the finish line for Ethereum 2.0’s consensus mechanism swap is within sight. Colloquially called “The Merge,” mining on Ethereum is likely to fall by the wayside within the next year or so in favor of staking. Doing so opens up a host of questions, particularly for those completing complex trades on Ethereum.      While GPU mining is likely to go away, MEV most likely won’t, according to a new report from research group Flashbots. Also called “miner” extractable value, MEV is crypto’s version of Wall Street front-running. Yes, that’s the same front-running strategy that brought a Massachusetts day trader to testify before Congress for his role in shorting big name hedge funds into the ground.    MEV, front-running and the race to be first    On a more technical level, MEV is all about transaction sequencing: who gets to be first in line to settle a transaction on-chain. Being first increases the odds of netting a profit on an arbitrage trade across various DeFi markets. And traders are willing to pay handsomely to be first in line by bidding up gas fees. Indeed, Flashbots data site shows some $40 million in MEV-based extracted value, when transaction fees are included.      As Flashbots states, under the current schematics Eth 1.x clients will still be in charge of ordering transactions, similarly to how miners order transactions using Eth 1.x software. The Beacon Chain will only finalize these transactions by attesting and validating them via its staking network. Flashbots does state that validators, who act as block proposers, will eventually be capable of extracting MEV from traders as the final arbiter of a transaction.      That simple explanation leaves out a lot of open questions, however. The Beacon Chain processes transactions over a period of time called an “epoch,” which is divided into slots for nestling transactions. Epochs run about 6.4 minutes long and block proposers are given their positions ahead of time.      Searchers – those who look for MEV opportunities – could have a longer time to find profitable trades, given the heads-up block proposers have compared to the current Ethpow blockchain. So, it's possible the race to outbid other traders becomes more crowded on Eth 2.0 than Ethpow.      Overall, MEV will work nearly the same as it does on Eth 2.0: The more technically inclined remain at an advantage over all others.    Pulse check: How Zelda, our Ethereum validator, is doing this week    If you’re new to “Valid Points” and the topic of Ethereum 2.0 in general, be sure to check out our 101 explainer on Eth 2.0 metrics to get up to speed about terminology used throughout this newsletter.      Zelda – CoinDesk’s very own Eth 2.0 validator node – continues to cook up attestations.      Per Beaconcha.in, Zelda is nearing 8,000 attestations of the Beacon Chain. One day these attestations will secure value on the Beacon Chain, but for now they merely signal agreement on a block being finalized with other validators.      Sadly, Zelda has not been chosen in the past week to propose a block. So far, our little validator has proposed only two blocks in return for 0.2354 ETH, worth $433 at time of writing.      Let’s do a little napkin math for CoinDesk to break even. At a current rate of proposing one block per 20 days, CoinDesk needs about 271 block propositions, or 5,437 days, to make back on our initial ether investment.      Of course, those numbers are bound to change as validators join the network – and that's assuming no malfeasance on Zelda’s part. This quick calculation also doesn’t include attestation rewards which Zelda is also reaping. As a reminder, all profits from Zelda will be donated to charity.

Results were helped by management fees generated by exchange-traded products (ETPs), which increased 137% to £7.1 million (US$9.8 million) in Q4 compared to the year-ago period figure of £3 million ($4.1 million).  The digital asset manager, which began trading on the Nasdaq First North Growth Market on March 11, saw its assets under management (AUM) grow to £1.74 billion in 2020, an increase of 336% compared to £0.4 billion ($0.55 billion) the year before.  This has continued in 2021, with CoinShares’ AUM currently more than $4.5 billion.  These surges can be attributed to the crypto bull market which gathered pace toward the end of 2020, which CEO Jean Marie Mognetti described as “a tipping point on the journey of bitcoin and digital assets.”    See also: Billionaire Hedge Fund Mogul Alan Howard Is a Shareholder in CoinShares",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Jamie Crawley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/03/31/coinshares-q4-profit-more-than-doubled,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/416d383033fcb5a823374d8e49dd5a1d2dffb469-1300x816.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The car maker disclosed a bug in the open-source Bitcoin payment processor and wallet BTCPay Server, and it also helped the project’s team patch the flaw.      The electric vehicle and renewables company informed BTCPay's team of the bug after reviewing the project's GitHub last week. It affects users who boot BTCPay from “Docker Deployment, have a configured email server and enabled registration for users in Server Settings > Policies,” according to a post on BTCPay’s GitHub that included a software patch.      ""The security team did an audit and contacted us. We then focused on fixing most of the points they disclosed one by one. They are now helping us to improve our process for security related disclosure,” BTCPay founder Nicolas Dorier told CoinDesk.      The BTCPay team wrote in its GitHub post that more information on the bug would be disclosed in its next major release.      “We want to thank @teslamotors for filing a responsible disclosure, helping us with remediation, and handling the situation professionally. We also want to thank Qaiser Abbas, an independent web-security researcher, for an additional responsible vulnerability disclosure that was handled in this release,” BTCPay’s team wrote in the software release fixing the bug.    Tesla + BTCPay Server?    BTCPay's team would not comment on why Tesla was reviewing the project's code or if Tesla uses its platform (or a clone of the software) for its bitcoin payments. The code for the bitcoin checkout's invoices, however, shows traces of the same code found in most BTCPay invoices, and Elon Musk has said that the company uses an open-source software to process payments.      BTCPay Server was launched in 2017 by Dorier, a Bitcoin developer, in response to popular Bitcoin payment processor BitPay’s controversial statements regarding the 2016 SegWit soft fork. Since launching, BTCPay has been integrated as a donations portal for charitable efforts around the world, including Nigeria and Venezuela.      The wallet is also used by many Bitcoin industry merchants and companies as a point of sale for online stores.
