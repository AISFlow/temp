42381424,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX95lQx,1545753648,"Layoffs Underway Amid 'Adjustments,' Bitcoin Miner Bitmain Confirms","Months after it filed an application to go public on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, Beijing-based cryptocurrency mining giant Bitmain is undergoing a series of business changes that extend even to its China offices, the company confirmed Tuesday.  ""There has been some adjustment to our staff this year as we continue to build a long-term, sustainable and scalable business. A part of that is having to really focus on things that are core to that mission and not things that are auxiliary,"" a company representative said in a statement.  The discussion of the company cutting off staff first emerged on Maimai, China’s equivalent to LinkedIn, where one anonymous user posted a thread on Dec. 17 asking if anyone had insider information about a possible layoff at Bitmain soon.  The post has generated nearly 200 replies since then, some of which came from other users that appear to be verified Bitmain employees on the social network, who indicated the layoffs would start from the week of Dec. 24.  “It’s affirmative. The layoff will start next week and involves more than 50 percent of the entire Bitmain’s headcount,” replied one verified Bitmain staff on Maimai to the thread.  “Some departments have to be let go entirely,” replied another verified Bitmain employee on the same thread.  Currently, some Bitmain employees have already taken to the social network to discuss their respective layoff compensation packages since the week began. An employee from Bitmain's China offices, who is still with the company and who spoke to CoinDesk under the condition of anonymity, confirmed the mining giant is indeed undergoing layoff at the moment.  Since it is still an ongoing process, the source said it’s unclear how many people have been impacted so far and was not able to verify the claim of 50 percent layoff.  “But the whole thing certainly couldn’t be handled in just one day given the total number could be large,” the source said, adding:  “This is an operational adjustment. Some projects will be entirely gone so it’s hard to calculate a precise percentage at this stage.”  The source added this round of operational adjustments has an impact on virtually all business units of Bitmain, including its flagship mining pool product.  “It’s not hard to infer which division is suffering the most. Bitmain’s core business is making miners. Other business lines are just blockchain and artificial intelligence,” the source said, implying the firm is having a major revamp on its push into the blockchain and AI field.  “There’s also some adjustment on the mining equipment business line. For the firm as a whole, it’s going to reduce redundancy to increase operational efficiency,” the source added.  The news makes Bitmain another major industry company that is undergoing reshuffles amid months of cryptocurrency market decline, joining others such as ConsenSys and Steemit. Previously, layoffs were confirmed by Bitmain, but outside of mainland China, where the firm's core operations are based.  However, the source said even without the overall market decline, this round of adjustment was inevitable, due to an extraordinarily fast expansion Bitmain has seen this year.  “Now Bitmain has about 3,100 people, even several hundreds more than what was disclosed in the IPO prospectus in September. But there were only about 1,000 people at the beginning of the year,” the source said, adding the growth rate is like two to three times in general.  “For some specific business lines, the expansion growth rate could be more than three times,” the source added.  Bitmain said also that it is still hiring, despite the layoffs, adding: ""As we move into the new year, we will continue to double down on hiring the best talent from a diverse range of backgrounds.""

42381446,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX95len,1545751809,It's Time for Local Governments to Break Blockchain's Regulatory Gridlock,"Politician Won Hee-ryong is the current governor of South Korea's Jeju province.  The following is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk’s 2018 Year in Review. It has been translated to English from Korean.  Although there are issues with blockchain that need to be solved, there is a growing consensus about the technology’s great potential. Blockchain is a disruptive technology that is not limited to any particular field, and it has a wide range of applications including finance, logistics, medicine and intellectual property rights.  Combining blockchain with cryptocurrencies is an inevitable step to fully utilize the technology’s potential. Blockchain lends creditability to cryptocurrencies, while cryptocurrencies enable a diverse range of business models that can help to drive blockchain’s growth.  However, the new service models enabled by cryptocurrencies conflict with existing economic and financial systems. This is especially true of initial coin offerings (ICOs), where cryptocurrency is issued in the early stages of a blockchain business to raise capital.  Countries around the world are grappling with the issue of how to draw up laws and institutions to resolve this conflict. Many countries are enacting separate systems to regulate cryptocurrencies and ICOs, or attempting to bring ICOs under the umbrella of existing institutions through the interpretation of securities laws.  In Korea, all forms of ICOs have been banned since September last year. However, since no clear follow-up legislation has been enacted, cryptocurrencies and ICOs are yet to be properly integrated into the market. The uncertainty caused by this situation has left many companies to move overseas, leading to a decline in the domestic industry.  Against this background, I spoke with the central government and the Blue House on two occasions in August this year to make a formal recommendation of turning Jeju into a special blockchain zone.  In order to achieve this, I remain involved in working level negotiations with the central government through the Ministry of Economy and Finance, Financial Services Commission and the Presidential Committee on the Fourth Industrial Revolution.  Local Action, National Vision  When it comes to the blockchain industry, Jeju Province’s primary goal is identifying and promoting a variety of blockchain projects through cooperation between the public and private sectors.  Jeju is currently involved in negotiations to introduce blockchain in a number of fields including traffic management, VAT refunds to foreign tourists and the management of scrap batteries. Overall, we believes that supporting the private sector to create a variety of service models is preferable to investing taxpayer money to build a blockchain complex and provide services led by the public sector.  Jeju Province’s second initiative is establishing a clear set of standards for cryptocurrencies and their issuance. This does not mean indiscriminate permission for ICOs or relaxing regulations. Instead, Jeju’s goal is to establish clear regulations and standards for ICOs within the boundaries of the region, and permit ICOs for healthy companies.  To achieve this, Jeju seeks to take advantage of its unique legal position under the ‘Jeju Special Law.’  As a free international city, Jeju aims to use its institutional autonomy to create a special regulatory zone for blockchain and cryptocurrencies, which represent new global industries and require an institutional foundation.  A regional special blockchain zone has two main advantages. The first is flexibility. As many different ICO models are rolling out including STO, IEO and DAICO, and the ‘token economy’ is evolving rapidly, a flexible regional approach is more conducive to enacting suitable regulations while engaging in regulatory experimentation than legislation on a national level.  Evolving At the Market's Speed  The second advantage we would have as a special blockchain zone is speed. The national legislative process is cumbersome and time-consuming.  On the other hand, if local governments are granted the authority to create their own rules and standards, ordinances can be enacted quickly to reduce market uncertainties in a short period of time. To foster the local industry, Jeju aims to take advantage of this flexibility and speed to set up clear standards and regulations on cryptocurrencies and their issuance.  Why are we moving now? From a long-term perspective, we are at the point where overheated expectations have settled down, and the market can be viewed from a more rational standpoint, making this the right time to establish proper institutions for blockchain and cryptocurrencies.  Yes, the blockchain and cryptocurrency markets are cooling down rapidly due to a sharp decline in cryptocurrency prices recently. The number of ICO projects is also falling at a substantial rate. Cryptocurrency skeptics believe that the current trend will ultimately lead to the demise of cryptocurrencies, as they have no inherent value.  However, others believe that the current situation merely represents the end of unrealistic expectations, and that the technology has now entered the ""death valley"" stage of the hype circle.  During this process, small but flexible innovations on a regional level can help to reduce the burden of creating national systems and provide a positive sense of direction.

42381436,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX95lg3,1545747642,So Long to the Clutter: A Cooling Crypto Market Will Bring Change We Need,"Sheila Warren is head of blockchain and distributed ledger technology at the World Economic Forum.  The following is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk’s 2018 Year in Review.  After about a year of market upheaval, a few things seem clear: blockchain technology is still best-suited to core use cases involving needs like censorship resistance, and a lot of nonsense has exited the market (albeit with a lot of cash in hand).  Still, many brilliant minds remain hard at work on solving some of the technology’s technical challenges. Various layer-two solutions, aimed at increasing the throughput and usability of blockchains, will likely emerge over the course of 2019. But what’s significantly less clear is the potential, if any, that blockchain technology actually holds for the achievement of positive social impact.  In this area, we are still waiting for the killer use case that truly leverages what the technology has to offer.  The good news is that, along with the cooling market, the hype around blockchain tech as being the “mother of all solutions” has finally started to quell, and we are starting to see a renewed focus on empowerment. Decentralization and democratization are arguably, two of the core principles at the root of the technology’s development.  In theory, we are able to include more voices in the community and reduce financial inequality by providing increased access to capital to a large variety of people. Increased inclusion in traditional systems, whether through those systems’ expansion or upheaval, remains one of the most exciting possibilities that this technology could bring about.  Access and Power  Many people dodge the word “power” (or substitute it with “wealth”), but blockchain technology has the potential to give citizen actors an enhanced stake in, and ability to influence, the systems that now control and entrap them, or that exclude them altogether. Harnessing this potential requires deep consideration of the policies that accompany any blockchain deployment, as well as consideration of everyone’s favorite topic: governance.  One trend we are seeing is the increasing skepticism of blockchain-backed “solutions” that are unilateral or bilateral in nature; failure stories abound, in many case irrespective of whether the proposed solutions are public or permissioned.  As a result, we’re starting to see more and more attention being paid to consortium models that bring together a multiplicity of actors to devise solutions that are ecosystem-wide (MOBI is one example of many). We’re also seeing new acknowledgment that a system can’t transform effectively unless the needs of a wide variety of stakeholders are considered.  This is part of the reason why the cryptocurrency world so quickly started to resemble traditional financial infrastructure.  In addition to a multi-stakeholder approach, which is slowly gaining traction, a robust and grounded policy framework is needed to ensure that the “neutral” qualities of this technology don’t simply replicate the problems of existing systems, as is already happening with cryptocurrency, with its often-opaque centralized intermediaries, market manipulation (both intentional and inadvertent) and over-the-counter trading desks, all of which mimic or replicate existing problems in the financial system.  As an example, because private key management remains challenging for the lay user, outsourced custody services have proliferated. In many cases, these services actually use the same methods as the legacy financial system, including bank vaults and safety deposit boxes.  New Attention, New Promise  Fortunately, ethicists, civil society, and other watchdogs are starting to pay attention and call out instances where things can go awry, or where there is a rapid default to the same-old intermediaries who inject the same-old biases into the system.  At the Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution, we’re focused on piloting policies that leverage some of blockchain’s core attributes, such as increased access to information. For example, we are conducting a pilot in Colombia focused on reducing corruption via deployment of a blockchain-based system that enhances transparency.  Of course, it’s not at all obvious that increased transparency of information or process flows will lead to more accountability in a system; on the contrary, there are numerous examples of cases where enhanced transparency simply led to increased exploitation by bad actors. Thus, our project focuses on the creation of a formal policy framework that heavily influences design decisions.  We are engaging a diverse stakeholder group, comprised of government officials, civil society, media and other watchdog groups, businesses, academics and the specific stakeholders affected by corruption in the public procurement process. Our initial pilot focuses on the provision of food to schools, and as part of the affected stakeholder group, we are engaging with schools, parents’ associations, teachers’ associations, and students themselves.  While this approach adds time and complexity to any pilot, the accountability created by this methodology will help mitigate the risk of unintended consequences and ensure that the promises of blockchain technology can be realized within this specific context. Put succinctly, we seek to import community-driven technology methodology into our policy and technical build.  Our goal is to craft policy that provides meaningful multi-party access to reliable information (via a blockchain) that will help flag instances of potential or actual corruption with defined consequences (potentially via smart contracts). Who will obtain access to information, and when, and for what purpose? How do we meaningfully anonymize identity to protect people who want to report instances of potential or actual corruption?  All of these questions will be addressed in both the policies and in the technical build. While our pilot will necessarily be context-specific, we keep an eye on scaling potential so that the policies we craft can be used to fight corruption in other geographies and under different circumstances.  Of course, we're a long way from revolution, but the same has been true of every major transformation throughout history.  Change happens in fits and starts. Now that we’ve cleared some of the clutter, we can get back to the things that make this technology interesting from a social perspective in the first instance, but this time with more humility about the limitations and challenges.
