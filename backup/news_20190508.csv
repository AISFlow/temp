42381840,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9pvGb,1557351651,'A Loan Shark Situation': MakerDAO Is Leaving Crypto Borrowers With Rising Bills,"The Takeaway  An ethereum protocol for programmatic lending, MakerDAO emerged as a clear market leader in part for its rock-bottom interest rates of 0.5 percent.  But the code behind MakerDAO requires interest rates to do more than extract business from borrowers, it's a technological necessity for keeping its DAI stablecoin worth $1.  With interest rates rising to 19.5 percent, and DAI still worth below $1, some early borrowers are angry, feeling as though they were misled.  Describing the project's marketing tactics as akin to digital ""loan sharks,"" they argue their experience with decentralized finance has been worse than with traditional banking.      When credit cards give borrowers an unusually good deal, the companies tell cardholders how long that deal is going to last. In the world of crypto, however, that practice hasn't exactly ported over.  That's becoming more relevant given recent changes in the market that have created a rise in the number of companies offering loans in cryptocurrency as part of their business model. So far, this includes startups with traditional products (they hold crypto and loan cash) as well as blockchain protocols offering more exotic fare.  The leader in the latter category is undoubtedly MakerDAO, a years-in-the-making protocol built on ethereum that programmatically enables borrowers to take out loans, called collateralized debt positions (CDPs), with code. To date, 2 million ether is locked up in the protocol, and $82 million in DAI, the protocol's stablecoin, are in the market now, all backed by active loans.  But while investors and developers love to tout MakerDAO as perhaps the best-working example in the evolving field of decentralized finance (DeFi), some borrowers don't feel as if they've gotten as good of a deal.  In fact, the cost of borrowing on MakerDAO has risen rapidly recently and this has been especially painful for those who took out loans in order to make consumer purchases (rather than to make leveraged crypto investments).  Since early February, the cost of the fees associated with these loans has gone from an annual rate of 0.5 percent to 19.5 percent as of this writing. It might not be done rising either.  Less discussed is how that affects everyone using the platform, as rates on loans originated at the lower rate rise when the protocol's fees are adjusted (a process controlled by the owners of another token, MKR).  Inside MakerDAO, this cost is referred to as the ""stability fee,"" though in practice it's known by a much more familiar term: interest. The fee reflects the interest on debt lent out against cryptocurrency collateral.  That interest started too low and rose too high to serve consumer use cases in the opinion of one borrower, named Walter, who spoke to CoinDesk on the condition that we not use his full name. He wrote CoinDesk in an email:  ""I believe that MakerDao was aware that in order to defend the stability of their coin the interest rates would have to vary wildly and as such it would be impossible for them to support real use cases. It was their responsibility to warn users that their loans are NOT suited for real-world use cases, and they might end up trapping users in the rates we see now.""  MakerDAO representatives did not answer questions or provide a formal statement as of press time.  Borrowers feeling the pinch  It's not the fact that MakerDAO's interest rates changed, so much as how fast it all happened.  Walter borrowed on MakerDAO as a crypto believer since 2017. He saw this post in January about a MakerDAO user who refinanced $50,000 worth of his mortgage using a CDP, dropping the interest rate on that portion of his debt from 4 percent to 0.5 percent.  Convinced, Walter told CoinDesk he took out 58,500 in DAI to pay off an auto loan and fund a personal event. He took out several tranches over the course of January, when rates were at their lowest.  He wrote CoinDesk:  ""Borrowing using my ETH looked like a safe solution to saving money and retaining ownership of my ETH, but there was no clear indication and no warning how quickly and how steep rates can come back.""  With ETH prices frequently dropping, the loan is constantly in danger of being liquidated, which would eliminate his debt but also cost him what has become a much higher interest payment plus the liquidation penalty (13 percent of his principal).  Now, those low rates look like a way the project ensnared early users. Walter doesn't see the increases as malicious, but it doesn't matter. ""What matters is, in the end, you end up in a loan shark situation,"" he said.  Another borrower who spoke to CoinDesk, named Josh, said that he took about $20,000 to take a break from working in the technology industry and travel in Eastern Europe. Again, he had to make the choice between taking out a traditional consumer loan or using MakerDAO.  ""Getting consumer credit, I'd be getting something like 10 or 15 percent through a bank,"" Josh told CoinDesk.  In that case, MakerDAO seemed like a natural choice.  ""My expectation was: Maybe it will go a bit up, but it's [now] like a 40-fold increase. I don't think anyone would expect that,"" he said.  Again, Josh told us that he understood the rates could be variable but didn't expect they could make a dramatic spike. Now he's paying more than he would have if he'd simply gone the traditional banking route.  With an extremely well-capitalized CDP, Josh is unlikely to face liquidation. That said, he does expect to cut his time off short and take a job again sooner than he had planned.  He said:  ""It was like: let's liberate from the banks and all this shit and now we're in the same situation.""  According to Walter, the two borrowers are not alone. He told CoinDesk that he's in touch with several more borrowers.  ""There's a bunch of folks that have taken relatively small loans, but for them, they might be quite substantial as a fraction of their income,"" Walter said.  What are the rules?  The question now is, do borrowers paying interest to the protocol enjoy any protections, and if so, what are they?  ""What is this? What if any laws govern it? What if any laws should govern it?"" Margot Saunders, senior counsel at the National Consumer Law Center, told CoinDesk. ""Unquestionably it's a loan.""  The way laws around lending tend to work in the U.S., Saunders explained, is that the reason for the loan indicates which laws apply, and laws protecting consumers tend to be more restrictive than laws protecting people leveraging investments.  ""I think there is at least an argument that Truth in Lending or at least margin account rules would apply to these transactions,"" Saunders argued. The Truth in Lending Act governs disclosures to consumers about the cost of different kinds of financial products. It's difficult to make broad statements about a financial product used in many different ways, from the perspective of U.S. law.  On MakerDAO, people use it both as consumers and as investors. No one can say for sure how much of either kind of lending goes on because no one needs to provide that kind of information.  That openness speaks to MakerDAO's origins in the early days of ethereum, when creators were more interested in what was possible than what was permitted. Which may explain why one borrower was able to cheerfully take out a loan late last year despite not being 18 years old yet.  Still, MakerDAO's easy access days could be numbered. At Austin's SXSW in March, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s Valerie Szczepanik, the agency's point person on crypto, specifically singled out algorithmic stablecoins as a category that's very likely to be viewed as a security by her agency.  Saunders noted, ""These are obviously new transactions and we are going to have some healthy litigation over it.""

Police arrested the two Israeli citizens - Tal Prihar, 37, and Michael Phan, 34 — on Monday. Prihar, who lived in Brazil, was taken in France while police arrested Phan in Israel. TechCrunch posted the just-unsealed U.S. indictment Wednesday.  The authorities are calling DeepDotWeb's affiliate system a ""kickback"" scheme, suggesting that the pair received cash for giving dark web exchanges more business. The two also allegedly used bitcoin to hide their tracks, and the indictment's section on asset forfeiture says they had accounts at crypto exchanges OKCoin and Kraken and payment processor BitPay.  Prosecutors allege that the pair made 8,155 bitcoins in total over a period of years from this activity and estimate their total haul at $15.4 million.  ""To conceal and disguise the nature and source of the illegal proceeds, totaling over $15 million, Prihar and Phan transferred their illegal kickback payments from their DDW bitcoin wallet to other bitcoin accounts and to bank accounts they controlled in the names of shell companies,"" wrote prosecutors.  “This is the single most significant law enforcement disruption of the dark net to date,” said Scott Brady, U.S. attorney for Western Philadelphia, in a press conference.

42381831,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9pv7n,1557344493,What a Bitcoin 'Reorg' Is and What Binance Has to Do With It,"What started with a single tweet quickly turned into an escalating debate Wednesday when the CEO of one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges appeared to entertain the idea of encouraging revisions to the bitcoin blockchain.  Following Wednesday's revelation that crypto exchange Binance was robbed of 7,000 BTC (worth about $40 million), a proposal was floated to conduct a transaction ""reorg"" on the bitcoin blockchain, sparking a fiery debate and community uproar.  The idea  was suggested a few hours after the world’s largest crypto exchange by volume was hacked when developer Jeremy Rubin, who has worked on bitcoin and Stellar's core code, tweeted to the founder and CEO of Binance:  “[Changpeng Zhao] if you reveal your private keys for the hacked coins... you can decentralized-ly at zero cost to you coordinate a reorg to undo the theft.”  Rubin essentially suggested that by getting a majority of miners onboard, the transaction history could be adjusted so that the funds are instead broken up and sent to them instead. This ""reorganization"" would come at some cost, but it would prevent the 7,000 BTC from staying in the hands of the hackers. Further, it wouldn't have constituted a pure rollback, or a reversal of the transaction history writ-large.  The idea was subsequently raised during an ask-me-anything session held by Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, sparking a round of speculation that ended with Zhao ultimately dismissing the idea.  As the tweet caught attention, the conversation quickly boiled over given the topic of discussion – there have been very few changes to the bitcoin blockchain's transaction history in its 10 years of operation, as doing so has been reserved for dire emergencies in which there may be critical consensus failures.  “To clarify, the proposal by [Rubin] and [James Prestwich] is to construct a [transaction] that would keep all other transactions and just distribute the hacker coins to miners,” tweeted Zhou. “It’s not: a rollback of any transaction, nor is it reverting funds back to Binance.”  The proposal caused an uproar on social media. As developer Udi Wertheimer tweeted in response:  “The idea that this rollback of days would even be practical at all for anyone involved is insane. A day of mining costs 1800 BTC. Rolling back four days costs more than the hack itself.”  Others seemed to agree that the sheer financial incentives for such a feat would simply be infeasible.  “The losses are still at a minimum [7,250] BTC,” wrote developer Jimmy Song about rough costs for Binance to sufficiently incentivize miners to rewrite part of the transaction history of the bitcoin network.  At the same time, infeasibility and impossibility are two separate matters. When explaining why Binance would ultimately not be pursuing a chain reorganization or “reorg” as suggested by Rubin, Zhou listed four separate reasons none of which had anything to do with the monetary cost.  “1. We may damage credibility of BTC. 2. We may cause a split in both the bitcoin network and community...3. The hackers did demonstrate certain weak points in our design and user confusion that was not obvious before. 4. While it was a very expensive lesson for us, it is nevertheless a lesson,” listed Zhou on Twitter.  Zhou’s reasoning highlighted a key concern many have voiced in the past when it comes to blockchain immutability not just on bitcoin but all proof-of-work (PoW) blockchains.  A thought experiment?  “If you bribe 51 percent of the miners, they will change the ledger for you. [This] tells you just how little irreversibility there is in PoW coins,” tweeted Cornell University professor and researcher in blockchain consensus protocols Emin Gün Sirer.  A 51% attack on the blockchain network is not a new attack vector for PoW blockchains. However, as highlighted by Gün Sirer, it’s also not really an attack vector. On very special instances, the majority of self-interested miners on PoW blockchains have voluntarily agreed to alter a transaction history to undo critical situations.  While the situation isn't entirely the same, in the past, blockchain networks have seen their histories altered in the wake of critical moments. This happened on the ethereum blockchain back in 2016 when over $60 million worth of coins were siphoned off from the now-defunct smart contract The DAO. It also happened on the vericoin blockchain back in 2014 after $8 million worth of coins were hacked.  While controversial, both decisions were supported by the primary developer community who launched system-wide upgrades or hard forks to enable otherwise infeasible amendments to the blockchain transaction history.  Yet those choices weren't without their repercussions; the resulting ethereum fork resulted in two distinct chains, ethereum and ethereum classic, respectively.  A resounding no  Still, many in the bitcoin community took to social media to deride the idea as both infeasible as well against the philosophical underpinnings of the technology.  In Binance's particular case, prominent members of the bitcoin community point out that bitcoin being the world’s largest blockchain is a particularly unique case with a reputation to uphold.  “Talk of forking or reorganizing the blockchain is close to heresy,” tweeted billionaire bitcoin investor Michael Novogratz. “When the ethereum community did it the project was like 5 months old. A baby. Bitcoin now has $100bn market cap and is a legitimate store of wealth.”  It would also be unfair according to Adam Back – CEO of bitcoin development startup Blockstream – given that the latest Binance hack is nowhere near as severe as previous hacks suffered on the bitcoin blockchain.  “A Bitcoin reorg is just not happening, and I doubt any Bitcoin industry, miners nor developers considered it either. Recall 2014 $473mil, 2016 bitfinex hack $72mil, 2019 binance $40mil etc. #NotHappening,” tweeted Back.

42381833,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9pvAJ,1557331262,Ethereum-Powered Social Network Cent Launches Payments via Chat,"Blogging platform Cent has launched a new feature that allows users to send each other the cryptocurrency ether via chat.  Announced Wednesday, the feature enables such payments even without downloading a crypto wallet like MetaMask. “You can just log on with an email, password and phone number,” Cent CEO Max Brody told CoinDesk.  Cent  offers a built-in custodial wallet, comparable to the payments feature in Facebook messenger, and the ability to sync up with MetaMask. The team aims to offer a familiar social media experience while “still utilizing the best parts of Web3,” said Steven McKie, an investor in Cent via Amentum Capital, using the term for the decentralized web.  Indeed, Cent investor Jake Brukhman of CoinFund framed the startup's mission in grand terms, telling CoinDesk:  “What Cent is doing long-term isn’t focused on tipping as much as the idea that people should be able to earn money online from their creativity, their art, their content.”  Stepping back, several publishing platforms are working to attract mainstream audiences with crypto payment features, from the journalism network Civil to the XRP-powered platform Coil. Beyond offering private chats with the ether payments feature, Cent also distinguishes itself from the pack with a unique tipping model.  Cent users “seed” content they like, basically speculating on its popularity. If, for example, a reader publicly tips $1 worth of ether to a blogger for a specific post, a quarter of the crypto goes to the content creator while the rest is divided among early readers who also “seeded” the post.  Earlier contributors who give larger amounts get a proportional fraction of the tip, which theoretically incentivizes fans to share and promote content because the more tips it attracts the more they also earn.  “The amount that you get depends on how much they gave,” Cent CTO Cameron Hejazi told CoinDesk.  Even before enabling this messaging feature, Cent was already gaining traction among ethereum fans. Up to 3,000 users transacted with ether through Cent over the past 30 days. During that time the top 10 bloggers, of which McKie is himself the leader, earned between $128–$399 each. Overall, Brody said, there is nearly $31,000 worth of ether loaded onto the platform.  “We get a lot of users from these other countries where they’ll have a family farm where they make their own food and they’ll have internet, but they won’t necessarily have big sources of income,” Brody said. “For those type of users, Cent can have a pretty significant impact.”  In conclusion, Hejazi added:  “Think of Cent more as a generalized transaction platform around any type of content. It could be that we’ll move into verticals like podcasts, photos, or video blogging. We just want to be the network that connects them, not just content-wise but socially and financially.”  Pennies image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | ETH,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2019/05/08/ethereum-powered-social-network-cent-launches-payments-via-chat,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9b21755f5463e718d785c864d58c77814656304c-1000x724.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The open industry platform was initiated by eight founding member banks with the aim of improving the trade finance process by simplifying letter of credit transactions to deliver speedy settlement times and resolution of discrepancies, as well as improved sanctions screening, according to an announcement from distributed ledger startup R3.  The tests saw firms across 27 countries use Voltron, which was developed by R3 using its Corda platform, to make simulated letter of credit transactions. While the existing process is paper-based and time-consuming, Voltron processes transactions in “under 24 hours” as compared to the 5-10 days it traditionally takes, R3 said.  The trial was delivered on Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform in a collaboration between Bain, CryptoBLK and R3.  R3 said 96 percent of the trial participants concluded that Voltron would help them improve trade finance processes and reduce costs.  Denis Dodon, head of innovations at participating member Alfa Bank, said:  “Everything is done in the same interface, which is connected to all the workflow participants, information is shared instantly, what will significantly expedite the transaction, optimizing working with documents, which could be rectified in an instant way should there be any discrepancies identified.”  The platform, R3 added, is “significantly faster, more reliable and cost-effective,” removing time-consuming reconciliation processes by providing a ""single, immutable record of a trade."" It also brings the added benefits of a reduction in fraud risk.  Calling for other banks and corporates to join the effort, R3 CEO David E. Rutter said the trial is a ""step closer to shaping what the future of trade finance looks like.""  Other participants in the trials included Societe Generale, CommerzBank, Commercial Bank of Qatar, MUFG, Natixis, National Bank of Egypt and the Saudi British Bank.

In a press release posted on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) website Wednesday, the struggling firm said that its new batch of 1,000 Bitmain Z11 miners came into production last week and that the directors expect margins to improve as a result.  Argo, which offers mining services via a subscription model, notably raised about $32.5 million via an IPO held last August. Its value has since plummeted, however, and, in its 2018 financial report, the firm disclosed a £4.1 million pre-tax loss (or $5.3 million USD).  With the new units in production, the firm is “confident” it will have around 400 bitcoins (valued at $2.3 million currently) on its balance sheet by the end of Q2. Mining costs, on the other hand, are estimated to increase to around £300,000 (or $391,000) for the quarter.  Jonathan Bixby, the firm’s executive chairman, said:  ""Argo expects to turn EBITDA [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization] break-even in the second half of this year.”  “We strongly believe that the cryptocurrency market has considerable long-term potential to become a major asset class and that the correct strategy is to continue to invest in mining infrastructure at current prices,"" he added.  The firm indicated it's also considering the purchase of an additional 1,000 Bitmain AntMiner S17s for about £1.7 million ($2.2 million) to be put into production in early July.  Last month, controversial oil tycoon Frank Timis was revealed to be the biggest shareholder in Argo and was attempting to oust executives at the firm. Argo appealed to shareholders to block the bid at the time.

42381848,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9pvQf,1557313238,Bitcoin Price Retreats But Bull Case Intact Above $5.7K,"View  With prices holding above Tuesday's low of $5,687, bitcoin remains on track for a break above $6,000.  Acceptance below $5,687 would validate the bullish exhaustion signaled by a ""shooting star"" candle that formed Tuesday and could yield a deeper drop to the 30-day moving average (MA), currently at $5,333.  The case for a deeper pullback would further strengthen if the current 3-day candle ends below $5,510.  Bitcoin's (BTC) bullish case is still intact after a pullback from 5.5-month highs, but prices must stay above key support at $5,700 to maintain that scenario.  The cryptocurrency market leader is currently trading at $5,820 on Bitstamp, down 2.5 percent from the 5.5-month high of $5,970 hit in the Asian trading hours on Monday.  Bitcoin, however, is still holding above the April 23 high of $5,623, meaning the most of basic of all bullish patterns – a higher high and higher low – is still valid.  The long-term bias also remains bullish, with the price holding well above the 21-month exponential moving average (EMA) at $5,296. So, the cryptocurrency remains on the hunt for a break above $6,000.  That said, BTC's retreat from the 5.5-month high of $5,970 to close Tuesday (UTC) at $5,751 is telling a tale of temporary bullish exhaustion. These early signs of a trend change would gain credence if BTC find acceptance below Tuesday's low of $5,687.  So far, however, sellers have not made their presence felt, allowing the price to hold above $5,687 despite a “large scale security breach"" at Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume. The startup announced on Tuesday that hackers had stolen over 7,000 bitcoins and that users won't be affected.  Daily chart  The series of higher highs and higher lows, ascending 5- and 10-day moving averages (MAs) and channel breakout on the relative strength index (RSI) seen above all indicate scope for a move above $6,000.  Even so, caution is warranted on the part of buyers as early signs of trend exhaustion have emerged on the daily chart.  To start with, BTC has failed four times in the last five days to close above the key resistance of $5,780 (June 2018 low).  Further, BTC created a shooting star candle on Tuesday, which occurs when a day begins on an optimistic note, but ends with sellers pushing the price back close to the day's open.  That candle is widely considered an early sign of a bullish-to-bearish trend change when it occurs after a prolonged rally and its upper shadow is at least twice as long as its body. That seems to be the case here.  Traders, however, usually wait for strong confirmation, preferably in the form of a sustained move below the low of the shooting star candle.  As a result, the case for a rally to $6,000 would weaken significantly, and the prospects of a deeper pullback to the crucial 30-day MA at $5,333 would improve, if BTC finds acceptance below $5,687 in the next 24 hours.  4-hour and 3-day charts  On the 4-hour chart (above left), the Chaikin money flow index, which measures the money flow volume over a set period of time (usually 21 days) to gauge buying and selling pressure, is consistently producing lower highs, contradicting higher highs in price.  That bearish divergence indicates a loss of upward momentum, which is evident from BTC's inability to produce a quick move above $6,000 despite the observed diamond-pattern breakout – a bullish continuation pattern.  A similar bearish Chaikin money flow and volume divergence are also seen on the 3-day chart. Further, it is worth noting that the previous three-day candle is a doji – another sign of bullish exhaustion.  The 30-day MA support at $5,333 may be breached if the current 3-day candle closes (Thursday, UTC) below $5,510, validating the doji candle.

42381839,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9pvFL,1557307866,Alleged Multibillion-Dollar Pyramid Scheme OneCoin Sued by Former Investor,"The notorious cryptocurrency investment scheme OneCoin, widely claimed to be a fraud, is being sued by a former investor over her losses.  The lawsuit, filed in New York Tuesday by law firm Silver Miller on behalf of the investor, Christine Grablis, alleges that OneCoin fraudulently promoted cryptocurrency investments and violated federal securities laws.  Grablis complains that she lost around $130,000 in the scheme and is seeking to have those funds returned, as well as damages. She is also seeking a class action on behalf of other investors who lost money through the scheme.  Complaints about OneCoin have been ongoing since at least as far back as 2016, when Belgium’s financial regulator issued a warning about the scheme. OneCoin functioned as a multi-level marketing scheme and was founded by an individual called Ruja Ignatova.  Given the huge amount said to have been lost to the scheme, various government authorities from across the world, including the U.K., Germany, India, Italy, Africa and China have also warned against or have moved to halt OneCoin's operations.  Prosecutors in China last year charged more than 100 individuals regarding the scheme, while Indian authorities arrested alleged promoters in 2017.  Most recently, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) indicted the leaders of the scheme, Ruja Ignatova and Konstantin Ignatov, on charges of wire fraud, securities fraud and money laundering.  Konstantin was arrested at the time, while Ruja remains at large, also facing charges in India for her role in the project.  SDNY U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman said at the time that “these defendants created a multibillion-dollar ‘cryptocurrency’ company based completely on lies and deceit,” adding:  “They promised big returns and minimal risk, but, as alleged, this business was a pyramid scheme based on smoke and mirrors more than zeroes and ones. Investors were victimized while the defendants got rich.”  Gavelhttps://www.shutterstock.com/image-aphoto/judges-gavel-law-booksconstitutional-crisis-782972068?src=u6_T3lbF7WtuvTsJ_QXevA-1-17 image via Shutterstock",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | REGULATION,Yogita Khatri,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/05/08/alleged-multibillion-dollar-pyramid-scheme-onecoin-sued-by-former-investor,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/de6971abae4764e38250424b616a08af6e3f748f-1900x1268.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42381830,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9pv5H,1557305116,Bitfinex Releases Official White Paper for $1 Billion Exchange Token Offering,"Cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex has released the official white paper for its $1 billion exchange token sale, revealing it will also launch a dedicated platform for projects to raise funds via similar initial exchange offerings (IEOs) starting from next month.  Bitfinex published the white paper Wednesday, confirming recent reports that it's aiming to raise up to $1 billion worth in the tether (USDT) stablecoin by selling its own exchange token, dubbed LEO, in a private sale.  However, the white paper indicated the private sale will end on May 11, not the previously reported May 10. Further, it appears Bitfinex may not necessarily conduct a public sale if it fails to raise $1 billion during the private phase.  ""If fewer than 1 billion USDT tokens are sold by private token sale, the Issuer may thereafter sell remaining tokens at times and in a manner it deems appropriate in its sole discretion, consistent with applicable law,"" the white paper reads.  Bitfinex said it will launch its first IEO allowing other projects to raise funds in June. “Qualified” persons with a Bitfinex or Ethfinex account may contribute to pre-vetted token sales directly from their personal exchange wallet.  The paper states:  “Projects that successfully raise capital on this platform are subsequently listed on the two exchanges, as permitted by applicable law, and token sale participants receive their subscribed tokens in their exchange wallets. The first token sale is scheduled for June 2019.”  Further, Bitfinex claimed it will also be launching a licensed and regulated security token exchange, which will not be available to U.S. customers.  Bitfinex's own LEO token will be issued by Unus Sed Leo Limited, a new company owned by Bitfinex's parent company iFinex, as previously stated in a marketing document.  Bitfinex and Tether Ltd., the stablecoin issuer affiliated with the exchange, are currently being sued by the state of New York for allegedly covering up a $850 million loss in customer funds. Bitfinex later claimed that the funds had been “seized” by various authorities and that it was working to retrieve the funds.  Elsewhere in the white paper, the exchange also lists forthcoming projects, including a derivatives product. “The product will have USDT-based collateral (unavailable in the rest of the market), up to 100x leverage and isolated margin for individualized risk level,” it says.

42381845,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9pvO9,1557298842,"Staking, Ethereum’s Mining Alternative, Will Be Profitable – But Barely","The Takeaway  Ethereum is soon to abandon bitcoin-style proof-of-work (PoW) mining in favor of a long-in-development alternative system called proof-of-stake (PoS), but the economics are still being worked out.  Under a proposal by creator Vitalik Buterin, computer operators who validate transactions would be able to earn 5 percent annual on a minimum 32 ETH (~$5,500) investment, or roughly $260, at present prices.  The profitability of computer operators who validate transactions is deemed by some analysts to favor those who run their own hardware as opposed to relying on cloud services.      Computer operators helping to validate transactions in a forthcoming version of ethereum – dubbed ethereum 2.0 – will see positive returns on their investment but not much, according to new data.  According to newly proposed numbers by ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin, validators – which are what miners are called in ethereum 2.0 – are projected to earn around 5 percent annually on their 32 ether (ETH) investment. At present ether prices, this would be an annual return of roughly $260.  However, factor in hardware, electricity and other additional overhead costs of running a validator on ethereum 2.0 and the annual profit margin drops down to roughly $41 or a net yield of 0.80 percent. Assuming ether prices at $160, under the old issuance schedule, the net yield would have been -1.87 percent, according to global token strategist for Consensys Collin Myers.  “When you include the expenses of running your own machine in your own home, the net yield is 0.80 [percent],” said Myers to CoinDesk. “So, it’s low but it’s positive compared to the last time it was not positive.”  Validators under a different reward issuance schedule proposed as recently as two weeks ago would have only turned over a profit if they were the first 300,000 or so in the network to stake their tokens. This is because ethereum 2.0's code would attempt to dynamically incentivize the number of people staking their ether and taper reward issuance as more ether is staked.  Now, under the new issuance schedule, the first one million validators will turn over a profit on their investment. This, according to director of Consensys Capital Tanner Hoban, is a significant improvement to the anticipated design of ethereum 2.0. “I think it provides stronger security for the network and I think it enables more confidence in the network,” said Hoban to CoinDesk.  Founder of ethereum information site ETHHub Eric Conner told CoinDesk:  “I think we’ve hit that sweet spot between security and making sure we hold on to ether being a store of value and being programmable money and not over-issuing.”  Favoring ‘true decentralization’  It’s important to note that the above estimates of the ethereum 2.0 reward issuance schedule are for a single validator run on independently owned computer devices. One user can actually run multiple computers as validators on the new ethereum network each with a minimum stake of 32 ETH.  Myers notes that users may also choose to stake their wealth and run validators using cloud service providers as opposed to running their own hardware and bypass any costs associated with machinery upkeep.  “Let’s say you’re a digital nomad and you want to stake 32 ETH on your own,” explained Myers. So, through your laptop you would get an Amazon Web Services account and then you would host your ETH through them as your cloud provider instead of using your own machine.”  Doing this is less costly for a user upfront and decidedly more mobile. However, Myers in his calculations found that over a year’s time with cloud service costs being at least $80 per month (if not more), a user validating blocks and transactions on the ethereum 2.0 network would make an annual profit of -$783 and a net yield of -15.30 percent.  It’s a “massive difference” to running validation on your own hardware versus cloud services, said Myers. “But I actually think it makes sense.”  Myers told CoinDesk:  “You want to be promoting people to do it in their own home. What that says is this model favors true decentralization which is a human being running machines in their own home instead of relying on someone else to do it for them.”  And even if profit is a net negative, Myers argues that some validators on the ethereum 2.0 network will still stake for two reasons. First, “because they believe in a decentralized future even if it’s unprofitable for them. They anticipate making it into a reality.”  “Answer number two are those who believe in ethereum just as much but are a little bit more rational,” explained Myers. “They’ll say, ‘Look, I believe in ethereum. I believe in the long-term potential for it...I do believe the token will increase substantially in value in the future. So I’m okay with losing [money] to accumulate X amount of tokens.”  ‘Trending’ in the right direction  Overall, Eric Conner from ETHHub expects that with ethereum 2.0 blockchain security will be much cheaper to secure than is currently the case.  “We're creating like 4.8 million ether a year to pay miners so it’s a lot higher security budget but proof-of-stake introduces a new paradigm there,” said Conner to CoinDesk. In comparison, the ethereum 2.0 protocol would issue just under 100,000 ETH annually, assuming 30 million ETH were staked on the network  Conner explained:  “The reason for that is there’s different styles of attack...There’s very different attack vectors in proof-of-stake. One of the major benefits of ethereum 2.0 proof-of-stake is that if there’s a bad actor, their [staked] ether can be slashed. So people obviously don’t want to burn any amount of value.”  Conner suspects that with the “sweet spot” between network security and validator profitability having been met with the new reward issuance schedule, ethereum researchers and developers will begin focusing on state transitions.  “The still open discussions that are out there that aren't finalized are outside issuance like how the state is going to be transitioned from ethereum 1.0 to 2.0,” said Conner. “There’s been some discussions around trying to migrate ether from the 1.0 to 2.0 chain like in Phase Zero, is it going to be a one-way or two-way bridge?”  Phase Zero is the first phase of ethereum 2.0 rollout where a new proof-of-stake blockchain known as the “beacon chain” will be launched. The code for Phase Zero which includes the new reward issuance plan, scheduled to be finalized by June 30, and in Conner’s best estimations, activated on mainnet sometime in Q1 of 2020.  To this, Anthony Sassano also working on ETHHub with Conner added during an ethereum community call Wednesday that in his view lingering questions over reward issuance schedule on ethereum 2.0 simply won't find answers until the beacon chain goes live.  ""I think we're going to have a very diverse set of people that will be staking and that's why the rewards are variable as well,"" said Sassano during the call. ""We might only get five million staked [on the network] at the start, maybe we get ten million...but I don't think we're going to have answers to this until the chain actually goes live and not just live but also some kind economic activity happening on ethereum 2.0.""  Ultimately both Conner and Myers expressed their satisfaction that the plan, while not finalized, has been ""done in a decentralized manner,"" in the spirit of the project as a whole.  Myers concluded:  ""I have enjoyed the increased focus on economics versus security and how we find that equilibrium. Overall, we are trending in the correct direction on all elements of the ethereum ecosystem.""

42381838,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9pvCp,1557290743,Binance Considered Pushing for Bitcoin 'Rollback' Following $40 Million Hack,"UPDATE: After this article was published, Changpeng Zhao, CEO of Binance, said in a follow-up tweet that after speaking with various parties, the exchange decided not to pursue the rollback approach.      In the wake of a multimillion-dollar hack Tuesday, Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of cryptocurrency exchange startup Binance publicly discussed whether the company might seek to encourage bitcoin miners and node operators to ""rollback"" the bitcoin blockchain, reversing transactions confirmed by the network to return the funds.  The comments were made as Zhao hosted an Ask-Me-Anything session at 3:00 UTC on Wednesday to address various questions about the hack, which saw assailant steal some 7,000 bitcoin from the exchange.  Answering questions on whether the firm would consider attempting to convince network stakeholders to roll back bitcoin network transactions, which would require pushing for consensus from major miners and mining pools to gather over 51 percent of the network's total hashing power, Zhao said:  ""To be honest, we can actually do this probably within the next few days. But there are concerns that if we do a rollback on the bitcoin network at that scale, it may have some negative consequences, in terms of destroying the credibility for bitcoin.""  The unprecedented step – which would have found a private business appealing to the distributed network of individuals who contribute to the operation of the cryptocurrency – was met with heavy criticism.  To try and roll back the network without an agreement between the entire industry and community would most likely be seen by many as effectively an attack on the bitcoin network, which is intended to be immutable.  However, the idea is not without context, as it has been brought up in the wake of exchange hacks in years past, and, on at least one smaller blockchain network, actually executed. Further, the conversation was initiated in part by Jeremy Rubin, a developer who has in the past contributed to bitcoin's open-source code.  (Note: To be clear, that does not imply Rubin should be seen as an authority figure in this situation, as node operators and miners would have to reverse any transactions. However, his association with the project appears to have contributed to Zhao's impression this was suggested by the network's developers.)  Indeed, Zhao noted the possible backlash against the idea, adding that he has also seen a lot of people objecting to rollbacks since there are the ""ethical and reputational considerations for the bitcoin network.""  ""The team is still deciding that, and we are running through the numbers and checking everything,"" he said. ""It's interesting that it's a tech solution [suggested] to us by the community, including some of the core members of the bitcoin development team. We will consider that very, very carefully, with the feedback we are receiving.""  Zhao added the company is now focusing on rebuilding and recovering its exchange system and has hence suspended all withdrawals and deposits, which he said is estimated to ""take about a week"" to resume.  So far, Binance has not found any other of its hot wallet addresses that are compromised. Zhao said the hackers used sophisticated methods to gain access to users' accounts and orchestrated the hack patiently, in the sense that ""they don't move as soon as they have one account but have waited until they have a large number of high net worth accounts.""  Elsewhere in his session, Zhao said Binance has enough resources from its Secure Asset Fund for Users (SAFU fund) for recovering the loss of $40 million for users, though ""it does hurt very much.""  Binance started allocating 10 percent of its trading fees every month since July last year to the SAFU fund. The firm hasn't responded to a CoinDesk inquiry regarding how much exactly the fund has.  Based on the amount of the Binance BNB tokens burnt using 20 percent of its quarterly profits, Binance generated about $210 million in profits from July last year to March.  Editor's note: This article has been updated to clarify how decision-making works on the bitcoin network and to make clear Binance cannot unilaterally reverse transactions on the bitcoin blockchain.
