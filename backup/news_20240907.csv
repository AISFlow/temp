33313001,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640420,1725741000,"Here’s Why Bitcoin Price Crashed Below $54,000","The Bitcoin price dropped below $54,000 on September 6 as the flagship crypto experienced a massive wave of sell-offs from traders. This price decline was sparked by developments on the macroeconomic side, which painted a bearish outlook for Bitcoin. Related Reading: Cardano Bull Sees ADA Jumping 1,000% In An ‘Insane’ Rally Bitcoin Slides Following Weak Job Report Bitcoin’s price retreated following a weak August job report. Data from the US Bureau of Labor showed that the unemployment rate fell to 4.2% while the labor market added 142,000 nonfarm payroll jobs. While the unemployment rate was in line with expectations, the job additions were lower than the expected 164,000, initially estimated by market experts. This further casts doubt on Bitcoin’s trajectory, considering how fragile the US economy looks at the moment. This poses a threat to risk assets like the flagship crypto. The bearish outlook for Bitcoin was further heightened by the revisions to the July and June job reports, which showed that the US added fewer jobs than was initially reported in those months. Earlier, Bitcoin had already had an unpleasant start to September, which is historically very bearish for the leading crypto. NewsBTC reported that Bitcoin had suffered a price crash earlier in the week due to the markets still feeling the effects of the Yen carry trade and following significant volatility in the US stock market, with over $1.05 million being wiped out on September 3. Macroeconomic factors remain primarily responsible for Bitcoin’s recent bearish price action and the broader crypto market, especially with a rate cut from the US Federal Reserve still in the balance. It is worth mentioning that the July job reports (the lowest job additions over the last two years) and the Yen carry trade were responsible for the August 5 market crash, which caused Bitcoin to drop below $50,000. Interestingly, Arthur Hayes, the co-founder of the BitMEX crypto exchange, stated that he expects Bitcoin to drop below $50,000 this weekend, revealing that he had opened a short position. A Rate Cut Looking More Unlikely For a while now, the crypto market has been anticipating that the Fed will cut interest rates at its next FOMC meeting, which will be held between September 17 and 18. Bernstein analysts predicted that this move would provide some form of bullish momentum for Bitcoin’s price. However, a rate cut, especially by 50 basis points (bps), is now unlikely following the release of the job data. Crypto commentator The Kobeissi Letter highlighted in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the odds for a 50bps have dropped to 23% on the prediction markets. The Fed might no longer be in a hurry to cut rates since the situation in the labor market isn’t as bad as it was initially feared following the release of the July jobs report. Related Reading: Aptos (APT) Dips 15% As New Innovations Fail To Spark Momentum Whatever happens, crypto analysts like CryptoCon are confident that the worst is almost over for Bitcoin.

33308916,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640421,1725733816,PEPE Faces Key Support Test At $0.00000589 – Will Bulls Hold The Line?,"PEPE is facing intense bearish pressure, with its price trending downward toward a critical support level at $0.00000589. Recent market actions have shown that the bears are firmly in control, pushing the token closer to this key threshold. As sellers continue to dominate, the question is whether the bulls can step in to defend this level or if PEPE is set for further declines. This article will analyze PEPE’s recent price action as it nears the critical support level at $0.00000589 by examining key technical indicators and market dynamics. It will explore whether the bulls can mount a defense to prevent further losses or if the bears will drive the token lower, aiming to provide a potential future outlook for the cryptocurrency. With a market capitalization exceeding $2.8 billion and a trading volume surpassing $602 million, PEPE was trading at approximately $0.000006683, reflecting a 6.47% decrease at the time of writing. In the past 24 hours, its market cap has dropped by 6,47%, while trading volume has increased by 74.80%. Current Market Sentiment: Bearish Signals Dominate On the 4-hour chart, although PEPE is attempting to move upward, it has maintained its downward trajectory after successfully breaking below the $0.00000766 level, continuing to trade below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). The asset is moving closer to the $0.00000589 support level, with negative market sentiment persisting. Also, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the 4-hour chart is currently at 31%, indicating that PEPE is in the oversold zone. This level suggests that selling pressure has been strong, potentially hinting at a short-term rebound or consolidation if the bears do not maintain dominance. On the daily chart, PEPE has shown significant bearish momentum since breaking below the $0.00000766 level and trading under the 100-day SMA. While the cryptocurrency is currently attempting an upward move, this rebound could be short-lived due to the prevailing bearish sentiment, which continues to exert pressure on the price. Finally, the RSI signal line on the 1-day chart is currently sitting at 36% as it continues to trend below the 50% threshold, suggesting that PEPE remains under bearish pressure, with the potential for bears to regain control and push the price lower. What’s Next For PEPE: Outlook For The Coming Days The current bearish trend, marked by negative momentum indicators, suggests that the bears could drive the price of PEPE to the $0.00000589 support level. If this support is broken, it could trigger further bearish action, potentially pushing the asset down to the $0.00000398 support level and possibly lower. However, if PEPE bounces back at the $0.00000589 support, it could retrace towards the resistance level at $0.00000766. Should the crypto asset break above this level, it could signal a further upward movement, possibly targeting the $0.00001152 resistance range and other higher levels.

33304982,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640371,1725726601,Bitcoin Flashes On-Chain Signal That Triggered A 175% Rally The Last Time,"A crypto analyst has revealed that the price of Bitcoin might be gearing for a fresh rally after the appearance of a bullish on-chain signal. Bitcoin UTXOs In Profit At Lowest Level Since 2023 — Here’s Why In a QuickTake post on the CryptoQuant platform, an analyst with the pseudonym EgyHash shared an interesting on-chain insight into the Bitcoin price. This on-chain observation revolves around the Bitcoin UTXO (unspent transaction output) metric, which tracks the amount of cryptocurrency that remains following the execution of a transaction. Related Reading: Here’s How Cardano Price Will ‘Survive’ A US Recession: Crypto Analyst The percentage of these unspent cryptocurrencies in profit gives an insight into the market’s current condition. For instance, an increase in Bitcoin UTXOs in profit suggests that most investors are in the green, which can either motivate them to keep faith in the coin or, in some scenarios, push them to take profit. On the other hand, when a higher percentage of UTXOs are in loss, it means that more investors are holding a loss, suggesting a negative market sentiment. According to the CryptoQuant analyst, the percentage of Bitcoin UTXOs in profit has steadily declined, recently falling to its lowest level since October 2023. Data from CryptoQuant shows that the proportion of Bitcoin UTXOs in profit decreased from 99% in June 2024 to 68.5% in September 2024. Interestingly, this market phenomenon has coincided with a recent fall in the price of Bitcoin. The crypto analyst noted that the decline in Bitcoin’s price seems to be associated with profit-taking, as investors are selling their coins to realize some gain. Meanwhile, this is supported by the aforementioned decline in the percentage of Bitcoin UTXOs in profit. Nevertheless, it may not be all bad news for the premier cryptocurrency with the UTXO metric currently at a multi-month low. Historical data shows that the proportion of BTC UTXOs in profit being at its current level could be a signal of a market bottom. The last time the Bitcoin UTXOs in profit slumped to 68.5%, the price of Bitcoin rallied 175% from $26,700 to a new all-time high of $73,737. While there is no guarantee there will be a repeat rally from the current point, investors might still want to pay attention to other relevant on-chain metrics. BTC Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of Bitcoin is slightly under the $54,000 level, reflecting a 4.1% decline in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the flagship cryptocurrency is down by more than 9% in the past week. Related Reading: Solana To $100 Inevitable After This Break?

33304825,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640532,1725726356,Washington DC Serial Entrepreneur Who Bought PEPE at Inception Has Now Bought This Casino Coin Priced $0.0021,"A Washington DC-based serial entrepreneur who was fortunate enough to buy PEPE at its inception has now shifted focus to a new rising star in the meme coin space: Mpeppe (MPEPE), a casino-themed meme coin currently priced at $0.0021. Let’s explore why this entrepreneur, who has a history of making big gains with PEPE, has turned to Mpeppe, and how this token is poised for a breakout. The Rise and Stumble of PEPE Pepe Coin (PEPE) made a splash in the meme coin world earlier in the year, peaking with a market cap exceeding $7 billion. Investors flocked to the token as it rapidly gained value, driven by community enthusiasm and market hype. However, like many meme coins, Pepe Coin (PEPE) couldn’t sustain its momentum for long. After hitting its peak in May 2024, the token has been on a steady decline, losing over 58% of its value. Currently, Pepe Coin (PEPE) is trading 7% lower this week, bringing its market cap below $3 billion. The overall bearish market conditions have certainly played a role in PEPE’s decline, but some analysts believe that its potential for a rebound still exists, particularly as “Uptober” approaches—a period historically known for market recoveries. However, the entrepreneurial mind is always looking for the next opportunity, and this is where Mpeppe (MPEPE) enters the scene. Mpeppe (MPEPE) Steals the Spotlight As Pepe Coin (PEPE) struggles to regain its previous highs, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is emerging as a new force in the meme coin arena. Built around a casino and online entertainment concept, Mpeppe is drawing attention not just for its fun and humorous appeal, but also for its robust ecosystem, which is designed to engage users through gamification and rewards. The entrepreneur who profited from Pepe Coin (PEPE) early success has now invested in Mpeppe (MPEPE), recognizing its potential as the next big meme coin to watch. Currently priced at $0.0021, Mpeppe is in the midst of its presale and has already raised an impressive $1.8 million, with over 97% of its tokens sold. This overwhelming interest from investors and the community suggests that Mpeppe is poised for significant gains once it officially launches. Why Mpeppe is Attracting High-Profile Investors One of the key reasons Mpeppe (MPEPE) is garnering attention from high-profile investors, including this Washington DC entrepreneur, is its casino-themed platform. Unlike many meme coins that lack real-world utility, Mpeppe has created a decentralized casino ecosystem that allows users to earn rewards while participating in various gaming activities. This integration of entertainment and financial opportunity is a compelling proposition for investors looking for more than just speculative gains. The casino aspect also taps into a massive and lucrative market. Online casinos and gaming platforms are booming, and Mpeppe’s ability to combine this industry with the viral nature of meme coins gives it a unique edge over other tokens like Pepe Coin (PEPE). Investors see this as an opportunity not just for short-term gains, but for sustained growth driven by real use cases and community engagement. The Future of Mpeppe: What Investors Can Expect As Mpeppe (MPEPE) presale nears completion, excitement is building within the crypto community. The token has already experienced a 150% rally, and many believe that this is just the beginning. The platform’s roadmap includes plans for listing on Tier-1 exchanges, which could further drive demand and increase the token’s price in the coming months. For the Washington DC entrepreneur who made a fortune with Pepe Coin (PEPE), Mpeppe represents a new frontier in the meme coin space. By investing early, he’s betting on the token’s ability to replicate or even surpass PEPE’s success. With a strong community, a unique value proposition, and a rapidly growing ecosystem, Mpeppe is shaping up to be a formidable contender in the world of meme coins. Conclusion: A Strategic Move for Meme Coin Enthusiasts The shift from Pepe Coin (PEPE) to Mpeppe (MPEPE) by this seasoned entrepreneur highlights the growing belief that Mpeppe could be the next big winner in the meme coin market. As Pepe Coin (PEPE) continues to experience volatility and struggle with price stability, Mpeppe offers a fresh opportunity for investors looking to capitalize on the next wave of meme coin mania.

Investors who once celebrated Solana’s scalability and speed now find themselves concerned about the future of the coin as its price continues to face challenges. At the same time, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is gaining significant attention with its upcoming listing on tier-1 exchanges, sparking debate about whether it could reach the elusive $1 mark. Solana’s Volatility and Struggles to Hit $140 As of early September 2024, Solana (SOL) is grappling with intense market fluctuations. Once regarded as a key player in the blockchain space due to its fast transaction speeds and scalability, Solana is now encountering headwinds that are making it difficult for the token to maintain steady upward momentum. Despite attempts to rally, Solana (SOL) has not yet hit the $140 mark, which has led to a decline in investor confidence. Solana (SOL) price has been fluctuating, making it hard to predict whether the coin can sustain its long-term growth potential. With the broader market continuing to experience turbulence, some investors are questioning whether Solana (SOL) can break past its current resistance levels and make a move toward $150. While the potential is there, the ongoing volatility has many traders seeking out alternative opportunities that offer more immediate returns. Solana’s Market Chaos and Its Ripple Effects The market volatility surrounding Solana (SOL) has not gone unnoticed. Investors are observing significant sell-offs as the token faces downward pressure. This has eroded confidence in Solana’s short-term prospects, with some analysts predicting that the token could struggle to even maintain its current support levels. Many are beginning to question whether Solana can regain its previous highs, with the $140 mark proving to be a major hurdle. Despite these struggles, some analysts believe Solana still has a chance to rebound if the broader crypto market experiences a recovery. However, in the current climate, investors are increasingly looking elsewhere for opportunities, especially as Solana battles the harsh realities of a fluctuating market. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The Meme Coin Poised for Success While Solana (SOL) faces challenges, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is rapidly gaining traction in the meme coin sector. With its unique casino-based platform and deflationary tokenomics, Mpeppe has become one of the most talked-about meme coins in 2024. As Solana struggles to reach the $140 mark, Mpeppe’s presale has raised over $1.8 million, with over 66% of the tokens already sold. The coin’s price has surged by 150%, attracting both retail and institutional investors. The upcoming tier-1 exchange listing for Mpeppe has sparked a debate about whether the coin could eventually reach $1, a milestone that seems within reach given the current momentum. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s strong community support, combined with its innovative platform and real-world applications, sets it apart from other meme coins that rely purely on hype. Solana’s Uncertain Future vs. Mpeppe’s Rising Dominance For investors looking to balance their portfolios, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers an appealing alternative to Solana (SOL). While Solana’s technology and past success cannot be ignored, the token’s current struggles have left many questioning its near-term prospects. The inability to hit $140 has raised concerns about its long-term viability, especially as the market experiences intense volatility. In contrast, Mpeppe (MPEPE)‘s presale success and tier-1 listing have created significant buzz, positioning it as one of the most promising meme coins of the year. With its casino-based platform and deflationary mechanism, Mpeppe is expected to continue its upward trajectory, making it an attractive option for investors seeking substantial returns in a market that has been otherwise unpredictable. Conclusion: Solana’s Struggles and Mpeppe’s Path to Success As Solana (SOL) continues to face challenges, its journey toward $140 remains uncertain. Market volatility has weighed heavily on the token, causing many investors to explore alternatives. Mpeppe (MPEPE), with its strong presale performance and upcoming exchange listings, has emerged as a dominant player in the meme coin space, offering significant potential for growth. As investors debate the future of Solana and speculate on Mpeppe’s $1 dream, the next few months will be critical in determining the trajectory of both these assets.

33304490,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640528,1725725672,"Top Analyst Data Suggest Massive Buy Signals For Mpeppe and Solana (SOL), Here’s Why","The current market landscape for cryptocurrencies has been filled with volatility, and while larger assets like Solana (SOL) and Ethereum struggle to maintain momentum, there are signals of opportunities in projects like Mpeppe (MPEPE). With Solana facing challenges amid a broader bearish sentiment, investors are keeping a close eye on newer tokens like Mpeppe, which has demonstrated significant potential with strong presale results and growing community support. Solana’s Struggles Amid Market Volatility Solana (SOL), one of the prominent players in the crypto space, has recently faced substantial setbacks. The token’s price has experienced a downturn, reflecting the broader market’s turbulence. As of early September 2024, Solana is battling to reclaim the $140 price mark, a critical resistance point that has eluded it for weeks. Crypto analysts like Mikybull Crypto have noted that the current bearish trend may be the final phase before a larger market reversal. The struggles of the Nikkei 225 index in Japan have contributed to the liquidation of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) positions, as many investors close their carry trades based on the low interest rates in Japan. As a result, Solana has been caught in the crossfire of these broader macroeconomic trends, causing significant price fluctuations. Despite these challenges, analysts remain cautiously optimistic that a bull run could be on the horizon for Solana (SOL) and other altcoins. If this market turnaround materializes, Solana may be one of the first to experience a substantial price rally, potentially pushing its value well above $140. However, until that time, the token’s volatility continues to be a source of concern for investors. The Rise of Mpeppe (MPEPE): A New Market Favorite As Solana (SOL) struggles to regain its footing, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has emerged as a strong contender in the meme coin space. Currently in its presale stage, Mpeppe has raised over $1.9 million, with more than 66% of its tokens already sold. The meme coin has gained widespread attention for its innovative casino-based ecosystem, which includes staking and other gamified features. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s unique appeal lies in its ability to combine the fun and community-driven aspects of meme coins with real-world utility. Unlike many other meme coins that rely solely on speculation, Mpeppe offers its users tangible benefits, including the ability to earn passive income through staking and participation in its platform. The upcoming listing of Mpeppe on tier-1 exchanges has further fueled speculation that the coin could experience massive gains. Analysts are pointing to a potential rally as Mpeppe continues to build momentum, with some even suggesting that the token could reach the $1 mark in the near future. This optimism has attracted both retail and institutional investors, many of whom are looking for alternatives to more volatile assets like Solana. Data Signals a Buying Opportunity for Both Solana and Mpeppe According to market data, both Solana (SOL) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are showing promising buy signals. Solana, despite its current struggles, is still considered a strong long-term investment due to its robust blockchain technology and strong developer ecosystem. As the broader market begins to stabilize, many analysts believe that Solana could see a resurgence in price, especially if it breaks through the $140 resistance level. Mpeppe (MPEPE), on the other hand, has become the focus of attention due to its impressive presale performance and the potential for significant upside. The meme coin’s unique ecosystem, combined with its upcoming tier-1 exchange listing, has positioned it as a top contender for investors looking to capitalize on the next big opportunity in the crypto space. Conclusion: A Balanced Approach For investors looking to balance their portfolios, both Solana (SOL) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) offer intriguing opportunities. Solana’s current price struggles may present a buying opportunity for those willing to wait for a market recovery, while Mpeppe (MPEPE) strong presale results and unique features make it an attractive option for more immediate returns. As the market continues to evolve, data suggests that now may be an opportune time to consider both assets. Whether Solana can break through its current resistance or Mpeppe reaches its much-anticipated $1 target, the coming months will be critical for both tokens.

33304380,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640525,1725725512,Toncoin (TON) Price Prediction: Market Experts Dive Into TON & Mpeppe As Both Gain Supporter Momentum,"As Toncoin (TON) continues its climb, surging 7% in the last 24 hours to reach $5.13, the token is attracting renewed interest from traders and investors alike. This price boost follows remarks made by Telegram CEO Pavel Durov, who recently spoke out against his arrest by French authorities, calling it a “misguided approach.” The news has stirred up positive sentiment for Toncoin (TON), driving its price and trading volume higher. Meanwhile, investors are also increasingly looking toward promising new projects like Mpeppe (MPEPE), a casino-themed meme coin, as it builds momentum in the presale phase. With Toncoin (TON) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) both gathering steam, analysts are taking a closer look at their potential trajectories Toncoin (TON)’s Recent Price Surge and Future Outlook The price of Toncoin (TON) has been volatile, with the coin trading in a falling wedge pattern that has kept it under bearish pressure for several weeks. Despite this, Toncoin (TON) recently found support at $4.50, providing the foundation for a bullish reversal. The price surge to $5.13 came amid increased trading volume, rising 14% to reach $521 million. Technical indicators suggest that this upward trend could continue. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has rebounded from below the neutral zone, currently sitting at 44 and climbing. This indicates growing buying pressure for Toncoin (TON). Furthermore, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is moving towards a bullish crossover, signaling that momentum is shifting in favor of the bulls. If this bullish momentum continues, Toncoin (TON) could break out of its falling wedge pattern and aim for a price target of $7.00. However, if the bears regain control, Toncoin (TON) could dip back to its previous support level of $4.30, making it a critical time for investors to monitor the market. Mpeppe (MPEPE) Gaining Momentum Alongside Toncoin (TON) While Toncoin (TON) is regaining ground, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is also capturing attention for its unique value proposition in the meme coin market. Mpeppe (MPEPE), a casino-focused cryptocurrency, has seen a significant uptick in presale activity as it nears its official launch. The token is positioned to capitalize on the growing interest in decentralized gambling platforms, with its use case revolving around a fair, transparent, and fast online casino experience. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s presale is generating buzz due to its low entry price, which offers high growth potential, much like Toncoin (TON) did in its early stages. Early investors are excited about the token’s unique utility within the gambling space, where users can participate in casino games such as poker, roulette, and slots, all powered by blockchain technology. As Mpeppe (MPEPE) nears its launch, market experts are drawing parallels between the token and other meme coins like PEPE and DOGE, which saw exponential growth after their launch. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s entry into the casino and gambling sector also positions it as a key player in the fast-growing GambleFi market, making it a strong contender for investors looking to diversify from traditional cryptos like Toncoin (TON). Toncoin (TON) and Mpeppe (MPEPE): A Potential Power Duo? Both Toncoin (TON) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are at pivotal moments in their respective journeys. While Toncoin (TON) has already established itself as a top altcoin, it is now aiming for a price rebound after recent market setbacks. Mpeppe (MPEPE), on the other hand, is a new player, but its appeal lies in its niche focus on the decentralized casino sector, where there is ample room for growth. With Toncoin (TON) trading above its 20-day moving averages and showing signs of a bullish breakout, many investors see it as a safe bet for the next few months. On the flip side, Mpeppe (MPEPE) presents a high-reward opportunity, with the potential to deliver significant gains, particularly for those who get in early. Both tokens are garnering attention from the crypto community, and market experts believe that they could perform exceptionally well in the final quarter of 2024. If Toncoin (TON) breaks through its $7.00 resistance and Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s presale gains continue, investors could see considerable returns from both tokens. Conclusion: Toncoin (TON) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) in Focus For investors looking to diversify, both Toncoin (TON) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) offer compelling opportunities. Toncoin (TON) provides the stability of an established token with promising technical indicators, while Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a high-reward play with strong presale momentum. As both tokens gain traction, they could very well become two of the standout performers in the crypto space by the end of 2024.

33302920,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640520,1725722869,SUI Investors Shift Their Focus To New Cryptocurrency Due To 150% Gains and New Announcement,"As the broader cryptocurrency market continues to fluctuate, Sui (SUI) investors are seeking new opportunities to diversify their portfolios. While SUI has shown impressive growth recently, a new player in the crypto space, Mpeppe (MPEPE), has caught the attention of these investors, primarily due to its 150% presale gains and recent announcements that have energized its community. Mpeppe, a meme coin with substantial potential, is quickly becoming a popular choice for Sui investors who are looking to capitalize on short-term gains and promising future developments. Sui’s Growth Doesn’t Help Strong Price Action Sui (SUI) has been one of the standout altcoins in recent months, gaining significant traction with its innovative consensus engine, Mysticeti. This engine aims to make Sui’s blockchain faster and more scalable, which has led to a surge in its total value locked (TVL) within the ecosystem. In August alone, Sui saw a significant increase in locked tokens, boosting overall interest in the project. However, despite the impressive growth, Sui’s price action is showing signs of weakening, with analysts warning that the rising wedge pattern on its chart may lead to a downward correction. Should Sui break below key support levels, it could fall to $0.45, a scenario that has prompted some investors to hedge their bets with casino crypto Mpeppe. Here’s Why SUI Investors Are Turning to Mpeppe (MPEPE) As Sui’s momentum starts to slow, investors are increasingly shifting their focus to Mpeppe (MPEPE), a rapidly growing meme coin that has already garnered significant attention due to its presale performance. Mpeppe is currently priced at $0.0021, and its presale has raised over $1.9 million, with more than 66% of Stage 4 tokens already sold. This meteoric rise has not gone unnoticed by Sui investors, who are looking to capture similar gains in a more speculative and high-reward market. Mpeppe’s unique appeal lies in its community-driven approach and the potential for massive returns, much like other successful meme coins such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. For Sui investors who have seen impressive returns from their initial investments in Sui, Mpeppe offers an opportunity to diversify into a different market sector while maintaining the possibility of high returns. The shift in focus is not just about short-term gains; it’s about participating in a project with strong community backing and viral potential. Mpeppe’s Presale Success and Growth Capabilities One of the major reasons Mpeppe has attracted attention is its impressive presale success. In a short amount of time, the project has raised nearly $2 million, with Stage 4 of the presale 66% completed. This rapid pace of token sales suggests that there is significant interest in the project, both from retail investors and, increasingly, institutional players. The current price of Mpeppe stands at $0.0021, but as the presale stages progress, this price is expected to rise, offering early investors the chance to realize substantial returns once the coin officially launches. The buzz surrounding Mpeppe’s presale, combined with its community-driven nature, makes it an attractive prospect for those who believe in the long-term success of meme coins in the crypto market. What’s Next for Sui and Mpeppe Despite its recent gains, Sui’s future remains uncertain, especially if its price continues to fall. While the introduction of the Mysticeti consensus engine has provided a boost, the overall market conditions and the technical analysis of Sui’s chart suggest that a price correction may be imminent. For many investors, this potential downturn is a signal to explore other opportunities, leading them to projects like Mpeppe (MPEPE). Mpeppe, on the other hand, is riding a wave of momentum, fueled by strong community support and the promise of high returns. As more investors, including those from Sui, flock to the project, Mpeppe is poised for even greater success. The meme coin market, while inherently speculative, has shown time and again that it has the potential to deliver massive gains to early adopters, and Mpeppe appears to be no exception. Sui to Mpeppe – A Strategic Shift from Utility to Meme As Sui investors look to the future, many are hedging their bets by investing in Mpeppe, a fast-growing meme coin with substantial presale success. While Sui has made significant strides with its new consensus engine, the potential for a price correction has led some investors to explore alternative opportunities. Mpeppe (MPEPE), with its strong presale performance and viral appeal, offers a promising avenue for those looking to capitalize on the next big meme coin. For those who got in early on Sui and reaped the rewards of its recent surge, Mpeppe provides a fresh opportunity to diversify and continue their crypto journey. As both projects evolve, it will be interesting to see how Mpeppe’s presale success translates into long-term gains for its investors and how Sui navigates its current market challenges.

33302868,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640518,1725722718,Why Are Institutional Traders Keeping Eye On XRP and This Fast Growing Meme Coin Priced at $0.0021,"Institutional investors are becoming more cautious yet opportunistic as they navigate the crypto markets, with Ripple’s XRP and a fast-growing meme coin, Mpeppe (MPEPE), catching their attention. While XRP has faced turbulence in recent months, Mpeppe has been building momentum in its presale stages. The significant interest in both assets shows that institutional players are still on the hunt for the next big opportunity, despite overall market uncertainty. Ripple Price Analysis: Recent UpHill Battles Ripple’s XRP has had a tumultuous few weeks. In August 2024, XRP reached a peak of $0.65 before a downward spiral set in, driven by bearish market sentiment. As of September 6, XRP is struggling to maintain support at $0.54, and analysts are bracing for further declines. XRP’s macro outlook remains somewhat positive due to its utility in cross-border payments and ongoing developments in Ripple Labs. However, the current trend is bearish, with traders eyeing a potential drop to lower support levels around $0.489 or even August’s low of $0.432. A critical resistance level to watch on the upside sits at $0.585, and should the bulls take charge, XRP could aim to reclaim $0.64 or even $0.70. Despite these challenges, institutional interest in XRP remains strong. Large-scale investors see potential in Ripple’s long-term roadmap, especially if regulatory clarity is achieved regarding its legal battles with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Institutions are holding their breath, waiting for XRP to break out of its current bearish cycle and capitalize on any bullish reversal. Some traders are hedging their position against XRP with Mpeppe (MPEPE) after rallying 150% and showing an uplift north of 13,000%. Mpeppe (MPEPE): Breaking Records While XRP struggles with price volatility, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is carving out its own space as a rising meme coin star, catching the eyes of institutional traders seeking high-risk, high-reward investments. Currently priced at $0.0021, Mpeppe has already raised over $1.9 million in its presale and has sold more than 1.5 billion tokens, with 66% of Stage 4 already completed. Mpeppe has attracted a strong community following, and its presale success reflects growing confidence in the coin’s potential to deliver massive returns. Meme coins like Mpeppe have a unique appeal, offering investors the chance to get in early on a project that can skyrocket in value once it hits the broader market. The viral nature of meme coins makes them a speculative favorite, especially during periods of market stagnation. Why Institutional Traders Are So Interested in Mpeppe Institutional traders, known for their traditionally conservative approaches, are paying attention to Mpeppe for several reasons. First, the success of meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu in past cycles has shown that these assets can generate significant returns in short periods. Mpeppe, with its strong presale momentum, offers a chance to replicate that success. Second, Mpeppe has built a solid foundation with its early presale stages, raising nearly $2 million so far. Institutional traders often look for projects with strong community backing and early traction, as these are indicators of potential market success. Mpeppe’s growing community engagement and robust social media presence further bolster its appeal as a meme coin to watch. Finally, the relatively low price point of $0.0021 per Mpeppe token provides an attractive entry opportunity for institutional investors. As institutional players seek diversification in their portfolios, adding a promising meme coin like Mpeppe could offer them the potential for outsized returns without the need for a significant capital outlay. The Market Landscape: XRP and Mpeppe on Institutional Radar Both XRP and Mpeppe represent intriguing, albeit different, opportunities for institutional traders. XRP is well-established, with strong use cases in cross-border payments and liquidity management. Its institutional appeal lies in its utility and the potential for regulatory clarity that could propel the token’s value higher. On the other hand, Mpeppe is a speculative play with immense growth potential in a short amount of time. Meme coins, with their viral appeal and ability to generate quick profits, provide an alternative path for institutional investors looking to capitalize on market trends outside of traditional utility-based assets like XRP. Navigating the Risk-Reward Trade-Off For institutional investors, the decision to allocate funds to Ripple (XRP) or Mpeppe (MPEPE) comes down to balancing risk and reward. XRP offers long-term utility and is positioned to benefit from regulatory developments, while Mpeppe provides an opportunity to ride the wave of meme coin success in a market that thrives on community engagement and viral growth. As the cryptocurrency market evolves, both assets are likely to continue drawing institutional interest for different reasons. XRP’s potential for recovery and Mpeppe’s explosive presale success demonstrate that, even in times of market uncertainty, there are always opportunities for savvy investors willing to take calculated risks.

While Floki Inu (FLOKI) has taken a sharp dip, dropping 22.1%, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is soaring high, completing 97% of its Stage 3 presale. This divergence has captured the interest of investors and enthusiasts alike, marking a pivotal moment for both tokens. Let’s explore what’s driving these changes and why Mpeppe (MPEPE) is attracting so much attention. Floki Inu (FLOKI) Faces a 22.1% Drop in September Floki Inu (FLOKI), one of the most popular memecoins of recent years, has seen its price drop by 22.1% in September. While Floki Inu (FLOKI) has had its share of ups and downs, this decline comes as a surprise to many who had anticipated a stronger performance in Q3. The community-driven token, which gained popularity through viral marketing and celebrity endorsements, seems to be struggling to maintain its momentum. The drop in price could be attributed to increased competition in the memecoin space, with new contenders like Mpeppe (MPEPE) emerging and capturing the attention of investors. Floki Inu (FLOKI)’s dip is causing some investors to reconsider their holdings as they search for alternative projects with more promising returns. Mpeppe (MPEPE) Surges Ahead, Completing 97% of Stage 3 Presale While Floki Inu (FLOKI) struggles, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is experiencing a surge of its own. With 97% of its Stage 3 presale completed, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about tokens in the market. The project, inspired by Pepecoin and the iconic soccer player Kylian Mbappé, is bringing a unique blend of sports fandom and crypto innovation to the forefront. Mpeppe (MPEPE) is not just riding the wave of memecoins—it’s creating a robust ecosystem that combines gaming, sports betting, and community engagement. With its innovative use of blockchain technology, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is fostering a vibrant community where members can socialize, trade, and participate in exciting sports-related activities. Why Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s Stage 3 Presale Success Matters Completing 97% of Stage 3 in its presale is no small feat, especially in a market as competitive as cryptocurrency. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s ability to draw in investors during this crucial phase signals strong market confidence and enthusiasm for the project. The presale success also sets the stage for a potential price surge once Mpeppe (MPEPE) goes live on major exchanges. Investors who participated in the presale are positioning themselves to benefit from the token’s future growth, especially given its unique combination of sports engagement and decentralized finance (De-Fi). With a growing community and the backing of blockchain technology, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is poised to make a significant impact once fully launched. Floki Inu Investors Look to Mpeppe (MPEPE) for Better Returns Floki Inu (FLOKI)’s decline has led investors to explore other memecoin opportunities, with Mpeppe (MPEPE) emerging as a top contender due to its strong presale performance and innovative blend of sports, memes, and crypto. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s focus on soccer and gaming, combined with its transparent use of blockchain technology, makes it an attractive option for long-term growth and community involvement. Conclusion: A Market Shift in Memecoins In September, the cryptocurrency market experienced a significant drop, with Floki Inu (FLOKI) experiencing a 22.1% drop and Mpeppe (MPEPE) completing 97% of its Stage 3 presale.

33302117,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640511,1725721216,Crypto Analyst Have High Expectations For Solana (SOL) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) In 2024,"As we move through the final months of 2024, the cryptocurrency market remains a dynamic space filled with both challenges and opportunities. Two cryptocurrencies that are drawing significant attention from analysts and investors alike are Solana (SOL) and Mpeppe (MPEPE). While Solana (SOL) has faced a tough year, marked by volatility and declining user engagement, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is emerging as a promising contender in the meme coin market. Analysts are closely watching these two tokens, each representing different segments of the crypto market, for potential gains in the coming months. Solana (SOL)’s Struggle to Reclaim Support Solana (SOL) has been one of the most talked-about cryptocurrencies this year, but not always for the right reasons. After an impressive run in 2023, 2024 has been a year of significant challenges for SOL. The token has recently slipped below the $130 mark, marking a 20% decline over the past 11 days. The $125 support zone, which has been a critical level for bulls, is now under severe pressure. The broader market downturn has not spared Solana (SOL), with active addresses on the network dropping sharply. From a peak of 33.15 million in July, active addresses have plummeted to just 11.1 million in August. This decline in user engagement is a worrying sign, as it could foreshadow further price erosion. If SOL fails to hold the $125 level, it could slide to the next significant support zones at $110 and $100—levels that have previously provided strong support earlier in the year. The Technical Outlook From a technical perspective, Solana (SOL)’s price action hints at deeper troubles. A looming death cross between the 50-day and 200-day EMAs signals a potential breakdown rally, adding to the bearish sentiment. However, there is a glimmer of hope in the form of a bullish divergence in the daily RSI, which hints at a possible double-bottom reversal. For this bullish scenario to materialize, SOL would need to reclaim its 200-day EMA at $140 and its 50-day EMA at $147. A breakout above $163, the peak of previous double-top formations, would signal a potential trend reversal. Adding to the complexity is the steady offloading by Solana (SOL) whales. A major holder has sold 695,000 SOL since January, valued at $99.5 million, though they still hold a substantial amount of 1.88 million SOL. This ongoing liquidation suggests further downside risk for Solana (SOL), and the market’s current trajectory remains bearish unless a significant catalyst emerges. Mpeppe: Carving Out A Niche While Solana (SOL) battles to reclaim its support levels, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is carving out a niche for itself in the meme coin market. Unlike Solana (SOL), which has faced challenges due to declining user engagement and whale sell-offs, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is benefiting from strong community support and a successful presale. The meme coin has quickly gained traction, with analysts predicting significant upside potential as it moves towards its official launch. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s appeal lies in its combination of humor, community engagement, and the potential for high returns—qualities that have made it a standout in the meme coin space. As Solana (SOL) holders grapple with uncertainty, many are turning to Mpeppe (MPEPE) as an alternative investment with promising potential. Conclusion As 2024 progresses, both Solana (SOL) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) present interesting opportunities for investors, albeit in different ways. Solana (SOL)’s ability to reclaim key support levels will be crucial in determining its future trajectory. However, the ongoing challenges, including whale sell-offs and declining user engagement, suggest that the road ahead may be bumpy. On the other hand, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is emerging as a strong contender in the meme coin market, with the potential for significant gains as it moves closer to its official launch. For investors looking to navigate the complexities of the crypto market, keeping an eye on both Solana (SOL) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) could prove to be a wise decision.

During this period, the price of the largest cryptocurrency has dipped below $53,000 reaching a price low last seen in early August. Interestingly, despite Bitcoin’s low prices, investors are showing an unusual drop in buying interest. Related Reading: Why Has Bitcoin Been Bearish Lately? CryptoQuant Head Chimes In Investors Hold Back On Bitcoin Accumulation – What Could Be Behind It? In an X post on Friday, Ali Martinez noted that the Accumulation Trend Score (ATS) for Bitcoin was nearing zero. For context, the ATS measures the balance between accumulation and distribution activities in the Bitcoin market. As explained by Martinez, a score nearing 0 suggests that BTC investors are either offloading their holdings (distributing) or actively purchasing (accumulating) the premier cryptocurrency. This trend, which represents a decline in buying interest, can be interpreted as unusual amidst Bitcoin price loss, which provides an opportunity for token accumulation at lower prices using dollar cost averaging strategies. A possible reason for this decline in ATS could be investors believe the BTC market is yet to bottom out, which will provide an attractive point of entry. Interestingly, co-founder of Bitmex, Arthur Hayes, has predicted Bitcoin could likely fall below $50,000 this weekend amidst its present downtrend. However, Hayes has provided no specific support level for the crypto asset.

With a decline of nearly 10% in the first week, it is possible Bitcoin will experience a total double-digit loss by month’s end as in 2014 and 2019. However, the latest data from Non-Farm Payroll shows an increase in US jobs by 142,000 as well as an employment rate of 4.2%. Based on these figures, Citi analysts have previously predicted the US Federal Reserve could implement a 25 to 50 basis points rate cut at its meeting on September 18.

This major upgrade has introduced new decentralized governance models to the blockchain, allowing ADA holders to directly vote on decisions that impact the network. Despite these advancements, some investors are starting to question whether ADA will maintain its relevance and growth potential into 2024, especially in the face of other emerging projects like Mpeppe (MPEPE), which is gaining momentum in the crypto world. The Chang Hard Fork: A New Era for Cardano (ADA) The Chang Hard Fork, implemented with Block 10,764,778, introduces CIP-1694, a governance model that gives ADA holders a direct say in the decision-making process of the network. This marks a significant step toward full decentralization, a long-term goal for Cardano (ADA). The Cardano (ADA) Foundation has celebrated this achievement, describing it as a move towards a “fully autonomous and decentralized network.” The governance structure now includes three bodies: the Governance Committee, Delegate Representatives (dReps), and Stake Pool Operators (SPOs). Together, these entities will oversee the decision-making processes on the Cardano (ADA) blockchain. Hoskinson’s Response and the Community’s Doubts In response to these discussions, Hoskinson addressed the community directly, questioning why some people think he is not technically involved in the project. “I’m not involved technically? What the hell do people think that I do at IOG?” he tweeted, expressing frustration over the perception that his role at IOG has diminished. Despite the ongoing debate about Hoskinson’s future role, Cardano (ADA) continues to push forward with its decentralized governance efforts. The next phase of governance changes is expected within the next 90 days, which will build upon the foundations laid by the first phase of the Chang Hard Fork. Cardano (ADA)’s Price and Market Outlook Despite the technological advancements, ADA’s price has struggled to gain significant upward momentum. After the Chang Hard Fork, ADA was trading at around $0.32, down by 2.04% in the last 24 hours. The broader market downturn has left some investors wondering whether ADA can continue to grow in 2024, especially as competition intensifies with other blockchain projects and meme coins like Mpeppe (MPEPE) gaining attention. Mpeppe and Competing Projects As ADA holders watch the evolving governance structures and debate Hoskinson’s role, other projects like Mpeppe (MPEPE) are gaining traction. Mpeppe (MPEPE), a new meme coin in the presale phase, has captivated investors with its potential for high returns and a strong community-driven model. Priced at $0.0021, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers an alternative investment opportunity, particularly for those looking to diversify away from more established tokens like ADA. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s appeal lies in its blend of meme culture and potential for rapid price growth. The project has already attracted attention from several high-profile investors, some of whom are moving their funds away from ADA in search of higher returns. The contrast between Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s momentum and ADA’s more gradual growth has led some Cardano (ADA) investors to question whether ADA can maintain its market relevance in the year ahead. What’s Next for Cardano (ADA)? For ADA to remain a top contender in 2024, it will need to demonstrate that its governance model can lead to tangible improvements in the network and, most importantly, that it can deliver value to its holders. With Charles Hoskinson continuing to influence the platform’s direction, and the community taking a more active role in governance, Cardano (ADA)’s success will depend on the collective efforts of its stakeholders to drive meaningful progress. Whether ADA can maintain its relevance against emerging competitors like Mpeppe (MPEPE) remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: the stakes have never been higher for Cardano (ADA)’s future.

33300615,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640505,1725718532,3 Reasons Why XRP and Mpeppe Will 100x Before September 2024 End,"As the crypto market continues its rollercoaster journey in 2024, many coins have seen dramatic shifts in price and sentiment. Ripple (XRP) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are two such cryptocurrencies that have recently caught the eye of investors. While XRP is embroiled in an ongoing battle with the SEC, Mpeppe, a meme coin in its presale stages, has been making waves in the market. Despite the current market challenges, these two coins have the potential to deliver massive gains by the end of September 2024. Here are three reasons why XRP and Mpeppe (MPEPE) could see a 100x growth. Ripple’s SEC Appeal To Judge and Its Impact on XRP Ripple (XRP) has been in the spotlight for several years due to its legal battles with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In recent months, Ripple had seemingly reached a settlement, agreeing to pay a $125 million fine. However, a last-minute twist occurred on September 4, 2024, when Ripple filed a request for amendments to the settlement. This unexpected move has left investors wondering about Ripple’s future and hedge their portfolios with other crypto’s such as Meppe (MPEPE). Despite the legal uncertainty, XRP has managed to hold onto some key support levels, such as 54 cents, but it faces significant resistance ahead. Analysts believe that if XRP can overcome its current bearish momentum and break through the 50-cent support, the token could rally. A successful outcome in the SEC appeal could act as a massive catalyst for XRP, pushing it towards new highs before the end of 2024. Moreover, Ripple (XRP) continues to innovate with the upcoming launch of its stablecoin, RLUSD, which could further strengthen its market position. With the legal battles potentially behind it and new products on the horizon, XRP has the potential to experience a significant rally in the coming months. Mpeppe (MPEPE) Presale Gains Explosive Momentum While Ripple (XRP) is dealing with legal hurdles, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is capturing the attention of investors through its presale stages. Mpeppe is currently in Stage 4 of its presale, with 66% of the tokens already sold. The total amount raised so far is over $1.9 million, with 1.58 billion tokens sold. As the presale nears completion, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has been making waves due to its meme-driven community and potential for explosive growth. The current price of 1 MPEPE token is 0.0021 USDT, and investors are flocking to buy into the presale as they anticipate significant returns once the token officially hits the market. Mpeppe (MPEPE) has already proven its popularity, with demand driving the presale closer to the final stages. Investors using the promo code “MPEPE20” are even receiving a 20% bonus on their purchases, which adds further incentive to join in before the presale ends. Mpeppe’s meme coin status, combined with its strong community backing and strategic presale stages, suggests that it has the potential to deliver significant returns, particularly in a market where meme coins have historically performed well. Market Sentiment and the Meme Coin Hype The crypto market is no stranger to hype, and meme coins like Mpeppe (MPEPE) thrive in this environment. The success of coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu has shown that meme coins can attract massive attention and deliver exponential returns when the market sentiment is in their favor. Mpeppe (MPEPE) is positioning itself to be the next big meme coin, with a solid presale performance and a growing community of investors. In contrast, Ripple (XRP) continues to be a major player in the altcoin market, with its price movements closely tied to broader market sentiment. If XRP manages to break through key resistance levels and if the legal issues with the SEC are resolved favorably, Ripple could see a resurgence in interest, driving its price upwards. For both XRP and Mpeppe (MPEPE), timing is key. The cryptocurrency market is volatile, and investors are always on the lookout for the next big opportunity. Mpeppe (MPEPE), with its meme coin appeal and growing presale momentum, could attract a wave of new investors seeking to capitalize on the next 100x opportunity. Similarly, if XRP manages to shake off its legal troubles, it could rally to new heights by the end of September. A 100x Opportunity for XRP and Mpeppe (MPEPE) in 2024? Ripple’s (XRP) ongoing legal battle with the SEC and Mpeppe’s (MPEPE) strong presale performance have positioned both tokens as potential breakout stars before the end of September 2024. Ripple (XRP) has the potential to surge if it can resolve its legal issues and deliver on its new products, such as the RLUSD stablecoin. On the other hand, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is riding the wave of meme coin hype and could deliver substantial returns as its presale continues to gain momentum. With both XRP and Mpeppe (MPEPE) offering unique value propositions in the market, they are definitely two cryptocurrencies to watch closely. While Ripple (XRP) fights to reclaim its former glory, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is emerging as a promising alternative for investors looking for high-growth opportunities in the meme coin space. For those looking to diversify their portfolios and capitalize on potential 100x gains, both XRP and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are worth considering before September 2024 comes to an end.

33300509,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640502,1725718367,"45 Days Green Candle For This New Casino Meme Coin, Sui (SUI) Sharks Take Long Position on Mpeppe at $0.0021","As the cryptocurrency market continues to experience volatility, some coins are thriving while others face significant challenges. One standout performer recently has been the new casino meme coin, Mpeppe (MPEPE), which has posted an incredible 45 consecutive days of green candles. While the broader market has shown uncertainty, Sui (SUI) sharks have noticed Mpeppe’s impressive rally and are taking long positions on this meme coin, currently priced at $0.0021. Mpeppe (MPEPE): A Meme Coin that Keeps On Giving Mpeppe (MPEPE) has emerged as a fast-growing meme coin with significant traction in recent weeks. Its presale has been met with overwhelming demand, with Stage 4 of the presale already 66% sold out. The current price of $0.0021 has attracted attention from both retail investors and institutional players, particularly from Sui (SUI) investors who are looking for opportunities in an otherwise slow market. Mpeppe’s casino-themed ecosystem has struck a chord with the community, offering not only humor and virality but also real use cases in the gambling and decentralized finance (DeFi) space. The project’s success can be attributed to its strong community backing, potential for exponential gains, and viral marketing that has helped drive its token price upward even as other cryptocurrencies falter. Sui (SUI): A Technology-Driven Project with Hurdles Sui (SUI), known for its groundbreaking technological advancements, has been a notable player in the crypto market. Developed by Mysten Labs, Sui aims to make financial access available to underserved communities globally, particularly through its offline cryptocurrency transaction technology. This technology allows users to conduct transactions without the need for an internet connection, a game-changer for regions with limited financial and technological infrastructure. This innovation has garnered attention for its potential to bridge the financial divide, particularly in areas such as Africa, where traditional banking services are often inaccessible. Sui’s use of mobile networks and electromagnetic waves to transmit transactions offline demonstrates the project’s commitment to enhancing financial inclusion. However, despite these technological advances, Sui has faced challenges in the market. Since its debut in May 2023, the SUI token has experienced a significant price collapse of 65%, now priced at $0.81. The market downturn has left Sui investors looking for alternative opportunities to recoup losses and capitalize on new trends—enter Mpeppe (MPEPE). Sui Sharks Take Notice of Mpeppe’s 45-Day Rally As Sui investors seek to diversify their portfolios, many are turning to Mpeppe (MPEPE) as a promising investment. The meme coin’s unprecedented 45-day green candle streak has caught the attention of Sui sharks, who are now taking long positions in Mpeppe. With Mpeppe’s presale showing no signs of slowing down, these investors are hoping to ride the wave of success that Mpeppe has built. This shift in focus from Sui to Mpeppe is understandable given the current market conditions. While Sui’s long-term technological goals are commendable, the immediate returns offered by Mpeppe’s rapid growth make it an attractive option for those looking to capitalize on short-term gains. The casino meme coin’s strong community support and viral appeal have created a momentum that is difficult to ignore. Mpeppe’s Appeal to Institutional Investors Mpeppe’s success isn’t just drawing in retail investors; institutional traders are also paying attention. The coin’s steady growth, combined with the community’s enthusiasm, has made it a prime target for larger investors seeking to capitalize on emerging trends in the cryptocurrency market. With each stage of the presale being rapidly sold out, Mpeppe is positioning itself as a meme coin with serious potential for long-term growth. For Sui investors who have been waiting for the SUI token to break its $1 barrier, Mpeppe offers a compelling alternative. With Mpeppe’s price currently at $0.0021 and rising quickly, investors are seeing an opportunity to get in early on a project that could deliver significant returns. The Future’s Looking Bright For Mpeppe As the market continues to fluctuate, Mpeppe’s (MPEPE) ability to maintain a 45-day streak of green candles is a testament to its strength in an otherwise challenging environment. The casino meme coin’s presale success, combined with the growing interest from both retail and institutional investors, suggests that Mpeppe could be poised for even more growth in the coming months. For Sui investors, Mpeppe represents a chance to diversify and take part in the booming meme coin market, while still holding onto their long-term positions in Sui. As Mpeppe continues to gain momentum, its potential for 100x gains becomes increasingly realistic, making it an attractive option for those looking to capitalize on the next big thing in the crypto space. In conclusion, Mpeppe’s rise comes at a time when the market is looking for new and exciting opportunities. Sui sharks and retail investors alike are flocking to this fast-growing meme coin, and with the momentum building, Mpeppe’s future looks incredibly bright. Whether or not Sui breaks its $1 barrier, Mpeppe is well on its way to becoming a major player in the meme coin market.

33300404,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640499,1725718141,"Ethereum Drops 8.12% Creating Uncertainty Within ETH Community, Investors Enter Mpeppe To Save Portfolio","The cryptocurrency market has been experiencing significant downward pressure, with major coins like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) leading the charge. On September 6, 2024, Ethereum witnessed a sharp drop of 8.12%, causing a wave of uncertainty within the ETH community. This recent decline has left investors scrambling for alternative opportunities to protect their portfolios from further losses. One of the standout contenders that investors are turning to is Mpeppe (MPEPE), a meme coin that has been defying the bearish sentiment, experiencing a massive 150% rally during its presale. Investors Seeking Alternative Routes: Mpeppe (MPEPE) Shines As Ethereum’s price continues to bleed, many ETH investors are actively seeking out new opportunities to protect their portfolios. One of the emerging winners in this climate of uncertainty is Mpeppe (MPEPE), a meme coin that has been gaining significant traction in recent weeks. Unlike Ethereum, which has seen outflows and declining prices, Mpeppe has been riding a wave of enthusiasm, particularly during its presale, which has now entered Stage 4. Mpeppe’s presale has raised over $1.8 million, with 66.33% of tokens sold. The token’s presale price currently stands at $0.0021 USDT, making it an attractive option for investors looking to diversify their portfolios and capture potential gains. With Mpeppe defying the broader market trends, it is fast becoming the go-to choice for those looking to escape the bearish grip of Ethereum and other major altcoins. Ethereum’s Decline Triggers Market Decline Ethereum’s recent drop of 8.12% follows a broader decline in the crypto market. Over the past 24 hours, the total market value of cryptocurrencies has fallen below $2 trillion, reflecting a significant 1.94% decrease to $1.96 trillion. This market-wide downtrend has raised concerns among investors, especially those holding Ethereum. As ETH’s price slipped to $2,351, the decline has led to increased outflows from its ETF products, amounting to -$152.72k, according to tracking services. Market sentiment surrounding Ethereum has shifted drastically, with the crypto fear and greed index dropping to a worrying 22, indicating “extreme fear.” Historically, September has been a month where the bears dominate the market, and Ethereum’s sharp decline only adds to the concerns that ETH might struggle to regain momentum anytime soon. Why Mpeppe Stands Out in a Bear Market Mpeppe’s strong presale performance is driven by several key factors. First, the meme coin’s growing community has shown immense support, helping to create a buzz that has translated into rising demand for the token. Second, its low price during the presale makes it an appealing investment for those looking to enter at an early stage with the hope of realizing significant returns once the coin is officially launched. Furthermore, as the broader market struggles, meme coins like Mpeppe often benefit from speculative interest. Investors, especially those disillusioned by the performance of established cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, are drawn to the potential of high-risk, high-reward projects. Mpeppe’s 150% rally during its presale demonstrates that, even in a down market, there are opportunities for significant gains. Ethereum’s Uncertain Short-Mid Term Future While Mpeppe continues to gain momentum, Ethereum’s future remains uncertain. Despite being the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ETH has been unable to maintain its price above critical support levels. Currently trading at $2,351, Ethereum faces the risk of further declines if market sentiment does not improve. Analysts have warned that ETH could drop to as low as $2,200, putting additional pressure on the already-fragile confidence of investors. The current bearish trend for Ethereum is further exacerbated by the broader market’s performance. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, has also seen significant losses, with its price falling to $55,728. As Bitcoin and Ethereum struggle to find support, the entire altcoin market has been dragged down with them, leading to increased selling pressure across the board. Is Mpeppe as a Safe Haven? In the face of Ethereum’s recent 8.12% drop and the broader market downturn, investors are increasingly turning to alternative assets like Mpeppe (MPEPE) to save their portfolios. With its strong presale performance, growing community support, and potential for significant gains, Mpeppe stands out as a promising investment opportunity in an otherwise bearish market. While Ethereum’s future remains clouded by uncertainty, Mpeppe’s momentum shows no signs of slowing down. As the token moves through Stage 4 of its presale, raising over $1.8 million, investors are quickly realizing that this meme coin could be the key to weathering the current storm in the crypto market. With Ethereum struggling to regain its footing, Mpeppe offers a glimmer of hope for those looking to diversify and capitalize on new opportunities.

If selling pressure increases, it could find support around $16.00. AVAX’s long-term potential is strong, with increasing institutional interest and user adoption. Mpeppe (MPEPE): Why This Presale Is Attracting Attention While Injective Protocol (INJ) and Avalanche (AVAX) are well-established in the market, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is quickly gaining traction as one of the most talked-about new tokens.

The Mpeppe (MPEPE) presale has attracted significant attention, particularly from investors looking for high-growth potential in an emerging market. Why Mpeppe (MPEPE) Is Gaining Momentum Mpeppe (MPEPE) is more than just a memecoin—it offers real utility through its DeFi integration and gaming platform.

Users can participate in yield farming, liquidity mining, and stake, while the platform ensures fair gameplay and transparent results, enhancing user trust and engagement.

Key Report Explains ETH Struggles,"Ethereum (ETH) is currently facing significant selling pressure and fear after a 23% decline, bringing its price down to yearly lows at $2,200. One major concern for investors is the ongoing underperformance of ETH compared to Bitcoin, a trend that has persisted since September 2022. Since then, Ethereum has fallen 44% against Bitcoin. Related Reading: Ethereum (ETH) Triangle Formation Hints At A Double Bottom: Breakout and New ATH? This dramatic drop has left investors and traders questioning the reasons behind Ethereum’s struggle. A recent report from CryptoQuant offers some clarity, pointing to several factors that may be affecting ETH performance. As market participants continue to monitor ETH’s movements, many are left wondering whether the asset can regain momentum or if further downside is to be expected in the coming weeks. Ethereum Exposed: CryptoQuant Report Sheds Light The recent report from CryptoQuant offers clarity on factors currently affecting Ethereum (ETH). Declining on-chain activity, shrinking institutional interest, and the underwhelming performance of Ethereum ETFs compared to Bitcoin are among the key contributors to Ethereum’s struggles, with the ETH/BTC pair now sitting at 0.0425, its lowest level since April 2021. Ethereum’s underperformance seems to be tied to weaker network activity dynamics compared to Bitcoin. For instance, Ethereum’s total transaction fees have continued to decline, mostly attributed to the lower fees after the Dencun upgrade. The relative transaction count has also fallen dramatically, dropping from a record high of 27 in June 2021 to 11, one of the lowest levels since July 2020. Moreover, Ethereum’s supply dynamics are not supportive of a price increase. Since early April, the total supply of ETH has steadily grown following the Dencun upgrade. The current supply is at 120.323 million ETH, the highest level since May 2023. Related Reading: Ethereum Enters Oversold Territory, Can The Pump Send It To $6,000? Additionally, traders and investors have shown a clear preference for Bitcoin over Ethereum, as the relative spot trading volume of ETH to Bitcoin has dropped from 1.6 to 0.76 in the past week. Ethereum’s price has historically risen relative to Bitcoin when its trading volume outperforms Bitcoin’s. Given these factors, Ethereum may continue to underperform compared to Bitcoin in the near future. ETH Price Action Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading at $2,262 after a significant 23% drop from its local highs. Volatility and uncertainty continue to drive the market as ETH tests local demand near its yearly lows of around $2,200. The cryptocurrency remains far below its 4-hour 200 moving average (MA) at $2,565, a critical indicator that typically signals market strength. For bulls to regain control, it is essential for the price to break above this moving average and challenge the local highs at $2,600. Related Reading: Bitcoin Fear And Greed Index Falls To ‘Extreme Fear’ As BTC Dips Below $54,000 However, if Ethereum fails to hold support at its yearly low of $2,200, the price will likely enter a deeper correction phase, potentially signaling the start of a bear market. This level is crucial for ETH’s short-term recovery, as losing it could trigger further selling pressure. Bulls need to retake these key levels to prevent ETH from slipping into prolonged bearish territory.

As a result, sentiment among crypto investors has plunged rapidly and this has caused the Fear & Greed Index to plunge into the Extreme Fear territory. This suggests that investors are less likely to put money into the market, but it could also come with good news for the market. Fear & Greed Index Sitting At Extreme Greed The Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index is one of the best indicators of telling how investors are feeling toward the market at any time. This index uses a scale of 1-100, representing sentiments ranging across Fear, Extreme Fear, Neutral, Greed, and Extreme Greed. Each of these can show how investors are feeling and could be a tell for where the Bitcoin price could be headed next from here. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Recovery To $0.000081 ATH Levels Still In Play Usually, when the Fear & Greed Index is sitting on either extreme, it could mean that the price is about to swing in the opposite direction. So, for example, the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index is in Extreme Greed could suggest that the price is about to fall, and vice versa. This trend would be positive for the Bitcoin price right now as the Fear & Greed Index has fallen into the Extreme Greed territory. As of Friday, the Fear & Greed Index had fallen as low as 22, which put it firmly in the Extreme Fear territory. Going by the Bitcoin price having a tendency to recover when the index is in the red, it could mean that the price is reaching a bottom. An example of this is when the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index fell to 20 in August, before the crypto market seeing a quick rebound. If that happens here, the Bitcoin price could be on the verge of a recovery. Bitcoin Rebound Not Likely In September While the Fear & Greed Index sitting in the Extreme Fear territory could point towards a bottom, the rebound may not materialize for a while. This is because the month of September has historically been very bearish and expectations are that this month will not be different. Related Reading: Dogecoin Moving Averages Say Accumulation Has Ended, Here’s Where Price Is Headed Next Veteran analyst Benjamin Cowen outlined this in a post on X (formerly Twitter), revealing that this month is already on track with previous September months.

33285828,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640374,1725690606,Solana On watch: SOL Price Could Crash To $90 If This Happens,"As the first week of September concluded, the Solana (SOL) price settled at $124, raising concerns for investors as the fifth largest cryptocurrency risks breaching the critical $100 threshold. According to market analyst Ali Martinez, recent technical analysis indicates that a sustained close below the channel’s lower boundary at $126 could trigger a significant price correction for Solana, potentially dropping to $110 or even $90. Solana Price Challenges In a social media update, Martinez elaborated on the current market conditions, noting that the TD Sequential indicator had previously presented a buy signal on the daily chart. This suggested a possible rebound for Solana from the lower boundary of its trading channel towards higher levels at $154 and $187. However, the broader market’s ongoing selloff has invalidated this bullish signal, causing Solana to suffer losses of approximately 20% over the past two weeks and 13% in the last month. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Recovery To $0.000081 ATH Levels Still In Play Despite these challenges, there remains a glimmer of hope for Solana’s recovery. Martinez pointed out a historical pattern indicating that Solana typically experiences a price upswing in the two weeks leading up to its “Breakpoint event”. In 2021, the cryptocurrency surged by 35%, the following year it increased by another 35%, and in 2023 it soared by 60%. With only 16 days left until the 2024 “breakpoint event,” the analyst suggests that this trend of the past few years could continue, which would mean a significant recovery for the token. If the historical pattern holds, Solana could potentially rally 35% towards $167, but remain just below the upper limit of its current channel at $187. However, as Martinez pointed out, the key is for SOL to recover and consolidate above the $126 level in the coming days to avoid further declines. Influx of Capital From FTX Creditors And Historically Bullish Q4 Further adding some sense of hope for SOL investors, the fourth quarter post-Bitcoin (BTC) Halving events has historically shown bullish trends, suggesting a potential market recovery that could also benefit SOL significantly. Adding to this hopeful outlook, the now-defunct crypto exchange FTX is set to distribute over $16 billion in cash to creditors affected by its collapse. This influx of capital into the market could signal a substantial return, particularly impacting four key cryptocurrencies. Analyst OxNobler highlights that a majority of the affected FTX clients are retail investors, indicating that a significant portion of the recovered funds is likely to re-enter the crypto market. Related Reading: Here’s How Cardano Price Will ‘Survive’ A US Recession: Crypto Analyst The expectation is that a substantial share of these funds will flow into Bitcoin and other dominant cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum (ETH), Solana, and Binance Coin (BNB). The anticipated return of capital not could stabilize the market but also present an opportunity for price increases across these assets. However, it remains to be seen if this is indeed the case, but if it is, it could be a much-needed catalyst for the market following the strong sell-off activity that the largest cryptocurrencies on the market have experienced in recent months.

33283994,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=640367,1725687047,"Bitcoin Fear And Greed Index Falls To ‘Extreme Fear’ As BTC Dips Below $54,000","On Friday, the cryptocurrency market’s Fear and Greed Index plummeted to “extreme fear,” reflecting growing anxiety among investors as the Bitcoin price dipped to a weekly low of $53,700. This downturn marks a continuation of a broader sell-off that has plagued the market, particularly since Bitcoin struggled to maintain momentum above the critical $60,000 threshold. Bitcoin Targets $53,000 Amid Bearish Sentiment The steep decline in Bitcoin’s value can be traced back to August’s significant crash, attributed to challenging macroeconomic conditions that resulted in increased liquidity exiting risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, September has historically been a bearish month for Bitcoin, with an average negative return of 6%. As of now, just six days into the month, Bitcoin has already recorded an 8% decline, a trend that market expert Benjamin Cowen suggests could align with typical September behavior if the month concludes at this rate. Related Reading: Here’s How Cardano Price Will ‘Survive’ A US Recession: Crypto Analyst However, further price retracements could occur if key support levels fail to hold. Analyst Justin Bennett pointed out that Bitcoin appears to be heading towards a target of $53,000 after a failed attempt to retest its all-time high of $69,000, which was achieved at the end of August. Bennett indicated that while the situation remains fluid, there is potential for a brief relief rally in the $52,000 to $53,000 range before a deeper correction could lead the price down to $48,000. Another analyst, Michael van de Poppe, has also weighed in on the current market dynamics, stating that the market may have overreached by taking liquidity from above. Van de Poppe anticipates that Bitcoin will likely test the $53,000 level before any upward movement occurs. For Bitcoin to regain its footing, van de Poppe emphasizes the necessity of reclaiming the $56,000 mark following the recent dip. Key Factors That Could Catalyze BTC’s Price Recovery Despite this bearish sentiment dominating the market, BTC investor Lark Davis remains optimistic about the future, suggesting that the next six months could be pivotal for Bitcoin and the broader market, regardless of recent price corrections. One of Davis’ key points is the upcoming fourth quarter, which has historically been a bullish period for BTC, especially in Halving years. In addition, he highlights the rising M2 money supply, which could lead to more capital being injected into the market, further fueling a potential rally. Davis also discusses the possibility of rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve, which analysts suggest could act as a significant catalyst for BTC’s price. Should the Fed implement cuts of 25 basis points, it could create a more favorable environment for the entire crypto market. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Recovery To $0.000081 ATH Levels Still In Play Another critical factor Davis points to is the upcoming US election, which is just 60 days away. As reported by NewsBTC, a potential return of former President Donald Trump could positively impact the crypto market. Trump has indicated plans to put BTC at the forefront of his economic agenda, including loosening regulations and fostering a more supportive environment for cryptocurrencies. This shift could instill greater confidence among investors and potentially boost BTC prices significantly. However, it remains to be seen what the next few days will bring for the Bitcoin price as the bearish sentiment in the market is palpable, but with October holding potential gains as has historically happened in past years.

42390405,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd1YOn,1725683889,CFTC Pleads With Judge to Block Kalshi Election Contracts for 14 Days,"Hours after losing a long-running court case filed by U.S. prediction market platform Kalshi, regulators are making a hail Mary pass.  Late Friday, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission filed an emergency motion asking a federal judge to grant a temporary stay of her decision in Kalshi's favor. The stay would prevent Kalshi from listing election markets for at least 14 days.  Last year, the CFTC forbade Kalshi from listing contracts betting on which party would control each house of Congress after the November election. Such contracts, the agency said, would amount to unlawful gaming and would be ""contrary to the public interest."" Kalshi then sued, calling the regulator's decision ""arbitrary [and] capricious.""  In a ruling handed down Friday, Judge Jia M. Cobb, of the U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia, sided with Kalshi but did not give her rationale, which she said she would spell out in a subsequent opinion. She did not say when that opinion would be published.  Kalshi triumphantly declared on its website: ""We did it! U.S. election markets are coming to Kalshi.""  The CFTC then filed its emergency motion asking Cobb to stay her order for 14 days following publication of the opinion.  ""Without the benefit of the Court’s reasoning, the CFTC is unable to make an informed decision whether to appeal, nor is it able to fully brief a motion for stay pending any forthcoming appeal,"" the agency wrote.  If granted, the stay would mean Kalshi wouldn't be allowed to list its election markets until late September at the earliest. The company, which settles trades in U.S. dollars, has been locked out of this year's election betting boom, dominated by crypto-based rival Polymarket, which is barred from serving U.S. residents under its own settlement with the CFTC.

42390418,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd1ZYb,1725683400,How Might Donald Trump's Crypto Token Fit Into Regulations?,"The former president of the United States is launching a crypto yield product, even as he appeals to the crypto industry in his current bid for office. Donald Trump will be the ""chief crypto advocate"" for World Liberty Financial, a venture that has offered scant hints so far about what it will actually do.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  WLFI  The narrative  Crypto is trying to make an impact this election cycle. Now, one of the leading contenders for President of the U.S. is tied to a forthcoming crypto venture.  Why it matters  There's one pretty interesting question: how should the former president and current Republican nominee think about securities and anti-money laundering laws as he prepares to lend his name to a crypto project?  Breaking it down  Former President Donald Trump will be the ""chief crypto advocate"" for World Liberty Financial, a project seemingly based on Dough Finance and featuring his three sons and a host of other individuals in key roles, according to scoops by my colleagues Danny Nelson, Cheyenne Ligon and Sam Kessler this week.  A draft white paper seen by CoinDesk suggests that World Liberty Financial will sell 30% of the WLFI tokens generated, with the remaining 70% held by founders, service providers and other team members.  I want to focus on this part, as it raises some interesting regulatory questions. Trump, of course, has spent the past few months campaigning to crypto voters, making promises about installing industry-friendly regulators and making the U.S. the ""crypto capital of the planet"" in various public remarks.  This friendly stance, at odds with his opposition to crypto when he was actually in office, may end up benefiting him personally, given the forthcoming World Liberty Financial launch.  The major caveat here is that CoinDesk has seen draft documents; the final project may differ from what CoinDesk has reported on.  In the document CoinDesk did view, however, one common refrain has been that a 70% allocation toward existing project developers is relatively large, compared to other crypto projects.  The white paper also has a non-transferability clause, seemingly to prevent resales or suggest that investors can profit off of the tokens, at least at launch.  This alone would not be enough to bypass securities laws, said Dave Rodman, the founder and managing partner at Rodman Law Group.  ""If all that happens is that people buy tokens that are 'locked,' nothing has been done to reduce exposure to US securities laws if Americans purchase the token,"" he said.  It's also unclear, at least so far, who exactly controls the wallets, said Alexandra Damsker, an attorney and consultant.  How the 70% retained is broken down is also unclear – whether each developer and project leader will receive an equal allocation or not.  WLFI is a governance token. Holders with some yet-to-be-defined minimum number of tokens can propose protocol changes or other suggestions, and all holders can vote using up to 5% of the total number of token supply. While the paper suggests this will ""ensure fairness and distributed participation,"" any aligned group that holds a majority of tokens may be able to influence these proposals.  The white paper also included a line about screening purchasers to comply with sanctions regulations.  The project will be a key target for attackers. We've already seen this, when X (formerly Twitter) accounts tied to Lara (Eric Trump's wife) and Tiffany Trump (one of Donald Trump's daughters) were hijacked this week to shill random addresses. Eric Trump tweeted that those addresses were a scam, prompting further confusion from people who couldn't tell if this meant that World Liberty Financial itself was not real or just the addresses (to be clear: World Liberty Financial is a real project; those addresses were not part of it).

Following Bitcoin’s drop to the $55,000 mark, the cryptocurrency was among the few tokens showing green numbers with an 8% surge. The token’s performance, alongside the network’s developments, has fueled a bullish sentiment among investors. However, some analysts remain cautious of the cryptocurrency, warning that the joy could be short-lived. Related Reading: KAMA Memecoin Soars 10% Following Putin’s Endorsement Of Kamala Harris SUI Surges As Top 100’s Largest Daily Gainer SUI was among the best performers throughout August, registering 50% surges amid the market downturns. The cryptocurrency’s resilience last month was fueled by several factors, including network updates, large over-the-counter (OTC) bids, and “strong holdership through big unlocks.” Moreover, crypto asset manager Grayscale launched its investment trust, Grayscale SUI Trust, based on the cryptocurrency. As a result, the token’s bullish momentum propelled the price toward key levels not seen since mid-June. Since then, SUI has moved within a multi-month accumulation zone between the $1.2-$0.57 price range, holding the lower range as a key support area. Throughout August, the token retested the $1 resistance level several times, ultimately failing to reclaim it as a support level. As September started, SUI’s price crashed by 23% due to the market volatility, momentarily losing the $0.75 support zone. However, the cryptocurrency consolidated above this level again as the week progressed. After successfully reclaiming support at the $0.8 level, the token surged 8% on Friday morning. Its price moved toward the $0.088 mark, registering green numbers in most timeframes. SUI is currently the largest gainer among the top 100 cryptocurrencies, with a 6.3% increase in the last 24 hours. The token also displays an 8.5% and 36.8% jump in the weekly and monthly timeframes. This performance fueled a bullish sentiment among investors and market watchers. Will SUI’s Rally End Soon? Crypto analyst Alex Clay highlighted SUI’s performance in the past month, remarking its movements between the mid-zone and key support zone within the “bigger accumulation range.” To the analyst, the cryptocurrency’s price could target the $1.8 resistance level soon if it breaks above the $1.2 mark. Additionally, Clay believes the bullish momentum could drive the price to the mid and long-term targets of $3.3 and $5, although he considers these “conservative targets.” Yuriy, another crypto trader, pointed out that SUI broke out of its two-week range after today’s jump. The cryptocurrency’s chart displays a bullish flag formation, and a breakout could be attempted if the token consolidates above the current levels. Per the post, if SUI holds above the $0.84 support zone, the token’s next resistance level would be the $0.97-$1.02 range. A breakout above the $1 mark could potentially spark a big pump for the token. However, failing to hold the key support zone could lead the price to a 15% to 20% drop. Related Reading: AAVE Whale Goes On $6.78 Million Buying Spree As Price Recovers 16% Crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa suggested that SUI’s chart is “still a nice” one after its recent performance.

This is undoubtedly a bullish development for the second-largest crypto by market cap, as it looks set for a price rally that could send it as high as $6,000. ETH Ready For Liftoff Having Entered Oversold Territory Crypto analyst Titan of Crypto suggested in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Ethereum is ready for liftoff, having entered oversold territory. He noted that historically, ETH sees a rally or a short-term pump whenever the relative strength index (RSI) is in or near oversold territory on the 3-day chart. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Recovery To $0.000081 ATH Levels Still In Play While it remains to be seen whether it will be a rally or just a short-term pump, Titan of Crypto added that an upward movement looks to be around the corner for Ethereum either way. The accompanying chart the crypto analyst shared showed that ETH could reach $6,000 if it is a price rally, while the crypto will at least reach $3,000 if it is just a short-term pump. Crypto analyst Crypto Wolf also recently shared an Ethereum update and noted that sentiment is at rock bottom and herd interest in ETH is fading. He added that according to his updated chart, TH is likely approaching a bottom. In line with this, he called for patience as Ethereum will experience a bullish reversal once it finds a bottom. His accompanying chart showed that Ethereum could rise to $2,900 following a price recovery and will set its sights on $5,600 if it breaks the resistance at $3,900. Crypto analyst Poisedon also hinted at an imminent price recovery for ETH, asserting that manipulation is done and that it is time for expansion. Poseidon’s accompanying chart indicated that ETH must reclaim $2,600 if the market structure is to shift to the upside. Based on the crypto analyst’s analysis, this shift to the upside could send Ethereum as high as $3,200 in the short term. Spot Ethereum ETFs Have A Role To Play The Spot Ethereum ETFs undoubtedly play a role in any potential price recovery for ETH. According to data from SoSo Value, these funds have witnessed a cumulative total net outflow of $562.31 million since launching on July 23, thereby putting significant selling pressure on ETH’s price. Related Reading: Dogecoin Moving Averages Say Accumulation Has Ended, Here’s Where Price Is Headed Next These outflows have been largely due to selling pressure from Grasyacle’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE), similar to what happened with Grasyacle’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) after the Spot Bitcoin ETFs launched. Bitcoin dropped to as low as $38,00 back then before climbing to its current all-time high (ATH) of $73,000 after the selling pressure from Grayscale eased. Therefore, ETH could also enjoy a parabolic rally if the same situation occurs again, with selling pressure from Graysale’s ETHE easing and other Spot Ethereum ETFs witnessing impressive inflows. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at around $2,320, down over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

As the crypto market faces growing fear and uncertainty, Solana has remained one of the strongest performers this cycle, attracting attention from analysts and investors looking for opportunities. This current price zone is critical, as it will likely determine the asset’s next big move. Related Reading: Ethereum (ETH) Triangle Formation Hints At A Double Bottom: Breakout and New ATH? Traders are closely monitoring whether SOL can maintain support around $120, as holding this level could set the stage for a potential recovery and rally. However, if Solana loses this key support, the market could see a deeper correction in the coming days. With many investors eager to assess Solana’s strength in the face of broader market volatility, this battle at $120 will be pivotal for its short-term direction. All eyes are on Solana as it approaches this crucial decision point. Solana Holding Strong Since March, Solana (SOL) has been in a massive consolidation phase, trading between strong monthly support at $120 and a monthly resistance at $210. This 180-day consolidation has caught the attention of analysts, including top trader Curb, who recently shared his insights on X. Curb’s analysis highlights the significance of this prolonged range-bound action, suggesting that the move could be explosive when Solana eventually breaks above the consolidation. According to Curb, Solana is primed for a swift rally to the $400-$500 range once it breaks out of its current price range, followed by further upside to potentially $800-$1,000. His forecast is based on the strong fundamentals and technical setup Solana has maintained throughout this period of consolidation. Related Reading: Can Avalanche (AVAX) Reclaim $30? Top Analyst Predicts A Dip Before A Bounce Solana has gained increasing traction as the market evolves, both within the crypto community and from institutional investors. Its growing ecosystem, which includes decentralized applications (dApps), NFTs, and a robust developer community, has fueled optimism for long-term growth. Investors are watching closely as the price hovers near the key $120 support, awaiting a potential breakout that could propel SOL into its next bullish cycle. This consolidation phase has built up significant pressure, and the next move could define Solana’s trajectory for the rest of the cycle. SOL Price Testing Demand Solana (SOL) is trading at $129.60 after experiencing choppy price action. Volatility and uncertainty drive the market, with SOL testing a local demand zone between $122 and $135. Despite this, the price movement has a noticeable lack of strength. SOL remains below its 4-hour 200 moving average (MA), which sits at $143.76, signaling weak momentum since its recent high. For bulls to regain control, the price must break above the 4-hour 200 MA and target local supply at $160. This would be crucial to reversing the current bearish sentiment and setting the stage for a potential rally. Related Reading: Analysts Predict Solana’s Surge: $233 Target In Sight As Breakpoint Approaches However, if the price falls below the $120 support level, it could trouble investors. Such a breakdown would likely signal the end of the consolidation phase and the start of a deeper correction, potentially driving SOL to lower levels.
