42398468,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTWTO,1435183586,Blockchain Startup Raises $2 Million for Intellectual Property Solution,"A startup that uses the bitcoin blockchain to establish digital ownership of art and other creative works has raised $2m in seed funding.  Ascribe  received backing from Earlybird Venture Capital, Digital Currency Group, Freelands Ventures and a group of angel investors, according to a report by TechCrunch.  Founder Bruce Pon told the news outlet that the idea for the product first took shape in 2013, explaining:  “The idea to use blockchain to allow artists to create digital scarcity germinated in mid-2013 when [founders] Trent and Masha [McConaghy] asked ‘Can you own digital art like you own bitcoin?’""  The prototype for the project, Pon explained, was built by McConaghy in fall of 2013, with the founders leaving to pursue the project full time in 2014.  ""Since then, we’ve been refining the technology and working with early users,"" he continued.  Artists that use ascribe essentially create digital deeds for their work, which are then subsequently time-stamped onto the bitcoin blockchain. As shown below, once a file is uploaded to Ascribe, it creates a digital certificate that can be then be traded, tracked or loaned, thereby creating a chain of ownership for that work.  Proof of the transaction can then be found on the bitcoin blockchain. Ascribe utilizes an open-source protocol called SPOOL that sits on top of the bitcoin blockchain as a registry for works.  Ascribe has seen growing interest from both artists as well as companies that provide digital media, according to the company. Notably, the startup began partnering with Creative Commons France earlier this month.

42398458,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTWMV,1435181728,Overstock Reports Over $100k in Crypto Losses for Q1 2015,"UPDATE 25th June 0:00 UTC: Updated with comment from Overstock cryptocurrency group general manager Judd Bagley.      US retail giant Overstock lost $117,000 on its investments in cryptocurrencies during the first quarter of 2015, according to the company's latest quarterly earnings report.  Overstock listed its cryptocurrency holdings as valued at $233,000, down from $340,000 on 31st December.  Long one of the largest merchants in the digital currencies space, Overstock had previously indicated that it was holding as much as 10% of its proceeds from such sales in bitcoin.  The filing suggests Overstock is still holding the funds in bitcoin, as it noted subsequent increases in the value of bitcoin could be recognized in later filings. What remains unclear is whether the company is still actively adding to its holdings from bitcoin sales.  In its latest SEC filing, the company noted that it receives all bitcoin payments via a third party denominated in US dollars.  The company wrote:  ""At present we do not accept bitcoin payments directly, but use a third party vendor to accept bitcoin payments on our behalf. That third party vendor then immediately converts the bitcoin payments into US dollars so that we receive payment for the product sold at the sales price in US dollars.""  In addition to cryptocurrency, Overstock also holds nearly $10m in gold and silver as well as interest and equity in businesses that will help facilitate its plan to build a decentralized stock market.  Clarification given  Speaking to CoinDesk, Overstock cryptocurrency group general manager Judd Bagley indicated that the loss was primarily the result of declines in certain altcoin markets in which the company has invested.  ""The swing in the value of our cryptocurrency holdings is attributable to the sale of some of our non-bitcoin cryptocurrencies, the use of some of our bitcoin to pay for services including our membership in the Chamber of Digital Commerce, and changes in the market,"" he said.  He went on to clarify that the company ""holds more than just bitcoin"", but did not clarify which digital currencies Overstock has invested in.  Bagley stated that, in its quarterly filing, the holdings are considered a part of the same asset class.  ""We’ve invested in other cryptocurrencies over time, and for the purposes of the SEC filing, we lump them all together,"" he continued.  Risky business  Elsewhere, cryptocurrencies are listed as a potential legal risk for the company, with Overstock noting that penalties for non-compliance with local laws governing cryptocurrencies could ""negatively impact"" the business.  Overstock was also upfront about the risks it faces carrying out its decentralized stock market project, Medici, writing that it does not have significant internal experience with this type of project, and that it may be expensive or ultimately unsuccessful.  Such language, though, is used broadly and throughout the filing, with Overstock noting its attempts to brand the company as O.co overseas may also fail to gain traction.  Despite the risks, however, the filing suggests Overstock will continue to be long on its investment in bitcoin as a speculative asset.  ""In the future, we may transact in cryptocurrency directly or increase our cryptocurrency holdings,"" the filing states. ""This will subject us to additional exchange risk and other risks as described above, which may have an adverse effect on our results.""  Stan Higgins contributed reporting.

42398452,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTWFc,1435174932,NY Bitcoin Businesses Now Have 45 Days to Apply for BitLicense,"The New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) has officially adopted the BitLicense following the framework's publication in the New York State Register.  Now in effect, the BitLicense makes New York the first US state to formally launch a custom-made regulatory approach to bitcoin and digital currencies.  The publication in the register also kicks off a 45-day grace period, during which time companies and individuals that offer digital currency services to New York residents must apply for a BitLicense. The application deadline is 8th August.  Obtaining the BitLicense means paying a $5,000 non-refundable application fee, with the possibility of additional application costs as determined by the NYDFS, and submitting details about those running the company, their financial and legal histories and their plans for running a digital currency business.  The final version of the BitLicense states that once a business or individual has applied, they are considered compliant until a determination on their application is made. If denied, they must immediately stop doing business in New York.  The text suggests that any entity that doesn't apply faces possible sanction, noting:  ""Any person engaged in virtual currency business activity that fails to submit an application for a license within 45 days of the effective date of this regulation shall be deemed to be conducting unlicensed virtual currency business activity.""  Yet, the BitLicense text itself is silent on the issue of how non-compliant businesses might be cited or penalized. When reached for clarity, a representative for the NYDFS declined to comment on how enforcement actions may be taken.  The NYDFS is expected to post an update on its official website regarding the official launch of the BitLicense and the commencement of the 45-day grace period.

42398457,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTWKX,1435172524,"Deal Brings Bitcoin Option to Over 20,000 Japanese Retailers","A deal between bitcoin exchange Quoine and payments network Econtext will allow more than 20,000 online and eventually physical merchants to accept bitcoin in Japan.  The move essentially allows merchants that already use Econtext's payment processing services in thousands of online stores to accept bitcoin payments without the need for a bitcoin-specific processor. The service will be available for businesses to use today.  Quoine  CEO Mario Gomez Lozada said his company had entered into discussions with Econtext last year, and has since done extensive integration work to connect it to Quoine's payments platform.  Gomez Lozada told CoinDesk:  ""For us, it's a pretty significant deal.""  According to Gomez Lozada, Econtext has signed up a couple of merchants to accept bitcoin already and is actively approaching others.  The partnership could spur a large increase in the number of bitcoin-accepting merchants in Japan, where adoption has been slower than in other nations due to negative media attention from the Mt Gox insolvency.  How the system works  Quoine's exchange interfaces with the merchant's checkout system, supplying a bitcoin price for the merchant to quote to the customer.  The quoted rate is locked in for both customer and merchant for 30 minutes, even if bitcoin fluctuates wildly in that time. Econtext supplies a payment method selection screen for its merchants to use, which will now feature a bitcoin option and display QR codes customers can use to make the payment.  The company is a recently-acquired subsidiary of Digital Garage Inc, a Japan-based technology investment company. It provides 'settlement services' for businesses, working with payment systems like credit cards, electronic money and loyalty points, as well as convenience stores, banks and communications carrier bills.  Quoine bolsters offering  Known more to professional forex traders than general consumers, Singapore-based Quoine claims to be the highest-volume bitcoin exchange operating in the Japanese yen market.  Gomez-Lozada said the exchange currently averages volumes of between 500 and 1,000 BTC a day, with that number leaping much higher on special days and holiday periods.  ""Our growth has been quite significant in terms of volume, it's been quite amazing and we continue to see volumes going up.""  As well as bitcoin, Quoine allows accounts in 10 fiat currencies.  Quoine recently enabled the ability to trade bitcoin through other fiat currencies on its platform. While users could previously only trade with their local fiat currency, they may now speculate for profit on another level by trading BTC for other currencies using their original local balance.  The exchange also allows up to 25x margin trading (with bitcoin or fiat collateral), algorithmic trading, Japanese yen futures, interest-earning bitcoin lending and API access.

The funding  brings the public company's total fundraising to $21m since the start of 2014. Vogogo raised $8.5m in venture funding in August of last year, prior to its debut on the Toronto Stock Exchange in September.  As part of the bought financing, Beacon, Clarus and Salmon acted as the official sellers of Vogogo shares on the open market in exchange for a fee on the total proceeds.  Vogogo CEO Geoff Gordon indicated that the funds will be used by the company for key acquisitions, security deposits with banking partners and in furthering its first-mover advantage as a compliance-focused firm in the cryptocurrency space.  Gordon told CoinDesk:  ""I think there are groups that are capable of doing it, but we're clearly ahead of any potential competitors. We're here for the long haul and we want to enable this industry with good risk management and compliance.""  Gordon suggested the funds will help ""settle down"" the company's stock, which has declined from a three-month high of $3.50 per share on 10th April to a press-time total of $1.93.  Vogogo estimated it now has 20 cryptocurrency industry clients integrating with its products, with the most high-profile being exchange such as Bitstamp. However, Gordon indicated that this client pool is diversifying as the industry evolves.  ""We're just getting going with the platform, but we continue to see new groups coming to us.

42398464,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTWQR,1435161657,First Spanish University Installs Bitcoin ATM on Campus,"The number of global universities equipped with bitcoin ATMs increased on 22nd June with the announcement by Pompeu Fabra University (UPF) that it would install a unit on its Poblenou campus.  With the news, Pompeu Fabra joins MIT in the US, Simon Fraser University in Canada and the University of Zurich in Switzerland as universities that have installed bitcoin ATMs. Founded in 1990, the university boasts a community of nearly 10,000 students and an annual budget of €118M.  UPF professor of technology and communications Miquel Oliver suggested that the installation is part of the university's broader mandate to expose students to potentially disruptive new technologies.  Oliver said in a statement:  ""We want to contribute to the general discussion on how the Internet impacts our lives.""  Operator Miquel J Pavón Besalú told CoinDesk that the earnings from the ATM will be used ""to promote cryptocurrency research and for crowdfunding university projects"" related to bitcoin.  As part of its efforts to promote the ATM, UPF will team with the Barcelona Bitcoin Community, a local meetup and interest group that boasts more than 500 members, to engage the student community.  The ATM, manufactured by Boost VC-backed startup BTCPoint, allows both buy and sell functionalities and will enable students to purchase up to €1,000 in bitcoin per day.

42398465,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTWRQ,1435150882,Home Office: UK Should Create a Crime-Fighting Cryptocurrency,"The UK Home Office believes the government should consider creating its own digital currency that limits anonymity and increases the traceability of transactions.  In a response to the Treasury’s call for information on digital currency, the Home Office highlighted both the positives and negatives of existing digital currencies, such as bitcoin.  The government department, which is responsible for immigration, counter-terrorism, police and drugs policy, recognised the low cost of transactions and increased speed of payments provided by digital currencies.  However, the document, which was obtained by CoinDesk via a freedom of information request, also highlights some of the associated downsides, such as the fact cryptocurrency affords a degree of anonymity to criminals.  With this in mind, the Home Office said in its submission: “We believe that there might be a number of advantages of any digital currency for the UK being created and owned by central government.”  Restrictions  It goes on to say one major advantage of government-created digital currency is that it could be designed to limit use for criminal and terrorist purposes.  “In particular, a digital currency owned by the UK government would be controlled by a central body ... It could also be pegged to a fiat currency, to reduce potential fluctuations in its value,” the submission continues.  The response suggests a government-issued digital currency should be designed in such a way that its ownership and use can be traced, enabling law enforcement agencies to identify whether it has been used for criminal or terrorist purposes and who by. It continued:  “Access to such information would need to be restricted, but would be of use to law enforcement agency investigations and anti money laundering work. It would also have the additional benefit of acting as a deterrent to criminal use, as criminals would be unlikely to want to use a currency that it is traceable.”  Regulation should also require that any digital currency involved in criminal activity can be seized by the authorities, the department’s response states.  Preventing fraud  The Home Office highlights that, as bitcoin transactions are irreversible, fraudulent payments can be made without recourse.  It suggests a government-created cryptocurrency should be designed in such a way that fraudulent transactions can be reversed.  “It would make sense to identify how fraudulent transactions can be unwound and the digital currency reimbursed to the legitimate owner,” the submission states.  However, it does not mention that the irreversibility of transactions is seen, by some, as a positive feature of bitcoin. Many merchants favour this feature as it means they are not subject to fraudulent chargebacks.  Exchange licensing  According to the Home Office, cryptocurrency exchanges should be licensed, with their licenses withdrawn if they fail to meet certain requirements, such as the monitoring of transactions and reporting suspicious activity to the National Crime Agency.  The department suggests digital currency companies, such as wallet providers and exchanges, should be required to carry out the relevant anti money laundering and know-your-customer checks on its users.  Essentially this would mean digital currency exchanges face the same requirements as other financial institutions.  In order to ensure the success of regulation created in the UK, however, the Home Office claims international cooperation is “essential”. The response states:  “The conversion point where fiat currency becomes digital, and vice versa, is hard to oversee, given digital currencies have global reach. Without global consistency in approach, oversight and security is difficult.”  Similar themes  The Home Office response offered some similar recommendations to the response submitted by Citi’s Treasury and Trade Services Technology and Innovation Team. Citi also suggested the Treasury should consider creating its own digital currency.  The response from MasterCard, on the other hand, emphasised the risks associated with cryptocurrencies and stated that currencies such as bitcoin don’t have many, if any, strong benefits.  Another company to submit a response was Accenture, which suggested the UK government should consider regulating bitcoin wallets and apply the same identification requirements to wallet providers as it does to banks.  Action taken  Little action has been taken by the Treasury since it received responses to its call for information. In March, it published a report, stating plans to apply anti-money laundering regulations to digital currency exchanges.  The report said the Treasury will also hold a ""full consultation"" on the topic of cryptocurrencies and revealed that £10m had been earmarked for research into digital currency technology.

42398448,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTWEd,1435145432,Welshman Pleads Guilty to Silk Road 2.0 Drug Offences,"A man in Wales has pleaded guilty to drug-related charges in a case stemming from the closure of dark marketplace Silk Road 2.0.  29-year-old Cei William Owens of Aberystwyth pleaded guilty to five charges at the Swansea Crown Court on Monday – supplying or offering to supply class A and B drugs, as well as three counts of possession, according to Wales Online.  Owens, who allegedly sold magic mushrooms and cannabis on the site, was arrested as part of a National Crime Agency operation last year. Five other individuals across the UK were also arrested.  No deal with prosecutors was involved. Owens was warned by Judge Keith Thomas that ""all options remain open"" with his sentencing, despite the guilty plea.  Owens will be sentenced on 24th July, and has been released on bail.  Silk Road continued  Shortly after the demise of the original Silk Road marketplace in October 2013, a successor named (appropriately) Silk Road 2.0 sprang up in its place.  It lasted for exactly a year before being shut down as part of the FBI's 'Operation Onymous', a massive operation in November 2014 by law enforcement worldwide which resulted in the seizure of a number of dark market sites, over $1m worth of bitcoin and large quantities of cash, precious metals and drugs.  There were 17 arrests across 17 countries involved in the operation. Although the operation targeted a range of 414 'illicit sites' living on the anonymous Tor network, only 27 were marketplaces and only 15 were involved in drug trafficking.  Silk Road 2.0 and its operator 'Defcon' were said to be primary targets of the operation. A marketplace called ""Silk Road 3.0"" immediately replaced it, but was later denounced by users as a scam.

42398470,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTWUN,1435140660,New Colored Coins Implementation Released After Standard Drive Abandoned,"Though by far the most visible, the recent debate over bitcoin's maximum block size isn't the only area where the technology's decentralized decision-making processes can result in impediments to further development.  The colored coins community, for example, recently attempted to consolidate its efforts in a bid to encourage more developers to use the bitcoin blockchain as a vehicle for asset transfer. However, the attempt to merge the best of the sector's offerings to support this goal, started in late 2014, has ended without consensus.  As a result, ColoredCoins.org today released a new implementation of the colored coins protocol, one it believes can best fulfill use cases for the technology as it becomes increasingly of interest to banks and major financial institutions.  Created by ColoredCoins.org, with support from venture-backed colored coins startup Colu, the implementation uses torrents to allow for more information to be stored in colored coin metadata, comes smart contract compatible and features zero confirmation and single payment verification (SPV) wallet support.  Despite the issues in its creation, however, Colu CTO Rotem Lev believes that the effort will do much to create strong, open-source resources that he hopes will smooth future development as enterprise-level interest in bitcoin grows.  As for how well the colored coins protocol can appeal to these institutions remains to be seen, as the effort didn't succeed at making existing players in the colored coin space – ChromaWay, CoinPrism and CoinSpark – interoperable, despite the process beginning with such goals. This means certain wallets issued by one provider, for instance, won't be able to read colored coins from other wallets.  Still, Lev believes that the implementation is a step in the right direction. Even though four versions of colored coins still remain, the improved website, he believes, will attract interest to the sector of the bitcoin community and its higher goals.  Lev told CoinDesk:  ""We tried to make the other implementations better, we still are. Despite all the problems, it's still the [2.0] protocol that keeps you the closest to bitcoin and you can do everything 100% decentralized, which is the most important for us.""  Debate spoils standard  Though generally supported by most members of the ecosystem, the drive toward standardization was spearheaded by ColoredCoins.org director Amos Meiri, who is also the co-founder and CEO of Colu.  Colu's mandate, according to Lev, is to work on blockchain development more broadly. To achieve this goal, it sought to develop the colored coins protocol, a mission that necessitated the support of other members of the ecosystem.  But despite communication efforts, Lev indicated that conversation soon spiraled into a ""huge war"", with different participants unwilling to make changes to the standard that may compromise certain business advantages.  ""One of the players in the space, they wanted complete intellectual property (IP) over anything we would do together,"" Lev continued. ""If we decide we want to use that technology in a company, it has to be completely open-source. It was kind of a mess.""  Alleged conflicts  Evidence of the debate is still visible in public forums frequented by companies in the sector, which detail how ChromaWay CTO Alex Mizrahi withdrew from the ColoredCoins.org board of directors in May.  One issue, according to those who pulled support for the initiative, was the way in which communication was managed during the process.  ""Colu was supposed to organize a collaborative effort on a new standard, and invite us and other companies, but instead developed it all by itself and shared no information in the process, so there was no standardization effort so to speak,"" Mizrahi told CoinDesk.  Others like CoinSpark developer Gideon Greenspan called the effort a ""missed opportunity"", but suggested he supported increased interoperability between teams.  Greenspan went on to suggest that the ColoredCoins.org team is perhaps too close to Colu, adding: ""They decided to create their own protocol. There's a potential conflict here, because ColoredCoins.org is neutral territory, but it's under their control.""  Still, Lev countered such assertions.  ""I worked on ColoredCoins.org before Colu and I am passionate about it, we want to make it open source so it could be used by anyone,"" he said. ""The only difference is that Colu was funded to a larger scale and invested in core developers developing the protocol.""  New community resources  That's not to say that certain new features won't be available to all those in the ecosystem.  The ColoredCoins.org website, for example, will include all the implementations that request to use the resource, with the exception of ChromaWay, which has insisted that its be removed.  Also available will be an asset-aware block explorer that will track the number of colored coins assets currently in the marketplace.  Additionally, the Colu Colored Coins implementation will go live with extended documentation on API endpoints and detailed overviews for how developers can create testnet addresses, issue assets and transfer assets.  Drive toward adoption  Despite the issues that remain, Colu board member and eToro CEO Yoni Assia expressed his hope that the effort would improve the technology he helped to theorize.  For example, he said that by using torrents, colored coins will now be able to handle more complex transactions and more data in a decentralized environment.  ""When you think about colored coins, one of the core ideas that emerged is the concept of decentralized exchange,"" he said. ""A lot of the thought process was about, how do you create the out-of-the-box potential to do exchange.""  Assia expressed his hope that the colored coins sector would continue to come together to create more shared resources, especially as he believes the bitcoin protocol will need to be further optimized for asset exchange in order to attract banks and other institutions.  Lev suggested that this process wouldn't like take place overnight.  He concluded:  ""Banks don't care if one developer made it in his garage, you have to have bigger adoption, a bigger source base and that's where we're trying to get colored coins to.""
