42426047,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhzTh,1410300968,Bitcoin Foundation Deems Latest NYDFS Letter 'Disappointing',"The Bitcoin Foundation is reporting that certain information it requested from the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) under the Freedom of Information Law will not be delivered as soon as originally suggested.  The latest correspondence stated the foundation would now receive information about the BitLicense's deliberation process within 120 days. The organisation had originally hoped to receive a response within 20 dayshttps://bitcoinfoundation.org/2014/08/n-y-department-of-financial-services-promises-more-information-about-bitlicense-proposal/ of its filing.  A post penned by Jim Harper, the Bitcoin Foundation's global policy counsel, outlined what the organisation had hoped to achieve with its original filing, before revealing the updated timeline provided by the NYDFS.  Harper expressed dismay at what he believes is a delay, writing:  ""That’s in December, well after comments will close, even with the welcome extension that the NYDFS recently issued.""  The Bitcoin Foundation had previously requested evidence as to the ""extensive research and analysis"" the NYDFS conducted to determine that new regulations are needed for bitcoin businesses.  In particular, the group sought to learn about the risk management and cost-benefit analysis conducted by the NYDFS before it issued its BitLicense proposal.  Advocating for open regulation  In his remarks, Harper stressed this research and analysis would be beneficial to the broader bitcoin community as it seeks to comment constructively on the NYDFS proposal.  Harper wrote:  ""Open government laws could really produce their fullest public interest benefits if the community could access this information.""  He went on to suggest that the community's technical knowledge, coupled with the regulators' expertise, would provide fuel for policies that promote growth while implementing sufficient consumer safeguards.  Such an approach was most recently proposed by Xapo CEO Wences Casares in a blog post commenting on the NYDFS proposal. Casares even offered the services of his legal and compliance teams to the NYDFS in the hopes of helping to shape the regulation collaboratively.  Finding a silver lining  While Harper was disappointed by the turn of events, he suggested that the agency's latest letter provides ""tacit confirmation"" that the NYDFS conducted an analysis before issuing the regulatory proposal.  Harper theorized that the NYDFS would have likely informed the Bitcoin Foundation that such analysis did not exist in the letter, if that were the case.  He concluded:  ""That good news makes me all the hungrier to get the information.""  CoinDesk reached out to the NYDFS for additional comment, but did not receive an immediate response.

42426056,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhzlh,1410296418,Bitcoin Community Reacts to Apple's Mobile Payments Play,"Update (10th September 3:10 BST): Updated with additional comment from bitcoin community.      Apple has unveiled Apple Pay, a new mobile payments tool that could significantly impact the way consumers transact both in-person and digitally.  The new service was outlined as part of a broader demonstration of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, both of which were introduced at Apple's event in Cupertino, California, on 9th September.  Apple Pay is integrated with existing infrastructure, including Secure Element and Touch ID, while the iPhone 6 introduces near-field communication (NFC) functionality, enabling tap-and-go payments for users of the device.  Additionally, Apple has partnered with a cluster of well-known businesses to deploy the infrastructure for the payments feature, which includes McDonald's, Whole Foods and Disney.  Reimagining traditional payments  When launched, Apple Pay will build a bridge between the company's consumer technology and the traditional payments network.  VISA, American Express and MasterCard, the world’s biggest credit card service providers, have signed up, and the ‘Big Six’ American – Citi, Bank of America, Capital One, Wells Fargo, Chase and Barclays, among others – are also onboard.  As CEO Cook explained, Apple is seeking to invigorate what is essentially decades-old technology through the use of Apple Pay.  He said:  “We've placed a lot of energy into creating an entirely new payments solution.""  Security upgrades introduced  The inner workings of Apple Pay represent a departure from most mobile wallets and payment services. The card numbers are not shared with the merchant, nor does Apple keep track of the numbers of user transactions.  If the phone is lost, Apple Pay functionality can be suspended using the Find My iPhone service. Since the phone does not contain credit card data, there is no need to cancel credit cards in case of loss.  To make this possible, the service relies on a one-time payment number and a dynamic security code, but there is still not a lot of information on either.  Still, this seems to confirm reports of tokenization in Apple Pay. As Bank Innovation points out, Apple is using tokenization and NFC to modernize an old infrastructure and open up new long-term possibilities.  Impact on bitcoin unclear  However, the question remains: What impact will the announcement have on bitcoin and digital currency?  Apple's presentation didn't contain any new information related to bitcoin, a subject the company has been silent on since it lifted its ban on bitcoin apps in June.  However, Apple CEO Tim Cook noted during his presentation that the developer API for Apple Pay would be released, an announcement that presents a potential avenue for developers to create bitcoin-centric apps using the tool.  Although the gadget-centric tech press likes to focus on physical products, Apple's new mobile payments service is just as interesting, albeit from a different angle. What sets Apple Pay apart from the competition is the scale and comprehensiveness of Apple’s operation.  Bitcoin community reacts  The Apple event drew broad interest from around the technology industry, as well as fans of the Cupertino-based company's products and services. The iPhone 6 launch also proved to be a popular event, even temporarily overloading the event's official livestream.  Members of the bitcoin community weighed in on the developments on Twitter, contributing responses that ranged from the humorous to the critical. In some cases, commentators compared Apple Pay unfavorably to bitcoin.  As noted by bitcoin core developer Oleg Andreev:    Pay privacy: only merchant and your bank know who you are. Bitcoin: there is no bank and merchant only sees money, not your personal data.      — Oleg Andreev (@oleganza) September 9, 2014    Andreas Antonopoulos, bitcoin entrepreneur and lecturer, commented on Twitter that Apple's NFC push will put that technology in the hands of more users. Yet in the end, bitcoin will be the better option.    Apple will make NFC available everywhere. Bitcoin will make NFC usable without selling your soul to banks.      — AndreasMAntonopoulos (@aantonop) September 9, 2014    Business leaders weigh in  Reactions from the bitcoin business community followed a similar tract.  Coinsetter  CEO Jaron Lukasiewicz said that Apple's move is good for next-generation payments, as it will bring attention to issues common to traditional payments.  Still, Lukasiewicz said the bitcoin community shouldn't worry about Apple's latest launch:  ""Apple Pay is still built on top of the same old credit card payment networks and banking system. Bitcoin is therefore well-positioned to enhance Apple Pay over the long run through its integration behind the scenes, providing merchants lower costs and instant access to their funds.""  Valery Vavilov, CEO of BitFury, echoed this sentiment. saying:  “As more good intermediary solutions such as recently launched Apple Pay continue to emerge on top of the current antiquated payment network, the easier and faster will be the switch to the bitcoin payment network.”  Jeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle, further asserted that Apple Pay won't be able to compete with bitcoin long term, citing issues with legacy payment structures.  Allaire told CoinDesk:  ""As many in the Bitcoin community have already noted, while this is an improvement in user convenience and security, it's still ultimately built on the 'old rails' of the card networks and the existing bank interchange fee structure.""  New advancements possible  Others in the bitcoin community were quick to seize on this line of thinking, pointing out the mainstream services that now support both Apple Pay and bitcoin.  Noted bitcoin investor Barry Silbert tweeted his observation that online commerce giant Stripe will support both methods of payment, which could spur new development opportunities for bitcoin.    Stripe + bitcoin + Apple Pay = use bitcoin everywhere Apple Pay accepted? https://t.co/ZXk3udTocC https://t.co/avGiFu3TSp      — Barry Silbert (@barrysilbert) September 9, 2014    Similarly, mobile payments platform provider Braintree, which yesterday announced it would soon enable bitcoin payments through a partnership with Coinbase, was quick to inform its community about potential support for Apple Pay.    @scottymac We will support processing w. ApplePay. Already work w. many of the partners Apple announced. More info to come on this shortly. — Braintree (@braintree) September 9, 2014          Allaire ended his statements to CoinDesk by suggesting Apple Pay would pave the way for new opportunities for bitcoin developers due to its inclusion of NFC support for iOS devices.  Allaire concluded:  ""It will be exciting to see how the industry rallies around these new facilities for touchless mobile payments using digital currency.""

42426037,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhzJh,1410292839,Satoshi Nakamoto's Email Hacker Allegedly in Talks With Bitcoin Creator,"The story of the hacker who claims to have compromised an email account belonging to Satoshi Nakamoto just got a little stranger.  News that Nakamoto's original accounts on GMX.com were compromised ignited community interest in both the identity and whereabouts of the bitcoin creator this weekend. It was then that an email sent to a Bitcoin Talk administrator indicated that an unidentified party had taken over the accounts and threatened to release sensitive information.  There now appears to be at least two individuals in control of the email account – one of which may be Nakamoto, VICE reported today. According to information provided by one of the people involved in the situation, both parties, including Nakamoto, are engaged in ongoing negotiations.  The publication was contacted by two separate persons, one of whom claimed that he had infiltrated the account for fun. This individual said that previous statements regarding how the bitcoin creator’s identity would be publicly revealed were false. After communication between the individual and VICE ended, the publication received additional information that suggested multiple parties were using the email.  VICE continued:  “After our conversation petered off with the first individual who had access to Nakamoto's account, Motherboard was quickly contacted again from Nakamoto's old email account […] This person told us that the first individual we were speaking to was in fact Satoshi Nakamoto.”  Hacker motives revealed  The second individual, who during conversation with VICE went by the online alias Degavas1337, said that the email account’s contents had enabled him to establish Nakamoto’s true identity and make contact.  The person also shed light onto the motives behind the attack, with the hacker explaining that he or she was motivated by both personal amusement and a desire to make bitcoins.  VICE Canada managing editor Patrick McGuire wrote:  “When I asked why Degavas1337 was targeting Nakamoto, he told me 'Because I can.' After inquiring what he was trying to get out of all this, he said ‘Bitcoins, obviously… [But] don't forget the lulz.’ [...] When I asked if he was currently blackmailing Nakamoto, he refused to answer.”  The hacker added that, for now, the information about Nakamoto’s identity will remain private. He or she said that they had originally planned to steal the stash of bitcoins owned by Nakamoto, but opted to use any information against the bitcoin creator for personal gain instead.

42426053,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhzjh,1410278133,API Developer Gem Aims to Streamline Bitcoin App Development,"Bitcoin startup Gem has launched a private beta of what it says is a highly scalable and security-focused API for bitcoin app developers.  The Gem API was designed from the ground up to streamline app development while delivering enhanced levels of security by encrypting and backing up bitcoin storage and building in technologies such as multi-signature authentication.  The platform was showcased and launched at the ongoing TechCrunch Disrupt San Francisco.  Encrypted data  Gem  chief executive Micah Winkelspecht said the platform offers an extra layer of security compared to competing solutions.  Gem does not hold actual bitcoins. Instead, it stores encrypted files that can only be accessed using a private key (or multiple keys in a multi-signature setup), creating a framework that the startup states is capable of eliminating single points of failure. Should a hacker gain access to the servers, they would gain nothing without the private keys.  Developers opting to use the Gem API would not need to store bitcoins on their own hardware. Instead, they could simply hand out keys to their users, removing the need to maintain – and secure – a centralized storage server.  Battlefield showdown  The API also lowers the threshold for bitcoin developers who choose to use the API, as they can build apps without having deal with complex technical aspects themselves.  “Right now, if you want to build a bitcoin app, you have to be an expert in cryptography and security. We give you a very consumable platform and a client library,” Winkelspecht told TechCrunch.  Gem claims the API can be used to build digital currency apps in a matter of minutes, with a few lines of code, thus allowing developers to focus more time on the app itself rather than the underlying infrastructure.  Winkelspecht and his team demonstrated the API at the TechCrunch Battlefield competition, developing “one of the best” Android wallets on the market in a matter of weeks, he said.  Free version likely  Regarding pricing, Winkelspecht said the company has not finalized its strategy yet, but that a free version of the API will be available for small developers. Big bitcoin companies will have to pay for the service and pricing will depend on the level of usage.  Gem is based in California and managed to secure $2m in a seed funding round earlier this year. The firm indicated it is already in talks with third-party developers about its API and plans to become an all-in-one platform for bitcoin apps.  Startup Chain is also developing an API to take the hard work out of bitcoin app development and has raised $13.7m in funding so far.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/09/09/api-developer-gem-aims-to-streamline-bitcoin-app-development,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ee74a34d35705199f8ca6e4e98971e6658990666-2560x1996.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42426050,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhzbh,1410274227,BTChip Launches Multi-Signature USB Bitcoin Wallet,"UPDATE (22nd December 13:35 GMT): BTChip has now merged with Ledger.  BTChip and GreenAddress have teamed up to launch a USB bitcoin hardware wallet designed to offer multi-signature security on a budget.  Named HW.1, the smartcard-based USB wallet was created by BTChip with security and user experience in mind. The device features multi-signature functionality provided by bitcoin wallet GreenAddress.  BTChip founder Nicolas Bacca said the device should appeal to users frustrated with the bitcoin wallets' current security policies, saying:  “We’re pleased to be the first company to bring affordable banking grade security, while preserving bitcoin user-centred principles. And, with GreenAddress, you are protected by both the card and by the multisig provided by the wallet. It makes it very, very easy for you to access your coins.”  Bacca argued that the multisig feature enhances the user experience, as transactions are made easier, safer and faster and that the use of two-factor authentication offers a second layer of security.  USB and USB on-the-go functionality  The HW.1 can be used on standard USB ports through a Chrome app running on Windows, Mac OS X, Android or Linux. It can also be used on Android devices with USB on-the-go (OTG) functionality, including a wide range of smartphones and tablets.  Lawrence Nahum, co-founder and chief executive of GreenAddress explained:  “A combination that brings the best of two worlds: multisig and hardware wallets. I expect a lot of people to be using them. Both our Chrome app and Android app support the HW.1 with the latter in final testing and via full USB ports or micro USB OTG adapters.”  Nahum says USB OTG functionality has been tested on several popular devices, including the Samsung Galaxy S5, S3, Google/LG Nexus 5 and even the old Nexus S. The app requires Android 4.x.x to run.  Security  Nahum described GreenAddress as one of the most promising and innovative bitcoin wallet platforms, with support for multisig and HD (BIP32) features. The HW.1 is based on an open-source API available on GitHub and it is compatible with Electrum 2.0.  Nahum told CoinDesk that the recently publicised BadUSB vulnerability, an exploit that turns USB-connected devices to highly programmable attack platforms, does not affect the HW.1 wallet.  The wallet is intended to be used even in situations in which the user doesn't trust the computer being used to transact, as it handles man-in-the-middle attacks, Nahum explained. In the case that it's used in conjunction with GreenAddress, the user may receive an email or SMS with a two-factor authentication code.  When the HW.1 device is used with the Electrum wallet, users can verify transactions on a separate computer before making signatures, thereby making it more user friendly with GreenAddress, Nahum continued.  He said:  ""It means people still have to backup once they wallet details but then don't need to remember long mnemonic passphrases. They can bring their wallet with them at all times as it fits a legacy wallet.""  The HW.1 wallet is priced at €20 with standard shipping, while registered shipping will cost €10 extra. The company also has a time limited launch offer, whereby early adopters can get two wallets for the price of one.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/09/09/btchip-launches-multi-signature-usb-bitcoin-wallet,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0a9fc1f3baf2a74329d85ff562be381e37eb3d22-1250x787.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42426062,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhzth,1410268627,Latin America's Latest Ripple Gateway Launches in Brazil,"A new Ripple Gateway launched in Brazil today, the country's second so far.  The company, which is called Rippex, will service Brazilian residents, giving them a fast and affordable way to buy digital currency in the country, according to its cofounder Rafael Olaio.  Olaio told CoinDesk there is an access barrier between bitcoin and its potential users:  “[Rippex] will improve the connection of Brazil and the cryptocurrency environment […] Today we pay a premium on the price of bitcoin, for example, because of the [forex] needed to send money abroad.”  He added that the country’s mining community isn’t large or active enough to create enough bitcoins to sustain the local economy and that having a Ripple gateway is necessary to give people access to certain assets that are difficult to acquire by other means.  Ripple users today can buy bitcoins, litecoins, dogecoins, and test the liquidity of the different markets. Olaio hopes this will help Brazilians to buy such digital assets at better prices.  As a new customer incentive, the company is giving away up to 2,000 XRP to newly registered and verified users, who will receive their first 400 XRP upon the first fiat deposit, and the remaining incrementally thereafter.  Access to other markets  It’s hard to get a picture of the Brazilian bitcoin market, Olaio said. There isn’t much objective data for it and the general impression is that arbitrage is the main driver of the bitcoin economy there.  He explained:  “The demand here is not very big right now for two reasons: the bitcoin economy here is not that big, and there’s always a premium on the price.”  Rippex’s model is to offer a platform for frictionless conversion between Brazilian reals (BRL) in banks and in the Ripple network. It will have strict control over its reserves to assure that each BRL in the Ripple network is backed by 1 BRL in the bank account, Olaio explained.  “This allows people from Brazil to have a venerable asset inside the Ripple network and to access all these credible markets,” Olaio said. “When the network grows and gets more mature, and liquidity is enough, they have enough features at their feet.”  He said the company keeps users’ assets in separate bank accounts from the corporate funds and, for transparency, intends to disclose the companies with which Rippex banks.  Leading the Latin American market  Rippex is the second Ripple gateway to enter the Brazilian market, following Ripple LatAm, which was launched by payments solutions provider AstroPay to service customers is seven markets, including Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru and Uruguay.  While Rippex is a Brazilian company focused on Brazilian customers, Olaio suggested that Brazil could perhaps “be an example of adaptation” for the Latin American region.  “I think that today Brazil can deal with this kind of animal and our inflationary scenario is not bad,” he said. “So bitcoin is not a threat to the national currency.”  Bitcoin regulation is unclear in Brazil, as everywhere in the region. Olaio’s guess is that Latin American countries will keep an eye on what happens in the developed regions of North America and Europe, but look to Brazil to adapt locally suitable versions of any new rules.

42426058,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhzrh,1410258870,FBI: No Illegal Techniques Used in Silk Road Investigation,"The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) released information on Friday detailing how it allegedly discovered Silk Road and linked Ross Ulbricht to the illicit website.  The 58-page filing, submitted to the US District Southern Court of New York, offers a lengthy rebuttal to recent assertions by Ulbricht. He claimed the methods used by federal officers during the investigation of Silk Road were unlawful and that, as such, the information recovered through this process should not be admissible in court.  Penned by FBI agent Christopher Tarbell, the document offered a four-point critique of the motion Ulbricht and his defense team first filed in August, though the overall tone was crafted as to suggest that the FBI is dismissive of any claims levelled against its work by Ulbricht.  Tarbell wrote:  ""[Ulbricht's] various claims are bereft of any support in the law. [...] Instead, they amount to a pointless fishing expedition aimed at vindicating his misguided conjecture about the NSA being the shadowy hand behind the government’s investigation.""  The filing goes on to suggest how the government was able to identify servers used to operate the Silk Road website, along with the various steps that federal officials took to connect this information to 'Dread Pirate Roberts', the alias allegedly used by Ulbricht to operate the website. It also argues all Ulbricht's claims that illegal evidence was used in the case should be dismissed.  Notably, the filing has not been without its critics, who allege inconsistencies with the government's official version of the events.  Lawful means  Central to the FBI's rebuttal was that agents noticed that the server's Internet protocol (IP) address was 'leaking' information from the Silk Road website due to an ""apparent misconfiguration of the user login interface by the site administrator"".  Exploiting this error, the FBI says, it was able to reveal certain IP addresses that were not protected by the Tor network, and could thus trace the addresses to physical locations.  Contrary to Ulbricht's claims, the US government argues it:  Did not need to release information about how it found the Silk Road website when it originally obtained its search warrant  Lawfully used PEN registers during the investigation to collect routing data, as they do not require a warrant  Was approved to search Ulbricht's email and Facebook for evidence of wrongdoing after establishing probable cause  Was not required to obtain a warrant to search the Silk Road server because the investigation was carried out by foreign authorities  Iceland's intervention  The FBI further addressed the role of Icelandic law enforcement officials in the investigation, who Ulbricht and his legal team have alleged were used strategically to bypass the Fourth Amendment protections Ulbricht is afforded as a US citizen.  Offering a rebuttal of this stance, the filing argues that US authorities approached their peers in Iceland because the Silk Road server was located in this jurisdiction.  However, the FBI also indicated that any search by Icelandic law enforcement officials would not involve Fourth Amendment requirements, as this right does not apply outside the US.  ""It is well established that the Fourth Amendment’s warrant requirement does not apply overseas – even to searches conducted directly by US law enforcement agents of property belonging to a US citizen,"" the filing reads.  Pen registers  The FBI went on to reject the notion that it used a surveillance technique known as a pen register to track Ulbricht's location. Rather, the filing suggests such tools were used to monitor Ulbricht's Internet activity, and that these logs were compared to records of the Dread Pirate Roberts' online activity to identify Ulbricht as the site's operator.  Still, the government moved broadly to reject the idea that Ulbricht had a right to privacy in this case at all given the need for law enforcement officials to take action against Silk Road.  The report stated:  ""In any event, whatever expectation of privacy Ulbricht did have in the SR server, it was plainly outweighed by the government’s legitimate need to search its contents. The government had ample evidence, easily enough to establish probable cause, that the SR server was hosting the Silk Road website.""  The filing added: ""Under the circumstances, searching the server was more than reasonable. It was a law enforcement imperative that would have been a gross dereliction of duty for the government not to pursue.""  Murder-for-hire allegations are relevant  Ross Ulbricht's defense was also handed another potential blow in the prosecution's insistence that the murder-for-hire allegations are relevant to the case.  The filing suggests the allegations provide valuable context for Ulbricht's state of mind at the time he was allegedly operating Silk Road, and as such, should be admissible in court.  Tarbell wrote:  ""The use of violence and threatened violence to protect one’s drug empire are relevant to proving the intentional operation of a narcotics conspiracy, and such conduct may be alleged as overt acts in furtherance of such a charge.""  Notably, Ulbricht was not indicted on murder-for-hire charges in New York, though one such charge was filed in a Maryland court.  Doubts cast on FBI explanation  Despite the strong and persuasive language evoked by the FBI, critics of the filing and the plausibility of the government's version of events have emerged.  For example, Australian blogger and hacker Nik Cubrilovic first detailed his criticism of the filing on 7th September, noting a series of issues with the reasoning listed in the report.  Cubrilovic alleged that while Tor configurations can leak information, the FBI cited an incorrect page in an attempt to bolster this claim. Further, he asserts the process detailed by the FBI is vague, adding that anybody with knowledge of Tor and hidden services would not be able to read or replicate the process FBI agents said they completed.  CAPTCHA concerns  Speaking to Wired, privacy researcher Runa Sandvik suggested the details regarding how the FBI allegedly exploited a Silk Road CAPTCHA page to establish the location of the Silk Road server were problematic.  Sandvik indicated she believes the CAPTCHA was hosted on the same server as Silk Road, meaning it would have been only accessible through the Tor network. Such a finding by the FBI, Sandvik reasons, would represent a flaw with Tor and not Silk Road's site architecture.  Cubrilovic came to a similar conclusion in his blog post, speculating that operators of the site would have likely noticed such an error. He told Wired:  “The way they’re trying to make a jury or a judge believe it happened just doesn’t make sense technically.”  The development marks the latest update in the ongoing prosecution of Ross Ulbricht. The trial is set to begin this November.  At press time, Ulbricht’s attorney Joshua Dratel told CoinDesk that they were still evaluating the newest case filing, and that a formal response would be forthcoming.

The exchange is offering prizes of funded trading accounts to the top 50 traders in the competition, which closes at 12:00 (Beijing time) on 19th September. The only catch is, winners must then turn those accounts into profits to pocket the winnings.  BitVC  COO Wang Huaiqiang explained the competition's purpose:  ""We tried to design BitVC Futures to be easy for beginners to understand and convenient for experienced traders. Playing the game is a good opportunity to learn the system, practice trading strategies, and win prizes. We are very interested to get user feedback from this competition.""  Trading 'virtual' bitcoins  Existing BitVC users may participate immediately, but new users must register at BitVC first. A regular account with parent company Huobi's exchange is not necessary.  At the start of the competition, users will receive 100 'virtual BTC' to trade in the simulated BitVC futures market.  The name, rank, and profit of the top 50 traders will be posted and updated daily. If two users have the same profit percentage at the end of the competition, whoever has the higher trading volume will take the upper place.  The long path to winnings  One first-prize winner will receive trading accounts worth 50 BTC, four second-prize winners will get 25 BTC each, 10 third-prizers will get 10 BTC each and 35 fourth-prize winners 1 BTC each.  Winning one of these prizes is similar to gaining a place in the World Cup finals: in effect, you haven't won yet. Next, the prize money must be used for trading for one month and winners need to demonstrate further trading talents to score the bitcoins.  At the end of that month, the principal prize amount is returned to BitVC and the winner pockets whatever profit they've made from trading.  If there is no profit, then no prize. Should an account fall to less than 80% of the prize principal during the month, the remainder goes back to BitVC and that user's participation in the finals ends – at least with BitVC's money.  For the full competition rules, see the company websitehttps://www.bitvc.com/topic/competition.  About the company  BitVC is the Hong Kong-registered subsidiary of Huobi, which is based in Beijing.  BitVC offers more exotic trading features like margin trading, interest-bearing 'Yubibao' wallets and now derivatives – a limited, fixed-term deposit offer based on a mining facility saw all subscriptions sold in the first hour when it went live last week.  While BitVC margin trades are executed on the Huobi main exchange via its API, BitVC Futures will have no direct connection other than Huobi's inclusion in the BTC-CNY price index.  Other features are expected to be announced in the coming weeks.

42426043,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhzPh,1410231325,"Hacker Hijacks Satoshi Nakamoto's Email, Threatens to Reveal All","The bitcoin world is abuzz with speculation that some of Satoshi Nakamoto's online accounts have been compromised, concerned a hacker could potentially access information concerning the bitcoin creator's true identity or use the accounts to defraud key members of the bitcoin community.  Wired reported that the alleged hacker had posted on Pastebin that they would reveal key details of Nakamoto's identity if 25 BTC were sent to a specified bitcoin address. While small donations have been coming in, the address still appears well short of that mark.  Administrator 'theymos' of the Bitcoin Talk forum (aka Michael Marquardt) a key figure in bitcoin's online community, posted just after 9pm (BST) on 8th September, alerting the community of the development, writing:  ""Today I received an email from satoshin@gmx.com (Satoshi's old email address), the contents of which make me almost certain that the email account is compromised. The email was not spoofed in any way. It seems very likely that either Satoshi's email account in particular or gmx.com in general was compromised, and the email account is now under the control of someone else. Perhaps satoshin@gmx.com expired and then someone else registered it.""  ""Everyone knows that Bitcoin runs on drama, so this should do wonders for the recent price slump!"" theymos added later.  Shortly after, another mysterious message appeared on the P2Pfoundation's 'ning' message board, as a reply to Nakamoto's original introduction to bitcoin. The post was sent from the Satoshi Nakamoto account, but appeared to warn him of what was happening:  ""Dear Satoshi. Your dox, passwords and IP addresses are being sold on the darknet. Apparently you didn't configure Tor properly and your IP leaked when you used your email account sometime in 2010. You are not safe. You need to get out of where you are as soon as possible before these people harm you. Thank you for inventing bitcoin.""  Bitcoin's source code page on SourceForge also redirected to anti-bitcoin troll site 'buttcoin’, although it was later returned to its original state (it would still be prudent to not download anything from that particular page, however).  Hacked or expired?  Many suggested the gmx.com address Nakamoto used had simply expired after a period of time and had been claimed by someone else.  However, bitcoin core developer Peter Todd wrote on Twitter roughly four hours after theymos' original post that whoever controlled the email address also appeared to have access to Nakamoto's email history, putting paid to the 'expired' theory.    Interesting, got another forwarded email from ""satoshi"", from 2011 - indicates this was a hijacked account, not expired and re-registered.      – Peter Todd (@petertoddbtc) 9 Sept 2014    Nakamoto, however, 'retired' from active participation in bitcoin in April 2011, and the hacker has not presented any evidence they have access to emails from before then.  Satoshi's identity and fortune  Satoshi Nakamoto's true identity is bitcoin's core enigma, not just because the creator of the world's most successful cryptocurrency experiment remains anonymous after nearly six years, but because bitcoin's rising price would make that person extremely wealthy.  Some analysts say Satoshi Nakamoto's bitcoin fortune could be as much as 1 million BTC, spread over a series of wallet address and the result of mining from bitcoin's earliest days. Bitcoin enthusiasts have monitored these addresses closely in the hope of uncovering clues – but so far none of the funds have been touched, adding to the mystery.  They remain untouched as of press time. Any movement of those original coins on the open market would likely have an impact on bitcoin's price.  CoinDesk will continue to monitor this developing story and add details as they come to hand.  image via Shutterstock",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/09/09/hacker-hijacks-satoshi-nakamotos-email-threatens-to-reveal-all,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/838cace76a1e5755c65f42725fe1183dc90bfcc1-1260x840.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
