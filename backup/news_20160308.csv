42426680,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJw2Dh,1457476658,Precious Metals Dealer JM Bullion Accepts Bitcoin,"Dallas-based precious metals dealer JM Bullion is now accepting bitcoin.  With the announcement, JM Bullion joins a growing list of US-based precious metals dealers that accept bitcoin for payments, including Agora Commodities and Amagi Metals.  JM Bullion will accept bitcoin through a partnership with merchant processing startup BitPay. Customers will receive 4% discounts on bitcoin purchases, an offer also extended to those who pay with bank transfers and paper checks.  Director of e-commerce Thomas Fougerousse said that he believes the decision enables the company to offer a better payment experience while reaching a new audience.  Fougerousse said:  ""Bitcoin is allowing us a new way to meet demand from dedicated precious metals buyers.""  The news comes at a time when bitcoin’s use case as a digital currency is being overshadowed by an emphasis on blockchain technology and declining merchant adoption metrics.  According to CoinDesk’s State of Bitcoin 2016 report, major merchant processors BitPay and Coinbase are no longer announcing the number of merchants enrolling in services, reporting no change in totals in Q4 2015.  Still, findings suggest the total number of merchants accepting the digital currency rose 42% year over year.

42426683,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJw2Hh,1457467506,Infosys: Blockchain Tech Adoption Won't Take A Decade,"IT consulting giant Infosys believes that estimates for how long it will take blockchain technology to achieve mainstream adoption are greatly exaggerated.  According to Infosys principal technology architect Peter Loop, work on blockchain applications will benefit from an accelerating pace of overall tech adoption that will soon put pressure on existing legacy financial solutions.  ""It’s not 10 years away. It’s years or less away. The way the pace of technology works, the way continuous integration works, these things will be integrated pretty quickly once it happens,"" Loop said in a new interview.  The comments come amid increased competition among major consulting and audit firms for market share in the blockchain space. In addition to Infosys, Deloitte, IBM, PwC and KPMG have all recently sought to position themselves in the developing market.  For its part, Loop said Infosys is now working with clients to build proofs-of-concept (PoCs) and identify business use cases.  Loop told CoinDesk:  ""We have a discussion group [on blockchain]... I think this is an area that is ripe for a lot of innovation.""  Elsewhere, Loop was optimistic about other use cases, including syndicated loans and supply chain, stating that they would ""allow for some interesting scenarios"".  Based in Bangalore, India, Infosys boasts 193,000 employees and $8.7bn in revenues, according to its 2014-2015 annual report. Loop said the company is focusing on blockchain amid a desire to both identify new product lines and improve existing offerings.  Of note is how Infosys could bolster offerings such as Finacle, a product for banking, payments and treasury that aims to reduce software spending at financial institutions by consolidating global services.  Both products, Loop said, are a key part of Infosys’s strategy, as is what he described as its expansive client base in financial services.  ""Infosys is not just a consulting group, we’re also a product group, so we are looking to productize what we’re doing. Infosys is in seven of the 10 top banks. Thirty-three percent of its revenue comes from financial services,"" he said.  Customer interest  Infosys is also seeing demand for blockchain services from clients who have heard the hype surrounding the technology, but whose understanding of the technology is somewhat limited.  ""We have a lot of banks coming to us, saying they want to be the first to do blockchain,"" Loop said, adding that Infosys believes the technology is best explored collaboratively among financial firms.  Loop said Infosys is seeing three types of customers: those who don’t believe blockchain will be disruptive; those who confuse blockchain with bitcoin and those who are “gung-ho” about investigating potential applications.  For its part, Loop said Infosys remains excited about the technology.  In particular, he cited recent market developments such as interest from the DTCC and Microsoft as positive market indicators.  ""How it ends up is going to be very interesting,"" Loop said. ""I think it’s going to be the Internet of value transmission.""  Killer apps  As of today, Loop said most Infosys clients are looking to ""dip their toes"" into the industry, testing out solutions such as blockchain-based document management, for example.  Loop said he sees this as a positive, a way for larger enterprises to start testing shared ledgers while identifying potential applications.  ""I get that conversation from people who are in the learning stage. It’s a good learning approach [to avoid taking on] the most risky thing,"" he said.  Still, Loop said that he believes the possible efficiencies clients are seeking should be the point of emphasis in conversations.  ""I think the purpose is not that blockchain wins but that efficiencies in the process win,"" Loop said.  Loop concluded:  ""Pretty soon you’ll have a killer app. But, I hope none of them think it’s a blockchain app, that it’s just a solution.""  Correction: A previous version of this article stated that Infosys earned 75% of its revenue from financial services.

The comments were issued by co-founder and CTO Nathan Blecharczyk in a recent interview in which he discussed the company's plans for 2016.  City AM writer Harriet Green said that the conversation eventually turned to blockchain tech, and that Blecharczyk suggested it could factor into the ways in which the service could enhance the trust mechanisms that enable its service.  He told the publication:  ""We're looking for all different kinds of signals to tell us whether someone is reputable, and I could certainly see some of these more novel types of signals being plugged into our engine.""  Airbnb currently uses a mixture of social media profiles and profile reviews, according to its website. Users also verify their government-issued ID cards through the service.

42426671,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJw23h,1457453114,Mizuho Trials Blockchain for Cross-Border Payments,"Japanese banking group Mizuho has completed a blockchain test focused on cross-border securities settlement.  The test used the Open Assets Protocol, a commonly deployed implementation of colored coins that provides an added layer of functionality to the bitcoin blockchain. Using Open Assets, bitcoins can be specially marked to represent other assets on the blockchain.  According to an 8th March press release, the test included the participation of Japanese IT giant Fujitsu, including its research and development arm Fujitsu Laboratories.  The participants said that the test, which took place between December and February, showed that post-trade processing times can be reduced using blockchain applications.  Mizuho said in a statement:  ""In the system, continuously generated blocks containing trade information were chronologically linked as blockchain, becoming information that could not be tampered. And, because the information could be shared between multiple companies, the partners confirmed that it was possible to shorten the time required in the post-trade process.""  Near-instant settlement  The trial's aim, Mizuho said, was to seek a method of facilitating the post-trade process that would both shorten the time involved as well as reduce the possibility of data tampering.  ""The goal was to enable low-cost, low-risk cross-border securities transactions by building a system utilizing blockchain technology that can almost instantly share matched trade information in the post-trade process as data that cannot be tampered with, but without building a large-scale settlement system from scratch,"" the bank said.  Mizuho said that it offered its ""expertise with the securities settlement process"" to the project, with Fujitsu developing the test system that was used. Fujitsu Laboratories managed the trial itself, according to the companies involved.  Mizuho and Fujitsu aren’t the only companies in the finance space looking at applying blockchain tech to potential solutions for post-trade settlement.  Last year, a group of firms involving the London Stock Exchange, Société Générale and UBS began work on exploring the technology for this purpose.  More work ahead  The companies involved said that they intend to use the data gleaned from the experiment to prepare for future efforts.  For Mizuho, the announcement adds to the growing body of blockchain tech work it is conducted. Last month, the bank disclosed that it was working with IT consulting firm Cognizant to develop an internal recordkeeping system using the technology.  Mizuho, which was an early banking interest in the space given its past work with now-defunct bitcoin exchange Mt Gox, is also involved with work on a syndicated loan system that uses blockchain applications.  That project sees Mizuho partnering with Information Services International-Dentsu (ISID), Microsoft Japan and blockchain startup Currency Port.  The bank is also one of more than 40 banking partners of the blockchain consortium led by startup R3.

42426686,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJw2Nh,1457450728,70% of Financial Institutions Believe Blockchain Will Be Good for Business,"Despite claims that blockchain could be a disruptive technology, a new survey has found 70% of financial institutions believe the innovation will positively impact their business.  Notably, this figure rose to 90% among financial institutions that reported a strong awareness of the technology, according to data from business advisory firm FTI Consulting. The findings came even as respondents suggested they also believe that blockchain technology could make it easier for criminals to finance illegal activities and sidestep regulations.  According to managing director Dan Healy, the survey was not the subject of a formal report, but rather a more informal process meant to help FTI learn more about the perception of blockchain technology among major financial firms. In total, the survey received more than 700 responses.  Healy told CoinDesk:  ""We did it primarily for our own information, to learn what financial institutions know or think of this. We hear a lot about the same FinTech companies eating the lunch of more traditional financial institutions and this was with that view.""  The findings show that while the majority of financial institutions (65%) reported they are aware of the technology, just 26% say they are knowledgeable about it.  Institutions were most likely to report a knowledge of blockchain in the UK (35%) and least likely to indicate an awareness in Australia (14%).  Elsewhere, 19% of financial institutions said they believe they are fully prepared for the impact blockchain technology could have on their business. However, his figure rose to 52% among institutions that reported a greater knowledge of the subject.

42426692,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJw2Xh,1457439004,"With New Releases, Competing Bitcoin Softwares Forge Long-Term Plans","Divisions in the ongoing block size debate grew more pronounced this week following a private conference and a spike in network activity that saw users waiting longer and paying more to have transactions confirmed.  The ongoing debate over how the bitcoin blockchain should be scaled to accommodate new users was reportedly a point of focus as the recent Satoshi Roundtable, an invite-only retreat that united developers and business leaders. However, signs suggest that attendees emerged from the event with a more negative view of the state of discourse.  But even as tensions linger, development on both two competing versions of the bitcoin software – Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin Core – is continuing as the groups lobby for support from the network's wider user base.  In late February, Bitcoin Core, the network's largest and longest-tenured group of developers, released a new roadmap, and along with it, the latest release – version 0.12.0 – of the software.  Soon after, the team behind the alternative bitcoin implementation Bitcoin Classic announced its 2016 roadmaphttps://github.com/bitcoinclassic/documentation/blob/master/roadmap/roadmap2016.md, and this week followed up with a release of the latest version of Classic, based on Core version 0.12.0.  The releases remain of interest to the community, as when it comes to a potential bitcoin fork, the result may be winner take all.  Leading technologists believe the group that is able to get consensus around their vision will quickly see their rule sets enacted, and that despite concerns, a risk of the network splitting into two incompatible versions of the blockchain remains low.  Bloq CEO Jeff Garzik told CoinDesk:  ""The network will rapidly follow the winning fork, [there are] billions in incentives.""  This article looks at the makeup of these two releases and how both groups are moving forward to implement their vision for the bitcoin network.  Classic roadmap  In its official 2016 roadmap, the development team responsible for Classic released the intended plan for rolling out software over the next 11 months.  During the first phase, the team expects to implement BIP 109, originally proposed for Core by developer Gavin Andresen, which would increase the size of transaction blocks on the bitcoin network from the current 1 megabyte (MB) per block to 2 MB per block.  The threshold for this transition would be when 751 of the previous 1,000 blocks were mined with the code supporting bigger blocks. Upon reaching that 75% threshold, a 28-day activation period would begin.  Andresen told CoinDesk:  ""The danger of a high threshold is a miner or pool operator may be coerced to exercise that veto – they might be threatened or blackmailed. This is not a theoretical risk. We do see denial-of-service attacks against pools or services 'voting the wrong way' and there have even been reports of death threats.""  The 28-day period has left some in the community concerned, but Andresen remarked in a recent blog post that ""several of the major bitcoin miners, exchanges, [and] web-wallet providers"" have indicated the activation period gives them ""plenty of time"" to change their software.  He further defended the 28-day grace period by comparing it to the last block version upgrade.  Andresen explained that it took approximately a month to reach 75% of the hashrate and once that happened, it only took a further seven days to reach 95% of the hashrate.  In other words, he believes there doesn’t appear to be significant concern regarding a 28-day transition window.  Future phases for Classic  In the event that the hard fork does commence, Classic will enter its second phase during Q2 or Q3 2016 with the intended goal of addressing block size concerns.  ""The goal of phase two is to eliminate the technical barriers (due to an inefficient network protocol) that limit the capacity of the network. Instead of transmitting a huge burst of data when a new block is found, a tiny amount of data will be broadcast, referencing transaction data that must have already been broadcast,"" Andresen explained.  He went on to state that these efficiencies are not a concern at 1 MB or 2 MB blocks, but that the ultimate goal of phase two was to ""stop central decision-making about the 'right' maximum size and get back to Satoshi’s original vision of a self-regulating system"".  The final step for the Classic team is to introduce a dynamic block size limit, but only after ""miners and companies confirm phase two successfully addressed their block size concerns.""  One proposal presented in the roadmap is to use a variation of the adaptive block size based on recent median block size outlined in a recent blog post by Stephen Pair, CEO of BitPay.  ""To determine the block size limit, you compute the median block size over some recent sample of blocks and apply a multiple,"" Pair wrote.  Pair goes on to explain that, unlike the average block size, median is much harder to game. With an average block size, miners could inflate the block size with their own transactions or, on the other hand, put no transactions into blocks. With median, ""you would need coordinated action by more than 50% of the mining capacity"".  Of course, if someone controlled more than 50% of the mining capacity, bitcoin has bigger issues to contend with than the block size limit.  Along with an increase to the block size, Classic is planning to hold a conference ""where these and future scaling solutions & concerns can be discussed among the community"".  The new release, published on 7th March, incorporates elements from Bitcoin Core's 0.12.0 but notably leaves the opt-in replace-by-fee (RBF) feature, with which users can rebroadcast transactions with higher fees so long as they haven't been included in a block, set to disabled by default.  Core releases latest software version  The Core development team announced the release of v0.12.0 on 23rd February, which the developers described as potentially being ""the biggest one yet, with more significant improvements than any other before"".  The team framed the release as being focused on optimizing overall software performance. In many instances, it was meant to reduce needed computational resources or improve the speed at which actions can take place.  In November 2015, Core developer Pieter Wuille submitted a pull request to switch to a libsecp256k1-based ECDSA validation. In it, he explained that there would be three benefits to making that transition.  ""Signature validation is anywhere between 2.5 and 5.5 times faster; Consensus code no longer depends on OpenSSL or its signature parser; Removes linking with OpenSSL from libconsensus,"" he wrote.  There were also security implications to switching away from OpenSSL.  ""OpenSSL is very comprehensive in its capabilities, but this enormous feature set means that its attack surface is fairly large as a result,"" the team wrote in its v.0.12.0 announcement.  After spending nearly three years in development, libsecp256k1 has been merged with the Bitcoin Core client, resulting in what the team says is a seven-times improvement in signature validation speed. Further, because libsecp256k1 is focused primarily on signature validation, the area for security exploits is much smaller, according to Core.  Continuing with its optimization, the team also rolled out a mechanism to prevent node crashes due to memory pool limits.  Another key change has to do with how nodes store transactions that haven’t yet made it into a new block.  In a blog post published before he left the Bitcoin Core team, developer Mike Hearn warned about the potential for a significant decrease in network nodes.  As transactions are made, they enter into the memory pool where they are held until they show on the blockchain. As more transactions occur, more are forced into the memory pool. For nodes that have a lot of memory, this isn’t an issue; however, those that are operating with minimal amounts of memory face a potentially bad situation.  Hearn outlined three possible scenarios that could from this circumstance:  ""The node might become incredibly slow as it enters swap hell; the node might crash when it tries to allocate memory and fails; the node might be killed by the operating system kernel.""  To counteract this, Core introduced a feature called memory pool limiting, which sets a default hard limit on the size of the memory pool; specifically, it is set to 300 MB in 0.12.0.  What effectively happens is that, as a node starts picking up more transactions, if the memory pool hits that 300 MB limit, the node will first drop transactions that offer the lowest fee per bye rather than simply accepting more transactions.  Cutting resource costs  0.12.0 also introduces an upload traffic limiting factor. With nodes constantly relaying transactions around the network, it can result in increased amount of upload resources, putting a burden on individual nodes.  An upload traffic limiting factor allows for the operator to limit how much data is uploaded and shared with the rest of the bitcoin network. In the event that it hits this limit, the node will serve the blocks that were requested within the past week, thus minimizing resource needs.  To further prevent nodes from being overwhelmed, the team introduced wallet pruning.  Presently, nodes store a complete copy of the blockchain. As of writing this article, that means each node needs to store 57.8 GB of transaction data. The larger this gets, the more storage space is needed.  The new 'pruned mode' allows those that use the Bitcoin Core wallet to cut back on the required disk space from 60 GB to only 2 GB.  ""This means that the node will only focus on keeping track of unspent outputs and will forget previously-processed blocks as well as outputs that have been spent,"" the team explained.  While there was controversy with the inclusion of replace-by-fee, fundamentally, the new release focused on making it less resource-intensive for nodes to operate.  As the number of nodes has dipped down over the past few years, reducing the necessary resources should result in more users opting to run nodes that fully validate the blockchain. The more nodes in the network, the safer bitcoin becomes.
