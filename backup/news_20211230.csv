In the first part of this article, we talked about the many benefits we saw during 2021, but like in any innovation, there are worries about what it might all mean in the future. Related Reading | What DAOs Can Do: Social Movement Or Playground? Rethinking 2021 - Pt. I Worries Of The Year One of the worries that popped out in 2021 was taxes: are DAOs being responsible enough to educate their members on the taxes they will likely be subject of? If not, 2022 might bring very unpleasant surprises to them. The taxation of DAOs in the U.S. is an unclear landscape at the moment, and that can turn into dangerous scenarios for small investors. There are big concerns about thousands of dollars accumulated in tax liabilities, plus a dangerous grey area on legality. Reportedly, many users didn&apos;t know their tokens were taxable when they got them from DAOs during 2021. What happens if the token&apos;s price plunges dramatically? Members could still have to pay taxes based on the fair market value at the time they received it.

Here’s what’s happening:  Market moves: Bitcoin recovered some losses, charts turned short-term bullish.  Technician’s take (Editor’s note): Technician’s Take is taking a holiday hiatus. In its place, First Mover Asia is publishing a Nov. 12 column by CoinDesk Chief Content Officer Michael Casey on how crypto could play a larger role as a means of exchange.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $47,201 -0.8%  Ether (ETH): $3,722 -0.18  Markets  S&P 500: 4,778 -0.30%  DJIA: 36,398 -0.25%  Nasdaq: 15,741 -0.16%  Gold: $1,814 +0.56%  Market moves  Bitcoin remained near $47,000 on another day of low volume spot trading. Technical analysis supports a “buy” signal after bitcoin logged three straight days of losses this week.  The No. 1 cryptocurrency by market capitalization recovered some loss during U.S. trading hours on Thursday, after it dropped to below $46,000 a day ago. The spot trading volume across centralized exchanges remained low, down from a day ago, according to data compiled by CoinDesk.  While bitcoin is still down by more than 6% in the past seven days, according to Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, charts are showing bullish signals for the world’s oldest cryptocurrency.  “Bitcoin has a new short-term counter-trend “buy” signal today per Tom DeMark’s TD Sequential model,” Stockton wrote in a technical analysis dated Thursday. “The signal supports a two-week-plus rebound, although it is low-conviction because the daily stochastics are not affirming short-term oversold conditions.  Column  How Crypto Becomes Money:A new theory for a universal digital barter system. (By CoinDesk Chief Content Officer Michael Casey)  By soaring 4.4% to new record highs Wednesday after the release of a report that showed U.S. inflation hit its highest level in 31 years and then losing all of that in the day, bitcoin played straight into the hands of mainstream economists who pooh-pooh its potential as a currency.  Such volatile moves, they will argue, make it impossible for cryptocurrencies to serve what traditional economics describes as the three functions of money: i) a medium of exchange, ii) a store of value, and iii) a unit of account. A currency cannot play those roles, the argument goes, if its value is moving around so much without any predictability.  That sounds almost irrefutable, right? But what if the three functions framework is based on a flawed, or overly narrow, definition of money?  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  In “Money: The Unauthorized Biography,” Felix Martin argues that through history people have tended to wrongly think about money as a “thing” (such as a banknote or a chunk of a precious metal such as gold) and not for it what it is: a socially invented governance system for tracking transfers of property and clearing debt in a commonly trusted manner. By viewing money as something to be owned and accumulated, we’ve fetishized currencies rather than treating them as a means to an end.  In Martin’s construction, a country’s or an economy’s universally accepted currency is the thing. It is not the money. The currency is merely a tool that makes it easier to carry out the extremely difficult task of recording, counting and valuing transactions across a community of otherwise untrusting strangers.  In this way, cash can be viewed as a decentralized, peer-to-peer record-keeping device – as if by me giving you $10, my anonymous account in the dollar economy is debited by that amount and yours is credited. If you deposit those funds into a bank, you move the account into a different accounting system, but it’s ultimately serving the same function.  Over the centuries, this national currency-based money model became dominant, as sovereign states shaped it into a system of social organization and control. Whether it was fiat currency or gold-backed currency, the state set the rules and provided the foundation of trust – with varying degrees of success – by which people would use these record-keeping devices. But that is not the only way to think of how money could be organized.  Now, a new breed of open, censorship-resistant, geography-agnostic value transfer systems has emerged. Cryptocurrencies and their underlying blockchain protocols can provide rules and a framework of trust for users without needing to draw their authority from governments, even if their users remain bound by the laws of their home countries.  Many cryptocurrency proponents, filled with the same “focus-on-the-thing” instinct, tend to think of bitcoin replacing the dollar or at least providing a parallel alternative. But it’s possible to see a pathway where blockchains and digital assets (a much better descriptor of the tokens for these purposes than “cryptocurrencies”) do away with the need for universal common currencies altogether.  We have a long way to go, but if interoperability protocols and transaction processing can be scaled in a properly decentralized manner, such that buyers and sellers of digital assets can conduct cross-chain atomic swaps en masse without having to trust intermediaries, something akin to a global system of fractionalized digital value exchange is conceivable.  Need a car? You can buy it, not with dollars, but with a portion of another piece of property such as your small stake in that Beeple non-fungible token. Ironically, this vision seems like a new, digital version of an otherwise archaic value exchange system: barter. In this way, using the power to fractionalize digital ownership to any size imaginable addresses at least part of the “coincidence of wants” problem that made that system inefficient for civilizations.  Now, I can already hear traditional economists scoffing. What are you going to denominate those exchanges in? We need a common currency to overcome the impossible task of finding a real-time, fair price value for each asset across a gargantuan number of categories.  And, sure, to avoid using, say, a single currency as the reference price, we would need to build something unfathomably complex. We would need a universally accessible, open pricing platform that takes in data from a global network of price oracles tied to quadrillions of verifiably trusted devices deployed in every corner of the world. Based on a classification system for a massive variety of assets, it would constantly make available an almost infinite number of ever-changing cross-reference values in each asset relative to any of all the other assets. It’s kind of impossible, or at least it is until we get we’re on the verge of the singularity.  But we don’t need to achieve such an all-encompassing state to start to break down the dominance of national currencies. The dollar could remain as the world’s reference price, for example, but there would be no need for people to obtain it in a transaction. In effect, we could strip dominant currencies of their medium of exchange and store-of-value functions while maintaining their unit of account role.  Already, central banks in Singapore and the United Arab Emirates are exploring interoperability solutions for their central bank digital currency that would do just that. The implications for the dollar’s investable status as the world’s reserve currency are profound.  And if we reduce our imagination to a scenario many sizes smaller than the universal digital barter system discussed above, the prospects for fragmented areas of in-kind exchange that either bypass existing currencies or use them as reference prices are much greater.  Think of how ether, viewed by many not as currency but as a crypto commodity that powers the Ethereum network, is already widely used as the medium of exchange for buying and selling NFTs. And, of course, for all the “bitcoin cannot be a currency” dismissiveness, it has long functioned, along with ether, as a fundraising vehicle for token sales.  In those situations, the dollar is still lurking in the background as either the explicit or implicit reference price.  Also, the more this goes on, the more people start to “think” in bitcoin, ether or some other digital asset. There are plenty of bitcoiners who like to remind everyone that, whatever its price versus the dollar, one bitcoin continues to be worth one bitcoin. Many believe bitcoin, with its censorship-resistant, persistent supply mechanism, could evolve to become the base layer collateral for the global financial system, taking on a role akin to Treasury bonds.  Whether, in this coming world, the dollar fully disappears from the picture or remains a reference price, the expansion of a crypto system implies it could eventually be a universal unit of account. With a claim to the other two supposed functions of money – a medium of exchange and a store of value – will the dollar cease to be money?  The answer is that the dollar – the “thing” – never was money. It was an element of money, one piece – albeit a dominant piece – of society’s system for tracking property transfers and clearing debts. In the future, the dollar’s role in that system could be diminished, while the role of bitcoin, ether, NFTs and other digital assets could increase. None of them will be money as we used to think about it.  Important events  New Year’s Eve!

42393987,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bsQd9v,1640904627,Sushi Tries to Pick Up the Pieces: A DeFi Governance Case Study,"After months of public infighting and turmoil, popular decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Sushi has cleared the first stage of community voting for an ambitious governance overhaul designed to streamline internal processes with a hierarchical, departmental structure.  The proposal appears to conclude the latest chapter in a remarkably turbulent story about the protocol’s fall, rise and fall again – a case study for the oncoming and so far largely ebullient era of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and their unique governance structures.  Over the past two months, Sushi has been marred by internecine spats, accusations of corruption in governance forums and opaque processes – a saga reminiscent of the project’s chaotic early days, when pseudonymous founder “Chef Nomi” nearly ended the fledgling experiment by seizing and subsequently returning a multimillion-dollar development fund.  Read more: ‘I F**ked Up’: SushiSwap Creator Chef Nomi Returns $14M Dev Fund  The turmoil has pushed the price of Sushi’s governance token, SUSHI, down as far as 78% off its all-time high of $23.28 that was reached in March. Uniswap’s UNI, meanwhile – the ostensibly centralized and venture capital-funded project SushiSwap was meant to act as an alternative to – is down just 30% over the same period.  The stumbles have likewise turned the project into a popular punching bag for decentralized governance skeptics who argue that Sushi’s failure to effectively manage internal strife highlights the limitations of DAOs in running competitive businesses.  In spite of the rancor, however, with $5.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), SushiSwap remains a jewel as a top-15 DeFi protocol.  Even after the exodus, according to core contributor Rachel Chu, there remains 22 full-time contributors and another 40 frequent contributors in the Sushi Factory grants program. A major upgrade to the core decentralized exchange product, Trident, is estimated to launch in January, despite recent delays.  In short, there are multiple reasons to believe that the protocol can turn its fortunes around – perhaps chief among them being that yet another comeback story could be tremendously lucrative for token holders.  State of play  Interestingly, SushiSwap’s overhaul may provide the first substantive example of activist investors swarming the virtual boardroom that is DeFi governance.  The bulk of the operations overhaul proposal comes from a pair of investors: Alex Woodard of investment management firm Arca and Dean Eigenmann of investment firm Dialectic, with additional input from Daniele Sesta, the prolific developer behind the Magic Internet Money and Wonderland cryptocurrencies, among other contributors.  Read more: Sushi Jumps 10% After Top Avalanche Developer Proposes Takeover  On Wednesday, the proposal passed a “signal” vote with over 88% approval, paving the way for an overhaul of Sushi’s leadership and organizational structure following a definitive final vote next week.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Chu said that the overhaul’s success has lifted team spirits.  “Core team-wise, we’re very optimistic because of the overwhelming support from the industry,” she said. “But the other aspect of this challenge is to understand where we are, how we got here and how to get back on track – that’s something we still have to do.”  In an interview with a half-dozen current and former protocol contributors, investors and community members, CoinDesk attempted to do the same: tracking how Sushi went from an inefficient DAO to a fledgling business operation, only to backslide into organizational chaos once more – a story that reveals the pitfalls of trying to maintain transparency in a decentralized governance structure while effectively managing and running the operational aspects of an ever-evolving project.  Finances  One key pain point for the organization was a failure to establish more orderly financial and accounting practices as the DAO grew.  In September 2020, just weeks after Chef Nomi absconded with the developer fund (only to later return it), the DAO was in a rudimentary state. Elections were held to establish a multisig of DeFi community members, such as Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of crypto exchange FTX, to manage the treasury and push the project forward, as well as a proposal to hire former community manager 0xMaki to lead the project. However, that structure meant that the team needed approval from a majority of the multisig for any form of discretionary spending.  According to pseudonymous former contributor LevX, that situation led to the creation of a second multisig consisting of more readily available signers who worked primarily on Sushi.  “Whenever we needed money last year, we needed to persuade five people who were super busy, so Maki decided to create the ops multisig so we could transfer funds from the main treasury to ops multisig to use it quickly and efficiently,” he said.  LevX told CoinDesk that at first four people managed the new operations wallet with a budget of 200,000 SUSHI (over $500,000 at the time) per month, but there were constantly new employees joining and the criteria for who was on-boarded as an ops signer was opaque. Despite having left the core team in June, he is unsure if he is still one of them.  “It wasn’t handled professionally. It was pretty ad hoc,” he said.  The team never hired an accountant or treasurer, and an effort to institute an “inverted pyramid” system of communication – where decisions were discussed internally among team leadership, then the wider team, then with the community – quickly led to internal tensions, as many felt not all financial processes were sufficiently transparent.  “I think transparency is key to all things in crypto, especially DeFi,” LevX told CoinDesk.  BitDAO troubles  One instance where financial dealings led to tensions was the BitDAO deal.  In August 2021, Sushi’s Miso auction platform hosted the BitDAO public token launch, selling 12,767 ETH to create an initial BIT-ETH liquidity pool. Landing BitDAO, a decentralized hedge fund backed by the likes of PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel and the Bybit crypto exchange, was a major win for the Miso platform.  However, the team eventually realized that hosting such auctions could lead to regulatory scrutiny. The misstep was among the key motivating factors in asking Maki, who led the project through the Chef Nomi saga, to step down. While the transition was initially reported as Maki’s decision, multiple sources confirmed to CoinDesk that the choice to remove him came internally.  Read more: Sushi Core Contributor 0xMaki Transitioning to Advisory Role  “The development team voted 11–6 for off-boarding and we approached Maki,” said one former contributor who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “We asked him to take an advisory role, which was a sincere offer that he accepted consensually. We also offered that he keep his [SUSHI vesting schedule] as he was a catalyzing force in saving Sushi early on.”  Because of the regulatory concerns, the Miso platform also couldn’t charge a fee for the auction. Sushi’s legal team, however, advised that contributors could receive an allocation of BitDAO tokens directly for “services rendered.”  That grant allocation was distributed disproportionately among the team, with most team members receiving 88,000 BIT tokens and five contributors receiving 300,000 tokens. The team members who received larger bonuses have since returned the tokens.  While one former contributor argued that “personnel working directly on a project and/or leadership will see an outsized bonus based on their performance,” both the circumstances around Maki’s exit and the bonuses ultimately led LevX to launch a broader campaign against core team members in the name of transparency.  Crusade  LevX’s exact goals and strategies appear at times to be contradictory. One of his initial steps was gathering allies, including current head of engineering, Matthew Lilley; semi-anonymous core contributor Amanda; and pseudonymous core contributor AG. Lilley didn’t respond to a request to interview.  “Matt, me, Amanda and some others tried to dig into what was really happening, why they were trying to hide the deal. We asked multiple times and there was no clear answer, but they thought it was cyberbullying or something,” LevX told CoinDesk of his efforts.  Indeed, the effort appears at times to have been obsessive. CoinDesk reviewed chat transcripts from a group named “JORK’s dirty secrets” – an acronym for former Chief Technology Officer Joseph Delong, pseudonymous core contributor Omakase, Rachel Chu and pseudonymous core contributor Keno. There, LevX and others gossiped about recent hires and evaluated their colleagues based on loyalty to the project’s leadership.  One chat log provided to CoinDesk by LevX also gives a glimpse into how his demands manifested in team channels. What starts as a discussion about compensating Omakase, who lost a significant portion of his Sushi team allocation in the most recent CREAM hack, quickly devolved into a re-litigation of the BitDAO deal and Maki’s exit.  In a tweet, former CTO Delong compared the constant second-guessing and backbiting as a form of sabotage:  In a post on a Discord channel for one of his many side projects, LevX seems to acknowledge that his campaign was undermining Sushi’s performance. “I have been fighting with corrupt sushi members from October, almost every day,” LevX wrote, adding: “some of you hate me because the sushi price dropped.”  LevX told CoinDesk that his efforts were “always for the Sushi community” and all he wanted to accomplish was greater transparency.  “If Sushi is being corrupted, someone needs to speak up. As far as I experienced, there’s not a lot of people who thought it was wrong – they wanted to hide it. They didn’t want to share the information with the rest of the team,” he said.  ‘Iron rice bowl’  Multiple current and former contributors argued that LevX’s paeans to transparency ring hollow, however.  In particular, they point to a relationship between LevX and Amanda, who are now married, a relationship that went undisclosed for months.  Multiple contributors told CoinDesk that the LevX was integral in pushing for Amanda’s initial hiring despite a lack of qualifications. Additionally, LevX used funds from a grant awarded to develop Shoyu, a SushiSwap-funded NFT (non-fungible token) platform that Amanda worked on as a product manager, to attract investors to a DAO side project.  When asked about these allegations in a series of follow-up questions, LevX denied the claims, saying those events “never happened,” and in a tweet referred to the allegations as “fake news.”  CoinDesk reviewed chat transcripts between LevX and Omakase where LevX pushes his colleague to support Amanda’s hiring without disclosing their relationship, and a recent blog post promotes that LevX’s side project, the LevX DAO, would use a portion of his Shoyu salary to distribute ETH rewards to token holders.  Regardless of whatever degree LevX and Amanda materially profited from their undisclosed relationship, current and former contributors also say it created toxic workplace dynamics.  “These kinds of benign interactions add up to a disturbing interaction. Knowing that two colleagues have been married and passing every piece of information you gave them. I think this would be an odd interaction even if they were not a destructive force,” said one former contributor. “I can’t imagine working with my spouse for months and not letting my co-workers know.”  Omakase expressed frustration that the two claimed to be pushing for a flat, transparent hierarchy while also coordinating behind the scenes, adding that it was “unhealthy” for a family’s income to rely entirely on one source. He likened the dynamic to two people attempting to protect their “iron rice bowl,” a popular Chinese euphemism for job security.  “It’s absolutely normal and necessary for relevant personal relationships to be disclosed in normal organizational settings primarily due to concerns of nepotism. The lack of disclosure has a few very clear implications regarding conflicts of interests,” he said.  Human resources  Normally, a project could simply get rid of troublesome employees. However, where team leadership had previously claimed such authority, that power eroded after the BitDAO deal .  Early employees, such as LevX and Omakase, had to post governance forum proposals for the token holder community to approve their hiring. Once Maki took the reins, hiring and firing became an internal process, but there was never a governance proposal that explicitly granted any party that authority, and after Maki left, the organization “descended into a flat hierarchy,” as Chu put it.  “We descended into this interesting state where we had to vote – a democratic vote – on whether to offboard people. No organization has that – they have human resources, performance reviews. But these people said, ‘We want the best for the community,’” said Chu.  LevX admitted that much of the tension was a result of personal animosity between himself and Delong, who attempted to maintain hierarchy in the wake of Maki’s departure.  “[Delong] wanted to make Sushi a traditional company. Which isn’t bad, but in his own way, he started mixing it with the previous Sushi style,” said LevX.  Multiple contributors report that this period was marked with growing infighting, name calling, cyberbullying and unprofessionalism from various parties.  Processes aside from hiring and firing also grew contentious. Various team members called for internal votes on basic decisions and procedures, despite the outcomes of votes routinely being ignored: Information about the BitDAO deal was leaked to the media in spite of a vote against it, for instance.  “We had no ability to block or avoid these malicious acts,” Chu said.  Leaks became prevalent, even as efforts were made to weed out the leakers: Eventually, one of LevX’s allies in AG was fired by team vote, and she has since been identified as the primary party responsible for a leak of chat transcripts that led to a major exposé in hack-focused publication Rekt last month.  “Dissent usually attempts to expand the available audience – we’re seeing various public narratives, mostly false, as a result,” Omakase said of the dynamic. “Ultimately, though, there needs to be a maximum level of escalation or every disagreement escalates to public domains.”  “I think the bifurcation in the team was between contributors who wanted a traditional hierarchy and contributors who wanted some idealist collectivism. The collectivists won in the sense that they essentially destroyed an amazing team,” said one former contributor.  Restructure proposal  The exodus of talent may be only a temporary victory for those in favor of a flat hierarchy, however.  The unified restructure proposal that passed an initial vote yesterday borrows heavily from the corporate governance structure, with multiple discrete departments, department heads, levels of authority and hierarchy – and guidelines for orderly internal and external review processes.  “Structurelessness or flat hierarchies are dangerous especially in anon and remote teams because it lacks clear checks and balances as well as accountability,” said Dailectic’s Eigenmann of the proposal. “I think this hierarchy can resolve that issue.  “We think that cleaning up the DAO structure will be a way to accelerate SushiSwap to the next stage. We’ve worked closely together with the core team and investors to get this over the finish line,” he added.  Even with the new structure, the internal tensions that eventually exploded in public appear as if they may linger.  In a Twitter thread earlier in the month, LevX announced he was stepping away from Shoyu, citing mental stress and suicidal thoughts, and Delong likewise stepped away last month. However, members of the various factions that butted heads still remain on staff, and it remains to be seen how they will collaborate following the restructuring.  Omakase in particular remains a frequent target for trolling in Sushi’s governance forums, particularly from self-professed members of the LevX DAO. Omakase notes, however, that for all the noise, those calling for him to be fired have little actual power: Despite LevX being one of the largest recipients of sushi from his hiring proposal, he sold the majority and possesses few tokens with which to weigh in.  The restructuring proposal includes Omakase’s appointment as head of operations and business development and passed with over 88% of the voting weight. The architects of the restructure “know who are the good actors and who are the bad actors,” Chu added.  Additionally, Chu said that the team is rallying behind the new vision.  The “core team has really unified the past few days,” she said. “We’ve had really productive all-hands meetings where we come together and discuss that anything needs to be put past us, and we want to look to the future.”  Moving forward  Internally, the team has been working through the sometimes painful process of acknowledging mistakes and taking stock of how the protocol and its communications “descended into chaos,” as Chu put it.  “Sushi is at an inflection point where we need to be able to cross this minimum viable threshold where we can scale, do it transparently and productively, while also maintaining autonomy,” Chu said.  One current contributor who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that many of the tensions, battles and disagreements simply boil down to Sushi ending its “honeymoon period” – one where everyone made money and everyone had an incentive to maintain their vision of the status quo.  “Let’s be clear, there’s a lot of accumulated social capital from a protocol emitting $500 million in rewards. Is this sustainable? Clearly not. The hard work is and will continue to be collectively optimizing protocols and surrounding processes for growth once this honeymoon period is over,” the contributor said.  During the course of reporting for this story, multiple DeFi founders and personalities expressed hope that SushiSwap could weather the turbulence and emerge successful, saying the project’s genesis represents particular DeFi ideals.  “Sushi is one of the only community-run projects. If Sushi has fallen from the stage, it’s a slap in the face of decentralization,” Chu added.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | ZRX,Andrew Thurman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/12/30/sushi-tries-to-pick-up-the-pieces-a-defi-governance-case-study,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/28afb528b090fc803882cb1480558334198cdb5c-2048x1151.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42375647,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw9Xph,1640902050,"After Identity Theft, Salvadorans Now Report Funds Disappearing From Chivo Wallets","In the last few weeks, dozens of Salvadorans have reported on social media that money has disappeared from their Chivo wallets, the digital application developed by the Salvadoran government for the use of bitcoin throughout the country.  The reports come after hundreds of Salvadorans complained in October that hackers had illegally activated wallets associated with the nine-digit numbers on their identity cards – known as DUI for its acronym in Spanish – to claim the $30 bitcoin incentive dangled by El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele.  Luis Guardado, a Salvadoran who has lived in the United States for 30 years, was one of those who experienced the loss of funds. On Dec. 2, he sent $190 from Coinbase to his Chivo wallet for an upcoming visit to his home country, he told CoinDesk.  Noticing that the amount was slow to arrive, Guardado decided to trace the hash of the transaction. He discovered that the amount had been sent from his Coinbase wallet to a temporary address provided by Chivo from which it sends money to final recipients, but within the hour it had been removed from there. And the money never arrived in his wallet.  Guardado is no newbie to the crypto world, having started investing four years ago in coins such as bitcoin and ether.  “The glitch is not from Coinbase. I have the blockchain record, which says the money was released,” Guardado said.  Guardado called Chivo’s customer service center and received a case number. Chivo’s official Twitter account also contacted Guardado, but as of Dec. 16, it had stopped answering his messages, according to screenshots Guardado provided to CoinDesk.  Rafael, a Salvadoran who preferred not to disclose his last name, faces a similar problem. Based in Australia, he transferred $450 in bitcoin from Coinbase to his Chivo wallet on Dec. 5. But the money never arrived.  Chivo’s customer service team told Rafael that the technical department was reviewing his case, but never allowed him to speak directly with the department.  “It is always the same thing, they tell me to be patient,” he told CoinDesk. So far, Rafael has spent more than $60 on phone calls to Chivo’s call center, as he didn’t receive any answers via Twitter.  “I am already writing that money off,” he said of the $60.  In an email sent to CoinDesk, Felix Munguía said that on Dec. 9 he sent $500 from his Chivo wallet to an account at Banco Cuscatlan. However, he later received a call from Chivo Wallet notifying him that the bank hadn’t accepted the deposit and that the money would be restored to his wallet.  Ultimately, however, the $500 never arrived in his Chivo wallet, and since that day, he hasn’t received any additional response from the company.  A mass of cases, and scams, too  The Twitter account @_elcomisionado_ started a Twitter thread on Dec. 18 for cases of reported fund theft. So far, the account has posted 74 cases.  “But there are many more, I have only posted the ones that mention amounts,” the account owner, who declined to reveal his or her identity, told CoinDesk.  Chivo’s support staff didn’t respond to CoinDesk’s questions about how many accounts have been affected or how the funds could have disappeared.  According to the terms and conditions published by Chivo Wallet, it “will not be liable for any loss or damage that the user may suffer as a result of unauthorized third party access to your account as a result of hacks or lost passwords.”  According to @_elcomisionado_, complaints about funds disappearing became more acute on Dec. 15, when an Amazon Web Services server crash affected Chivo Wallet.  Margot Vieytez was one of the people whose cases @_elcomisionado_ highlighted. Vieytez had $49 disappear from her Chivo wallet in December. Seeking help, she posted about the situation on Twitter and received a response from what she thought was a Chivo support account, which she would later discover was fake.  After opening a link that referred her to a WhatsApp chat, the scammer asked her to deposit money in her Chivo wallet to recover the funds. Vieytez put in $100, and was asked for more. She put in another $100 and, again, was asked for more. When the account had $400 in it, the scammer took all the money.  Vieytez is now considering filing a complaint with the Consumer Ombudsman’s Office or going to the prosecutor’s office, she told CoinDesk.  “I’m not worried about my $400, I’m worried about the number of Salvadorans with this application in use,” said Vieytez, who added that most people in El Salvador don’t have enough resources to file formal complaints.  Attempted scams with Chivo Wallet are the order of the day in El Salvador. After Guardado described his case on Twitter, he was contacted by what appeared to be a Chivo support account, which began asking him for sensitive information to solve the problem of the missing funds. Guardado didn’t provide the information.  Wanting to retire next year in El Salvador, Guardado had thought about using the Chivo Wallet to send money to the country. “Now I’m having second thoughts,” he said, adding that although he supports the implementation of bitcoin in the country, the government needs to resolve security issues with the Chivo Wallet.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Andrés Engler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/12/30/after-identity-theft-salvadorans-now-report-funds-disappearing-from-chivo-wallets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4988e09c8c8ab8b9ebbd724d6e34c0687ec4efe2-1024x683.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42375660,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw9Y4n,1640899047,"Market Wrap Year-End Review: Bitcoin ETF Rally Proved Short-Lived, and $100K Dreams Faded","Hi, Market Wrap readers! During the final two weeks of 2021, we’re using this space to recap the year’s most dramatic moments in cryptocurrency markets – and highlight key lessons from this fast-evolving corner of global finance. Over a series of eight posts that started on Dec. 20 and ends today, we recapped what shook crypto markets this year. (Please scroll down for today’s crypto prices and the latest headlines.)  On Wednesday, we walked through the events leading up to bitcoin’s rise from $30,000 to $50,000. El Salvador’s decision to adopt BTC as legal tender appeared to have been priced in from June, and buyers started to take some profits when the Central American country’s law went into effect in September. During that time, bitcoin and stocks began to fall as concerns about China’s property debt risk lingered.  But the September dip didn’t last long. The market got a fresh jolt of enthusiasm when the first U.S. bitcoin exchange-traded fund – a bitcoin futures ETF, that is – launched in the fourth quarter. Bitcoin climbed from $40,000 toward $65,000 in October, spurring visions of $100,000 by the end of the year. It was not to be: The rally fizzled, bitcoin’s notorious volatility returned, and the six-figure price prediction proved wildly optimistic.  The first U.S. bitcoin-linked ETF  After months of delays, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler announced in August his preference for a bitcoin futures-based exchange-traded fund. Traders became hopeful that the SEC would approve a bitcoin-linked ETF in October.  Lurking behind those hopes was the belief that many investors in traditional markets wanted to bet on bitcoin but lacked the technological setup or know-how to do so; an ETF would let them buy into bitcoin with the ease of buying a stock in an online brokerage account.  For years, crypto industry executives had speculated that the SEC’s approval of a bitcoin ETF – denied multiple times under former SEC Chairman Jay Clayton – might finally bring about the perceived holy grail of “institutional adoption” of the cryptocurrency.  But not all bitcoin-related ETFs are created the same: A bitcoin futures ETF is backed by futures contracts such as those traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. A bitcoin “spot” ETF, by contrast, is one backed directly by the cryptocurrency.  “I think his comments are pretty clear that a pure spot bitcoin ETF isn’t coming soon and that futures products would potentially be considered,” Steven McClurg, chief investment officer for Valkyrie, told CoinDesk at the time.  Experts on the topic warned that a bitcoin futures ETF would be subject to disadvantages, most notably the existence of a phenomenon known as “contango bleed” or “roll costs” that would eat into investor returns.  Even so, some analysts predicted that the mere approval of a bitcoin ETF, whether spot or futures-based, would make crypto more accessible to traditional investors and thereby boost overall market sentiment.  On Oct. 15, bitcoin reclaimed the $60,000 price level as investors eagerly awaited a bitcoin ETF approval.  And on Oct. 19, the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy exchange-traded fund (NYSE: BITO), the first bitcoin futures-related ETF to trade in the U.S., went live.  Dave Nadig, chief investment officer and director of research of ETF Trends, said that much of the volume on BITO’s first trading day appeared to come from retail investors, because there were few large “block” trades of the size that big institutional traders often deal in.  “This is probably going to be what we all expected, which is it’s an access vehicle for certain players in the marketplace,” Nadig said in a phone interview with CoinDesk at the time. “There’s lots of folks who are active participants in the markets who just don’t want to cross over the crypto bridge by themselves.”  Bitcoin overbought  But with bitcoin already up about 40% in the first two weeks of October, some analysts began to question whether the BITO ETF was another “buy-the-rumor, sell-the-fact” event.  “Look, we’re up 40% this month, which is only 15 days old, a pause that refreshes,” Mark Yusko, CEO and chief investment officer of Morgan Creek Capital Management, said during a CNBC interview on Oct. 17. “Given how overbought we are right now,” Yusko said, a fresh sell-off “wouldn’t surprise me.”  Crypto bulls weren’t done yet. In the days following BITO’s trading debut, bitcoin continued upward to hit an all-time price high of around $69,000. Several alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) joined the rally. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, rose above $4,000 for the first time since mid-May.  But as November set in, buyers failed to sustain new highs. Bitcoin began a descent below $60,000 as heavily leveraged traders began to liquidate their positions. Some indicators such as the crypto “Fear & Greed Index” showed the market in “extreme greed” territory, which typically precedes price drops, as shown in the chart below.  After many volatile price swings this year, bitcoin eventually stabilized just below $50,000 as of late December.  Optimistic price calls made earlier in the year, such as a prediction for $100,000 BTC by the end of year, now look quaint, especially with bullish sentiment deteriorating over the past month.  Some analysts remain hopeful of a short-term price bounce going into the new year, similar to what happened the last time around.  At the very least, crypto investors can probably expect another volatile ride in 2022.

Corey Frayer, who spent a decade working as a senior adviser to members of Congress before becoming a senior staffer on the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs under committee chairman Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), has been tapped for the role.  Gensler’s appointment of a crypto-focused senior adviser is in line with his stated focus on establishing a regulatory framework for crypto, as well as a signal that the SEC could step up its efforts to regulate the industry in 2022.  According to a source familiar with the Senate Banking Committee, Frayer spearheaded crypto policy for Brown – who has been outspoken about his concerns about the risks cryptocurrencies could pose to investors, calling blockchain a “shady diffuse network of online funny money” at a hearing in July – and other top-ranking Democrats.  According to the announcement, Frayer’s new role at the SEC will focus on “policymaking and interagency work relating to the oversight of crypto assets.”  Frayer has a degree in International Economics and Finance from the Catholic University of America.

42375603,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw9HlJ,1640890686,SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce Says Washington Doesn’t Need a New Crypto Regulator,"Forming a single regulator to oversee crypto would not be a panacea for the industry’s regulatory woes, said U.S. Securities and Exchange (SEC) Commissioner Hester Peirce on CoinDesk TV’s First Mover Thursday.  “I certainly understand the impulse to call for one regulator. I have a couple problems with it,” Peirce said. “Typically in Washington, when you build another regulator, all you get is all the existing regulators plus one.”  Coinbase is among the the voices calling for a new, single U.S. regulator to oversee crypto, while U.S. Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) supports the creation of a private, self-regulatory organization (SRO) for the industry.  Peirce – affectionately called “Crypto Mom” by many cryptocurrency enthusiasts for her longstanding support for the industry – has been outspoken about what she sees as the SEC’s failure to provide a working regulatory framework for the crypto industry, and its tendency to regulate by enforcement.  “We have an opportunity to sit down and work with people, many of whom have been very open about their willingness to come in and work with us and develop regulation,” Peirce said. “So far, we’ve really provided very little concrete regulatory progress.”  “What we’ve done instead is we’ve brought one-off enforcement actions,” said Peirce.  Though these enforcement actions have increased under the leadership of SEC Chair Gary Gensler, Peirce pointed out that Gensler’s approach to crypto regulation – which is much more aggressive than that of his predecessor, Jay Clayton, who now works for Sullivan & Cromwell and advises several crypto firms, including Fireblocks – is evidence of Gensler’s desire to draw clear lines for the industry.  “I’m just hopeful that we set our minds to work at building something that makes sense in terms of regulatory clarity, instead of always just falling back on enforcement,” said Peirce.  The SEC looks at NFTs  Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) exploded in popularity in 2021, reaching $22 billion in trading by December.  According to Peirce, the SEC is taking notice.  “Given the breadth of the NFT landscape, certain pieces of it might fall within our jurisdiction,” Peirce told First Mover. “People need to be thinking about potential places where NFTs might run into the securities regulatory regime.”  While Peirce couldn’t say exactly where the SEC’s issues with NFTs might lie, she warned about the fractionalization of NFTs – a growing market which surpassed $215 million in trading in 2021.  “I think that’s an area where people do need to be careful,” Peirce said. “I think we’ll see during 2022 an increasing fractionalization of NFTs because these are valuable assets.”  When will a spot bitcoin ETF be approved?  The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF made history in October as the first bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) to receive approval from the SEC and begin trading.  But the ProShares ETF is a futures ETF – no spot ETF applications have been accepted, and Peirce said the SEC doesn’t appear to be in a hurry to approve any spot ETFs.  “I can’t believe we’re still talking about this as if, you know, we’re waiting for one to happen,” Peirce said. “We’ve issued a series of denials even recently, and those continue to use reasoning that I think was outdated at the time.”  Peirce added that she doesn’t understand the SEC’s reasoning for denying the spot ETF applications, which makes it difficult for her to predict the possibility of a spot ETF approval in 2022.  “Chair Gensler has said he wants to see platforms registering with us,” Peirce said. “So maybe that’s what it takes for a spot product to get approved.”  Read more: SEC Rejects Kryptoin Spot Bitcoin ETF Proposal  UPDATE (Dec. 30, 21:31 UTC): Added Sen.

42411598,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOzu6,1640888114,21 Predictions for Crypto and Beyond in 2022,"2021 has been the cryptocurrency industry’s biggest year ever. And that’s not just because token prices went up, which some did by thousands of percentage points, proving that epic crypto gains are still very much on the table. More importantly, crypto growth this year came in the form of major adoption, integration and innovation, such as El Salvador’s bitcoin policy and the embrace of NFTs by major brands and mainstream celebrities.  So what happens after the biggest year ever? Probably a not-as-big year.  This past year was unique, above all because the day-trading momentum that broke out during 2020 COVID lockdowns was carried forward into real adoption and innovation by the likes of Twitter. And crypto is generally highly cyclical, as new converts get overextended and burned, then retreat to lick their wounds and do some learning before they dive back in. 2021 already broke crypto’s formerly clockwork boom-and-bust rhythm, though, so anything is possible.  Even if it is less spectacular than 2021, 2022 will see major moves, such as the launch of Ethereum 2.0 (finally!) and a retreat of NFT-mania (probably!). And given the maturing of the industry, there will be plenty of capital to fund the continued building of interesting projects and plenty of opportunities to get involved if you’re paying attention. There are also major real-world factors that will affect crypto, from U.S. interest rates to inflation to COVID variants – some more predictable than others.  What follows is a mix of my own impressions of what’s coming, and the (usually far superior) insights of other crypto observers. None of it is financial advice, and most of it is probably wrong – but I hope it will help you form your own picture of the road ahead.  The overall token market flattens.  Expect at least a period of unstable and essentially flat token markets. I’m increasingly convinced we won’t see a 2018-style massive drawdown, but 2021 was such a huge year that a reversion to the mean is likely in strictly mathematical terms. I do think there’s a good possibility bitcoin sets a new all-time high above $69,000 by the end of 2022, though I wouldn’t bet on that being sustainable until 2023.  In fairness, I was far too bearish last time around – I thought we’d see a top at around $30,000 back in 2020, but that turned out to be anything but just another cycle. Momentum could very well pick back up, so consider this a projection lightly held.  Elon Musk will continue misleading and confusing people new to crypto.  By the end of 2022, once he’s caught up to the fact that it’s not Nick Szabo, Elon will claim to be Satoshi despite not “getting” proof-of-work (PoW). Craig Wright will sue him for defamation, and much hilarity will ensue.  NFTs keep tanking.  This one’s a bit of a layup since many formerly high-dollar non-fungible tokens are already bleeding, and a lot of those prices were likely manufactured via wash trading in the first place, so they have further to fall. I see the market for “profile pic” and celebrity-branded NFTs in particular coming way back down to earth, since a lot of their price action over the last 18 months has been based on the misperception that they’re “art” and will trade like a Basquiat or Van Gogh.  They’re not, and they won’t. For more insight into what actually makes real art valuable, as an NFT or in other forms, review my pieces on the art market and generative art.  Eth2 arrives.  It has been planned for years, but Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake (PoS) will finally take a definitive step forward next year as the new PoS Beacon Chain merges with the current PoW chain. That implies a degree of risk, and big advantages to the transition may not arrive until 2023, when the new Ethereum will begin introducing sharding.  Probably the most important thing to note is that at least until sharding is implemented, the PoS transition is NOT expected to affect transaction fees on Ethereum. High fees over the past year-plus have been substantially responsible for the popularity of other layer 1 blockchains like Avalanche, and so the Ethereum upgrade shouldn’t really disrupt that momentum (see below). (Note: The ETHDenver conference in February will be a good opportunity to get caught up on the nuances of all this.)  Layer 1 diversity is real.  One of the most genuinely bullish things I’ve seen this year is the fragmenting of user interest for real, meaningful applications across a number of blockchains. In the NFT sector, for instance, we’ve seen serious uptake not just on Solana, but on Tezos and other blockchains.  However, as the Bankless team discussed on its “5 Things We Got Right” episode, there are good reasons to think that over the longer term, it’s more likely that there will be two or three dominant smart contract chains than, say, five or six. Next year will be an expansion in the diversity of platforms people actually use, but it will be followed by real competition and, eventually, re-consolidation.  The Great Token Decoupling continues.  “Decoupling” here means that various crypto assets will stop simply tracking bitcoin’s price. Instead, each will see returns based on its individual value proposition. Decoupling has been happening slowly for years, but the process really accelerated in 2021.  The difference between the highest crypto returns and the lowest was truly dramatic: Layer 1 tokens solana (SOL) and terra (LUNA) returned 8,000% or more, while aging or flawed projects like EOS and internet computer fell more than 80%. The lesson is clear: It’s no longer enough to be “in crypto.” As with any investment, where you put your money really does matter.  For more on decoupling, see this year’s edition of Messari’s crypto theses, an annual must-read and a great way to get caught up on the year’s many transformative moments.  Bitcoin mining’s big sort.  Arcane Research predicts that we’ll see more bitcoin mining bans next year in countries with weak grids or low energy supplies, “while other energy-rich jurisdictions will embrace the industry.” It’s sad that countries and their citizens will see restrictions on their involvement in Bitcoin, both for their own sakes and because more distributed mining is better for the network itself.  But in the medium term, there are upsides here. The banning of mining in countries without sufficiently robust or sustainable electric grids should push more hash power toward cleaner energy, potentially blunting some of the one-sided environmental, social and governance (ESG) criticism that blew into the mainstream this year, largely thanks to Tesla’s Elon Musk.  Stocks keep going up, but more slowly.  Goldman Sachs predicts a 9% rise in the S&P 500 index. That’s not as much as this year, when the index went up 27%, but it would still be very healthy. On present fundamentals, it’s a defensible bet – the latest unemployment report, for instance, came in under projections, and consumer demand remains high many months after pandemic stimulus payments ended.  The lingering question is whether stocks have much room to run given how overextended price-to-earnings ratios already are. Tech and growth stocks like Tesla have been rocky in recent months, for instance leaving Cathie Wood’s Ark Innovation Fund down a sobering 20%. And CNBC’s recent Millionaire Survey finds that rich investors are losing their appetite for risk, which could let even more air out of the tires.  The Fed gets tight.  The U.S. Federal Reserve will be shrinking its bond-buying program starting in January, and is also expected to raise interest rates in 2022. That will have complicated and frankly uncertain impacts for crypto. In theory, it should help tamp down inflation, but could also put downward pressure on speculative investments that have attracted some of the loose money of recent years.  Keep in mind, though, that at least in conventional economic terms, this is good news. Near-zero interest rates only benefit people selling low-quality, high-risk investments. A rise of a point (or even two) would mean that we have room to move downward next time there’s a recession, providing a big advantage for U.S. long-term stability.  Bitcoin’s inflation narrative is tested.  As I’ve written recently, bitcoin didn’t respond to rising inflation the way it should have according to the “inflation hedge” thesis laid out by many advocates. As I argued, that’s because adoption hasn’t reached a point where the underlying price is stable enough. But if inflation continues or accelerates, even just for the first half of the year, bitcoin will need to show a market response for the narrative to remain credible in the medium term.  Tungsten cubes collapse.  Watch for secondhand cubes on eBay, but keep an eye on those shipping costs.  Meme coins wipe out.  Meme coins are basically a casino, but they enjoy positive feedback loops, because winners draw major public interest that keeps the wins rolling. Conversely, a downward or sideways cycle can be exceptionally brutal. 2022 will see less ape-like behavior among crypto newcomers and a consolidation around informed investment. That means coins like doge will continue losing steam (it peaked all the way back in May), and new pumps will have limited upside.  (Shiba inu is an interesting exception here, and a possible demonstration of how to turn a meme into a real project. Its ShibaSwap DEX is at least on its face fairly interesting, though I can’t say for sure whether it would elevate the project out of meme coin status even if it succeeds.)  The BUIDLers keep BUIDLing.  Believe it or not, flat or down markets tend to be very interesting times to be in crypto. The annoying shillers fall away and the engineers and others who are actually creating things have time to focus on the task at hand. Projects I’m excited about in the next BUIDL phase include Arweave, an innovative distributed storage system; Sign-in With Ethereum, which is pretty much what it sounds like; and whatever Jack Dorsey has planned at Block (formerly Square).  Rough waters for old hands.  The ascendance of Avalanche, Terra, Solana and Polkadot this year spells the end of real momentum for many projects that have been around for a while. They promised big things for years, but underperformed both technologically and in the markets during the biggest year in crypto so far. A partial list of projects I’d put in this category includes Litecoin, IOTA, Cardano, EOS and Hedera, based either on a lack of developer interest or technological mismatches with the direction the ecosystem is going.  USD inflation will peak.  It may even retreat by the end of next year. Sentiment is a huge factor in inflation because it guides forward-looking price and salary setting. Inflation seems likely to continue into early 2022 – for instance, food manufacturers have already announced price increases that will go into effect in January.  But there’s reason to expect cooling in the back half of the year. The death of President Biden’s Build Back Better is important symbolically for business sector sentiment and planning for inflation – whatever your feelings about the bill itself, its potential benefits to Americans or the scale of its actual potential impact on the money supply.  Further, early signs from South Africa are that the Omicron wave of COVID-19 will be relatively brief (mostly because it is so infectious). That could mean a lot of the pressures driving U.S. inflation over the past six months could start letting up by June or July. That includes supply bottlenecks caused by a lack of farmworkers and manufacturing shutdowns in China, and the unprecedented surge in durable-goods demand, which should taper off as people continue returning to some semblance of “normal” life.  Also remember that whatever the larger COVID picture looks like, summer will likely be a very low period, which should put at least temporary downward pressure on the goods consumption that has made up much of inflation.  DAOs will attract serious regulatory attention.  But in an abstract theoretical way – we might not see actual rules or enforcement unless someone uses a decentralized autonomous organization to do something truly insane. There’s a lot of talk about how DAOs are “the new corporation” and governments tend to regulate those. This is also where the rubber hits the road for decentralization: There will be some truly decentralized organizations that will be able, to one degree or another, ignore regulation. Those faking it will get smacked down.  Stablecoins get regulated.  That means both more enforcement actions from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission & Co., and at least the beginnings of a real rulemaking push. The good news is, U.S. regulators seem to be open to letting stablecoins exist. As investor Lyn Alden has pointed out, a regulated stablecoin market would basically mean a huge new infusion of Treasury-bill-backed liquidity worldwide. To me, that sounds like a formula for upward pressure on crypto asset prices, for better or worse.  More nations adopt bitcoin.  Immediately after El Salvador announced its new bitcoin policy, reports came in that other countries, mostly in South America, were considering similar moves. They just got a strong nudge from the Bank of England, which on Dec. 21 was given the go-ahead to essentially seize nearly $2 billion of Venezuela’s gold reserves. Instead, it may hand the gold over to Juan Guaido, a Venezuelan “opposition leader” beloved by Western intelligence agencies.  This sends a clear message to any country that dares push back against neoliberal hegemony: Not your bank, not your gold. Bitcoin presents a clearly appealing alternative to that threat.  Turkey descends into chaos.  President Tayyip Erdogan’s long campaign for total power ends where these things usually do: with an unchecked autocrat making terrible decisions because no one can afford to tell him the truth. His bizarre prisoner’s dilemma monetary policy lasts weeks, not months. Bitcoin traffic in Turkey continues to surge. This is the hyperinflation your parents warned you about.  The pandemic “ends.”  In his year-end blog post, Bill Gates projected that we’ll see an effective end to the COVID-19 pandemic next year. While Gates’ emphasis is on vaccines, it seems much more likely right now that the hyper-infectious Omicron variant will end the pandemic by infecting more or less everyone who isn’t already vaccinated (and killing a substantial number of them).  Facebook’s “metaverse” eats absolute shit.  Early quarterly reports on virtual-reality sales and usage are either bad or heavily massaged. Then the company redefines what it means by “metaverse” in the same way it kept retreating on Libra. Hundreds of millions of dollars are wasted.

42375658,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw9Y3X,1640887787,Swiss Central Bank Ready to Run With wCBDC in January: ‘Just Takes a Policy Decision’,"The Swiss National Bank (SNB) says it will technically be ready to launch a wholesale central bank digital currency (wCBDC) in January of next year, using Switzerland’s newly licensed Six Digital Exchange (SDX).  While it’s the retail-facing version of a CBDC that tends to grab most attention, the argument for wCBDC, designed to clear and settle wholesale payments, is compelling and less complicated to deploy in most cases.  Switzerland has been public about not opting for a retail CBDC, and whether SNB decides to launch a wCBDC remains a policy decision, said Thomas Moser, a member of the SNB’s governing board. But the necessary testing has now been successfully completed, he said.  “I would say we would be ready to go live in January, and it just takes a policy decision and the question of whether we legally could do a wholesale CBDC,” Moser said in an interview with CoinDesk. “But technically we would be ready to go live with a wCBDC on SDX.”  That said, Moser says there are no plans for going live at this point in time.  Highway to Helvetia  The Swiss central bank began working on a wCBDC concept with SDX and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) back in 2019, known as Project Helvetia. In addition, SNB has been working with Banque de France on cross-border wCBDCs this year, known as Project Jura.  The second phase of Helvetia has now been completed, with a report coming in January, Moser said. Phase 2 went deeper, with SNB and SDX integrating the wCBDC into core systems of five participating banks. (The participating banks have not been named but previously SDX was reported to be testing its systems with Citibank, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse.)  SDX itself was the other missing piece. After a series of delays, the digital asset trading venue and parent company SIX finally received the necessary licenses from Swiss markets regulator FINMA in September, and the first live transactions are expected later this month.  “Unlike a lot of the research projects done by central banks, this is testing with infrastructure that will soon be going live,” said Moser. “All the nitty-gritty and details are there. We did end-to-end connectivity, and checked how it would be on the balance sheet, how to book it.”  Atomic  The combination of digital cash and distributed ledger technology (DLT) – SDX is being built using R3′s permissioned Corda network – allows for “atomic settlement” where the transfer of one asset (a tokenized security, for example) is conditional on cash being transferred at the same time.  “If you really want to benefit from all the functionalities that the DLT provides, you really need the means of payment on the DLT itself,” Moser said, adding that certain trade-offs and practicalities are yet to be figured out.  For instance, atomic settlement on a blockchain means banks will have to rethink how they manage liquidity, according to Moser.  “Everyone complains about T+1 and T+2, which, of course, is slow,” he said. “But it gives banks time to do liquidity management. Atomic settlement makes the liquidity management for banks more complicated, and there are still interesting questions about costs and benefits.”  Stablecoins, which are pegged to currencies like the U.S. dollar or backed by other means, have become a cornerstone of the crypto economy. As part of its testing, SDX has been working on issuing a stablecoin pegged to the Swiss franc.  (It should be said, SDX is now a regulated market infrastructure that holds an account at the central bank, which is where the cash backing the stablecoin would be held. So, a rather more buttoned-up affair than Tether’s USDT, for example.)  Read more: Swiss Crypto Exchange SDX Said to Go Live Later This Month  Moser appears to be broadly in favor of stablecoins as a means of payment on blockchains, but added that a central bank would usually want settlement in central bank money when the infrastructure that is used becomes systemically important.  “The reason is that with a stablecoin you always have the counterparty risk of the issuer,” Moser said. “So if SDX should become a huge success and systemically important, then it would be a real question for us whether we want to provide the money there ourselves, the wCBDC. Instead of having a private company provide its own money.”",POSITIVE,USDT,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | USDT,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/11/09/swiss-central-bank-ready-to-run-with-wcbdc-in-january-just-takes-a-policy-decision,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3d3226dbb10f39cef1185770553d730b9f2eb48d-7072x5304.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Through a shoestring Twitter marketing campaign and the promise of a non-fungible token (NFT) airdrop, it took Kan and his team just 10 days to grow the platform’s Discord group to over 100,000 members.  But after pushing the launch date for the Solana-based marketplace up to Christmas Eve, a scammer hacked the Fractal Discord server’s verification bot and sent out a link to a phony drop, making off with over $150,000 in SOL from unsuspecting victims before being shut down.  “I can smile, you know, at least it wasn’t worse,” Kan, who paid the users back using his own bankroll, said in an interview with CoinDesk. “It certainly brought our team together.”  Kan has since rebounded from Fractal’s rocky week, now launching a platform that promises to grow the Web 3 gaming space. While NFTs are an emerging cornerstone of blockchain-based gaming, few third-party platforms actually exist dedicated to their commerce.  Flagship games  Fractal’s first slate of gaming partnerships includes over a dozen Web 3 titles such as user-owned metaverse game The Sandbox and play-to-earn games Genopets and Syn City. The platform serves as both a marketplace for users to buy NFTs directly from companies to use in-game as well as a secondary market for peer-to-peer trading.  Read more: Twitch Co-Founder Justin Kan Launches Gaming NFT Marketplace on Solana  Integrating NFTs into video games has received some pushback in recent weeks from the gaming community at large, but Kan believes that the tech will inevitably find its place in the industry.  “The idea that items in games can have value already exists,” Kan said, pointing to World of Warcraft’s gold-driven economy as well as Counter Strike, where users have paid as much as $150,000 for a skin.  While debate remains ongoing as to which party will benefit most from the presence of NFTs in gaming – the gamers or the game companies – Kan believes that formal ownership of gaming assets will ultimately favor users.  “Building [NFTs] into a programmable platform like we’re doing, I think it’s just a very pro-user move, even if some people haven’t seen it yet,” Kan said.",POSITIVE,SOL,MARKET | SOL | AIRDROP,Eli Tan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/12/30/justin-kans-gaming-nft-platform-goes-live-rebounding-from-150k-discord-exploit,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8aa5860b0834a1e5e36a4a50b3b13c5daa8c01ae-4912x3264.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42375645,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw9Xqx,1640879555,NFT Project Bored Ape Yacht Club Spawns ‘Left-Facing’ Copycats,"It’s a Bored Ape face-off.  On Wednesday, two Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) parody projects gained momentum on crypto Twitter, igniting plagiarism accusations, several trading bans and a robust supply of ape-themed memes.  The two collections – both named PHAYC, a play on “fake” and “BAYC” – appear to be identical copies of the original BAYC collection, but with each ape’s profile mirrored to the opposite side, or “left-facing”.  One PHAYC collection’s Twitter bio read: “PHAYC IT TIL YOU MAKE IT.” The other read: “Apes phace left on the right side of History.”  Within hours, profile pictures boasting left-facing cartoon primates saturated crypto Twitter with members tweeting self-deprecating NFT humor.  “I think the project is a satirical take on the current state of NFTs and members of the NFT community who might be taking the NFT market a little too seriously,” said Twitter user @rootslashbin (“root”), a member of the PHAYC community.  Adding to the drama, the left-facing derivative project sporting Twitter handle @phunkyApeYC claimed to be the original left-facing derivative project, and not, as it might appear to the untrained eye, the left-facing derivative project with handle @phaycbot.  Since its launch in April 2021, BAYC has emerged as one of the most successful NFT projects, touting prominent celebrities, athletes and crypto-influencers as owners.  On NFT marketplace OpenSea, the floor price (the lowest price at which a non-fungible token can be purchased) of a Bored Ape stood at just under 60 ETH, or about $220,000.  PHAYC project @phunkyApeYC launched Tuesday evening as a free mint to the first 8,500 claimers and generated about 60 ETH from the remaining 1,496 sales.  PHAYC project @phaycbot started several hours later, hauling in 500 ETH in sales and offered no free mints. Rival project @phunkyApeYC subsequently bashed its copycat for copying and profiteering from the sale.  Both PHAYC projects sold out in several hours, but were subsequently banned on OpenSea for allegedly violating the platform’s intellectual-property policies. (After a scramble to get the projects relisted on other secondary markets, @phunkyApeYC is currently live on Mintable, while @phaycbot is available on Rarible.)  “Intellectual property laws seem to be in a very weird spot when it comes to NFTs and $200,000 price tags for pictures of cartoon apes is an odd reality to come to terms with even for someone who has been in the space for years,” Twitter user root told CoinDesk.  It is not uncommon for successful NFT projects to be imitated through what are essentially copy-and-paste jobs, but whether those projects have violated an unspoken “code of ethics” is still a point of contention in the NFT community.  In crypto, riding on the coattails of another successful project has proven to be a winning formula time and time again.

Its 10,000-item profile pic (PFP) collection sold out in under a minute on Dec. 23, and is now holding onto a 0.49 ETH floor price as of press time. The project is the eighth-most popular collection on OpenSea by trade volume in the past week.  Owners of the NFTs will be granted access to the project’s “MTG Battle Station” game, where they can stake their NFTs for rewards in the form of Arcadia tokens.  “We want to show how gaming can be a lifestyle brand,” MTG co-founder Aaron Kirshenberg told CoinDesk in an interview. “Gamers can be musicians, athletes, all sorts of really passionate people. Our goal is to build the largest gaming community in the NFT space.”  It hasn’t yet been an easy sell.  Gamers revolted over announced plans to introduce NFTs to a popular Ubisoft title. The same drama unfolded when Stalker 2 announced – then quickly axed – its NFT intentions.  But Kirshenberg hopes his background can change the calculus. He is also the founder of Team New Age, a fast-growing North American esports group.  MTG said on Twitter it would “soon” ink a partnership deal with sportswear brand Champion, which plans to offer exclusive access to virtual merchandise and wearables on the MTG platform.

42375648,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw9XsD,1640874603,Umee Buckles Down for Mainnet With $32M Token Sale on CoinList,"Umee raised $32 million from community members who piled into the chain-hopping network’s UMEE token ahead of mainnet launch, slated for mid-February 2022.  Umee set a CoinList record with 922,000 wallet registrations, though only 64,000 ultimately bought, CoinList Head of Sales Mike Zajko told CoinDesk.  The flexible decentralized finance (DeFi) base layer, which plays nice with protocols built for Ethereum as well as its native Cosmos, closed the CoinList sellout earlier this month, CEO Brent Xu told CoinDesk.  Xu, a former bond trader who went full crypto in 2016, said Umee is focused on red-pilling the “inefficient” $200 trillion global debt market. It will therefore home in on supporting projects in the borrowing and lending segment of DeFi.  “There’s no other team that knows as much about [bonds], and so Umee really sits in this nice Venn diagram of being able to onboard a potentially huge market into DeFi,” he said.  Plans for Umee  Umee’s plan of attack starts with “rebuilding debt infrastructure” to make the “base layer” more nimble. Xu said his team is working on tools that help define how his network’s “money legos” handle global debt.  Read more: Umee Raises $6.3M to Connect Cosmos and Ethereum With Cross-Chain DeFi  Getting the big debt players in on blockchain’s radical transparency will take time. In February, Xu expects Umee will play almost exclusively to its crowd of crypto natives. But as the team starts to build functionality atop Umee’s proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, he thinks the broader market will notice.  That’s because the massive debt market is, by Xu’s telling, wildly inefficient in all the ways that DeFi excels. Cross-chain communicating smart contracts do away with the many bureaucratic steps of processing prepayments, for example.  “We want to build this universal debt hub that interacts with all the different networks,” he said, naming base layers like Solana and scaling solutions like Optimism and Arbitrum as targets for Umee’s growth.  DeFi connector  All this will take time and money. Umee’s new funds will finance teams of engineers, plus legal and compliance officers. In five years, Xu thinks the debt market migration will have begun to happen “naturally.”  It will also take tact. Umee, like many early-stage blockchain projects, operates as a centralized entity. But Xu said he’s committed to progressive decentralization.

For now, Umee’s validators are brawling it out with the burn-it-down mentality many testnet projects adopt to snuff out code flaws and harden for launch. “They’re trying to destroy each other,” Xu said. “We’re being prepared.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | ARB | TOKEN SALE,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/12/30/umee-buckles-down-for-mainnet-with-32m-token-sale-on-coinlist,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2072f6cc580a3fd7c3ec5c7496e2468c225f85bb-6000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411592,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOzdZ,1640872200,"The Psychology of Meme Coins, From Actual Investors","Everyone wants to believe in something. Enter memes, the supposed future of money according to enthusiastic crypto investors and, of course, Twitter.  The term “meme” comes from Richard Dawkins’ 1976 book “The Selfish Gene.” A genetic meme, as described by Dawkins, is a gene that copies itself and proliferates throughout the species by way of Darwinian natural selection. A cultural meme is, similarly, a behavior or idea that spreads throughout a culture even faster. If I share a joke with you and you share it with your friends, we create a ripple effect until the joke is known on a collective level, changing the species forever.  And when that joke is attached to an exchangeable value, it can theoretically become an actual currency.  This article originally appeared in Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter defining crypto, digital assets and the future of finance. Sign up here to receive it every Thursday.  Whether the hype is warranted – and whether meme coins will actually have any lasting value – remains to be seen. But ones like dogecoin have already proven masterful at driving powerful narratives that have gained attention from the likes of Snoop Dogg, Gene Simmons, Elon Musk and former adult film star Mia Khalifa.  The appeal of meme coins is community – and virality  There are over 15,000 cryptocurrencies fighting for our increasingly limited attention on Twitter, Reddit and the mainstream news.  Meme coins break through the noise and invite individuals to share a laugh together. While other tokens, such as Cardano’s ADA, promise utility and blockchain tech solutions, meme coins promise a good time.  Yet it’s not just fair-weather trend followers who are known for being bullish on meme coins. Take Gene Simmons, for instance, the once self-proclaimed God of Doge. Yes, Simmons played into the dogecoin hype, but he also famously invested $300,000 in ADA in February 2021. Simmons has expressed general praise of Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson. The Kiss frontman has encouraged his fans to do their own research, but he seems like the type to take crypto more or less seriously.  Meme coins are then, perhaps, a form of highbrow humor for people who are in the know. And everybody wants to be in the know. Driven by Reddit forums and social media hype, meme coins start off as a viral joke until, eventually, the joke is on the system itself.  How meme coins become ‘real’  Unlike bitcoin, which will stop minting at 21 million coins total, most meme coins are inflationary, meaning there could be an infinite supply. While you can earn a profit from buying and selling meme coins, they are not considered digital “gold,” or even silver for that matter. Because meme coins lack built-in scarcity that would make them a stronger inflation hedge, and they aren’t essential to a particular blockchain project’s functionality the way utility tokens are, meme coins are mostly speculative investments. Even dogecoin co-creator Jackson Palmer has criticized the way powerful influencers hype up the perceived value of meme coins.  Case in point: Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin reportedly dumped trillions of meme coins, including 300 trillion jejudoge, over 223 trillion kishu inu, 370 billion baby shiba and roughly 120 trillion huskytoken. All in all, the highest total value of each bucket was $800,000, despite there being trillions of coins in each.  Still, every successful meme coin comes to a pivotal moment that can make or break it. For Randi Hipper, an influencer known online as Miss Teen Crypto, meme coins are worth a second look when serious investors step up to claim them.  “I always look at who’s behind the project,” Hipper told CoinDesk. “Who’s tweeting about it?”  And more than tweets, Hipper and other meme coin investors also consider whether the coin has any practical use, often referred to as a “use case.”  “People like Elon Musk started tweeting, and then [dogecoin] got serious. Then Mark Cuban got in and started accepting dogecoin payment for the Mavericks,” Hipper says.  Ryan Fochtman, who invests in his spare time and also works in strategic partnerships for the educational platform MoneyMade, echoes Hipper’s sentiment: “Elon Musk is such a huge figure into the space. Coming in and backing such a coin that really had no utility and then saying that you can maybe buy Tesla with dogecoin in the future really got everyone’s ears perked up.”  But that was just the beginning – at least Fochtman hopes.  “Now you can go online and exchange dogecoin or shiba inu for tickets to go to AMC. The more use case that we can kind of get out of these altcoins is going to make for a better, overall more fun space. It brings altcoins more mainstream, and now more and more companies I believe are going to start a kind of domino effect where they’re just going to start falling and accepting crypto,” he said.  Investing in meme coins without getting burned  Nonetheless, investing in meme coins is somewhat of a gamble. But Fochtman uses a lesson taught to him by his grandfather, an “old school” commodities investor who liked crude oil stocks.  Surprisingly, the general best practices of meme coin investing aren’t very different from those recommended for alternative investing in general.  “I don’t get too greedy,” Fochtman told CoinDesk. He keeps about 10% to 15% of his portfolio in crypto – which is higher than most financial planners’ conservative recommendations of 1% to 5% – but the rest of his money is in traditional investments like his 401(k) and other brokerage accounts. Fochtman also has solid emergency savings and lives comfortably on his income with plenty of cushion.  He considers meme coin investments a long-term play, though he does watch them actively. When Fochtman “scores” big and is able to double his money, whether in coins like doge or shiba inu, he cashes out 2x his initial investment and lets whatever remains play out in the market.  Sometimes he wins more, and other times things tank. “That’s the kind of money that I don’t really have to worry about because my original investments were taken out,” he says. "" That’s just kind of ‘fun money’ from there, and I can hope that it continues to grow.”",NEUTRAL,ADA,ADA | ALTCOIN | BUSINESS | DOGE | SHIB,Megan DeMatteo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/12/30/the-psychology-of-meme-coins-from-actual-investors,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ad1251d139e7bc47f252cb85ac39673d2aa53ba1-3840x2560.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42411609,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glP0Ad,1640872200,One Big Regulatory Question Holds Advisors Back From Crypto,"The biggest regulatory question for advisors concerning digital assets today is: Are they securities or not?  Digital assets are still quite new, having only really burst into the mainstream over the past two to four years, while the central rules governing most financial advisors date back to World War II-era legislation like the Investment Advisers Act and the Securities Exchange Act. So today’s regulators, such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), have quite the job fitting the square peg of cryptocurrencies into the round hole of eight-decade-old laws.  I recently introduced readers of my newsletter columns to two different digital asset companies pushing into the registered investment advisor (RIA) market: Swan Bitcoin and HeightZero. Both of these companies have decided to narrow their focus to one or two types of cryptocurrencies, in part because they fear the regulatory scrutiny that may come when this big regulatory question is answered.  This article originally appeared in Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter defining crypto, digital assets and the future of finance. Sign up here to receive it every Thursday.  In Swan’s case, the company is focused solely on bitcoin.  “Many or most crypto assets have significant regulatory risk, particularly as it relates to being securities under U.S. law, but we think these problems are now solved for bitcoin,” said Andy Edstrom, the head of institutional investment at Swan Bitcoin. “We don’t think this question has been answered for most other digital assets, and they potentially pose problems for intermediaries like financial advisors.”  HeightZero, meanwhile, has decided to focus on both bitcoin and ether, but no other alternative coins (altcoins).  “As of right now, we want to be sure we’re listening to the SEC and making sure we’re doing everything we can to be compliant and keep our clients compliant,” said HeightZero founder A.J. Nary. “We don’t want to be in a position like Coinbase was when Ripple was declared a security, the SEC sued [Ripple], and [Coinbase] had to take the token off of its platform. If that happened to us, we would have to notify all our advisor clients that they were using a security. We want to protect our clients.”  Swan believes that ether is a security, however.  “The reality is that Ethereum isn’t really decentralized; the ownership is highly concentrated,” said Edstrom of the blockchain.”The proof-of-stake model they are moving to is inherently centralizing, because when you stake coins you end up getting more coins; thus, if you have more money, you make more money. So bitcoin is the only one we feel comfortable with.”  The great debate  At the heart of the debate are the SEC’s custody rules. If digital assets like cryptocurrencies are securities, then regulations require that they be held not by an advisor, but by qualified custodians. These rules are the reason financial advisors do not hold their clients’ assets but turn to companies like E*Trade, Schwab, BNY Mellon | Pershing and Fidelity to provide custody services.  Advisors and end-investors, for the most part, no longer hold stock certificates or paper bonds but a digital record of ownership for those investments, while the actual assets are held by a custodian on a centralized ledger within a central securities depository – and only qualified custodians are permitted to own the assets within this depository.  But digital assets, at heart, were invented to circumvent this system via a decentralized ledger and be “self-custodied.” By holding the cryptographic keys that enable me to access my cryptocurrency holdings, I am responsible for the safekeeping of those assets. They are also digital bearer assets – the person holding the keys is considered to be the owner of the assets.  What is a security, exactly?  The SEC defines a security as “the investment of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the efforts of others.”  Under this definition, bitcoin does not meet the criteria for being called a security because there is no readily identifiable, centralized third-party enterprise.  Earlier this year, at the Aspen Security Forum, SEC Chair Gary Gensler made it clear that many tokens should be considered securities.  Why not both?  For the time being, the answer to our big regulatory question appears to be “both.” Some cryptocurrencies are not securities while others are, at least for the time being. The SEC seems comfortable with thinking of bitcoin itself as a commodity, not a security (a commodity being defined as either a tangible item or an item made to be bought and sold in commerce that is rightfully regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission [CFTC] and not the SEC itself). And industry players like Height Zero feel pretty sure that the same can be said of ether – like bitcoin, it is a commodity.  But until greater regulatory clarity comes from the SEC and other federal policymakers, other altcoins should still be treated as if they were securities.  What if cryptos are securities?  In November 2020, the SEC solicited some guidelines from the financial industry to help determine whether advisors are working with a qualified digital asset custodian. A Dec. 6, 2020, response from the Open Economy Initiative noted that qualifications for digital assets should be based mainly on cybersecurity. A qualified digital custodian provides an offering ensuring secure key management and interoperability with different networks.  So as advisors begin to have more choice over where to custody clients’ digital assets, they should examine whether potential custody providers offer highly secure online custody services (hot wallets), offline services (cold storage) and potentially “deep cold” storage dividing custody recovery between different physical locations, which drastically reduces the chances of losing access to clients’ assets.  “Anyone who says they know what the SEC is going to do long term doesn’t really know what they are talking about,” said Nary. “I think it’s a good idea to take a very conservative approach to this space, especially if you are an SEC-registered advisor.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Christopher Robbins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/12/30/one-big-regulatory-question-holds-advisors-back-from-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/882225697086d9ae9328f74a89fda71cec0243f1-4050x6075.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411856,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glgi1F,1640865695,Cardano vs. Ethereum: Can ADA Solve Ether’s Problems?,"Cardano is a decentralized, open-source blockchain network that launched in September 2017. Like Ethereum, Cardano supports smart contract functionality (self executing computer programs) but plans to take them to the next level by ensuring higher speeds and broader interoperability. The hope is it will make them more functional and accessible than Ethereum smart contracts so that anyone – not just developers – can create their own decentralized applications.  Despite the project still being in development, Cardano is frequently touted as an “Ethereum killer” because it seeks to improve upon the second-largest cryptocurrency’s current infrastructure. These improvements include significantly cheaper fees, better scalability and higher transaction throughput and speed than what is currently offered by Ethereum’s 1.0 blockchain.  Cardano was founded by former Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson and former Ethereum executive assistant Jeremy Wood and is supervised by three separate entities: the Cardano Foundation, IOG (formerly known as IOHK) and Emurgo.  What is Ethereum?  Ethereum is a public, decentralized blockchain network that is also open-source and first introduced smart-contract functionality to the crypto world. It enables peer-to-peer transactions with its own in-house cryptocurrency, ether, and supports the creation of fungible tokens, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), semi-fungible tokens and decentralized applications.  Ethereum was launched in 2015 by eight co-founders, including Vitalik Buterin, who continues to be the main representative of Ethereum to this day, Charles Hoskinson, Gavin Wood, Anthony Di Iorio, Amir Chetrit, Jeffrey Wilcke, Mihai Alisie and Joseph Lubin.  Three Lessons Cardano learned from Ethereum  There are three main areas where Cardano has taken lessons from Ethereum’s second-generation infrastructure and improved on it.  Architecture: Cardano’s blockchain network is divided into two layers: the Cardano Settlement Layer (CSL) and the Cardano Computation Layer (CCL). The former is used for ADA transfers, while CCL supports the smart contract functionality that enables developers to create programs (decentralized applications, or dapps). It’s like having two separate rooms for different activities – this makes operations on both layers more efficient. A major advantage is that you could upgrade one of the rooms while leaving the other one untouched or perform two separate upgrades with independent attributes. By contrast, Ethereum handles both ETH transactions and smart contracts on the same layer, which often leads to congestion and high fees.  Consensus Mechanism: The key element that sets Cardano apart is its unique proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus algorithm – the mechanism that determines how new transactions are agreed upon and added to the blockchain. Known as Ouroboros, Cardano’s PoS system is more scalable and energy-efficient than Bitcoin’s proof-of-work(PoW) and claims to be the first provably secure system of its kind. In PoS networks, users don’t have to mine tokens; instead, they participate in the block-validation process by staking the native token. This involves locking up tokens (depositing them into a smart contract) in order to stand a chance of being selected to add new blocks to the blockchain. Staking systems are weighted, meaning the more coins you lock up, the higher your chance of being selected to add new transaction data to the next block. Similar to the PoW mechanism, stakers who are chosen to add new blocks are rewarded with newly minted coins for doing so. Ethereum has been using a PoW protocol – a slow and energy-consuming consensus mechanism – since its launch but it’s gradually moving to a PoS algorithm as part of the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, a major ongoing upgrade to the Ethereum blockchain to make it more scalable, energy efficient and cost-effective.  Approach: Unlike other blockchains, Cardano implements a scientific peer-reviewed process prior to the release of any new product, service or update. This provides a greater degree of confidence and assurance than is offered by a vast majority of other cryptocurrency projects. First, academic papers are written detailing new proposals and their underlying technologies. These papers are made available for independent review by computer scientists and other interested academic parties. Comments can be left publicly or sent privately when viewing each document. To date, over 128 papers have been published by Cardano. Ouroboros is one example of a feature that went through this rigorous process of a formal review that still continues to this day.  Five key problems Cardano aims to solve  Ethereum has enjoyed a lot of success over recent years, but as it’s grown its infrastructure has led to volatile transaction fees, congestion on the network and expensive node operating costs. Cardano, on the other hand, had the benefit of arriving later to market and its protocol was designed to address the main issues of Ethereum:  Scalability: This is one of the larger issues with PoW blockchains, including Bitcoin and Ethereum. Even though the initial version of Ethereum addresses some of the scalability issues of Bitcoin, it is still not capable of handling millions of new users. With the launch of Ethereum 2.0, the network could eventually handle up to 100,000 transactions per second (tps). But Cardano is working to reach millions of tps thanks to Hydra, a second-layer solution built on top of Ouroboros – you can think of it as an extension meant to improve the network, like adding an external memory or card reader to your laptop. Second-layer solutions are additional protocols built on top of a blockchain that perform certain tasks to reduce the workload for the main chain.  Interoperability: Another problem Cardano wants to solve is the lack of proper interoperability among blockchains. Most blockchain networks are independent and cannot communicate with each other because they use different architectures and coding languages. Ethereum achieves interoperability within its own ecosystem of tokens created to adhere to a specific standard, usually ERC-20. Cardano plans to build true interoperability so any user could move bitcoin to Ethereum without intermediaries and friction. This can theoretically be achieved through sidechains, which are parallel chains attached to the main chain, be it Bitcoin, Litecoin or Ethereum itself.  Sustainability: Every blockchain needs ongoing improvements, but who can fund developers willing to work on new upgrades if the network is fully decentralized? Cardano aims to solve this issue with a treasury. Whenever a block is mined, part of the ADA rewards will eventually go to the separate wallet, and when someone wants to propose changes to the network, they can submit a ballot and ask for grants. Eventually, ADA holders (stakeholders) vote and decide if the proposal should be granted or not. Conversely, the Ethereum Foundation, which has a major influence on how Ethereum works and where the network is heading to, is a centralized organization.  Governance: Cardano intends to host a stakeholder voting system in the form of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) once the final stage of its development, named “Voltaire,” is fully deployed. With Voltaire, the Cardano community will make meaningful decisions related to technical improvements, software updates and funding decisions. All ADA holders will be able to vote or delegate others to represent them as part of a liquid democratic system.  Philosophy: Last but not least, Cardano has a unique philosophy. It’s not just another blockchain. Cardano aims to become a global cryptocurrency ecosystem that would reach the unbanked people, support decentralized financial services, and make the world work better for all. For example, IOG has partnered with several governments of African countries to promote the blockchain for various use cases.  Cardano still has a lot to prove  It’s worth pointing out that at this stage only 62 dapps have been built on Cardano’s blockchain compared to more than 2,997 built on Ethereum. Not to mention, Ethereum’s market capitalization stands at $442 billion versus Cardano’s $45 billion market capitalization.  There is also 9 million ether currently locked away in DeFi protocols (worth $33,811,920,000 at press time) while it’s unknown exactly how many ADA tokens have been deposited in DeFi protocol smart contracts.  The road ahead is long for Cardano but thanks to its advanced technologies, rigorous approach and gift of hindsight, it appears to be in a strong position to challenge Ethereum’s dominance and address some of the most common blockchain problems earlier generation blockchains face, namely scalability, sustainability, interoperability and governance.",NEUTRAL,ADA | ETH,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET,Anatol Antonovici,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/cardano-vs-ethereum-can-ada-solve-ethers-problems,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/aa38b0e3d4aef524b907ad4552de1e6570450ef3-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

ALGO hit a resistance level at $1.60 in early European trading hours on Thursday, jumping from the $1.40 level on Wednesday night, data from CoinGecko showed.  The move came hours after the Algorand Foundation, which oversees development on layer 1 blockchain Algorand, announced a $3 million incentive program for Algofi, a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that relies on smart contracts to offer low-cost lending and borrowing services to users.  “Through a partnership with the @AlgoFoundation Aeneas DeFi Fund, Algofi will be launching a rewards program of $3MM (2MM $ALGO),” Algofi noted in a tweet this morning, adding the incentives will run for active users through the first quarter of 2022.  Algofi launched earlier this month with backing from Union Square Ventures, Arrington XRP Capital and others, saying a liquidity incentive program would be introduced in the coming weeks. It is one of the first DeFi products in the Algorand ecosystem.  From January, users of Algofi will algorithmically earn ALGO rewards when they borrow and lend ALGO and the dollar-pegged stablecoins algostable (STBL) and USD coin (USDC). Tokens will also be rewarded to users of goBTC and goETH, representations of bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) on the Algorand network, respectively, if they stake the assets on Algofi.  Developers of DeFi products often use token rewards to encourage usage of new systems. Incentivizing users with native tokens through value-accrual or yield-generating mechanisms like Algofi’s leads to early adopters interacting with new DeFi products, fueling activity and generating more usage of the new product’s native tokens.  The program follows the Algorand Foundation’s September announcement of a $300 million fund. The fund is earmarked for the creation and adoption of DeFi products built on the Algorand platform.",POSITIVE,ALGO | BTC,ALGO | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/12/30/algorand-surges-as-foundation-incentivizes-defi-activity-on-algofi,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/25459d6624ac7afc0c9d3667d5d06a0aa77caab9-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The move came ahead of a $6 billion options expiry for bitcoin (BTC) on Friday during a low-volume holiday period marked by volatility and range-bound price movement for larger-cap cryptocurrencies. Options are hedging instruments that allow investors the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date.  Among larger caps, cardano (ADA) and avalanche (AVAX) fell 6% in the past 24 hours while solana (SOL) and terra (LUNA) lost 4%.  Tokens of layer 1 blockchains – native blockchains over which other products and services can be built – rose as investors looked beyond the Ethereum ecosystem, which is bogged by high fees and long transaction times. That narrative has driven prices of LUNA, SOL, near (NEAR), fantom (FTM) and others higher in the past few weeks.  Prices of bitcoin and ether (ETH), the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, posted a small decrease in early Asian trading hours on Thursday. European trading hours saw a sudden surge, with bitcoin gaining nearly $500. That led to a brief resurgence in other larger-cap cryptocurrencies, with the likes of ADA rising to $1.35 from $1.30 in a few hours and LUNA climbing to $86 from $81.  The rise in prices in European trading hours caused over $11 million in liquidations, data from analytics tool Coinglass showed. Slightly over 91% of these liquidations were on short positions, or from traders who’d bet on falling prices.  Liquidations occur when traders borrow funds from exchanges to bet on crypto prices using a relatively small initial capital, one that is forfeited when prices reach a predetermined liquidation level. Thursday’s figures contributed to over $400 million in liquidations in the past 24 hours, with over $274 million occurring on bitcoin and ether futures alone.",NEGATIVE,ADA | BTC | LUNA,ADA | BTC | LUNA | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/12/30/cardano-avalanche-lead-crypto-decline-in-volatile-trading-session,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/11ff0f96046fc025f0faf1cb49e97d02b47e73e8-1280x854.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42375654,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw9XyV,1640854456,Bitcoin Investors Protect Against Even Lower Prices Ahead of New Year,"Purchases of put options on bitcoin increased as the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization fell under the $46,000 level during Asian trading hours on Thursday. Bitcoin failed to break the $51,000 resistance level earlier this week, implying more sellers than buyers in current market conditions.  Tuesday and Wednesday saw upward of a combined $1.76 billion in options volume on crypto exchanges tracked by Glassnode. That’s not typical, as data from Glassnode shows most option volumes on crypto exchanges are generated on Friday, ahead of low-volume weekends.  Nearly $1.7 billion in volume came from options powerhouse Deribit alone, and more than 46,000 puts were purchased for Dec. 31, the firm noted in a tweet.  Options are hedging instruments that give the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. Puts allow investors to make profits on falling prices, while buying calls allows profits on an upward move.  The large put purchases on Tuesday and Wednesday came ahead of a $6 billion options expiry. A total of 129,800 options contracts are set to expire on Friday, according to data provided by analytics tool Skew.  Option expiries are usually marked with market volatility ahead of their expiry date, as investors hedge their positions with spot or futures purchases, leading to a change in market dynamics.  Data suggests that bitcoin tends to move toward the “max pain” point in the lead-up to expiration and sees a strong directional move in days after settlement. Those in financial circles refer to max pain as the point where option purchases stand to lose the most money.  Crypto research funds noted the current max pain point for bitcoin is $48,000 – a level the asset breached on Tuesday.  Bitcoin traded at about $46,926 at the time of writing, dropping over $3,500 after reaching a resistance level of $51,000 on Monday. The $46,500 level has acted as support in December. The next support level is at the $43,500 mark should bitcoin fail to hold current levels.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/12/30/bitcoin-investors-protect-against-even-lower-prices-ahead-of-new-year,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9dce749650cbc63e7985c7d2dd26b4e52aba4875-2121x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The company has recently launched Choise.com alongside a new token, the CHO token.

Q: What is Choise.com, and how will it revolutionize the current Crypterium user experience? A: Choise.com is a clear and logical next step in our company&apos;s evolution. We entered the market when DeFi was just in its infancy, with the goal of building an easy-to-use crypto-fiat wallet.

The two were arrested under the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance (OSCO) for “dealing with property known or reasonably believed to represent proceeds of an indictable offense,” or money laundering.  The release said the suspects had opened personal accounts from May to November last year at various Hong Kong banks, including virtual banks and a cryptocurrency trading platform. They were accused of engaging in suspected money laundering by dealing with money from unknown sources through bank transfers, cash deposits and cryptocurrency.  The woman, 28, and her brother, 21, were arrested in Hong Kong’s Yau Tong district and released on bail pending further investigation. More arrests haven’t been ruled out.  Under the OSCO, a person commits an offense if he or she deals with any property knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that such property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person’s proceeds from an indictable offense. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a $5 million fine and 14 years in prison, and proceeds from the crime are subject to confiscation.
