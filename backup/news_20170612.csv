42379508,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX88P9H,1497294929,Indian Banks Select Microsoft As Exclusive Cloud Blockchain Provider,"A consortium of India-based banking firms including State Bank of India, ICICI Bank and DCB Bank has formally selected Microsoft Azure as their exclusive cloud partner.  As a part of this partnership, the 20 members of the BankChain consortium, which went public with its R&D efforts last month, will use Microsoft's Azure blockchain to host the nodes that will relay transactions on their distributed ledger systems.  According to a news release, the first active project to use Azure will be Primechain-KYC, a closed, permissioned blockchain built by Mumbai-based Primechain Technologies. The tool seeks to help clients share know-your-customer (KYC), anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing information.  Since adding blockchain to its Azure cloud computing platform in October 2015, Microsoft has added a steady stream of partners, including JP Morgan, Emercoin, and Bitshares, to its blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) solution – a product styled as a kind of 'sandbox' where partners can interact with different technologies in a low-risk environment.  As such, the partnership affirms how bringing blockchain to banking, financial services and the insurance industry has been a focus for Microsoft.

42379520,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX88PON,1497289504,$150 Million: Tim Draper-Backed Bancor Completes Largest-Ever ICO,"An initial coin offering (ICO) for a blockchain project called Bancor has set a new industry record, raising approximately $153m in ether, the native currency on the ethereum blockchain, as part of a crowdsale that concluded today.  Data shows a smart contract connected to the sale had collected more than 390,000 ether by the time it ended at 18:00 UTC, an amount worth $152.3m at current prices. As such, the figure is higher than even the funding raised by The DAO, the notorious failed fundraising project that made headlines last year when it lost the millions of the $152m in investor funds it raised in a similar sale.  Overall, 79,323,978 Bancor network tokens (BNTs) were created as part of the ICO, with the top token holders now possessing 83.96% of the tokens, or 66,601,702 BNT. Fifty percent of the total tokens, or 39,661,989 BNT, were sold to the public, while the remaining 50% were allocated for future use.  The ICO attracted 10,885 buyers, according to available data, with more than 15,000 transactions sent to the address for purchases during the sale. One buyer went so far as to purchase 6.9m BNT, or roughly $27m, in the sale.  Launched in 2017, Bancor, overseen by the Bprotocol Foundation, has been pitched as a platform designed to make it easier for users to launch their own blockchain tokens.  Of the remaining funds, a blog post by the company states token capital will be directed toward partnerships, community grants, public bounties and project advisors.  As with past sales of this kind, the ICO was accompanied by reports that the ethereum network faced significant transaction loads, resulting in delays for buyers.  However, the project itself was adversely affected by long wait times on ethereum.  According to the Bancor website, an initial funding target was set at 250,000 ether, though this figure was not hard-coded into the smart contract deployed. As a result, a transaction sent on the ethereum blockchain in an effort to change the contract and limit the crowdsale in length did not work as desired.  Due to network disruption and delays holding up this transaction, the company said the crowdsale ended up continuing longer than initially desired. Overall, it lasted an two additional hours as a result of the delay.  Posts on social media further suggest that at least some users saw transaction issues during the sale. One thread on Reddit drew complaints about transactions being dropped as long as 35 minutes after they were sent to the ICO address.  Some participants who spoke to CoinDesk also said that they had experienced delays in transacting, including one who had issues moving their ethers off an exchange for the purposes of participating in the ICO.  One exchange operator went so far as to argue that the ICO had increased transaction congestion, colorfully remarking that larger ether buyers were disrupting the sale.  Notable investors  Another factor contributing to the frenzy is that, as sale was getting underway, Bancor revealed it had attracted new and notable investors.  Among those announced to be contributing funds was investor Tim Draper of VC fund Draper Fisher Jurvetson. Though new to the ICO space – he previously backed the Tezos project ahead of its yet-to-be-held offering – Draper has invested in a number of bitcoin startups in the past few years.  In 2014, Draper made headlines when it emerged that he had bought 30,000 bitcoins during US government auction, later picking up an additional 2,000 BTC during a second sale. As part of the funding, Draper will also be joining the project as an advisor.  The Bancor sale was also backed by Blockchain Capital, an investment firm that focuses on startups in the space.  According to a blog post published today, Blockchain Capital is making its investment via its BCAP token, which it launched earlier this year.  'Insane' speculation  In the blockchain community, the reverberations of the sale were felt far and wide among market observers, many of whom expressed disbelief at the funding totals raised.  Some commentators, when reached by CoinDesk, simply responded by calling the investment 'insane'. Likewise, when asked if the total raised was related to project's fundamentals, Jaxx director of business and community and bitcoin entrepreneur Charlie Shrem simply responded: ""No.""  Even proponents of the token sale model found fault with the sale.  Nick Tomaino, a former business development manager at Coinbase and principal at Runa Capital, remarked that he hadn't been following the project due in part to the level of hype that it had attracted.  In particular, Tomaino took issue with how the project popularized news about investments in its token supply, noting the blog post that advertised investor Tim Draper's personal contribution.  ""Posting that the day of a token sale is not something that many teams really building something valuable would do,"" he told CoinDesk. He later added that he doesn't rule out founding teams, though, and that Bancor could well succeed in the face of doubts about its long-term value.  Still, others took it as a positive sign of market maturity. Among those to comment on the sale was JoyStream founder Bedeho Mender, who suggested that the raise had given him some pause, stating:  ""As someone actually building a decentralized application on bitcoin, it really makes me think what I am giving up in terms of community support and funding by staying on the platform.""  Representatives for Bancor did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  ICO boom  The blow-out sale follows other offerings in recent weeks that have generated significant activity, putting new attention on the token sale model as a method of project capitalization.  More notable entries have included web browser startup Brave, which raised $35m at then-current ether prices in just under seconds. Gnosis, an ethereum-based prediction market, also attracted a bevy of speculators for its $12.5m sale in April.  Indeed, the ICO model has emerged as an alternative to traditional venture capital in recent months, though some observers have questioned whether the speculative frenzy taking place today is a healthy one.  Others still have criticized ICOs as vehicles for scams that take advantage of an uninformed public's thirst for big gains in emerging technology.

The launch of ""Cheque Chain"", announced today, comes months after Emirates NBD tested the feature in conjunction with the central bank of the United Arab Emirates. The banking group began testing the tech in a bid to reduce fraud.  As one of the largest financial groups in the UAE, the bank announced that it will issue new check books that ""carry a unique QR code on every [check] leaf, along with a string of 20 random characters"".  Suhail Bin Terraf, the bank’s chief operating officer, said in a statement that be believes that the Cheque Chain solution will reduce fraud in the market significantly.  “Blockchain has the potential to significantly increase security and protection in banking transactions and we are delighted to be among the first in the UAE to utilise this new technology,” he said.  The country is not new to bank check fraud. According to the Khaleej Times, an English media service that covers UAE news, at least two cases were reported last month. In one case, a 31-year-old Emirati banker was alleged to have used his authority at the bank to produce false money transfer forms and check in the name of a customer.  The detailed timeline of the project is unknown. But during the launch phase to come, the bank’s internal blockchain will be used to register each leaf so that it can “validate the authenticity of the [check] at source”, according to Emirates.

42379513,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX88PJL,1497279616,Coin Center to Lawmakers: Blockchain Startups Are Best Advised to Leave US,"A Congressional hearing on Friday saw the non-profit blockchain advocacy group Coin Center call for a federal approach to money services licensure.  The House of Representatives Subcommittee on Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection – a part of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce – hosted a session on financial technology and consumer choice as part of its ongoing ""Disrupter"" series. Blockchain was on the agenda during a similar panel in March 2016, during which the tech's regulatory impact was weighed.  Among those appearing during the panel was Coin Center director of research Peter Van Valkenburgh, who, according to a hearing agenda, spoke alongside Jeanne Hogarth, vice president of the Center for Financial Services Innovation; Christina Tetreault, staff attorney for Consumer Union; and Javier Saade, managing director of Fenway Summer Ventures.  In his written statement, Van Valkenburgh argued that the US has an opportunity to lead on the fintech front – but at present, the current regulatory climate has resulted in a situation in which ""we are following not leading"".  Van Valkenburgh told the subcommittee:  ""A young innovator dreaming of building the financial infrastructure of the future would be well-advised to leave the U.S. Not because she should try and avoid justifiable consumer protections, or do it on the cheap in a foreign state that will look the other way, but—instead—because simply determining what the U.S. regulatory landscape demands from her is a herculean undertaking.""  One solution to easing that regulatory burden: curtailing the state-by-state approach to licensing money services businesses, like the kinds that work with digital currencies.  ""In order to reestablish the US as a leader, we need to rationalize the chaos of financial services regulation,"" he said. ""The state-by-state approach to money transmission licensing, in particular, jeopardizes not only permissionless innovation but also responsible innovation.""

42379516,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX88PEJ,1497275964,Advertising Trade Group to Use Ethereum Tokens in Fight Against Online Fraud,"The Data & Marketing Association (DMA), a traditional trade organization for data-driven marketing, has announced plans to launch a blockchain-based solution aimed at fighting online advertising fraud.  Called adChain, the product is collaboration with California startup MetaX that will find the two entities creating a smart contract on the public ethereum blockchain designed to prevent bots from fraudulently generating clicks at the cost of advertisers. Under the system, domains will hold adTokens on the registry as a means of accreditation, with the goal of proving that ads reach a real human audience.  ""DMA's advertiser members need to know that they are purchasing ads from legitimate publishers, and DMA's publisher members need to deliver accurate metrics along with a value in their publishing platform,"" said Tom Benton, CEO of DMA.  For advertisers, the solution will allow for the purchase of ad-space on sites that are provably fraud-free. For publishers, the product would helps maintain identity and veracity in the advertising supply chain.  According to Ken Brook, CEO of MetaX, the adChain protocol allows all parties involved to come to a consensus on what is fraudulent in digital advertising by creating a whitelist of trustworthy operators.  Brook said:  ""We believe many of the problems can be addressed with trusted identity and verification. Other parts of the adChain protocol can prevent domain spoofing, which is still a major industry problem.""  Ad money spent on fraudulent traffic is tipped to reach $16.4bn in 2017, more than double that of 2016, and the DMA claims its solution, outlined in a new white paperhttps://adtoken.com/white-paper/, will bring more transparency to digital advertising’s processes.  With the platform, however, domains can apply to be added to the registry, and if no other parties challenge their validity, they can begin trading with advertisers.  Community voting  Notably, the use of the public ethereum blockchain is key for the product, despite the fact it will have an intended business audience.  According to Brook, one of the more important components of the network will be its open reporting system, which will seek to help determine the conduct of those using the system with a token-based rewards mechanism to incentivize participation.  Brook added:  ""We can incentivize virtuous behavior by tokenizing the adChain protocol and rewarding those who report or prevent fraud by leveraging our token voting mechanism.""  In the case of a questionable domain, an adToken holder can deposit tokens equal to that of the new applicant. This will open a voting process where other holders can vote on the legitimacy of the new domain and if it should be allowed in. Rejected applicants can reapply again.  The news that adChain will pursue a token-based model comes amid a surge in interest for so-called initial coin offerings, a form of blockchain token distribution. Just last week, web browser Brave raised $35m in a record fast token sale in its hope to improve how users see and interact with digital advertising.  Deployment roadmap  According to those involved, the solution is now in the midst of building its network.  MetaX is currently integrating adChain with industry partners, such as demand-side systems (DSPs) and publishers, for a private beta that will run for the rest of the year. Oxford Bio Chron, a bot detection service, is the first to integrate the solution.  DMA and MetaX have also established the adChain Association (ACA), a non-profit governing body that will oversee the protocol. MetaX is providing DMA with the technical know-how while DMA will use its reach and influence to encourage adChain usage. New York blockchain startup ConsenSys is also involved in the project and will be building advertising services around the adChain protocol.  The public launch of the tokens – 1 billion in total – will take place later this month with an experimental deployment in August. One hundred million tokens have already been sold in a pre-sale to fund development and onboard a number of industry players.  The remaining 900m tokens will be broken down as such: 200m reserved for MetaX, 200m reserved for ConsenSys, and 500m for a public token sale capped at $10m.  Those involved are targeting early 2019 for a public launch.

42379515,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX88PGp,1497272511,Hyperledger Releases Beta Version of Fabric Blockchain,"One of the main blockchain initiatives within the Linux Foundation-led Hyperledger project has passed a key development milestone.  In a recent tweet, IBM's Open Technology CTO Chris Ferris, who also serves as chair of the project's technical steering committee, said Hyperledger has released the v1.0.0 beta of its Fabric blockchain platform for testing.  The beta version comes nearly a month after the previous second alpha phase of the project was announced, and paves the way for a more mature and stable platform upon which business applications can be built.  According to the release notes, over 200 changes have been made in the log since the last release including ""bug fixes, documentation and test coverage improvements, and UX improvements"".  Other updates include the implementation of the 'keep-alive' feature for better resiliency. A new tool called 'configtxlator' has also been added to ""enable users to translate the contents of a channel configuration transaction into a human readable form"".  A Chinese technical blogger, named Zeng Yi and based in Beijing, has already detailed the deployment process and claimed a successful testing result using the new beta.  Launched in early 2016 with the backing of tech giants like IBM (which contributed a significant portion of the initial Fabric code) and banks such as JPMorgan, the Hyperledger project has since grown to include more than 100 corporate and startup members.

42379502,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX88P4F,1497269274,Coinbase to Face Trial over Possible Role in Cryptsy Exchange Collapse,"A growing legal dispute between the customers of a now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange and the business itself has ensnared one of the industry's largest and best-funded startups.  Former customers of the exchange alleged in a complaint filed in December that Cryptsy and its CEO, Paul Vernon, laundered millions of dollars-worth of their funds through Coinbase over a several-year period as part of a bid to abscond with their money.  At the heart of the argument is that Coinbase, as a regulated money services business in more than 30 states, should have known that the approximately $8.3m in funds – which Vernon allegedly claimed were derived from Cryptsy’s profits, as well as his own activities – came from a questionable source.  The backstory: The case represents the last twist in the long-running Cryptsy saga.  Once one of the most voluminous exchanges for alternative digital currencies, Cryptsy collapsed in late 2015 after months of escalating service issues. Trading was ultimately suspended in early January of 2016, and just days later, the exchange went offline amid claims of insolvency and concealed theft.  A class action lawsuit, filed in Florida, soon followed, with a court-appointed receiver taking control of Cryptsy's assets in the spring of 2016, setting the stage of a settlement agreement between users and Vernon's ex-spouse, who was also named in the original suit.  Vernon, who has not responded in court to the suit, has denied allegations that he stole millions of dollars worth of funds from users.  The current saga: It's those funds that are at the center of the case between the class-action users and Coinbase.  Coinbase, which declined to comment on the lawsuit when reached for comment, sought to negotiate the dispute through arbitration, citing user agreements Vernon signed when he and Cryptsy first began exchanging funds through Coinbase. Further, the startup asked the court to stay the case pending that arbitration, as well as prevent discovery from taking place.  Yet, in a court order from 1st June, Judge Kenneth A Marra shot down Coinbase’s motions to compel arbitration and to stay discovery, arguing that Cryptsy users weren't bound by the agreements signed by Vernon.  Attorney David Silver, one of the lawyers representing the users, reiterated those arguments in an interview with CoinDesk.    ""We believe that Cryptsy users that did not sign the contract with Coinbase were entitled to their day in court and be judged by a jury of their peers,"" he said.""[W]e're quite happy the court agreed with us, and this case is going to move forward in the public light.""    He said that Cryptsy's body of users have been waiting years for some kind of resolution, highlighting how the value of bitcoin has risen sharply in that time.    ""The users we represent from Cryptsy, they’ve been killed,"" said Silver.      What comes next: Judge Marra's decision effectively blocks any effort to resolve the case out of court, setting the stage for discovery and for the suit to advance.    A broader class-action suit – in which Crypsty users have sought to reacquire funds lost during the exchange's collapse – is also moving ahead.  According to Silver, the legal team behind the class-action suit is gearing up for its first distribution of funds, gleaned from the settlement with Vernon's ex-spouse – a process he said should take place over the next several months. In the meantime, he said, the case filed against Cryptsy will continue following Marra's ruling.    ""We're gonna hit the ground running,"" said Silver.

At roughly 10:00 UTC this morning, bitcoin prices fell abruptly, dropping more than $300 in a span of minutes from $2,980 to a daily low of $2,650. The more than $300 decline came just hours after bitcoin climbed to a new high of $3,000 on the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, a weighted average of prices across major exchanges.  But while precipitous, the decline was short-lived, with prices returning to just under $2,900 a half hour later on the BPI.  According to analysts, early indications are the price capitulation could herald that the bitcoin price has diverged too far from fundamentals.  ""It is just standard technical divergences – we made a higher high on less volume and waning momentum,"" BTC VIX, organizer of the bitcoin trading forum Whale Club, told CoinDesk. ""[This could] signal a weakening trend.""  Indeed, the decline coincided with the closure of millions of dollars in long positions on OKCoin, one of the major leveraged bitcoin exchanges, a development that likely exacerbated the decline.  All in all, however, the price of bitcoin has been surging of late.  Though today's decline could give investors caution, bitcoin has risen more than $1,000 over the last 30 days as investor interest in cryptocurrencies continues to increase amid a period of robust gains for the asset class.

According to Richard Gendal Brown, the startup's architect and CTO, Corda has now moved to its first public beta phase, marking a notable milestone that follows its launch in November 2016. Brown announced the news in a blog post last week, adding that the latest version of the software includes new API documentation and an expanded codebase.  Corda is a distributed ledger platform providing APIs and codes for companies to build up blockchain-like applications, and is aimed at creating more efficiency in existing global financial markets.  As such, the development follows R3's more than $100m fundraising, announced at CoinDesk's Consensus 2017 conference, and as more enterprises are seeking to launch live networks using the software.  As reported by CoinDesk  , the Japanese financial giant Mizuho Group, intends to use Corda to ""digitize documents like letters of credit and bill of lading invoices"", a process it believes can reduce fraud, increase transparency and enhance the shift away from paper records.  Brown also said the Corda development team has been working with members privately to prove Corda, and that the plan is to release the results to the public in the coming months.  While the move into beta phase indicates Corda team's confidence in its product, Brown indicated that it might be some time before a version 1.0 of the software is available, as the team is working on its ability to commit to future API compatibility.  He explained:  ""You will be able to take apps you deploy on 1.0 and migrate them to run on future versions of Corda unchanged ...

42379521,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX88PQt,1497256814,"Bitcoin, Ethereum and a New Direction for Cryptocurrency Investment","Noelle Acheson is a 10-year veteran of company analysis and corporate finance, and a member of CoinDesk's product team.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday, exclusively to our subscribers.      This week CoinDesk released its State of Blockchain Q1 2017 study, which details recent trends, statistics and sentiment around cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.  While the entire report is worth a read (there are some surprises), two slides especially caught my attention. When put together and compared with current data, they point to what could be a fundamental shift in market dynamics.  The first one is slide 62:  Ninety-four percent of respondents to our 'Bitcoin and Ethereum Sentiment Survey' indicated that they were positive on the outlook for ethereum – almost three times as many as for bitcoin. The main reasons for the disillusionment with bitcoin appear to be the high fees, the increasing centralization and the outlook for scaling.  Interestingly, this has not slowed down the increase in the bitcoin price, which has climbed 160% since the end of Q1. It does, however, point to a growing interest in ethereum as an investment vehicle. The price of the platform's ether token has increased by 420% in the same period.  Now, take a look at this chart from slide 47:  This shows that ether purchases in Q1 were largely in bitcoin.  Now, why would investors give up bitcoin to buy into ethereum? Either they believe that bitcoin will soon start heading down – slide 62 shows that almost 45% of respondents are negative on the cryptocurrency – or that it could continue to go up, but that ethereum will increase by even more. Either way, we’re looking at an asset reallocation.  If you take a look at the ether trading volumes today, though, you see a different picture.  The volume of fiat purchases of ether has shot past that of bitcoin to account for approximately 70% of volume (at time of writing). A large part of that growth is due to a jump in interest from South Korea, but US dollar purchases have also increased significantly.  This looks like ‘new money’ is coming into cryptocurrencies and choosing ethereum over other alternatives. Bitcoin’s trading volume is also increasing (and still dwarfs that of ethereum), but not by as much.  What could this mean?  While trading data of a few weeks does not necessarily translate to new market trends, it could hint at a shift in portfolio prominence. While bitcoin has traditionally been the main cryptocurrency holding for both private and institutional portfolios, ether is emerging as a strong contender.  One interesting effect from this will most likely be a change in the conversation. It should move from the 'bitcoin isn't money' diatribe, to one of 'what can ethereum do?'.  Although over 85% of our survey respondents felt that ether could serve as a currency as well as bitcoin could, it has never worn the currency cloak like bitcoin has. Ether has traditionally been positioned more as a ‘digital token’ that can engage with scripts and contracts, and can be used to enable apps across a wide range of sectors.  From an asset allocation and a sentiment perspective, ether’s rise in prominence is encouraging.
