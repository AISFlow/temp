42420830,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWYlHJ,1637711284,Jury Deliberations Begin in Kleiman v. Wright Trial,"MIAMI – After weeks of contentious testimony, a federal jury was asked Tuesday to decide whether Craig Wright, who claims to have invented bitcoin, was in a business partnership with the late Dave Kleiman.  Kleiman’s estate has alleged that a partnership existed and that after Dave Kleiman’s death, Wright transferred partnership assets to entities he alone controlled and forged documents to make it look as though Dave Kleinman consented to the transfers.  Plaintiffs’ attorneys asked for mind-blowing sums, including $36 billion (the value of bitcoin at issue) for Dave Kleiman’s estate and $126 billion (the value of intellectual property at issue) for a business entity in which they assert Kleiman had a stake. If the jury finds that civil theft occurred, damages could be tripled. The plaintiffs also asked for $17 billion in punitive damages.  After closing arguments, the jury was given the case Tuesday afternoon but didn’t come to a verdict by 5:30 p.m., when they broke for the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday. The proceedings are slated to resume Monday.  Read more: Kleiman v. Wright: Bitcoin’s Trial of the Century Kicks Off in Miami  The crux of the case  According to the plaintiffs’ attorney Velvel (Devin) Freedman, the award would still leave Wright with $17 billion in bitcoin, plus intellectual property, but the lawyer said “it’ll hurt.”  On Tuesday morning prior to the proceeding, Wright told CoinDesk that if his opponents were awarded a judgment, “They have to get it. There’s nothing in my name.”  The saga goes back to Oct. 31, 2008, when someone posting under the name Satoshi Nakamoto posted a white paper online that described how Bitcoin would work. The cryptocurrency eventually boomed in popularity, with a single bitcoin reaching an all-time high price of $68,990.90 per coin. Wright in 2016 claimed to have written the Bitcoin white paper, but has never moved bitcoin tied to Satoshi – a move that could quiet the many skeptics and help to prove his claim.  Though very few in the crypto community believe Wright is Satoshi, the lawsuit takes his claim at face value: It assumes he is Satoshi and thus seeks 1.1 million BTC plus intellectual property the plaintiffs say Dave Kleinman and Wright developed together. Because Wright’s claim to being Satoshi wasn’t at issue for the plaintiffs, it wasn’t exhaustively examined.  Read more: Why Are We Still Debating Whether Craig Wright Is Satoshi?  Similarly, the ownership of the bitcoin in question and the wallet addresses where the coins are held weren’t examined or verified by a forensic blockchain analyst in court.  Instead, the crux of the case revolved around whether the relationship between Dave Kleiman and Wright amounted to a partnership.  Dave Kleiman’s brother Ira Kleiman, on behalf of Dave’s estate, filed the lawsuit in 2018, alleging that Dave Kleiman helped Wright develop the cryptocurrency and thus the estate is owed assets that came from their partnership. The estate accuses Wright of breach of partnership, conversion (“a distinct act of control wrongfully asserted over another’s personal property in a manner that is inconsistent with the other’s right to that property”) civil theft, fraud, constructive fraud and unjust enrichment.  W&K Info Defense Research, a business that was incorporated by Dave Kleiman in Florida in 2011, is also a plaintiff in the case. The entity is one vehicle through which Wright and Dave Kleiman allegedly mined hundreds of thousands of bitcoins and created valuable blockchain intellectual property (i.e., software, etc.). W&K – which now lists Ira Kleiman as its manager – accuses Wright of conversion, civil theft, fraud, constructive fraud, breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment.  ‘Two different Craig Wrights’  In closing arguments, Freedman sought to create a clear narrative for the jury after a trial that was filled with dozens of characters, complex technology and conflicting information. He argued there are “two different Craig Wrights”: one who, before litigation began, admitted that Dave Kleiman was his business partner and another who, after the lawsuit was filed, swore Kleiman wasn’t his business partner.  Freedman ran through the testimony and exhibits from the three and a half weeks of trial, attempting to show clearly that Wright had emailed Ira Kleiman to tell him that Dave Kleiman was his partner, but after running into trouble with Australian tax authorities, moved assets into entities that only Wright controlled and forged documents to make it look as though Dave Kleiman had voluntarily given up his claims to the assets.  Freedman asked the jury whether they would let Wright get away with “lies he told to Dave’s grieving family,” forgeries and “the lies he told you when he looked each of you in the eyes for four straight days [claiming to be a] victim and bragging about how smart and how rich he is.”  In closing arguments for the defense, attorney Andres Rivero emphasized that the question is not whether Craig Wright is a liar or cheater but “whether there was a partnership to invent and mine bitcoin.”  He drew a line at Dave Kleiman’s death and suggested that, however mucked up the situation may have become after Kleiman’s death – Rivero admitted Wright had contradicted himself – while Kleiman was alive, “there was no evidence of a written agreement between these men.”  When Kleiman had been in another business, there was a clear paper trail. Rivero showed an email dated Feb. 1, 2011, from Wright to Dave Kleiman where he suggested the possibility of setting up a partnership – thus implying one didn’t exist at that time. Except for an early 2008 email with Wright mentioning to Kleiman that he was working on bitcoin, emails between the two men never used the word bitcoin again, Rivero said.  “It doesn’t make sense,” Rivero argued that Kleiman, who struggled to pay for his home and phone bill, who was confined to a wheelchair and spent most of the last year of his life in a hospital with grave health problems, would have kept his fortune so secret that he didn’t cash it in to pay debts or ever mention it to close friends.  Rivero said it isn’t logical to believe that, given his physical state, Kleiman had the ability to set up a bitcoin operation – which required huge racks of computers – or oversee it from his hospital bed. Rivero implored the jury to set aside any sympathy for Kleiman or distaste for Wright and focus on the hard evidence.  Given a few minutes to speak again before the case went to the jury, Freedman played clips from a Wright deposition in which he said he and Dave Kleiman purposely used internet relay chats and video chats that would not leave evidence. Freedman also said Kleiman wouldn’t have needed massive computer racks – bitcoin could have been mined on a home computer until 2013.  Instructing the jury  According to instructions the judge read to the jury, a partnership could be a based on a written or oral agreement and must include each of the following elements: a common purpose; a joint proprietary interest in the subject matter or purpose of the partnership; the right to share profits and the duty to share losses; and joint control or right of control over the partnership. Plaintiffs must prove each of those elements by a preponderance of the evidence.  If they find a partnership existed, the jury of three men and seven women will have to determine the value of the assets of the partnership that correspond to David Kleiman’s partnership interest, which would then belong to his estate.  Without an agreement otherwise, Kleiman would be entitled to half. U.S. District Judge Beth Bloom told the jury that any damages awarded should be based on the present value of any bitcoin or intellectual property they found was part of the partnership, or both.  Speaking just outside the courtroom doors Tuesday morning, Wright suggested to CoinDesk that even this long trial’s conclusion won’t put an end to the saga.  “I tried to tell people the only thing I own is the [bitcoin mined from the] first 15 blocks,” Wright told CoinDesk Tuesday morning. That would be worth an amount that is “not small” but not “horribly large,” he said, after a rough calculation. (The first 15 bitcoin blocks would have generated 50 BTC each. Multiply that by the recent all-time high of $68,990.90 per bitcoin and you get $51.7 million.) Wright testified last week that assets are in his wife’s name – she’s the multibillionaire, he had said. She has separate court actions pending against Kleiman and those would need to be resolved before Kleiman could get any of them, he suggested.  Wright said Kleiman would likewise have trouble taking possession of any award granted to W&K. “Trust me, he won’t have the majority of W&K,” he said. One-third of that company is owned by Dave Kleiman, one-third by a company of Wright’s and one-third by Wright’s ex-wife Lynn, he said.  Catch up on the trial thus far:  Kleiman v.

Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market moves: Bitcoin edged toward $58,000 as altcoins and other layer 1 tokens recovered from seven-day lows.  Technician’s take: Momentum is improving as oversold readings appear on the chart.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $57,550 +1.82%  Ether (ETH): $4,346 +5.93%  Market moves  Bitcoin struggled to move above $58,000 during U.S. trading hours on Tuesday, while alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins), including ether and other layer 1 tokens recovered to above their seven-day lows.  As a result, the bitcoin dominance chart, which shows the extent of the crypto’s dominance over the rest of the market, continued to signal a bias toward altcoin exposure, according to TradingView, down to roughly 42.31% from October’s high at 47.41%.  Lucas Outumuro, head of research at blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock, noted a stronger correlation between the stock market and ether than between stocks and bitcoin.  “Bitcoin is struggling to consolidate as an inflation hedge but is also not following risk assets, which may be leaving some investors uncertain,” Outumuro said. “Ether has been more closely correlated to stocks, which suggests investors [are] treating it more like a risk-on trade.”  On the traditional markets, technology stocks moved the S&P 500 lowered on Tuesday, which could have a negative impact on the crypto market on Wednesday.  Technician’s take  Bitcoin Holds Support at $56K, Resistance at $60K-$63K  Bitcoin (BTC) appears to be oversold, which could support a brief rise toward the $60,000-$63,000 resistance zone.  The cryptocurrency has held short-term support at about $56,000 as selling pressure has stabilized.  The relative strength index (RSI) is rising from oversold levels, similar to what happened on Oct. 27, which preceded a price recovery. On the daily chart, the RSI is approaching oversold levels for the first time since late-September.  Further, bitcoin’s correction from an all-time high of nearly $69,000 appears to be exhausted, which could encourage buyers to return. Momentum is improving into the Asian trading day, although resistance at around $63,000 could limit further upside over the short term.

Increased Block Size In Cardano Cardano, in a recent blog post, announced that they were increasing block size by 12.5% to make room for the increased traffic that is expected on the network. The 8KB increase will see the total block size now at 72KB and will allow more transactions to be fitted in a single block.

Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, said consumers and investors may not understand how stablecoins work and the risks involved.  “I have significant concerns with the non-standardized terms applicable to redemption of particular stablecoins, how those terms differ from traditional assets, and how those terms may not be consistent across digital asset trading platforms,” Brown wrote in his letter to Circle, the payment services company that operates stablecoin USD coin (USDC).  After publication of this article, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire tweeted that he was looking forward to “responding and working with you to ensure consumers are appropriately protected.”  Brown also sent letters to cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase, Gemini and Binance.US, as well as blockchain infrastructure firm Paxos, which operates the USDP stablecoin; decentralized finance company TrustToken, which operates the TUSD stablecoin; and Centre, the Coinbase- and Circle-founded project that oversees the USDC stablecoin.  The report compiled by the President’s Working Group, along with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, is the first step toward establishing federal-level regulatory oversight of the stablecoin sector in the U.S.  The regulators behind the report called on Congress to bring stablecoins under federal supervision. The report indicated that should lawmakers fail to do so, the regulators themselves may step in through the interagency Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), which could designate stablecoin activities “systemically important” and thus subject to tighter supervision.

42396466,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT3c2I,1637702060,Market Wrap: Altcoins Outperform as Bitcoin Stabilizes,"Bitcoin’s price is starting to stabilize after a near-4% drop over the past week. The cryptocurrency was trading around $57,000 at press time and could go higher, initially toward $60,000-$63,000, according to technical indicators.  Analysts expect trading volumes to decline this week given the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday. “The last three years we’ve had downward volatility every time around this holiday; could be due to end of month rotations, options/futures expiries and rebalancing,” CryptoQuant wrote in a blog post.  Bitcoin is up about 3% over the past 24 hours, compared with an 8% rise in ether. Alternative cryptocurrencies are gaining ground relative to bitcoin, suggesting that traders are taking on more risk as the recent sell-off stabilizes.  Latest prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $57,854, +3.83%  Ether (ETH): $4,382, +8.32%  S&P 500: $4,690, +0.17%  Gold: $1,791, -0.99%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.68%  Increased market fear  The bitcoin Fear & Greed index is at the lowest level since late September, which preceded a BTC price recovery. The index suggests market participants are in “fear” mode, which some analysts view as a contrarian signal as buyers gradually return to the market.  “Typically in bull markets, the index indicates ‘greed’ or ‘extreme greed’ for more extended periods with short periodical visits to the ‘fear’ area, just like we saw this spring,” Arcane Research wrote in a Tuesday report.  Bitcoin versus the dollar  On the flip side, a rising U.S. dollar could be a headwind for bitcoin. The U.S. dollar has strengthened over the past few weeks as investors anticipate tighter monetary policy.  “We’ve seen a considerable run-up in the dollar alongside Fed funds rate futures, which now imply 100% chance of two rate hikes by end of 2022 and a nearly 40% chance of a third rate hike by next December,” Delphi Digital, a crypto research firm, wrote in a report Tuesday.  The chart below shows the recent rise in the dollar (inverted scale), which could signal further downside in bitcoin’s price. Generally, tighter monetary policy is negative for risk assets including stocks and cryptocurrencies.

42411637,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glPLlk,1637702030,Not All NFTs Are Securities,"Non-fungible tokens are here to stay because the possibilities and the opportunities of NFTs are boundless and go beyond art and celebrities’ tweets or photos. The future of NFTs lies in the business applications. The true power of NFT is providing authentication and facilitating the transfer of ownership. Thus, you can create NFTs for wine, a Dolce and Gabbana designed dress or a crown, a property or any physical or digital asset that is deemed unique.  Merav Ozair is a fintech professor at Rutgers Business School.  Because almost anything can be made an NFT – be they physical assets or digital assets – then:  In the case of physical assets, such as a World Chess Championship sethttps://shop.worldchess.com/algorand-limited-edition-set, the value of the NFT is tied to the value of the physical asset.  In the case of virtual assets, such as virtual real estate or virtual watches, their value might be difficult to determine. However, as we evolve to more applicable virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) use cases with the evolution of the metaverse, their value might become more tangible and commercialized.  While companies are experimenting with the applicability of NFTs across different industries and business use cases, regulators will soon feel the need to regulate these assets. The “one-trillion-dollar” question then becomes: Are NFTs securities?  This question does not (and should not) have a straightforward answer. As a member of the Academic Advisory Board at INATBA (International Association for Trusted Blockchain Applications), I have been spending much time and thought on this issue as part of “INATBA Policy Notes” on NFTs, DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) and DeFi (decentralized finance) to be proposed to the European Union’s Commission.  Deciding to apply one encompassing rule for all NFTs might be easy and simple to follow but may stifle innovation or, worse, impede global economic growth.  If an asset utilizes blockchain technology, this by itself does not change its function or economic use case. Same as in the case of electric cars. If a car utilizes electricity rather than gas, the change of energy use does not change its purpose, function or use case – it is still a car. We might need to consider modifications and adjustments for operations, but its function and usage does not change.  Innovation is evolving and the utilization of NFTs are boundless and hence should be examined use case by use case. For example, NFTs provide authentication so we can utilize NFTs to authenticate any certificate – a college degree, a marriage license, a deed or a title. These digital certificates or documents, although they use blockchain technology and tokenization, are not “assets” in the sense that they have a market value. Tokenization does not change the purpose and function of these documents – they are still certificates, with the advantage of blockchain technology to facilitate sharing, transfer and the ability to track these documents.  Every unique content can be authenticated via NFT. IPwe, a blockchain-enabled platform for intellectual property (IP) transactions, and IBM are working on a pilot to NFT IP, which will facilitate the IP commercialization and monetization and bring new liquidity for investors and innovations. Monetizing IP doesn’t constitute a security.  In the case of digital art, like Beeple’s $69 million “The First 5,000 Days” NFT (the most expensive NFT sold to date), this is still an art piece, although it is digital and you cannot hang it on the wall. But as with any collectibles, digital or physical, some may purchase them as a hobby and others as an investment. A physical painting is not considered a security, thus why would a digital art be considered as a security?  Even if the owner of the painting decides to use the painting as collateral for a business loan, this collateral is still not considered a security. The same should apply in the “tokenization world.” If NFTs are used in DeFi applications as collateral for a loan, they should not be classified as securities.  But what if you fractionalize the painting, to allow the ownership to be shared with a group of people? Fractionalization does not automatically make the asset a security under U.S. securities laws. Again, it depends on the purpose or the use case of the fractionalization.  Read more: Some NFTs Are Probably Illegal. Does the SEC Care?  Suppose you create a partnership or a co-op to facilitate the management of the painting among its many owners. As a group you may need to decide what to do with the painting – where to place it? How to secure it? Sell or keep? In such a case each member (i.e., “fractioned owner of the painting”) will have voting rights on how to govern and manage the painting. Voting rights, such as in the case of a membership in a co-op, does not constitute as a security. It is still an asset, granted owned by many (i.e., a group of people), but not a security.  A similar co-op governance can be applied in the tokenization world for an NFT by utilizing a DAO, which will provide voting rights to the members/users of the DAO and establish the structure of the governance, including proposing new rules, changing rules and so on. A DAO is a “faceless” governance system that can democratize society and alleviate social barriers. A DAO is a governance mechanism and doesn’t constitute a security. Hence, an NFT structured with a layer of DAO will not fall under securities laws.  If the purpose of the fractionalization of the physical painting is to create shares to be traded in a secondary market and provide liquidity, then in this case these “factions” will fall under securities laws.

Users previously told CoinDesk that their accounts were frozen by the exchange until they returned the DOGE, which was incorrectly transferred, back to the exchange.  Some users told CoinDesk their accounts had been unblocked over the past few days, and some said that they can use their funds for the other cryptocurrencies stored on their Binance wallet.  The largest crypto exchange in the world said on Tuesday that it is rebuilding its wallet from scratch to tackle the issue, which was caused by a recent software upgrade.  Binance uses a different setup than other platforms for DOGE, which is what lead to the issue, the exchange said. The issue caused old transactions to be resent to 1,674 users, the company said.  The incident caught the attention of Tesla CEO Elon Musk.  Musk asked Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao to say that the DOGE issue “sounds shady.”  Binance responded that it was “not shady - just frustrating,” adding details about the fix.

42411630,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glPLRu,1637699712,‘Crypto-States’ Will Compete With Corporates in the Metaverse,"What kind of metaverse would you like to live in?  With the announcement of Facebook’s rebrand to “Meta” – where the social media giant designs and builds “the metaverse” and claims the next digital frontier – the battle for the future of cyberspace is on.  What is “the metaverse”?  “The metaverse” describes virtual worlds that break distinctions between digital and physical space. In more detail, the metaverse has been described as “a massively scaled and interoperable network of real-time rendered 3D virtual worlds which can be experienced synchronously and persistently by an effectively unlimited number of users, and with continuity of data, such as identity, history, entitlements, objects, communications and payments.”  The concept is aptly depicted in Neil Stephenson’s 1992 Novel “Snow Crash” where people plug in to conduct business and socialize in commercially owned digital worlds, the book turned film “Ready Player One” and the recent film “Free Guy,” where a non-player character becomes a sentient artificial intelligence.  Metaverse investor and writer Matthew Ball estimates the metaverse could be worth up to $30 trillion in the next decade. How this impending digital reality is built and governed will determine societal outcomes in the near future and for generations to come. This piece argues that the battle for the future of the metaverse comes down to hardware.  Centralized versus decentralized visions  The two major competing visions for the metaverse are private versus public.  The privatized metaverse is a centralized future where big corporates such as Facebook’s “Meta” determine how people “socialize, learn, collaborate and play.” This occurs through virtual reality (via headsets that project a digital world) and augmented reality (such as glasses, that project digital things over the physical world).  The private metaverse is owned and governed by Facebook, and value is extracted from users as consumers. First, Facebook attempted a blockchain and cryptocurrency play with Libra (rebranded to Diem). Now, crypto people are once again riled up about Facebook for trying to steal and monopolize another Web 3.0 (the participatory web) idea and monopolize it, as Facebook announced that its metaverse will leverage non-fungible-tokens (NFTs) to represent and exchange digital assets.  An anonymous collective of crypto community members recently released a jointly signed “Declaration of the Interdependence of Cyberspace” that builds on the ideas in John Perry Barlow’s famous “Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace” from 1996. “Your cookies, copyrights and capital may centralize your control for a small time, but they will not work in a world that will soon distribute power,” the document says as a warning to Facebook. Crypto communities are determined to collectively own the metaverse by building it themselves.  Read more: A Crypto Guide to the Metaverse  In contrast, the public metaverse is a vision of numerous, decentralized digital worlds that people can move between that are built and owned by participants. The public metaverse is predicated on open, interoperable decentralized technological architecture. It integrates a suite of crypto community innovations in decentralized finance (DeFi) for payments and NFTs for digital in-world items that hold real value. Furthermore, the public metaverse is governed and owned by “decentralized autonomous organizations” (or DAOs) where distributed, objective-aligned communities collectively own, govern and work in digital worlds.  Down to the hardware  The base, foundational layer of the metaverse is hardware.  The metaverse is dependent on physical devices to access and interact with the metaverse. Facebook is pursuing hardware interfaces to the metaverse through the Oculus virtual reality headset (which they acquired for $1.6 billion), and an augmented reality (AR) glasses partnership with Rayban.  Hardware is a core enabler to make the metaverse possible, along with compute, networking, payment services and interoperability standards.  Yet, hardware is hard. Infamous open hardware hacker Andrew “Bunnie” Huang states that “hardware is all about supply chains”, and a particular challenge in souring reliable supply, is microchips.  Microchips are the building blocks of computer hardware. Chips are extremely expertise and labor intensive. Factories cost billions to build and there are only a few in the world. The largest and most advanced chip maker is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), which manufactures over half of the world’s made-to-order chip supply, and the company is worth $550 billion. These small, wafer sized chips power mobile devices, “internet of things” hardware, refrigerators, cars, 5G telecommunications networks and artificial intelligence.  COVID-19 significantly disrupted supply chains due to lockdowns, shipping delays and supply disruptions with cancellations from some industries such as automotive, and increased consumption in others, such as consumer electronics. This leaves the technological advancement of nation-states vulnerable to supply chain shortages. These disruptions have revealed how fragile the microchip supply chain is, resulting in increased geopolitical tension between nation-states over microchip manufacturing.  Now, “crypto-states” also want to compete in the microchip industry to supply the essential hardware for the open metaverse. A16z’s Balaji Srinivasan describes “network-states” and “cloud cities” as virtual political entities that can collectively negotiate, fund, build, maintain and reproduce without relying on external resources. Blockchain-based DAOs are just this - in their ability to bootstrap a digital economy, collectively negotiate and crowdfund territory in the real world.  Read more: The Metaverse We Didn’t Ask For  These crypto cities and network-states are popping up everywhere, including CityDAO buying land in Wyoming, ConstitutionDAO aiming to buy and co-own an original copy of the U.S. Constitution, and Kong Land looking to mass manufacture open microchips.  Kong Land crypto-state  The Kong Land crypto-state is the brainchild of serious open hardware hackers. Having successfully exited a physical door lock business in Silicon Valley, the co-initiators of Kong Land released the “ARX” whitepaper in 2018, which first articulated the vision for trust through open silicon chip manufacturing. In 2019, open chips were trialed in their first use case: physical hardware notes of “crypto cash.” Known as “Kong Cash,” the notes have a microchip embedded in them which links to a smart contract to verify and ultimately access cryptocurrency. Experimentation in open chips has recently culminated in “Kong Land” with the launch of NFT “citizen” tokens to build the community for an open chip manufacturing and utilization DAO.  Kong Land is predicated on secure hardware at the silicon level through cryptographic key ownership which links to blockchain-based smart contracts to bridge the physical world to the digital world and usher in an open metaverse. Kong Land chips have the potential for any use case you can think of. The Kong Land manifesto states that “At inception, Kong Land will export crypto assets for projects like stablecoins, identities and art ... Given sufficient funds, it will ultimately seek to continue research around more secure forms of physical crypto assets.”  This metaverse is owned by “citizens” who acquire governance rights through early buy-in, sign a “Kongstitution” social graph distribution, or work for tokens in accordance with the Kong “green card” policy initiative. Against the threat of Facebook’s proposal for a centralized, corporate metaverse, Kong Land early contributor Paul states that “The infrastructure of registering real items with virtual items shouldn’t be a private entity, it should be a public good”.  Cryptographically secured microchips are a way for people to hold their own keys when it comes to hardware. “Through these chips you have a way to interact without an arbiter,” stated Cameron, an early contributor to Kong Land. By addressing individual ownership at the hardware level, these chips can then be embedded in virtually anything, for secure access to digital assets and digital lands.  Kong Land intends to do this through “silicon locked contracts” (or SiLos) to address digital and physical asset ownership at the hardware level. SiLos are low-cost, durable, secure element microchips that are cryptographically linked to a smart contract on a public blockchain. Each chip self-generates a cryptographic key pair and the public key is added to a Kong registry contract.  Using a smartphone, anyone can scan the microchip using a near-field communication (NFC) reader, to verify the private key and unlock access to the tokenized assets stored in the contract, authenticate an identity, or even trigger real-world actions. Embedding a SiLo microchip into any physical item transforms it into a crypto asset that can be verified on chain, as well as interacted with in real life.  “While traditional tech companies focus largely on bringing users into virtual worlds or augmenting reality with digital experiences, we envision a seamlessly intertwined metaverse that doesn’t rely solely on wearable headgear,” says the Kong Land “ambassador” in a blog post.  The goal is to digitize real-world assets with these secure element chips that match physical and digital goods. NFTs enable verified ownership of assets to port between the physical and digital, and back to physical (they assure me that this final step is hard), as well as genuine ownership of assets for interoperability between metaverses.  One example is “Metafactory,” a “digital factory” for merchandise that is integrated with Kong Land microchips. This allows clothing items to be scanned by the NFC chip reader in a smartphone, to reveal an NFT and share metadata about the item.  In the future, Kong imagines people being able to take NFTs and digital items, and port them back to physical representations through chips, which verify ownership of unique assets.  Another example is “Kong card” passports, a physical passport with a chip embedded that allows “citizens” of Kong Land to verify their citizenship at physical locations for access to special events. Provability of unique identity with the passport then solves problems back in the digital crypto state, such as the challenge of multiple fake identities to attack a network (known as “sybil attacks”), which can be a problem in governance voting.  Read more: Why Barbados’ Metaverse Embassy Matters  “Like any other country, Kong Land has citizenship requirements, a unique culture, a working government (a “DAO of DAOs”) and a robust economy built on creating and exporting SiLo-factured crypto assets,” says the project blog.  Kong Land’s vision is to be a “DAO of DAOs” with an orbit of “sub-DAOs” that integrate microchips for anything they can imagine, effectively catalyzing a constellation of open metaverses. With the chip manufacturing hub at its core, Kong’s ambition to export their own secure element chips and eventually custom silicon research and development, this crypto-state competes with Facebook’s vision of a closed metaverse.  Conclusion  The rapid experimentation of blockchain-based DAOs as crypto-cities and states is demonstrating innovative ways to link the digital and the physical. Fundamentally, the battle between an open, decentralized, crypto metaverse and a closed, extractive, corporate metaverse comes down to the hardware, as to how people will access digital worlds. Kong Land is an example of a crypto-state with the community, manufacturing capabilities and expertise to compete for an open metaverse.  As they develop, crypto projects that operate like states will compete with big corporates and nation-states as new political actors. As the distinction between physical and digital spaces continues to erode, the emergent battle for the future of the metaverse offers an important area of inquiry into the risks and opportunities of cyber-civilization. The crypto community will need to continue to emphasize the importance of open technical architecture and participatory governance to pursue its vision for “interdependence.”",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | RESEARCH | AR,Kelsie Nabben,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/11/23/crypto-states-will-compete-with-corporates-in-the-metaverse,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/df2f84b9cf57f558620fd168ab75ba87956fb619-2121x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411669,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glPLOb,1637698622,The ‘Bitcoin City’ Fantasy,"This past weekend, El Salvador President Nayib Bukele announced plans for the world’s first “Bitcoin City.” The municipality will be set up like a tax haven for wealthy crypto investors – no income, property, capital gains or payroll taxes, only a 10% value-added tax (VAT) – and pay for its keep partially by net-zero, volcano-powered bitcoin mining. Construction will be financed primarily by a $1 billion bitcoin bond issued on Blockstream’s Liquid network, a Bitcoin sidechain. Here’s how that may play out.  Bd. Buenos dias. A stream of sunlight filters in from the eastern window in the luxury co-op that I’ve taken up residence in. The building, like many others in “Bitcoin City,” which is situated on the Gulf of Fonseca at the southeastern tip of El Salvador, erupts from the ground like a lightning bolt – a jagged architecture in reference to one of the city’s primary benefactors, Jack Mallers’ Zap. There’s a remote control to lower the shades, but the batteries died ages ago and they’re hard to replace. Bitcoin is a battery, they said.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Today is the dedication ceremony of the Chapel of Jimmy Song, named for the bitcoin educator and patron saint of cowboy hats. It’s a modern church that towers above Satoshi Square, the central-most point of the city. From its bell tower, it’s said, you can make out the shadow of Solana Seastead, an experimental techno-kingdom floating 21 miles off the coast. We’re at war.  Announced at the height of 2021′s “supercycle,” Bitcoin City is now half the age of the eponymous Bitcoin network. It’s the first and most developed crypto city, which isn’t saying much. Construction has been scattershot and slow going – more of a result of the competing interests of the municipality’s primary backers than of its unique financing. But we’re learning on the fly. The bitcoin bond, immediately graded “junk,” actually paid for itself – early investors are still getting a coupon payment.  See also: Are El Salvador’s Bitcoin ‘Volcano Bonds’ an End Run Around the IMF? | The Breakdown  What to build? Where to build it? An overriding commitment to the ideals of decentralization and self-sovereignty, and a lack of faith in the local government’s ability to allocate resources effectively, meant it was up for markets to decide. But finding consensus over the use of scarce resources is hard when the rules aren’t hard-coded. There’s plenty of money, but limited space and no zoning laws.  Sure, there was a general architectural plan – a giant “b” bisects the city – but each building is a fiefdom of its own. People like it that way. Bukele’s government spent the proceeds of the $1 billion bitcoin bond to buy land and finance a conjoined, geothermal bitcoin mining facility and power station, but then the city mostly “decentralized itself out of existence.” That is, except for the state-run pet hospitals (it’s fine to throw the “Trojan horse” ruler a carrot).  Promised residential areas, shopping centers, restaurants, “everything built around bitcoin,” we live with what the market provides. Some things are prioritized. Housing is either high-end or tiny, stacked hexagonal pods. There’s a McCafe on every block. It’s probably easier to buy a second passport than groceries. When the digital economy is paramount, and the population mostly globe-trotters, not many businesses can remain going concerns.  Walking down the main thoroughfare of Bitcoin Boulevard, you’ll see holograms of Alexander the Great, Tony Robbins and Adam Back. There are a lot of figures who contributed to the city’s founding. A virtual projection of Bukele flickers outside City Hall, a neoclassical building cut out of orange and black stone. You can scan a QR code, deposit a satoshi or two, and he’ll tip his signature white baseball cap. Thanks for investing in the future.  See also: The Future of Bitcoin: 12 Scenarios From Bullish to Bearish  The whole idea of bringing in institutional dollars was shut down after Moody’s downgraded the country. The only firms willing to buy distressed sovereign debt were the true believers – but as Blockstream’s Samson Mow said onstage at the “Feel the Bit” conference in 2021 – there are plenty of whales. But they all want a return on their tax-free investments.  Although Bukele said, “Bitcoin City is committed to free and equal access to everything,” in practice that’s a little less true. Ideological libertarians may be willing to build a public library, but they’re less committed to public health care. The transient population, the limited VAT taxes actually collected and the lack of buyers for Salvadoran sovereign debt mean the country is living under austerity.  I may sound pessimistic, but that’s only because you’re still living with the fiat mindset. A truly fair economic system recognizes that inflation is the greatest sin, that taxation is theft and that governments are hedonistic machines with a monopoly on violence. An economy based on scarce money makes sense for a world with limited resources, contrary to the last century of American hegemony.  The startup cities that have been founded over the past odd decade present a new way for organizing the world. They treat citizens as customers, and what customers really want is a tax haven.

In a statement published on Monday, the IMF recommended that El Salvador narrow the scope of its Bitcoin Law and mentioned “significant risks” that bitcoin has for consumer protection, financial integrity and financial stability.  The report corresponded with an official IMF visit to El Salvador conducted in accordance with Article 4 of its Constitutive Agreement, which annually overviews the fiscal, monetary and external situation of its members.  The IMF said the announcement of a $1 billion bitcoin-backed bond made by President Nayib Bukele on Saturday was not discussed in joint meetings between government officials and the agency.  Although the IMF’s technical analysis did not include the bond announcement, the financial institution said El Salvador’s plans to buy more bitcoin following the bond issuance, along with increasing its bitcoin exposure, “will require a very careful analysis of implications for, and potential risks to, financial stability.”  According to the IMF, El Salvador’s public debt could escalate beyond 95% of its GDP by 2026 if the country does not implement “strong policy measures” to correct fiscal imbalance and ease constraints on growth. The debt figure did not include the bitcoin bond recently announced, the IMF added.  Among the measures to limit contingent fiscal liabilities, the IMF recommended El Salvador consider winding down the $150 million trust fund created to facilitate the exchange between bitcoin and U.S. dollars. It also recommended withdrawing public subsidies to Chivo Wallet, a digital wallet launched by the Salvadoran government on Sept. 7.  Regarding the country’s new payments ecosystem, the IMF said El Salvador must immediately implement “stronger regulation and oversight.”  It added that the Chivo Wallet should be required to safeguard funds – in U.S. dollars and bitcoin – “by segregating and ring-fencing reserve assets.”  The banking regulation, for its part, should add prudential safeguards such as conservative capital and liquidity requirements related to bitcoin exposure, the IMF added.

42396462,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT3bxN,1637695697,"Rari Capital, Fei Protocol Look to Overcome Bagholder Bias in Ambitious DeFi Merger","Last week, two major decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols proposed an ambitious merger that could create a lending and liquidity powerhouse.  Untangling the details of how to combine two decentralized entities, however, is proving to be a complicated affair.  On Nov. 16, Rari Capital co-founder Jai Bhavnani and Fei Protocol founder Joey Santoro each made a proposal in their counterpart’s governance forums: combine lending protocol Rari and stablecoin protocol Fei via a token merger agreed upon by each’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governance.  The joint protocols would immediately command over $2.4 billion in total value locked (TVL), provide a unique combination of stablecoin minting and money markets, and serve as a proof-of-concept for future DeFi mergers – a trend that was widely predicted to flourish at the end of 2020 but has largely failed to materialize due to inherent DAO complexities.  A DAO is a group of people on the internet using various tools to exercise governance decisions in a variety of areas.  Read more: xDai Wants a Gnosis Merger to Stay Relevant, but Some Tokenholders Are Crying Foul  In Fei and Rari’s case, a number of factors stand in the way, including a pair of investor communities suspicious of one another, a token exchange rate that is the subject of some scrutiny and a number of details at the “social layer” that requires mutual trust.  However, both teams believe not only that the merger is the best way forward for their respective protocols, but that they can also push it through.  “This is not a done deal, but the core teams are committed to this,” Santoro said in a Fei community call last Thursday. “A treasury swap’s not good enough. We want to be fully incentive-aligned to do this together, to build really powerful integrations that aren’t just surface-level, and that only happens when you’re working under the same token.”  Synergies  On a surface level, a merger makes natural sense.  The two protocols are already closely aligned. Many of Rari’s lending pools accept both Fei’s stablecoin, FEI, as well as the project’s TRIBE governance token, and this usage has allowed Fei to put its foot in the door of a stablecoin market largely dominated by USDC, USDT and DAI.  However, both teams believe a deeper integration could boost these synergies significantly.  Rari’s Jai Bhavnani framed the merger as one that could bolster Fei’s usage and simultaneously enable immediate liquidity in lending pools – an all-in-one combination of liquidity and utility as a service that few other protocols could match. Both teams declined to speak to CoinDesk, pointing instead to communication in public channels.  “The question should be, ‘How is this going to create a bigger entity than us staying independent?’” said Bhavnani on the community call. “Us verticalizing all of DeFi, products like FEI bootstrap becoming a priority – I think everyone should get hyped up for this, because it’s going to be a complete game-changer.”  In his post on Rari’s governance forum, Santoro said that Fei can help Rari solve oracle availability bottlenecks, and that both projects will encourage usage for one another, as well as for exotic, long-tail assets in the DeFi ecosystem seeking to bootstrap liquidity.  “As more pairs begin to form against FEI, the network effects grow for Fuse and FEI to list more assets and more pools with more utility for each,” he wrote. Fuse is a Rari protocol for creating permissionless money markets.  Community reaction  Before this vision can come to fruition, however, the teams need to convince token holders to vote for it.  In the hours after the proposals were first posted, the initial reaction from investors was decidedly mixed as each community expressed concerns the other could weigh token prices down.  As part of the proposal, Fei would issue TRIBE tokens in exchange for Rari’s RGT tokens at a $1 to $1 rate, as well as pay off Rari’s debts related to a previous hack.  Read more: Rari Capital Reports Exploit in ETH Pool; $15M Taken  “I want further discussion on this topic. I really love Rari, but I am not sure how I feel about assuming Rari’s hack liabilities,” wrote one user on Tribe’s governance forums.  Other Fei community gripes focused on the market cap for RGT relative to TVL compared with other lending protocols, potential TRIBE dilution and the rate of RGT/TRIBE conversion.  Likewise, on the Rari forums, RGT holders expressed similar concerns.  “This proposal is so heavily weighted towards TRIBE that this feels like a scam proposal,” wrote one investor.  However, many third parties came out in support of the merger, applauding both the natural match between the protocols and the ambition to attempt one of the largest DAO-on-DAO acquisitions in history.  The teams both said that initial mutual distrust from token holders makes sense.  “The gut reaction was, ‘My bags are great and I don’t want to mix them with any other bags.’ What we’ve seen is that neutral parties or people who hold both TRIBE and RGT are absolutely fucking stoked about this, and it’s people who have one or the other and don’t understand the other community – they’re asking hard questions and pushing back,” said Fei’s Santoro.  Likewise, Bhavnani framed many of the concerns in terms of bagholder bias – a term for when crypto holders grow overly fond of the assets they hold and often behave in a cultlike manner.  “Each of our communities are extremely cult-like – and that’s fucking awesome. People sharing their feelings, people sharing their concerns, that means these are strong communities that care about these things, and that’s the best thing a DeFi project can ask for at this stage,” the Rari founder said.  Bhavani said that both teams don’t want to “trivialize” concerns and that he hopes to work with both communities to rally investors around to the vision of a DeFi superpower.  Hierarchy and administration  Merging DAOs additionally comes with a number of questions concerning hierarchy, workflow and decision making.  When asked about who would serve as the leader or de facto CEO of the joint venture, both founders pushed back against the notion of needing a clear leader at all.  “I think that’s a really unfair question. Neither of us is running the protocol – it’s a DAO, and a DAO is going to be made of teams and different core contributors. It’s based on context and on token-weighted voting,” said Santoro.  In practice, DAO organizations without a leader can sometimes stumble – Synthetix founder Kain Warwick had to re-enter a leadership role for the synthetic asset protocol after stepping away earlier in the year.  Nonetheless, the teams argued that DAO incentive structures would be enough to ensure an orderly transition.  “We have this one financial instrument that value-aligns these two teams. Technically, we don’t even have to talk to each other – we just can keep our heads down and we’ll both be working to maximize value for the token,” said Bhavnani.  The best example of what that might look like in practice is MakerDAO. The stablecoin protocol disbanded its legal entity in 2021 and is now run by semi-cloistered core units.  In the absence of a unified vision, MakerDAO governance proposals are often hotly contested, however.  While to some that rancor may be a sign of dysfunction, some DAO experts say that disagreements – even heated ones – can be healthy.  “If there are disagreements, that’s governance – I think [Compound governance contributor Getty Hill] put it beautifully on a Compound governance call, ‘Votes are passing too much, too damn much,” said Santoro.  Details and decisions  While the initial proposals in the governance forums were short and to the point, a host of teams have stepped in to help flesh out the details.  “I think it’s a really novel idea for you guys to merge, and I was looking at this package of, ‘How does this work? What does this mean? How does this functionally occur?’” Hill, also the founder of crypto development lab GFX, said on the Thursday community call.  Hill noted that the merger requires a “lot of social consensus,” and GFX spent a day drafting a DAO merger agreement, filling out at a high level what was lacking in the proposals. The firm is now playing a key role in fleshing out the details of the merger.  “We’re just trying to fill in all the points that no one thinks of, doesn’t want to talk about, or aren’t addressed with what we think is the most neutral way to proceed. We’re just here to help this thing along,” Hill added  The team plans to make this template available to the communities as they look to move forward.  Likewise, Llama, a DAO tooling organization, has stepped in to address the pricing of the RGT/TRIBE token transfer.  In a post in both governance forums co-authored by a number of contributors, Llama founder Shreyas Hariharan proposed a dual transfer method: a 14-day time-weighted average price for RGT’s conversion to TRIBE, and a yearlong vesting “success token” that would allow holders to exchange RGT for TRIBE 50% above the TWAP price after a year.  Despite the many moving parts and dangling loose ends yet to be addressed, both founders continue to express optimism regarding the success of the merger.  Should all the complications be untangled, the end result could be the most successful instance of a DeFi merger to date – a key step in legitimizing DAOs as competitive organizational entities, and a possible template for consolidation in a notably fractured industry.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,Andrew Thurman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/11/23/rari-capital-fei-protocol-look-to-overcome-bagholder-bias-in-ambitious-defi-merger,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/670666faba78ec559f23e293790dab0342529de7-6878x4780.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42396460,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT3bwO,1637694493,OCC Wants Banks to Seek Permission Before Offering Crypto Services,"The U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) wants banks to be very sure they can provide crypto services before they do so.  The federal bank regulator published an interpretative letter Tuesday telling banks to be very clear they can comply with existing regulations involving stablecoins and other cryptocurrency services if they want to begin offering custody or node verification services.  The letter discussed three other interpretative letters issued last year under former Acting Comptroller Brian Brooks, which allowed banks to provide these services.  “This letter clarifies that the activities addressed in those interpretive letters are legally permissible for a bank to engage in, provided the bank can demonstrate, to the satisfaction of its supervisory office, that it has controls in place to conduct the activity in a safe and sound manner,” Tuesday’s letter said.  The OCC made waves under Brooks last year when it published an interpretative letter in July allowing banks to provide crypto custody services to customers.  Banks could provide both fiduciary and non-fiduciary services under the letter, which also noted that crypto custody would differ from custody services for other types of assets.  Later that year, the OCC also published guidance for banks that want to provide services to stablecoin issuers that hold stablecoins in hosted wallets.  The OCC also granted banks permission to operate nodes in blockchain networks in the beginning of 2021, should they want to, essentially comparing blockchain networks to ACH.  In Tuesday’s letter, the regulator said banks should seek permission before they begin offering any services in crypto.  “The bank should not engage in the activities until it receives written notification of the supervisory office’s non-objection. In deciding whether to grant supervisory non-objection, the supervisory office will evaluate the adequacy of the bank’s risk management systems and controls, and risk measurement systems, to enable the bank to engage in the proposed activities in a safe and sound manner,” the letter said.

Percentage Of Bitcoin Supply In Profit has Fallen Down To Just 85% As per the latest weekly report from Glassnode, the total BTC supply in profit has fallen down to just 85% this week, meaning that 15% of the supply is now in loss. The &apos;percent supply in profit&apos; is a Bitcoin indicator that highlights the share of the total supply that&apos;s currently in profit. The metric works by looking at what price each coin in the chain was last moved at. If this price was less than the current price, then the coin is said to be in profit. While if this price was higher, then the coin is considered to be in loss. If the indicator attains very high values (more than 95%), then a Bitcoin market top may follow soon. But if the metric&apos;s values are low enough (less than 5%), then a bottom could be formed instead.

42375793,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwBVJj,1637691950,Crypto Options Traders Turn to DeFi for Altcoin Bets as QCP Slings $1B,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) is fast becoming a preferred avenue to hedge smaller cryptocurrencies beyond bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) as leading centralized derivative exchanges like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Deribit remain fixated on the two market leaders.  Singapore-based QCP Capital, an early investor in the dominant centralized crypto options exchange Deribit and one of the top volume leaders on the platform, is now trading more than $1 billion worth of crypto options on DeFi platforms per month, according to the firm’s chief investment officer, Darius Sit.  QCP, which runs a book in excess of $2 billion across exchanges, over-the-counter platforms and DeFi, recently traded $1 million worth of options tied to the AAVE token with Ribbon Finance and $1 million in LUNA options on ThetaNuts Finance.  While these figures may sound paltry compared to the daily volume of $500 million or more in the bitcoin options market on centralized exchanges, they are significant for relatively smaller coins like AAVE and LUNA.  Options trades on AAVE price  AAVE is the 57th largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $3.6 billion and spot market daily volume of $250 million, according to CoinGecko data. LUNA, the native coin of Terra’s blockchain, ranks 14th as per market valuation. Leading centralized exchanges like Deribit do not offer option contracts tied to these coins.  “We bought AAVE calls at $360 strike price sold by Ribbon Finance on Nov. 12,” said Sit. He also serves as an adviser to Ribbon Finance and ThetaNuts Finance.  AAVE is the native token of decentralized lending-borrowing protocol Aave. The cryptocurrency was trading near $310 on Nov. 12 and changed hands near $274 at press time.  QCP also bought bitcoin and ether calls and ether puts via Ribbon Finance on Nov. 12, generating a notional volume of over $200 million, Ribbon Finance co-founder Julian Koh said in a Telegram chat.  “Covered call,” an options-trading strategy that leans neutral to bullish, involves selling out-of-the-money (OTM) call options – those with strike prices above the current spot price – while owning the underlying asset. A call option gives the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call buyer is implicitly bullish on the market and pays a premium to the seller for offering protection against a price rally.  Ribbon Finance covered call strategy  With Ribbon Finance, the covered call strategy is automated. Investors need to deposit their AAVE into the vault, which takes care of other complexities like selecting the appropriate strike level for selling the weekly option.  The vault sells weekly AAVE call options against 100% of deposits every Friday at 11 a.m. UTC in return for the premium (paid in AAVE) by buyers, mostly consisting of market makers. The premium received represents the yield from the strategy and is distributed to users in proportion to their deposits.  If AAVE expires below the strike at which the call is sold, the depositors retain the entire premium received. If the option expires in the money with AAVE settling above the call strike, the option buyer can purchase AAVE at the strike price, and depositors lose money.  DeFi options trading  By and large, the recently launched AAVE vault functions similar to Ribbon’s ETH and BTC covered call vaults discussed in depth in September.  Structured products offered by Ribbon Finance and other protocols like StakeDAO and ThetaNuts Finance yielding double-digit returns are becoming increasingly popular as returns decline from so-called cash and carry strategies.  “DeFi options vaults are the key to scalability for options and structured products on DeFi,” QCP’s Sit told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat. “We see this as the real DeFi 2.0 wave.”  Ribbon Finance has registered a volume of more than $2 billion since the launch of the first option vault in April, Koh said. ThetaNuts is planning to launch option vaults for BTC, ETH, ALGO, AVAX, LUNA, SPELL and several other cryptocurrencies on Dec. 3, protocol’s manager told CoinDesk in Telegram interview.",POSITIVE,AAVE | BTC,AAVE | ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/11/23/crypto-options-traders-turn-to-defi-for-altcoin-bets-as-qcp-slings-1b,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d26f3a2c17b2da9c6693bb6c8a7e3bb24d5aa87f-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to the report, KurePay will officially stop providing services to Nigerian users in the first quarter of 2022.  In February, Nigeria’s central bank ordered the country’s banks to close accounts associated with crypto activity. The CBN later clarified that the order was not new, citing a circular from 2017.  It is unclear whether accounts tied to KurePay users were also affected by the recent orders.  According to the report, KurePay plans to restrict its business to over-the-counter (OTC) and consulting services for Nigerians, while new users are not encouraged to use the platform for now.  KurePay CEO Abikure Wisdom Tega reportedly said the CBN’s crackdown on crypto is a “disservice to Nigeria,” adding that KurePay has plans to launch a U.S.-based platform “in order to innovate in a more business-friendly environment.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/11/23/nigerian-payments-app-reportedly-suspending-operations-due-to-government-crackdown-on-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f6e52e58f7f84cf215e5db3aeca7e878fbb88426-1000x670.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411154,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gj7kyp,1637690099,Axie Infinity Finds Ready Players in Hyperinflation-Racked Venezuela,"Juan Tirado, 32, is unemployed and lives with his family at his in-laws’ small home in Maturín, the capital of Monagas state in Venezuela. He earns his living by playing the cryptocurrency-powered video game Axie Infinity every day from his mobile phone.  “Being able to play Axie has helped me pay off years of debts and cover not only my own food expenses, but for my daughter, too,” Tirado said in an interview in Spanish via Discord.  Venezuela is in its seventh year of recession, with a minimum wage around $2.40 a month and the highest inflation rate in the world. That’s why locals like Tirado are forced to look for alternate ways to feed their families and pay the bills.  That also explains why Axie, a metaverse “play-to-earn,” animated-pet-training video game inspired by Pokemon but fueled by cryptocurrency rewards, has surged in popularity over the past year in the South American country.  The game’s capacity to generate earnings for individual users has drawn headlines for its widespread adoption in the Philippines, where some of the world’s poorest people have found a supplemental or primary source of income from their daily playing. Authorities there have even discussed taxing players, thanks to the game’s popularity.  So the surging adoption of this game by Venezuelans might show how readily these crypto-powered games could find fresh audiences among populations racked by soaring inflation, shrinking economies and the daily struggle to make ends meet.  Venezuelan hyperinflation  According to traffic-monitoring data from SimilarWeb, the second-highest number of Axie players in the world are in Venezuela, after the Philippines but ahead of the United States, Argentina and Brazil. Axie has about 2.5 million daily players around the world, according to officials at Sky Mavis, the owner of Axe Infinity.  Axie Infinity is popular in Venezuela because its similarity to Pokemon is familiar to millennials, said Angelica Valle, ecosystem lead in Mexico for Celo, a platform that makes decentralized financial applications accessible on mobile phones. Valle hasn’t worked with Axie in Venezuela but she’s familiar with it because she works on initiatives to help Latin Americans adopt cryptocurrencies without government intervention.  “Venezuelans don’t think about it in terms of crypto,” Valle told CoinDesk in an interview. “They think this is a game and see it as a means to earn money.”  Given the complicated economic situation in Venezuela, Axie Infinity’s method of letting people earn money by playing offers an attractive alternative to citizens to signing on to low-wage jobs to overcome the nation’s hyperinflation.  Venezuela has the highest annual inflation rate of any country, according to the World Bank. The inflation rate decreased to 1,575% in October from 1,946% in September, according to data from TradingEconomics. It makes the latest 6.2% inflation reading in the U.S. – with the fastest growth in three decades – look tame.  “Axie empowers Venezuelans to make money in crypto rather than their broken currency,” said Carlos Betancourt, founder of BKCoin Capital, in an interview with CoinDesk.  Axie ‘scholarships’ in Venezuela  In Venezuela, where the minimum monthly wage is so low, the initial price to play Axie is high.  To get started, Axie Infinity requires users to buy (or borrow) three Axies. Currently, the average price per Axie is around $355, according to DappRadar. At that price, starting the game costs around $1,065 to form a team of three players.  For this reason, the Axie community has created “scholarships” – not in the traditional sense of educational grants, but a way of staking players who don’t immediately have the cash for the startup costs. Through these scholarships, Axie owners lend their Axies for a cut of the tokens earned.  To apply for a scholarship, people join Axie scholarship-related Discord or Telegram groups, where users publicize when they have openings. Others go directly to websites such as Axie University 101.  In future a lot more Latin Americans will be playing Axie as its popularity spreads beyond those on scholarships or those who are interested in gaming, Celo’s Valle predicts.  “Soon, doctors, economists, engineers will be playing the game,” said Valle.  It’s a bold prediction, but plenty of actors are working to make it happen.  Block Esports, a startup based in Venezuela that claims to be the first Spanish-speaking Axie Infinity team in LatAm, lends its Axie teams out through a scholarship process. Depending on the player’s ability, Block Esports offers a 60%-70% cut to the players. Put another way, Block Esports takes a cut from players’ earnings in exchange for loaning their teams to players based on their performance in the game.  Axie Infinity has two utility tokens, smooth love potions (SLP) and Axie Infinity shards (AXS), which can be converted into cash. Most players earn by farming SLP, which are required to breed new Axies.  “Some of our players use their Axie earnings to put food on the table,” said BlockEsports founder Luis Lozada in an interview with CoinDesk. “Others use it to pay for tuition fees.”  Players must have access to the internet in order to enroll in the scholarship program with Block Esports. This is a significant hurdle for some in Venezuela. Where Tirado lives in Monagas, only 14% of people have access to the internet.  Tirado plays Axie Infinity through a scholarship from Block Esports. He discovered it by joining the startup’s Discord group. The startup eventually reached out to Tirado with an offer to play.  He uses the money he makes from playing Axie to meet medical expenses for himself, his wife and his daughter, he said. In the past, he has struggled to cover those costs.  “I earn the same wage and sometimes more from playing Axie as others I know do by being a lawyer, doctor or engineer,” said Tirado. He acknowledges that he finds it very stressful playing Axie. Just like a lot of jobs.  “Personally I have many sources of stress. It is not just this game. I must learn to cope,” said Tirado. “I must learn in order to be able to play well, but also to stop it from affecting my daily life.”  Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, tweeted on Sept. 6 on its Binance Spanish account that it would offer scholarships for Axie players. Binance’s model allows users to be the total owner of Axies and profits, whereas most scholarship providers only loan users a team to play.  Axie in the developing world  According to Axie co-founder Aleksander Larsen, some 50% of users worldwide have never used crypto before and 25% have never had a bank account.  “The [coronavirus] pandemic definitely played a role in the surge of Axie Infinity’s adoption in certain countries, as people looked for alternative ways to make money during a time of financial hardships,” Larsen said in an interview with CoinDesk.  During Token2049 in London, one of the largest annual digital asset events, Larson said he’d like to implement an “education system” on how to play the game for unbanked people across the world, and teach them how blockchains and private keys work.  Whether Axie infinity will reach a wider audience in developing countries remains an open question. Given that users must have a mobile phone or computer access, an established Axie team or a scholarship opportunity, it could be unlikely.  ‘Economic freedom’ via crypto gaming?  Betancourt, founder of BKCoin Capital, a digital-asset hedge fund, is optimistic. He said the play-to-earn game will spread and offer economic freedom to Venezuelans.  Betancourt is a Venezuelan who lives in New York City. He said he is interested in helping people in Venezuela “make a living,” arguing that they’ve been suffering due to the current regime’s economic policies. He thinks people will be helped even more through crypto gaming because it will force younger people to educate themselves about the new digital financial world.  “Even Venezuelans from the lowest socioeconomic backgrounds will figure out a way to make it happen. Just wait,” said Betancourt.  Betancourt uses the example of a 17-year-old Venezuelan he knows named Sebastian. The teenager plays Axie Infinity through a scholarship program. He keeps 70% of his earnings and the rest goes to his scholarship manager.  Risks of play-to-earn  Play-to-earn games can be high-risk because of price volatility. SLP can be used to breed new Axies but SLP also has its own secondary market. So gamers’ “earnings” potential could take a hit.  SLP’s price reached an all-time high of about 40 cents in July and has since dropped by 83% to about 7 cents, according to CoinGecko.  However, many Venezuelans may see that volatility as minimal because they face risks that are far greater in their daily lives, according to Betancourt.  “The risk is falling deeper in the hands of an economy that’s been beaten up purposely by the regime, which clearly shows no sign of improvement,” he said. “This game will likely allow some folks to be able to put food on their table.”  Besides the Philippines and Venezuela, Axie Infinity has become a significant source of income for people in other developing nations, including Brazil and Vietnam.  Larsen, the Axie co-founder, said the game’s early community was mostly players in the Western world with knowledge of crypto. The game has since been spreading to the developing world, said Larsen.  That Axie Infinity has amassed 2.8 million players around the world shows how quickly monetary rewards in the form of cryptocurrencies could reshape the gaming industry.  “The explosive growth is a testament to the fact that a 100% player-owned, real-money economy is the way forward for the games industry,” said Larsen.",POSITIVE,AXS,AXS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/11/23/axie-infinity-finds-ready-players-in-hyperinflation-racked-venezuela,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b0c2c08618816da2e158ca69e8a07fc6230bb8c6-4082x3061.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

With the introduction of cryptocurrency to the gaming sector, a new model of gaming has emerged called the Play-to-Earn model. The Play-to-Earn model, as the name suggests, is designed to help players win various cryptocurrencies, NFTs, or other digital assets by playing in the game. As one can imagine, the P2E model became an instant hit because of the ability to win in-game assets and several exciting prizes. The growth of the P2E Market was significantly boosted during the pandemic as people struggled with a steady income. The lucrative and rewarding P2E games helped people generate a stable source of income doing what they love.

42411642,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glPLyy,1637687238,What’s the SEC Saying About Crypto?,"Ramping up  The narrative  Key U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) officials mentioned enforcement around crypto projects earlier this month: Chair Gary Gensler and Director of Enforcement Gurbir Grewal.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Why it matters  We’ve spent literally years interpreting statements from SEC officials to determine how the agency might approach crypto. This month, Gensler and Grewal mentioned crypto in the context of enforcement actions, which might just be a coincidence, but could also be a signal for those looking for more concrete action.  Breaking it down  SEC Chairman Gary Gensler spoke to the Securities Enforcement Forum at the start of the month, quoting SEC predecessor Joseph Kennedy on “making war without quarter” against those who violate federal law.  This ideal holds today, according to the current head of the agency.  “We will continue to pursue misconduct wherever we find it. That will include the hard cases, the novel cases and, yes, the high-impact cases – whether in special purpose acquisition companies, cyber, crypto or private funds; whether accounting fraud, insider trading, or recordkeeping violations. I know, recordkeeping violations might come as a surprise. While these may not grab the headlines, the underlying obligations are essential to market integrity, particularly given technological developments,” Gensler said.  Grewal, the relatively new enforcement chief, similarly mentioned crypto in comments made as part of a keynote address.  “But these days, most often in the context of crypto matters and our investigations of certain ESG – or environmental, social, and governance – related products and services, we hear that we should avoid ‘regulation by enforcement,’” Grewal said.  I’m not really sure whether these mentions are now cursory, included because everyone’s talking about crypto these days, or if they’re part of a broadening effort to encompass crypto in the SEC’s work.  What I do know is we’re seeing piecemeal actions from the agency against various crypto projects, mainly alleged frauds or alleged securities registration violations. There still isn’t any binding or bright lines guidance on what startups should do if they want tokens to be a significant part of their projects.  To be clear, we should distinguish between crypto projects that are (a) blatant money grabs designed to defraud people, (b) projects that make a legitimate effort to accomplish their goals and cannot due to technical or circumstantial reasons beyond their control, and (c) projects that actually succeed at their goals, at least for the purposes of this column.  The SEC has mostly focused on categories (a) and (b).  Agency officials often say they want to encourage innovation – in his Nov. 8 remarks, Grewal said the SEC welcomes new tools for capital formation. Still, he included the equally common warning that securities should be registered.  “But – equally importantly – all securities offered or sold to U.S. investors – regardless of their form or name – must comply with the U.S. securities laws.

As a result, the agencies have developed a crypto-asset roadmap that is summarized below,” the document said.  Over the next year, the group plans to “provide greater clarity” on whether custody, purchase/sale, loan, stablecoin issuance and holding crypto assets are legally permissible for regulated institutions, and how banks should comply with laws if so.  “The agencies also will evaluate the application of bank capital and liquidity standards to crypto assets for activities involving U.S. banking organizations and will continue to engage with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision on its consultative process in this area,” the document said.

Major telecommunications companies are showing an interest in partnering, she said.  GIANT’s plan is no less ambitious than any other crypto connectivity startup.

42375796,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwBVQ1,1637679210,"Indian Government Submits Bill to Ban Most Cryptocurrencies, Dashing Hopes for Friendlier Measure","The Indian government is still seeking to ban most cryptocurrencies under a long-awaited cryptocurrencies bill that will be submitted for consideration at Parliament’s so-called “Winter Session” this year.  According to a bulletin posted on Lok Sabha, the Indian parliament’s official website, The Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021, aims to create a framework that would facilitate the creation of a central bank digital currency (CBDC).  “The Bill also seeks to prohibit all private cryptocurrencies in India. However, it allows for certain exceptions to promote the underlying technology of cryptocurrency and its uses,” the bulletin said.  Crypto prices tanked on Indian crypto exchanges after the bill was announced. Bitcoin fell more than 13% on WazirX, while shiba inu and dogecoin both fell more than 15% in the hours after the revelation. These price moves were limited to Indian trading platforms however, with the price of bitcoin staying in the green on non-Indian platforms.  While the measure appears to be essentially the same as the draft bill submitted in January, it is unclear whether the two are identical since the latest draft is not yet publicly available. However, expectations had grown in recent months that the government had potentially softened its view on crypto and would perhaps seek to have cryptocurrencies regulated as assets instead of a means of payment.  “[The latest bill] is a mystery as it was never made public. So it’s hard to know but from what we know this can be an amended version of the initial banning draft that was introduced by the IMC committee headed by Subhash Chandra Garg,” said Aditya Singh, co-founder of Crypto India, an Indian YouTube channel with around 200,000 followers.  Singh added that although the title and description of the draft bill look identical to the one looking to ban all private cryptocurrencies, there is a “high probability” that the contents had changed. Singh cited India’s Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s recent statement that the government will not move forward with a blanket ban on crypto as an indication that the bill may have undergone some changes.  According to a video report by local news publication India Today, crypto trading is likely to continue under the proposed bill as long as users buy from crypto exchanges that meet certain requirements. The report said that the bill might focus more on restricting who is allowed to create or issue new cryptocurrencies with the aim of protecting investors.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), its central bank, is known to have conservative views about crypto. India’s supreme court overturned a crypto trading ban imposed by RBI for two years in March 2020, and the central bank initially planned to fight the ruling. Last week, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said the central bank has “serious concerns from the point of view of macroeconomic and financial stability” and that blockchain technology can thrive without cryptocurrencies.  As the government bulletin indicates, the framework seeks to pave the way for an RBI-issued digital currency. Earlier this month, local media reported that RBI is hoping to pilot a CBDC in 2022.  Meanwhile, earlier this month, the Indian government seemed to ease up on crypto, hinting that it would take a more progressive and forward-looking approach to digital assets. But last week, India’s prime minister Narendra Modi said in a speech that, “It is important that all democratic nations work together on this and ensure it does not end up in wrong hands, which can spoil our youth.”  Despite indications that the bill seeks to ban the use of private cryptocurrencies, Nischal Shetty, founder and CEO of WazirX, one of India’s leading crypto exchanges, sees the bill as progress, and called it a “big moment” for India.  “From a banking ban in 2018 to listing the Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021 in the Parliament’s winter session. Our nation has come a long way in these three years!,” Shetty said in a written statement.  Singh had a more tempered reaction to the proposed bill, saying the Indian crypto community feels the bill “will be a progressive bill as compared to the previous one but how progressive we will have to see.”  The Parliament’s Winter Session is expected to kick off at the end of the month.  UPDATE (Nov. 23, 18:01 UTC): Updated with additional information and background throughout, and notes that the new bill may be, but is not definitely, the same as the draft submitted in January.

Ardana received a grant from Near to build a crosschain bridge between Cardano and Near, per a press release provided to CoinDesk.  “Near’s vision always envisioned a multi-chain world, whereby each blockchain could seamlessly talk and exchange data between one another,” said Near Foundation CEO Erik Trautman in the release.  As multiple Ethereum alternatives gain steam, crosschain bridges are becoming an increasingly important infrastructure tool enabling cryptocurrency traders and yield farmers to pursue opportunities across the growing decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape.  Bridges are even emerging as an investable standalone vertical, with a funding round in October for Symbiosis and another in September for LayerZero.  The new bridge is also notable for connecting two blockchains poised to make a run at the total value locked (TVL) leaderboard. TVL is the amount of money invested in a DeFi product.  In October, Near announced an $800 million grants program – among the largest of the mammoth incentive programs layer 1s have been offering up in a bid to attract developers. Earlier in the month, Aurora – a platform enabling the Ethereum Virtual Machine smart contract execution environment on the Near blockchain – raised $12 million.

Oversight is needed for stablecoins, because they are now a “systemically important asset” with a market value of around $141 billion with a quarterly transaction volume of over $1 trillion in 2021, the bank said.  Despite the size and growth of the market, stablecoin issuers aren’t regulated under a sweeping framework and “provide varying levels of transparency into the composition of reserves that back their stablecoins,” BofA said in its report.  The Treasury Department’s report notes that the “potential for rapid stablecoin growth creates systemic risk” as “digital assets and traditional financial markets are more connected than many realize.” The stablecoin report recommended that the U.S. Congress pass legislation swiftly to integrate stablecoins into the banking system, allowing for federal oversight.  If regulators decide that all stablecoin issuers are required to be insured depositories, it could lead to banks issuing their own stablecoins, Bank of America added.

This problem resulted in the loss of thousands of dollars, and it is still causing the loss of more. Imagine the joy on people&apos;s faces when Telos, a popular third-generation blockchain, announced their new EVM that claims to solve this problem and many more. Yes. Just what you thought. Hope at last! But before we get a little too delighted, let&apos;s get a clear picture of how Telos will solve this problem and outperform other systems. Telos EVM was created to solve problems faced by other EVMs. Each part of Telos EVM seems to fix different problems common in other networks. Telos EVM works just like Ethereum, but it&apos;s different from the original EVM. The platform was built to host a large number of programs from other networks without having to modify anything. Even though Front running is very common in the crypto world today, and it&apos;s why many people lose millions of dollars, not many people know about it. That&apos;s because it happens without them even knowing. Front running happens when bots or miners with insider knowledge about pending trades make a profit off it. The involved individual can skip lines, complete transactions, and then tak...",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/company/telos-launches-its-very-own-evm-and-combat-front-running-in-crypto-market/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

42375811,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwBVf7,1637657081,Bitcoin Still Trading in Bullish Channel Despite Price Support Break,"Bitcoin’s broader outlook remains constructive despite the recent pulldown. The cryptocurrency fell below its support level of $57,653, the Oct. 23 low, which has opened the doors for a deeper pullback.  “There has been an 18% drawdown [from record high], but we have been here several times before, in September and June this year,” Lennard Neo, head of research at Stack Funds, told CoinDesk in a WhatsApp chat. “Bitcoin is still trading within the upward channel.”  MintingM, a Mumbai, India-based crypto asset management company, said that the cryptocurrency is still in a clear uptrend, making higher highs and higher lows on the daily time frame. As seen in the chart below, the upward or bullish channel, representing higher highs and higher lows, can be identified by trendlines connecting the lows of July 20 and Sept. 29, and the highs of June 30 and Sept. 7.  Bitcoin was trading near $56,000 at press time, having hit a record high of $68,954 earlier this month.  “There hasn’t been any strong catalyst to propel bitcoin’s price forward, and whales [large investors] have not been accumulating like they did in previous bull runs – which paints how global macro uncertainties have kept prices muted,” Stack Funds’ Neo said.  Matthew Dibb, Stack Funds’ chief operating officer and co-founder, said the recent decline represents a typical bull market correction and may extended further. “There is mounting concern that inflationary pressures will cause a drop in risk assets, including bitcoin. We believe it will happen at some point, but it is not exactly imminent,” Dibb said.  Action in traditional markets indicates potential for a deeper drawdown. The reappointment of Jerome Powell as chairman of the Federal Reserve by U.S. President Joe Biden on Monday reinforced bets that the central bank would hike rates faster to control inflation. U.S. stocks erased early gains, while gold and silver fell after Powell’s reappointment. The dollar index hit a 16-month high of 96.60 early Tuesday and the U.S. two-year yields rose to 0.63%, the highest since March 20.  Bitcoin flipped from support at $57,653 into resistance, with a firm close under the said level on Monday. And the breakdown is backed by a below-50 or bearish reading on the relative strength index (RSI), and so another leg lower cannot be ruled out.  MintingM said the immediate support is seen at $53,000, while Stack Funds’ Neo cited $50,000 and $51,000 as key support zones.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/11/23/bitcoin-still-trading-in-bullish-channel-despite-price-support-break-analysts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/20e7c5d55b5002b828cf29484258404f7ee1cc35-1480x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

There are several noteworthy projects in these areas expected to gain traction in 2022, so it&apos;s worth following them. We can also expect several new projects to emerge on the scene and shake things up. Here are some coins to watch headed into 2022. The 3 Altcoins Ready For 2022 Solana (SOL) One of the strongest altcoins in 2021 that went silent recently but can be expected to have steady growth in 2022 is Solana. It is built on a proof-of-history (PoH) consensus mechanism which allows the network to be more energy-efficient relative to many competitors. While many standard blockchains rely on a sequential production of blocks that require confirmation across the network, PoH allows validators to compute the state of the network from the ledger itself. The Solana protocol can depend on its own internal clock and sustain a throughput of more than 50,000 transactions per second. An under the radar coin that has started gain attention this year, this coin has seen an astronomical rise in the past few months. This could come from the several prominent dApps operating on the Solana network in the fields of DeFi, e-commerce, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and gaming.

After years of decentralized operations, Binance is set to settle down on a global head office to ease compliance woes. Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, founder and CEO of the world’s largest crypto exchange, said on Nov. 19 that Binance had picked a location for its HQ.  Binance set up three companies in Ireland in September: Binance (APAC) Holdings, Binance (Services) Holdings and Binance Technologies. The new entity is called Binance Exchange (Ie). In October, Zhao confirmed that Binance is considering Ireland for its global HQ to Reuters.  But in November, Zhao also disclosed his plans for offices in France, according to an interview with French newspaper Les Echos. “France would be a natural choice for a regional, and perhaps even global, head office,” Zhao teased during the interview.  Binance has been under regulatory pressure from authorities around the world, such as Japan, the U.K., and even crypto-friendly Singapore.  Ireland has been a favored location for European offices among U.S. big tech firms including Apple and Google, in part thanks to low taxes. However, Dublin will increase taxes for large multinational firms to 15% from 12.5%, the government decided in October.

42420821,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWYl81,1637639829,Kleiman v. Wright: Craig Wright Takes Stand Again in Final Day of Testimony,"MIAMI – Testimony wrapped up Monday in the federal trial of Kleiman v. Wright, with Craig Wright – who has claimed to be the creator of Bitcoin and the person behind the name “Satoshi Nakamoto” – taking the witness stand a second time since the trial began three and a half weeks ago.  His attorney, Andres Rivero, opened his line of questioning by asking, “Dr. Wright, did you form a business partnership with David Kleiman to invent and mine bitcoin?”  “No,” Wright said bluntly.  The trial pits Wright against the estate of his now-deceased friend Dave Kleiman. Kleiman’s surviving brother Ira claims that Dave helped Wright invent and mine bitcoin, that the two men had a business partnership and thus the estate is entitled to a portion of the bitcoin and intellectual property that allegedly resulted from that partnership. Testimony and evidence introduced during the trial focused on whether their relationship did or did not amount to a partnership.  While Wright has claimed to be the pseudonymous inventor of Bitcoin since 2015, his claim has been met by skepticism by much of the Bitcoin community. Thus far, he has never been able to prove that he has control over the bitcoin keys or addresses associated with Satoshi Nakamoto. The potential ownership of those coins is at the center of the plaintiff’s civil suit against Wright.  Read more: Kleiman v. Wright: Bitcoin’s Trial of the Century Kicks Off in Miami  Monday morning’s proceedings concluded the testimony of autism expert Dr. Ami Klin, who had begun testifying Friday. He said that Wright functions in social situations worse than 99% of the population and that “he gets very focused on the precise definition of words.”  ‘Electronic poker chip’  Wright then took the stand, with Rivero leading him though an overview of his childhood and education. Wright said his parents split when he was five and he did not see his father after age 10. He was close to his maternal grandfather, who had been in the Australian air force and would build ham radios. He said his grandfather had a lot of Japanese memorabilia.  Wright said he began coding computers when he was eight years old in 1979 and learned several coding languages. He said he earned multiple undergraduate and master’s degrees. He developed video games and did work for retailer Kmart and the Australian air force, then for gambling-related clients including MGM Grand and Lasseters Online Casino.  In 2005, the U.S. government cracked down on the use of credit cards, checks and bank transfers to pay debts from illegal online gambling. Wright said he began developing the idea of a token system for online gaming that would get around problems with international money transfers.  “A token is like an electronic poker chip,” Wright said.  Lasseters’ online gambling operation closed in 2007. In the meantime, Wright said, he had been working with botnets, with the file-sharing service Limewire and with peer-to-peer networks. He wanted to share just how resilient such networks could be.  “Rather than a single system, this was a distributed system so there were multiple nodes,” he said. It was more sustainable. If one company went broke, others could take over. “If one node goes down, it’s more profit for others. More profit attracts people,” he said.  Wright said he started to formulate this idea in 2006 and it coalesced in 2007.  Wright said he approached his then-boss at consulting firm BDO, Allan Granger, about collaborating on this. His legal team showed the court a document – notes from the meeting with Granger – with handwriting indicating that Wright would deliver a “doc” by October 2008. Satoshi Nakamoto posted the Bitcoin white paper on Oct. 31, 2008.  Read more: Why Are We Still Debating Whether Craig Wright Is Satoshi?  Wright said people including Hal Finney, Wei Dai, and Gavin Andresen helped refine his project by giving him fragments of code and helping him de-bug his project.  “Did you invite Dave Kleiman prior to 2007 to assist with the coding of bitcoin?” his attorney asked.  “No, he couldn’t code,” Wright said.  Conflicting dates  By March 2008, Wright testified, he had a handwritten version of what would become the Bitcoin white paper. He reduced that to a 40-page typed version, then a 20-page version, then a 10-page version, which is what he sent Dave Kleiman, he said.  On cross-examination, plaintiffs’ counsel showed that Wright’s testimony Monday contradicted what he’d said last week — when he testified he’d sent Dave Kleiman a version of the white paper that was “horrendously long.” They also contended his notes from his meeting from Granger couldn’t be verified with metadata, as they were handwritten.  Plaintiffs’ counsel also showed another contradiction: One of Wright’s email addresses was tied to the domain rcjbr.org. On Monday, Wright testified he’d created that domain, which combines the first letters of his wife’s name, his name and his kids’ names – on Oct. 27, 2011. He did not meet his wife until 2010. This detail implied he could not have written an email dated in 2008 from the rcjbr.org address to Dave Kleiman saying, “I need your help editing a paper … bitcash, bitcoin.”  In a 2020 video deposition of Wright played for the jury, Wright was asked about the same document: “Is this a real email?” He said he’d sent something similar around that time.  “Did you say/send these exact words?” he was asked in the video.  “It looks like … yes,” he answered.  Another apparent contradiction emerged Monday: Wright testified that he had mined bitcoin with computers in several locations in Australia and had additional servers in Tokyo and Malaysia. The plaintiffs then played a clip from a 2019 video deposition in which he testified he only mined in one Australian location, Bagnoo.  Read more: In Craig Wright Trial, Plaintiffs Lay Out Pattern of Fraud, Deceit and Hubris  Wright’s motion denied  Also on Monday, federal Judge Beth Bloom issued an order denying a motion by Wright’s legal team to essentially pre-empt the jury on seven counts.  On Nov. 16, Wright’s legal team filed a Motion for Judgment of Law, arguing that the plaintiffs had rested their case without providing the jury with enough of an evidentiary basis to find in the plaintiffs’ favor.  As the judge’s order explains, if “the court finds that a reasonable jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for the party on that issue, the court may resolve the issue against the party.”  Wright’s team claimed (among other points) that the plaintiffs hadn’t provided enough evidence for the jury to appropriately value the bitcoins and intellectual property that are at issue in the case.  Judge Bloom, however, wrote, “The Court is satisfied that the evidence presented at trial affords a sufficient basis for estimating the amount of damages with reasonable certainty. Specifically, the amount of [b]itcoin and its market price provide an adequate basis for the jury to calculate damages.”  Similarly, regarding the valuation of intellectual property at issue, the judge’s order pointed out that Wright himself had told the Australian Tax Office that the intellectual property that he acquired after David Kleiman’s death was worth $56 million, and had circulated a report estimating the market price for W&K’s software at $303,895,458. W&K Info Defense Research is one of the business ventures in which the plaintiffs allege Dave Kleiman and Wright were partners.  The parties will make closing arguments Tuesday.
