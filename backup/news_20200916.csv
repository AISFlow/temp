42432690,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO0pfh,1600288941,Bitcoin 'Young Investment' Wallets at Highest Level Since February 2018,"New investors are entering the bitcoin market at a faster pace and possibly creating upward pressure on prices, on-chain data shows.    The number of “young investment” wallets (those that are one to three months old and rarely send bitcoins) has jumped to 2,254,667 this month, the highest level since February 2018, according to data provided by the blockchain analysts firm Chainalysis. That's double from 1,162,632 six months ago.  The growth curve was much flatter in the first two months of the year but went near-parabolic following bitcoin's March crash.  ""It looks like new people are entering the market, buying bitcoin and putting it in wallets for long-term investment,"" Chainalysis' economist Philip Gradwell told CoinDesk.  Investors took advantage of the 40% price drop to levels below $4,000 observed on March 12 and have continued to pour money into the top cryptocurrency ever since.  ""Overall, the data suggests that buying pressure for bitcoin is increasing, and the supply available to buy is reducing as new purchases likely get locked up for the long term,"" Gradwell said.  Bitcoin is trading near $10,900 at press time, representing a 52% gain on a year-to-date basis, but still down 83% from the record high of $20,000.  The number of young wallets surged from 791,289 to 2,000,000 in the second half of 2017 as bitcoin rallied by $2,000 to $20,000.

Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $10,662-$11,099  BTC above its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bullish signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin hit as high as $11,099 on exchanges such as Coinbase Wednesday after the U.S. Federal Reserve announced it was keeping interest rates near zero until maximum employment is achieved. The price lost steam to $10,979 as of press time, however.

Read More: This Crypto Startup Takes Bitcoin Advocacy to a Whole New Level      At least one stakeholder remains wary until there is more buying volume in the bitcoin market, however. “Personally I think we need to see sizable purchase volume above $12,000 to really get this moving, otherwise I would tend to expect some more consolidation over the next few weeks,” said Neil Van Huis, director of institutional trading at liquidity provider Blockfills. The last time bitcoin hit $12,000 was back on Sept. 1.      Bitcoin mining could play a role in near-term market movements, added Van Huis. “If BTC prices are higher, miners may look to capitalize on it by selling to raise cash,” he said. The mining difficulty adjustment, expected on Sept. 19, is anticipated to trend higher since hashpower has been hitting record highs this week. That means older mining machines will be replaced with newer models in order for some operations to compete.      “Miners would essentially be speculating on whether it would be more profitable to just let their bitcoin holdings ride because they can’t get access to equipment, or sell BTC to raise cash for equipment to mine more efficiently going forward,” added Van Huis.      Italian over-the-counter trader Alessandro Andreotti pointed to the amount of bitcoin locked in decentralized finance, which crossed the 100,000 BTC mark this week, as a bullish sign for the world’s oldest cryptocurrency. “I think it is a great milestone for decentralized finance as a whole, showing how much potential it has and how many investors believe in it,” Andreotti said. “These are exciting times.”      Read More: Bakkt Bitcoin Futures Daily Trading Volume Hits Record High    Ether options bet below $400    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Wednesday trading around $365 and climbing 0.28% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).

While 36% expect ether to be over $380, only 22% of options bets expect ether over $400 next week at the Sept. 25 expiration.      William Purdy, an options trader and founder of analysis firm PurdyAlerts, said that ether’s implied volatility, the forecast of its price movements, has been higher than realized volatility, a measure of price movements from past behavior, since July. As option prices are based on implied volatility, he sees an opportunity in shorting ether options.      “The implied volatility is priced at a premium to historical volatility as ether investors are looking for downside price protection from future unfortunate events,” said Purdy. “This protection cost is often overestimated by the market and can be taken advantage of by selling options.”    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mixed, mostly in the red Wednesday.

42384669,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAl5Jd,1600272761,US Charges 3 With Vast 'Crypto Jacking' Computer Fraud Scheme,"U.S. prosecutors charged three Chinese nationals with allegedly mounting a global hacking campaign to steal sensitive corporate data from over 100 companies and installing a mass network of crypto-mining malware.      According to an indictment dated May 2019 and unsealed Wednesday, Jiang Lizhi, Qian Chuan and Fu Qiang ran their multi-year front out of the purportedly “white hat” Chinese cybersecurity firm Chengdu 404 Network Technology Co. They’re being charged with money laundering, conspiracy, identity theft and a raft of computer-related allegations, based on allegations they operated a vast crypto-jacking scheme and installed malware on victim computers, among other charges.      Chengdu 404’s “offensive” operations are what raised prosecutors’ ire. Their indictment outlines how Chengdu 404’s chief officers targeted at least 100 “victim companies, organizations and individuals” with a multi-year cyber scheme that employed “big data” analytics to maximize its impact.      Beginning in May 2014, the trio “conspired to commit a sprawling array of computer intrusions targeting protected computers belonging to hospitality, video game, technology and telecommunications companies, research universities, non-governmental organizations, and other organizations around the world,” according to the indictment.      They allegedly stole source code and customer data from the companies, deployed “supply chain hacks” to knock out customers’ own computers like dominoes, infected networks with ransomware and installed cryptocurrency mining malware to bolster Chengdu 404’s bottom line.      “The underlying common goal of the conspiracy was to obtain commercial success for CHENGDU 404 – and personal financial gain for members of the conspiracy – through computer intrusions targeting protected computers,” the indictment read.      The alleged perpetrators brought a hands-on approach to their crypto-jacking operations. As alleged in court filings, Jiang, the vice president for the Technical Department of Chengdu 404, told an unnamed fourth hacker to “get more domains to increase the computing power” of a Singaporean target. “Let's see how the profit is if we get a total of around 10,000 machines.”      Jiang allegedly advised the same hacker to sniff out French and Italian companies as potential targets, saying, “The only thing is that the time difference is a bit troublesome.

42384685,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAl5bF,1600272355,Blockchain Bites: The SEC's Chilling Effect on Crypto Development,"A slew of regulatory happenings are in the works. First, the Bahamian central bank plans to issue the first CBDC this October while the Indian legislative body is considering a ban on crypto trading.      Further, the latest SEC injunction into an allegedly unregistered token sale could set a grave precedent, argues Commissioner Hester ""Crypto Mom"" Peirce.    Top shelf    CBDC first The Central Bank of the Bahamas has confirmed it is moving ahead with the nationwide launch of its digital currency, called the ""Sand Dollar,"" sometime in October. Approximately $48,000 worth of the new central bank digital currency (CBDC) – pegged to the U.S. dollar-tracking Bahamian dollar (BSD) – will enter circulation initially with commitments to mint and remove BSDs as necessary. A mobile-based wallet app will also be rolled out. If it sticks to its October release, the Sand Dollar will likely become the first CBDC to launch anywhere in the world – it has been suggested China won't launch its own digital yuan initiative until the Beijing Winter Olympics in 2022, CoinDesk’s Paddy Baker reports.      ‘Chilling effect’ Online gaming and gambling platform Unikrn will pay a $6.1 million settlement – “substantially all of the company’s assets” – for conducting an allegedly unlicensed initial coin offering (ICO) in 2017, according to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The securities regulator said Unikrn’s $31 million fundraise was in violation of registration requirements, though Commissioner Hester M. Peirce has offered a dissenting opinion that the token startup wasn’t accused of committing any fraud. Further, this injunction will have a chilling effect on innovation on the part of other firms. Unikrn will continue to offer its services supported by major currencies, including fiat currencies, bitcoin (BTC), bitcoin cash (BCH), ether (ETH) and USDC, among others.      Leaked legislation A leaked legislative draft shows the European Commission is thinking seriously about aligning its oversight over the cryptocurrency and digital asset industry with standing regulations for traditional financial instruments. Europe’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) will provide legal certainty around crypto assets, though may also stifle innovation, CoinDesk’s Ian Allison reports. Europe’s MiCA is due this September, but will not likely be transitioned into European Union law until 2022 at the earliest. Siân Jones, senior partner at XReg Consulting, said the bill takes particular focus on stablecoins, which could affect development in projects as diverse as the multi-asset-backed Libra project and the nascent decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.      Another ban? India may ban cryptocurrency trading, according to a recent Bloomberg report. According to sources close to the matter, the federal cabinet is weighing a new bill that seeks to impose limits on trading activity, similar in function to a Reserve Bank of India ban that was repealed by the nation's supreme court in March. The news comes amid a flurry of crypto activity and as the government explores potential use of blockchain technology to manage land records, pharmaceutical drugs supply chain or records of educational certificates.      Similar standards Bank regulators in 48 U.S. states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico plan to make compliance for cryptocurrency companies simpler by consolidating supervisory exams. The Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS), a coordinating body for state regulators, said the new regime for money service businesses (MSB) will introduce the standards to streamline compliance and enable firms like Coinbase to work across multiple states, instead of going through the time and expense of getting regulated in each and every one, CoinDesk’s Paddy Baker reports.

Tuesday, MicroStrategy announced it has purchased $175 million more BTC over and above the $250 million worth acquired in August. The reason? Dollars are no longer a safe place for its excess cash.      This marks a pronounced turnaround for the chief executive who once called bitcoin fool’s gold.      “I went down the rabbit hole” during COVID-19, Saylor said, admitting he “was wrong” to have doubted bitcoin back in the $600 range. “I wish I knew then what I know now,” he said.      Led by the industry's most prominent public faces – Anthony Pompliano, Nathaniel Whittemore and Andreas Antonopoulos – Saylor realized that the age of quantitative easing and hot-headed inflation has left its mark on the dollar’s long-term future.      “This is not a speculation, nor is it a hedge,” said Saylor. “This was a deliberate corporate strategy to adopt a bitcoin standard.”      While this move does add legitimacy to the industry and the goals of creating a stateless, intervention-proof economic system, there’s reason to pause. MicroStrategy is just one among thousands of publicly traded firms. The whims of its executives hardly represent anything beyond its board room.      Then again, as money blogger and CoinDesk columnist J.P. Koning ironically noted: “Big announcement today about 16,796 bitcoins being sold for $175 million! CoinDesk interviews the sellers to find out why they are betting big on fiat.”    Market intel    Fed whisperer Bitcoin is struggling to clear the important psychological hurdle of $11,000. Analysts will watch closely for any changes in the U.S. Federal Reserve’s rate decision due today, where central bank heads will likely remain committed to letting the economy run hot for the next few years. CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reports there is a schism in how crypto markets could react, citing a tolerance of higher inflation as a bullish development for scarce assets like bitcoin and gold. On the other hand, BK Asset Management's Kathy Lien said the U.S. dollar may find buyers if the Fed is more positive on economic growth. In that case, bitcoin will likely face selling pressure.      Data buy Data provider CB Insights has acquired Netherlands-based Blockdata to bolster its cryptocurrency and digital asset intelligence. “It’s become something that our clients are increasingly talking about as big and practical,” CB CEO Anand Sanwal said. The terms of the deal were not disclosed.    Tech pod    Playing with DSL Discrete log contract (DSL), a form of “invisible” smart contract that became feasible on Bitcoin just this year, has gone live. Disguised as standard multi-signature transactions, DSL has been advanced by Bitcoin developer Lloyd Fournier and his work building “scriptless-scripts.” The principal use case will be betting, CoinDesk’s Colin Harper reports.      Online censorship The Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI) is allowing people around the world to monitor internet censorship and interference in their countries in a decentralized manner for free. It has created the world's largest open dataset on internet censorship, with millions of measurements collected from more than 200 countries since 2012, CoinDesk Privacy Reporter Ben Powers said.    Op-ed    How crypto can win Blockchain Association Executive Director Kristin Smith details how the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry can get its foot in the door of Congress. “The public policies that we need for crypto to thrive cannot be achieved if our industry is unwilling to unite and work with the government.

42384686,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAl5Zz,1600271618,Ecological Sanity Is Compatible With Human Freedom,"In the early days, Bitcoin proposed a simple model of how the world could be transformed: The free market was going to produce inflation-proof money with strong privacy features, which could be used to avoid taxes. Over time, people would sell their dollars, replace them with cryptocurrency and the State would wither away to be replaced with an anarchic paradise.    Vinay Gupta is CEO of Mattereum, an Ethereum-based physical asset management platform. He coordinated the Ethereum launch process and first worked in cryptocurrencies in the 1990s. This essay is part of CoinDesk's ""Internet 2030"" series exploring the ongoing digital revolution.    That was one Bitcoin theory of change. It seems improbable now, as it did before, despite the current risk of game-changing inflation in America. The ship may be going down, and Bitcoin may be a life-raft for some (as it is in Venezuela), but the collapse was not caused by Bitcoin. It was caused by good old-fashioned mismanagement over decades.      Bitcoin is an evolution. Even if it cannot replace the state, it has spurred a clandestine movement of believers. The next Bitcoin “theory of change” was remittances, banking the unbanked and creating economic opportunity at the bottom of the pyramid. Through the miracle of the blockchain, transaction costs could be slashed, allowing dollar-a-day laborers everywhere to start businesses with a $40 loan.      Progress has been slow. Know your customer (KYC) and currency controls weigh like an albatross around all efforts to bank the unbanked or diminish the state. Now it’s a little less clear how precisely blockchain will make a difference to our long-term planetary outcomes.      Still, given the waste and excess in society, it’s never been clearer how much the world needs cryptographic transparency. So what is our theory of change? How are we really going to get a better world out of all this exquisite technology?    Seeing the present    A senior military thinker I used to work for described the four phases of history thus: “boom, bust, protectionism, war” with an option to go from bust back to boom by radical economic reorganization. But even this cycle is running out of room: the weapons grow ever more devastating, and we’re losing climatic stability, and that means eventually running short of food.      If you want a world that has both liberty and enough to eat, you'd better put your thinking cap on. (Elon Musk is building those space ships for a reason.) We need solutions to multiple problems simultaneously. We need an elegant economy of action before impotent regulators and short-sighted markets ruin our world permanently.      My theory of change is to take the database state seriously and do what it is good at – tracking – and kick it into high gear. Solving the climate crisis and mitigating the ill effects of the state means making everything in the material world transparent.    Ecological sanity is compatible with human freedom, but only if we deploy cryptography to manage the resource allocation.    So we make matter a first-class actor in the global economy, and handle matter as carefully as we handle money.      Money, other than small change down the back of the couch, never just vanishes. Every penny created is tracked over its entire lifetime, and this is doubly true for a satoshi. We regard money as sacred.      Matter, on the other hand, is anonymous: As soon as you throw away that paper cup, it’s anonymous. Burners call this “moop,” short for “matter out of place.” We are literally drowning in moop: carbon dioxide, microplastics, endocrine disruptors, neonicotinoid pesticides. They go into the environment and they go into our bodies.      We trust regulators to protect us, but we can do much better than this.    Fixing the future    We have to get consumption down and efficiency up. First World lifestyles are producing around twice the sustainable level of carbon dioxide. Meanwhile, approximately 10% of humans live with permanent hunger. People like to say poverty is declining everywhere, but so, too, is middle class and working class dignity eroding.      People will bluff and bluster on all of this. Some will say “technology will fix everything,” others that we need some kind of mass spiritual awakening.      No. We need a revolution on par with the invention of money, the invention of financial instruments like stocks and insurance, the ongoing transfer of power to democracies around the world as enfranchisement spreads. Revolution need not imply smoke, fire and blood running down the streets. It simply means a change in how things are done at the most basic level.      See also: Vinay Gupta’s Big Idea: An Identity Layer for Your Things      We need to apply the same kind of precise thinking that we do about money to everything else. We have the computing power! Why should matter remain anonymous?      Sharing data is often against people’s commercial or personal interests, but that’s what cryptography is for: selective disclosure at managed cost.      The trick here is agency: If this database sits with Amazon or eBay, it’s the same problem as having your money sit in a bank that somebody else controls, or having your medical records locked to your health-care provider. If we want more meaningful agency, even sovereignty, in our lives, we have to be in charge of our own data, and able to regulate what algorithms see our data.      Blockchain is the missing technology in the transition to treating our matter as respectfully as our money. We have to build a more free society while being more data-driven and efficient than ever. So, we need to make sure that we own our own data, and that cryptography veils it in transit and at work.      See also: William Shatner Joins Effort to Fight Collectibles Fraud With Blockchain ‘Passports’      For many of the hardest problems we face, and I’m thinking mainly about ecology and modern slavery, technology only makes solutions possible: without the technology, we are stuck with the problem. But with the technology, we still have to do the work and share the pain of solving the problem.      Our freedom rests on our ability to use technology to dig our way out of this hole: to increase our options by creating and deploying new supply-side technologies to create clean energy, and by radically re-engineering the demand side to hit our necessary consumption limits.      The creativity of the market economy works, but instead of mere “price signaling” we need high-quality, multidimensional data so we can run a multidimensional market: money, carbon, other forms of impact, all inside of a single global budget, with infinite room for human creativity to prove we met our targets and live as well as we are able.      Neither utopian nor dystopian, this is reality: You have markets, or you have authoritarianism. Carbon is a new constraint, and we either handle it like money and instrument well enough for creative response or face a future of blundering mandates.      Ecological sanity is compatible with human freedom, but only if we deploy cryptography to manage the resource allocation. My hope is that, by 2030, these systems will be ready in enough countries that they’ll become standardized across the world, and we can go on together.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Vinay Gupta,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/09/16/ecological-sanity-is-compatible-with-human-freedom,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/29c6106c73e6ecb3b3b7a16220405a868b911f8a-1420x947.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Nicknamed HOPR Säntis (after a Swiss mountain) and running on the xDai chain, the firm says the testnet provides “fast transactions secured by proof-of-stake, while eliminating the high Ethereum transaction fees.” Transaction costs on the xDai network are lower than on the Ethereum mainnet.  Participants in the program will earn ERC-20 HOPR tokens for running a node. These tokens will be distributed when the HOPR mainnet launches in late 2020.  “We want to get people to run a node ahead of our mainnet launch later this year and already earn tokens for that,” HOPR lead Sebastian Bürgel said in an email to CoinDesk.  The incentivized testnet is also a chance to get feedback on the mixnet, detect bugs and generally take the network to the next level with a second round of feedback, following the firm’s initial public testnet this summer, according to Bürgel.  While HOPR sells its own hardware node version (at $440), a HOPR node can also be run on devices that run Windows, macOS and Linux.  The reason for using hardware rather than the cloud, said Bürgel, is that it’s better for decentralization as it doesn’t rely on cloud infrastructure.  In July, HOPR announced a $1 million funding round led by Binance Labs.

42384667,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAl5H7,1600266881,Kraken Becomes First Crypto Exchange to Charter a US Bank,"Kraken is the first cryptocurrency firm in the U.S. to become a bank.      On Wednesday, the Wyoming Banking Board voted to approve the San Francisco-based crypto exchange’s application for a special purpose depository institution (SPDI) charter. Kraken is now the first SPDI bank in Wyoming. According to the Wyoming Division of Banking’s general counsel, Chris Land, Kraken will also be the first newly chartered (de novo) bank in the state since 2006.      “By becoming a bank we get direct access to federal payments infrastructure, and we can more seamlessly integrate banking and funding options for customers,” said David Kinitsky, a managing director at Kraken and the CEO of the newly formed Kraken Financial. (Kinitsky has run Grayscale Investments, was the first digital assets hire at Fidelity and was most recently head of business development at payments startup Circle.)      In the wake of a July letter from the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency giving national banks the go-ahead to custody crypto, the Division of Banking also announced it has been working with Promontory Financial Group, a prominent Washington, D.C.-based consulting firm made up of lawyers and former government regulators. In October, the division along with Promontory will publish the first manual for banks regarding procedures and policies for handling digital assets, Land said.      In addition to more products, Kraken Financial will give Kraken the ability to operate in more jurisdictions, Kinitsky said. As a state-chartered bank, Kraken now has a regulatory passport into other states without having to deal with a patchwork state-by-state compliance plan.      Kraken has been silent about its application until now. The first hint the exchange was interested in the Wyoming charter was in December when it opened a position for the job Kinitsky has now.      “We would expect to offer a host of new products as we get established,” Kinitsky said. “Those will range from things like qualified custody for institutions, digital-asset debit cards and savings accounts all the way to new types of asset classes. We can engage with securities and commodities and things like that as a bank. So a lot more TBD there.”      Kraken expects its major revenue drivers to be fees and services, Kinitsky said. SPDIs are not allowed to lend, and each bank has to hold 100% of its assets in reserve. Kraken wouldn’t say how much equity capital the firm raised for its application, but the Division of Banking is encouraging applicants to raise between $20 million and $30 million, similar to the equity capital kept at a de novo bank.      Initially, Kraken Financial will play the same function as third-party banking relationships that Kraken has already formed, Kinitsky said. Eventually, the subsidiary will become the U.S. customer service provider, with Kraken affiliated services offered on the back end.      Read more: What It Takes to Get a Crypto-Friendly Bank Charter in Wyoming      Having received the charter, Kraken will focus on building out operations and personnel for the bank, aiming to have 10 to 25 department heads to start out, Kinitsky said. The exchange has hired its board and C-suite and expects to have the rest of its permanent hires in place by the end of the month.      The statutes undergirding the SPDI charter reconcile digital assets with the U.S. uniform commercial code by making the safekeeping of digital assets a bailment, which is the same legal relationship that valet drivers have to the cars they park, said Wyoming blockchain pioneer Caitlin Long. SPDI banks can hold digital assets but will never have legal ownership over those assets. This means that even if a SPDI bank goes bankrupt, those assets have to be returned to customers, whereas a trust company can have its assets claimed by a judge during bankruptcy.      Long has her own SPDI bank application underway, called Avanti Financial, which she expects to open in October with new bank-issued digital assets. She expects SPDIs to diversify the crypto banking sector, which has been historically underserved. The Division of Banking is currently working with six companies that are applicants or potential applicants for the charter, and each company could be chartered by the end of 2021.      Long also expects the SPDI charter to pressure crypto companies to offer proof of reserves to customers and the industry at large.      “SPDI banks have to provide a Merkle tree to their auditor so they can cryptographically verify that their reserves are there,” she said. “We have zero insight into whether the service providers are solvent or not and they’re not even audited in most cases.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/09/16/kraken-becomes-first-crypto-exchange-to-charter-a-us-bank,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6ab53b8cc2487b200d7d7ac3c9331fa8963e9813-1500x894.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384673,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAl5Pv,1600264931,Ava Labs Sets Avalanche Mainnet Launch for Sept. 21,"Another contender is joining the ring of decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms sparring to win market share from the Ethereum ecosystem.      Ava Labs is launching its Avalanche blockchain next Monday, Sept. 21. The upcoming launch comes on the back of $60 million in funding, $45 million of which came from a July 2020 public token sale and private sale lead by Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital, Bitmain and Initialized Capital.      “Avalanche aims to enable new systems defined by velocity, efficient use of capital, and innovation in new products and services that aren’t possible with the current wait times to finalize transactions,” Ava Labs CEO Emin Gün Sirer told CoinDesk. “DeFi is certainly part of our motivation in the short term, with our long-term sights set on traditional finance.”    Ethereum compatibility    Avalanche is a proof-of-stake blockchain that the team at Ava Labs claims can process 4,500 transactions per second even without the security tradeoffs usually associated with low-latency chains. Its novel consensus mechanism is a fusion of a directed acyclic graph structure and “repeated subsampled voting,” which Sirer called the “core innovation.”      The blockchain’s architecture consists of the primary network and so-called “subnets” – secondary, uniquely tailored blockchains that are supported by Avalanche’s main network.      These subnets can be curated for specific use cases and designed to fit the needs of their designers (they can be public or private, for instance). Avalanche validators, those who stake the network’s native token, AVAX, to process transactions, can choose to validate or ignore transactions from any given subnet. Sirer told CoinDesk that a minimum of 2,000 AVAX is needed to stake a validator node.      Avalanche documentation indicates some subnet validators may be subject to know-your-customer (KYC) requirements per their respective jurisdictions and may require licensing to operate.      Read more: Base Layer Wars Heat Up With Another $12M Committed to AVA Labs’ Avalanche Blockchain      Avalanche’s presumptive high throughput and flexibility are positioning it to compete for DeFi market share, the team claims, particularly at a time when transactions have choked the go-to DeFi network in Ethereum and sent its transaction fees skyward as traders compete for block space.      One of Avalanche’s primary marketing features is its Ethereum compatibility. One of its subnets, the Avalanche Contract Chain (C-Chain, for short), supports the Ethereum Virtual Machine and its Solidity coding language. This will allow developers to import and deploy Solidity smart contracts on the new network.      “Avalanche will also support bridges to other networks for users to move assets between the networks, including a bridge to Ethereum that we’ll be launching very soon,” Sirer said.    Another one rides the wave    Ava Labs is the latest project to dive headfirst into a surging, multi-billion dollar DeFi market, which is dominated by Ethereum. It joins other next-gen platforms like Solana and Anchor, which are positioning themselves as faster versions of older competitors like Ethereum.

Announced Wednesday, Polimec, the token issuance and transfer framework for Polkadot, is being launched by the team behind blockchain identity protocol KILT.      The reasons for creating a community-owned tokenizing system native to Polkadot are manifold, not the least of which are the surging gas costs associated with transactions on Ethereum blockchain, said Ingo Ruebe, CEO of BOTLabs and project lead for KILT Protocol.      Normally a startup project working on Polkadot might attempt to finance their runway by issuing an ERC-20 token on Ethereum that can be listed on exchanges. As well as removing the costs of transferring ERC-20’s around, the bigger picture for the Polkadot ecosystem is the explosive growth that having a standard to build tokens on top of brought to Ethereum.      “If you look at what ERC-20 actually did to the Ethereum ecosystem, then you can imagine what will possibly happen with Polimec,” Ruebe said. “It’s an absolutely essential part of the ecosystem, I would say.”      Read more: Polkadot-Based Acala Raises $7M as DeFi Grabs Land on Another Blockchain      Ruebe reckons Polimec will not only drive more people and projects onto Polkadot’s parachains (similar to sidechains but with a greater degree of independence) but will also cater to a large number of dot (DOT) holders who would welcome ways to invest these back into the community.      “If you bought dots at the public Polkadot sale in 2017 you have seen your investment grow by more than 10 times,” said Ruebe. “So there are many dot holders who would like to reinvest in Polkadot and make the whole community more valuable and attract more projects.”    DOT’s progeny    The KILT mainnet, which is slated to go live in around 11 months, will be the first project to mint tokens using Polimec. KILT uses blockchain-based identity and verifiable credentials across various industries including areas like IoT (internet of things). The startup is part of a government scheme in Germany, GAIA-X, exploring blockchain use cases, and is backed by German and Swiss corporates Huber Burda Media and Ringier.      Exchanges can also use Polimec’s transaction-based API to conduct IEOs or provide access to the transferable Polimec-issued currencies. Polimec is dependent on the parachain/parathread functionality for Polkadot, currently under development, and will launch when parachains are available, expected later this year.      “There have been rumors circulating around the developer community about Polimec and the word has reached some exchanges,” said Reube. “We are at the early discussion stage with three exchanges; I can’t name them but they are in the top 10.”",POSITIVE,DOT,BLOCKCHAIN | DOT | ETH | TOKEN SALE,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/09/16/polkadot-projects-will-be-able-to-mint-their-own-tokens-in-2021,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bb498079a58cef1845834daf0e7ab88c0a125611-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

DeFi trading platforms like Uniswap, Curve and Balancer have appealed to cryptocurrency traders with their low cost and ease of use, and they're now starting to steal a growing and no-longer-negligible share of market trading volumes from bigger, established exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, Huobi and OKEx.      These ""centralized"" exchanges – the term is sometimes tossed around with a sneer – are rolling out new business initiatives they describe as decentralized, in an apparent bid to cash in on the trend and stanch a further exodus of customers.      Huobi, a Chinese-led cryptocurrency exchange based in Seychelles, announced Tuesday it is adding 10 new members to its DeFi initiative, described as “a consortium of centralized and decentralized financial services providers.”      The announcement came just a day after Huobi's arch-rival, OKEx, which is also Chinese-led but based in Malta, said its OKExChain network was the most decentralized public blockchain powered by an exchange.      And last week, Binance, the world's biggest cryptocurrency exchange, announced an integration of its centralized trading platform with its decentralized public blockchain, Binance Smart Chain (BSC).

And OKEx CEO Jay Hao told CoinDesk in an email that “it’s impossible to ignore the compelling promise of DeFi, and we are firm believers that it will succeed.”      Charts of bitcoin held at big exchanges show declining balances over the past several weeks, and Simon Chen of the Hong Kong-based crypto trading firm Babel Finance says one likely explanation is that some of the cryptocurrency is getting transferred to DeFi.      In August, DEXs accounted for a 5% share of total crypto exchange volumes, according to a Sept. 14 report by the cryptocurrency-analysis firm Messari. The business is dominated by the ""automated market makers"" Uniswap, Curve and Balancer.      ""The exchange business has proven itself to be incredibly lucrative for crypto and automated market makers are starting to receive their slice of the pie,"" Messari analyst Jack Purdy wrote in the report.      Binance's CZ said he will be ""really happy on the day when decentralized exchanges replace centralized exchanges,"" at least partly because the company's BNB digital tokens ""will be worth much more.""      Su Zhu, CEO of the cryptocurrency-focused investment fund Three Arrows Capital, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message that centralized exchanges could still be a ""gateway to DeFi, but not where users ultimately spend their time.""

Freehold kicks off today by opening enrollment for the first cohort of Freehold evangelists. This program literally pays newbies – in bitcoin (BTC) – for studying and saving in their own wallets. Stanley compared it to the Mormon door-to-door missionary program, rather than crypto fans “talking to themselves on Twitter all day.”      “HODLing members will be incentivized to lead community-building initiatives, share educational resources, and participate in contests in exchange for rewards,” Stanley said. “I’m taking a hands-on approach to the initial onboarding.

In a job posting Tuesday, BIS said it is looking for a ""DLT/Blockchain expert"" to be the point person on its digital asset initiatives.  The successful applicant will have a computer science background, coding experience and a deep understanding of cryptography and distributed ledger technology.  Hired on a three-year contract, the person will join BIS' Innovation Hub in either Hong Kong or Switzerland to design, build and test initiatives up to proof-of-concept level.  BIS doesn't divulge what the new hire will be looking at, but the ad says this could include central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), digital securities and other token-based payment systems.  Crypto-critic Agustin Carstens, BIS' general manager, said last year that central banks were “not seeing the value” of issuing CBDCs, especially as they may affect financial stability and the monetary system.  BIC is now already working on projects to do with the tokenization and digitalization of the trade process, the description says.  The role will also include liaising and collaborating with central banks and other financial institutions on related initiatives.  The head of BIS' Innovation Hub, Benoit Coeure, a former European Central Bank (ECB) board member, has previously said blockchain is promising but cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin are too problematic to ever be considered for a mainstream payments method.

42384687,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAl5dl,1600258735,How Data Centralization Ends by 2030,"The next 10 years will witness the systematic manipulation of human life at a scale unrivaled in history. For all the recent controversies over privacy and surveillance, the real threat is ahead of us.      Unless new approaches to online identity and data management take hold, both governments and private actors will move inexorably from knowing you to shaping you. Blockchain-enabled decentralization will develop as the only viable response to the iron logic of data centralization.    Kevin Werbach is Professor of Legal Studies and Business Ethics at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, where he focuses on emerging technologies such as AI and blockchain. This essay placed first in the ""Decentralized Futures"" writing contest, organized by NESTA, a U.K. innovation foundation.    Blockchain believers often talk as though today’s early-adopter use cases, such as cryptocurrency trading and decentralized finance, will lead straight to mass market adoption. As the inevitable ‘killer apps’ appear, so the story goes, blockchain-based systems will conquer the mainstream. One might imagine that we’ll all soon be trading digital collectibles and relying on token-curated registries for accurate information. Governments will lose control over money, and blockchain-based smart contracts will replace court-enforced legal agreements. Uber, Facebook and the banks will wither away in the face of tokenized alternatives.      This narrative is wishful thinking. In most markets, intermediaries will endure for the same reasons they always have: they provide value. The Ubers and Facebooks – and yes, even the banks – tame complexity and produce coherent, convenient, de-risked experiences that no decentralized community can ever match. Early adopters use blockchain-based systems for ideological reasons or to get rich on cryptocurrency speculation. The billions behind them in the mainstream will not. The lock-in power of network effects creates high barriers for alternative economic systems. And the need for trust disqualifies decentralized solutions that are havens for criminals, incapable of effective compliance or vulnerable to catastrophic attacks – which, regrettably, means virtually all of them today.      Truly decentralized blockchain systems will reach critical mass not out of hope but out of necessity. Powerful actors and mainstream users will adopt blockchain as a counterbalance to digital behavior-shaping by governments and private platforms. Dramatic innovations such as decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), which manage activity automatically through smart contracts, will become significant at the end point of this process, once the foundations are in place.      Big data and artificial intelligence, pitched as freeing us from human frailties, are becoming powerful tools for social control. This is occurring along two parallel tracks: surveillance authoritarianism and surveillance capitalism. Through massive data collection and aggregation, China’s social credit system envisions an airtight regime of perfect compliance with legal and social obligations. Many other governments, including liberal democracies, are adopting similar techniques. The potential for catching terrorists, child predators and tax evaders is simply too appealing – whether it’s the real objective or a cover story.    What we need is a technology that allows for sharing without giving up control. Fortunately, it exists.    Meanwhile, private digital platforms are using troves of data to shape online experiences consistent with their business models. What you see online is, increasingly, what maximizes their profits. Companies such as Google, Amazon, Tencent and Alibaba can build the best algorithms because they have the most data. And they aren’t interested in sharing.      Regulatory interventions will fail to derail the self-reinforcing momentum for ever more centralized data repositories. They may even accelerate it by creating layers of compliance obligations that only the largest firms can meet. Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) actually increased the market share of Google and Facebook in online advertising, and so it is not surprising to see such incumbents actively welcoming the prospect of more regulation.      The only lasting solution is to change the economics of data, not to impose private property rights; that would accelerate the market forces promoting data centralization. Giving you ""ownership"" over your data means giving you legal cover to sell it, by clicking ""OK"" to a one-sided contract you’ll never read. The problem is not ownership, but control. In today’s algorithm-driven world, sharing and aggregating data increases its value, producing better models and better predictions. The trouble is that once we share, we lose control to centralized data hogs.      What we need is a technology that allows for sharing without giving up control. Fortunately, it exists. It is called blockchain. Blockchain technology is, fundamentally, a revolution in trust. In the past, trust required ceding control to counter parties, government authorities or intermediaries who occupied the essential validating roles in transaction networks. Blockchain allows participants to trust the results they see without necessarily trusting any actor to verify them. That’s why major global firms in health care, finance, transportation, international trade and other fields are actively developing cross-organizational platforms based on blockchain and related technologies. No database can provide a trusted view of information across an entire transactional network without empowering a central intermediary. Blockchain can.      Adopting any new platform at scale, along with the necessary software integration and process changes, takes time – especially when the technology is so immature. But today’s incremental deployments will serve as proofs-of-concept for the more radical innovations to come. Chinese blockchain networks are already managing tens of billions of dollars of trade finance transactions. Pharmaceutical companies are tracking drugs from manufacturing to pharmacies using the MediLedger platform. Boeing is selling a billion dollars of airline parts on Honeywell’s blockchain-based marketplace. Car insurance companies are processing accident claims in a unified environment for the first time. These and other enterprise consortia are doing the essential technical and operational groundwork to handle valuable transactions at scale.      The need for transformative approaches to data will become acute in the next five years. Every week, it seems, another outrage comes to light. For instance, users who posted photos under Creative Commons licenses or default-public settings were shocked they were sucked into databases used to train facial-recognition systems. Some were even used in China’s horrific campaign against Uighur Muslims. Clearview AI, an unknown startup, scraped three billion social media images for a face identification tool it provided, with no oversight, to law enforcement, corporations and wealthy individuals. The examples will only get worse as firms and nations learn new ways to exploit data. The core problem is there is no way to share information while retaining control over how it gets used.      See also: Jennifer Zhu Scott - You Are the Product: A Three-Step Plan to Take Back Control of Personal Data      Blockchain offers a solution. It will be widely adopted because, behind the scenes, the current data economy is reaching its breaking point. Outrage over abuses is building throughout the world. The immensely valuable online advertising economy attracts so much fraud that the accuracy of its numbers is coming into question. Communities are looking for new ways to collaborate. Governments are realizing the current system is an impediment to effective service delivery.      The technologist Bill Joy famously stated that no matter how many geniuses a company employs, most smart people work somewhere else. The same is true of data. Even giants such as Google, Facebook and Chinese government agencies need to obtain information from elsewhere in their quest for perfect real-time models of every individual. These arrangements work mostly through contracts and interfaces that ease the flow of data between organisations. As Facebook discovered when Cambridge Analytica extracted massive quantities of user data for voter targeting, these connection points are also vulnerabilities. As tighter limits are placed on data-sharing, even the big players will look for ways to rebuild trust.      The blockchain alternative will begin innocuously. Government authorities at the subnational level are deploying self-sovereign identity to pull together information securely across disparate data stores. This technology allows anyone to share private information in a fine-grained way while still retaining control. You shouldn’t have to reveal your address to confirm your age, or your full tax return to verify your stated income. The necessary cryptography doesn’t require a blockchain, but the desired trust relationships do.      Once people have identities that belong to them, not to banks or social media services, they will use them as the basis for other interactions. Imagine a world where you never need to give a third-party unnecessary data to log into a website, apply for a job, refinance a mortgage or link your bank account to a mobile payment app. Where you can keep your personal and professional profiles completely separate if you choose. Where you can be confident in the reputation of a car mechanic or an Airbnb or a product made in China without intermediaries warping ratings for their own gain. The convenience of user experiences we enjoy within the walled gardens of digital platforms will become the norm across the vastness of independent services.      We will gradually come to view access to our personal information as an episodic, focused interaction, rather than fatalistically accepting an open season based on preliminary formal consent. Major hardware companies such as Apple, which don’t depend on targeted advertising, will build decentralized identity capabilities into their devices. They will add cryptocurrency wallets linked behind the scenes to existing payment and messaging applications. Stablecoins – cryptocurrencies pegged to the dollar, pound or other assets – will help tame volatility and facilitate movement between tokens and traditional currencies. Privately created stablecoins will coexist with central bank digital currencies, which are under development in most major countries throughout the world.      Once this baseline infrastructure is widely available, the real changes will start to occur. DAOs will begin to attract assets as efficient ways for communities to achieve their goals. These entities won’t replace state-backed legal systems; they will operate within them. As numerous controversies, crashes and hacks have already demonstrated, software code is too rigid for the range of situations in the real world, absent backstops for human dispute resolution. Fortunately, there are solutions under development to connect legal and digital entities, such as OpenLaw’s Limited Liability Autonomous Organisations and Mattereum’s Asset Passports.      Today, the legal machinery of contracts strengthens the power of centralized platforms. User agreements and privacy policies enforce their control over data and limit individuals’ power to challenge it. Blockchain-based systems will flip that relationship, with the legal system deployed to protect technology-backed user empowerment. Large aggregations of information will be structured formally as ""data trusts"" that exercise independent stewardship over assets. They will operate as DAOs, with smart contracts defining the terms of data usage. Users will benefit from sharing while retaining the ability to opt out.    Data will be treated not as property but as a renewable resource, with the competition for economic value in the applications built on top of it.    Many significant applications require aggregation of data to drive algorithms, including traffic monitoring (and eventually autonomous vehicles); insurance and lending products serving previously excluded or overcharged customer groups; diagnosis and drug dosing in health care; and demand forecasting for economic modeling. Collective action problems can prevent constructive developments even when rights in data are well defined. DAOs will gradually find market opportunities, from patronage of independent artists to mortgage securitization.      The big data aggregators won’t go away. They will participate in the decentralized data economy because it provides benefits for them as well, cutting down on fraud and reinforcing user trust, which is in increasingly scarce supply. Over time, those who provide benefits of personalization and targeting will more and more be expected to pay for it. A wide range of brokering and filtering providers will offer users a choice of analytics, some embedded in applications or devices and some providing services virtually in the cloud. Governments will focus on making data available and defining policy objectives for services that take advantage of the flow of information. Data will be treated not as property but as a renewable resource, with the competition for economic value in the applications built on top of it.      The most powerful benefit of open data built on blockchain-based decentralised control is that it will allow for new applications we can’t yet envision. If startups can take advantage of the power of data aggregation that today is limited to large incumbents, they are bound to build innovations those incumbents miss.      The surveillance economy took hold because few appreciated what was happening with their data until it was too late. And the cold reality is that few will accept significantly worse functionality or user experience in return for better privacy. That is why the blockchain-powered revolution will make its way up from infrastructural foundations of digital identity and hardware, rather than down from novel user-facing applications.      This vision is far from certain to be realized. Business decisions and government policies could make blockchain-based data decentralization more or less likely. The greatest reason for optimism is that the problem blockchain addresses – gaining trust without giving up control – is becoming ever more critical. The world runs on trust.

42384684,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAl5Yj,1600256591,"All Eyes on Fed Reserve Rate Announcement, as Bitcoin Fights for $11K","While bitcoin's dips have found buyers, the cryptocurrency is struggling to clear the important psychological hurdle of $11,000 ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve's rate decision due later Wednesday.    The cryptocurrency found bids near $10,675 during the early Asian trading hours, but faced rejection near $10,940 around 08:00 UTC, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.  Bitcoin has failed twice in the past 24 hours to absorb selling pressure just below $11,000.  At press time, bitcoin is changing hands near $10,850, representing a 0.58% gain on the day.  The slight pullback this morning has weakened the case for a move above $11,000 put forward by a bull flag breakout confirmed during early European hours.  On the downside, the higher low of $10,675 created early Wednesday is the level to beat for the bears.  Price volatility may pick up following the Federal Reserve's rate decision, due at 18:00 UTC.  The Fed is expected to keep interest rates unchanged and reiterate its willingness to tolerate high inflation.  In other words, interest rates are likely to remain low for a prolonged period – a bullish development for scarce assets like bitcoin and gold.  Markets, however, have already factored in this likelihood, according to Reuters.  The focus, therefore, will be on the Fed's growth and inflation forecasts.  According to BK Asset Management's Kathy Lien, the U.S. dollar may find buyers if the Fed is more positive on economic growth. In that case, bitcoin will likely face selling pressure.  Investment banking giant Goldman Sachs has already upgraded the U.S. third quarter gross domestic product forecast to 35% from 30%.  If the Fed announces more stimulus measures, the dollar would likely drop, potentially powering stronger gains in bitcoin.  Bitcoin has become more sensitive to action in the U.S. dollar over the past 2.5 months.

The Caribbean nation of just under 400,000 people will roll-out its central bank digital currency (CBDC), dubbed the ""Sand Dollar,"" next month, Bloomberg reported Tuesday.  That will make it probably the first CBDC to launch anywhere in the world – it's been suggested China won't launch its own digital yuan initiative until the Beijing Winter Olympics in 2022.  Approximately $48,000 worth of the new CBDC will enter circulation initially and will be available via a mobile-based wallet app.  The Sand Dollar is backed 1:1 to the Bahamian dollar (BSD) which, in turn, is pegged to the U.S. dollar.  The central bank will mint more Sand Dollars as demanded, at the same time removing physical BSD out of circulation to prevent inflating the monetary supply.  Speaking to Bloomberg, Chaozhen Chen, the central bank's assistant manager of eSolutions, said the CBDC had been designed to provide people and businesses in some of the archipelago's far-flung islands with better access to financial services.  Today's news comes more than a year after the central bank first engaged local tech provider NZIA to design and implement the CBDC.  It has already been tested on the remote islands of Exuma and Abaco.

Announced Wednesday, 8i shareholders overwhelmingly approved the proposed ""business combination transaction"" with Hong Kong-based Diginex at a special meeting, with 81% in favor.  Diginex is the parent company of derivatives platform EQUOS.io, which had been hoping to become the U.S.' first publicly traded crypto exchange later this month.  It was pipped to the post, though, with Gibraltar-based INX Ltd. recently launching its SEC-registered security token IPO, aiming to raise $117 million.  Diginex's ecosystem also includes digital asset trading technology platform Diginex Access and securitization advisory firm Diginex Capital, as well as a digital asset custody provider and an investment management business.  The company received approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission for the merger with 8i back in February.  The news marks ""significant milestone"" in that process, said Diginex CEO Richard Byworth, with both parties expecting a close of the transaction later in the month.  Shareholder approval during unprecedented market conditions was a ""testament"" to the digital assets industry, Byworth noted.  Following the deal's closure, the exchange's shares are expected to be traded on the New York-based Nasdaq stock exchange under the ticker symbol ""EQOS.""

42384677,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAl5Th,1600247044,CB Insights Buys Blockdata to Build Out Blockchain Data Offering,"Netherlands-based Blockdata, which provides qualitative insights into the range of large enterprises using blockchain technology, has been acquired by data provider CB Insights.      The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. New York City’s CB Insights will be opening an office in Amsterdam, while Blockdata will remain a standalone product with its own team. Blockdata’s work will also be available to CB Insights clients, the companies said.      The acquisition demonstrates large firms are still interested in deploying distributed ledger technology (DLT) within their firewalls, and are looking for fast and thorough insights into the complex ecosystem that has grown up around enterprise blockchain.      Following the hype around DLT in 2017, the last eight months have seen large financial and enterprise clients repeatedly ask about data sources on the enterprise blockchain space, according to Anand Sanwal, CEO and co-founder of CB Insights.      “It’s become something that our clients are increasingly talking about as big and practical,” he said. “At the same time, our clients were overwhelmed with the number of companies and projects that were going on, and were struggling to identify what exactly was happening and the best use cases.”      Read more: VC Deals in Crypto Remained Steady but Amount Invested Fell in 2019: Report      As well as financial clients, Sanwal said there is interest from governments – with central banks exploring digital currencies included in that bucket – as well as hot spots like supply chain leading to interest from the likes of consumer packing firms, logistics providers and so on.      There have been various reports stating that enterprise blockchain has been languishing in Gartner’s famous “trough of disillusionment.”      “I wouldn’t say there has been a drop-off; we just see interest growing,” said Jonathan Knegtel, co-founder of Blockdata. “We started out before the crypto winter [of 2018] came along. But we’ve always said it’s about the technology, not about making money in this space. It’s about shared sources of truth and what that can do for companies.”      Knetgtel pointed out Blockdata drills into many areas of the blockchain world, not just enterprise DLT, but also custody providers, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), stablecoins, DeFi and the like.      The Amsterdam-based five-man team, which is set to grow significantly now, has previously raised a total of roughly $504,000 in angel investments.      This is CB Insights’ second acquisition following its July 2020 buy of the assets of Dow Jones’ VentureSource.      “Blockdata’s DNA is very similar to ours,” said CB Insights’ Sanwal. “We will take unstructured documents, including news and other data sources, and build technology that will classify and extract structured data from them.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/09/16/cb-insights-buys-blockdata-to-build-out-blockchain-data-offering,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/38e946e49ff971a41845f739770d687766e04619-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384676,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAl5SR,1600242650,Leaked EU Draft Proposes All-Encompassing Laws for Crypto Assets,"A leaked version of rules to be issued later this month by the European Commission proposes an all-encompassing set of regulations covering the trading or issuance of digital assets across the 27-nation bloc.      Europe’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) draft legislation provides legal certainty around crypto assets – cryptocurrencies, security tokens and stablecoins – along the same lines as Europe’s Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), a legal framework for securities markets, investment intermediaries and trading venues.      The takeaway is that Europe intends to treat crypto the same as any other regulated financial instrument, which will doubtless provide legal clarity. The unknown is whether that may stifle this nascent and fast-moving space.      The MiCA proposals begin with a broad definition of crypto assets and a base set of rules that apply to the issuers of those assets and service providers, the latter is more or less in line with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) definition of a virtual asset service provider (VASP).      There is a particular focus on stablecoins in Europe, which are defined as either asset-referenced tokens or e-money tokens.      Read more: Inside the Standards Race for Implementing FATF’s Travel Rule      To illustrate the difference, Siân Jones, senior partner at XReg Consulting, referred to the revised second version of libra’s white paper that redefined the token as being denominated in individual currencies. This would likely bring it within the MiCA regulation’s definition of e-money, said Jones.      “Those stablecoins that rely on a basket of currencies or are based by reference to other assets, whether that’s another crypto or other kinds of assets, they will be classed as asset-reference tokens,” Jones said in an interview. “Essentially, the subgroup that behaves like e-money will be sucked into the existing e-money framework, while those that are asset-referenced have a load of extra rules on top of the base rules. So clearly, this is targeting stablecoins and particularly global stablecoins.”    Stablecoin angst?    The attention to stablecoins chimes with comments made last Friday at an informal meeting of five European finance ministers in Berlin, which featured calls for clear regulatory oversight of asset-backed coins like libra.      In addition to providing legal certainty around all crypto-assets, another core tenet of the proposed regulation is apparently to support innovation.      “There will be many who will question that,” said Jones, citing the recent explosion in decentralized finance (DeFi) as an example of innovation involving the issuance of blockchain tokens that could be curtailed in Europe.      Read more: What Is Yield Farming? The Rocket Fuel of DeFi, Explained      Among the many regulatory obligations that will be imposed on crypto-asset issuers and service providers in the European Union (EU) is the need to be incorporated as a legal entity and for service providers to have their registered office in a Member State, Jones said.      “There can be little doubt MiCA will present significant challenges for those involved in DeFi projects,” said Jones.      The quid pro quo, Jones added, is the sort of regulatory clarity that will likely entice more institutional investment into the crypto space.      “By making crypto just like everything else in the traditional world, you make it easier for the traditional world to accept it,” said Jones. “I would probably say from the draft that it will favor the banks and traditional investment firms. The incumbents will have an advantage in a number of respects, which I’m sure is not the intention, but that will be the short- to medium-term impact.”      The 168-page set of draft rules, which Brussels said would come out in September, will not likely be transitioned into EU law until 2022 at the earliest. As an EU regulation, it will be directly applicable throughout the EEA without the need for national legislation.      Summing up, Jones said the new regulation will probably create something of a bifurcation of the crypto space.      “In a sense, crypto has benefited for much of the last decade from being largely in a grey area,” she said. “But now you have a very clear set of rules – and you are either in or outside it.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | REGULATION | SPONSORED | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/09/16/leaked-eu-draft-proposes-all-encompassing-laws-for-crypto-assets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/97ab9bdbe7b865a9f2351fb3d37e9c05b69a8933-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
