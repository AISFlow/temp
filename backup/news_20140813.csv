42377529,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX71nw9,1407966614,US CFPB: We Will Continue to Monitor Bitcoin,"The US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) incited a mixed response from the bitcoin community on 11th August when it issued a new warning to US consumers.  The release evoked sometimes strong language in an attempt to warn the public about the potential dangers of engaging with the bitcoin ecosystem, with CFPB Director Richard Cordray likening the ecosystem to a virtual 'Wild West'.  Following the release of the guidance, CoinDesk reached out to the CFPB for more details on how the agency has been working to educate its employees and consumers about bitcoin and digital currency, and to highlight its response to the concerns of the bitcoin ecosystem.  Though the agency stopped short of addressing industry concerns, a spokesperson for the US consumer protection group told CoinDesk that it is still actively working to understand the potential consumer protection issues by all emerging technologies, and that bitcoin is just one part of its overarching mandate.  The CFPB said:  ""We will continue to carefully monitor the development of digital currencies as they relate to the consumer financial marketplace and, if necessary, take appropriate steps.""  The CFPB declined to comment on its choice of wording in the guidance.  However, the agency suggested that its first priority is to carry out its responsibility of ensuring US consumers are protected in the financial marketplace.  Putting consumers first  The CFPB further directed CoinDesk to more general information about the agency, in which it aimed to illuminate the nature of the CFPB's most recent statements regarding bitcoin.  For example, the CFPB stressed that it was introduced specifically to address issues consumers face in the financial marketplace and to empower them to make sound financial decisions.  The agency said:  ""The CFPB was created in the wake of the financial meltdown to stand up for consumers and make sure they are treated fairly in the consumer financial marketplace. Helping consumers help themselves with tools and financial education is core to the Bureau carrying out its mission.""  It added that it currently compiles tips for consumers on a wide variety of verticals in the financial sector, including remittances, credit cards and now digital currencies.  Federal bitcoin policy evolves  The CFPB did, however, state it is working with a number of agencies to develop US federal policy on bitcoin, though it did not indicate what issues the organisations might be evaluating.  Pointing to the previously published Government Accountability Office (GAO) report, the CFPB noted it is currently working with the following groups to better understand digital currencies and their effects on a wide range of US interests:  Financial Action Task Force (FATF)  Interagency Bank Fraud Enforcement Group  International Organized Crime Intelligence and Operations Center (IOC-2)  Terrorist Finance Working Group's New Payments Systems Ad Hoc Working Group  Virtual Currency Emerging Threats Working Group.  The CFPB was first revealed to be contributing to the ongoing US policy discussion on digital currencies this June.

42377533,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX71nyf,1407959419,Circle: BitLicense Would Force Us to Block New York Customers,"Two top Circle executives have issued strong critiques of New York's proposed bitcoin regulations.  In a new blog post, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire says that the Boston-based bitcoin startup would move to block New York customers from using its service should the BitLicense proposal become law. His statement was echoed in a companion piece by company CTO Sean Neville.  Allaire is one of a growing crowd of industry leaders to weigh in on the controversial BitLicense system in recent weeks. Yet, Circle's response marks one of the first times a bitcoin company executive has declared publicly that their business would refuse to provide services to New York customers because of the proposed regulatory framework.  The Circle CEO wrote in the blog post that the regulations are “technically impossible” to comply with, creating a radically more challenging environment for digital currency companies to operate in.  He concluded:  “Without some material changes, Circle will have no choice but to block New York customers from accessing our services.”  The full post included several proposals detailing how Allaire believes the BitLicense proposal could be made more inclusive, while better positioning the bitcoin industry for growth.  Circle not alone in opposition  Calling the proposal potentially “devastating to the industry”, Allaire said that the regulations should focus more on the financial side of the bitcoin economy than the software or infrastructure aspects. This top-down approach puts developers at a significant disadvantage owing to what Allaire said were onerous and misguided rules.  Allaire’s comments were paired by an essay issued by Neville. Published on popular blog publishing platform Medium, Neville's piece asserts that Circle is not the only company looking to stay out of New York should the framework receive final approval.  Neville wrote:  “If the 'BitLicense' becomes law as drafted, this way of giving people control over their own money will be impossible and illegal in New York. At Circle, we may be forced to block all New York residents from using our services. We’re not alone.”  In his blog post, Allaire argued that it doesn’t make sense for the law to target companies that aren’t handling fiat currencies. Though, he noted his belief that this provision is a reflection of a broader misunderstanding of bitcoin and block-chain technology, commenting that misguided focus on the money aspects of bitcoin could imperil the still-nascent industry.  Leave new companies be  Allaire said that Circle would consider working with New York customers under the BitLicense system – but only if specific problems are addressed and rectified.  Beyond shifting the focus away from software developers, programmers and other businesses that aren’t acting as money transmitters, Allaire said that regulators need to be mindful of the unique challenges associated with starting a company. He advocated for a “risk-based, tiered” regulatory environment that provides a degree of support to bitcoin startups.  He wrote:  “Given the highly dynamic, technology and startup driven ecosystem that stands behind digital currency, it’s vital that whatever regulatory regime emerges provides young companies the opportunity to gain their footing before they need to take on the full burden of compliance.”  Neville echoed this sentiment, saying that these burdens will stifle any involvement that venture capital firms may have sought in New York bitcoin companies, adding:  “We need an ecosystem to develop, not a set of rules that permit only a handful of well-funded companies that are then prohibited from further growth.”  For more on how the bitcoin industry is reacting to New York's proposed regulation, read our most recent report.

42377530,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX71nxP,1407956127,Bank of Canada Research: Cryptocurrency Arbitrage Doesn't Exist,"A new working paper from Canada's central bank has found little evidence that arbitrage opportunities in cryptocurrency markets exist.  The paper, Competition in the Cryptocurrency Market, analyses 10 months of publicly available data from exchanges like BTC-e and Cryptsy, from May 2013 to February 2014.  Examining how 'network effects' (the phenomenon of new users augmenting the value of a technology) affect competition in the cryptocurrency economy, the paper looks at competition between both cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency exchanges. The authors write:  ""For exchanges, we find little if any evidence of arbitrage opportunities. With no arbitrage opportunities, it is possible for multiple exchanges to coexist in equilibrium.""  The paper was written by Hanna Halaburda, a senior analyst in the bank's currency department, and Neil Gandal, chair of the Eitan Berglas School of Economics at Tel Aviv University.  Data and methodology  For data, the authors have used 'closing rates' of bitcoin, litecoin and other digital currencies from exchanges BTC-e, Cryptsy, Bitstamp and Bitfinex for the period between 2nd May 2013 and 28th February this year.  This data was obtained from Cryptocoinscharts.info and the closing rate is the given digital currency's price at midnight GMT, according to the paper.  In analysing competition between exchanges, the authors looked at 'two-sided network effects'. This is a phenomenon that arises when buyers and sellers in a given market both compete for a larger number of counterparties: buyers of bitcoin prefer markets with more sellers, while the opposite is true of sellers.  The aggregate effect of this phenomenon is the creation of ""thicker, more liquid"" markets. A large exchange possesses more liquidity, and over time, it will dominate the exchange market. In this scenario, network effects would give rise to a convergance in digital currency trading to a single exchange over time.  But other network effects are also simultaneously at work. The 'negative same-side effect' suggests that sellers, while seeking markets with more buyers, also wish to avoid competition, or markets with large numbers of sellers. The opposite holds true for buyers.  To determine the aggregate network effects at work between exchanges, the authors looked at prices for three currency pairs, BTC/USD, LTC/USD and LTC/BTC, on three exchanges: BTC-e, Bitstamp and Bitfinex. It ran two tests, correlation and regression analysis, on the data.  Arbitrageurs dispute the findings  The paper's correlation analysis found that the BTC/USD currency pair prices were highly correlated between BTC-e and Bitstamp. It found the same for the LTC/BTC pair across BTC-e and Bitfinex.  Regression analysis yielded similar results, with the paper concluding that arbitrage opportunities were unlikely to have existed across the exchanges in trading any of the currency pairs.  However, two traders who were alerted to the paper dispute its conclusions and methodology. Arthur Hayes is a former equity derivatives trader at Citi and the chief executive of BitMEX, a bitcoin derivatives exchange. He makes money as an arbitrageur, trading between various exchanges. He observed:  ""I make a significant portion of my income from conducting arbitrage between different bitcoin exchanges. The [second half of 2013] was a very profitable time for arbitrage strategies.""  In other words, Hayes is an arbitrageur who profits from a market phenomenon that the Bank of Canada’s working paper says does not exist.  Hayes even offered a historic example of a profitable arbitrage strategy:  ""For almost a week, there was 20-40% arbitrage [opportunity] between European and Chinese exchanges trading at considerable premiums. The reverse, where China traded cheaper than Europe, was also witnessed [this spring] when [China's central bank] made announcements relating to banks dealing with bitcoin exchanges.""  Proposed improvements  In Hayes' view, the authors couldn't pick up on arbitrage opportunities for two reasons: comparing prices between too few exchanges and using regression analysis instead of a simple time series of price data.  Hayes pointed out that paper only compared prices between European exchanges. For a better insight the authors should have compared prices across continents, he added.  ""The issue is that these guys looked at European exchanges versus each other and Chinese exchanges versus each other. They didn't compare all exchanges versus each other.""  Another trader, Joseph Lee, created arbitrage bots that managed his trading for a year, netting him hundreds of thousands of dollars. He has since retired the bots to focus on derivatives exchange BTC.sx. Lee also disagrees with the conclusions of Halaburda and Gandal's working paper.  ""Without a doubt, arbitrage opportunities have existed in [the period of study] and will always exist in the market. They even exist in the current financial market which has trillions of dollars of liquidity,"" he said.  Lee points out a flaw in the paper's methodology: the authors relied on 'closing rates' for price data, which Lee says would never show an opening for arbitrage.  Closing rates are a snapshot of prices at a given time (in this case midnight GMT) and they are used to represent the currency's price for a 24-hour period. However, because arbitrage opportunities are fleeting – they disappear in seconds as arbitrageurs see them and pile in – closing rates aren't sensitive enough to reveal these moments.  Lee added:  ""The study has to be done on actual traded prices if it's looking historically. Arbitrage opportunities don't last 24-hour periods. In bitcoin they last minutes, if not seconds.""  Other findings and caveats  The paper briefly acknowledges that its use of daily price data may have problems. It notes that arbitrage opportunities may be found if price differences between exchanges are compared at different times during a day.  ""We leave this more detailed analysis to further research,"" the authors noted towards the end of their paper.  Halaburda and Gandal also came to a number of other conclusions about network effects and cryptocurrencies. The pair found that bitcoin enjoyed positive network effects, but that other currencies, like litecoin, were gaining ground. Bitcoin may not be able to maintain its dominant position in the long run, it concluded.  The Bank of Canada's working papers are intended for publication in peer-reviewed academic journals, but are works in progress. They are published with the intention of soliciting feedback from a technical audience. In the case of Halaburda and Gandal's paper, bitcoin's arbitrageurs have made their opinions known.

Three versions of its wallet are available in the App Store. The functionality of each is tailored to different levels of users' exposure to and knowledge of bitcoin.  Bitcoin Wallet Plus: Coinplug's basic mobile app aimed at iPhone users who want to own, buy, sell and trade bitcoins at market price and limit price;  Bitcoin Wallet: the basic, 'lite' version for users who only want to send, receive and hold bitcoins; and  Bitcoin Balance Checker: for users who don't want to hold bitcoins, but still need to monitor addresses. This app can still scan any QR code to check a wallet's balance.  Bitcoin adoption in South Korea  Coinplug  's Richard Yun said the Korean media has been trying to educate people about bitcoin, especially Maeil, the country's daily business newspaper.  Yun added that Maeil holds Asia's largest annual business forum that usually hosts some of the world's top business speakers.  After suggesting a bitcoin-focused event, local bitcoiners convinced Maeil to add a digital currency sub-section to this year's conference, which will include Roger Ver, Jinyoung Lee of the Bitcoin Foundation and Korea University professor Peter Ho In.  Coinplug's progress  Since November 2013, Coinplug has raised $800,000 in VC funding, partly from Tim Draper's personal investment firm DFJ. It also assisted in developing South Korea's first and native bitcoin ATM, and launched three mobile apps for the Android platform in February.  Coinplug announced in July it would process payments for Galaxia Communications, which handles online payments as well as gift certificates and voucher sales.

42425960,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhRJh,1407943274,Shift Developing Hybrid Fiat and Bitcoin Debit Card,"A debit card that combines cryptocurrency, loyalty points and fiat money could soon be a reality thanks to Californian startup Shift Payments.  Shift's card, currently only compatible with bitcoin and ripple, is in the process of being tested by 100 participants in San Francisco Bay and beyond, according to TechCrunch.  Shift’s hybrid debit card  The Y Combinator startup began working on a prototype debit card last year. By November 2013 the team had produced a card that could let users spend funds from their Ripple accounts. Since then Shift has also added bitcoin integration via Coinbase.  Following its current cryptocurrency pilot, Shift hopes to add support for loyalty schemes and regular bank accounts. The card will still use the Ripple protocol for settlement and will be supported by a mobile app.  Shift says the finished debit cards will be supported by a major international card network and an undisclosed payment processor. However, despite this success co-founder Meg Nakamura revealed that the startup, like many cryptocurrency companies, has struggled to get US banks on board.  She told TechCrunch:  “We learned very quickly that no bank here in the US is willing to take that leap and actually support something like this. They were just too nervous and no one was willing to take that reputational risk.”  Nakamura added that it will take time for US banks to fully embrace digital currency businesses. While banks are excited about the technology and its potential, they are still tracking developments on the regulatory front before making a move, she added.  Debit card issuers are not the only bitcoin businesses experiencing similar problems. At a Chicago conference in May, representatives from several bitcoin operators detailed how bank-related setbacks had affected their businesses.  Startup with big plans  Shift's founders – Greg Kidd, Meg Nakamura and Eugene Otto – have a background in payments, telecommunications and regulation. Kidd was previously an analyst at the Federal Reserve and both Kidd and Nakamura have consulted a number of San Francisco companies, including Square and Twitter.  Having worked on data aggregation and messaging projects, the team noted that the mobile messaging market was over-saturated and decided to pursue digital payments instead.  A number of bitcoin debit cards have been announced in recent months, from companies including Xapo, CoinJelly, Diamond Circle and ANX.

42425975,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhRfh,1407934444,"8,000 Convenience Stores in Argentina Now Sell Bitcoin","BitPagos has launched Ripio, a new bitcoin brokerage service that allows consumers in Argentina to buy small amounts of bitcoin at more than 8,000 convenience stores.  To achieve this goal, Ripio will integrate with TeleRecargas, a popular mobile phone service that allows consumers to prepay for cell phone plans at a network of partner convenience stores across Argentina.  Argentina and Palo Alto-based bitcoin merchant processor BitPagos raised $600,000 from prominent bitcoin angel investors earlier this year. The company's CEO Sebastian Serrano told CoinDesk that Ripio aims to target underbanked consumers as well as existing bitcoin users who want an easy way to buy bitcoins at a physical location.  He explained:  ""You can go to any location, give them your account in Ripio and the amount of pesos you want to get in bitcoins. Boom: you have some bitcoins. It's going be extremely easy to use and to buy bitcoins easily, securely and near you, even if you don't have a bank account. We think that this is going to push adoption.""  For now, the service will only be available in Argentina, though Serrano sees the service as broadly appealing to consumers in other Latin American markets that could benefit from an easy bitcoin-buying solution.  In particular, Serrano said BitPagos is looking to expand Ripio to Venezuela, but that this program expansion will take time to achieve.  How Ripio works  While Ripio works primarily at physical locations, Serrano indicated that users must first complete an initial registration on the platform's website.  Users next print their Ripio ID and search the service's map for available stores. Still, Serrano is confident that these elements of the service will be convenient for on-the-go users or those still learning the basics of bitcoin management.  Serrano explained:  ""You can do the registration on your cell phone, you get your account number, you look at the map with places near you, you walk in and say you want to buy some bitcoins with Ripio and you say the amount in pesos you want to buy, that's it.""  A new consumer offering  In the interview, Serrano sought to frame Ripio as a novel service that was different from the other offerings currently available in what has increasingly become a fertile area for bitcoin adoption due to lingering economic uncertainty.  Serrano suggested that because of Argentina's unique needs, his competitors in the ecosystem may face challenges modeling their services after existing platforms available internationally.  ""So far, most of the bitcoin services in Argentina have been trying to replicate models that work in other countries,"" Serrano said. ""Trying to build exchanges or do an exchange where you deposit bitcoins for doing trading. We think there is a need for this to expand the market.""  Notably, Ripio will use Brazil-based bitcoin exchange Mercado Bitcoin to determine the price at which it sells bitcoin to consumers.  Spreading awareness  Of course, Serrano is also conscious of the fact that Ripio will need promotion in order to resonate with one of its key demographics: underbanked consumers.  However, he suggested that Ripio's launch will also coincide with the release of marketing materials that will increase general awareness of bitcoin.  He noted that Ripio will send out marketing materials to TeleRecargas' partner stores in conjunction with the launch, but that the service is also seeking to leverage Argentina's passionate bitcoin user base.  Serrano concluded:  ""We're also going to focus on the bitcoin community to deliver us the existing bitcoin users. But, I think this is also going to get more awareness just by being in high traffic locations.""  Ricardo Minicucci, president for TeleRecargas, echoed this sentiment in a statement, saying:  ""For us this represents the possibility of providing a link between the offline and online world efficiently, plus the customer intimacy that characterizes Telerecargas will enable a natural adoption to the bitcoin system""  Image credit:jongjet303 / Shutterstock.com",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/08/13/8000-convenience-stores-in-argentina-now-sell-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/db49426f8b20be956c5c151a2cf35a66eacc49a3-1263x550.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425977,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhRlh,1407924408,CAVIRTEX Brings Bitcoin ATMs to Canada's Malls and Tourist Spots,"CAVIRTEX has launched its first six bitcoin-branded ATMs in the greater Toronto area.  The machines mark the first phase of the exchange's larger plan to bring 10 bitcoin ATMs to Canada through a partnership with Gateway Newstands, a retail chain with 500 locations in North America.  Speaking to CoinDesk, CAVIRTEX's marketing and business development director Kyle Kemper said the launch was a major milestone for the Calgary-based company and bitcoin itself.  Although details about the ATMs were first revealed back in May, Kemper said that the company has taken time to execute its vision and maximise the impact of the launch.  Kemper told CoinDesk:  ""We were looking for really high-traffic locations, because we want to bring CAVIRTEX and bitcoin to the general Canadian [...] public.""  Pictures of the vibrant units first surfaced online earlier this month, with many Reddit users lauding the company's novel design and expressing excitement for the formal launch.  Notably, the bitcoin ATMs were provided to CAVIRTEX by BitAccess, the bitcoin ATM manufacturer that was recently accepted into Californian accelerator Y Combinator.  High-traffic locations  Kemper indicated that its decision to partner with Gateway lead the company to secure a number of high-value locations. Perhaps the most notable new entry to CAVIRTEX's network lies at the famed tourist destination Niagara Falls.  Kemper indicated that CAVIRTEX has installed an bitcoin ATM at the Casino Niagara, the first casino built in Niagara in 1996. One of a number of regional attractions near the natural wonder, the destination features 10,000 square meters of gambling space, on-site dining and free live music.  Additional noteworthy locations for the ATMs include the Bayshore Mall in Ottawa, Scarborough Town Center in Toronto and the Yorkdale Shopping Centre in Toronto, among others.  CAVIRTEX will connect its two-way bitcoin ATMs directly to its online exchange, and customers can elect to send bitcoin to a paper or digital wallet.  Gateway seeks innovation  Initially, suitable high-traffic locations for CAVIRTEX's bitcoin ATMs had proved difficult to find. However, this all changed following the company's partnership with Gateway Newsstands.  Kemper explained:  ""Gateway Newstands has 500 locations across Canada and the US, in very high-traffic locations, but they're in the news and lottery business. Physical businesses have been taking hits the last few years, so they were looking to innovate and bitcoin presented that opportunity.""  Terry Samuels, vice president of Gateway Newstands, confirmed that his company will seek to leverage the bitcoin ATMs to attract new customers, saying:  ""Our high-traffic Gateway Newstands locations provide us the opportunity to innovatively step up to the plate.”  Kemper added that CAVIRTEX currently has a deal with Gateway to install 10 bitcoin ATMs at Gateway locations.  BitAccess shifts to enterprise  Speaking to CoinDesk, BitAccess co-founder Haseeb Awan said that the CAVIRTEX launch also represents a significant milestone for his company, which is turning its focus to fulfilling large-scale orders with its white-label ATM offering.  ""With this launch, we'll have 27 machines in Canada alone, which means that we will be covering a majority of the market share in Canada,"" Awan said.  He added that bitcoin consumers can expect more big announcements from BitAccess in the coming weeks and months. In particular, rollouts in the US and European markets.  Awan also pointed to the unique exterior design of the CAVIRTEX machines as evidence of his team's abilities. BitAccess bills itself as the only bitcoin ATM provider that builds its units from scratch, using proprietary technology.  Awan said:  ""We have a design team that modifies the ATM according to customer requirements, and that's a huge plus as opposed to anyone else in the market. Basically, the customer orders and we craft it for them.""  For more details on where you can find a BitAccess ATM or any other bitcoin ATM in your area, visit the CoinDesk Bitcoin ATM Map.

42425966,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhRTh,1407920192,"P2P Bitcoin Lending Platform Bitbond Receives €200,000 Seed Funding","Peer-to-peer bitcoin lending company Bitbond has secured €200,000 in seed funding during a round led by early-stage investment firm Point Nine Capital.  The funding will help Bitbond broaden its user base and accelerate loan origination. The company will also grow its programming team to improve the platform’s user experience.  Bitbond is also planning new features including exchange rate linked loans, user communication tools and analytics resources for lenders, as well as an improved mobile platform.  In its pursuit to make investment and finance businesses accessible worldwide, the Berlin-based firm aims to become another essential building block in the bitcoin ecosystem. “Wallets, payment providers, brokers and exchanges are already on a fairly well-developed level,” said founder Radoslav Albrecht.  “Financial services are just at the beginning and Bitbond wants to contribute to a bitcoin ecosystem where financial inclusion isn't just limited to cashless, instant worldwide payments.”  Citing the warming attitudes of British regulators toward bitcoin and mobile technology, Point Nine Capital co-founder and managing partner Pawel Chudzinski said that cross-border trade and services activity in the EU is expanding steadily. As a result, he added, there are more international payments transpiring – however:  “International payments are still very expensive if you're using traditional banking services, especially when the transactions are small. To focus on Bitbond, I think lending smaller amounts of money internationally to private customers and small businesses is still rather unheard of.”  A marketplace, not a bank  Bitbond launched in July 2013. It has since funded more than 180 loans worth over €36,000 ($48,000) to date, and has a user base of approximately 4,100 people from over 100 countries.  Users wanting to take out a loan or invest their savings can tap a global market to do so independently of family, friends or banking institutions – they only need a smartphone or computer with access to the Internet.  Because of the platform’s peer-to-peer system, borrowers receive loans at affordable interest rates, and lenders gain higher interest rates compared to other fixed income asset classes.  Albrecht emphasized that although the company might function as a bank, it doesn’t operate as one. Bitbond, he said, is a marketplace that connects borrowers and lenders on a global scale.  He told CoinDesk:  “We basically fulfil functions that the bank typically does. We provide credit and we provide investment opportunities, but there is one crucial difference: we don’t have the balance sheet. We only connect borrowing and lending […] A bank stands more in between the two, while we just connect them.”  Describing user activity, he said that borrowers disclose personal and financial information during sign-up and are verified once they have been deemed creditworthy. If they’re denied, they can publish loan requests detailing how much bitcoin they need and why.  The lenders that sign up, he continued, want to support bitcoin projects or come to the platform to earn interest on their bitcoin savings. They decide independently which projects they find interesting.  International influence  Albrecht pointed to globalization, the recent credit crunch and the European regulatory environment as influential developments that guided his attention on the bitcoin economy for the business he would eventually build.  He explained:  “In many of these economies (eg Spain, Italy, Portugal) small businesses contribute a significant portion to the country's GDP and employ the majority of the workforce. Bitbond does not only focus on emerging markets but also on European economies where banks don't live up to their expectations to provide credit to the real economy.”  Chudzinski said that the Bitbond team’s strong expertise in bitcoin, technology and finance played a crucial role in its investment decision. As well, their backgrounds in economics, financial services and banking perhaps further validate their leadership in international bitcoin lending.  A former Deutsche Bank trader who became an industry consultant some time after leaving the German banking giant, Albrecht spent roughly six months in Sub-Saharan Africa working on a post-merger integration of two Nigerian banks.  There, he said, he was exposed to an economy where few people have bank accounts, but in which access to mobile payments are “already quite the norm”. He called the experience a “crucial” part of the beginnings of Bitbond, concluding:  “I believe that had I not had that experience, had I not seen it over a longer time period … I’m not sure I would have believed in the potential that bitcoin has without those experiences.”  Lending image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Tanaya Macheel,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/08/13/p2p-bitcoin-lending-platform-bitbond-receives-200000-seed-funding,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ca260d7bac8fc14b92528066e4736001bcec8827-1271x1024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
