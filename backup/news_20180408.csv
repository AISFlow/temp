42380518,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8gGGn,1523224898,Bitcoin Forks and Livestock Law? Tax Day 2018 Is a Different Animal,"Stevie D. Conlon is a vice president and tax and regulatory counsel; Anna Vayser is a product manager and Robert Schwaba is a senior tax and regulatory specialist with Wolters Kluwer. They acknowledge the contributions of colleagues John Kareken and Cynthia Lapins.  The following article, an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's Crypto and Taxes 2018 series, is adapted from “Taxation of Bitcoin, Its Progeny, and Related Derivatives: Ex Coin Machina,” published in Tax Notes, February 19, 2018.      If the great bitcoin forks of 2017 entitled existing bitcoin holders to “free money,” as was often said, do Americans have to pay tax on that windfall, and how much?  This is a particularly timely question due to recent volatility in cryptocurrency values and the approaching April 17 U.S. deadline to file tax returns. Unfortunately, there is no guidance from the IRS or existing law specifically addressing the matter.  However, current tax law should be considered. On a fork, the new cryptocurrency received (such as bitcoin cash, which split off from the main bitcoin network in August, or bitcoin gold, created in November) is not identical to the cryptocurrency already held.  Generally, the definition of taxable income under U.S. tax law is broad and exceptions are few. For example, found property is generally taxable to the finder per IRS regulations, rulings and court cases.  Although tax law excludes gifts from the recipient’s income, it can be difficult to prove that a transfer is a gift and the exclusion is narrow. Similarly, prizes and awards are taxable income.  And tax law providing tax-free treatment for stock splits and other corporate reorganizations is either generally limited to receipt of the same (not similar) stock or has other requirements that narrow eligibility.  As a result, one might conclude that a fork causing the receipt of a new cryptocurrency of determinable value could trigger taxable income.  A different animal  Although new cryptocurrency received in a fork differs from that already held, could it be analogous to the taxation of pregnant livestock?  In a 1986 revenue ruling and a 1977 Tax Court case the IRS addressed the tax consequences of the birth of a calf and a foal, respectively. In each case, the purchaser acquired the pregnant cow or mare knowing it was pregnant. The value of the unborn calf or foal was determinable at the time of acquisition (not at birth) and was used to allocate a portion of the purchase price upon birth of the offspring (with no tax being paid at that time).  Could these authorities support similarly treating the receipt of cryptocurrency in a fork as nontaxable?  If this approach were applied to new cryptocurrency acquired in a fork, would it only apply to holders who had knowledge of the pending “birth” of the new cryptocurrency at time of acquisition (as was the case in the ruling and court case discussed above)?  And would basis allocations be made by reference to valuations at time of acquisition (rather than at time of the fork)?  In absence of clear guidance, treating the receipt as taxable would seem to be the conservative approach, while treating it as tax-free could be risky, with potential tax, interest and penalty consequences.  Timing of income  Even if the gain is taxable, timing presents a related question.  There has been and could be delayed access to the new cryptocurrency depending on the exchange or other manner by which a specific holder owns her cryptocurrency. Values differ from day to day. Which value should be used for determining the amount of taxable income?  Under tax rules treating found property as income, the timing of income depends on when the finder has dominion and control. Applying this rule to forks, some holders might be entitled to access (and considered as having dominion and control of) the new cryptocurrency received earlier than other holders.  Does timing of income recognition (if taxable) differ? Does timing of income require taking control, such as transferring or selling the new cryptocurrency? Or does it occur earlier, such as when the holder has the right to do so, or has awareness of control—such as upon reviewing an account statement?  The taxable amount  If timing of income recognition differs from holder to holder, does the amount of taxable income differ based on the date when income is recognized?  Market values of either the existing or newly received cryptocurrency typically change after the date of a fork. If the new cryptocurrency received is taxable, it logically follows that the recipient’s tax cost basis should equal the amount of income or gain recognized, and the holding period should start the next day. The basis in the existing cryptocurrency should be unaffected.  Another consideration if a fork results in taxable income is the income’s character as ordinary income or capital gain. Different tax character results in different tax rates, rules and permitted items that can offset such income or capital gains. Capital gains and losses require a sale or exchange seemingly absent in the context of a fork, so presumably any income recognized would be ordinary income.  Even if receipt of new cryptocurrency is nontaxable, the recipient’s tax basis in the new cryptocurrency must be determined. The new basis could be zero, in which case any subsequent gain would be taxable.  Otherwise, the basis would need to be allocated between the cryptocurrency held before and after the fork, leading to questions of how to determine basis allocation and the tax law justification.  American Bar and IRS  The American Bar Association's Tax Section submitted a report to the IRS dated March 19 that discusses these issues. The ABA report recommended a temporary solution in part treating the 2017 forks as taxable events but with a deemed value of zero. This proposal may not fly given the reported values of the new coins at the time of the forks.  And on March 23, the IRS reminded taxpayers to report virtual currency transactions on their tax returns and warned of the tax liability, interest and penalty costs of failing to do so.  Conclusion  The U.S. income tax treatment of forks is unclear. However, there is a risk that the receipt of the new cryptocurrency could be taxable as ordinary income to the recipient, and it seems that a conservative approach would be to treat it this way.  There are also concerns regarding the timing and amount of income. Holders of cryptocurrency should consider these issues and discuss them with their tax advisors due to tax liability, interest and penalty risks.

42380503,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8gG0R,1523187045,Is XRP a Security? Major Ripple Debates Explained,"What is a ""cryptocurrency?""  Try as Webster's dictionary may, a formal definition remains hard to pin down. While it's unclear exactly when the word itself was coined, bitcoin, the world's very first such cryptographically backed asset, is probably the answer that most often springs to mind.  Still, a vast array of very different technologies now carry and use the moniker, and companies, opportunists and investors all seem to have their own version of the word and its meaning.  Naturally, some crypto assets have also run afoul of this ever-changing status quo.  Perhaps the largest yet to draw this complaint is XRP, the third-largest cryptocurrency by value and the technology that powers just one of several enterprise banking products offered by San Francisco startup Ripple.  Earlier this year, XRP broke out of its sideways trading, moving from around $0.30 to nearly $4. While the price soon after receded, interest in Ripple is larger than ever, with a whole new captured audience cheering on its announcements and partnerships.  But as many others are keen to point out, bitcoin and XRP aren't exactly the same. In fact, calling both ""cryptocurrencies,"" to some, would be like calling fruits vegetables.  “Just a friendly reminder. Ripple is not a cryptocurrency,” BitcoinTalk user ""leopard2"" wrote recently.  It’s a statement echoed by many others throughout the industry.  ""I don’t call this cryptocurrency. It’s not currency,” Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said at a Yahoo Finance conference in February.  Instead, the company seems to prefer the term ""digital asset."" And that isn't necessarily just smoke and mirrors. Indeed, terms such as token, asset, unit and currency are used indiscriminately throughout the industry.  So, while XRP may not fit the definition of cryptocurrency, examining the technology from the lens of this nomenclature and its debates can be helpful in understanding its key features.  XRP is centralized  One of the main criticisms of XRP is that it's not truly ""decentralized.""  If you're new to the space, that might not mean much. But decentralization is a big deal to crypto enthusiasts. In many ways, it's an attribute that separates cryptocurrencies from older online money systems, where a central authority could block or have control over transactions.  Supporters of ""decentralized cryptocurrencies"" tout the internet as an example of a decentralized system in that information moves freely and openly (with some restrictions) and without any central party in the middle operating it.  Others see centralization as a trade-off, arguing it's often too inefficient. Ripple developers readily admit XRP does things differently and isn't as decentralized as they would like it to be.  The debate, then, is not over how centralized Ripple is but whether it produces a better online money without the same full decentralization of bitcoin.  The argument against XRP: Some argue XRP doesn't add anything new in the way of innovations in crypto-economics, another buzzword in the nascent field.  One often touted sticking point is Ripple the company selects which nodes validate transactions, compiling what's known as the Unique Node List (UNL). In bitcoin, ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, anyone running the software can perform this action.  Indeed, a major cryptocurrency exchange went so far as to call out this point in a research report on Ripple released last month, which argues XRP ""does not serve a clear purpose.""  Although Ripple has brought on a range of entities to validate transactions on the network, including the likes of Microsoft and MIT that are now running XRP nodes, critics argue the way the algorithm is set up, other nodes veer toward trusting Ripple's node and, therefore, the company itself.  The argument for Ripple: Ripple developers argue the opposite, that XRP is better than more traditional cryptocurrencies for several reasons: It's faster and more scalable. Plus, it's less expensive to secure than bitcoin's energy-hungry proof-of-work.  Cory Johnson, Ripple chief market executive, went as far as to argue XRP ""demonstrates an intrinsic value"" that stands out among ""sillier"" coins and assets.  Not to mention that time and time again, Ripple developers have argued they plan to decentralize XRP over time, a goal they've chronicled in their company blog. And there's merit to suggest it is. Already, startups are looking to do things with XRP, such as launch initial coin offerings (ICO), that the company doesn't quite condone.  In an earlier interview with CoinDesk, Ripple CTO Stefan Thomas went as far as to contend XRP will be ""more decentralized"" than bitcoin in the future as it adds more validators and flesh out the technology. He and other Ripple developers further argue they've delivered on their past promises.  Back when XRP wasn't open source, critics argued it would never be. But Ripple open sourced the code for its XRP ""full node,"" meaning it could get more scrutiny from outside developers and users could for the first time use to operate to join the network in 2013, seen as at the time as a step away from sole control of the online token from Ripple the company.  Because of its track record of delivering on its goal of decentralizing XRP, including adding 55 more validators to the network last year, Ripple developers believe there's at least some reason to believe it will fulfill its vision, however ambitious.  Ripple and XRP's relationship is problematicly vague  Nomenclature aside, there's still Ripple's relationship to the XRP Ledger to parse.  Indeed, a recent Bloomberg report noted that because XRP isn't clearly defined, it could end up being considered a security by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The assertion seems to stem from attempts by Ripple to have XRP listed on major exchanges, attempts the news source alleges may have failed over this concern.  ""While the coin doesn’t represent an ownership stake in Ripple, the concern is the close relationship might still lead regulators to deem XRP a security,"" the report reads.  In response, the issue has seen no shortage of airtime on social media.  The argument against Ripple: Critics here argue there's a case that XRP could be considered a security because of the way that it was released in many ways a variation on the ICO model.  Indeed, after XRP Ledger (then called the Ripple Consensus Ledger) was created, XRP tokens were distributed to users of popular bitcoin forums in what isn't all that different from what's today called an ""airdrop.""  But while speculative, the comments hint at another issue, the seeming preference among Ripple executives for talking up XRP when the price is going up.  Critics argue that when the token sees boosted attention, such as it has over the last several months, Ripple's leaders parade it around. In a recent Fox News interview, for example, CEO Garlinghouse trumpeted XRP specifically as the beginning of a ""new asset class"" solving a ""global payments problem.""  Meanwhile, when it's trading sideways, the public-facing company doesn't pay it much attention, critics argue, adding that if Ripple really believes XRP is a crucial piece of its product, the startup should herald it consistently (and within the boundaries of securities laws).  The argument for Ripple: Still, others see the security question as moot.  For one, Ripple's business doesn't directly influence the value of its cryptocurrency, though it would doubtless benefit from the kind of demand generated by large banking institutions using it to move transactions.  In this way, supporters argue there has always been a clear purpose for XRP: It makes any financial products built on the platform even faster and cheaper.  Plus, it's not exactly fair to say the entire company has flip-flopped on its view of XRP.  Many of Ripple's chief developers and researchers have held strong to the idea of XRP as a token, even if the public-facing company appears less steadfast.  Banks don't have a reason to use XRP  Ripple has always touted itself as a partner for banks and other large financial services providers, but many critics think the company doesn't give those providers any real compelling reason to use XRP.  That said, a spate of companies have begun using all three of Ripple's products – xCurrent, xRapid and xVia – this year. Even a number of financial institutions and payments providers have started piloting the use of xRapid, Ripple's only product that hinges on XRP use.  The argument against Ripple: Critics argue XRP will never get much adoption from big entities. (Even some Ripple clients have said they think XRP is too volatile and risky a currency to adopt right now.)  Pseudonymous cryptocurrency investor and essayist P4man argues the two ideas Ripple tries to mix only make sense independently. RipplePay, an idea predating cryptocurrency that allows local communities to have more control over their currencies, makes sense as an innovative way to send money through a network of people that users trust. And bitcoin makes sense as a new type of digital currency without control.  But mashing them together, as Ripple does, just doesn't work, he contends. Rather it results in an overcomplex system that doesn’t result in what it’s supposed to: cheaper, faster payments.  And P4man goes on to make an even bolder claim: The only ""rational reason"" for XRP to exist is for Ripple to make money off it amid the cryptocurrency craze, a claim he and other critics believe is backed up by the fact the company and associated foundations own at least 60 billion of the 100 billion total XRP coins.  The argument for Ripple: Ripple and its supporters, though, do think there's a reason – they often describe Ripple's ledger products as a Trojan horse. Once they successfully carry the Ripple horse to enough banks around the world, they will unleash XRP on the unsuspecting financial system.  This is already happening as Ripple begins to encourage companies using xCurrent to move to xRapid for added liquidity.  Ripple Chief Cryptographer David Schwartz expanded on this view in an XRP chat post, arguing that as the startup expands the number of ""corridors"" in which it operates, XRP's usefulness increases.  ""Now, say you’re a company like Seagate that pays out money all over the globe. If you have to make payments to five countries in our corridors, you’d rather hold one pile of XRP than five piles of different currencies,"" he said in a post on the forum, XRP chat.  While admitting it's ""a pretty crazy thing"" Ripple is trying to do, Schwartz continued:  ""If that succeeds, it should massively increase the price of XRP.""

42380517,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8gGFX,1523182513,5 Steps to Stress-Free Crypto Tax Accounting,"Sonya Baumstein is a crypto-accounting veteran at New Alchemy, a strategy and technology group focused on blockchain innovation and tokenization.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's Crypto and Taxes 2018 series.      With tax season upon us, the meteoric rise of cryptocurrencies may become a double-edged sword for participants in the United States.  As crypto gained thousands of enthusiasts in 2017 and grew to a $400 billion industry, it also drew the eye of federal regulators.  Changes in our tax laws have already occurred. Effective this year, Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 excludes crypto-to-crypto trades from being treated as 1031 like-kind exchanges – a safe harbor long used by traders to defer taxable gains.  The prudent crypto individual or business must keep up with regulation and develop a process to organize information relating to buying and selling of digital currencies. Due diligence and documentation with accounting can act as a safeguard to show that your logic was in line with the most up-to-date compliance at the time of reporting.  Obviously adjustments will need to be made as regulations evolve, but proper preparation can go a long way.  Here are five steps to successfully include crypto in a bookkeeping system:  Don’t mix addresses  The reality of crypto is that you can receive and send payments from any multitude of addresses you create at will. Unless you are tracking each and every one of these addresses meticulously, this creates a pretty difficult job for your accountant, especially if you may also function as a business.  Do yourself and your finance team a favor: only transact for your business from addresses you deem to be “business-related.” Keep your personal expenses separate.  Of course, no one wants their complete records (whether business or personal) to be available in one neat (and public) address, but you can limit the time and effort spent accounting for your addresses by phasing in new ones on a pre-set schedule. Engage your finance team early; they are your best advocates.  Keep a running ledger of income/expense  Reported fiat values in the transaction history for tokens sent almost never line up one-to-one with agreed upon fiat values. Knowing this is the reality of blockchain transactions is important, but doesn’t negate the significance of tracking.  Record your transactions on your regular books as clearly as possible and keep an addendum ledger that specifically tracks your cryptocurrencies.  Each ledger for each currency should include information such as date; recipient or sender name; total amount of coin treated as income, expense or trade; the value at the time of the transaction; the transaction hash; a memo that states the kind of income, expense or trade that occurred (i.e. service income, perhaps a project name, etc.)  If you want to go the extra mile, you could have a register like this for each of your addresses.  Decide: FIFO or LIFO?  If you’re following the tip above and keeping a clear ledger of your assets, you should be able to easily track any gains or losses associated with paying your expenses using crypto or with trading one coin for another.  As part of this, work closely with your accountant to choose your accounting inventory theory — first in, first out (FIFO) or last in, first out (LIFO) —and stick to it for all of your transactions.  If you are outside of the U.S., however, the best rule of thumb is probably to stick with FIFO. Consistency and continuity from year to year is key, so don’t take this decision lightly and as always, consult with your advisors to find the most appropriate solution for your particular circumstances.  Take screenshots of transactions  You have to be able to provide supplemental evidence of transactions in receipt form, exactly like credit cards or bank statements.  The best way to do this, especially for large transactions, is to screenshot the transaction in addition to recording the transaction hash in your ledger.  Also include any additional invoices from vendors, customer contracts and/or supporting emails. This is important for accounting continuity if you have any personnel changes or any outside party needs access to the records.  Know where the money comes from  Transact in good faith with other, verifiable parties. Use common sense and don’t deal with organizations or individuals who don’t measure up to scrutiny, whether in fiat or crypto.  Most importantly, realize the public ledger is not enough. No one, least of all your accountant, wants to scramble to reinvent your financial wheel.  Be proactive in your crypto financial controls and recordkeeping. It’s the best way to play by the rules – even if all the rules don’t yet exist.
