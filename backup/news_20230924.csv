Against that backdrop, certain non-fungible tokens (NFTs) mopped up millions of dollars from buyers. But, after a painful market downturn, the vast majority of those digital collectibles can't even fetch a penny. Indeed, a recent study from dappGambl, a community of cryptocurrency researchers, found that 69,795, or 95%, of the 73,257 NFT collections it analyzed have a market cap of zero ethereum ( ETH-USD ), the world's most popular altcoin. By its estimates, about 23M investors own these worthless tokens. To be clear, NFTs are digital assets , such as artwork, GIFs, and music, that are stored on the blockchain and cannot be replicated. The tokens are transferred from one owner to another using blockchain technology, which creates a digital trail from seller to buyer that verifies the transaction. Like other speculative assets, investors buy NFTs in hopes that their values rise, allowing them to be sold at a profit. “This daunting reality should serve as a sobering check on the euphoria that has often surrounded the NFT space,” the report said. “Amid stories of digital art pieces selling for millions and overnight success stories, it is easy to overlook the fact that the market is fraught with pitfalls and potential losses.” Lack of demand dappGambl, using data provided by NFT Scan, also found that there isn’t enough NFT demand to absorb supply, with 29% of collections included in the study remaining unsold. “As a result, projects that lack clear use cases, compelling narratives, or genuine artistic value are finding it increasingly difficult to attract attention and sales.” At the height of the NFT craze, it was common to see headlines focusing on tokens that sold for millions of dollars. In March 2021, for example, a Beeple artwork NFT sold for $69.3M and former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey sold his first tweet for over $2.9M. Now, after filtering out the less significant collections in the study, less than 1% of NFTs have a price tag exceeding $6K, and the majority of the most expensive projects are priced between $5 and $100. What does the future hold for NFTs? While many suggest NFTs are in fact dead after the 2021-2022 frenzied bull market, dappGambl believes there’s still a place for them, maintaining its view that “once the dust has settled, we will start to see an evolution within NFTs.” The researchers argued collectibles like the famed Bored Ape Yacht Club could “lose relevance if they only serve as a profile picture or a ‘flex’ to the have-nots on how much you’re willing to spend on one.” Instead, NFTs should have a historical relevance or they need to be true art or provide tangible utility (that is, a specific function or use case) in order to obtain lasting value, they urged .

18011784,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=552687,1695560690,What The Drop In Spot And Derivatives Volumes Means For The Price Of Bitcoin,"It has been a quiet week of caution for Bitcoin traders in terms of price action. This caution has trickled into trading volume in particular, as volumes on major crypto exchanges for both spot Bitcoin trading and Bitcoin derivatives have fallen far below their levels at the beginning of the year. On-chain data from CryptoQuant charts have shown the daily spot and derivatives trading volume of Bitcoin has been steadily declining since the first quarter of the year. The question is, what does this collapse in trading volumes mean for the future price of Bitcoin? Related Reading: Polkadot Cross-Chain Bid Takes Flight As DOT Battles Uncertainty Decline In Trading Volumes Trading volumes this year have declined significantly from their highs in March during the Silicon Valley Bank fiasco. Since this period, the derivatives or futures market has fallen 96% and the spot market has fallen 98%. Bitcoin trading in particular, has been down by a significant margin the past week. Data from CoinMarketCap has shown Bitcoin spot trading volume has decreased by 33.67% in a 24-hour timeframe. Similarly, the spot exchange trade volume was shown by CryptoQuant data to be 9,627, down 81% from 50,692 at the beginning of the week. The situation looks even more glaring when you consider falling derivatives volumes as well. On-chain data collected by CryptoQuant indicates that the derivatives trade volume is currently at 108,852. This represents a decrease of 88% from the volume of 950,331 at the beginning of the week. The market cap of cryptocurrencies is currently at $1.03 trillion. Chart: TradingView.com What Does This Mean For The Price Of Bitcoin? When activity in these markets dwindles, it signals a lack of interest from institutional traders and retail investors. With interest seeming to wane, the next few weeks could determine Bitcoin’s near-term direction. As the largest cryptocurrency in the world, this could also determine the direction of the majority of the crypto market. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $26,556. Without much trading activity to drive prices up, Bitcoin could continue trading sideways or even face downward pressure. The next major support for Bitcoin is at $25,000, and a fall below this price could indicate a prolonged bearish trend with increased selling pressure. Related Reading: XRP Forecast: Is A Retreat Below $0.5 Likely Before October? Another way this could go is the lower price eventually leading to higher volumes again as investors see an opportunity to buy. According to a social media post by crypto analyst Captain Faibik, Bitcoin could reach as low as $23,000 in October before breaking out to reach $34,500 by early next year. Similarly, Didar Bekbauov, founder and CEO of Bitcoin joint mining business Xive, stated that the price of Bitcoin could soar past the year-to-date (YTD) price of $31,700 while speaking to Bitcoinist.

In just six short weeks since its launch, Base’s total value locked (TVL) has skyrocketed to nearly $400 million. This rapid rise in use and popularity has even seen it recently overtake the Solana blockchain in TVL. Coinbase’s Layer 2 Scaling Network TVL Overtakes Solana Base operates as a layer 2 network on Ethereum launched by Coinbase in collaboration with Optimism to offer a safe, low-cost, developer-friendly way to build on-chain. Since its launch, Base has managed to find a strong market fit, allowing it to quickly penetrate the crypto market. However, this hasn’t been without some hiccups. Related Reading: XRP Forecast: Is A Retreat Below $0.5 Likely Before October? Before its public launch, Base had some glitches, which developers were able to rectify quickly. Earlier this month, the network faced another setback as block production unexpectedly stopped for 45 minutes. According to DeFi TVL aggregator DefiLlama, Base’s TVL has risen +111% in the past month to now holding more than $370.29 million. Last week, Base’s growth saw it blow past the Solana blockchain in terms of transaction volume. This growth has continued, and the Layer-2 network has now moved ahead of Solana whose total value locked (TVL) dropped by 12.22% in the last month to $310 million. Also, this places Base’s TVL ahead of other popular chains like Cronos, Bitcoin, and Cardano. Crypto market cap currently at $1.03 trillion. Chart by TradingView.com Base Sees Massive Growth In Just 6 Weeks Base’s growth kickstarted with Aerodrome, a decentralized exchange, which deposited $190 million on the network after its launch. Base’s growth can also be attributed to the popularity of Friend.tech, a decentralized social app. With a current TVL of $38.6 million, Friend.tech is one of the projects native to Base with a the largest stake. Other projects with a considerable stake in TVL include Stargate, Curve DEX, and Compound V3. At the moment, Ethereum continues to lead the pack in terms of TVL. However, the coming months will be crucial in determining whether Base can sustain its momentum and continue gaining mainstream traction. At its current trajectory, Base could surpass $500 million in TVL in the coming weeks and solidify itself as a leader in layer-2 scaling networks. Related Reading: Polkadot Cross-Chain Bid Takes Flight As DOT Battles Uncertainty According to BaseScan, the number of daily transactions on Base reached a new high of 1.88 million on September 14, as reported by BaseScan. The layer-2 network has now processed more than 40.31 million transactions at the time of writing. (This site’s content should not be construed as investment advice. Investing involves risk.
