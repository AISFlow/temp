42403084,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAded9O,1563571828,"Token Startup Founder Took Steps to Sue Lubin, ConsenSys for $13 Million","Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin could soon be sued by a former employee, according to court documents filed in New York.  Harrison Hines, former head of Token Foundry at Lubin’s Brooklyn-based venture studio ConsenSys, began the process of filing a legal complaint in June against his former employer. The complaint seeks more than $13 million for alleged fraud, breach of contract, unjust enrichment and unpaid profits.  According to the summons from Hines’ lawyer:  “The relief sought is monetary damages in the amount of $12,827,000 on the contract, quasi-contract and fraud claims plus $404,783 in unpaid profits.”  Lubin’s legal representation responded to the summons by clarifying which counsel might represent the defendants in this case. The details of the case, along with the upcoming dates, are still unclear. The plaintiff, Hines, has yet to follow up with a formal lawsuit and the deadline for such paperwork has since passed. This may mean that legal representatives for both parties are pursuing a prospective agreement outside of court.  Hines could not immediately be reached for comment; requests sent to ConsenSys were not returned as of press time.  Launched  in April 2018, Token Foundry was the division, or ""spoke"" of the ConsenSys ""hub,"" responsible for promoting token sales and pitching token-design services to clients. The fees for consulting services often included a portion of the newly minted tokens in addition to a percentage of proceeds from the sales which Token Foundry helped launch, according to a person familiar with the matter who requested anonymity.  As CoinDesk previously reported, the spoke projected more than $50 million in revenue for 2018 and is widely believed to have fallen short of that goal. Top clients included the $13.4 million sale for Dether, which allowed physical shops to sell cryptocurrencies, Virtue Poker’s $18.5 million token sale and the token sale for geolocation startup FOAM, which raised $16.5 million in August, just weeks before Hines was let go.  The source described Hines as a former member of Lubin’s “inner circle.”  As recently reported by CoinDesk, conversations around equity have been a point of contention for many ConsenSys staffers. Among those are Token Foundry employees who were laid off in late 2018, sources said.  In early 2019, ConsenSys restructured its token-centric division as ConsenSys Digital Securities, calling the business in a press releasehttps://content.consensys.net/wp-content/uploads/CS_Satis-Press-Release.pdf “a premier advisory firm for Security Token Offerings (STOs) and digital asset structuring.”  Joseph Lubin speaks at Consensus 2019, photo via CoinDesk archives",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION | SPONSORED | TOKEN SALE,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/07/19/token-startup-founder-took-steps-to-sue-lubin-consensys-for-13-million,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b7c2942749ac72d8185f35b1b0c468bba88b3851-1600x900.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403083,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAded8P,1563570023,"Global Accounting Firm KPMG Partners with Microsoft, R3 on Telecoms Blockchain","KPMG, a multinational accounting firm, is partnering with software firms TOMIA, Microsoft, and R3 to develop a blockchain for telecom settlements.  One of the “big four” accounting firms, KPMG has pursued industry-specific blockchain pilots in the past, always with an eye to settling cross-border, or network, complexities.  The latest partnership, with two distributed ledger (DLT) industry leaders, Microsoft and R3, continues in the vein of resolving the issues that arise from multi-party connections. Specifically, KPMG is looking to address the hard data issues that will arise from 5G connectivity.  The company states that “international mobile data roaming revenues are expected to reach $31 billion in 2022, with an average annual growth rate of eight percent.”  It’s that accelerating use of international data that Arun Ghosh, Blockchain Leader at KPMG, addressed in a blog post:  “While we will be able to consume more data more quickly and across more locations than ever before in this next wave of telecom advancement, it is becoming increasingly complex for telecom companies to track and settle interchange fees.”  The blockchain being piloted aims to reduce the future costs, number of disputes, and time involved in telecom settlements caused by “billions of mobile interactions flow[ing] through hundreds of connected networks managed by dozens of customers and suppliers.”    Current inefficiencies    It’s not just future costs the business partnership is looking to salve, but the current inefficiencies in the market. Settlements and reconciliations are currently handled manually, and can take up to a month to complete, Ghosh said.  Currently, he said, a huge amount of data is generated is around mobile devices including the metadata of where a call originates and terminates, the conditions of a user’s contract, and billing information, that must be authenticated by at least two parties if cross-service operations occur.  “The three pillars of settlements – the subscribers, their contracts, and amount of data generated – can all be integrated on a private, permissioned ledger to be seen and verified by the telecom operators,” he said. In fact, KPMG now reconciles much of that information automatically with smart contracts they designed.  In the business arrangement, Ghosh said KPMG has taken the design and execution lead for the project. While Microsoft acts as the principal architect, R3’s Corda acts as the backbone of the operation, and TOMIA brings a layer of telecom knowhow through representing 40-odd global operators.  Before this blockchain initiative, KPMG had advised telecom operators on capital-efficient deployment of 5G networks, cyber security, privacy, and data protection, and revenue recognition and lease accounting.

It's about education and evangelizing.”  Minter has spent close to 30 years in enterprise software in forms like SAP, Oracle and Docker. Since joining R3, she sees the firm's vibrant open-source community as a natural place to convert users to the commercial version.  “Open-source [users] are fabulous targets for us to talk to about taking them to the next level. Naturally, the enterprise version comes into play as you talk about solving business problems,” she said.  Revenue growth  The Corda open-source community has burgeoned in the last year or so with many enterprises experimenting with the code and an ecosystem of ""CorDapps"" enjoying a life of its own.  Opting for the Corda Enterprise version brings the added perks of 24-hour support five days a week, predictable release schedules, high availability, and support for industry-standard enterprise databases, said R3 managing director Charley Cooper.  “It includes the world’s only Blockchain Application Firewall, which enables the platform to be deployed inside corporate data centers and is optimized for use within these highly demanding IT environments,” claimed Cooper.  Last year, R3 CEO David Rutter said the company set revenue targets for 2018 of around $20 million and that the firm had missed its targets by around 10%.  As far as this year goes, Cooper said it’s not company policy to discuss revenue targets and commercial goals, but added:  “Our revenues are increasing year-on-year definitely, and we also have a very strong capital base which will fund our growth and provide runway for many years and we have ceased all fundraising. We have over 200 staff now and are bringing on several more people every week.”  David Rutter at Consensus 2017 image via CoinDesk archives",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/07/19/r3-taps-software-sales-vet-to-evangelize-paid-version-of-corda,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fac7c400e9aaa53de2c4cde7874a0d075d09fbb6-1112x624.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403089,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdedFI,1563548409,Ex-CEO of Crypto Exchange WEX Arrested In Italy,"Dmitri Vasilev, the former CEO the now defunct crypto exchange WEX, was arrested Friday in Italy, the BBC's Russian Service reported.  The publication cites Vasilev’s acquaintance and two anonymous investors in WEX who told BBC about the arrest. The attaché of the Russian embassy in Italy, Dmitri Gurin, declined to provide any details, as did the Italian financial police (Guardia de Finanza).  WEX was launched in 2017 as a successor of also defunct exchange BTC-e, whose alleged operator, Alexander Vinnik was arrested in 2017 in Greece and now facing extradition to the U.S., France or Russia.  The year of frozen funds  WEX was launched by Russian citizen Vasilev and operated for a year, until it froze withdrawals in July 2018 and hasn't restored normal service ever since. The troubles started soon after Vasilev tried to sell WEX to Dmitri Khavchenko, a militia fighter in the war in Eastern Ukraine.  Khavchenko told CoinDesk last year that WEX's admin (who, like the rest of the support team, was anonymous) didn't like him as the new owner and disappeared with the keys.  He also said at the time that the purchase deal was complete. Khavchenko later changed the official owner of the Singapore-registered exchange to his daughter, Daria, he also told CoinDesk.  In the meantime, over the summer and fall of 2018, almost $19 million worth of ether moved from the exchange's cold wallets to the popular crypto exchange Binance.  Responding to the outcry on Twitter, Binance CEO CZ said that WEX's accounts on Binance had been frozen. The fate of those funds is unclear since then.  Police step in  Users, mostly from Russia and neighboring countries, who were unable to get back their crypto and fiat deposited with WEX, started filing police reports in the fall of 2018. According to BBC, the Kazakhstan national police started a criminal investigation of Vasilev based on one such report, as well as the police of the Russian city of Tolyatti, which started a separate preliminary investigation.  The users even wrote an open letter to Russia's president Vladimir Putin, asking for justice and their money back, the Russian crypto media site Forklog reported in April. The users were notified that the letter was then passed to Russian police headquarters.  In March of this year, the auditing firm PwC reported that two Iranian citizens, Faramarz Shahi Savandi and Mohammad Mehdi Shah Mansouri, who are said to have created the SamSam ransomware, had been using WEX to launder over $6 million collected in ransom payments.  BTC-e was earlier linked to the theft of bitcoin from the storied crypto exchange Mt.Gox. According to a Wall Street Journal report, ""BTC-E appeared in 60 to 70 percent of all criminal cryptocurrency cases through 2016."" Both BTC-e and WEX were slow to introduce know-your-customer procedures and had anonymous support teams.

The filing was made under categories related to computer programs, such as ""downloadable electronic money computer program,"" ""electronic money card,"" ""electronic encryption device,"" and ""IC card with electronic money function.""  However, when contacted, a Samsung representative told CoinDesk that the tech giant was not behind the application.  ""We don't work this way,"" they said.  While the trademark application does not specifically state whether it's related to blockchain or cryptocurrency, the filing follows CoinDesk's previous report that Samsung is developing its own blockchain using ethereum tech, and may eventually issue its own cryptocurrency, possibly called ""Samsung Coin.""  In a possible clue as to their motivation for the filing, the same individual has previously tried to lodge trademarks relating to cryptocurrency work by other major technology companies.  The KIPO database shows that Kim Nam-jin also filed an application on July 10 seeking to trademark ""ThinQ Wallet.""  However, on July 2, LG Electronics, also based in South Korea, filed trademark applications both in South Korea and in the U.S. for ""ThinQ Wallet.""  Based on the LG application details, the wallet would provide a variety of mobile services including ""software platform for blockchain"" and ""mobile electronic wallet for cryptocurrency.""

The thieves attacked at 10pm on July 15, according to the Birmingham Mail.  Recorded and posted to Facebook, the daring late-evening attack netted the thieves what looked like, at first, either lengths of receipt tape from a bitcoin ATM - an ATM owned by the decidedly unappetizing Shitcoins Club - or, less likely, an decidedly pessimistic length of toilet paper.  The truth, however, is more mundane. Adam Gramowski, CEO of Shitcoins.club, said that the ATM in Birmingham was a smaller model and that they had run it since September, 2018. He said that the thieves were planning to use a cable to pull the ATM from its moorings and out into the street.  ""It is a two-way machine capable of conducting sales and purchases of four different cryptos: BTC, ETH, LTC and DASH. We sell cryptos for GBP and EUR,"" he said. ""I can confirm that our Birmingham self-service shop was broken into on July 15. However, the robbers were spotted by our CCTV operator in time and were unable to penetrate our countermeasures. The ATM was not damaged, it will be up and running in no time. Damages to the shop are minimal. Also, the line or rope seen behind the car has nothing to do with the ATM. We do not store Cryptos on the ATM’s hard drive or provide cold storage facilities for our customers. That line was brought by the robbers to facilitate the robbery.""  Birmingham welcomed the first bitcoin ATM in the city in 2017, crowing that ""Birmingham gets first Bitcoin ATM - the internet currency used by criminals on 'dark web'.""

42403095,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdedLC,1563537606,What It’s Like to Review Bitcoin's Code,"On June 19, Chaincode developer John Newbery gathered a group of developers to examine a proposed change to bitcoin's code.  Taking place via Internet Relay Chat (IRC), the topic was whether the change, which would help prevent a group of rogue miners from speeding up the rate at which bitcoin's blocks are produced, is a positivehttps://bitcoin-core-review-club.github.io/15481.html one with limited security risks or adverse impacts.  Newbery's goal, then, is to pass on what he knows about reviewing such code.  Was this 'timewarp attack' stopper a solid change?  ""The timewarp exploits this by pushing the difficulty adjustment block way into the future, and then the next block back into the present,"" Newbery wrote, explaining the attack vector.  But the fact that Newbery is even holding these sessions at all can be seen as a sign of the maturity of bitcoin's developer community, as this is one example of how project's top coders have been hard at work making the project more inclusive. The process for reviewing code perhaps hasn't been discussed so openly and in-depth before.  Newbery started the Bitcoin Core Review Clubhttps://bitcoin-core-review-club.github.io/ to give coders tips on how to figure out how to review a change and determine if it's beneficial for the cryptocurrency. Meetings transcripts are now posted on the website every week.  That this is possible is because bitcoin's code is open source, residing on GitHub for anyone with an internet connection to look at – or even change. This process has driven the project from code people once called a ""monolithic blob"" to software that’s easier for easier for developers to read with less critical bugs. People are constantly trying to improve it, with the lofty end goal of making it a worthy code base for the future of money.  So, it's also possible to be one of the people who contributes to bitcoin's code. Unlike proprietary code, its code anyone can see and use - what's known as ""open source.""  One reason it’s called “programmable money” is that unlike other digital money, anyone in the world with the right knowledge can try to add new code features to the money. One of the ways to learn the codebase is to review and test the code programmers submit, to make sure it actually works, and doesn’t introduce a bug or — an unfortunate reality — accidentally split the bitcoin network in half.  But looking through the pages of code and hundreds of proposed changes, it’s hard to know where to start.  ""This weekly IRC club is for people who want to help review Bitcoin Core pull requests but find the process intimidating,"" the website for the club explains, continuing:  ""Reviewing and testing pull requests is the best way to start contributing to Bitcoin Core, but it's difficult to know where to start. There are hundreds of open pull requests, many require a lot of contextual knowledge, and contributors and reviewers often use unfamiliar terminology.""  As such, while the code for this digital currency is out in the wild for anyone to look at or change, it's not necessarily easy to do so. It takes practice to know what to review.  Here’s what the process is like.  Anyone can do it  To begin, users can go to GitHub, a website that hosts all sorts of open-source code projects. There’s one specifically for Bitcoin Core, the underlying bitcoin software implementation that most users run.  You’ll notice that there's a lot to GitHub, but reviewing the code is basically looking at ""pull requests,"" a series of changes that developers across the ecosystem have submitted for review.  In other words, there are 300 changes that haven't been reviewed enough yet to be officially added to the codebase, from making the documentation describing the code easier to read to improving the performance of bitcoin.  At this point, developers are trying to decide whether these changes should be approved. The problem is that there are limited developers who have enough experience reviewing code changes to determine whether they should be officially added to the codebase. Because of this, one Bitcoin Core contributor once described the list of pull requests as a “graveyard of cool ideas.""  That's why Newbery is trying to help along this process.  So, how does one actually go about reviewing a change? As Newbery describes on the club website, there are a few key steps to get started, like looking through the “contributing to Bitcoin Core guide” and tinkering with C++, the programming language Bitcoin Core is written in.  The next is simply picking a change to review. With over 300 pull requests alive and kicking, where does one start? The best picks for someone who doesn’t know the codebase yet are code changes that are specifically labeled “good first issues.”  When the preliminaries are over with, the developer needs to “clone” the repository, or use git to make a copy of the codebase to their computer so they can test that the change works as planned.  It only takes a simple command to copy the whole codebase to your computer.  From there, you can review the pull request. Said developers should then run all of the “tests,"" to make sure the code change doesn’t accidentally trip up another piece of code, then move toward reviewing the rest of the code.  Inside a reviewer’s mind  What do reviewers need to think about?  First, there are high-level concerns. Determining whether a change should be made, especially a critical one, is basically based on “rough consensus,” meaning most active contributors would agree a change should be pursued.  In another club meeting, Newbery saidhttps://bitcoin-core-review-club.github.io/16060.html:  “My thoughts about opening pull requests: no-one owes you a review. Anyone who reviews your code is doing you a favour. If you open a pull request, you're competing with other pull requests for review time.”  “If in doubt about how useful other people think your pull request will be, feel free to ask in #bitcoin-core-dev, or by directly asking other contributors,” Newbery added, referring to another IRC group where developers can ask questions related to Bitcoin Core development.  That said, developers don’t always agree on whether a change is worth adding or not. One week the group of developers focused on a contentious code change. Some argued the bad outweighed the good, while others still argue it could be useful.  But even if the idea is a good one in general, there are also lower-level concerns. Are there bugs? Does the code change come with tests that ensure the code change works as planned? These are the questions a lot of reviewing time is spent answering.  In the May 29 meeting (of which you can find the full transcript herehttps://bitcoin-core-review-club.github.io/15741.html), for example, developers looked through a performance enhancement for the wallet portion of the bitcoin node.  A contributor going by the pseudonym 'Ariard' led the meeting by going through the review process they've developed over time. “I tried first to identify which kind of PR it was: Doc, code style, buf fix, new feature, or test addition. Because [in my opinion] knowing this fact is going to guide how you read commits first time, how much time you will need for review and which kind of tests needed,” the developer said.  Another reviewer pointed out that they noticed an improvement just by checking how long the code took to run – before and after. “My 10000 key import went from 8 minutes to 3 seconds xD,” said another user going by the name 'jb55.'  The transcripts of the meetings are further littered with various other tips about how to streamline this process and make it easier to review, with more meetings to be scheduled in the future. The next couple of sections will be led by bitcoin technical writer and contributor David Harding.

42403098,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdedMB,1563534073,Short of Target: Bitcoin's $1K Rally Leaves Bear Bias Intact,"View  Bitcoin's short-term outlook will remain bearish as long as prices remain below $11,080 resistance. A break above that level would invalidate bearish lower-highs setup.  The bulls may have a tough time forcing a break above $11,080 amid news of BitMEX exchange facing a regulatory probe and talks of harsher crypto regulation.  Prices could drop below $10,000 in the next 24 hours with daily chart indicators continuing to report bearish bias.  A weekly close (Sunday, UTC) above $12,000 is needed to revive the bullish view.      Bitcoin (BTC) has rallied sharply in the last 24 hours, but the outlook remains bearish with prices holding below key resistance around $11,080.  The premier cryptocurrency jumped from $9,200 to $10,400 in just 40 minutes during the U.S. session yesterday, contradicting the case for a drop below $9,097 put forward by multiple rejections at $10,000 in the Asian trading hours.  Price rose further to $10,800 at 23:45 UTC, but closed at $10,648, leaving the crucial resistances of $10,759 (monthly opening price) and $10,850 (daily chart resistance) intact, as tweeted by popular analyst Josh Rager.  Rager wants to see BTC climb $10,850 before calling bullish revival. While that argument has merit, a much stronger confirmation of the bullish breakout would be a high volume move above $11,080.  That would invalidate the bearish lower highs pattern created during the sell-off from $13,200 to $9,049, as seen in the chart below.  Bearish lower highs  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $10,330 on Bitstamp, having clocked highs above $10,770 at 08:00 UTC.  The cryptocurrency has come under pressure in the last hour or so amid news that the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is probing BitMEX, which offers trading of cryptocurrencies with up to 100-times leverage and products such as futures and swaps, over whether it allowed Americans to use its platform.  The latest CFTC probe could heighten regulation fears that have gripped markets over the last few days, making it difficult for BTC bulls to force a break above $11,070.  Technical charts are also calling a break below $10,000.  4-hour and daily charts  BTC is feeling the pull of gravity, having faced multiple rejections at the 50-candle MA on the 4-hour chart (above left) in the last 18 hours.  With bitcoin's fall back to $10,300, the bearish crossover of the 50- and 200-candle MAs has gained credence.  Further, the relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart continues to report bearish conditions with a below-50 print.  The Chaikin money flow index, which takes into account both prices and trading volumes, fell to 0.07 yesterday from 0.08, even though prices rose above $10,000. That divergence (marked by arrow) indicates the buying pressure weakened with the price rise and puts a question mark on the sustainability of the gains seen in the last 24 hours.  3-day chart  The 5- and 10-candle MAs have produced a bearish crossover and prices faced rejection at the descending 5-candle MA earlier today.  Further, the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) has turned bearish for the first time since December 2018, as discussed earlier this week.  All-in-all, BTC risks falling below $10,000 in the next 24 hours. On the downside, strong support is located at $9,097 (May 30 high). A violation there would expose the 100-day MA lined up near $8,100.  On the higher side, a high-volume break above $11,080 would invalidate the bearish setup.  That said, a weekly close (Sunday, UTC) above $12,000 is needed to confirm bull revival due to the fact that BTC has failed to close above that psychological level for three weeks in a row – a sign of buyer exhaustion noted earlier this week.

42403091,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdedGH,1563532812,New Jersey Takes Online Market to Court Over 2018 Crypto Token Sale,"The U.S. state of New Jersey is taking legal action over alleged securities violations by token-powered online rental marketplace Pocketinns.  New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir S. Grewal and the Bureau of Securities within the state's Division of Consumer Affairs announced Thursday that the state is pursuing a three-count lawsuit against the company and its president, Sarvajnya G. Mada, after the platform sold over $400,000 in claimed unregistered securities from New Jersey via its PINNS Token.  According to the announcement, Pocketinns sold the tokens for the ether (ETH) cryptocurrency in an initial token offering (ITO), but neither the firm nor Mada had registered with the bureau.  The sale took place from January 15–31, 2018, with 217 investors said to have bought PINNS tokens ""in violation of New Jersey’s Uniform Securities Law."" The state’s complaint alleges that the firm had hoped to raise up to $46 million though the offering of up to 30 million tokens, with a minimum investment of 1 ETH.  Mada is also alleged to have acted as an unregistered agent and, therefore, Pocketinns had employed an unregistered agent, also violation of the law, said the Attorney General's Office.  Attorney General Grewal said:  “Our securities laws apply to anyone offering or selling securities in this state, regardless of whether those securities are purchased with U.S. dollars or virtual currencies, and regardless of whether they are distributed in certificated form or through blockchain technology. The lawsuit we filed makes it clear that individuals selling cryptocurrency-related investment products in New Jersey must comply with the law or face serious consequences.”  The complaint also alleges that the defendants had sold the tokens without registering with the bureau on the basis of a federal registration exemption requiring those participating in the sale to be verified as accredited investors.  ""However, Pocketinns and Mada failed to take reasonable steps to ensure that the Pocketinns investors were accredited, thus causing the offering’s exemption to be inapplicable and requiring the PINNS Tokens to have been registered with the Bureau of Securities,"" the state claims.  Just 11 of the 217 investors who purchased PINNS had provided documentation to verify they were accredited investors, according to the complaint.  “By failing to take reasonable steps to verify that purchasers were accredited investors capable of bearing the increased risks associated with unregistered securities, the defendants violated the law and exposed investors to financial losses that could have been devastating,” said Paul Rodríguez, acting director of the Division of Consumer Affairs.  New Jersey is now seeking to permanently bar Pocketinns and Mada from selling securities in New Jersey, as well as to assess civil penalties against the defendants.

42403085,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdedAN,1563528308,Crypto Exchange BitMEX Under Investigation by CFTC: Bloomberg,"Updated (09:35 UTC): Added further details from Bloomberg's full report.      Seychelles-based cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX is reportedly being probed by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).  The news appeared in brief on Bloomberg Terminal soon before press time on Friday. That was soon followed by a report from Bloomberg citing sources who said the regulator is investigating whether the exchange has allowed U.S. traders to use its platform.  The CFTC considers cryptocurrencies like bitcoin commodities and has jurisdiction over derivatives such as futures based on cryptos. As such, BitMEX would need to be registered with the agency to allow Americans to trade such products in the U.S.  According to its website, BitMEX offers trading of cryptocurrencies with up to 100-times leverage and other products such as futures and swaps.  Bloomberg said the CFTC investigation is ""ongoing"" and may not lead to misconduct allegations.  The report adds that the CFTC declined to comment when contacted.  Just days ago, noted economist and crypto skeptic Nouriel Roubini attacked BitMEX, saying it ""may be openly involved in systematic illegality,"" again according to Bloomberg.  Roubini argued that, in providing such high leverage, the platform is exposing traders to too much risk.  Reportedly citing an anonymous blog, he also allaged that the exchange trades against its own clients and “skirts” anti-money laundering regulations.  BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes has previously said it never trades against clients.  Hayes also told Bloomberg this week:  “We continue to monitor all legal and regulatory developments around the world and will comply with all applicable laws and regulations; we reject any allegations of criminality, manipulation or unfair treatment of our customers, who are at the center of everything we do.”  Image via CoinDesk archives",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/07/19/crypto-exchange-bitmex-under-investigation-by-cftc-bloomberg,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c4c9ed2457de90d2b7fa7a03492d704a6484bce5-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Speaking at an event on the island Thursday, Wozniak said he has invested in the EFFORCE project – which enables investors to back energy efficient projects around the world – and become a co-founder.  According to the Malta Independent, Wozniak explained that the firm aims to bring money savings on energy, but also help the environment, a factor he said was important to him.  Blockchain, he continued, will bring improvements to energy use and reduce consumption without consumers needing to change their habits.  Wozniak also said the Maltese government's enthusiasm for blockchain was a key factor in the company setting up shop there.

As suggested, the Mediterranean island nation has been extremely proactive when it comes to blockchain. A year ago, its government passed a trio of bills relating to cryptocurrency and blockchain, aimed to attract businesses in the space.  The effort has been working, with notable crypto exchanges such as Binance and OKCoin now working in Malta.  The government has also been moving to adopt the tech in administration, developing a blockchain strategy, and putting the tech to use in storing academic qualifications and rental contracts.

The price of bitcoin (BTC) jumped by more than $1,000 in the expanse of 30 minutes yesterday, with the rest of the market following suit, rising between 5-20 percent, while Litecoin (LTC) outperformed all other top 10 crypto by market capitalization.  LTC is up 13 percent over a 24-hour period and is currently changing hands just above the $100 resistance at $100.72.  Top 10 at CoinMarketCap        For now, the broader markets are flashing green, a welcome sight for the bulls who managed to stem the bleeding across the board with BTC defending a key area above $9,000 at 11:00 UTC yesterday morning.  As a result names such as EOS, Binance Coin (BNB), Ether (ETH) and bitcoin SV (BSV) are up between 7-12 percent respectively. Litecoin has been most involved with the rebound rally and is leading the pack by an extra 1.02 percentage points.  Hourly chart  As can be seen in the hourly chart above, LTC has resumed its previous price action, witnessed July 11 to July 14, which shows a rough $8 consolidation range.  Consolidation is the term for an asset or stock that is neither continuing nor reversing a larger price trend. Consolidated assets or stocks typically trade within limited price ranges and offer relatively few trading opportunities until a clear pattern emerges.
