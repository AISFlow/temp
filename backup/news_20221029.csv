3504240,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=508315,1667080826,"Chainlink Price Consolidates, How Long Will The Bulls Stick Around?","Chainlink price has been moving sideways over the past day. In the last 24 hours, the coin has only increased by 0.4%. Broader market price sentiments have crept in and many major altcoins have followed suit. In the past week, Chainlink has gained close to 6%. It continues to struggle within the $7 price zone. For the coin to see bullish force yet again, it is imperative that LINK travels above the $8 price level. The technical outlook of LINK has also indicated that bullish strength has started to exit the market. Demand for the altcoin has fallen, which has caused sellers to increase in number. Despite the recovery that Chainlink price registered in the past week, the coin has not experienced positive buying strength. This emphasized that LINK has to move past its next resistance mark for demand to increase on the chart. If buying strength continues to remain low, Chainlink will soon visit its closest support level. Currently, the altcoin is trading at an 86% low from its all-time high, which it secured in the month of May 2021. Chainlink Price Analysis: One-Day Chart LINK was trading at $7.14 at the time of writing. The altcoin has been moving sideways over the last 24 hours. This could prove difficult for the bulls as demand for the coin continues to decline. Chainlink has to break past its overhead resistance of $7.36 and $7.71 to reclaim the $8 level. Once LINK starts to trade at the $8 level, the bullish momentum can re-enter the market. Continued consolidation will cause Chainlink to move down to its local support line of $7 and then to $6.72. The coin might start to oscillate between these two levels if that happens. The amount of Chainlink traded in the past session declined, which meant that sellers were back in the market. Technical Analysis Buying strength of Chainlink has consistently remained low for this month. The coin barely registered an increase in buying strength in the last several weeks. The Relative Strength Index was below the half-line despite an uptick, which meant that sellers were still greater in number as compared to buyers. Chainlink price was below the 20-SMA line as demand for the coin fell, and sellers were driving the price momentum in the market. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Corrects But This Level Could Trigger Fresh Increase The other technical indicators, however, indicated that buyers could make a comeback. The chart displayed the buy signal for the altcoin. Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicates the strength of the price momentum and the price direction of the altcoin. The MACD underwent a bullish crossover and formed green histograms above the half-line, indicating that those were the buy signal for Chainlink. If buyers act on it then the coin can have a chance to redeem its bullish price momentum. The Directional Movement Index also points at the price direction and the strength of the same. DMI was negative as the -DI line was above the +DI line. The Average Directional Index was below the 20-mark, which meant that the current price momentum lacked strength.

The price of DOGE has increased 150% from $0.0594 to 15 cents since Tuesday – with the price surging 74% in the past 24 hours alone, CoinDesk data shows.  With the rally to six-month highs, DOGE has replaced Ethereum competitor Cardano's native token ADA as the sixth largest cryptocurrency in the world. At press time, DOGE, which was started as a joke in 2013, had a market cap of about 17.5 billion, while ADA had a market value of $14.5 billion.

Bitcoin Exchange Inflow Mean Has Observed Two Spikes In The Past 24 Hours As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the two exchange inflow mean spikes amounted to around 21 BTC and 17 BTC respectively. The &apos;exchange inflow mean&apos; is an indicator that measures the mean amount of Bitcoin being transferred to the wallets of centralized exchanges per transaction. It&apos;s different from the normal inflow metric in that instead of simply measuring the total number of coins flowing into exchanges, it tells us how large the average transaction to exchanges has been recently. When the value of this indicator is high, it means investors are depositing a lot of BTC to exchanges right now. Such a trend can be a sign of dumping in the market. Related Reading: Dogecoin Records Over 41% Gains Following Market Recovery On the other hand, low values of the metric suggest there isn&apos;t much selling pressure in the Bitcoin market at the moment.

The Scoville Testnet’s fourth and final phase, Cayenne, was released by the Chiliz team on October 24. A new developer’s guide and associated GitHub repository were also made available. In addition to this, Chiliz has seen other positive changes. The token issued by the Italian Football Federation has just been offered on many cryptocurrency platforms. A few days ago, Chiliz also launched ChilizX, a token exchange specifically for Chiliz fans. The network’s native coin, CHZ, is experiencing strong bearish momentum as of this writing, despite encouraging indicators of growth for the network and the token. 𝐒𝐜𝐨𝐯𝐢𝐥𝐥𝐞 𝐓𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐧𝐞𝐭 𝐏𝐡𝐚𝐬𝐞 𝟒 – CAYENNE is LIVE! 🌶️ Introducing the Chiliz Chain 2.0 Developer Guide & GitHub repo 🧑‍💻🎉 All the information you need to start building a local node is now available ✅#ChilizScoville ⚡️ $CHZ — Chiliz ($CHZ) – Powering Socios.com ⚡ (@Chiliz) October 24, 2022 However, with the FIFA World Cup just around the corner, the question remains: will suffering befall CHZ? Or, will the cautious bulls finally find some respite? Related Reading: Why Bitcoin (BTC) Could Not Surpass Litecoin (LTC) In This Key Area The Technicals Aren’t Looking So Rosy CoinGecko reports that while CHZ has depreciated over the past 24 hours, it has gained almost 13% over the past week and 2.4% over the past two weeks. Long-term investors are responsible for this trend. An inverted triangle formed as a result of previous price activity, adding weight to $0.2078 as a point of imminent resistance. As the commencement of the FIFA World Cup is expected to drive up the price of CHZ, this could be an issue for long-term investors. As of this writing, the CMF index is 0.18, indicating that bulls continue to control the market. However, this positive CMF value could be surpassed by a bearish Stoch RSI cycle. The link between CHZ and BTC is also strengthening. The current correlation coefficient between CHZ and BTC is 0.49, indicating that CHZ will track Bitcoin’s price fluctuations relatively closely. Nevertheless, despite the bearish Stoch RSI cycle, the momentum indicator favors the bulls. Chiliz: Reluctance Unwarranted The charts seem to show that the bulls’ current reluctance is mostly unwarranted. The bearish Stoch RSI cycle could drag the price of CHZ below its present support of $0.1863, though. The exchange reserves of CHZ decreased by 4.3% in the past 24 hours, but increased by 13.77% in the past week, according to CryptoQuant statistics. In order for the bullishness to continue as the trading day progresses, CHZ must conclude with a lengthy bottom wick. Currently, this may be the case, as CHZ is trading at $0.1903 with a red candle that has a lengthy bottom wick.

The official announcement took place on Saturday at the PlanB Forum Bitcoin conference.  Bitkit is Lightning-compatible and leverages Synonym’s Slashtags protocol. Slashtags is a system that uses Bitcoin cryptographic seeds to create portable web profiles (that can be used across multiple platforms), automatically updated contacts, contact payment preferences and authentication without a password.

The use of Bitcoin cryptographic seeds (via Slashtags) to enable portability is what Synonym believes will set Bitkit apart from other Bitcoin wallets.  “Bitkit isn’t a typical Bitcoin app. Anyone can now take their digital lives with them wherever they go, obsoleting Big Tech’s walled gardens and data surveillance,” said Paolo Ardoino, CSO of Synonym, in a release provided to CoinDesk. Ardino is also the chief technology officer (CTO) of Tether, crypto’s biggest stablecoin by market capitalization.  The wallet app is available in limited public beta mode for both Apple and Android devices.

XRP struggles to surpass he crucial $0.53 resistance marker The altcoin is swinging between narrow ranges in terms of price movement Whales continue to accommodate despite previous selloff The asset’s trading data chart reveals it is trapped within a Fibonacci support and resistance region where it encounters strong challenge surpassing the $0.53 marker. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Market Cap Grows By Over $1 Billion In 24 Hours Source: TradingView Every time XRP tries to move past this certain price point, it ends up testing the $0.43 support level. This cycle has been ongoing for the altcoin since the month of September. Despite the recent rally of the crypto market, the virtual coin declined by 1.3% over the last 24 hours and is still down by 4.4% for the past two weeks. At press time, according to tracking from Coingecko, the digital currency is trading at $0.47. A bit of good news for investors is that its Relative Strength Index is within an ascending support line which denotes a bullish signal for the asset that is the subject of an ongoing court battle between Ripple Labs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Ripple Focusing On Development To Help XRP Despite being in a long-standing legal tussle, Ripple is turning its focus to network development activities that will help XRP recover from its losses. The company recently announced the launching of its third wave of $250 million creator fund which is open for all creators of both digital and physical non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Ripple said the application is open until December 30, 2022 and all interested applicants are welcome to try their luck for the millions worth of creator fund. This is still in line with the company’s goal of increasing network activity of Ripple users and also underscores their interest to grow their NFT market. Should Investors Buy XRP Today? As the crypto is not moving much in terms of price range, investors might opt to buy right now and hold their tokens while waiting for the next bullish market rally. XRP whales are doing the same, accumulating as much as they can even during the mini surge that helped the crypto space push its overall valuation back to over $1 trillion. It is, however, important to note that addresses holding more than 10 million tokens have sold their XRP and trimmed their balances. This would mean that while some big investors are buying, the others are selling, ensuring balance to the asset’s distribution. Some analysts believe it is wise to hold the asset for now as the Ripple Labs is on the verge of finally winning its legal battle against SEC. They are looking at this development as a catalyst to trigger an XRP rally that will finally break its bearish cycle.

SHIB went up by 10% since October 25 before its recent price correction Shiba Inu lost 2% of its value over the last 24 hours The crypto is still up by almost 8% for the past week In doing so, the Dogecoin spin-off crypto managed to upend weeks of being in a downward trend that’s been very brutal to the 14th ranked cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization. SHIB, however, wasn’t able to sustain its upward trajectory as it once again made a step back for the past 24 hours. At press time, according to tracking from Coingecko, Shiba Inu is trading at $0.00001070. It’s been down by 2% over the last day but is still up by 7.9% for the past week. Shiba Inu Price Chart Hints At Another Price Correction SHIB’s 12-hour chart shows price trend is swinging sideways and there is no definite consolidation on a bullish region. Source: TradingView The altcoin did manage to increase by up to 10% since October 25 but has suffered price correction over the last few hours. Its Relative Strength Index (RSI) was leaning towards a bullish movement during that time but the current price movement says otherwise. If Shiba Inu fails to rebound from this minor price dump, the crypto might find itself on a downward movement once again. It’s also a surprise that Dogecoin’s momentum is no longer helping SHIB right now considering DOGE witnessed a significant price surge just moments after Tesla CEO Elon Musk took over Twitter. Related Reading: Why Bitcoin (BTC) Could Not Surpass Litecoin (LTC) In This Key Area Three Main Hurdles For SHIB Frustratingly, Shiba Inu repeatedly tried and eventually failed to build up enough momentum to push its price to higher levels. Experts believe there are three problems that are standing in the way of SHIB to move even just an inch closer in realizing its developers’ dream to flip Dogecoin. The first issue is that its circulating supply remains highly concentrated as more than 63%of all available SHIB tokens are being held by just 10 wallets which could be owned by fewer than 10 individuals or all by one person. Shiba Inu still has limited case uses as of this time as its most significant use is being a method of exchange. Moreover, there are only 112 merchants that accept the altcoin as a mode of payment. The asset’s network development roadmap is also not clear as there is no definite direction for where it is headed. It’s probably one of the reasons why investors are veering away of the crypto, shifting their focus and resources to assets with well-planned path that ensures ROI and profit.

42411070,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giBVxg,1667048400,Generative Art NFTs Bring New Heat to Crypto Winter,"Amid the frigid conditions of the ongoing crypto winter, non-fungible token (NFT) trading volume has decreased substantially since the third quarter of last year. While the NFT boom brought about a wave of popular PFP projects and multimillion-dollar JPEG sales, these trends became less prolific as the NFT market appeared to lose steam.  But in late September one artist made $17 million from selling out of mint passes to his new generative art NFT collection – a promising sign that interest in the NFT market had been reignited by these algorithmic-based designs.  Tyler Hobbs, the artist behind the collaborative generative art experiment, sold 900 of these mint passes, each priced at 14 ETH (about $18,729 at the time). The project highlighted the concept of audience curation into a generative art collection – the QQL algorithm is open to the public but only mint pass holders can mint their favorite creations as NFTs and become a part of the official collection.  “I think the value [of the collection] is around the collector, contributing to the work itself and becoming part of the story of QQL and the line of artworks that are evolving over time,” Hobbs told CoinDesk.  Hobbs is well known for generating buzz around an NFT project and has become a household name in the generative art NFT space. His flagship NFT collection Fidenza was minted in June 2021 via generative art platform Art Blocks, and in the months since it has continued to swell in popularity. In August 2021, Fidenza #313 sold for 1,000 ETH ($3.3 million) and, according to data from NFT marketplace OpenSea, the collection’s trading volume has ballooned to over 53,000 ETH, or about $82 million.  Hobbs joins a growing number of NFT artists and collectors that are embracing algorithmic art and the evolution of digital art creation.  What is generative art?  Generative art is a method of creating work based on a set of instructions, whether it be analog or computational. As the art form has expanded, it has embraced the use of autonomous systems or algorithms to randomly generate content.  More recently, NFTs as a medium for artistic expression have brought these types of work and the artists behind them out from the shadows.  Jordan Kantor, artistic director of Art Blocks, told CoinDesk that generative art has been showcased through drawings and paintings throughout much of the 20th century. Yet, art movements in the 1960s, such as minimalism, along with the expansion of artificial intelligence and computing, helped propel generative art into the modern NFT space.  Specifically, he said Web3 technologies have “allowed for significant changes in the story of generative art,” and have opened up new pathways for artists to create and monetize their work. This includes building new tools for art creation, finding new ways to reach communities and developing new – and possibly more equitable – economic models.  Kantor added that merging generative art algorithms and blockchain technology can help artists to create “self-reflective work” that “most easily fits into the stories of contemporary art.”  Merging generative art and NFTs  As generative art continues to evolve as a medium, so too have the ways in which it has been used by NFT artists to enrich their communities and breathe new life into their artwork.  Emily Xie is the artist behind the Art Blocks collection Memories of Qilin, a code-based generative art project inspired by traditional East Asian art. Each output in the collection is an exploration of cultural folklore that leaves its interpretation up to the viewer.  “Part of the storytelling aspect of the series is this idea of collectivity and collective consciousness. We as a community are deciding the meanings of these pieces,” she told CoinDesk.  Xie, who studied art and obtained a master’s degree in computational programming, has successfully merged her two areas of expertise through generative art NFTs, and her Memories of Qilin collection has amassed a total trading volume of 3,055 ETH ($4.8 million) on OpenSea.  “I would do creative coding whenever I could, but I never imagined that there would be a way to actually live off of my art. So when I discovered NFTs for the first time it became possible,” said Xie.  Xie also noted that NFTs have helped new generations of collectors and creators discover generative art.  “[Generative art] has a very deep, rich history, but I think it has been at the margins of the art world for a very long time. What's interesting about generative art in the context of NFTs is that this medium has pushed generative art out to a wider audience,” said Xie.  Auction houses note a 'revival' of generative art  While NFT platforms such as Art Blocks or OpenSea have swaths of generative art collections on their platforms, traditional auction houses have also taken notice.  Christie’s, the 255-year-old auction house at the forefront of the NFT boom, recently established the NFT division of its auction house called Christie’s 3.0. Its inaugural NFT collection was a series of artworks by 18-year-old visual artist Diana Sinclair, made up of five still works and four generative art videos.  Nicole Sales Giles, director of digital art sales, told CoinDesk that generative artwork appeals to more “tech-savvy” buyers looking to build out their art collections with intricate pieces.  Auction houses have also been successful at bringing together classic works of generative art and new algorithmic designs.  In April, Sotheby’s conducted a $2.3 million sale of generative art, showcasing the works of artists Vera Molnar, a 98-year-old generative artist who began her career in the 1940s, as well as Charles Csuri, an artist who emerged in the 1960s and who is credited with pioneering computer art and technology. On the roster were several other artists, including Hobbs.  Of the collectors who purchased these works, 69% were new to Sotheby’s and over a third of bidders were under 40 years old.  ""[The sales data] shows that there is a real revival in this category. It's always been difficult to understand, mainly because of the coding and the artist's creative process that can become very 'techy' for more traditional collectors,"" Michael Bouhanna, co-head of digital art sales at Sotheby’s, told CoinDesk.  Bouhanna noted that while there’s an uptick in generative art sales and a greater focus in showcasing these types of digital art among auction houses, there’s still a need to educate collectors on the richness of this artistic medium.  “We really need to raise awareness to all types of collectors about this movement. So we do it through panels, creating relationships with some of the top collectors in the space and continuing to do new sales bringing in new and younger artists,” said Bouhanna.  Generative art is sparking conversations around creativity and collaboration  While conversations around NFTs have shifted to focus on long-term utility, advocates for generative art NFTs praise the unique creative process that occurs between the artist and collector. Hobbs explained that this is one of the reasons he chose to make his QQL algorithm available to the public for free.  Some may argue doing this diminishes the value of the generated artwork that makes its way into the official NFT collection. However, Hobbs sees it as an opportunity to inspire creativity in the community he has grown.  “Even if they could never afford a mint pass, they're able to create beautiful artwork with it and they become part of the artistic conversation, said Hobbs. “And, in their own way, they've influenced the story of QQL and the final set of artwork.”",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,"Cam Thompson, Eli Tan",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2022/10/29/generative-art-nfts-bring-new-heat-to-crypto-winter,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9143d5dc2a3ea345aaa09c8b7bdb9db4be0d8ec1-1440x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin Short-Term Holder SOPR Has Been Elevated Over The Past Two Days As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the short-term holders seem to be using the latest price rise for profit taking. The relevant indicator here is the “Spent Output Profit Ratio” (SOPR), which tells us whether the average investor is selling Bitcoin at a profit or at a loss right now. When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means the overall market is realizing some amount of profit currently. On the other hand, values below the threshold suggest the holders as a whole are selling at a loss Naturally, values of the SOPR exactly equal to one suggest that the investors are just breaking even on their selling at the moment. Related Reading: Why Crypto Market Fear Mirrors Lull In Volatility Now, there is a cohort in the Bitcoin market called the “short-term holders” (STHs), which includes all investors who have been holding their coins since less than 155 days ago. Here is a chart that shows the trend in the BTC SOPR specifically for this holder group over the last couple of weeks: The value of the metric seems to have spiked up in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As you can see in the above graph, the Bitcoin STH SOPR has been elevated above the 1 level during the last two days or so. This rise has coincided with the BTC price finally surging up after moving sideways around $19k for a long while. This suggests that these investors are using this opportunity to harvest some profits. Related Reading: The Inverted Bitcoin Chart Bears Don’t Wanna See | BTCUSD Analysis October 27, 2022 Such profit-taking is generally bearish for the price of the crypto, and as the chart displays, there were three instances of this kind of trend during the past two weeks. All of those profit realization sprees from the STHs resulted in the price going back down after a short-term rise. This time as well the BTC price has gone down from its high of $20.9k to as low as below $20.1k. before retracing back up some to the current level. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s price floats around $20.5k, up 8% in the last seven days. Over the past month, the crypto has gained 7% in value.

MATIC could rally more as the price creates more bullish bias breaking out of its descending triangle with good volume as the price could rally to $1. KLAY’s price remains strong on the daily timeframe above the 50 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) as the price aims for more rallies. The top 3 altcoin performers for the week have been MATIC, DOGE, and KLAY, considering how these altcoins held their key support and showed resilience in the early part of October with so many possibilities of a downtrend and losing their support to trend lower. The past few days have seen the crypto market has looked more decent, with the likes of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) showing some great price movement in recent times. With the price of DOGE, MATIC, and DOGE showing some great price actions, let’s look at these top 3 altcoin performers.

After trading in a range for weeks as the price appeared difficult to trade due to little to no volume to push the price higher as the price stagnated, the price of DOGE finally showed some movement after its rejuvenated strength as a result of the current market. Elon Musk Twitter takeover has positively affected the price of DOGE. The price of DOGE trades at $0.086, clearing key resistance and holding the price from rallying higher; we could see the price of DOGE going to a high of $0.1 Daily resistance for the price of DOGE – $0.1. Daily support for the price of DOGE – $0.068. Price Analysis Of MATIC On The Daily (1D) Chart The price of MATIC remains bullish, having rallied to a high of $0.95 after breaking out of its descending triangle with good volume. However, the price of MATIC faces resistance to the trend to the $1 region. The Fibonacci retracement (Fib) value of 78.6% indicates that MATIC’s price was rejected as it attempted to break above this key value. The $0.96 price corresponds to a Fib value of 78.6%. If MATIC closes above this level, the price could rally to $1 and possibly $1.2. Daily resistance for the MATIC price – $1. Daily support for the MATIC price – $0.85. Top 3 Altcoin Performers- Price Analysis Of KLAY On The Daily (1D) Chart The price of KLAY remains bullish, having rallied to a high of $0.28 after breaking out of its descending triangle with good volume. However, the price of KLAY faces resistance to the trend to the $0.3-$0.4 region. KLAY’s volume suggests if the crypto market maintains its structure, KLAY could rally to the high of $0.3-$0.4.

3478310,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4550659-quant-the-new-crypto-darling?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1667019408,Quant: The New Crypto Darling,"Summary Quant is a blockchain OS that aims to connect any and all blockchains. The coin has enjoyed a bullish run, recently breaking into the top 30 by market cap. Quant is still relatively new in the scene, but holds a lot of potential. Overview Quant (QNT-USD) was founded in 2015 by Gilbert Verdian with the vision of creating a fully interoperable blockchain environment. A lot of blockchains cannot operate with each other, which stands in the way of innovation. Quant is essentially a blockchain Operating System. The software connects different blockchain networks through its Overledger OS. In theory, this technology has the potential to create a completely integrated blockchain ecosystem. The lack of interoperability between blockchains has been one of the major obstacles to the fast adoption of crypto, NFTs, the metaverse and all imaginable systems and applications that can be built in Web3. Quant will also facilitate the transfer of value among different Distributed Layer Technologies (DLTs). With the technology Quant is building, organizations will be able to orchestrate transactions between different authorized DLTs. Quant's Interoperability Vision and the Overledger Operation System Quant aims to become the go-to protocol of Web3 just like TCP/IP became the protocol standard for inter-networking on the Internet. TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol; the invention of TCP/IP allowed siloed sections of the Internet to communicate with each other, no matter the location or operating systems used. Quant aims to connect different blockchain networks regardless of their consensus mechanism or distributed ledger. Blockchains at the moment are almost completely isolated from each other and find it difficult to interact. To interact with two blockchains at the same time, developers must understand how both blockchains work, and develop an application accordingly. Bridges to move tokens from one blockchain to another have been created by blockchain companies to facilitate this inter-chain interaction; bridges create wrapped tokens to replicate a token on another blockchain by locking the real token in a contract, exchange, or atomic swap. However, bridges are difficult to create, extremely complex and often vulnerable to devastating hacks. Quant's solution to the blockchain interoperability problem focuses solely on the information inside a blockchain transaction and doesn't care about the channel the transaction originated from. Quant uses Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to create the parameters that allow blockchains to exchange data with each other without having to know everything about the channel the data originated from or the sender of the data. The Quant network achieves this chain-agnostic data transfer method by using different layers in the data transfer process. The Transaction Layer: When transactions are initiated, this layer stores and queues them. This layer also performs the cross-consensus and transaction validation operations. The Messaging Layer: This layer takes care of the data transfer of smart contract data, metadata and transaction data. The messaging layer extracts the main information needed to process and send data. At this layer, Metadata is used to interpret and translate messages for each blockchain to understand. The Filtering and Ordering Layer: This layer checks if sent data and messages meet the requirement of the recipient channel. For example, a Multi-Chain Decentralized Application ((MAPP)) may accept only a minimum number of coins. If coins are below that minimum, the transaction will be declined. The Filtering layer does the job of checking beforehand if certain requirements are met. The flagship system developed by Quant Network, called Overledger Operating System ((OS)), allows developers to build MApps. MApps are decentralized applications that store data and transact on multiple blockchains or systems at once. According to Quant , Overledger is not another blockchain; Overledger sits on top of blockchains and provides a meta-gateway. The great thing about MApps is that they can be built using different blockchains. Quant will allow developers to easily be able to write code that interacts with all the blockchains in a cohesive way. Deploying Overledger for an organisation is very simple, it only takes 3 lines of code to connect to the API. Overledger also acts as a “node provider”, like Infura or Quicknode. Overledger offers access to all nodes, DLTs and databases created and managed by other users. Of course, QNT is the native token of QUANT, and it is necessary to carry out transactions. Quant Network has secured interesting partnerships, including a partnership with US software giant Oracle. In 2019, Quant Network was accepted into the Oracle Start-up Ecosystem . Technical Analysis The chart on QNT has given us some clear indications that the token may have bottomed already, but a large pull-back is still in the cards. QNT Price Analysis (Author's work) We can see that QNT completed a five-wave move-up in September, which took it all the way to $429. Since then, we have retraced all the way down to the 76.4% retracement, where we may have bottomed in June. Since then, we have formed a clear five-wave structure, and it looks like we are now in wave 4. Using trend-based fib extensions, we can see that wave 3 reached the 1.618 targets, and I'd expect the final wave 5 to take us all the way towards $253. Bear in mind, this would signify the end of an initial large degree wave I up, which means we should get a retracement in wave II that can take us back towards the $70 level. This would be the ideal entry in terms of risk/reward. Risks Quant is a solid and ambitious project, but its MApps will not likely take over DApps. Some developers would cite latency concerns as MApps first need to communicate with Quant's Overledger before data is routed by the filtering layer to the specific blockchain in the transaction; meanwhile, DApps work directly on-chain with no intermediary. Quant requires identity checks before a user can access its mainnet. This has been largely criticized by the crypto community. Overledger APIs are also not yet full-fledged; only options like ""Create and Sign a transaction,"" ""Search Addresses"", and ""Subscribe to Address Changes"" are currently available. Having ended its ICO in 2018, Quant has under-delivered in four years, which is a lot of time to develop a quality, full-fledged product. Some of Quant's partnerships are also stuck in the mud. Its 2020 announced partnership with Sia has not yielded any results in terms of products of active collaboration. Most of Quant's other partnerships are similarly ""stagnant."" Takeaway Quant has done a good job of marketing its brand, even without a real, working solution to the interoperability challenges it claims to solve. QNT has very attractive tokenomics. Its total supply is 14,612,493 QNT of which more than 80% are in circulation, and no further minting of QNT will occur. With almost all the existing supply in circulation, there is no inflation risk. Quant is highly hyped. It has enjoyed a good price rally as a result of the hype. Generally, in crypto, good hype equals good token price.

Over the past 24 hours, the coin has appreciated by 3%. In the last week, AVAX shot up in double digits, which helped the coin break its sideways trading. The bulls now have control of the coin, but the altcoin is expected to break past a few trading levels to ensure that the bullish momentum continues on the chart. The technical outlook was also on the side of the bulls because Avalanche had gained buyers ever since it started to move up on its chart. The demand for the altcoin has also helped AVAX to slowly climb above its resistance mark, which now acts as a support for the coin. The coin’s strong support was at $15 at the time, but once it broke through, there could be some resistance between the $18 and $19 price range. If demand for AVAX remains constant, it might manage to topple those levels, which could help the altcoin to break free from lateral trading. The global cryptocurrency market cap today was at $1.03 trillion, with a 0.8% negative change in the last 24 hours. Avalanche Price Analysis: One-Day Chart AVAX was trading at $17.76 at the time of writing. The altcoin has experienced significant resistance at the $17 mark, but the bulls have now managed to stay above that price level. To continue the bullish thesis, Avalanche has to move past the $18 price mark, which acts as the immediate resistance for the coin. There could be a chance of the coin experiencing a lack of demand at that price level. Once AVAX breaks past $18, it is a clear path to $20. On the other hand, if the price retraces, AVAX could briefly stay above the $16 price mark before it falls to the $15 price level. The amount of Avalance traded in the last session was positive, signifying that buying strength was also on the increase. Technical Analysis Buying pressure for Avalanche price registered a steep recovery on the one-day chart. Buyers came straight back into the market as AVAX logged gains. The Relative Strength Index was positive as the indicator barreled up above the half-line, signaling that buyers have taken over the altcoin. Avalanche price were also above the 20-SMA line, which is considered bullish due to increased demand. Buyers were driving the price momentum in the market. Related Reading: Solana Recaptures $30 Support; Here Is What To Expect Based On This Indicator Avalanche price also displayed buy signal for the coin on its chart, indicating that if buyers act on it, the coin can move north again. The Awesome Oscillator indicates the price momentum and the strength of the price movement. AO was positive as it pictured green histograms that also represented the buy signal for AVAX. Bollinger Bands show price fluctuation and the chances of further volatility. The bands were super constricted on the chart. This sign is often accompanied by explosive price action over upcoming trading sessions.

3476305,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=508370,1667015196,Dogecoin (DOGE) Climbs 44% In Last 7 Days As Other Cryptos See Correction,"While the crypto market faces a correction period, Dogecoin has been able to notch gains. The popular meme coin has boasted over 44% gains in the last week alone. The cryptocurrency currently trades at $0.086 with a 24-hour volume of $3,308,559,307. This makes it one of the top gainers in the past week. There are several reasons for DOGE’s price action. One of them is Elon “Dogefather” Musk’s Twitter acquisition. The news has recently been making rounds on social media that the Tesla CEO would finally close his Twitter deal. With him finalizing the acquisition today, Doge supporters are bullish about the future of the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Why Bitcoin (BTC) Could Not Surpass Litecoin (LTC) In This Key Area Doge Soars 12% On The Day After Market-Wide Correction The entire crypto market experienced corrections that saw several coin prices retract by as much as 10 percent. Dogecoin also experienced this correction and was down by 8 percent. However, DOGE has risen by 12% in the past few hours, recouping losses sustained during the market-wide slump. Dogecoin’s value has also increased by over 40% in the past week. Its trading volume has also increased dramatically within this period. Market cap-wise, Doge is the ninth-largest crypto, and its price of roughly $0.086 was the highest since August. According to CoinMarketCap, it has seen a trading volume of $3.3 billion in the last 24 hours. This means that more Dogecoin has traded hands in the last 24 hours than Solana or Bitcoin Cash. In fact, all meme coins (as per CoinGecko report) have increased in value by approximately 10% in the same timeframe. Doge has only experienced this much trading activity in 2022 three times. The first was when Elon Musk announced that he’d accept DOGE as a payment method for Tesla transactions back in January. The second time was when he announced he’ll be buying Twitter. And the last time was when he accepted the bid in August. Musk Takes Over Twitter: Plans For The Social Media And DOGE Yesterday, Dogecoin price increased by more than 21% after Musk visited Twitter’s San Francisco headquarters carrying a sink. Musk’s visit served as a clue that the takeover agreement would be finalized before the October 28 deadline. After Musk took full control of Twitter, several executives, including CEO Parag Agrawal and CFO Ned Segal, resigned. The head of legal, policy, and trust, Vijaya Gadde, and the general counsel, Sean Edgett, also resigned. Musk has assured Twitter’s workforce that a 75 percent layoff is not in the works.

Meanwhile, it’s unclear whether or not Musk will introduce Dogecoin on Twitter. However, the Dogecoin community expects Musk to make an announcement soon.

3471747,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=508310,1667005235,Polygon Price Could Aim For These Levels Before The Bulls Wane Off,"Polygon price (MATIC) has retraced on its chart as the broader market depicted weakness. Over the last 24 hours, however, the coin has managed to move up by 0.2%. In the last week, MATIC rallied by over 14%, pushing prices to break past multiple price ceilings. The altcoin is trading sideways on the one-day chart, but the coin is still optimistic. The technical outlook of the coin has continued to side with the bulls as demand for the altcoin noted an uptick over the past day. Buying strength also signified an increase, but this reading could be momentary as the bulls could lose steam if demand doesn’t remain consistent. Polygon price can eye its immediate resistance mark before the bullish steam finally wanes off. With Bitcoin slipping down on its chart, many altcoins have travelled south on their respective charts. Polygon is still among those altcoins that have displayed the presence of bulls on their chart. It is crucial for Polygon price to trade above the $0.96 mark if it has to maintain its positive price momentum. Polygon Price Analysis: One-Day Chart MATIC was trading at $0.92 at the time of writing. The altcoin has been moving sideways on its one-day chart. Polygon price has made a good recovery in the past week. However, it is important for the coin to move above its overhead resistance in order for the bulls to regain momentum. Immediate resistance for MATIC was at $0.96 and, moving past that, the coin could witness another resistance at $0.97 before it touches $1. If buying momentum fades, the support line for Polygon awaits at $0.86 and then straight to $0.80. The amount of MATIC traded in the last session noted an increase, signifying that the demand for the coin has climbed up. Technical Analysis The buying strength for Polygon registered growth again, showing signs of revival as the demand for the coin fell over the last trading sessions.
