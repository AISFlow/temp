Stratumn, based in Paris, received funding from French venture capital firm Otium Venture and Eric Larchevêque, CEO of bitcoin hardware wallet startup Ledger. The company’s founding team includes Richard Caetano, developer of the bitcoin price and news ticker app btcReport, and Stephan Florquin, a former developer for French bitcoin exchange Paymium.  The company is hoping to be an early entrant in the market for enterprise blockchain development, with a particular focus on the notarization of data. Stratumn utilizes an open standard called Chainscript that creates an audit chain for workflows, tying evidence of work performed and validated on the platform to the bitcoin blockchain.  The newly raised funds, according to the startup, will be used to expand its team to a dozen employees and complete work on Chainscript as well as a blockchain notarization tool it calls ‘Fossilizer’.  Right now, Stratumn is gearing its toolkit toward applications tied to the bitcoin blockchain, but in the future the startup sees its products being used for what it anticipates will be a future with many blockchains.  Caetano told CoinDesk:  ""We see a day where there will be millions of blockchains developed in the world, and we see this as a natural evolution of data technology.""  Road ahead  Stratumn hopes to capture some of that anticipated demand by offering both its existing products as well as future tools like block explorers and monitoring dashboards geared toward enterprise blockchain solutions.  Caetano told CoinDesk that the startup has already begun work with a hospital in Paris as well as a French banking company.  Further, Caetano said he sees Stratumn as acting as a connection point between permissionless blockchain networks like bitcoin and Ethereum, and permissioned networks operated by financial firms and businesses.  Currently, the Stratumn platform is in private beta, following a soft launch at the beginning of this month. Caetano said that the company hopes to complete this process by the end of the summer.  ""We're still shifting things, we're still refining things,"" he said.  Future projects include what Caetano described as a ""blockchain store"" similar to the cloud application platform Heroku. He characterized this work as early, with the new funding being used, in part, to begin fleshing out what that service might look like.  Looking ahead, the company is hoping raise additional funds in a Series A funding, building on the seed funding it has already raised.

42398968,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhn7F,1459361121,Microsoft Adds Ethereum to Windows Platform For Over 3 Million Developers,"Millions of Microsoft developers are now able to build decentralized applications using the Ethereum blockchain thanks to a collaboration between the software giant and ConsenSys, announced today.  By building Ethereum’s Solidity programming language for writing smart contracts directly into Mircosoft’s Visual Studio platform, developers will be able to build, test and deploy decentralized applications, or dapps, within an integrated environment they already know how to use.  But don't think this is a money play for either ConsenSys, or Microsoft, at least not yet.  In a conversation with CoinDesk, CEO of ConsenSys, Joe Lubin said that growing the number of developers using the distributed ledger technology was first and foremost about reimagining social, economic and political systems.  Lubin, who is also the co-founder of Ethereum told CoinDesk:  ""It’s in our best interest, and in our mission, to help with the adoption of Ethereum in all its different forms — public, private, consortium — and this just makes that that much easier.""  The ConsenSys integration with Microsoft uses smart contract programming language Solidity to let developers run programs on the Ethereum network, also called the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Announced today at Microsoft’s Build Conference in San Francisco, the new functionality was scheduled to go live this morning at 10am EST.  With Ethereum’s Solidity language, developers will be able to write applications using self-enforcing smart contracts that can theoretically execute as wide a range of business transactions as the coder can imagine.  Ethereum's cryptocurrency, ether, powers the applications, and is currently valued at about $11.60, with a market cap of over $900m. By comparison, bitcoin’s market cap is $6.3bn.  The EVM transactions — or smart contract executions as they may be more accurately called — can then be recorded on what ConsenSys described in a statement as a ""non-repudiable and authoritative"" record using either the public or private versions of the Ethereum blockchain.  Ethereum's room to grow  Until recently Ethereum adoption has been slow, even if it is accelerating.  For example, the number of Ethereum repositories on GitHub, a reflection of how frequently developers are using the distributed ledger in their projects has grown at an exponential rate since January 2014, from less than 10 to about 460 by the end of 2015, according to analysis conducted by venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.  Using the same methodology, we calculated that number has more than doubled to 997 repositories, in the past three months alone.  But when compared to bitcoin, where there are currently 7,647 bitcoin repositories in GitHub, there's plenty room to grow before Ethereum becomes a serious competitor.  Marley Gray, director of business development and strategy for blockchain at Microsoft thinks his company’s large pool of developers could change that. As of July 2015, when Microsoft launched its most recent version of Visual Studio more than 3.2 million developers were registered on the platform, and the gallery of tools had been downloaded 13 million times in the previous year.  ""This integration with Visual Studio will offer developers enterprise-grade solutions with advanced capabilities for teams working on blockchain smart contract projects of any size and complexity,"" Gray said in a statement.  While ConsenSys’ CEO said he doesn’t plan on making any money directly from the collaboration, he was clear in his conversation with CoinDesk that the effort to make it easier for developers to build dapps was no act of philanthropy.  Lubin said:  “We at ConsenSys are a for-profit entity and we are building products on [the Ethereum] platform. We are building professional services and consulting on that platform, so it makes it so much easier for us to offer that kind of an environment to our customers and using that environment we can offer further services.  Business of Ethereum  Based in Brooklyn, New York, the self-funded ConsenSys is currently generating revenue from deals it has closed with institutional clients. ConsenSys declined to share the names of its clients.  Currently, ConsenSys employs about 70 people around the world, 30 of which are based at their headquarters in New York City, Keys said. He estimates that 80% of the staff work on a full-time basis and are compensated through a combined equity and payment structure.  “Everybody’s a stakeholder,” he told CoinDesk. “It just depends on when they started.” Other factors that play into compensation include experience, project, and revenue generation, Keys added later.  ConsenSys also isn’t sharing its specific revenue numbers. But Keys said it has no intention of being profitable anytime soon.  ""We just want to keep hiring people. We’re at 70 now and if we find the right people we’ll hire immediately,"" he said.  For an idea of the growth rate the company expects, it plans to more than double the workforce by the end of 2016, employing 150 people on a full-time basis, Keys said.  Symbiotic relationship  ConsenSys' deal with Microsoft is a true collaboration, with neither party paying the other to be involved in any way, said Lubin.  Both companies have benefited elsewhere by working together. In November 2015, ConsenSys was the first company to join Microsoft’s Azure cloud-computing service designed to let other companies experiment in a sandbox environment with the distributed ledger technology.  As a result, Microsoft was able cut out its place in the blockchain industry as one of the largest early movers, and ConsenSys earned the credibility of partnering with a $427bn publicly traded company.  The relationship, Lubin thinks, will continue thanks in no small part to today’s news.  Lubin described Visual Studio to CoinDesk:  ""It’s one of the best software developer tools on the planet, and this [collaboration] is like adding the vocabulary to build different kinds of programs to your development repertoire.""

42398955,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhmuS,1459353941,Bitcoin Exchange Cointrader Shuts Down After Alleged Hack,"Canada-based bitcoin exchange Cointrader announced earlier this week that it was shutting down following what it claimed was a debilitating hack.  According to a notice posted to the service's website, the exchange has ""closed its doors effective immediately"". Unconfirmed emails sent to users and shared on social media claim that an internal audit showed “a deficiency of bitcoin"" in company wallets that was causing a delay in withdrawals.  The email explained:  ""This issue is currently under investigation and it is our intention to have the balance of your account settled as soon as possible. We sincerely apologize for this unfortunate inconvenience and will keep you posted on the progress of this issue. In the meantime, we have halted deposits, withdrawals and trading activity until this matter has been resolved.""  The closure follows months of low volume trading on the website, according to data published by market information provider Bitcoin Charts. Data shows the exchange had seen just 81.43 BTC (about $33,600) in trading volume over the past six months.  The incident wasn't the exchange's first run-in with trouble, as in early 2014, Cointrader had its customer and corporate bank accounts shut down by the Bank of Montreal, its former banking partner.  At the time, the move was blamed on a restrictive policy toward digital currency businesses on the part of the Canadian government. The Bank of Montreal has since gone on to support work on financial blockchain applications through the R3CEV-led banking consortium.  Cointrader and its parent company, Newnote Financial, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

42426721,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwIxh,1459349871,DTCC CEO Asks Blythe Masters for Blockchain Advice in Candid Moment,"In a more candid moment at the DTCC’s day-long Blockchain Symposium yesterday, CEO Michael Bodson asked Digital Asset Holdings CEO and former JPMorgan executive Blythe Masters for advice about the role his company should play as the financial system begins to adopt blockchain innovations.  The comments come at a time when many entrepreneurs and academics are envisioning a future where the emerging technology will replace traditional financial intermediaries, especially those that facilitate transactions in the capital markets.  When asked for advice, Masters was first flattered by the request, but quickly moved on to discuss the real threat she believes the DTCC faces from what could be a new wave of lower-cost providers of clearing and settlement solutions based on the blockchain.  Masters said:  ""I would say, as someone said earlier, ignoring or trivializing what other people are up to is a very dangerous trade. It makes you feel better when you dismiss your competitors. It feels good when you’re talking to yourself, but the risk of ignoring the opportunity is gigantic.""  Masters went on to discuss how such feelings initially made it difficult for her to see past the hype surrounding bitcoin to understand that the technology offered real innovations in the form of its underlying distributed ledger.  ""The reality is there was more going on under the surface, and the imperative is to stay focused on your competitive position, even if you’re the sole provider of infrastructure,"" she continued.  The conversation found Bodson talking about his first discussions with Masters on blockchain, at which time Masters had assured the CEO that the technology would not necessarily put the DTCC out of business.  Still, Masters emphasized the point that financial incumbents face a real possibility of ""losing"" in the transition to blockchain, as many media providers were removed by Internet innovations.  Overall, Bodson showed good humor and resilience in his remarks, positioning the conference as part of a strategy by the DTCC to embrace innovations and understand how it can best harness its expertise even as the specific technology solutions it offers may evolve.  In one of the more telling moments, Bodson said:  ""If anyone is going to disintermediate us, I’d rather have it be us than someone from the outside.""  The fireside chat capped off a day of discussions that included a diversity of participants from representatives of the White House to bitcoin and blockchain entrepreneurs.  The exchange followed news earlier in the day that the DTCC would embark on its first trial of blockchain technology with Digital Asset Holdings, using blockchain to expand its involvement in repo trades.

42426731,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwJJh,1459342975,Bitcoin Marketplace Purse Takes Page From Etsy in Expansion,"The online marketplace that lets its customers buy items from Amazon with bitcoin today started looking an awful lot like Etsy, the website that puts a wide range of vendors directly in touch with buyers.  Backed by some of the biggest names in bitcoin, Purse's launch of Purse Merchants, lets anyone sell almost anything in exchange for bitcoin. Almost.  The man in charge of helping recruit this new crop of vendors says the new business model is about more than just a new way for people to make money, it’s a way to grow the number people actually spending bitcoin in an organic way.  Purse community manager Thomas Hunt told CoinDesk:  ""This is a great way for people who don’t have bitcoin to try it out. If you have any items around the house you can open a shop and sell them for bitcoin.""  As of today, independent vendors can sell almost anything they want on the market. To make money on this new service, Purse charges a 1% fee to the vendor for each sale. There are no fees to list an item, and the customer’s funds are held in escrow until the purchase arrives.  For some perspective, Etsy’s charges 3.5% for every sale, eBay charges 4% to 9% and Amazon charges between 6% and 45%, based on the type of item or service being acquired.  New business model  As told in Michael J Casey and Paul Vigna’s book, “The Age of Cryptocurrency,” San Francisco-based Purse got its start in 2014 when its two founders, Andrew Lee and Kent Liu realized they could take advantage of arbitrage on Amazon gift cards by using them to buy items on the e-commerce market in exchange for bitcoin.  Amazon gift cards are used to buy items requested by Purse customers, who pay in bitcoin. Purse makes its money by charging fees to the buyer and on the arbitrage from business cards they buy from third-party gift card exchanges. The startup that was a member of Plug and Play’s first class to include bitcoin companies, and last month claimed to have processes $1m in monthly transactions.  Unlike the Amazon model, which frequently resulted in goods being purchased at a discount, there's no guarantee that the lower fees charged to vendors will be passed onto customers.  Like the shops of Etsy, Purse's vendors get to pick their own price. But Purse investor, Terrence Yang, of Yang Ventures, believes the vendor will likely end up choosing to pass on that savings as a way to differentiate his or her products.  Yang told CoinDesk:  ""This is the promise of bitcoin. You should be able to match buyer and seller without having to go through intermediaries.""  Curated market  When Purse’s founders first stared making plans to open their business model to other vendor they took a lesson from other bitcoin market places like PayIvy that let customers sell pretty much anything.  The market ended up being a gray market where hacked credentials to Hulu, Netflix and more could be purchased for $1, and was acquired in May 2015 for $260,000 in cash and stock.  ""Purse Merchants is going to be a curated marketplace,"" said Hunt.  Purse Merchants has been in beta for the past several months, with five companies testing out the Service, including airmattress startup Windcatcher, of Shark Tank fame, hardware bitcoin wallets Trezor and Ledger, and KangerTech which makes vaporizers to help quit smoking.  Based in San Francisco, Purse has raise $1.3m from Digital Currency Group, venture capitalist Roger Ver and Bobby Lee, CEO of BTC China, among others.
