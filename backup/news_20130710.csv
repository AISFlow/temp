42425020,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHlATh,1373481655,US law firm Nesenoff & Miltenberg accepts payment in bitcoin,"Manhattan law firm Nesenoff & Miltenberg LLP is now offering its clients the opportunity to pay their fees in bitcoin.  Marco Santori, senior associate at the firm, said a few of his clients asked whether they could pay using the digital currency, so the company looked at how they could work it into their bookkeeping.  ""It's our aim to provide our clients with the flexibility to pay us in their chosen form of currency, and it should come as no surprise that clients in the digital currency space often prefer to transact in digital currency.""  He went on to say that the company also wanted to adopt the 'practice what you preach' mentality – it represents bitcoin companies, so it made sense to show some allegiance to the currency.  ""We represent clients in the three market segments of the digital currency space, so that's those involved in payments, mining and businesses that see bitcoin as an investment vehicle,"" Santori added.  He admits part of the reason he has done so much work for businesses in the digital currency space is because there isn't a lot of competition out there.  ""There really aren't a lot of other lawyers who've dedicated time, resources and brainpower to figuring out a lot of these complex bitcoin and digital currency problems.""  This could change over the coming months, though, with an increase in bitcoin companies seeking legal advice as governments start to take a closer look at which, if any, laws and regulations apply to the space",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/07/10/us-law-firm-nesenoff-miltenberg-accepts-payment-in-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/147d2231f81bf44f9ca5bedfad712b1d2f6623f7-1000x632.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425029,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHlAnh,1373474348,Bitcoin and M-Pesa: Why money in Kenya has gone digital,"When thinking about the future of money, many of us now invariably have thoughts about bitcoin. Where is it going? What role might it play in our financial lives? No matter what you think about it, bitcoin is great for starting a debate on where digital money is heading.  Africa is a place where bitcoin has major potential. But what you might not realize is how important electronic money already is to countries there such as Kenya. First, a little economic information about this East African nation. Kenya is one of the region’s largest economies with a GDP of $41 billion dollars. Fifty percent of its people live below the poverty line. Approximately 75 percent of people work in agriculture. According to the CIA World Factbook, on Kenyahttps://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ke.html, “low infrastructure investment threatens Kenya's long-term position as the largest East African economy.”  Digital money and Kenya  Kenya is clearly a place where the concept of physical money started going out of style years ago – and it likely has something to do with the lack of infrastructure investments that come from the banking industry. In Kenya, the major mobile operator, Safaricom, introduced a digital payments system called M-PESA back in 2007. The “M” stands for mobile, while “Pesa” is Swahili for money. According to the official website, by 2012 M-PESA had over 14 million active users.  Safaricom, which has a 70% mobile market share in Kenya, lets its customers send and receive money using M-PESA. All customers need to have is a mobile phone and valid identification to get started. The system uses SMS to allow users to send, receive as well as pay bills with the platform. According to Business Daily Africa, Vodafone owns the payment service, while Safaricom licenses it from them.  Not just payments  While M-PESA is very successful as a payment platform, it is now becoming a system for other financial services in Kenya. Users can opt for things like savings accounts and can even apply for loans with M-PESA. This is because in 2012 Safaricom developed a deeper financial services platform called M-Shwari. A partnership between the Commercial Bank of Africa and Safaricom, M-Shwari allows users to open savings accounts and obtain microloans at very favorable rates.  As a result, Kenyans don’t have to go to a bank, and often microloans are granted in real-time. With everything being done with a mobile phone, the service has developed into a platform for saving, with a 1% interest rate granted on accounts. According to recent figures, 1.6 million people are using M-Shwari, with savings accounts by far being the most popular service.    Source: Safaricom    When banks tried to compete…  Kenyans have taken to M-PESA because traditional banking has not worked for them. Instead of Kenyans going to banks, Safaricom decided to let banks come to Kenyans in the form of a mobile phone. In fact, M-PESA has been able to thrive even though it has had detractors within the country.  The banking industry in Kenya was so concerned about M-PESA it tried to develop its own system. In the end, though, the industry had to start working with Safaricom since network effects have made M-PESA a powerful system of payments relatively quickly. In essence, since so many in Kenya were already using M-PESA, there was really no turning back on its ease of use to go with its sheer number of users.  Monetary inefficiencies  One very good reason for bitcoin is the relative inefficiency of cash money. It is a system that we have used for a long time, since the time that society decided that the bartering system was inefficient. Today we are dealing too much in the physical handling of cash: it is expensive for money to be transported, secured and maintained.  Kenyans have realized this, and many there have decided using the country's paper currency, known as the schilling, is inefficient for so many reasons. And when you think about it, they’re probably right: it is expensive for banks to handle, which in turn also costs us money to deal with. Since most of us are already using cards to transact everything, what’s stopping many of us from going completely electronic?  What about bitcoin?  Bitcoin could have the same network effects as M-PESA has had if a successful mobile payment platform around it were developed. We’re seeing some of that happening in the developer-friendly Android ecosystem. But for the time being, it might have to come from more open platforms for feature phones like the one provided by Kipochi.  M-PESA has been able to use its network of customers to obtain clout with local banks and signing deals with the likes of Western Union to send money to places all over the world. Now, Western Union isn’t scrambing to get bitcoin customers signed up, but the M-PESA example is a sign that all it takes is user adoption for big financial companies to get on board with digital platfoms.  All about access  It almost seems as if M-PESA was something that was necessary in a country like Kenya to make the usage of money easier for people who did not have access to banking services. In the developed world, there are money inefficiencies, but they aren’t faulty enough to spark massive financial change.  There are places where this is not the case. M-PESA proves that if you give people access they will take advantage. And with the rise of smartphones, especially with adoption of Android in Kenya (see chart), people there will have even more options, where perhaps bitcoin or another decentralized currency will be a choice.    Source: Statcounter    Even Bill Gates has been impressed. Back in January, he tweeted “Kenya’s M-PESA proves that when people are empowered, they will use digital tech to innovate on their own behalf“.  What do you think about M-PESA?

42425008,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHlADh,1373459079,Bitcoin ASIC builder Terrahash changes refund policy and refuses customer,"Terrahash, one of several ASIC mining rig builders, has changed its refund policy. The company's FAQ has recently been updated to say that all orders are final. It does, however, say that customers can request a refund prior to shipping, and such requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis.  Terrahash is selling mining rigs based on Avalon ASICs, which puts it at the mercy of the Avalon supply chain. Unfortunately, claims were made against Avalon that it was mining with customer ASICs.  Terrahash has already changed its shipping policy. The company originally announced its DX Large model, stating that it would not take payment until it was ready to ship product. However, in June it changed that policy by accepting pre-orders.  According to a CoinDesk reader, he/she has been refused a refund in the following email:  All the products are made on order. We are unable to process your refund at this time, as we have already invested your money into sourcing the components and other equipment. Your products would [sic] be delivered within the promised time-frame.  However, Terrahash's FAQ page states:    Q. Do you issue refunds?      A. (Updated) All orders are final. However, you can request a refund before your order is shipped. We will process each refund request on a case-by-case basis.    The American Federal Trade Comission states the following advice to merchants:    You must cancel an order and provide a prompt refund when:        the customer exercises any option to cancel before you ship the merchandise;  the customer does not respond to your first notice of a definite revised shipment date of 30 days or less and you have not shipped the merchandise or received the customer’s consent to a further delay by the definite revised shipment date;  the customer does not respond to your notice of a definite revised shipment date of more than 30 days (or your notice that you are unable to provide a definite revised shipment date) and you have not shipped the merchandise within 30 days of the original shipment date;  the customer consents to a definite delay and you have not shipped or obtained the customer’s consent to any additional delay by the shipment time the customer consented to;  you have not shipped or provided the required delay or renewed option notices on time; or  you determine that you will never be able to ship the merchandise.    This is not unusual in the ASIC mining market. Butterfly Labs has also fallen short on shipping dates and specifications. As an alternative to refunds, a user of the bitcoin forum has taken to selling his/her pre-order for Terrahash mining rigs. The seller in question must have attempted to get a refund given the following information in the seller's FAQ.    Can I get a refund after buying? What if TerraHash issues a refund?      All sales are final. If TerraHash refunds all or any part of an order, I will pass through the amount of the refund to the buyer. The remaining portion of the price will be considered earned as a service fee for reserving the pre-order.    If you have tried to get a refund from Terrahash, successfully or not, let us know in the comments.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | MINING | TRADING,David Gilson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/07/10/bitcoin-asic-builder-terrahash-changes-refund-policy-and-refuses-customer,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1b607a8c093db73ac1c2f3b60d6d13e009a29cc3-490x297.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425022,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHlAZh,1373447810,New currency Primecoin searches for prime numbers as proof of work,"A new digital currency has been announced, which uses prime numbers as its proof of work. Primecoin is still in beta, but its goal is to provide a proof of concept that a digital currency can produce something useful besides its subjective market value.  One of the criticisms always put against bitcoin is that the cryptographic computation that provides proof of work has no intrinsic value. This is true – the bitcoin market places a subjective value on the currency, just as any other commodity. However, at least physical coins can be melted down and used to make something else.  Long before cryptocurrencies existed there were other distributed computing projects not run for profit but for scientific progress. Those projects are still running; SETI@Home was set up to help process signals from interstellar space in the hope of finding signs of alien intelligence. Meanwhile, Folding@home sought help from the public in simulating how proteins behave in order to aid research into Alzheimer's, Huntington's, Parkinson's and many types of cancer.  These projects have not gained the same notoriety as digital currencies because, to be blunt, most people are motivated by money rather than the common good. However, there have been repeated suggestions on the Bitcoin forum that digital currencies should contribute computing power to a worthwhile cause. The problem is that the SHA256 algorithms that bitcoin uses are far faster to verify than the computations done with those scientific projects. Speed of verification is crucial to protecting against double spending.  That is where Primecoin comes in. Prime numbers are a valuable mathematical resource. Prime numbers are numbers that are only divisible by one or themselves, and no other numbers. This is useful in encrypting internet traffic (e.g. SSL or TLS), because while it's easy to multiply two prime numbers together, to create a ""public key"", it's difficult to run the calculation in reverse. I.e. It's a difficult computation to take an exceptionally large number and find its ""prime factors"".  Furthermore, while prime numbers have fascinated mathematicians for centuries nobody yet understands how to calculate prime numbers. Instead, we use super computers to find prime numbers by trial and error. They take ever increasingly large numbers and attempt to find their integer (whole number) factors. If there is none (besides one and itself), then it's a prime number.  That has made prime numbers a highly valuable mathematical resource because of the way they can be used as encryption keys. So much so, that the Electronic Frontier Foundation offers cash prizes to groups that find large prime numbers. For example, in 2009 it paid $100,000 for the discovery of a 12-million digit prime.  The group behind the peer-to-peer cryptocurrency, PPCoin, think it has the answer with Primecoin. There is a detailed paper [PDF] on the website, explaining how the currency works. It shows that the proof of work in finding prime numbers is computationally efficient. However, this is on the proviso that the prime numbers are not ""record-breakingly large"".  This is where there is a question mark over the value as it isn't made clear whether there are still prime numbers, other than those that break the records, to be discovered.",NEUTRAL,없음,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | RESEARCH,David Gilson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/07/10/new-currency-primecoin-searches-for-prime-numbers-as-proof-of-work,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a37f7b3ca13bb873f9aaa52eccab8ec1f95eafc8-500x357.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
