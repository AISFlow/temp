30057545,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=626704,1719531049,"Crypto Analyst Says ‘XRP Is In Trouble,’ Here’s Why","Crypto analyst Alessio Rastani has warned that XRP is in “trouble” following his recent analysis of the chart. He outlined certain “strong warnings” on the chart, which showed that the crypto token could experience further price declines. Why XRP Is In Trouble Rastani mentioned in a video on his YouTube channel that XRP could drop to $0.13 or even lower as part of Wave C of his analysis using the Elliot Wave Theory. He noted that a drop to that price level represents about a 100% decline for XRP from Wave B and a similar corrective move to Wave A that occurred in 2020. Related Reading: Bitwise CIO Expects $15 Billion To Flow Into Spot Ethereum ETFs, How Will ETH React? The crypto analyst also alluded to the the altcoin’s bounce in 2020, around the time the crypto token was declared a non-security. He claimed that the rally then overlapped, which suggested it was a corrective bounce. He noted that these corrective rallies are bearish in nature as they usually resolve to the downside. Rastani claimed that an impulsive rally is required for XRP to continue its uptrend. That is why he believes that XRP can still drop lower since the corrective rally from 2022 is still in play. The analyst also highlighted the support levels at $0.41 and $0.35 as crucial, stating that a break below those levels will serve as confirmation for the downward move to $0.2 and $0.17. He added that XRP could even drop lower to $0.13. Meanwhile, Rastani predicts that this move could take several months, stating that the crypto token could drop to these levels by year-end or sometime in 2025. He also said that the altcoin needs to stay below the resistance levels at $0.64 and $0.74, as a break above those levels will invalidate his projections. Rastani also highlighted the momentum indicator on XRP’s chart, noting that there has been a lot of “downward negative momentum” for XRP recently, suggesting that a downward move will likely occur. He claimed that the downward momentum hasn’t been triggered yet, but he believes that it will soon happen, especially if the altcoin breaks below $0.35. An Alternative Move For Price Rastani also outlined an alternative move that XRP could make if his projections are invalidated, although he doubts that will happen. He claimed that if XRP manages to break above $0.64 and $0.74, that would mean that the rally in 2022 was Wave A, and the recent drop to around $0.40 was Wave B, thereby setting up XRP for a move to around $1.40 for Wave C. Related Reading: Dogecoin Sees Rapid Accumulation Amid Price Crash, Whale Transactions Soar The crypto analyst added that XRP could also retest the 2021 highs at around $2. However, he claimed that would mean that the next move is still downward, suggesting that the alternative move isn’t still bullish for XRP. He once again reaffirmed that the first scenario of XRP dropping to as low as $0.13 was likely to happen.

Following the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January and the anticipated launch of Ethereum ETFs in July, this development marks another milestone in expanding cryptocurrency investment options for retail and institutional investors. The news of VanEck’s Solana ETF filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) caused a surge in the native token SOL, with its price rising nearly 8% upon disclosure by Matthew Sigel, VanEck’s head of digital asset research. VanEck’s Confidence In Its Solana ETF Filing In a social media post, Sigel highlighted VanEck’s reasons behind the filing, emphasizing Solana’s potential as a competitor to Ethereum and its ability to support various applications such as payments, trading, gaming, and social interactions. Describing Solana as open-source blockchain software designed for scalability, speed, and low costs, Sigel explained that the platform offers an enhanced user experience across multiple use cases. Related Reading: Fears Of Bitcoin Sales By US And German Govts Are FUD, Even Bullish: Experts Sigel also cited Solana’s ability to process thousands of transactions per second at low fees and use a secure mechanism based on proof-of-history and proof-of-stake as reasons for the bold move to file the Solana ETF with the SEC on Thursday. VanEck believes that Solana’s high throughput, low fees, strong security, and vibrant community make it an attractive option for an ETF, providing investors with exposure to an innovative open-source ecosystem. In addition, Sigel believes that the native token SOL serves as a means of payment for transaction fees and computing services on the Solana blockchain, similar to Bitcoin and Ethereum in their respective networks, suggesting that it should be classified as a commodity rather than a crypto security, thus having a strong argument for SEC approval of the Solana ETF. Analysts Anticipate Bullish Sentiment While the news of a Solana ETF filing has generated excitement, some experts express caution. For instance, Bloomberg ETF expert James Seyffart suggests that the Solana ETF might only launch in 2025 under a new administration in the White House and SEC as the anticipated election date in the US nears, with crypto regulation as one of the main topics in the race for the White House. In addition, market analyst Adam Cochran highlights unresolved SEC claims and Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) futures volume requirements in the US as potential challenges to ETF approval. Cochran further said: If this does get approved though, floodgates opened, we’re getting ETFs for everything and it would be a wildly bullish market for every single coin. Related Reading: Why Is The Bitcoin Price Down Today? Ultimately, the filing of a Solana ETF by VanEck sets an important precedent for the cryptocurrency market. If successful, it could pave the way for broader adoption and recognition of Solana as a valuable digital commodity, offering investors, builders, and entrepreneurs alternative opportunities. At the time of writing, SOL was trading at $147 and even reached the $150 resistance line, which would be a near-term obstacle for the token in its intentions to regain previously lost levels.

Related Reading: Dogecoin Sees Rapid Accumulation Amid Price Crash, Whale Transactions Soar The token burn carried out by the team is undoubtedly bullish for Notcoin’s ecosystem, especially if the demand for the crypto token continues to increase. Moreover, the 210 million tokens burned represent a significant supply given that Notcoin boasts a circulating supply of just over 102 billion, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Meanwhile, as highlighted by the team, NOT is now more community-driven based on how the crypto token is evenly distributed among community members. This could further boost investors’ confidence in Notcoin and its ecosystem since the team isn’t greatly armed with a large percentage of the token’s supply, which could cause the market to crash. Meanwhile, Notcoin revealed that $4.2 million worth of Notcoin will be awarded as an incentive for Gold and Platinum users of Notcoin Explore. The ‘Explore’ initiative lets users earn NOT and other bonuses from projects by completing various tasks. Crypto projects can add Notcoins to the Explore pool and create a campaign involving users completing multiple tasks. On the one hand, this is an excellent way for teams to promote their projects since NOT boasts an active player base of 40 million users. On the other hand, this initiative is another bullish fundamental for the crypto token’s ecosystem as it could help increase the demand for Notcoin and ultimately drive up its value. NOT Also Bullish From A Technical Analysis Perspective Several crypto analysts have also analysed Notcoin, presenting a bullish outlook for the crypto token. Crypto analyst Captain Faibik recently mentioned that Notcoin is on the verge of a “massive wedge upside breakout.” From the chart he shared, Notcoin could rise to as high as $0.03 when it successfully breaks out from its current price levels. Related Reading: Bitcoin Crash Not Done: CoinShares Analyst Predicts ‘True Correction’ Amid Outflows Crypto analyst Planfomo also shared a similar sentient. He stated he is getting more confirmation that the bullish falling wedge pattern on Notcoin’s chart could play out. His chart showed that Notcoin could eventually rise to as high as 0.038 when this breakout finally occurs. This will represent a new all-time high (ATH) for Notcoin, with its current ATH at $0.028.

Analysts Predict $25 Target,"Chainlink (LINK) , the oracle network powering the decentralized world, has been stirring up excitement after a recent surge past a critical resistance level. Analysts are now predicting a potential price explosion, with some even charting a course for the moon. However, lurking beneath the bullish sentiment are shadowy movements by large investors, injecting a dose of uncertainty into the mix. Related Reading: Can Terra Classic Rise From The Ashes? Analyst Foresees 1,500% Price Increase Chainlink Escapes The Triangle, Eyes Set On The Sky After a period of decline, LINK has shown signs of life, decisively breaking above the $13 resistance level. This bullish move has sparked a wave of optimism, with many analysts predicting a sustained uptrend. Morecryptoonl, a renowned crypto analyst, identified a significant Elliott Wave pattern in LINK’s price action. According to this analysis, LINK is currently undergoing a consolidation phase within a triangle pattern. While this pattern can indicate a period of sideways movement, a breakout above a key resistance level of $14.85 could signal a significant shift in momentum. $LINK: Wave (B) in white could unfold as triangle pattern but the price, in this case, has to stay below the yellow line at $14.85. A break above this line will indicate that a larger corrective rally in yellow wave (B) is unfolding.#chainlink #LINK #altcoins pic.twitter.com/eGngNm0eEH — More Crypto Online (@Morecryptoonl) June 25, 2024 Bullish forces are further emboldened by the current Relative Strength Index (RSI) sitting at a neutral 43. This suggests that LINK is neither overbought nor oversold, leaving plenty of room for potential growth. Technical indicators aside, World of Charts is predicting a “sustained bullish trend” if LINK can definitively break free from its current consolidation pattern. Their optimistic forecast paints a picture of LINK reaching lofty heights between $22 and $25. Whales Stir The Waters: Selling Spree Or Strategic Shuffle? A recent wrinkle in the bullish narrative has been the movement of large amounts of LINK by whales, entities holding significant crypto holdings. Over 18 million LINK tokens were recently transferred to exchanges, raising concerns about potential selling pressure that could dampen the current rally. Related Reading: Solana Trading Plunges 93% In 24 Hours: Where Did The $100 Billion Go? However, some analysts caution against jumping to conclusions. They argue that such movements are not uncommon and could be part of a larger investment strategy, not necessarily a prelude to a selloff. A Bumpy Ride Ahead? While the future looks bright for LINK, investors should be prepared for a rollercoaster ride. The cryptocurrency market is notoriously volatile, and LINK is no exception. While the current technical analysis paints a bullish picture, unforeseen events or market fluctuations could quickly derail the positive momentum.

30044589,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=626703,1719509448,Dogecoin Profitability Rises To 75% As Shiba Inu Plunges To 52%,"Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have had similar price action in the past few weeks, but their respective holders have had different things to discuss. As two of the most popular meme coins, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu seem pretty similar at first glance. Particularly, their price movements in the past few weeks have left many holders disappointed amidst a wider decline among top cryptocurrencies. However, on-chain data suggests SHIB holders might be feeling the heat the most, as the number of addresses in losses has surged recently to almost half of the total addresses. Comparing Dogecoin And Shiba Inu’s Profitability Both DOGE and SHIB are currently experiencing negative price performance in the past 24 hours and seven days. However, the discrepancy between the two is the number of addresses that have slipped into losses during this price decline. According to IntoTheBlock’s profitability metric, the current decline is still not as daunting for DOGE holders. Related Reading: Triangle Formation That Sparked The 2017 XRP Rally Returns, What’s The Target? IntoTheBlock’s profitability metric follows wallets that are “in the money,” “at the money,” and “out of the money.” “In the money” tracks those making a profit at the current price, while “out the money” tracks those in losses. Comparing the two assets using this metric shows that around 75% of DOGE addresses are still in profit, in contrast to 52% of SHIB addresses. Furthermore, 48% of SHIB addresses are currently in losses, far higher than 23% of DOGE addresses in losses. Lastly, 119,380 DOGE addresses, representing 2% of the total are currently “at the money” at an average price of $0.1245. Around 7,630 SHIB addresses, representing 1% of the total addresses, are “at the money” at an average price of $0.000017. Decoding Recent Price Action At the time of writing, DOGE is trading at $0.123, down by 1.2% and 1.98% in the past 24 hours and seven days, respectively. SHIB is trading at $0.00001713, down by 2.05% in 24 hours and 7.56% in the past seven days. Interestingly, DOGE whales have taken the price decline as an opportunity to increase their holdings. On-chain data regarding DOGE balance across various exchanges suggests whales are accumulating. Related Reading: Bitcoin Crash Not Done: CoinShares Analyst Predicts ‘True Correction’ Amid Outflows Dogecoin has proven itself to be the top meme coin for holders over the long run. This is due to its larger community, its status as the king of meme coins, and a higher number of whales and devout investors waiting to increase their holdings at any given opportunity. Consequently, DOGE has always managed to perform better during intense price declines. While Shiba Inu has closely followed behind in terms of growth, the meme coin is still yet to gain a following as huge as Dogecoin. However, the future remains bright for both meme coins.

42407939,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga8Csj,1719509084,Who Draws the Lines? The Case for Decentralized Map Making,"Billions of people rely on maps to safely and efficiently navigate our world. Maps aren't food, clothing or shelter, but they're about as close to a basic human need as you can get. As we move from destination to destination, we trust our navigation devices to chart the best course. Next to our eyes, our phones and GPS systems provide the clearest view of our world.  Naturally, we want the maps we rely on to be accurate. But do they always present the most truthful representation?  This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's new DePIN Vertical, covering the emerging industry of decentralized physical infrastructure.  No, not always. And this poses a significant issue.  Modern maps are data repositories, navigation systems and marketing devices. In their digital form, maps do much more than just offer a snapshot of the world. Our society has grown increasingly reliant on maps to source everyday information. According to Google, more than 1 billion people use Google Maps each month. Likewise, a UnitedTires study revealed that 60% of American drivers use a GPS service at least once a week. Combined with on-demand delivery, taxi services, and searches for points of interest (POI) such as restaurants, supermarkets, and charging stations, maps impact most people on a near-daily basis.  So, who decides what data gets included in a map? What information is omitted? Is our navigation taking us down the best path? Who draws the lines?  To answer these questions, we must look at leading mapmakers and their motivations for shaping our world. As maps become more prominent in our lives, these map makers hold significant influence over day-to-day decisions. However, few alternatives exist for people to access accurate map data as a public good. Hence, the case for decentralized and open-source projects to overcome the siloed and gatekept mapping ecosystem.  Modern maps: An imperfect system  Today, a select group of cartography companies are responsible for creating and maintaining the majority of mainstream digital maps.  Each map conveys a particular viewpoint shaped by its creators. Plotting points and drawing boundaries may seem straightforward, but these tasks involve numerous choices and inherent biases.  Maps can drive behavior, and creators of purpose-built maps might downplay or elevate features to create desired outcomes. For example, a restaurant may sponsor a navigation feature that shows their destination as “recommended” despite distance, star rating and so on. In this case, the map forms a pay-to-play ecosystem where businesses that “sponsor” dominate navigation and traffic, despite not necessarily being the “best” option.  Monetizing a map is not itself a malicious act, but it does carry significant consequences if the only free-to-use consumer products are primarily directed by ad spend. On the other hand, map companies must generate revenue to sustain map data collection and innovation. As a result, most public consumer maps make trade-offs between corporate suggestions and data freshness and accuracy.  On the business-to-business side, map companies rely on proprietary information to remain competitive. Therefore, free-to-access maps are rarely as dynamic, fresh, and data-rich as they could be.  Gatekeeping innovation  When it comes to publicly available map environments, most of us make do with the few free map sources at hand. These maps are generally operated by large entities that have long dominated internet search and discovery. While they continue to update maps and roll out new features, their priorities and motivations aren’t always aligned with the public's interests.  A recent X post by a former Senior UX Researcher for Google Maps, Kasey Klimes, highlighted this issue. Klimes explains the internal rationale behind Google Maps not including “scenic” or “safe” navigation options. The thread, which has since amassed millions of views, is filled with critics questioning the company's motivations for omitting these highly requested features.  Corrupted sources  The decisions made by cartographers reflect their understanding and the data they have. Most maps today are not a singular perspective but rather a patchwork of data from ""trusted sources."" While map companies can cross-reference sources to improve accuracy, it's an imperfect system.  Despite their best efforts, mapping companies have faced significant challenges in verifying the truth and accuracy of their data. Geographic disputes, censorship, accidental additions/omissions, and bad actors seeking financial or political gain all present opportunities for data corruption.  For example:  In 2019, Google Maps faced a major issue when the Wall Street Journal discovered millions of false business addresses misleading the algorithm that suggests local service providers.  The Chinese Ministry of Natural Resources caused international outrage when their ""standard map"" expanded the country's borders into contested areas, prompting objections from the Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam, Taiwan, and India.  Baidu and Alibaba's digital maps recently came under fire for failing to correctly demarcate Israel as a country.  In 2019, the U.S. military warned of an increased risk of deep fake satellite images and location spoofing used to create tactical advantages in conflict zones.  In 2016, Google began broadcasting ""Government Requests,"" revealing thousands of censorship petitions in just six months.  The long-held practice of including trap streets (invented or distorted map features to prevent plagiarism) has led to several accidental map misprints over the years.  We'd like to believe that most map companies would never intentionally mislead the public, but it's naive to think that external sources and authorities might not exert control over map entities. Mark Monmonier said it best in his book How to Lie with Maps: ""Because most map users willingly tolerate white lies on maps, it's not difficult for maps to also tell more serious lies.""  Blindly trusting a single source of information is a recipe for disaster. As technology creates more sophisticated ways for compromised data sets to infiltrate map providers, companies are looking for better, more efficient ways to verify information at scale.  OpenStreetMap: A step towards openness  In 2004, OpenStreetMap (OSM) proposed the first major open-source solution to the map-making bias problem. It relied on the collective intelligence of global volunteers plotting geospatial data for anyone to use and reference.  OSM has been a significant step in the right direction for mapping. Hivemapper and almost every other cartography agency enthusiastically support and use the OSM database to create mapping foundations. As an open initiative, OSM doesn't house any overt bias and allows the entire network to determine what is true and accurate.  However, it is not without its issues. Lacking direct incentives or remuneration for independent contributors, the OSM platform today runs mostly on old or donated imagery from major corporations. While the system remains open for edits, buffering against blatant corruption of geospatial data, OSM still struggles to keep pace with modern cartography efforts.  Read more: Daniel Andrade - DePIN Is the Sharing Economy 2.0  Many errors and biases slip through the cracks, burdening map makers with a constant game of whack-a-mole. Although the solution is more immune to singular manipulation, it is not completely impervious. Cartographic data warfare remains an issue, and independent users can periodically corrupt map information, as seen with the mysterious user editing OSM in China’s favor.  In a perfect world, who would draw the lines? We would — all of us. Not just a select group of cartographers. If given equal opportunity to access fresh and accurate data, we’d throw off the shackles of siloed and gatekept mapping ecosystems and create a complete, fresh, and infinitely customizable map experience.  It all amounts to data.  Eliminating middlemen  We have the model for openness from OSM, but it doesn’t overcome the issues of collecting and vetting unbiased data while maintaining a network of valid sources. Unfortunately, human intermediaries are fallible. Middlemen corrupt sources, keep fresh data behind lock and key, and inject maps with their own biases.  But what if the “human” element was minimized? What if we could create a self-regulating map network that only presented honest information? With blockchain technology, this type of map network is no longer a pipe dream.  If we provide everyone with equal access to map data, we disrupt the monopolies that currently dominate the mapping world.  In simple terms, a blockchain is a ledger that accurately tracks contributions to a network. Similarly, cryptocurrencies use smart contracts to automate incentives within that network, proportionally rewarding contributions. These contributions can also extend to primary source hardware, such as dashcams.  Projects like Hivemapper have leveraged blockchain-based rewards to recruit large networks of map data contributors. However, these map contributors do not act as middlemen, nor do they exert bias within the network. Contributions are automated through purpose-built hardware and AI software, programmed to collect raw objective map data.  In Hivemapper’s case, contributions are attached to dashcams that capture and vet street-level imagery, and reward camera owners with cryptocurrency. Outside of the initial installation of the camera, human elements are minimized. Instead, the high-definition imagery captured by the dashcams does the heavy lifting of identifying and plotting map features.  Thousands of people drive on roads every day, the very roads we aim to map and analyze. So, naturally, we have map-ready fleets at our disposal. By supplying purpose-built dashcams that double as map-making machines, Hivemapper is able to automate map data collection at a global scale.  Read more: Sean Carey - Every DePIN Has a Story  It's an unbiased system that cross-validates imagery from multiple drivers and gamifies participation with regional incentives. By minimizing the human element, trust is no longer a factor but rather a variable within the network that is constantly weighed. Any bad actors looking to inject false data into the network are easily identified as other drivers retrace mapped roads and confirm or reject preceding map contributors. Those contributors that provide high-quality data to the network maintain regular rewards. Those that taint the data pool are removed from the network and omitted from the reward cycle.  Customizing the experience  Yes, people will warp and shape data to meet their desired outcomes. That isn’t something we can change outright. But if we provide everyone with equal access to fresh, accurate, and affordable map data, we disrupt the monopolies that currently dominate the mapping world.  Certain map components are objective, dependent on factual truths. Things like street names, road conditions, and sign locations are rarely the subject of debate. Starting with basic geospatial data, we can create an honest foundation for maps.  From there, users can layer on additional data for navigation, points-of-interest, business needs, etc. Through a decentralized network, we can automate elements of map freshness and, with open APIs, developers can continually innovate and create dynamic filters. Then, the public can access open marketplaces of maps and self-determine which maps best fit their needs.

42407926,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga8CF3,1719505601,U.K.'s Next Government Must Act Fast to Regulate (and Retain) Crypto Firms,"The U.K. election is July 4, and polls indicate a new Labour government is inevitable. The crypto ecosystem in the U.K. has grown steadily under various, almost exclusively Conservative, governments since the birth of Bitcoin 15 years ago. So what does this change in leadership spell for the future of crypto?  Laura Navaratnam is the U.K. policy lead for the Crypto Council for Innovation. The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk Inc. or its owners and affiliates.  Prior to the election announcement, the industry had grown accustomed to a government that, as of late, generally understood and supported crypto. In 2022, John Glen, the Economic Secretary to the Treasury (also known as the City Minister) pledged to make the U.K. a global hub for crypto-asset technologies. This vow was repeated by his successors Andrew Griffith in 2023 and, most recently, Bim Afolami, who has urged regulators to take care in policing the crypto industry to make sure its success isn’t “undermined.” Broad powers were introduced in the Financial Services and Markets Bill bringing stablecoins within the regulatory purview of the Financial Conduct Authority, and clarity on the treatment of staking was promised. Now, with Labour polling around 41%, we are days away from a wholesale change in 14 years of Tory leadership.  Labour published its manifesto two weeks ago. There were no references to digital assets or anything adjacent. More surprisingly, there was no reference to financial services entirely. We can only assume Labour has not developed a position on crypto and blockchain technologies – but this will need to change quickly. Fortunately, there are some areas where Labour could quickly make positive impacts without having to commit huge amounts of time or resources.  Finalize regulation on stablecoins. In order for regulators to consult on rules, the next government must lay the final legislative instrument to bring stablecoins within the regulatory perimeter. Based on previous promises that this would be done by the summer, the legislation is likely ready and waiting. The incoming Labour government needs to rely on its Treasury policy experts and pass this legislation.  Regulatory clarity on staking. Again, this is an area where the industry has been promised clarity. As staking is a fundamental activity which ensures the continued security and evolution of blockchain networks, where and how it might be captured by financial services regulation is crucial to understand and get right.  Guidance on financial promotions. The so-called FinProm rules have been effective for six months, and the territorial breadth combined with rigorous specificity is creating regulatory daisy chains across the industry, as firms with debatable relevance fall under its purview. It’s time to review the original policy intention and give the industry clarity on what is and isn’t in scope.  The digital assets ecosystem isn’t going away. Regulators globally understand that to maintain a competitive market, they must embrace Web3 and crypto assets, and introduce robust but proportionate regulatory regimes to manage the new reality.  Without swift and decisive action from the new government, the U.K. will fall from a global leader in innovation to a fast follower behind jurisdictions like the European Union and southeast Asia, where regulatory regimes are in place. Such concessions are hard, perhaps impossible, to claw back.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | REGULATION,Laura Navaratnam,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/06/27/uks-next-government-must-act-fast-to-regulate-and-retain-crypto-firms,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/80876fa8e79fdc89279152596c9d55c5d70386ee-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

30041433,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=626708,1719504031,Bitcoin Battling Bearish Headwinds: Is The Sell-Off Over?,"Bitcoin is struggling to shake off weakness, judging by its performance in the last few trading days. After the dump on June 24, the overall sentiment has been bearish, and sellers will likely double down, wiping gains posted in the last two days. As things stand, the sale of 4,000 BTC by the United States government is a dent for buyers. It comes hours after the German government dumped thousands of BTC early this week, forcing prices to lower. Bitcoin Trending At Oversold Territory One analyst is upbeat even amid this sense of unease across the crypto and Bitcoin markets. Citing formation in the RSI indicator, a tool for gauging momentum, the analyst is convinced prices could recover strongly going forward. Bitcoin is at its lowest overbought level in over 300 days at spot rates. This formation echoes a similar situation in 2023 when prices were stuck below $30,000. Once BTC swung to the oversold territory, prices rebounded strongly, breaking above $50,000 and reaching an all-time high in the coming months through March 2024. Related Reading: Solana Trading Plunges 93% In 24 Hours: Where Did The $100 Billion Go? Thus far, Bitcoin finds itself in the oversold territory after consolidating for roughly three months after peaking in March 2024. Then prices shot to as high as $73,800 before dumping sharply, reaching $56,500 by May 2024. Though prices have recovered, finding another ceiling at $72,000, the path of least resistance in the short term is bearish. Bitcoin is testing its horizontal range’s lower boundary for the fifth time since March. For bulls to take charge, prices must hold above the $56,500 and $60,000 zones for the bullish bias to remain. However, a confirmed breakdown below the range low might see BTC crater dropping to as low as $50,000-$52. Will BTC Bounce Higher? Capital Flow To Spot ETFs Another analyst also expects prices to recover, emphasizing the importance of the bull market support band. Sharing on X, the analyst said this support band has served as a reliable loading zone in the past bull cycle. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Faces Further Decline, $0.3389 Support Under Threat Its successful defense in January 2024 offers a positive precedent. With BTC at the same level, the probability of a refreshing bounce is high on the cards, providing a glimmer of hope.

The round also saw participation from Figment Capital, Folius Ventures, Robot Ventures, Big Brain Holding, Tangent and Credibly Neutral, and included angel investors such as the co-founder of Ethereum Vitalik Buterin, CEO of Consensys Joseph Lubin, creator of EigenLayer Sreeram Kannan, and Hasu of Flashbots.  The fresh round of capital will go towards building out the MegaETH protocol, with the aim of having a testnet go live in the next few months.  MegaETH calls itself a “real-time blockchain,” meaning that it focuses on the speed of processing transactions, with plans to stream “100,000 transactions per second with millisecond-level responsiveness.”  “We define a real-time blockchain to be a blockchain that can process transactions as soon as they arrive,” said Yilong Li, co-founder of MegaLabs, in an interview with CoinDesk. “Then you produce the resulting outputs at a very high frequency.”  According to a press release, MegaETH achieves its scaling in two ways: through its “heterogeneous blockchain architecture, which boosts performance by allowing network nodes with different hardware configurations to specialize on specific tasks,” as well as a “hyper-optimized EVM execution environment that pushes throughput, latency and resource efficiency to hardware limits.” An EVM execution environment is a blockchain operating system compatible with Ethereum's programming standard.  The idea of MegaETH was partly inspired by Buterin’s 2021 blog post, titled “Endgame,” where he addresses scaling Ethereum.  ""Creating hyper-scalable EVM implementations is a key prerequisite for truly scaling Ethereum,” Buterin wrote in a message about MegaETH, forwarded by a MegaLabs representative over Telegram. “I am excited to see brilliant developers taking on this challenge.""",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | SPONSORED,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/06/27/megalabs-behind-the-real-time-blockchain-raises-20m-led-by-dragonfly,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2cf1692a573ca1ba4ffb9090bf7fede6b3cb53e3-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42407935,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga8Cio,1719503090,"U.S. Supreme Court Says No More In-House Tribunals for the SEC, Other Federal Regulators","The U.S. Supreme Court ruled Thursday to strip the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of one of its key enforcement processes, deciding in a 6-3 vote that the federal agency’s use of in-house judges is a violation of the constitutional right to a jury trial.  In the past, the SEC has sometimes used an internal process presided over by administrative law judges, rather than suing in federal court, to handle civil securities fraud accusations and levy financial penalties. The SEC’s ability to handle matters internally was granted in 2010 by the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act in response to the 2008 global financial crisis.  After the Supreme Court’s decision, the SEC will be forced to once again rely solely on federal trial courts to enforce securities laws and seek financial penalties.  In addition to kneecapping the SEC’s enforcement abilities, the decision could have far-reaching implications for other federal agencies who have historically been able to handle enforcement via internal processes, including the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) which is facing a similar challenge.  “Today’s decision imposes an import and significant restriction on federal agencies’ ability to adjudicate enforcement actions internally rather than trying their cases in court. Although this case involves the SEC, many other federal agencies bring enforcement actions based on statutory standards that closely resemble fraud or other common law claims,” said Andrew Pincus, partner at international law firm Mayer Brown in an emailed statement.  “The Supreme Court’s decision indicates that all of those actions will now have to be tried before an independent federal judge and a jury—eliminating the “home court advantage” that has benefited many agencies for decades,” Pincus added.  Chief Justice John Roberts delivered the majority opinion, writing, ""A defendant facing a fraud suit has the right to be tried by a jury of his peers before a neutral adjudicator.""  ""Rather than recognize that right, the dissent would permit Congress to concentrate the roles of prosecutor, judge and jury in the hands of the Executive Branch,"" Roberts wrote. ""That is the very opposite of the separation of powers that the Constitution demands.""  In a concurring opinion, Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch argued that the SEC’s authority to ""penalize citizens without a jury, without an independent judge, and under procedures foreign to our courts"" are a violation of individual liberty.  ""In reaffirming all this today, the Court hardly leaves the SEC without ample powers and recourse,"" Gorsuch wrote.  Some crypto cases have been among those resolved by the SEC via administrative proceedings, including its 2018 case against Michigan-based ""ICO Superstore"" TokenLot LLC and its two owners, and its 2014 case against a computer programmer who created a crypto-denominated virtual stock exchange.  Associate Judge Sonia Sotomayor wrote the dissenting opinion, calling the ruling a ""power grab"" and ""part of a disconcerting trend: when it comes to the separation of powers, this Court tells the American public and its coordinate branches that it knows best.""  ""The Court tells Congress how best to structure agencies, vindicate harms to the public at large, and even provide for the enforcement of rights created for the Government,"" Sotomayor wrote. ""There are good reasons for Congress to set up a scheme like the SEC’s. It may yield important benefits over jury trials in federal court, such as greater efficiency and expertise, transparency and reasoned decisionmaking, as well as uniformity, predictability, and greater political accountability.""  The case, SEC vs. Jarksey, began in 2013 when the SEC alleged that hedge fund manager George Jarkesy Jr. and his firm, Patriot28 LLC, violated federal securities laws by misstating his two hedge fund’s assets.  Instead of suing Jarkesy in federal court, the case was originally tried before an administrative law judge. Jarksey appealed, and in 2022 a New Orleans-based appeals court ruled that the SEC’s proceedings were unconstitutional. The SEC appealed, and the Supreme Court heard arguments last November.

42407937,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga8Cm7,1719502325,The Prize for Owning Web3 Distribution Is Enormous. Here’s Why It Won’t Go to Big Tech,"For more than a decade, the blockchain industry has struggled with a self-determining question: how do we go mainstream? The quest for the killer app or company that suddenly moves the masses to cryptographic infrastructure has proven to be a daunting task. But unlocking product-market fit here represents more than a win for the consumer: it will signal a profound shift in how the internet is structured and governed for our lifetime. So who will be the powerhouse distributor of Web3, controlling the wallets and app store of the future?  The prize for owning Web3 distribution is enormous but increasingly out of reach for the FAANGs. Despite their vast resources and influence, to date these giants have been most successful in a supporting role, passively assisting the transition to a decentralized future by, for example, granting convenient access to compute.  Turning on Web3 is a multifaceted challenge and one not well suited for companies that prey on data and advertising to post big profits. The “world’s most innovative companies” are too entrenched in the mud of legacy business models, partners and products, slowed further by their own culture shock and shareholder short termism.  It's clear Big Tech doesn’t take crypto seriously. They’ve never been public about how their open-source initiatives might be redirected to crypto, nor bought a meaningful piece of a base layer by acquiring a token, despite the associated governance rights that could come with it to influence the roadmap. One might ask what we’ve come to expect from these legacy platform companies who unofficially govern the global web, and the true value they provide to users versus themselves.  Despite having ubiquitous distribution and seemingly unlimited opportunity to hire emerging talent in blockchain, the story has always been that it is not a big enough addressable market opportunity today. After sunsetting Libra due to regulatory backlash, Facebook’s metaverse unit has a net loss of $40bn over the past three years and still doesn't have chips on the table in crypto. Instead of leaning into being a distributor for Web3 users, they’re trying to innovate the product suite in order to continue generating more than 95% of revenue through ad sales, in part because of a pervasive belief from regulators that consumers can’t be trusted with the responsibility of their finances or their own data.  We are becoming accustomed to having our email screened to help “tune the AI model,” and, subconsciously, most consumers have acquiesced to giving up privacy in exchange for modern conveniences. This further entrenches the FAANGs’ reach and power but doesn’t bring us any closer to implementing truly modern technology like blockchain that would materially improve the average person’s life.  Giving away more and more of ourselves and our businesses’ IP to these institutions will become a requirement as the arms race for AI reinforces data-focused differentiation. This might be the moment that tilts the power structure into full greed mode, breaking entirely.  By design, the next era of the web will not be controlled by a handful of monoliths who refuse to accept a powerful but light-touch role to service end-users without overreaching. The new internet requires fresh leadership that is willing to plot a very long term course: a new generation of decentralized projects and startups built on principles of user control and community governance, who will help the industry adapt to the ethos of Web3.  Today’s builders are relentless in their pursuit of regaining power to defy exploitative Web 2.0 practices, operating systems and app store constraints, so that 10 years from now, decentralized organizations are the new more benevolent leading class and the FAANGs become service providers.  The existential threat to blockchain is that without a well organized and a strategic global marketing strategy, we will build it and no one will come. However, if we enlist a distribution partner who brings enough scale to make it lucrative to build Web3 apps, developers will start testing fun things that may unlock a big enough prize to justify the risks of building for an app store that doesn’t yet exist. Developing one “killer app” matters less than being the distributor who unlocks the opportunity for developers to acquire lots of potential users.  Telegram's fast growth  One well-poised incumbent is Telegram.  Building a base layer blockchain and associated community is a formidable task and so far very few have been successful in tapping into true consumer activity outside of cryptonatives. Every kingmaker seems to align with a new blockchain: Coinbase created BASE, FTX knighted Solana, Facebook attempted Libra, Amazon envisioned its own chain for NFTs, and so on. The scalability of new-age base layers is impressive, but it won’t be enough to win on technology alone. Distribution and activity are the scaling solution; infrastructure is becoming easier to build and could trend toward commoditizing.  The revolving door will jam when developers start sniffing out low customer acquisition cost and a huge prize in global adoption: the Telegram mini-app opportunity. Telegram Mini-Apps are an open platform for new and emerging brands to deploy crypto-friendly games and apps. The platform supports seamless authorization and crypto and fiat payments, and empowers projects to incubate, fundraise and market themselves all within the familiarity of Telegram UI. Today, The Open Network’s (TON) strategic ties with the messaging app Telegram combines both the technical capabilities to tackle web3 and the distribution power of a top-10 mobile application, and crucially, the credibly neutral geographical launchpad for a consumer-focused approach to Web3. TON already boasts Web3 primitives such as a wallet, active DeFi ecosystem and tokens with a scaled web2 user container and 900M MAUs.  Telegram’s strategic pivot allows its app developers to align their revenue models with the long-term growth of the Web3 ecosystem. By providing critical distribution, a wallet, infrastructure and support services, they can continue to generate substantial revenue while contributing to the broader goal of a decentralized internet. This symbiotic relationship benefits both the TON blockchain and Telegram, creating a more sustainable and inclusive digital economy. Telegram has always been on the fringe of Big Tech, successfully scaling a user-focused messaging app amidst heavy competition and following an unorthodox playbook: no advertising or hardware moat, just a great tech and user experience. Their mission-driven focus is akin to being religious about the user-centric approach to the new internet – aligning perfectly with Web3’s consumer and developer-led revolution.  And while the U.S. is core to the growth trajectory for most of today’s top-10 apps, for otherwise global crypto adoption, perhaps American MAUs are a “nice to have.” Strategically, Telegram go-to-market excludes the U.S. but includes the unbanked which is over four times the size of the U.S. population. While it would be great to frame this as a socially-conscious decision and it may be, it also excludes the U.S. out of necessity due to the lack of regulatory clarity and 2020 SEC lawsuit. And the proven upside outside our borders is massive: see the mini-program economy of Wechat which has grown to 5 million mini-programs since launching in 2017, achieving $400bn of annual transaction volume via the apps by 2021.  In response, Telegram has supercharged the intersection of basic financial services and a gaming economy. As the first platform to showcase a glimmer of greatness at the application level, it is finally awakening the Eastern Web3 developer community. Lately, it’s been impossible to miss the frenzy around Notcoin (35M users,) $TON entering the top 10 of all crypto tokens and the TVL surging to a new all time high through STON.fi. And if the super-app use case isn’t compelling outright, the ability to supercharge it with Web3 will be a challenge for both X and Wechat due to geopolitical pressures and the risk to their legacy businesses. As recently as this week, X rolled out a new payments platform that does not accept crypto. The company had acquired a transmitter license for crypto payments last year. Despite his personal advocacy for blockchain, Elon Musk’s ambitions and hurdles with X illustrate the complexity and regulatory challenges inherent in adopting decentralized technologies within a centralized platform.  The TON ecosystem is the closest we’ve come to mainstream adoption. If successful, it may lead to more large companies like Telegram helping crypto apps converge with the mass market. If the benefits of blockchain are clear in the user value proposition no one should think about whether a service is running on a blockchain or in the cloud.  As the Web3 revolution unfolds, it is clear that the race for control is not just about technology but about a fundamental reimagining of power, control, and trust in the digital age. Distribution is up for grabs in crypto because web3 is fundamentally at odds with the business and ethos of Web 2.0.  Eliminating irrevocable data ownership, losing 30% App Store fees and the ability to train AI on your data, and emphasizing portable identity and consumer-centric developer goals and other general side effects of de-platforming, would drive a stake through the heart of Big Tech. It will be fascinating to see Telegram’s role as a distributor and believer unfold while the rest of Big Tech tackles questions of mission and purpose and decides whether to join the party in service to the future’s protocols.

42407929,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga8COy,1719502255,DePIN Is the Sharing Economy 2.0,"I was climbing rooftops and installing antennas long before “DePIN” was a word. So you will understand my conviction in this space and forgive my unfaltering faith in its success.  Let me start from the beginning.  This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's new DePIN Vertical, covering the emerging industry of decentralized physical infrastructure.  As the co-founder of Hotspotty and depinhub.io, I have been deeply embedded in DePIN well before it had a name. From my perspective, DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks) is not merely an incremental innovation, but a fundamental shift towards a new economic paradigm: the Sharing Economy 2.0.  We can debate this, but in my view, DePIN is at least as transformative, if not more, than decentralized finance (DeFi).  The crypto revolution has highlighted the inefficiencies in centralized and intermediated financial services. Intuitively, anyone can understand that similar inefficiencies exist in non-financial centralized infrastructure, like telecommunication networks or energy grids. In our increasingly interconnected world, the limitations of traditional centralized infrastructure, marked by inefficiencies, high costs and vulnerability to failures have become ever more evident.  DePIN tackles these issues by decentralizing the deployment and management of physical infrastructure. There's no reason why the promise of crypto — to democratize access, catalyze innovation, and ensure transparency, security, and efficiency through blockchain technology and smart contracts — shouldn't extend to non-financial infrastructure. DePIN proves that point.  Imagine a world where anyone can contribute to and benefit from decentralized networks of solar panels, communication towers or electric vehicle charging stations  Imagine a world where anyone can contribute to and benefit from decentralized networks of solar panels, communication towers or electric vehicle charging stations. This model reduces dependency on large corporations, cuts costs and enhances system resilience.  The story of a project called Helium, which now boasts almost 1 million wireless hotspots, can demonstrate the power of this ecosystem. Known as the ""father"" of DePIN, Helium achieved the fastest infrastructure deployment in history. They successfully bootstrapped a decentralized wireless network globally using minimal capital and operational expenditure. By leveraging blockchain technology and offering rewards to participants, Helium created a robust, scalable and efficient network. This success illustrates how decentralized incentives can drive rapid network growth and adoption, providing a blueprint for future DePIN projects.  DePIN could also drive the next wave of the sharing economy. Unlike platforms such as Uber and Airbnb, DePIN's Sharing Economy 2.0 is characterized by decentralized ownership and control, offering a more equitable distribution of value. Participants can earn rewards for their contributions, aligning incentives and fostering collaboration, thereby democratizing access to critical infrastructure and promoting economic inclusion.  But let’s not be naive. The DePIN path is not a walk in the park. Another word for decentralization is fragmentation. So the ecosystem’s greatest asset is also its biggest challenge.  The fragmentation and complexity of the ecosystem, with projects involving various aspects such as blockchain, hardware, and infrastructure, keeping track of all developments and opportunities can be complex. To profit from DePIN, it’s necessary to understand the use-case, the hardware, and the tokenomics of a project. This is the supply side. For the demand side to truly and sustainably take off, there's a lot of translation that we, as an industry, need to do to integrate with the real-world economy. This work is essential to onboard the next millions to Web3 and make DePIN a success story.  The good news is that DePIN is an easy conversation-starter. Most people can understand, at least conceptually, the idea of building an Airbnb for GPUs in a world when GPUs are scarcer and scarcer. This brings the supply side and the demand side on the same page quickly. The hard work is to keep them there — the dependability, the resilience, the maintenance of the decentralized networks.  DePIN represents more than just a technological advancement; it is a fundamental shift in how we build, operate and interact with physical infrastructure. Personally, I like to think that DePIN is what crypto was made for. It embodies the principles of decentralization, transparency and community-driven growth, offering a path to a more inclusive, sustainable, and resilient world. Together, we can explore and shape this exciting new frontier. LFG!

42407959,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga8JyU,1719502184,Every DePIN Has a Story,"In 1987, I sat outside the Medco Center in Springfield, Kentucky, with my grandfather, Bob Burns, a blind ex-industrial laundry worker from Boston. At 80, Bob spent many of his final days at Medco Center, seated in a folding chair and following the sun like a human sundial. One day, he showed me a remarkable watch that, with the press of a button, would speak the current time – a fascinating device for a seven-year-old. This moment marked the beginning of my curiosity of how technology could change everyday life, and the start of my journey in what is now called decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN).  This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's new DePIN Vertical, covering the emerging industry of decentralized physical infrastructure.  The charm of a DePIN project is in its origin story. For many of us, DePIN is about scratching that metaphorical itch that comes from the quirks and gaps in business and society. During my tenure at Helium, one of the significant challenges we faced was incentivizing hosts to plug in our hotspots. While it was easy to get friends and family on board, achieving widespread adoption in 2013 seemed nearly impossible. Six years later, Amir Haleem, Marc Nijdam, Andrew Thompson, and the team cracked the code by creating the Helium Blockchain. This moment marked the genesis of DePIN for me and many others. With the network rapidly growing beyond and sustaining nearly 400,000 devices, the seemingly impossible became possible.  Helium is often cited as the purest example of the power of decentralized physical infrastructure. Hardly a day goes by without hearing this sentiment. But Helium did more than create a blockchain and nifty hotspots; it pioneered a new way of thinking.  DePIN brings simplicity  Let’s face it, Web3 can be complex and challenging to grasp. One of the strengths of a DePIN is its tangible nature, which makes it easier for participants to identify and understand. Not only can the average consumer comprehend what a DePIN is, but in many cases, it also enhances the user experience for them. Consumers are therefore likely to participate at more than one level within an ecosystem.  DePIN also democratizes concepts traditionally controlled by large corporations. For example, consider a project called Wingbits, which aims to democratize the sharing of ADS-B data for tracking airplane paths. This data is valuable not only commercially but also for society. Many flight tracking projects rely on users supplying ADS-B data, yet these users typically receive no benefits. With Wingbits, users are rewarded for tracking flight data through ADS-B, for which they earn a share of the revenue through a token infrastructure with sound economics.  Differentiating DePINs  More recently, DePINs have moved beyond custom hardware. Now, DePIN projects include everyday items like phones, computers, servers and even standard hardware bought for general purposes. Because of this, we’ve decided to categorize DePIN into two types: Commodity and Bespoke. This way, we can explore and make the most of both everyday and specialized hardware in expanding the DePIN ecosystem.  Commodity DePIN is all about scalability, versatility and inclusivity. It empowers projects to use a wide range of hardware, from laptops and smartphones to specialized platforms like Raspberry Pi units. By separating infrastructure software from specific hardware requirements, Commodity DePIN allows projects to adapt easily to different environments and resource constraints. Whether in bustling cities or remote areas, Commodity DePIN thrives by utilizing everyday hardware resources, democratizing infrastructure development and promoting grassroots innovation. Another big advantage is its potential for rapid growth, as supply chains don’t hinder the onboarding of existing hardware. Examples in this category include UpRock, Natix and Silencio.  In contrast, Bespoke DePIN is all about precision and optimization. This approach involves designing and creating custom hardware to meet specific project needs. Companies like Hivemapper, GEODNET, Ambient and Dimo Network are great examples of Bespoke DePIN. They engineer hardware solutions tailored for specific tasks, such as mapping, connectivity or data processing. This customization offers unmatched performance, reliability and scalability. It also opens up new possibilities for innovation, allowing projects to push the boundaries of what’s possible in fields like IoT, telecommunications, and environmental monitoring.  There is no reason why DePINs cannot simultaneously be both commodity and bespoke. A DePIN may initially operate as a commodity network, and as it grows and gains financial stability, it can transition to offering bespoke solutions that enhance the network’s capabilities. In certain instances, bespoke devices may even prove to be more beneficial and rewarding (due to the cost and complexity of the device rewards are greater in many cases) to own than their commodity counterparts.  DePIN trends  While predicting the future is challenging, it seems a pattern for DePIN projects is beginning to take shape. The primary goal of a DePIN is the rapid adoption and deployment of innovative concepts. If you have an idea that would be expensive or complicated to implement in a mainstream business, it might be a perfect fit for the DePIN ecosystem. Moreover, if you can demonstrate a market and demand for your project, its impact can be significantly amplified.  For example, Wingbits addresses the demand for ADS-B data, creating value for those who deploy radios to capture flight broadcast information. This rationale applies to many products we use today. Businesses that rely on personal or health data are particularly ripe for disruption through DePIN projects. If you are the end product of a business concept, you should be rewarded for it.  GPU ecosystems  One of the most common trends right now from the potential investments that I have analyzed involve AI. Many folks have seen networks like Io.net and Render. Some companies want to offer GPUs as a service, seeing it as a way to achieve broader engineering goals. For instance Otoy, the company behind Render has a cloud rendering service called OctaneRender. These businesses have complex systems that need specific types of GPUs. When these GPUs aren’t busy with the company’s main tasks, they could be used for other applications or training programs. This not only makes the most efficient use of the resources but also boosts the versatility and value of the GPU setup. We call this “GPU with a purpose”, and I am personally more attracted to a foundation that supplies GPUs because they have a need to use them. The demand is inherent.  Effective AI training goes beyond just having GPUs available. It involves a range of extra services and tools (see below) needed to build strong AI models.  Ensuring data accuracy and usefulness through validation and labeling is key for effective training. AI testing helps us check the capabilities and performance of AI models and large language models (LLMs) to make sure they meet the required standards. Managing high-performance networking solutions like InfiniBand and handling distributed system failures can make offering complex distributed GPUs as a service pretty challenging. This leads to an important question: why choose a decentralized system when centralized options are available? When it comes to training complex models that need a lot of hardware power and fast network connectivity, the advantages of using distributed GPUs aren’t always obvious.  Wearable devices  When it comes to wearable devices in DePIN, I believe we’re just at the beginning of what could be explosive growth. I got really into continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) while trying to improve my fitness and weight, and I had an “aha” moment: why not democratize glucose data for millions of CGM users, for science? While this hasn’t been solved yet, devices like the Cudis ring are starting to enter the decentralized world. Let’s face it, the manufacturers of wearable devices are analyzing and profiting from this data. So, why aren’t we being rewarded for it? This is an area that we will pay close attention to over the next several years.  Wireless networks  Helium has been a significant leader in mobile offloading, but it’s not the only player making waves. In under a year, Helium Mobile has welcomed almost 100,000 subscribers, a testament to the strong demand and appeal of their services.  As we look to the future, we can anticipate a surge in distributed mobile networks integrating offload traffic from major mobile carriers and MVNO networks. This integration will pave the way for more efficient and flexible mobile connectivity solutions. Additionally, we can expect enhanced support from tech giants like Apple and Google for CBRS networks, which will further bolster the capabilities and reach of these networks.  Emerging companies are also well positioned to leverage the Helium Mobile network for their DePIN products, driving forward new applications and services that harness the power of decentralized mobile connectivity.  The landscape of mobile networks is evolving rapidly, and it’s an exciting time to witness and be part of this transformation. With continued advancements and collaborative efforts, the potential for growth and innovation is limitless.  Conclusion  The potential of DePIN is bound only by our creativity. We are still in the early stages of demonstrating the usability and viability of many DePINs. There are several challenges to address, particularly concerning personally identifiable information (PII) and the integrity of information transmitted through these networks. However, I am highly optimistic that progress is being made, and innovative approaches will lead to secure decentralized services powered by a distributed network of physical devices. This is where I will be dedicating my efforts in the coming years.  Ecosystems like Solana (which now hosts Helium), and Peaq have significantly lowered the barriers to entry for DePIN projects. It’s no longer necessary to create a new L1 or extensive infrastructure to develop a unique offering. This shift allows us to focus on solving specific problems, with the DeFi aspects becoming easier and almost secondary. This enables us to concentrate our efforts on finding effective solutions to real-world problems.

Roxanna Islam, from VettaFi, decodes the issuer's S-1 filings for these ETFs and discusses the progress made since the approvals of the spot bitcoin ETFs earlier this year.  In Ask an Expert, Eric Tomaszewski from Verde Capital Management answers common questions about the availability of Ether ETFs and why they matter to investors.  - Sarah Morton  You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  Decoding S-1s for Spot Ether ETFs  For fans of crypto, ETFs, or both, the potential launches of spot ether ETFs have added to the excitement that began earlier this year with the spot bitcoin ETF launch. As potential approvals approach, there has been discussion about certain documents like 19b-4s and S-1s and their relevance. While a lot of their content is standard for SEC filings, there are several good takeaways hidden among the legal jargon. Based off S-1s and other industry data, here is what we know so far about spot ether ETFs.  What are 19b-4 and S-1 filings?  So-called 19b-4 documents are filed by exchanges (e.g., the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ) to inform the SEC of a proposed rule change. These filings are required to list a new type of ETF. Issuers were asked to amend their 19b-4s around May 20, during which most of the issuers removed provisions for staking. The SEC approved amended versions of these from eight issuers – VanEck, 21Shares, Grayscale, Fidelity, Invesco, iShares, Franklin and Bitwise – soon afterward, on May 23. (Later, ProShares also threw their hat into the ring.) While this means that the SEC will likely approve spot ether ETFs, we are still waiting on official approval for S-1s (registration statements) before these ETFs start trading. Spot ether ETF issuers have been filing amended S-1s in response to SEC comments – often a good sign that talks are progressing. Final approval will likely be within 90 days of the initial 19b-4 approvals, which means it could be sometime this summer (and likely sooner than later).  What do S-1s tell us about spot ether ETFs?  Potential concentration in custodians. Like spot bitcoin ETFs, the majority of spot ether ETF issuers have chosen Coinbase as their custodian, which could cause concentration issues or a potential conflict of interest among competing products. Only VanEck and Fidelity have chosen custodians outside of Coinbase. (VanEck, however, expects to execute an agreement that would allow Coinbase to become an additional custodian.)  Creation/redemption baskets vary among issuers. Larger issuers like iShares, Fidelity and VanEck will issue and redeem shares in blocks of 40,000, 25,000 and 25,000 respectively. Many of the other issuers will use baskets of 10,000.  TBD on the fee war. Fees have so far been left blank (but logically, we could see fees go as low as they did for spot bitcoin ETFs).  Risk factors look intimidating but should be approached rationally. The longest section in the S-1 is risk factors (50+ pages in some of the filings). But most of these are standard disclosures—risks of volatile markets, risks related to lack of demand, and risks related to new asset classes can be found in most stocks and ETFs.  Investors need to weigh the pros and cons of ETF investment vs. direct investment. Investors may not receive some of the benefits related to spot ether ETFs. Investors would not have access to staking or to any “forked” or “airdropped” assets.  Ark drops out of the spot ether race. Despite being a vocal player in the crypto ETF world, Ark pulled its name from its spot ether filing, leaving 21Shares as the sole issuer. Ark released a statement that they will be “evaluating efficient ways to provide [their] investors with exposure to [Ethereum] in a way that unlocks its full benefits.” This might be due to the lack of staking or the fact that fee wars have made spot bitcoin ETFs unprofitable.  ProShares enters the spot ether race. Surprisingly, ProShares (who became a big name in crypto futures ETFs) did not launch a spot bitcoin ETF but was a late filer in the spot ether race. While traditional financial players like BlackRock and Fidelity may take significant market share again, ProShares may be able to take a chunk of that given its name recognition in the space.  Bottom Line:  Overall, we know more about spot ether ETFs than we did about spot bitcoin ETFs given the precedent set earlier in this year. As we look forward to potential spot ether ETF approval, we might see the pathway ahead for other crypto ETFs (i.e., Solana) become more clear.  - Roxanna Islam, Head of Sector and Industry Research, VettaFi  Ask an Expert  Q: What excites you about an Ethereum ETF?  A: The recent initial approval of the first step for an Ethereum ETF represents a significant milestone for the digital asset industry, partly because it could create easier access for the average person.  In addition, final approval could create a regulatory framework for institutional adoption, which is a market estimated to be in excess of $100 trillion globally.  Bigger picture, an ETF launch could further the legitimacy of the asset class and overall acceptance, which would ultimately encourage more attention and inflows. This would be a big win for the validation of the digital asset space and future inclusion in diversified portfolios.  Q: What are some of the risks with an Ethereum ETF?  A: There is a concern that spot ETF approvals could potentially create massive players who could significantly influence validator power over time. The same applies for counterparty, centralization and concentration risks.  Q: What are some of the risks with Ethereum on-chain?  A: I believe that the risks differentiate more broadly when you consider Ethereum on-chain being used within different ecosystems and projects. This arguably creates technological, regulatory, financial, and security risks. All that said, risk is differentiated and rewarded.  Q: What are some opportunities or reasons someone should consider Ethereum on-chain?  A: Being on-chain opens a world of possibilities, permissionless innovation and inclusive financial services.  As an example, staking allows participants to earn rewards for their participation in securing the Ethereum network, which in some ways directly embodies the ethos of the Ethereum ecosystem and the community values.  Beyond staking, there are countless ways to support projects which may result in a range of benefits that go beyond monetary reasons. Community and culture are the cornerstones of the digital world. An ETF arguably misses many of these key attributes.  - Eric Tomaszewski, Financial Advisor, Verde Capital Management  Keep Reading  Bitcoin and crypto are used for less than 0.5% of money laundering globally, according to new research..

42407955,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga8Jhx,1719499369,"Coinbase Accuses U.S. SEC, FDIC of Improperly Blocking Document Requests","Coinbase, through an intermediary, is again taking U.S. regulators to court to argue about Freedom of Information Act requests.  The U.S. crypto exchange is going after documents at the Securities and Exchange Commission that may reveal how it first began deciding what digital tokens the agency would consider as securities.  The company's contractor, History Associates, is also suing the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. over letters sent to financial firms to ask them to pause crypto activities.  A research firm Coinbase contracted is suing the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and a federal banking agency, accusing them on Thursday of failing to produce documents under open-records laws that would shed light on the regulators' views on cryptocurrencies.  On behalf of the U.S. digital assets exchange, History Associates Inc. said it's been improperly rebuffed by the SEC and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. regarding documents that Coinbase contends should be available under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). At the SEC, Coinbase is seeking written communications in three closed cases for how the agency formally worked out what digital assets it thinks qualify as securities, including Ethereum's ether {{ETH}}. And at the FDIC, the exchange wants copies of the so-called ""pause letters"" the agency's inspector general said were sent to financial firms advising that they slam the brakes on crypto activity.  Coinbase's representatives are swooping in with this legal challenge right on the heels of the SEC's indication that it's reportedly closed its review of ""Ethereum 2.0"" as a potential security, so the regulatory agency may have greater difficulty rejecting document requests based on ether being at the center of an ongoing enforcement matter.  The exchange is also seeking documents tied to two previously settled digital assets cases. One involves Zachary Coburn, who founded the EtherDelta platform that acted as a market for ether that the SEC deemed in a 2018 action to be ""digital asset securities,"" and the other focused on Enigma MPC, a blockchain startup that in 2017 sold $45 million in ENG tokens that the SEC ruled were unregistered securities.  ""We asked the SEC for documents about closed investigations to shed light on how the SEC views its newfound, sweeping (and unlawful) authority,"" Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal said in a post on X (formerly Twitter). ""One of those investigations, which only recently closed, focused on ETH, which the SEC publicly announced is not a security in 2018. And the other investigations have been closed for years. But the SEC stonewalled our requests.""  The SEC has denied requests for information on those long-closed cases and the more recent ETH matter under FOIA's ""exemption 7A"" – the protection against revealing matters that could undermine its law enforcement efforts.  Spokespeople for the SEC and FDIC declined to comment on the lawsuits.  History Associates' suit against the FDIC argues the letters asking firms to pause digital assets business ""are part of a deliberate and concerted effort by the FDIC and other financial regulators to pressure financial institutions into cutting off digital-asset firms from the banking system.""  The lawsuits join a host of other legal clashes between Coinbase and U.S. financial regulators. It's currently in a fight with the SEC over the agency's accusations that it operates an illegal exchange that trades unregistered securities is among the industry's highest profile court battles that could ultimately determine the course of crypto in the U.S. Coinbase also sued the SEC seeking a court order that would force the regulator to issue guidance defining digital asset securities.  Coinbase has funded lawsuits against U.S. government entities before. In 2022 it backed a group of investors and developers – including some of its own employees – who sued the U.S. Treasury Department over its sanctions against crypto mixer Tornado Cash. That suit was ultimately unsuccessful in a federal court, though the plaintiffs appealed.

30038415,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=626705,1719498651,Why Is The Bitcoin Price Down Today?,"The Bitcoin price is in a decline once more, after seeing some recovery on Wednesday due to the turnaround in the Spot Bitcoin ETFs net flows. However, just one day later, it seems the pioneer cryptocurrency has resumed the downtrend and this decline after the recovery has begun a worrying trend. So, what are the factors that are driving this decline? Bitcoin Price Suffers From Sell-Offs One of the major factors that have been behind the Bitcoin decline is the major sell-offs that have rocked the digital asset. These sell-offs are not just from any investor, but rather large BTC sells being orchestrated by large governments. Related Reading: Bitwise CIO Expects $15 Billion To Flow Into Spot Ethereum ETFs, How Will ETH React? One of the major news that rocked the space was the fact that the German government had begun selling coins. In total, the German government sold around 2,786 BTC, which was worth around $$140 million at the time of the sale. However, the German government is not the only one that has been selling. News also broke that the US government had begun moving Bitcoin seized from the Silk Road bust once again. On-chain data aggregator Arkham reported that the US government had moved almost 4,000 BTC from its wallets to the Coinbase exchange. In total, the US government moved 3,940 BTC to the exchange, which amounted to $241.22 million at the time of the transaction. This transfer is worrying as coins are usually moved to centralized exchanges such as Coinbase for sale as these trading platforms possess deeper liquidity compared to their decentralized counterparts. Has BTC Reached Its Bottom? While the downtrend looks to have resumed, there are signs that point to the bottom being closed. One of these signs is the return of demand into the market. For example, the Spot Bitcoin ETFs had seen seven consecutive days of outflows, which eventually turned around on Tuesday. Data from Coinglass shows that between Tuesday and Wednesday, inflows into the Spot Bitcoin ETFs have crossed $50 million, ending the brutal week of outflows. Related Reading: Triangle Formation That Sparked The 2017 XRP Rally Returns, What’s The Target? Another possible tell is the profit and loss margin for investors. This shows how many Bitcoin investors are currently seeing profit, and the higher the profitability, the higher the likelihood of a sell-off as investors take profit from their positions. However, the profitability levels have dropped, meaning that investors are less likely to sell their holdings as they wait for better prices. This often gives demand time to build up and create a possible bounce point for a recovery. For now, the Bitcoin price is holding steady at the $61,000 support at the time of writing. But if sell-offs resume, then the pioneer cryptocurrency could fall to the $60,000 level soon.

Analyst Foresees 1,500% Price Increase Marathon Makes A Move Into The Kaspaverse On Wednesday, June 26th, Marathon Digital, a behemoth in Bitcoin mining, sent ripples through the crypto market by revealing they had begun mining Kaspa. This strategic move signifies a potential diversification of their revenue stream, venturing beyond the well-trodden path of Bitcoin. Kaspa, a fellow proof-of-work cryptocurrency, boasts a unique advantage: speed. With a current value of a little over $15 million, Marathon has mined close to 94 million KAS thus far. #Kaspa has clearly broken through the 18 cent barrier and is heading for 19 cents! After that we can expect a new all-time high for $KAS!#crypto #pow $BTC pic.twitter.com/ruNt9kfeoL — KASPA Enthusiast 𐤊 (@KASPAEnthusiast) June 27, 2024 Unlike Bitcoin’s 10-minute block processing time, Kaspa leverages a BlockDAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) architecture, enabling it to churn out multiple blocks simultaneously. This translates to faster transaction processing, a potential game-changer in the ever-evolving world of digital payments. Aligning With Profitability: Kaspa’s Allure Marathon Digital’s decision to embrace Kaspa mining wasn’t solely driven by technological innovation. The company clearly sees an opportunity for increased profitability. Kaspa currently offers miners the potential for higher block rewards compared to Bitcoin. Additionally, Marathon secured a significant amount of specialized Kaspa mining hardware (ASICs) last year, estimated to generate profit margins as high as 90% under optimal conditions. Adam Swick, Marathon’s Chief Growth Officer, emphasized the strategic importance of this move: “By mining Kaspa, we’re establishing a revenue stream separate from Bitcoin, one that directly aligns with our expertise in digital asset computing.” Swick added that the organization’s existing infrastructure, strong relationships with hardware manufacturers, and a robust financial reserve positions them “perfectly to mine Kaspa and capitalize on the high margins it offers.” Is This The Dawn Of A New Era For Kaspa? The news of a Bitcoin giant entering the Kaspa arena has undoubtedly bolstered investor confidence in the cryptocurrency. The price surge reflects this newfound optimism, with Kaspa inching closer to its all-time high. However, the cryptocurrency market remains notoriously volatile. While Kaspa’s technological edge and potential for profitability are undeniable, its future trajectory hinges on various factors, including wider adoption, developer activity, and overall market sentiment.

GRIID shares tumbled more than 50% on the news, while CLSK rose nearly 4%.  The deal has been approved by both the boards and expected to be closed by third quarter.  Bitcoin mining deal-making continues to ramp up, as CleanSpark (CLSK) has agreed to buy peer GRIID Infrastructure (GRDI) in an all-stock deal valued at $155M.  The purchase will see CleanSpark assuming all debt and other obligations of GRIID and provide a $5 million loan as a pay-down bridge loan of approximately $50.9 million, according to a statement on Thursday.  ""This acquisition would give us a clear and steady path over the next three years to accomplish in Tennessee what we proudly achieved in Georgia over the past three years,"" said CleanSpark's CEO Zach Bradford. ""That achievement was to build out over 400 MW of infrastructure backed by valuable, long-term power contracts.""  Shares of GRIID slumped more than 50% following the announcement, while CleanSpark's rose nearly 4%, implying traders are likely seeing the deal as a fire sale.  The news comes as bitcoin mining mergers and acquisitions (M&A) have been heating up following the recent halving event which made the already competitive industry even more so. Recently, Riot Platforms (RIOT) and Bitfarms (BITF) have been battling it out in a hostile takeover attempt, while Core Scientific (CORZ) is also in play to be acquired by a cloud computing company.  This deal is expected to close in the third quarter, and CleanSpark anticipates exceeding 100MW capacity in Tennessee by year-end and eventually grow that to 200MW next year and more than 400MW in 2026, according to the statement.  The companies have also entered in to a hosting agreement where 20 megawatt (MW) worth of power capacity will be allocated to CleanSpark.  GRIID was founded in 2018 and listed on the Nasdaq earlier this year after several delays due to the brutal crypto winter. The miner currently has mining facilities in Watertown, New York; Limestone, Maynardville and Lenoir City, Tennessee.

CONY's strategy does not offer significant protection against downside risk but provides a small return regardless of COIN's performance. CONY's current option positioning gives it more significant appreciation potential than is typical in covered call strategies but lower returns, given no rise in COIN's value. Assuming full distribution reinvestment, CONY performs best compared to COIN immediately after periods of high volatility and poorly during bull market rallies. I expect the cryptocurrency rally will either hit a blow-off point or crash. CONY's positioning is ill-suited in either case, whereas long options may be better in current market conditions. Those who follow my work may know I am generally critical of call-option-oriented ETFs, such as those managed by YieldMax and others. This is not because these funds lack efficacy or that there is an issuer with the manager, but that investors often misunderstand the dividend income potential of this strategy. Put simply, I believe selling calls is not a viable way to produce sustainable and predictable income. Further, doing so on highly volatile stocks is likely to deliver poor risk-adjusted returns in the long term compared to owning such stocks outright. That said, selling calls can be a speculative strategy that will outperform over specific periods, making them viable for those with specific speculative or technical outlooks. However, I think they're very unsuitable as an income strategy for retired investors. The ETF ( CONY ), which focuses on covered calls on Coinbase ( COIN ), is perhaps among the more risky covered call funds I've encountered. The primary issue is that COIN is often prone to extensive and prolonged periods of positive or negative trends and is rarely in a range-bound environment that would lead to covered call outperformance. Thus, CONY is more likely to deliver lackluster returns than its underlying asset. Still, this depends significantly on the performance of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Investors may significantly underestimate CONY's risks since the cryptocurrency market has been generally strong over the past two years. Why CONY Will Usually Underperform Firstly, CONY's more accurate SEC dividend yield is 4.73% , not 83.7%, as it may seem based on its TTM distribution. A distribution and a dividend are not the same, though they are too often conflated. A distribution includes both true dividends and returns of capital. In CONY's case, its dividend comes from its Treasury bond positions, while its capital returns (making up most of its distribution) come from call option premiums. This is important not just for tax purposes but also because an option premium does not carry the same attributes as a dividend. Option premiums are positively associated with volatility, meaning CONY's distribution yield usually rises with COIN's volatility. However, option premiums are also directly proportional to share prices, so if COIN loses value, which is often the case when its volatility increases, we will eventually see a sustained decline in CONY's distribution rate as premiums decline proportionally to stock prices. I think many investors and analysts are often mixed up at this latter point. For example, in stocks and bonds, it is usually that their dividends/payments will not decline even if their price does. A large decline in a stock's price may result in a temporary (or permanent) dividend cut, but that stems from a decrease in profitability, not a direct result of lower equity prices. Further, a large increase in equity prices will not necessarily improve the distribution rate because covered call selling results in capped appreciation but unlimited downside (to zero). That said, this depends significantly on the specific strategy YieldMax decides to pursue. It is actively managed, so it can use many different option strategies to try to earn the best return. This approach makes its distribution and risks less predictable but may make CONY more adaptable to market conditions. Using a live option pricing tool, I modeled the risk-return profile of its current holdings. Today, it has a written (negative) put position at 260, expiring July 19th, and a 260 positive call position expiring the same date. Together, these options create a ""synthetic long,"" akin to a normal bullish position but with far less capital needs. It also has a written June 28th call at 222.5, which is about at-the-money, and an additional written June 28th call at 237.5, which is out of the money. Together, these provide CONY with a slight premium if COIN stays where it is and some added appreciation potential if COIN rises markedly. It is essential to consider I'm looking at this very close to the expiry date. I've modeled these positions proportional to their market value per CONY's holdings for 6/26 . From this modeling, the fund would have a ~$5M gain (~80 bps on $614M in underlying assets) given no change in COIN and a maximal gain of $43M (7% on underlying) should COIN surge by 8% in the coming days to ~$237. Thus, we see a nearly linear correlation in likely appreciation, with potentially negative exposure past that $237 mark, making this strategy far from the typical covered call. See below: 10% surge, with a nearly 1% gain given no COIN change"" contenteditable=""false""> Estimated COIN Option Payoff for CONY 6/26/24 (OptionsProfitCalculator) To be fair, I think this is a good strategy for COIN today. It provides a small but material potential return given no change in COIN's value, with nearly linear appreciation potential up to a normal probable increase in COIN and negative exposure past the point of an unlikely rise in value. The latter is the tradeoff of having the small benefit of a gain given no increase in COIN's value. Crucially, CONY can alter its strategy at any time. It will likely do so, so my modeling will not necessarily be accurate as it rolls its strategy forward once these options expire. However, I think it is fair to assume that CONY's managers are pursuing a covered-call-like strategy, altered specifically to improve appreciation potential. For a typical ""at the money"" covered call strategy, we'd expect a more significant potential gain given no change in the underlying value, offset by a lower ""cap."" This implies CONY's managers do not want the fund to underperform significantly in a bull market, as is typical of covered call strategies. Still, CONY does considerably underperform during COIN's bullish rallies. We can see this by comparing the charts below. First, see the total return (which includes reinvested distributions) and price return ratios of CONY to COIN since CONY's inception: Data by YCharts The lower chart shows how CONY will consistently depreciate compared to COIN, with slight variation over time. That is simply because option strategies require continued full distribution reinvestment to maintain their value. If investors treat CONY as ""income"" by taking these capital distributions out, they will eventually lose all of their capital investment. It may take many years and will not occur during bull markets, but it is inevitable that most typical call-selling strategies will cause capital decay toward zero simply because the downside is not capped while appreciation is. Hence, option premiums are capital returns, akin to selling a portion of your assets for cash (""taking money from the piggy bank""), but not a cash return on invested capital. Those interested in CONY as a personal income strategy should consider it more akin to a reverse mortgage because these distributions ultimately come at the expense of equity. Still, if all distributions are reinvested (total return), we can more accurately see how the overall performance of COIN and CONY differs. Theoretically, the long-term difference should not be huge if we assume the option market is fairly valued. CONY's underperformance on a total return basis can be attributable to its lower volatility, stemming from its slight protection against downside risk (from having positive premium returns even with stagnation in COIN). The total return ratio chart demonstrates that CONY underperforms COIN during its bull markets but outperforms during stagnation and consolidation. CONY's most considerable underperformance periods are in November and December 2023 and February and March of this year. This coincides with the significant increases in COIN's value, which Bitcoin and others primarily drive. See below: Data by YCharts These rallies are associated with an increase in volatility. For the most part, higher volatility equals higher potential premium returns on calls but a greater risk of loss. As such, a significant volatility spike followed by a stagnant consolidation period benefits CONY during the latter, as that will usually be where premiums are the highest compared to actual volatility. Of course, we can only see that in retrospect. It is very hard to predict where a trend will end, but if you can, selling options at such levels will usually have the best risk-reward potential. Conversely, we can see CONY underperforms during positive trends, meaning it should not benefit greatly from a ""to the moon"" event in cryptocurrencies. Further, going back to my P&L model for CONY, we can see its potential for losses in a bear market is not significantly mitigated. It is often said that covered calls have protection against downside risk. That is, to me, inaccurate, as long put options are means by which downside risk can be limited. For example, if COIN is flat for a month, we should expect CONY to earn a 1-5% added premium return. If COIN crashes, theoretically losing 50% of its value in a month (which it has historically), then CONY should lose that amount minus that 1-5% premium return, so in this case, 45-49%. Again, that is theoretical as its specific strategy could differ, but it is generally true based on its current holdings. In short, CONY's strategy does not offer protection against downside risk but a small return regardless of COIN's performance, giving a slight offset to a large decline. However, investors should understand this as a minor benefit during stagnant periods, with very slight mitigation against large declines. Realistically, if COIN crashes as it did from 2021 to 2022, CONY would see very similar losses, with perhaps a few percent in added relative performance. The Bottom Line CONY's performance is driven by COIN, which Bitcoin drives. As of May, I have a bearish outlook on COIN, as described in detail in "" Coinbase: Cryptocurrencies Moving From 'New Paradigm' To Denial (Rating Downgrade). "" It is worth noting that I had a bullish view on COIN from January of 2023 to the end of the year, taking advantage of the 300% gain over that period. I am now bearish on COIN. I think it is overvalued as a company compared to its potential earnings, and I feel that the crypto bull market is reaching its peak. I also believe Bitcoin's efficacy as a currency is greatly overestimated, although that is a long-term factor. In the short run, I would not be surprised to see Bitcoin reach $100K, which would be bullish for CONY and COIN. That said, it seems more likely that its momentum is too low for that to occur. A blow-off-top in Bitcoin would benefit it and COIN, but not necessarily for CONY because its appreciation potential is capped. Thus, I am particularly bearish on CONY today because I think it will either face significant losses from a COIN reversal crash or stagnate as COIN continues to rocket up. To me, CONY currently has a ""lose-lose"" positioning since I think it is unlikely Bitcoin or COIN will enter a prolonged range (or stagnation), which would advantage CONY. COIN's current implied volatility is 62% , which is much below its normal level. As such, it may be best to buy options (either calls or puts, depending on directional views) rather than sell them, assuming COIN is due to another volatility spike. Personally, I think a long straddle or strangle (specifically) could be best today, which is essentially the opposite of CONY's current positioning. CONY also has a higher 1% expense ratio and is not entitled to dividends from COIN. It is unlikely COIN will pay large dividends anytime soon, but that largely stems from CONY using a synthetic long position rather than a standard long position. CONY's expense ratio is higher than most but is not atypical of an actively managed fund. Still, it adds to the reasons why it is likely best to speculate on COIN or cryptocurrencies instead of CONY. Further, as explained, CONY is a terrible long-term income strategy and only has alpha-generated potential based on short-term speculative trends (such as betting on a flat cryptocurrency market).",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4701309-cony-lose-lose-positioning-as-crypto-market-appears-likely-to-soar-or-crash?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/30037811.jpeg

42407951,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga8JRQ,1719495707,EU's Restrictive Stablecoin Rules Take Effect Soon and Issuers Are Running Out of Time,"The stablecoin rules from the European Union's Markets in Crypto Assets legislation will take effect on June 30.  The rules ban stablecoins from having over 1 million daily transactions that pay for goods or services settled off- and on-chain.  Tether, Circle and other big stablecoin issuers will soon be on a tight leash in the European Union.  With new rules that take effect on June 30, not only will they require appropriate authorization to operate in the 27-nation trading bloc, they will also face the tough limits on transaction numbers and values set out in the Markets in Crypto Asset (MiCA) legislation.  The regulations mean that some of the biggest stablecoin issuers including Tether, whose dollar-pegged USDT is the world's largest by market cap, and Circle, responsible for second-ranked USDC, may not be able to operate in the EU, said Robert Kopitsch, the secretary-general of Blockchain for Europe.  ""Non-EU, euro-denominated stablecoins – if they are over a certain threshold – then you need to stop issuing and using them, and that creates a problem because 99% of the stablecoins market is in USD,"" Kopitsch said on the sidelines of CoinDesk's Consensus 2024 conference in Austin, Texas last month.  Caps  MiCA is the EU's comprehensive package of rules for the crypto industry. It was voted into law last year and allows firms licensed by one member nation to operate throughout the bloc.  According to the law's Article 23, companies must stop issuing an asset-referenced stablecoin that is used as a means of exchange for more than 1 million transactions or a value north of 200 million euros ($215 million) a day. The stablecoin rules take effect at the end of the month, and the other provisions are expected to come into force in December.  The tough rules were created to prevent stablecoins like Facebook's now abandoned project Diem (formerly known as Libra) from replacing the euro, said Mark Foster, the EU policy lead at the Crypto Council for Innovation.  The caps are there ""to safeguard the monetary system,"" a European Banking Authority (EBA) spokesperson said.  Blockchain for Europe and the Digital Euro Association – a think tank – tried to fight the measures in a 2022 letter arguing that they effectively banned large stablecoin issuers.  Read more: MiCA, EU’s Comprehensive New Crypto Regulation, Explained  A spokesperson for the EBA told CoinDesk that the provisions do not prevent companies from issuing stablecoins denominated in assets other than the euro. The key is whether they're used as a means of exchange, to pay for goods or services. If so, then the specific caps apply.  Issuers can service Europeans without limitations when the tokens aren't a means of an exchange, Jón Egilsson, co-founder at Monerium said in a statement. That includes transactions between currency areas, peer-to-peer transactions and where a cryptocurrency is exchanged for an e-money token, he said.  A final report on draft standards for stablecoin issuers published on June 19 suggests that only transactions where both the payer and payee are in the EU will be counted.  According to an earlier consultation document, a transaction includes both on-chain and off-chain transfers. Movements between addresses or accounts of the same person do not qualify as a transaction.  Companies that have had to suspend issuance will need to submit a plan showing they can keep to the limits before being reinstated. This could be tough: USDT's daily global trading volume is about $27 billion according to CoinGecko data. USDC's is $5 billion.  Another barrier is obtaining the necessary certification.  ""When you're a stablecoin issuer at European level you need to have an e-money institution license or banking license, which is a very costly, long process,"" Kopitsch said.  Circle and Tether are trying  So Tether, Circle and other issuers have just three days to secure an e-money license to operate legally.  Circle which conditionally registered as a Digital Asset Service Provider with the French Financial Markets Authority in April, aims to have an e-money license by the deadline, a spokesperson for the company said.  ""Circle is committed to full compliance with EU's MiCA regulations. We plan to onshore EURC to the EU and issue it from Circle France in a MiCA-compliant manner,"" the spokesperson said. ""Additionally, we intend to issue USDC for our EU-based customers from the same entity in accordance with MiCA and subject to regulatory approval.""  EURC is the company's euro-backed stablecoin. Tether's equivalent is EURT. Earlier this week crypto exchange Bitstamp delisted the Tether token, citing MiCA. OKX delisted USDT in March, saying it wanted to focus on euro-denominated liquidity in the region.  ""Tether has engaged extensively with its exchange counterparties in Europe regarding the requirements, including those pertaining to the ongoing listing of USDT and other Tether tokens, and the interpretation of key regulatory provision,"" said Paolo Ardoino, Tether's CEO, in a statement. ""While Tether is optimistic about MiCA's implementation, it remains crucial that stablecoin regulatory policies enacted are balanced, protect consumers, and nurture growth in our emerging industry.""  How the industry proceeds will depend on the European Commission and the incoming commissioners chosen by the newly elected European Parliament.  ""The question is what happens next because there's a growing understanding that there is a need for a solution,"" Kopitsch said regarding the stablecoin rules' restrictive nature.

42407952,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga8JbL,1719495604,Julian Assange Received $500K Bitcoin Donation From Anonymous Bitcoin Whale,"Julian Assange's wife Stella earlier this week made an ""emergency appeal"" to raise £520,000 to cover the cost of a private jet for Julian Assange to travel from the UK to Saipan and then to Australia.  One donor alone sent just over 8 bitcoin worth roughly $500,000.  The WikiLeaks co-founder reached a plea deal with the U.S. DOJ, freeing him after several years of imprisonment in the UK.  WikiLeaks co-founder Julian Assange earlier this week received a donation of 8.07 bitcoin {{BTC}} from one entity, helping to cover the cost of a private jet that flew him out of the UK and ultimately to freedom in Australia after he reached a plea deal with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ).  Initially, Assange's wife Stella made an ""emergency appeal"" to raise £520,000 to pay for the transport, setting up a crowdfunding page that allowed people to donate in fiat currency via credit cards or bank transfer. With that site notably not allowing crypto for donations, the family quickly moved to set up another page to accept bitcoin.  Up to this point, the bitcoin address has received 34 donations totaling just over $500,000. The overwhelming majority, however, came from just that one 8.07 BTC donation. The original fiat site has also received about $500,000 in donations.  ""Julian’s travel to freedom comes at a massive cost: Julian will owe USD 520,000 which he is obligated to pay back to the Australian government for charter Flight VJ199,"" Stella Assange wrote on X. ""He was not permitted to fly commercial airlines or routes to Saipan and onward to Australia. Any contribution big or small is much appreciated.""  The jet was organized by the Australian government after Assange reached a historic plea deal on Tuesday, where he pleaded guilty to espionage charges in exchange for his freedom.  Bitcoin and Assange, of course, have a long history together, with Wikileaks more than 10 years ago surviving on bitcoin after the site was cut off from traditional banking rails. In a 2014 interview Assange said that WikiLeaks and bitcoin ""kept each other alive.""",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT,Oliver Knight,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/06/27/julian-assange-received-500k-bitcoin-donation-from-anonymous-bitcoin-whale,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fc83ece0a4ad48505472fe28467434a2e628a245-1600x900.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The filing is the first solana ETF registration in the U.S.  Asset manager VanEck filed to sell shares in a Solana {{SOL}} exchange-traded fund (ETF), the first such registration in the U.S., just six days after 3iQ filed for a similar product in Canada.  The S-1 registration form lodged with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), helped lift the SOL token's 24-hour gain to almost 8%. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), a measure of the broader crypto market, has added 1.8%.  VanEck has been known to be a first mover in this space. The asset manager was the first to file for a spot ether {{ETH}} ETF back in 2021, almost three years before the SEC began to engage with issuers that now include BlackRock, Fidelity, Ark Invest and others. An additional filing was lodged in September last year.  Read more: Solana ETFs and Huge SOL Gains a Real Possibility Under Trump, Major Crypto Trader Says  ""We believe the native token, SOL, functions similarly to other digital commodities such as bitcoin and ETH,"" VanEck's head of digital assets research, Matthew Sigel, wrote in a post on X arguing that SOL is a commodity, not a security. ""It is utilized to pay for transaction fees and computational services on the blockchain,"" he wrote.  Sigel added that VanEck filed for a solana ETF because the blockchain acts as a competitor to Ethereum with a ""unique combination of scalability, speed, and low costs.""  The SEC approved the first spot bitcoin {{BTC}} ETF in January, while an ether ETF appears to be on the near horizon. Analysts are predicting that ETH ETFs would lure $5 billion of net inflows in the first five months.  Several experts have said that if an ETH ETF is approved, the next coin to be packaged into such a fund would be SOL because its similarities to the second-largest cryptocurrency classify it as a commodity. They suggested, however, that serious conversations around such a product wouldn't start until 2025. Standard Chartered Bank analyst Geoffrey Kendric also considered Ripple's XRP to be a possible option.  ""[My] early thoughts are that this only has a shot to launch sometime in 2025 if we have a new admin in the White House and SEC,"" Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart wrote in a post on X.

30035412,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=626673,1719493209,"Fears Of Bitcoin Sales By US And German Govts Are FUD, Even Bullish: Experts","Amidst waves of concern surrounding the sale of Bitcoin by the US and German governments, industry experts have come forward to dispel fears, suggesting that these moves could be bullish for the market. Yesterday, the Bitcoin sector experienced heightened volatility following actions by two major governments. The German Federal Criminal Police (BKA) continued with its sales of Bitcoin, reducing its holdings from 50,000 BTC to 45,264 BTC. Concurrently, the US government transferred 4,000 BTC to Coinbase, likely aiming for liquidation, retaining a substantial 213,546 BTC in its reserves. Why This Is Bullish For Bitcoin (Long-Term) Travis Kling, founder of Ikigai Asset Management, remarked on the synchronicity of these events. “All at the same time—US Govt selling seized Silk Road Bitcoin, US Govt selling seized Banmeet Singh BTC, German Govt selling seized Movie2k BTC, Mt Gox distributing BTC after a decade. Interesting… I can’t help but look at all these actions and wonder about some kind of coordination/underlying intention,” Kling stated via X. Related Reading: Bitcoin Near ‘Euphoria’ Boundary: What Happens After A Breach? Despite concerns that these sales could pressure Bitcoin prices, experts argue that the impact on the market is likely minimal. Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, countered the prevalent fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD). He noted, “US gov’t sold 4K Bitcoin today, but it’s less likely to impact the market. Coinbase Prime handled 20-49K BTC in sell-side liquidity daily during high spot ETF inflows and 6-15K daily during low spot ETF inflows. Posting this because I’m tired of ‘gov’t selling’ FUDs,” as shared via X. Crypto analyst Skew (@52kskew) provided insights into how these transactions typically occur, “US Gov sent 3.94K BTC to Coinbase Prime to be handled by Coinbase Institutional. There’s typically two options here: OTC desks can auction off the BTC to clients (off-market buyers), or an open market auction (sold over time on the market).” Skew’s explanation makes it clear that the impact on the price is likely to be rather small. Adam Cochran, managing partner at CEHV, highlighted the resilience of Bitcoin in light of multiple bearish catalysts, “Also with US Gov FUD, Mt Gox FUD, most major airdrops finished, markets down, Nvidia off highs, BTC has had every reason to go lower, and it’s still mostly held $60k. Negative news struggling to make a dent.” Will Gold’s History Repeat Itself For BTC? Echoing a historically bullish sentiment, Alistar Milne, CIO of Altana Digital, drew parallels to past government sales of assets, “Government selling is bullish. Gordon Brown famously sold the UK’s Gold reserves for less than $300/ounce. One of the worst decisions made by a Chancellor of the Exchequer, ever. Germany & America are making far worse mistakes by selling seized BTC now. They can only sell once.” Government selling is bullish Gordon Brown famously sold the UK’s Gold reserves for less than $300/ounce. One of the worst decisions made by a Chancellor of the Exchequer, ever Germany & America are making far worse mistakes by selling seized BTC now. They can only sell once pic.twitter.com/i0rZMpuiS0 — Alistair Milne (@alistairmilne) June 26, 2024 For context, during his tenure as Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1997 to 2007, Gordon Brown made the decision to sell approximately 60% of the UK’s gold reserves between 1999 and 2002, a period known as the “Brown Bottom.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Selloff: German Gov’t Offloads Another $67 Million As Price Wobbles The sales were conducted in a series of auctions at prices that ranged between $256 and $296 per ounce—significantly below the gold price in subsequent years, which saw a substantial rise. This action is widely regarded as a financial misstep that cost the UK treasury billions in potential revenue, as gold prices surged to over $1,500 per ounce in the following decades. Moreover, there’s another bullish aspect to this. The finalization of these BTC sales could remove a significant overhang on the market as these sales are hanging above the market like a Damocles sword; once done, there’s a major downside risk for the market forever eliminated, better early than late. At press time, BTC traded at $61,117.

42407944,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga8JHV,1719493200,"Solana ETFs and Huge SOL Gains a Real Possibility Under Trump, Major Crypto Trader Says","Under the Biden administration, Solana {{SOL}} appears nowhere close to getting its own ETF in the U.S. But, according to market-making firm GSR, if Donald Trump retakes the White House, it might be closer than many observers think and price-wise have far more upside than bitcoin {{BTC}} did when its spot ETF debuted.  The U.S. presidential election could provide a breakthrough for additional crypto ETFs like SOL, per the research note shared with CoinDesk. If Trump becomes president again, he could shake up the established playbook for launching crypto ETFs, which usually takes years and starts with the introduction of federally regulated futures contracts – something solana lacks.  ""It may even be probable"" that his theoretical administration implements permissive digital asset regulations that allow for the launch of ""myriad spot digital asset ETFs,"" the note said. If that came to pass, SOL, one of the biggest crypto assets behind BTC and Ethereum's ether {{ETH}} (which already have U.S. ETFs), could be the first to benefit.  ""Solana is poised for a spot ETF if and when additional spot digital asset ETFs are allowed in the US, and the impact on price may just be the largest yet,"" the market maker's note said.  Read more: VanEck Files for Solana ETF, SOL Rises 8%  Solana is one of only a handful of crypto assets with strong market demand whose network also has a high degree of decentralization, according to GSR's in-house calculations. The market maker said those attributes are expected to guide prospective ETF issuers' willingness to pursue a listing.  Bitcoin's price more than doubled in the months preceding and following its spot ETF launch, GSR said. If SOL sees just 5% of the inflows that BTC did, its price could more than triple. GSR considered that inflow rate a ""base case"" because Solana investment products saw 5% of the inflows of bitcoin between 2021 and the end of 2023, before crypto ETF fever took hold.  ""Blue sky"" inflow rates of 14% could see Solana's price shoot up nearly ninefold, per the GSR note. The figures are only a fraction of bitcoin's, but given Solana's smaller size have far greater potential for price action.  Political uncertainty  There's no ETF price action for solana without a solana ETF. And the asset hasn't checked the all-important box of having traded for years in a federally regulated futures market, as bitcoin and ether (widely expected to soon have its own ETF) did. That means it's years away from launch under the current playbook.  ""All you really need is for Donald Trump to become president and then you're subject to whatever he wants to do,"" said GSR Senior Strategist Brian Rudick, who wrote the memo.  If Trump both wins the election and follows through on his campaign trail crypto promises he could bring about the changes necessary for SOL to have a short-term chance at becoming an ETF.  But that's a big if. And the market hasn't exactly signaled an embrace of that ""if,"" if one niche metric for tracking the likelihood of various crypto ETF launches, the discrepancy in pricing for Grayscale's crypto trust products, is referenced.  ""If there were greater odds of a SOL ETF, what you would see is the price of Grayscale Solana Trust (GSOL) collapse,"" he said.  GSOL was trading at around a 750% premium to net asset value at press time, a staggering discrepancy that Rudick also said would collapse if Grayscale converted it to an ETF, as happened to its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) when that became an ETF.  Rudick cautioned the comparison isn't ironclad because GSOL doesn't have much liquidity, meaning its holders don't have too many willing buyers to dump their overpriced trust shares on.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH | SOL,BTC | ETH | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/06/27/solana-etfs-and-huge-sol-gains-a-real-possibility-under-trump-major-crypto-trader-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/83253d2db5af5aed28b38e16a68df36db4cb9956-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42407954,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga8Jee,1719493116,Crypto Markets to See Selling Pressure in July From Mt. Gox Creditors: JPMorgan,"JPMorgan said crypto markets are faced with downside risk due to potential selling pressure from Mt. Gox creditors in July.  Creditors are set to receive 142K bitcoin and there are concerns that some will dump their tokens as soon as they receive them, the report said.  The bank said crypto markets are expected to rebound in August.  Cryptocurrency markets are faced with downside risk in July due to potential selling pressure from the creditors of defunct bitcoin {{BTC}} exchange Mt. Gox, JPMorgan (JPM) said in a research report on Wednesday.  The trustee of Mt.Gox exchange said earlier this week that it would make repayments to creditors in July. JPMorgan notes that the announcement unsettled crypto markets due to concerns that some creditors will dump their bitcoin in July as soon as they receive them. Creditors are set to receive 142,000 bitcoin worth about $9 billion at current prices.  “This fear is justified given the recent behavior of Gemini creditors which are assumed to have liquidated part of the crypto assets received in recent weeks,” analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote.  The bank said by looking at the negative price action in crypto markets since May 29th, it is “fair to assume that some of Gemini creditors, which are mostly retail customers, have taken at least partial profit in recent weeks.” Gemini announced on May 29 that its Gemini Earn users had received all their digital assets back in-kind, following its settlement with Genesis.  JPMorgan notes that while there is an October deadline for repayment to Mt Gox. creditors, most of the reimbursements are expected to happen in July.  If most of the liquidations by Mt. Gox creditors do occur in July, crypto markets are expected to sell off next month then rebound in August, the report said.  Cash payments to creditors of bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, expected some time after October 7, could support markets but the problem is that there is a gap of about three months between potential Mt. Gox creditor selling and FTX creditor reinvestment later in the year, the report added.  Read more: Mt.

42407963,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga8KBi,1719489660,First Mover Americas: BTC’s Recovery Stalls as Dollar Rallies,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin's recovery from Monday's low under $59,000 stalled as buyers struggled to keep momentum above $61,000. Ether and the wider crypto market, represented by the CoinDesk 20 (CD20) Index, also faced lackluster trading during European hours. The pause coincides with the dollar index (DXY) topping 106, the highest since May 2, keeping investor risk appetite under check ahead of U.S. first-quarter GDP data, durable goods for May and a weekly jobless report scheduled for 12:30 UTC (08:30 EST). ""The market may be most sensitive to the weekly jobless claims, given the recent increase and a growing sense, articulated by San Francisco Fed President Daly, that the labor market appears to be at an inflection point,"" Bannockburn Global Forex's managing director and chief market strategist, Marc Chandler, said in a market update. Crypto traders will closely watch the Biden-Trump presidential debate, set for 21:00 EST, for clues on what the outcome of November's election might mean for the industry.  Consensus is fast building that demand for U.S.-based spot ether ETFs may not be as strong as for bitcoin ETFs. On Wednesday, Galaxy Research said the ETFs, once approved, could see $1 billion of net inflows a month.“We expect the net inflows into ETH ETFs to be 20-50% of the net inflows into BTC ETFs over the first five months, with 30% as our target, implying $1 billion/month of net inflows,” analyst Charles Yu wrote. Galaxy also warned that demand may be limited due to the lack of staking rewards, echoing comments by Bernstein and JPMorgan and said outflows from the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) may act as a drag on the overall inflows. The SEC could approve the funds as soon as July 4, according to a Reuters report on Thursday. Options traders foresee a renewed bullish momentum in ether after that date.  Bitcoin miner Marathon Digital (MARA) has become a multicoin miner to diversify its revenue stream as the recent Bitcoin halving cut profits by 50% and made the industry more competitive. The company has mined 93 million kaspa (KAS) tokens since September 2023, valued at about $15 million, and brought 30 petahash worth of machines online to mine the token, while 30 more will be starting by the third quarter. “By mining Kaspa, we are able to create a stream of revenue that is diversified from Bitcoin, and that is directly tied to our core competencies in digital asset compute,” said Adam Swick, Marathon’s chief growth officer in a statement.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows recent activity in ether December expiry options at various strike price levels.  The concentration of volumes in higher strike call options shows a bullish bias.  ""This could be due to the improving regulatory outlook around ETH over the past month. Last week, the SEC dropped its case against Consensys regarding ETH’s potential status as a security,"" Kaiko said.

The DEX also received an undisclosed amount of investment from Flow Traders ahead of the token roll-out.  Decentralized orderbook exchange Bluefin will launch its governance token in July after securing total of $17 million in funding since its inception in 2020.  The exchange - which lets users trade crypto perpetual swaps on the Sui network - also recently received an undisclosed amount of investment from trading giant Flow Traders ahead of the token unveiling. Bluefin will use the proceeds to expand beyond perpetual trading and develop a decentralized financial ecosystem, the firm said in a statement to CoinDesk.  Bluefin claims to be a leading derivatives exchange in the Sui network and has captured over 70% market share with its perpetual trading product. Its upcoming token, BLUE, will help the firm decentralize decision-making processes while incentivizing users and contributors.  “Our vision is to accelerate the adoption of decentralized finance by bringing a sustainable, powerful, and user-friendly exchange to the market.” Said Zabi Mohebzada, co-founder of Bluefin.  Decentralized exchanges or DEXs became popular during the crypto winter after some large centralized platforms (CEXs), such as Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX, imploded dramatically. DEXs are self-executing, meaning they can coordinate the trading of digital assets between users using automated algorithms and forgo the human element.  Perpetual swaps, unique to crypto, are financial products that are essentially futures contracts without an expiration date.  The BLUE token will have a maximum supply of 1 billion and an initial circulating supply of 116 million, according to a tokenomics document seen by CoinDesk. Investors and Bluefin's team will have a three-year vesting period with a lockup that will expire one year after the initial roll-out next month. It also plans to allocate 32.5% of the token for user incentives that will include airdrops, trading rewards, liquidity provisions and future growth initiatives, according to the document.  The DEX is also planning to start an aggregator for trading spot digital assets and ""Bluefin Pro,"" which will offer cross-margin trading and faster executions.  Bluefin raised funds from major hedge funds, including Brevan Howard Digital, Tower Research, Cumberland DRW, and Susquehanna International Group. The exchange said it has seen more than $25 billion in trading volume so far this year and monthly revenues exceeding $1 million.

30032407,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=626642,1719487853,"Cardano (ADA) Faces Further Decline, $0.3389 Support Under Threat","Cardano (ADA) is currently experiencing a downward trend, with its price approaching the crucial support level of $0.3389. The cryptocurrency market has been under significant bearish pressure, and ADA is no exception. This decline is fueled by a mix of macroeconomic factors, market sentiment, and technical indicators pointing to continued weakness. As Cardano nears this critical support level, investors and traders are closely monitoring its performance to determine if it can hold the line or if further declines are imminent. The $0.3389 level is now a key focus for the market, potentially shaping ADA’s short-term future. With the help of technical indicators, this analysis focuses on analyzing Cardano’s current price action and its impact on the asset’s future focusing on the 4-hour and the 1-day timeframe. Presently, the market capitalization of Cardano is over $13 billion, with a trading volume of over $252 million. The cryptocurrency price is currently down by 2.94%, trading at roughly $0.3786. Despite a 2.91% decrease in market capitalization, there has been a 10.38% increase in trading volume in the past day. Review Of Recent Market Performance Of Cardano Currently, the price of ÀDA is actively bearish trading below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) in the 4-hour timeframe. Due to this Cardano is beginning to decline towards the $0.3389 support after a failed upward attempt. With this current price action, it can be suggested that ADA’s bearish trend may likely extend. Also, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) confirms that the price of ADA may extend its decline toward the $0.3389 support zone as the signal line of the indicator has dropped below 50% and is heading towards the oversold zone. Meanwhile, on the 1-day chart, ADA’s price is trading below the 100-day SMA dropping towards the $0.3389 support level with strong bearish momentum after short-term upward recovering. Additionally, with the formation of the 1-day RSI, it can be suggested that Cardano poses more of a threat to extending its decline as the signal line of the indicator is actively trending below 50% attempting to make another drop towards the oversold zone. Strategies For Navigating ADA’s Decline An analysis of potential key levels to look out for reveals that ADA’s price may continue to move downward toward the $0.3389 support level. Should the crypto asset break below this level, it may move lower to test the $0.2388 support level and probably move on to test other lower levels if the price breaches this level. However, if there is a rejection at the $0.3389 support level, Cardano may start moving upward toward the $0.5229 resistance level. If this level is breached, the crypto asset may experience more price growth toward the $0.6822 resistance level and possibly other levels above.

The roadmap, setting out a development plan for the next two years, calls for splitting off transaction execution into a separate ""canonical rollup"" that would support ""atomic transactions across smart contracts written in different programming languages."" The main Tezos blockchain would serve as a base layer for consensus and settlement.  The post was co-authored by developer teams from Nomadic Labs, TriliTech and Functori.  Tezos, founded by the husband-wife team of Arthur and Kathleen Breitman, raised a record-smashing $232 million in an initial coin offering in 2017, and was at one point seen as one of the most promising smart-contract blockchain projects to rival Ethereum.  But the project has struggled to stay in the top ranks, with a token market capitalization of $749 million, roughly the 80th biggest project based on CoinDesk data. The native XTZ token is 92% off its all-time high.  In 2022, developers started pushing to scale up the Tezos network, according to a blog post.  ""Central to this strategy areSmart Rollups, a scaling technology where an optimized and dedicated second layer executes transactions, while consensus and settlement remain guaranteed"" by the layer-1 blockchain, according to the post.  Another key feature is a dedicated data-availability layer on the Tezos main network.  The new roadmap bears a resemblance to the scaling efforts that Ethereum has pursued for the past several years, where transaction execution is offloaded to auxiliary layer-2 networks. New ""modular"" components have sprung up to handle other functions handled by the main Ethereum chain, such as efficiently storing reams of data.  ""In order to scale and maintain decentralization, Tezos has evolved from a monolithic to a modular design, where interconnected groups of nodes take on different roles - all the while maintaining an integrated experience for builders and users,"" according to the post.  What's different about the Tezos plan is that the transaction execution could be handled by a single rollup rather than multiple layer-2 networks, as is the case on Ethereum.  ""In theory, one rollup is all that’s needed to meet the requirements of all but the most extreme use cases,"" the post reads. ""That’s what Tezos X envisions: the creation of a single canonical rollup able to handle - and massively expand - all activity on the Tezos network.""

30038754,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=626736,1719484582,Revolutionizing the Memecoin Market: How RVLS Token Stands Apart with Community and Innovation,"In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, memecoins often come under scrutiny for their lack of inherent value and functionality. Amidst this backdrop, a new contender emerges, promising not just to add vibrancy to the memecoin genre but also to infuse it with purpose and utility. Enter the RVLS Token, from the Rivals: Dogs vs Squirrels project—a venture that distinguishes itself through innovation, community engagement, and a heartfelt mission. The cryptocurrency market is no stranger to projects that rise on hype only to fall when the excitement wanes. However, RVLS aims to rewrite this narrative by building an ecosystem centered around tangible utilities and rewards for its community. The project’s website serves as a comprehensive hub where users can explore the story behind the token, access white papers, view videos, engage with NFT marketplaces, utilize minting dApps, read blog posts, and participate in available games. This multi-faceted approach ensures that $RVLS is not just another token in the vast sea of cryptocurrencies but a cornerstone of a broader digital experience. Why Should You Act Now? The strength of any project lies in its ability to serve and grow its community. The team behind Rivals: Dogs vs Squirrels has demonstrated a commitment to innovation and transparency while offering an array of rewards for participation. At the core of this ecosystem is the RVLS token—fueling transactions, incentivizing users, and driving growth across the platform. What sets $RVLS apart is its unique token distribution model designed to ensure equitable value distribution throughout its ecosystem. With a focus on supporting animal shelters worldwide, $RVLS isn’t just about creating wealth; it’s about making a difference—one small gesture at a time. “Sometimes the smallest gestures can make a real difference in the life of someone else. If you CAN make a difference, you should. Be the change you want to see in the world.” This mantra underscores the ethos driving every decision within this project, from the splitter contracts routing a portion of every transaction to a community designated donations wallet to the Indiegogo campaign designed to help offset product production costs so more proceeds can route directly to donations. The presale phase marks an exciting opportunity for early adopters. With 20% of its total supply available at $0.005 per token during this period, potential investors are encouraged not just by favorable pricing but by aligning themselves with a project possessing strategic vision and robust community support. Moreover, engaging with Rivals: Dogs Vs Squirrels offers more than investment opportunities; it invites users into an inclusive community poised for sustainable growth. Prospective participants are urged to visit their website for whitelist opportunities encompassing private sales, presale events, exclusive NFT discounts among others. Furthermore, joining their new Discord Community opens avenues such as applying for Game Beta Tester roles—demonstrating yet another layer of interaction between the project and its supporters. The dedication of the RVLS team extends beyond mere words; actions like locking their tokens for two years manifest their commitment toward their mission’s success over time; organically stretching its legs and growing steadily without shortcuts. Rivals: Dogs Vs Squirrel’s pre-launch endeavors—including game introductions, NFT marketplaces & collections—further exemplify proactive steps taken towards fulfilling their vision even before official launch dates draw near. The RVLS Token represents more than just an innovative twist within the memecoin realm; it embodies hope for crypto enthusiasts seeking substance over speculation and significance over fleeting trends—merging passion for blockchain technology with compassion towards animal welfare globally. As crypto narratives evolve amidst skepticism and frustrations that surround memecoins that lack function, defined purpose, or future prospects grow—RVLS stands out as a beacon that demonstrates what meme-inspired currencies can achieve when driven by genuine intent, backed by actionable frameworks tailored towards measurable impacts both within virtual economies & real-world scenarios alike. In conclusion, embracing RVLS today might not only signify wise financial involvement but will foster participation in a movement that strives towards attaining collective betterment by bridging the gaps between the cyber finance realm & philanthropic endeavors. RVLS dares to differentiate itself from contemporaries whilst charting paths less traveled that could yield returns that may transcend traditional investment metrics alone. The new RVLS Token invites us all to ponder upon the potential that lies ahead should we choose to embark with them on their journey. RVLS dares to transform how the perceived value of utility within the ever-expanding crypto universe should be measured, and may very well forever change the memecoin landscape with their innovative thoughtfulness and multiple approach inclusion considerations. Connect with RVLS through their social media channels on [Instagram], join the [Discord] community, Follow them on X or [Facebook] for real-time updates about the projects’ progressions including ways to get involved that directly impact lives positively while securing potentially lucrative positions within the rapidly evolving landscape known as cryptocurrency today.

Reports indicate a staggering drop – from a dizzying $75-100 billion to a mere $7 billion in a 24-hour period. This dramatic shift has unsettled the crypto community, raising serious questions about the legitimacy of Solana’s past performance and its future as a DeFi powerhouse. Related Reading: Can Terra Classic Rise From The Ashes? Analyst Foresees 1,500% Price Increase Wash Away The Hype: Inflated Figures Or Fabricated Reality? Market sentinels are pointing fingers at wash trading, a manipulative practice where investors essentially buy and sell crypto back and forth to each other, creating an illusion of high activity. This tactic inflates trading volumes, potentially misleading investors about the true level of adoption and liquidity on the platform. Amazing how Solana went from $75-100 BILLION DAILY stablecoin volume to $7 BILLION daily in 1 day!! Might it be because the data was totally fake??? Like how I’ve been talking about all these months?? And by the way even at $7 Billion 90% of the volume is still fake https://t.co/CnKWGAbjsM pic.twitter.com/ScfCgv5UhS — Wazz (@WazzCrypto) June 25, 2024 The discrepancy is too large to ignore. While some wash trading might occur on any exchange, a legitimate DeFi ecosystem shouldn’t be so heavily reliant on it. This raises serious concerns about the organic growth of Solana’s stablecoin market. The finger of suspicion falls particularly on USDC, a leading stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. Experts estimate that even with the revised $7 billion volume figure, a staggering 90% could still be inflated. This throws a wrench into Solana’s narrative as a DeFi leader, potentially shaking investor confidence. Investor Jitters And The Road To Redemption The sudden data plunge has unnerved investors who made decisions based on the previously reported figures. This could lead to a sell-off, causing short-term volatility in the Solana market. Additionally, the revelation comes at a sensitive time – just ahead of the highly anticipated Ethereum ETF deadline, which some believe could have boosted Solana’s DeFi activity further. This is a major blow to Solana’s credibility. Investors need to be able to trust the data they’re basing their decisions on. Regaining that trust will require a swift and transparent response from Solana’s development team. SOL market cap currently at $63 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Beyond The Hype: Does Solana Still Have DeFi Potential? While the data debacle undoubtedly casts a shadow on Solana’s recent performance, it doesn’t negate the platform’s strong technological foundation. Solana boasts one of the fastest and most scalable blockchains in existence, making it a technically sound option for DeFi applications.

42407949,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga8JUj,1719481691,Ether Spot ETFs Could See $5B of Net Inflows in the First Five Months: Galaxy,"Galaxy said spot ether ETFs could see $5 billion of net inflows in the first five months.  Demand for the new products is expected to come from independent investment advisors and broker/dealer platforms.  The lack of staking rewards could limit demand for these spot ETFs, the report said.  Ether {{ETH}} spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), once approved for trading, could see $1 billion of net inflows a month, Galaxy (GLXY) Research said in a report on Wednesday.  “We expect the net inflows into ETH ETFs to be 20-50% of the net inflows into BTC ETFs over the first five months, with 30% as our target, implying $1 billion/month of net inflows,” analyst Charles Yu wrote.  Ether ETFs are close to becoming available for trading in the U.S. after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved filings from applicants last month. The regulator must also approve their S-1 filings before the products are cleared to trade. Spot bitcoin ETFs launched in the U.S. in January.  Similar to the bitcoin {{BTC}} spot ETFs, new demand for the ether versions is expected to come from independent investment advisors or broker/dealer platforms, the report said.  Ether will be more price sensitive to ETF inflows than bitcoin due to the amount of total supply of ETH that is locked in staking, bridges, and smart contracts, and the lower amount held on centralized exchanges, Galaxy said.  Galaxy cautioned that spot ether ETF demand may be limited due to the lack of staking rewards.  Outflows from the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) will also likely be a drag on ether ETF inflows, and Galaxy estimates that these negative flows could be about 319,000 ETH per month or $1.1 billion. Still, due to the smaller percentage of ether held in these trusts the “ETHE ETF conversion will be a relatively smaller drag on ETH price relative than the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) conversion.”  Unlike GBTC, ETHE is not faced with forced selling due to bankruptcy from the likes of 3AC and Genesis, which supports the notion that ether will see less selling pressure related to Grayscale trusts than bitcoin, the report added.  The SEC could approve spot ether ETFs as soon as July 4, according to a Reuters report on Thursday.

Analysts say State Street will provide administrative and accounting services for the new fund.  State Street Global Advisors and Galaxy Asset Management said they are working together to build crypto products that offer exposure to crypto companies as well as spot and futures-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs).  State Street Global Advisors, a unit of financial services giant State Street (STT), filed an application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to register a crypto-based fund called the SSGA Active Trust. Galaxy will be responsible for the day-to-day management of the fund’s investments, according to the filing. The company is affiliated with Galaxy Digital (GLXY), a financial services company that specializes in digital assets.  Together, the companies ""will provide investors access to the $2.4 trillion digital asset ecosystem through manager-directed strategies,"" the companies said in a statement.  While the cryptocurrency industry has gained greater recognition since the U.S. approval of spot bitcoin ETFs in January, ""investors are also seeking exposure to this growing asset class through investment options beyond pure spot bitcoin,"" they said.  “We believe that the digital assets landscape is so much more than the single crypto components and that crypto native companies are best equipped to understand that ecosystem and its correlation with financial markets,” Anna Paglia, State Street Global Advisors chief business officer said in the statement.  State Street and Galaxy's latest effort is a testament to crypto's growing popularity as an asset class. In April 2023, Galaxy Digital established a similar partnership in place with DWS to develop crypto management solutions for Europe.  ""The expectation is that State Street Bank and Trust would provide administrative and accounting services for the new digital assets ETFs that State Street Global Advisors and Galaxy jointly develop pursuant to this collaboration. The announcement appears short on detail,"" said Laurent Kssis, crypto ETF specialist at CEC Capital.

30025639,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=626624,1719476100,Buy Crypto Now: Lekker Capital CIO Spotlights Prime Opportunity,"Quinn Thompson, Chief Investment Officer (CIO) at Lekker Capital, articulated a strong buy signal for cryptocurrencies amidst a landscape fraught with bearish sentiment. In a statement released through the social media platform X, Thompson described the present market conditions as “one of the most obvious and attractive crypto buying opportunities of recent memory.” Lekker Capital, which has carved a niche in trading cryptocurrencies based on macroeconomic cues, provides an analysis that contrasts sharply with the prevailing market mood. Thompson’s commentary comes at a time when the broader crypto community appears enmeshed in pessimism. He expressed concern over the current trend where it’s become fashionable among crypto investors to adopt a bearish stance. “In all of my 5 years in crypto, I have never seen it be so ‘cool’ amongst crypto native investors as it is right now to be bearish,” Thompson noted, reflecting on the cyclical nature of market sentiments. Related Reading: ‘Crypto Queen’ Wanted: FBI Puts $5 Million Price Tag On OneCoin Founder’s Arrest Thompson pointed to the reactive nature of the market, particularly surrounding major events like ETF launches. He revisited the aftermath of the US spot Bitcoin ETF launch, which contrary to the bullish anticipation, saw Bitcoin’s price plunge from $49,000 to $38,000, marking a steep 22% decline in just 12 days. This event, he argued, should serve as a cautionary tale about the market’s tendency to move against consensus expectations. Addressing the most recent market dynamics, Thompson highlighted the significant impact of the sell-off that dampened the spirits of market participants, discouraging the usual strategies of buying the dip with leveraged positions. “It’s clear this most recent selloff has finally stung market participants given the lack of leveraged long dip buying,” he observed. This scenario, according to him, sets the stage for a market correction that typically follows a pattern of initial slow recovery, stabilization, and then a rapid upward movement once a catalytic event occurs. He recalled the BTC ETF leak in October as a “buy the news” event that realigned market sentiment. Furthermore, Thompson discussed the forward-looking nature of financial markets, emphasizing that the crypto market is no exception. He believes that the market has already adjusted to past events such as the Mt. Gox saga and Bitcoin sell-offs from the US and German governments. “The key thing to remember here is markets are forward looking. Citing the Mt. Gox or US and German government supply overhangs is old news – the market has priced this in. Fear and capitulation invokes an irrational near-sightedness,” the Lekker Capital CIO remarked. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Bitcoin Bottom Is In, New Highs Imminent: Crypto Expert Looking ahead, he underscored several macro and microeconomic developments poised to influence the market. “On the macro front, these include a November election and additional Fed liquidity. On the micro front, they are the ETH ETF, Circle IPO, and improved BTC miner profitability thanks to AI,” he explained. These factors are expected to reduce selling pressure (e.g. Bitcoin miners) and invigorate market sentiment. Delving deeper into market technicals, Thompson pointed out that several key indicators are at cycle lows, which historically precede upward movements. He noted, “BTC and ETH CME basis, alt open interest as a percentage of total, and macro relative value all sit at cycle lows while stablecoin supply is finally growing again.” This combination of factors, according to Thompson, signals a potential market bottom forming. In a bold closing prediction, Thompson projected significant rallies for major cryptocurrencies in the near future. “Personally, I think ETH will reach $7,000 and BTC will make its first attempt at $100,000 by the election in November,” he stated confidently. At press time, BTC traded at $60,766.

The RariMe team had earlier launched an anonymous, blockchain-powered referendum on the legitimacy of Vladimir Putin’s victory in Russia’s election.  Rarimo has unveiled RariMe, a competitor to Worldcoin, and an app that allows users to generate passport zero-knowledge proofs (ZKs) verifying their uniqueness without revealing their identity, the company announced on Thursday.  Unlike Worldcoin which uses orbs to scan eyeballs, Rarimo uses smartphones to scan passports and verify its users. Identify frameworks usually have a third party approve credentials but ZKs ensure no personal data is shared while verifying identities.  ""The same way that a decentralized application (Dapp) could gate something with proof of humanity, they can now do the same with proof of citizenship, or proof of age and simply request the proofs,"" Kitty Horlick, Director of Rarimo provider Rarilabs told CoinDesk.  Rarimo was the tech team behind launching the anonymous, blockchain-powered referendum on the legitimacy of Vladimir Putin’s victory in Russia’s election earlier this year.  The first demo use case will see Rarimo use passport ZKs to drop programmable airdrops to citizens of particular countries.

Crypto traders will closely watch the debate, as Trump has made digital assets a vital issue in his presidential campaign.  The consensus among the crypto community seems to be that a Trump victory would be favorable for the industry.  The crypto market showed no signs of excitement ahead of Thursday's pivotal U.S. Presidential debate between incumbent Joe Biden and his crypto-friendly Republican candidate, Donald Trump.  At 04:56 UTC, TRUMP, the first major token in the PoliFi sector, traded near $8.5, representing a 0.5% drop on a 24-hour basis. Its Solana-based counterpart TREMP traded 7.2% lower at 74 cents and the Joe Biden-themed BODEN coin was 16% at 13 cents, according to data source Coingecko. Meanwhile, bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, traded 1% lower at $61,000.  Per TS Lombard, the first presidential debate of 2024, set for Thursday at 21:00 ET, is likely to bring ""a few voter surprises but has the potential to recast if not shape up a dead heat race.""  ""If shaky Biden underperforms his rival, pressure from big Democrat donors to ditch his candidacy will surge, especially with Biden now trailing on fundraising for the second straight month. If Trump goes off the rails, Republicans may wince, but the GOP ticket won't change. Rather, the onus will shift to Trump's as-yet-announced VP pick to steady his campaign,"" TS Lombard said in a note to clients on Tuesday.  ""In both cases, the bar (set by the first truculent Trump-Biden debate) is low, but the stakes are high,"" Lombard added.  The crypto industry has lobbied to ensure digital assets are discussed in the televised presidential faceoff, and potential comments from the two candidates could inject volatility into the market.  Crypto traders will closely watch the debate, as Trump has made digital assets a vital issue in his presidential campaign by courting industry leaders and recently stressing the need to mine all remaining bitcoin in the U.S. As such, the crypto is now seen as a Trump trade, with Standard Chartered anticipating a record rally in BTC to $150,000 on a potential Trump victory.  Meanwhile, Biden has been silent, having asked federal agencies to explore risks and opportunities, including the potential debut of a Fed-managed central bank digital currency.  ""Ahead of tonight's first presidential debate, crypto traders will be watching keenly for clues as to what November's election could mean for Bitcoin and the wider sector,"" said Neil Roarty, analyst at investment platform Stocklytics in an email to CoinDesk.  ""The consensus among the crypto community seems to be that a Trump victory would be favorable for the industry. Aside from the vocal support he’s given, bitcoin has tended to perform well during periods of political and economic uncertainty, and a second Trump presidency will likely see more of both,"" Roarty added.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/06/27/polifi-tokens-btc-under-pressure-ahead-of-biden-trump-debate,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1808dbd3ad92315a6b313f0290d4e4c8b31d0e24-4855x2731.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

However, ADA failed to clear the $0.40 resistance zone. A high was formed at $0.3967 and the price started a fresh decline. There was a move below the $0.3880 and $0.3865 support levels.

The first resistance is near $0.3880. The next key resistance might be $0.40. If there is a close above the $0.40 resistance, the price could start a strong rally.

Bitcoin Is Not Far From This Long-Term Holder Cost Basis Level According to the latest weekly report from Glassnode, BTC’s recent consolidation has been near the historical boundary between the ‘equilibrium’ and ‘euphoria’ phases of the bull market. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Tied To BitMEX Whales: Quant Uncovers Link The level in question multiplies the Realized Price for the long-term holders. The Realized Price here refers to an on-chain metric that, in short, keeps track of the average cost basis of the investors on the Bitcoin network. When the cryptocurrency’s spot price is higher than this indicator, the investors can be assumed to be holding a net amount of unrealized profit. Similarly, the asset’s value under the metric could suggest the dominance of losses on the blockchain. In the context of the current topic, the Realized Price, specifically for the “long-term holders” (LTH), is of interest. The LTHs refer to the Bitcoin investors who have held onto their coins for more than 155 days without having sold/transferred them on the network. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Realized Price of the LTHs, as well as a couple of its multiples, over the past decade: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin LTH Realized Price is trading around $21,800 right now. This is significantly lower than the current spot price of the asset, so this cohort would be holding considerable profits currently. Statistically, the longer an investor holds their BTC stack, the less likely they become to sell the coins at any point. As such, the LTHs, who tend to hold for long periods, include the most resolute holders in the market. This group doesn’t react easily to market events, like rallies or crashes. That said, when their gains grow very large, even these HODLers start getting tempted by the allure of profit-taking. Historically, this has happened as the Bitcoin market has approached the ‘euphoria’ phase. Glassnode defines it as that market phase when the price breaks above the 3.5x multiplier of the LTH Realized Price. This level currently stands at $76,400, just above the consolidation range the cryptocurrency has recently been stuck in. The chart shows that during the past two bull runs, the asset’s price blew up when it broke past this level. Related Reading: This Historical Ethereum Top Signal Is Yet To Appear This Cycle It remains to be seen how long Bitcoin takes to breach this boundary to escape from the current ‘equilibrium’ phase and fill investors with euphoria.

One important fact about this triangle formation is the fact that it led to a significant rally seven years ago, and if history repeats itself, then XRP may be set for a bullish wave. XRP Triangle Formation Signals Bullish Continuation In an analysis on TradingView, crypto analyst TradingShot pointed out that the XRP price is seeing another triangle formation. This formation comes from the culmination of a number of indicators, all of which have become bullish during this time. Related Reading: Analysts Battle Over Cardano’s Next Move: 12,000% Rally Or 50% Crash? The indicators pointed out by the crypto analyst include the price closing below its 1W MA50 and 1W MA200. While, at first glance, this could look bearish, it can be a bit signal that propels the price up as investors start to get back in at low prices. This is also made obvious by the 1W RSI dropping to 40.00, as historically, this indicator at this level has always presented a buying opportunity. Furthermore, the crypto analyst points out that the XRP price is currently testing the bottom with the higher lows trend line. All of these have come together to form a triangle structure that has not been seen since 2013-2017. This triangle structure is important given that the last time it appeared in 2013 and eventually broke out in 2017, the XRP price went on to rally to new all-time highs. Therefore, the appearance of this triangle structure this time around could signal the start of another bullish trend that pushes the altcoin’s price toward new all-time highs as well. How Far Can The Price Go? In the scenario where the XRP price does follow the 2013-2017 trend and a breakout occurs, the crypto analyst does see the price reaching a new all-time high. However, for this to happen and for the bullish trend to be confirmed, the price will have to break above the 1W MA200, as the analyst explains. Related Reading: Crypto Research Firm Says Bitcoin Crash Below $60,000 May Not Be The End, Here’s Why In such a case that the altcoin does break this important level, TradingShot puts the price as high as $4.5. Such a move would mean an over 800% increase in value from where the XRP price is currently sitting at $0.47. However, as with any bullish scenario, there is also the possibility that the trend fails to actualize. In the event that the price does not break the 1W MA200, the crypto analyst advises “that the XRP army will need a need narrative to hang on to, as the long-term pattern would have failed them.” Featured image created with Dall.E, chart from Tradingview.com",POSITIVE,XRP,ADA | ALTCOIN | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/triangle-formation-2017-xrp-rally/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

This development comes as part of a joint investigation conducted by Bulgarian and American authorities into a large-scale financial fraud and money laundering scheme. One Of The FBI’s Most Wanted Bulgaria’s temporary chief prosecutor, Borislav Sarafov, highlighted the collaborative efforts between Bulgarian and US law enforcement agencies in tackling the case. Sarafov emphasized the ongoing investigations in both countries against Ignatova, who is facing charges related to the notorious OneCoin financial pyramid scheme. Furthermore, Sarafov revealed plans to initiate legal proceedings in Bulgaria, aiming to charge Ignatova in absentia and facilitate the seizure of assets acquired through illicit means. Related Reading: Can Terra Classic Rise From The Ashes? Analyst Foresees 1,500% Price Increase US Ambassador Kenneth Merten underscored the gravity of the charges against Ignatova, labeling the OneCoin scheme as one of the largest frauds in history. Victims of this scheme have allegedly been defrauded of over $4 billion. Plamen Tonchev, the head of Bulgaria’s State Agency “National Security” (SANS), shed light on Ignatova’s role in the OneCoin scheme, describing it as a “fraudulent financial operation” closely resembling a pyramid scheme. The Rise And Fall Of OneCoin The story of OneCoin dates back to 2014, when Ruja Ignatova founded the company, claiming that it functioned just like any other cryptocurrency. However, it was revealed that there was no authentic OneCoin blockchain model or payment system. As questions and investigations started to arise in multiple countries, with some labeling it a pyramid scheme, the credibility of OneCoin began to crumble. The Norwegian Direct Selling Association was among the first to denounce the fraud as a pyramid scheme in March 2016, followed by a warning from the Hungarian Central Bank in May of the same year. Related Reading: Bitcoin Selloff: German Gov’t Offloads Another $67 Million As Price Wobbles In 2017, OneCoin falsely claimed to be the first company licensed by the Vietnamese government for use as a digital currency, a claim that Vietnam promptly refuted. The following year, the Bulgarian police raided OneCoin’s office, resulting in Ignatova’s disappearance when an arrest warrant was issued. Ignatova’s brother, Konstantin Ignatov, subsequently assumed company leadership, while co-founder Sebastian Greenwood was arrested in 2018. Konstantin himself was apprehended in November 2019 and later pleaded guilty to fraud and money laundering charges. Ignatova, a fugitive since evading arrest by fleeing from Sofia to Athens in 2017, was added to the FBI’s 10 Most Wanted Fugitives list in 2022.

42407956,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga8JoZ,1719454865,UPDATE: Polymarket Says It's 'Conclusive' Barron Trump Was Involved in $DJT,"In a rare move, Polymarket has contradicted its decentralized oracle service UMA with regard to the resolution of a market betting on whether Barron Trump was likely involved with the DJT token.  In a tweet late Thursday, Polymarket said Barron Trump was involved in the token in some way, but did not provide any evidence for the claim.  Neither Barron Trump nor Donald Trump's campaign has made an official statement about the token.  Polymarket has overruled UMA, a decentralized oracle service that referees the fast-growing platform's crypto-based prediction markets, by saying that Barron Trump was involved in the DJT token ""in some way,"" and said it plans to refund holders of the ""yes"" side of the contract – though the X (formerly Twitter) account for the service did not provide any evidence supporting its claim.  Controversy has been brewing for days since UMA resolved a market asking whether it was more likely than not that Barron Trump, son of former U.S. President Donald Trump, was involved in a meme coin called DJT. The oracle service decided several times the answer was ""no,"" but holders of ""yes"" shares protested.  On Wednesday, Polymarket said it believed UMA got it wrong, and it would soon announce a fix. Then, on Thursday, it posted that ""it is conclusive that he was, in fact, involved in some way"" with DJT.  The prediction market also said that aside from refunding holders of the ""yes"" side of the contract, it is ""working to improve our oracle and resolution methodology.""  Polymarket's surprise move is the latest wrinkle in the two-week-long saga of DJT, a Trump-themed memecoin that neither the Trump campaign nor Barron has acknowledged or denied being involved in.  ""This market will resolve to 'Yes' if a preponderance of evidence suggests that Barron Trump was involved in the creation of the Solana token $DJT. Otherwise this market will resolve to 'No,'"" the contract on Polymarket read. ""Determination as to whether Barron was involved in the creation of $DJT will be made by this market's decentralized resolver, UMA, and will take into account all available evidence as of 12 PM ET, June 23.""  Whenever the outcome of a prediction market is disputed, UMA, a decentralized ""optimistic"" oracle, is brought in to resolve it with UMA tokenholders voting on the outcome. In the case of the DJT market, an overwhelming majority of UMA holders voted for the ""no"" resolution.  In total, bettors put more than $1 million on the line, and amid the radio silence from the Trump family and campaign, Martin “Pharma Bro” Shkreli, a convicted felon, has been adamantly making public statements that Barron Trump was involved.  On Wednesday, Shkreli posted a series of screenshots on X purporting to show one of his associates saying that he's ""trying to get Barron to come out of his shell,"" but that lawyers are likely advising the former president's son not to talk.  This isn't the first time UMA as a method of contract resolution has faced controversy. Questions on what it meant to ""find"" the missing OceanGate submersible, which imploded near the wreckage of the Titanic, put its relationship with Polymarket in the spotlight last fall.  In May, this relationship was once again tested when some bettors questioned if an Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) was approved – UMA resolved the contract to yes – or if it was still working its way through the bureaucratic leviathan of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Polymarket CEO Shayne Coplan didn't immediately respond to a request for comments sent by Telegram.

Analyst Predicts 10x Growth In Few Years — Here’s How,"In a recent surge of online discussion, renowned crypto analyst and entrepreneur Willy Woo has made headlines with his optimistic prediction for Bitcoin’s future on Elon Musk’s social media platform, X. Woo suggests that Bitcoin, already gaining traction among traditional financial circles as an emerging asset class, could see exponential growth. He argued that if Bitcoin continues to be perceived at the scale of major asset classes, traditionally valued in the tens of trillions of dollars, it could potentially increase in value tenfold in the coming years. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Correction Is Not Done: $54K Could Be On The Horizon, Says Top Analyst Current Market Dynamics and Predictions Woo’s insight comes at a critical time for Bitcoin, which currently faces fluctuating market conditions. Despite the downturn, he projects that Bitcoin could rival the US dollar and emerge as a global reserve asset by the 2030s, aligning with a projected 25-40% global adoption rate. His stance is rooted in the growing recognition of Bitcoin on Wall Street, highlighting a significant shift in how traditional financial markets are beginning to view digital currencies. Everyone asking “when?” I’d say when we into the range of 25-40% world adoption. I.e. 2030s pic.twitter.com/Sdsw5PNrZM — Willy Woo (@woonomic) June 25, 2024 Despite Woo’s long-term optimism, Bitcoin’s immediate trajectory remains challenged, with recent data indicating a decline. Over the past week, Bitcoin has seen a reduction of 5.3% in value, with a slight 0.1% drop in the last 24 hours, stabilizing at a market price of $61,486. Keith Alan, Co-founder of TeamBlacknox, remains cautiously optimistic, noting that while Bitcoin could retest its lows, the broader trend could remain “intact” if monthly closures stay between $56.5k and $61.8k. Gauging Bitcoin Potential Rebound and Future Growth Adding to the discourse, CryptoQuant analyst Gustavo Faria highlighted signs that Bitcoin might have reached a local bottom. The analysis pointed out a reduction in open interest in the futures market and a drop in funding rates for perpetual contracts, suggesting a balance restoration between buyers and sellers. This equilibrium is crucial for maintaining a healthy market structure without excessive optimism that typically leads to sharp corrections. Signs of a Local Bottom?

This time, iconic heavy metal band Metallica joined the list of public figures involved with Solana tokens. However, the band’s participation in the crypto industry was yet another X account hack targeting investors. Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Have A ‘Red Monday, Green Week’? Analyst Sets $63,500 Target Solana-Based METAL Takes Over Crypto The iconic heavy metal band Metallica recently announced a collaboration with the popular videogame Fortnite. The collaboration seemingly aims to bring the band’s music to a new demographic of music enjoyers. Nonetheless, the announcement was eclipsed by the Metallica X account’s failed “attempt” to “join” a different community. On Tuesday night, the account shared a post offering a Solana-based token to their fans. The post announced the launch of METAL, an alleged collaboration between the band and Ticketmaster. The token was described as a “dynamic new token on the Solana blockchain poised to revolutionize how you experience events and online shopping.” Unlike other celebrity memecoin scams, the token offered utility from the get-go. Users who used METAL to buy concert tickets would receive exclusive Ticketmaster discounts of up to 25%. METAL holders would also get the chance to win free tickets through “exclusive airdrops.” The X posts announced three signed “insanely rare Metal Token Xbox Series X consoles” for the token holders. Additionally, it promised the METAL token would “seamlessly integrate into your shopping experience, powered by the reliability of Solana for effortless transactions.” Master Of Tokens Or Master Of Nothing? Metallica fans and crypto investors quickly became wary of the posts. Users began debating whether the announcements were fake and if the account had been hacked. One X user suggested the band would not “ruin their reputation by launching a shitcoin” and rugging it. Despite the user’s initial suspicion, several users fell into the meticulously planned scam. As a community member pointed out, the graphics for the posts, and the posts themselves, were “pretty well done.” The attackers also assured users that METAL was not a scam and the band was “in it for the long haul.” The hacker also claimed that the crypto payment company MoonPay was collaborating with the band. However, the company quickly denied their involvement, stating that the responsible for the hack was not the master of puppets but the “master of scams.” As an X user pointed out, the Solana-based token’s market capitalization surpassed $2 million. However, it quickly plummeted after the band recovered access to the X account and deleted the promotional posts. Related Reading: Fact Or Fantasy?

The “lucky” investor bought the tokens at a $50,000 market cap and sold at the high of the scam. As of this writing, the token is trading at $0.00002031, a 99.3% decrease from its highest price of $0.003353. Furthermore, METAL’s market cap is $20,000, representing a 9000% drop.
