42398486,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTcKR,1436471776,"Secretive Hacking Group Targeted Bitcoin Firms, Research Shows","A secretive hacking group known as Wild Neutron has targeted a range of businesses worldwide including bitcoin companies, two top cybersecurity firms have reported.  Twin studies published by Kapersky Lab and Symantec state that the group, alternatively known as Morpho or Jripbot, has been involved in a number of high-profile attacks on companies like Apple, Google and Facebook, among many others.  While no specific firms were named, Kapersky released an infographic including bitcoin companies among a list of businesses targeted by the shadowy group.  The group, which the security firms suggest is not backed by any particular nation-state and appears to be focused on stealing corporate secrets, has also targeted jihadist forums, spyware developers and firms involved in finance, mergers and acquisitions and information technology.  Research director Costin Raiu said in a statement:  “Wild Neutron is a skilled and quite versatile group. Active since 2011, it has been using at least one zero-day exploit, custom malware and tools for Windows and OS X. Even though in the past it has attacked some of the most prominent companies in the world, it has managed to keep a relatively low profile via solid operational security which has so far eluded most attribution efforts.""  The group first emerged in 2013, and according to Symantec's research, has targeted firms based primarily in the US, Canada and Europe. Kapersky reported that, as of now, the origin of Wild Neutron ""remains a mystery"".

42398484,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTcGV,1436466312,Bitcoin Businesses Push for Relaxed Startup Rules in California,"A group of bitcoin businesses have drafted a letter to members of California's Senate Banking and Financial Institutions Committee following the state's most recent update of its proposed regulation for bitcoin and digital currencies.  Signed by BitGo, Bitnet, Blockstream, Chain, Gem, Mirror and Xapo, the letter praises the Senate for its most recent changes to AB 1326, particularly its elimination of certain redundant licensing and modification of its definition of ""virtual currency business"".  Perhaps most notably, however, the startups called on California to go a step further before the regulation is ultimately passed by updating certain language and removing additional burdens from early-stage industry startups.  The text reads:  ""We appreciate the addition of the provisional license and would like to continue to work with you on ways to expand it and grow the ability of small startups to innovate and flourish. As California is the home of many major tech companies started in a garage, our hope is to enable the next generation of entrepreneurs.""  The companies did not provide any additional clarity on specific changes they would like to see made to the provisions. Legislators had earlier updated the law to allow businesses with less than $1m in obligations to register with only a $500 licensing fee.  The firms also called for additional clarification to language meant to deal specifically with multi-signature wallet technology, whereby the control of funds in a bitcoin wallet can be shared by multiple parties.  ""We strongly support the current use of 'full' to modify custody and control, and we seek clarification such that the definition of 'full custody' or 'control' is limited to unilateral uses,"" the authors wrote.  The letter ended on a more wide-reaching note, suggesting that California would be wise to communicate with the tech community as it works to bring new jobs and opportunities to state residents and job seekers.

42398471,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTc5g,1436457627,Bitcoin's Best Funded Miner BitFury Raises Another $20 Million,"BitFury, the best capitalised mining firm in bitcoin, today announced it has raised an additional $20m in funding.  The raise, its third in two years, brings the company's total to $60m, double that of rival KnCMiner ($29m) and over half of the total investment in mining infrastructure to date ($116.5m).  In a statement, CEO Valery Vavilov said:  ""Today, we are excited to announce we have secured a funding round of $20m. The success of yet another funding round validates our business strategy and brings us closer to our ambitious goals.""  The Georgian Co-Investment Fund  , which took part in the round alongside DRW Venture Capital and iTech Capital, backed BitFury's previous rounds in May and October of 2014 with investor Bill Tai.  The company declined to confirm if other investors participated in its third round when contacted by CoinDesk.  In a statement, BitFury said the funds will go towards ""accelerating growth"" following its acquisition of a new 100MW data centre in the Republic of Georgia and the roll out of its 28nm ASIC.  The company is also expected to release its first bitcoin mining light bulbs sometime this year.  Industrial processing  Since it was founded by Vavilov and Valery Nebesny in 2011, BitFury has witnessed rapid and dramatic change in the mining sector.  As bitcoin's low value has eaten into miners' profit margins, the hardware firm – which also offers hosting services – has doubled down on its core role as an industrial-scale transaction processor. ""The entire bitcoin ecosystem is our client,"" its site reads.  According to statistics from blogger Organ of Coti, BitFury recently tripled its market share, now processing more of bitcoin's blocks than all private 'block makers' put together.  In a statement on the raise, DRW Venture Capital's founder Don Wilson praised the companies efforts in this area:  ""DRW's investment in BitFury is an acknowledgment of the impressive work Valery Vavilov and the team has done to become a leader in the business of securing the blockchain.""  Fast and cool  In the transaction processing arms race, BitFury faces competition from KnCMiner, who recently unveiled plans for a 18,000-sq ft Arctic air-cooled mining facility that will run on Europe's cheapest electricity.  Rather than sub-zero air, BitFury's new facility will keep its ""high performance"" 28nm chips at a stable temperature using immersion cooling technology from its subsidiary Allied Control.  Its current data centre, which The Georgian Co-Investment Fund helped develop, is located in Gori, in the east of Georgia. It has a third in Iceland.  In line with BitFury's ambition to double its performance-per-watt every six to 12 months, the facility is likely to house its 16nm ASIC, capable of 0.06 joules-per-gigahash, which is expected later this year.

42398491,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTcMP,1436450503,Visa: Bitcoin Has a Future in Payments,"Large existing payments companies are “lowering the drawbridges” and working more openly with new players in the space, according to a Visa executive.  Jonathan Vaux, executive director of new digital payments and strategy at Visa Europe, was speaking at WIRED Money, held in London yesterday.  “I genuinely believe that by working together, we will succeed together. I think that the innovation that the startups bring is fantastic and that the scale the incumbents – the banks, the Visas of the world – can bring is really really valuable,” he said.  Removing friction  Vaux’s session at the one-day conference focused on removing friction between startups and incumbents within the payments space.  Formerly vice president at American Express, Vaux said bitcoin is very much on his radar:  “The one thing I often get asked about is bitcoin. I do see … a separation between the currency and the technology that sits under it. From the point of view of currency, I think that's interesting. As Visa, that's what we do – we manage currencies.”  However, he finds the attitude of some of those in the cryptocurrency space a little bizarre. When he was at South by Southwest earlier this year, he noticed a number of cryptocurrency company members arguing.  He said it came across like a scene from Life of Brian, where fractious independence movements the People's Front of Judea and the Judean People's Front spend more time fighting each other than achieving their shared goal.  Regardless, he believes bitcoin has a future in the world of payments and wider finance.  “I think it's going to be really interesting how that currency stabilises,” he said, adding:  “Like any other currency, although this might not be the best week to discuss it, at Visa we are very keen to facilitate that translation of currencies on a global basis.”  The executive said he is also deeply interested in the underlying technology behind bitcoin and suggested it could be used to streamline the payments process when implemented by incumbents, such as Visa.  “Ultimately, what we're looking for is the technology and the component parts that we can bring into our platform and into our marketplace, that delivers a richer proposition,” he explained.  Startup advice  Vaux receives pitches on a daily basis from startups looking to form partnerships with Visa and he used his WIRED Money session to offer some advice to such companies.  Number one on his list was preparation. Startups need to “do their homework” and make sure they’re confident the service or product they are pitching is tailored to the larger company’s needs.  “Ok, you want my brand, you want my money, you want my distribution, what I have no sense of is what is in it for me as the provider of that service,” he said.  A lot of the startups Vaux comes into contact with are targeting their products at millennials, which doesn’t align with the target audiences of larger companies. He explained:  “Many of these services are so specifically focussed on the millennials that it may be hard [to gain a partnership] because, honestly, those are not going to be most large financial organisations' most successful customers.""  Another gripe Vaux has is startups pitching to him without having thought extensively enough about the future roadmap of their businesses.  “It is a large organisation's worst nightmare to be dependent on a partner who cannot fulfil the obligations from a financial or from a scalability standpoint. Therefore, there's a lot of nervousness about that and the more clear and well thought out the plan is, the better for everyone,” he explained.  Areas of interest  Vaux said some of the areas Visa is currently interested in include “identification, device fraud, using cloud-based technology to take some of the pain out of online payments, digital receipting”.  He said these are the kind of services Visa thinks will really add value for its current and future customers.  At the end of his session, when asked what he sees as the highest risk to the future of Visa, he replied “complacency”, concluding:  “I think that you have to adapt, you have to learn … I think what we have to focus on is where we add value and collaborate with others to do that.”  Images via Carsten Windhorst/WIRED.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/07/09/visa-bitcoin-has-a-future-in-payments,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8356bf8183772c2717d88ac2111e4ba47bc7d351-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The journalist, known for his work with Paul Vigna on The Age of Cryptocurrency and their regular WSJ column BitBeat – which covered developments in the crypto space – will take up his post at the beginning of September.  After 23 years in journalism, Casey's change of career is largely due to the transformative potential of digital currencies, he said in a statement.  ""Leaving the Wall Street Journal after 18 years is not a decision I took lightly. What it does reflect is my belief that digital currency is on the cusp of becoming a major transformative force in society.""  In his role as senior advisor, Casey will work with both students and professors on social impact projects, focusing on raising the profile of digital currencies.

42398481,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTcCZ,1436440259,Jersey Asks Public How it Should Regulate Bitcoin,"The Government of Jersey has opened a consultation period to seek public opinion on whether it should regulate virtual currencies such as bitcoin.  In its consultation paper, the British Crown dependency notes the risks associated with digital currencies and the various regulation options available.  Notably, the document also highlights the possibility of adopting distributed ledger technology – which, the authority says, is the key innovation of digital currencies.  Senator Philip Ozouf, the island's assistant chief minister, said in a statement:  ""Virtual currency systems represent a new and empowering technology. This consultation will allow us to take into account a wide range of views when putting in place an appropriate and proportionate regulatory environment.  He continued: ""This is about creating a modern digital economy that encourages innovation and the creation of jobs and growth whilst protecting Jersey from the unacceptable use of virtual currency.""  The consultation period will close on 7th August.  Local industry approval  Digital Jersey, a community and independent industry body involved in the preparation of the consultation, welcomed the government's dialogue.  Noting the significance of financial services for the island, the organisation said in a statement:  ""As a global finance centre, it is important for Jersey to take a thorough and considered look at both the opportunities and the challenges that virtual currencies offer.""  The consultation, it said, would aid collaborative efforts between the government, the finance and digital sectors and regulators.  Following the lead  The Jersey government's announcement follows the lead of the UK Treasury, which announced the government's plans to apply anti-money laundering (AML) laws to virtual currency exchanges earlier this year.  Following this, the Isle of Man established that bitcoin businesses operating from the island would have to comply with its anti-money laundering (AML) laws.

42398492,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTcLQ,1436423456,New Tool Lets Bitcoin Firms 'Ring Fence' Customer Funds,"Two London-based bitcoin startups have unveiled a new system that ""ring-fences"" customer funds from other operations.  As part of the set up, derivatives trading platform Crypto Facilities will continue to match buyers and sellers, but its partner, Elliptic, will take custody of the platform's funds at its cold storage vault.  Though common practice in capital markets, today's announcement is the first of its kind for the bitcoin space, where exchanges have lost millions to hackers targeting funds in their centralised wallets, or by simply not holding them at all.  In a statement, Crypto Facilities CEO Timo Schlaefer described the move as a ""watershed moment"" for bitcoin trading, adding:  ""Experienced market participants will immediately recognise that we have done away with one of the biggest risk factors in the bitcoin ecosystem.""  Meanwhile, Elliptic's CEO James Smith said a segregated settlement system such as this was an ""essential step"" toward companies performing bitcoin trading on a larger scale.  ""With Crypto Facilities' strong and robust trading infrastructure, we expect trade in bitcoin derivatives will flourish, improving bitcoin’s price stability and driving enterprise adoption,"" he added.  Blockchain settlement  To use one of Elliptic's ""ring fenced"" accounts, Crypto Facilities customers will be charged an annual fee – 0.75% of their account value.  Alternatively, they can stick with the default offline storage the firm offers at no additional cost.  Each day, after Crypto Facilities' accounts are settled at 5pm (UTC) to reflect their trading movements in the last 24 hours, Elliptic will settle these balances in its accounts via an API.  Using the wallet addresses Elliptic provides, users will be able to cross-reference their daily account balance with bitcoin's blockchain.  It's the kind of simple real-time auditing that bitcoin's public ledger makes possible, without getting stuck in Merkle Trees and external reports – which often only provide a snapshot of an exchange's reserves at one moment in time.  The bitcoins themselves are held in Elliptic's cold storage vaults, which are fully insured. At its launch in early 2014, the vault was the first of its kind to insure bitcoin assets. Other key players in the bitcoin ecosystem, including Circle and Coinbase, have since followed suit.
