42431110,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMzoLh,1570834855,tZERO-Backed Startup Seeks SEC Approval to Launch Security Token Market,"A firm part-owned by Overstock’s tZERO is seeking regulatory approval to launch one of the first markets for publicly traded, registered security tokens.  The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Friday released a rule change proposal that would allow Boston Securities and Token Exchange (BSTX) to create an automated equity trading platform, with ownership records stored on the ethereum blockchain.  Unlike its 50 percent shareholder tZERO, whose own trading platform went live in January and handles security tokens exempt from SEC registration requirements, BSTX would list only tokens that are full-fledged public securities. (The other owner is BOX Digital Markets LLC.)  The SEC’s 129-page rule change proposal released Friday gives an inside look at how the proposed exchange might one day run.  The exchange would back up its ownership records on the ethereum blockchain, updating the logbook at the end of each trading day. This would be additional to the market participants’ official ownership records.  Wallet managers, those in control of approved wallet addresses, would have to foot the daily gas bill to send their transactions to the ethereum blockchain – though the exchange doubts that these fees would add up to much.  Whitelisted addresses  The exchange’s listed tokens would also have to be compliant with the ERC-20 standard – with additional security measures in the protocol outlined by three different smart contracts to track ownership, whitelisted addresses and compliance with regulations.  As with NYSE and NASDAQ, the two central stock exchanges of Wall Street, BSTX proposes to only operate during market hours between 9:30 am and 4:00 pm eastern. TZERO had already stuck to these market hours.  The proposed rules for the BSTX platform resemble digital iterations of regulations and rules already in place on traditional exchanges.  One question addresses how to know who is conducting trades and whether they are allowed to. Traditional markets solve this with a participant ID (MPID) assigned by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), a self-regulatory organization (SRO). In the case of BSTX, individuals trading on the platform would use a whitelisted wallet address as their identifier.  Any tokens listed on the platform must have a minimum value of $0.01, according to the filing.

The SEC announced late Friday that it filed for and received an emergency action and restraining order halting Telegram from selling or otherwise distributing its gram tokens within the U.S. The network was supposed to go live on Oct. 31.  Telegram sold 2.9 billion gram tokens ""at discounted prices to 171 initial purchasers worldwide,"" the release said. This included more than 1 billion grams sold to U.S. investors. However, the complaint alleges that Telegram did not register its offer or sale.  SEC Division of Enforcement co-director Stephanie Avakian said in a statement that the emergency action is ""intended to prevent Telegram from flooding the U.S. markets with digital tokens that we allege were unlawfully sold.""  Telegram failed to provide its investors with information about the gram token and Telegram's own operations, she said.  Fellow co-director Steven Peikin added:  ""We have repeatedly stated that issuers cannot avoid the federal securities laws just by labeling their product a cryptocurrency or a digital token. Telegram seeks to obtain the benefits of a public offering without complying with the long-established disclosure responsibilities designed to protect the investing public.""  Long-term project  Telegram has been developing its TON blockchain project for well over a year, with rumors of its initial coin offering circulating in January 2018. Sources familiar with the project later told CoinDesk that the messaging platform was looking to raise up to $600 million in a pre-sale and another $700 million through a public offering.  Ultimately, Telegram claimed to raise $1.7 billion in a Form D disclosure filed with the SEC in March 2018.  The company has been secretive about its development work, only publishing code for the network last month. Telegram did not even publicly confirm it was working on TON until this month, after it first emailed investors to confirm its late-October launch and then updated its terms and conditions.  Despite the fact that the gram token is not yet live, a secondary market for the cryptocurrency has already exploded, with small crypto exchanges and OTC desks trading promises for tokens once they are issued.  Crypto exchange Coinbase has also announced custody support for gram tokens once they are issued.  The SEC's emergency action Friday comes days after it settled with Block.One, the company behind the EOSIO project and EOS token. While Block.One raised $4 billion, the SEC only secured a $24 million fine, and will not require Block.One to register EOS as a security.  Telegram could not immediately be reached for comment.

A proposed ban would envelop regulated exchanges and CCPs who operate under stringent regulations to provide pre- and post-trade risk management standards that are designed tot foster safe and efficient markets, the group said.  The London-based organization includes major regulated trading platforms for crypto futures and options, including CBOE, CME Group and national exchanges.  WFE's comment comes in response to a FCA’s consultation paper stating “retail consumers can not reliably the value and risks of crypto derivatives and exchange-traded products.”  The draft paper came out in July and its final version, which may result in a ban on derivatives trading for retail investors, will be announced in 2020.  In the document, the FCA said retail consumers are not ready to trade derivatives, such as futures and options on crypto exchanges, due to market abuse, financial crime, extreme volatility and a lack of understanding in the new asset class.  WFE CEO Nandini Sukumar said: “We ask that authorities, including the FCA, chart the right regulatory course to allow the market to flourish and benefit its consumers even as we understand that it’s a balancing act.”  However, Sukumar said that the WFE did support the regulator’s desire to better protect vulnerable consumers.  FCA’s ban draws a stark contrast with the U.S. financial watchdog’s response to crypto derivative trading.

The Libra Association is scheduled to have its first official meeting next week, where the remaining 23 members – which include both Facebook and its subsidiary Calibra – are supposed to sign the group's charter. A Facebook spokesperson confirmed Friday that the meeting is still taking place as planned.  While the original 28 members of the Libra Association were revealed with the cryptocurrency project's initial announcement, the members only signed non-binding letters of intent.  Non-profits Kiva and Mercy Corps, venture firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), crypto custodian Anchorage, Bison Trails and wallet provider Xapo all confirmed to CoinDesk Friday their intent to stay in the Libra Association.  Regulatory pushback  Facebook unveiled its vision for Libra in June 2019, announcing an ambitious project aimed at providing banking services to more than 1 billion individuals who currently lack access.  However, the project saw immediate pushback from lawmakers worldwide, with German and French officials vowing to block its launch and U.S. Representative Maxine Waters calling for a moratorium on development until the project's regulatory hurdles are cleared.  Most recently, U.S. Senators Brian Schatz and Sherrod Brown wrote identical letters to Stripe, Visa and Mastercard, warning of the ""chilling"" effects Libra could have on the global financial system and hinting that participation in the project may result in increased regulatory scrutiny of their own businesses.  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is scheduled to testify before the House Financial Services Committee, which Rep. Waters chairs, later this month.

42403339,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfnjc,1570822257,Chinese Banking Giant CCB Expands Blockchain Platform as Volume Breaks $53 Billion,"China Construction Bank, one of the largest Chinese commercial banks, has expanded its trade finance blockchain platform with new abilities, including cross-chain and inter-bank transactions, as trading volume surpasses $53 billion.  Speaking in Beijing at the official launch of the upgraded platform BCTrade2.0, CCB vice president Ji Zhihong said the new platform will leverage blockchain technology to provide better financial services for Chinese exporters, according to a Chinese media report.  Launched in April 2018, the platform has to-date processed over $53.5 billion transactions between exporters, banks and non-bank financial institutions, he said.  The platform offers factoring and forfaiting services that enable exporters to get immediate cash by selling their medium and long-term receivables at a discount price.  The new feature's cross-chain function will allow the bank’s 54 domestic and international branches to process transactions with each other, as well as another 40 banking institutions, including both state-owned and foreign banks, commercial banks and non-bank platforms.  The bank has appointed its subsidiary Jianxin Financial Services, capitalized with $230 million, to operate and maintain the new platform. The Shanghai-based fintech firm was founded last April by the bank’s affiliates, according to the State Administration for Industry and Commerce.  The launch is the bank’s latest effort to increase the efficiency of its banking system for export trade financing with blockchain technology. It completed the debut blockchain-based trading via a factoring transaction in January 2018, according to a statement from the company.  “The move is in line with China’s economic plan to promote trade amid the One Belt One Road Initiative and help grow the real economy in the country,” the bank said in the statement.  All four major state-owned commercial banks in China - CCB, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Bank of China, and Agricultural Bank of China - have launched blockchain-based financial services initiatives in the past two years.  ICBC, the largest bank in the world by assets, has used its online blockchain financing platform to help small and medium companies with factoring transactions. The bank gathered 1,300 users with $6.4 billion transactions in the first nine months since its launch last February, according to a statement from the bank.  Bank of China processed its first international money transfer to South Korea in dollars via its patented blockchain payment system last August, while Agricultural Bank of China helped farmers with online trading by using its e-commerce blockchain financing system in August, 2017.  China’s central bank started to run the Bay Area Trade Finance Blockchain Platform last September to help small and medium companies to finance in the areas between Hong Kong, Macau and Guangdong province in southern China.

42403354,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfnyN,1570820453,Identity Thief Spends $5 Million on Cloud Computing to Mine Cryptocurrency,"Singaporean citizen Ho Jun Jia, 29, also known as Matthew Ho, was indicted for stealing over $5 million worth of cloud computing services to mine cryptocurrencies, according to a grand jury indictment from the U.S. District Court in Seattle, Washington.  Ho was arrested in Singapore and is being charged with wire fraud, access device fraud, aggravated identity theft.  The indictment alleges that Ho opened multiple accounts in cloud services providers, including Amazon Web Services (AWS), with at least three stolen identities and credit cards. He then used the cloud computing power to mine several cryptocurrencies including bitcoin and ethereum from October, 2017 to February, 2018, becoming one of the largest data users in terms of volume during the time.  With the stolen personal information, Ho subsequently posed as a prominent California video-game developer, a Texas resident and an Indian tech firm founder. He tricked cloud computing providers to approve heightened account privileges, increased computer processing power and storage and deferred billing.  The $5 million financial loss largely comes from unpaid cloud service bills that supported Ho’s mining operation, while some were actually paid by the California game developer’s financial staff before the fraud was detected.  Beside using the developer’s identity to open accounts in AWS, Ho also purchased cloud computing power for Google Cloud Services with the other two victims’ identities.  According to the indictment, the defendant converted the cryptocurrencies into traditional funds via several trading websites.  The court did not disclose the real identity of the three victims nor the amount of money Ho made from selling the cryptocurrencies.  Wire fraud is punishable by up to 20 years in prison, while access device fraud and aggravated identity theft are punishable by up to ten years and two years in prison respectively, according to the court.

The pilot announced Friday involves Alfa-Bank and Novolipetsk Steel Company (NLMK) on the Russian side and Commerzbank plus metals engineering firm Vesuvius GmbH in Germany.  Marco Polo, a joint undertaking between technology firms TradeIX and R3, has a grand vision of global blockchain-based trade finance replacing paper and trust with shared, instant digital verification.  The array of banks on Marco Polo reflect this global aspiration: Bank of America, BNP Paribas, Commerzbank, ING, LBBW, Anglo-Gulf Trade Bank, Standard Chartered Bank, Natixis, Bangkok Bank, SMBC, Danske Bank, NatWest, DNB, OP Financial Group, Alfa-Bank, Bradesco, BayernLB, Helaba, S-Servicepartner, Raiffeisen Bank International, Standard Bank, Credit Agricole and National Bank of Fujairah.  The teams involved in the Russia-Germany pilot are by no means enterprise blockchain neophytes.  “We launched our first distributed ledger technology in trade finance as early as 2017. Since then, corporate blockchain solutions have been considerably elaborated, and earned our clients’ confidence and proved their applicability to real business processes,” said Dina Merkulova, head of trade finance at Alfa-Bank.

Previously, the 22-bank blockchain consortium added the capability for a third party in a trade (a logistics provider, for example) to trigger a payment to a supplier at the moment goods are shipped. This milestone work also involved Commerzbank with LBBW shepherding a trade between engineering technology firm Voith and KSB SE.  Enno-Burghard Weitzel, Commerzbank’s global head of trade finance products, said in a statement:  “Our international corporates show continuous interest in piloting the Marco Polo Payment Commitment together with us and banks of our global network, like Alfa-Bank. Marco Polo network, meets our customers’ growing demand for increased speed of transaction and transparency, optimized financing, enhanced working capital management and possible integration of ERP systems.”  At the recent Sibos conference in London, representatives from Marco Polo and we.trade shared a panel.

42403342,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfnnY,1570815323,Facebook's Calibra Sued by Mobile Banking App Over Similar Logos,"Facebook’s Calibra is being sued for trademark infringement by mobile banking app Current, adding a potential legal showdown to the beleaguered Libra digital currency project’s growing list of woes.  The complaint  , filed Thursday in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that the Calibra logo is too similar to Current’s own, which the fintech firm has been using since August 2016. Calibra is developing the Libra project’s digital wallet.  Current is seeking a preliminary injunction and monetary damages. It alleges:  “The infringing mark adopted and used by the Calibra Defendants is not only confusingly similar to, but virtually identical to the Current Marks.”  Current is an alternative, app-based banking platform that in many respects shares Libra’s goal of opening up financial services to the masses. But while Current’s solution exists within the realms of traditional banking, Libra’s sprawling vision of a digital currency-powered future is far more radical.  As it happens, the logo designs have almost identical origin stories – both were created by San Francisco-based branding firm Character, a named defendant in the suit. It was unknown if the same Character team members worked on the accounts, as Character did not respond to requests for comment.  “It is suspicious that the defendant’s logo came out of the same firm that created the plaintiff's logo,” Howard Shire, a partner in the intellectual property department of Pepper Hamilton LLP, told CoinDesk.  But Shire, speaking only as an observer, said there could be an explanation for that, perhaps in the contracts or communications passed between firms. Those answers could likely come during pre-trial discovery - though a trial is unlikely, given that Shire says 98 percent of civil cases are settled beforehand.  Current filed an application for its logo on June 26, 2019, eight days after Facebook unveiled the Libra project and branding.  It claims exclusive use for “Downloadable software for enabling the electronic transfer of money between users” among other mobile banking-related uses, the application filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office shows.

42403351,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfntS,1570813897,"SEC, CFTC, FinCEN Warn Crypto Industry to Follow US Banking Laws","The heads of three U.S. financial regulators warned the cryptocurrency industry to abide by banking laws in a joint statement published Friday.  The statement, signed by Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman Heath Tarbert, Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) Director Kenneth Blanco and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Jay Clayton, ""reminds"" actors in the crypto space that they must comply with various banking and financial services laws in the U.S., regardless of what they call their cryptocurrencies or tokens.  The agencies referred to the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), which outlines how different financial services businesses should register with regulators.  Specifically, the agencies explained that the ""nature of the digital asset-related activities"" a person participates in will determine which agencies that person should register with, as well as which other laws they need to comply with.  ""For example, something referred to as an 'exchange' in a market for digital assets may or may not also qualify as an 'exchange' as that term is used under the federal securities laws,"" the statement reads, adding:  ""As such, regardless of the label or terminology that market participants may use, or the level or type of technology employed, it is the facts and circumstances underlying an asset, activity or service, including its economic reality and use (whether intended or organically developed or repurposed), that determines the general categorization of an asset, the specific regulatory treatment of the activity involving the asset, and whether the persons involved are 'financial institutions' for purposes of the BSA.""  Blanco, Tarbert and Clayton defined the scope of their agencies with regard to cryptocurrencies and service providers in additional comments published with the joint statement, addressing futures commission merchants, introducing brokers, exchanges, broker-dealers and mutual funds, as some examples. Each of the agency directors went as far as to describe which types of companies their regulatory bodies oversee.  In his comments, Blanco seemingly applied the BSA to virtual currency service providers, noting that his agency published interpretive guidance in May to address ""money transmission denominated in value that substitutes for currency,"" including cryptocurrencies.  ""As set forth in the 2019 CVC Guidance, a number of digital asset-related activities qualify a person as an MSB [money services business] that would be regulated by FinCEN,"" he said. ""FinCEN’s BSA regulations also provide that any person 'registered with, and functionally regulated or examined by, the SEC or the CFTC,' would not be subject to the BSA obligations applicable to MSBs, but instead would be subject to the BSA obligations of such a type of regulated entity.""  Clayton said his agency's mandate is to protect investors, ensure fair markets and aid capital formation, which generally oversees the securities space, but added that the BSA does provide the SEC with some other requirements.  ""Broker-dealers and mutual funds are required to implement reasonably-designed AML Programs and report suspicious activity. These rules are not limited in their application to activities involving digital assets that are 'securities' under the federal securities laws,"" he said.

Following the release earlier this week of the IRS's long-awaited guidance for reporting crypto-related income, the IRS on Friday circulated a draft of the new Form 1040, Schedule 1, Additional Income and Adjustments to Income. The draft was shared in an email to tax software companies, which the agency also shared with journalists.  The sheet, prefaced by a warning that it's only a draft and not an actual document for filing taxes, asks at the top:  ""At any time during 2019, did you receive, sell, send, exchange, or otherwise acquire any financial interest in any virtual currency?""

Taxpayers do not need to file Schedule 1 if their answer to this question is NO and they do not have to file Schedule 1 for any other purpose,"" the IRS said.  The IRS asked its software partners to send comments on the new form in the next 30 days.  The guidance released this week was the agency's second-ever given on virtual currencies, following five years of silence on the matter.

42403356,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfnuR,1570811716,"At Devcon, Bitcoin Developer Amir Taaki Foresees a 'DarkTech Renaissance'","Nobody in the cryptocurrency space is thinking big enough.  That was the message from bitcoin developer and former Kurdish YPG militia member Amir Taaki at Devcon 5, the annual ethereum developer conference hosted this year in Osaka, Japan.  “I hear people talking about decentralized derivatives and mortgages,” Taaki said to an enraptured audience of hundreds on Friday. “Why are we not thinking about how to create dark finance tools we can leverage against government bonds?”  “We can crash national economies,” he said, adding:  “You see the crypto nouveau riche buying yachts and lambos [but] no one is thinking about what we can do on a big scale.”  For Taaki, who spent 2015 to 2018 in war-torn Syria fighting terrorist group ISIS, deploying cryptocurrencies on a national and even international scale has been top of mind.  “[In Syria,] I was in charge of technology projects for a region of about 5 million people. This was a great opportunity to deploy crypto on a massive scale … but most people weren’t interested,” Taaki said.  Taaki recounted approaching both ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin and Parity Technologies founder Gavin Wood for financial support.  Buterin’s response to Taaki’s ask of a $25,000 donation for training new cryptocurrency developers was ambiguous, according to Taaki. Taaki said Wood suggested he apply for funding through an official grants program.  Viewing the grants process as cumbersome and “bureaucratic,” Taaki seemed to take personal offense at the responses and called out the two on the Devcon stage for having “low social intelligence.”  Both Buterin and Wood were contacted to confirm this story though neither has responded as of press time. We will update the piece if we hear back.  “It’s hard to get donations from people to support something that’s strategically important to cryptocurrencies as a whole,” Taaki said, adding:  “It’s a problem that everything now is built off of personality and celebrity culture. … This is going to destroy our effectiveness as a movement.”  Moving beyond the tech  Taaki’s words resonated with many at the conference.  “I think he tries to keep the dream real,” said Santiago Siri, founder of Democracy Earth, a Y Combinator-backed nonprofit building digital governance technology. “I’m legitimately inspired by the values he stands for in this industry.”  Echoing that sentiment, Ann Brody, a Ph.D. student studying ethereum at McGill University tweeted:  “We need philosophical education to build a new system to serve the greater good via blockchain. We need to reinvent the hacker image. Thank you Amir.”  To Siri, the biggest takeaway from Taaki’s talk was the need to refocus on “how to become a superpower.” That is, how to advance cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology into becoming a force worth reckoning with.  “It can really be a rival to the internet in our civilization,” Siri told CoinDesk in an interview following Taaki’s talk. “It’s clearly not just a cultural change. It can also be a profound institutional change to our political order.”  New leaders  But to do this, the industry needs to embrace its political side, according to Siri, and think more globally.  Siri highlighted initiatives such as the recently announced 1 Million Devs project as a welcome step in the right direction.  Announced at Devcon by ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin (who also heads ethereum venture studio ConsenSys), the 1 Million Devs project seeks to educate traditional web developers about the promise of blockchain technology.  Education, Taaki agrees, is key.  “It can’t just be education about the technology. It also has to also be a philosophical education,” Taaki said, adding:  “There needs to be a change on a big scale for cryptocurrency to realize its big potential. … We have to train not just hackers, but leaders.”  Amir Taaki speaks at Devcon 5, image by Christine Kim for CoinDesk",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | TECHNOLOGY,Christine Kim,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/10/11/at-devcon-bitcoin-developer-amir-taaki-foresees-a-darktech-renaissance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/570c42359d77dde679d27a63b54a88d34de34845-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Blockchain Education Alliance will address crypto recruiters’ perennial high-demand-and-low-supply quandary with a raft of tools, resources, mentorships and industry contacts that it hopes will create a new generation of students in the field.  “It’s better for everyone in the ecosystem if we have more talent and better projects being built,” said coordinator Ashlie Meredith, the program director for Mousebelt University, adding:  “It’s a long-term investment in the space that benefits everyone.”  Launched by Bay Area incubator Mousebelt, the Blockchain Education Alliance includes Stellar, Hedera, ICON, Ontology, Wanchain, Harmony One, Nervos, Orbs, LTO Network, Emurgo, NEM, TRON and ETC Labs. Mousbelt hopes that more will join.  The organization will work directly with students and the blockchain clubs that Meredith said have been at the forefront of university-level engagement.  Part of the help will come through funding. In the past, Mousebelt has supported student events, hackathons. and given directly to engineering schools. Its donation to the University of California, Los Angeles, led to the creation of UCLA’s first accredited blockchain engineering course.  Over time, alliance members hope to further build out academic curricula, increasing blockchain education presence via accredited courses. That could be a big help, according to students.  “I think universities are a little bit lost in the space, and having industry help them find out what they need” can be valuable for them, Zach Nelson, a Mousebelt campus ambassador and founder of the University of Washington’s 800-member blockchain club, told CoinDesk.  Nelson said the space is full of “fragmented knowledge” and that a wide network of partnerships could go far in bringing up a stronger crypto community.  Gili Ovadia, head of global business development for the Israeli blockchain platform Orbs, an alliance member, told CoinDesk that his firm could give students hands-on support and research funding.  He said the firm joined the alliance because of its sprawling network: nearly 70 universities and industry players are members at the start.

42403355,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfnxO,1570803544,'Members' of OpenLibra Disavow Project Days After Its Devcon Unveiling,"The creator of an “open” alternative to Facebook’s Libra stablecoin initially misrepresented which organizations are involved in the project, CoinDesk has learned.  Four individuals and organizations have disavowed the OpenLibra project, which was unveiled Oct. 9 at Devcon. Others say the extent of their involvement was overblown.  “I showed up to one community call for OpenLibra. I didn’t really do anything after that,” said Sunny Aggarwal, a core developer at blockchain startup Tendermint Inc.  He added:  “I wasn’t asked before my name was used on the slides.”  Outside of Aggarwal, representatives from Chainlink, Web3 Foundation and Hashed have told CoinDesk their names were used without their permission on the OpenLibra slide deck presented at Devcon. The OpenLibra project aims to ensure that access to the Libra stablecoin and its technology remains free from corporate control.  In the case of Web3 Foundation and Hashed, the companies say their names were mistakenly associated with those of employees who no longer work there.  “We’re not opposed to OpenLibra. We’re just not a part of it,” said Zeke Turner, the Web3 Foundation’s head of communications.  Lucas Geiger, the founder of the OpenLibra project, has since apologized for the oversight.  In a Telegram message to Chainlink CEO Sergey Nazorov and this reporter, Geiger said:  “We’ve been in a rush preparing materials, and my team took a list I had of partners and potential partners and put it on the site. It’s removed now. Apologies for the trouble that [this has] caused. I should have reviewed more closely.”  Geiger has not confirmed which of the 30 listed individuals and organizations announced on Wednesday were “potential partners” and which were actual confirmed partners of the OpenLibra project.  So far, CoinDesk has received direct confirmation from nine individuals affirming their involvement in the OpenLibra initiative.  They are: ethereum developer Lane Rettig, Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) Ph.D. student Barnabe Monnot, Democracy Earth founder Santi Siri, Tendermint director Zaki Manian, Iqlusion founder Tony Arcieri, Vulcanize founder Rick Dudley, BlockScience founder Michael Zargham, SUTD professor Georgios Piliouras and HiveOnline founder Sofie Blakstad.  Each said they are contributing individually to the OpenLibra project for now, without specifying whether their affiliated organizations would contribute in the future.  Blakstad emphasized that her involvement in OpenLibra was primarily ideological.  “I can confirm that I am giving my support to the OpenLibra project, although we are not directly engaged with building the technology,” Blakstad said in an email to CoinDesk. “My support for OpenLibra is a personal choice driven by my very strong convictions.”  As for Vulcanize’s Rick Dudley, OpenLibra is a project he may or may not continue to work closely with due to “complex conflicts of interest.”  Regardless, Dudley told CoinDesk that having his name featured on the OpenLibra site without his express permission was not all that surprising.  “It happens all the time in the blockchain space,” Dudley said.  The OpenLibra site has since taken down all the names of its “contributors” and updated the website.  “The OpenLibra project is a loose collective of individuals,” the updated website says:  “We are individuals from some of the best-in-class blockchain projects and non-profit foundations, working on a crypto-native solution regarding Libra.”  Lucas Geiger image via Twitter",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | LINK | TECHNOLOGY,Christine Kim,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/10/11/members-of-openlibra-disavow-project-days-after-its-devcon-unveiling,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dfe13a5c95e65a51306e1f645b3cb5c996416dc8-2560x1486.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403341,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfnla,1570799821,Draper-Backed Startup Launches .Crypto Domains on Ethereum,"A startup building domains on blockchains has just launched a .crypto name registry on ethereum.  Unstoppable Domains – a firm backed in May to the tune of $4 million by Draper Associates and Boost VC – said Friday that the new .crypto extension can be connected to users' public cryptocurrency address, allowing third-parties to more easily send funds.  Doing away with long, complex crypto address (for example, a bitcoin address will look something like ""1BvBMSEYstWetqTFn5Au4m4GFg7xJaNVN2"") in favor of a more memorable and less mistake-prone domain will ""simplify cryptocurrency payments and lead to mainstream adoption,"" Unstoppable Domains claimed.  The firms indicated it's already seen a high level of interest in its first domain extension, .zil, with over 100,000 having been sold.  The original service was built on the Zilliqa blockchain (hence the .zil domain) and the website content was stored on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) or other decentralized storage networks, the company said at the time.  While the new registry is built on ethereum, it isn't restricted to payments in ether.  Co-founder and CEO Matthew Gould commented:  “We believe that tribalism in the crypto community is slowing down adoption of the technology. .Crypto is a domain name system meant to be used for any cryptocurrency payment and with any cryptocurrency wallet. Sending money to a .crypto domain is a way simpler user experience for the millions of cryptocurrency users that currently have to copy/paste and type in long addresses in order to transact.”  The firm's blockchain domains can also be used to provide ""uncensorable"" websites, it says on its website. Linking the domain to content on a decentralized storage network results in pages that ""no one"" can take down.  Using an immutable blockchain for web domains can have its downside, however.  As reported last week, a hacker exploited a bug in an auction run by OpenSea for the Ethereum Naming Service (ENS) resulting in a number of top level names – including apple.eth, defi.eth, wallet.eth, and pay.eth. – being nabbed with no way to retrieve them.  After OpenSea appealed to the hacker and offered a reward, the domains were handed back.

42403361,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfo2J,1570795202,Is Bitcoin a Safe Haven Like Gold? These Four Charts Say Not Yet,"Galen Moore is a member of the CoinDesk Research team. The following article originally appeared in Institutional Crypto by CoinDesk, a weekly newsletter focused on institutional investment in crypto assets. Sign up for free here.      Investors are beginning to have a clear sense why bitcoin exists: it's digital gold, a narrative that has emerged clearly as other assets flounder, gasping for air in the muddy water of shallow memes.  Ethereum has hopped from story to disjointed story; now it's ""money"" (OK). Nobody knows what Ripple, er, XRP is.  If bitcoin is digital gold, then it must be a haven in times of crisis – a ""risk-off"" asset. Any thoughts of bitcoin being a safe haven have been put to bed in the past 10 days and can be found there thrashing in their own clammy sweat, racked by fever-nightmares of 2018.  The question is, can bitcoin become a safe haven? We may be about to find out. Born during the last global financial crisis, bitcoin has yet to see one. In the CoinDesk Research white paper, ""Is Bitcoin a Safe Haven?"" we look at some of the theories around how bitcoin might perform during a macroeconomic crisis and present a few metrics that might be used to measure bitcoin's response. You can download the paper here. This article will present an up-to-date look at a few of those metrics.  Bitcoin vs. gold  Some people you run into may show you a bitcoin chart next to a gold chart and point out similarities in their shape. Ignore it.  Bitcoin's price has never shown a correlation with gold, positive or negative, for any length of time, since early 2015. Over the long term, it's moved toward less correlation, not more.  A haven is in the eye of the beholder. Bitcoin may be a risk-on asset for venture investors in Silicon Valley, and a risk-off asset for people caught in a currency crisis. Bitcoin adoption in Venezuela is often cited to indicate the latter.  Bitcoin adoption in China may be another measure. China also has authoritarian currency controls and a wobbling economy; its population and total wealth are orders of magnitude greater than Venezuela’s. Thus, its potential impact on the bitcoin price is greater.  The past five years have seen several significant periods of strong correlation between USD-CNY and bitcoin. That is, when the yuan wavers in dollar terms, bitcoin's dollar price often tends to rise. This may be a positive indicator for those who hope that a yuan currency crisis could ignite safe-haven demand for bitcoin.  Bitcoin is the only crypto asset about which rational people could even discuss a haven narrative. Other crypto assets may be compelling, but they clearly represent risk-on bets against a vision of future adoption that may take years to prove. If bitcoin is becoming a ""risk-off"" asset, bitcoin returns ought to start decoupling from other crypto assets.  Hmmm, nope.  With both ethereum's ETH and Ripple's XRP, bitcoin returns are clearly establishing a stronger positive correlation over time. There is no decoupling here.  Conclusion and a note on the data  None of this is to say that bitcoin doesn't have a credible story as a safe haven asset. It's clear that it isn't one today, but that doesn't mean it might not become a risk-off asset during the next downturn, or the one after that. Even Jerome Powell understands this: bitcoin is a ""speculative store of value,"" he has said. Its investors are speculating that it will become a store of value.  It's difficult to pinpoint whether bitcoin is moving toward realizing that narrative, or not. Bitcoin's volatility and 24/7 trading frustrate any attempt to correlate its daily returns with those of other assets. For this blog post, we took a 30-day moving average of daily returns and measured the 90-day correlation over time. The results are mostly similar to the 30-day returns we used in the white paper, ""Is Bitcoin a Safe Haven?"" They also match the results we obtained using weekly returns. The data run from four years old or the earliest available, through the last market close on the morning of Monday, Sept. 30.  In the white paper, we also look at data from fiat onramps to bitcoin in emerging markets, as well as the behavior of long-term holders, tracked via time stamps of ownership records on the bitcoin blockchain.

42403362,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfo1K,1570791648,"Bitcoin Fails at Key Price Hurdle, Risks Return to $8,000","Bitcoin is facing further losses after the bulls failed to capitalize on price gains seen this week.  The cryptocurrency's quick pullback from a 2.5-week high of $8,830 to below $8,400 this morning has invalidated a bullish breakout on the 4-hour chart seen Wednesday, as seen below.  4-hour chart  The failure to hold above the 200-day moving average (MA) at $8,654 has also weakened the bullish outlook on the daily chart and may have shifted risk in favor of a drop to $8,000 in the next 24 hours.  Daily chart  Bitcoin crossed the 200-day MA in the Asian trading hours on Friday and jumped to highs above $8,800, as expected. The breakout was short-lived, however, and prices fell from $8,820 to $8,356 in the 60 minutes to 06:00 UTC.

The job openings, which appeared in recent months, are the first indicator that Bank of America plans to do much else with the technology apart from 78 blockchain-related patents the bank has filed or won to date.  The Charlotte, N.C.-based bank has six positions open that mention blockchain: one for a treasury product manager, three for enterprise payment technology senior architects and two for banking regulatory domain architects. Each job description either calls for experience with blockchain tech or the ability to apply it in a banking context.  A recently closed ad on LinkedIn also suggests the bank has plans to use Ripple's distributed ledger-based payments network in some form. The post for a treasury product manager indicates the role ""leads the product management team for the Ripple Project.""  The new hire would be responsible for ""driving product strategy and growth, overseeing daily product management routines, and overseeing the development of new initiatives that result in an innovative and highly-competitive product offering.""  Bank of America did not respond to requests for comment by press time.  The lender is also a member of the Marco Polo trade finance blockchain consortium, founded by startups R3 and Trade IX.  In March, the bank’s chief technology officer, Cathy Bessant, told CNBC that she’s bearish on the technology and that the patents exist only so that the bank can pivot to blockchain quickly if the need arises.  That pivot may be coming sooner rather than later. In an application filed in March 2018 and published by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) this month, the bank requested a patent for a permissioned blockchain to record internet-of-things (IoT) node data.

The Perth Mint Gold Token (PMGT) was launched by InfiniGold on Friday, and is backed 1:1 by GoldPass certificates issued by The Perth Mint. The digital certificates are 100% gold backed and guaranteed by the Government of Western Australia, which is the sole owner of the 120-year-old mint.  ""PMGT is digitized gold that allows users to conveniently acquire and have entitlement over government guaranteed physical gold stored at The Perth Mint in a trusted and cost-effective way,"" InfiniGold said in an announcement.  The token – designed with the assistance of professional services firm Ernst and Young – is aimed to offer an alternative to traditional gold investment products such as ETFs, while using blockchain tech to allow real-time trading and settlement.  InfiniGold CEO Andreas Ruf said:  “With The Perth Mint as custodian of the underlying physical gold that backs PMGT, buyers will be able to access a secure and reliable token representing the strongest asset class to date – gold.”  As far as the underlying tech goes, PMGT is a compatible with the ERC-20 standard behind by many ethereum-based tokens. InfiniGold is further touting the token as an alternative to U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins such as tether and USD Coin.  Perhaps taking aim at tether – the top stablecoin by market cap that's faced accusations that it manipulated the price of bitcoin and was not actually fully backed by USD – InfiniGold said PMGT's gold backing offers investors ""superior transparency, credit quality, risk diversification and hedging against market volatility.""  In interviews and press releases, project members have voiced concerns on crypto volatility. Perth Mint’s Hayes told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) in January 2018 that traders want another digital alternative to bitcoin, the original digital gold.  Hayes said to ABC:  ""If you use precious metals to back something on blockchain or something that is allied to blockchain, it retains its intrinsic value, unlike the offerings from Bitcoin and Ethereum, which really rely on everyone believing that there's something behind it.”  Now that the tokens Hayes alluded to are coming about, PMGT can make the most of Australia’s largest gold refinery, InfiniGold’s CEO Andreas Ruf told CoinDesk.  “The Perth Mint consistently delivers in excess of US$16bn worth of precious metal bars and coins per annum, providing us with plenty of supply for PMGT.""  The launch comes as haven assets like gold, and possibly bitcoin, are becoming more attractive to investors. Fears of a U.S. recession have seen gold prices bounce in recent weeks, and other companies are launching products to capitalize on the yellow metal's growing popularity.  Just yesterday, crypto liquidity and OTC provider B2C2 launched the first gold derivatives product that synthetically trades against bitcoin and is targeted at investors seeking safety from market uncertainty.  Between bitcoin-settled gold derivatives, tokens tied to the price of gold, competing gold-backed cryptocurrencies - and murmurs that Russia’s central bank is considering a gold-backed token of its own - the crypto markets are flooded with variants of digital gold.  But the project leads say there’s still a market for PMGT, in part because of its custodian’s reputation: the government of Western Australia has an AA1 rating from Moody’s.

42403358,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfo0L,1570780840,Why French Lender SocGen Issued a $110 Million Ethereum Bond to Itself,"Six months after Societe Generale issued its first bond on a public blockchain, it has yet to offer the instrument to clients or to make use of the full capabilities of the smart contract mediating the sale.  But the French financial institution insists that it hasn’t forgotten about the €100 million (roughly $110 million) bond, which it sold to itself, and that it remains interested in trialing blockchain technology in the long term.  ""Our intention is to not resell this at this point in time,"" said Jean-Marc Stenger, CEO of SocGen subsidiary Forge Digital Capital Markets, one of many startups participating in an “intrapreneurial” program within the bank.  SocGen, which placed the covered bonds on ethereum back in April, is one of several established companies to experiment with issuing debt using the second-largest public blockchain by market cap.  In November 2018, BBVA recorded a $150 million syndicated loan on ethereum. And last month, Santander settled both sides of a $20 million bond transaction on ethereum, meaning it not only issued a token to represent debt but also settled the amount using other tokens representing cash.  While SocGen still owns the bond that it created, the lender will monitor whether ethereum’s smart contract can automate the typical functions of debt issuance.  “We are demonstrating that all the events of the bond are written in the smart contract and that all the events are managed by it,” Stenger said. “We’ll see if this technology becomes the future.”  By “events,” Steger means that the smart contract manages the parameters of the issuance, including a mechanism to extend the bond’s maturity, an option for the issuer to call the security back if needed, and an automated calculation of the semi-annual coupon paid to the bondholder.  Next steps  Next on Stenger’s list of experiments is to offer a blockchain-based bond to external investors and to tokenize other financial instruments, including different types of bonds.  Unlike Santander, Societe Generale does not plan for now to settle both sides of a transaction on-chain. Stenger envisages using stablecoins or settlement coins issued by central banks for the purpose.  “Clients won’t shift overnight on digital cash,” Stenger said. “Mastering settlement of security tokens in fiat money is key during a potentially very long transition phase where clients will deal with both fiat and digital cash.”  According to EtherScan, a blockchain explorer site, around the time that SocGen announced the bond’s issuance there was a transfer from one address to a registered investor address held by the lender.  “The investor [SocGen] received the token a few seconds after the launch date,” Stenger said.  Registered investors wanting to buy a bond token must hold a wallet that is whitelisted, or previously vetted by the issuer to comply with regulations. INX Limited, a new crypto exchange planning a public offering of security tokens, is using a similar mechanism.  Out of gas  The 1,000 SocGen tokens sitting in the address, which are supposed to represent €100 million of bonds, can’t be subdivided or moved unless the bank adds more ether to the smart contract address, noted Stefan Loesch, partner at Lexbyte, a tokenization advisory firm.  This ether is the “gas” or the transaction fee involved with ethereum which is set by miners. The absence of ether in the smart contract’s address is another sign that the bank does not intend to sell the token to outside investors any time soon. Stenger said that the bank doesn’t need gas to redeem the bond.  Broadly, SocGen is picking its spots rather than trying to be a leader on all fronts of blockchain innovation, Stenger said.  “The intention is to leverage this technology to have a more efficient way of issuing and processing bonds going forward,” he said. “This transaction was the first one and we’ve seen other banks doing that same transaction since … We are still evolving what our position will be in this new environment, and we probably won’t do everything.”  Societe Generale image by Shutterstock.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/10/11/why-french-lender-socgen-issued-a-110-million-ethereum-bond-to-itself,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ff4ed369cb1e5ace699b89e1b0b0d48bcda2b150-1320x880.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Listed as XRP-BF2, the XRP variant is pegged one-to-one to XRP on Binance’s main exchange for instant swapping without slippage, the exchange said. Binance minteds 10 million XRP-BF2 for the DEX.  XRP-BF2 is preceded by a June 2019 addition of a pegged variant of bitcoin, BTCB.  “All XRP issued on Binance Chain will be backed 1:1 by native XRP sitting in a publicly disclosed address that can be monitored by anyone at all times,” Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) said in a statement. “With no trading involved, it is always 1:1, there is no spread, no slippage, no fees.”  The mechanism will soon spread to other cryptocurrencies as well, CZ continued:  “More significantly, this is not limited to XRP now. The same mechanism can be used to migrate other coins onto Binance Chain, where they can experience non-custodian trading that was not possible before.”  For now, the only road for off-boarding XRP-BF2 goes through Binance, although the firm is currently working toward adding swap channels through partner wallets.
