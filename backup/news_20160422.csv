42378668,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lIH3,1461362418,Bitcoin Price Breaks $450 as Global Markets Turn Positive,"Markets Weekly is a column analyzing price movements in the global digital currency markets, and the technology's use case as an asset class.  The price of bitcoin broke past $450 this week, as markets rallied in response to perceived progress surrounding the network's block capacity dilemma.  The price breakout, which took place as the digital currency surged more than 6% in the seven days through 12:00 UTC on 22nd April, ended the pattern of the last several weeks, when bitcoin fluctuated largely within a tight range.  ""Traders have been watching the psychological price barrier of $450 for a long time,"" Joe Lee, founder of bitcoin derivatives trading platform Magnr, told CoinDesk.  He added:  ""Now that was broken earlier in the week by every major exchange, eyes are on the bullish trend continuing with $480 and $500 as target prices for the three-to-six month timeframe.""  Volume still modest  Interestingly enough, bitcoin’s sharp rise took place amid more modest weekly trading volumes.  Market participants traded 12.96m BTC during the seven days through 7:12 EST on 22nd April, according to Bitcoinity data. As in recent weeks, OKCoin and Huobi were responsible for 49.46% and 44.6% of these transactions, respectively.  By comparison, the ether markets experienced far less volatility, ending the week close to where it started.  The token on the Ethereum blockchain network experienced 24-hour trading volume of $13.6m at roughly 12:00 UTC on 15th April, which dipped slightly to $13.4m by approximately 12:00 UTC on 22nd April.  These figures fell far short of this digital currency’s transaction activity over the last month, as 24-hour trading volume reached $22m on 24 March and $15m on 1st April.  SegWit boosts outlook  The week’s most notable development was the release of the code for Segregated Witness (SegWit), an upgrade to the bitcoin protocol that will allow blocks in the blockchain to contain more transactions.  This update, which Bitcoin core developer Pieter Wuille published 19th April, is expected to make bitcoin blocks smaller by storing the part of every transaction containing a digital signature differently, when implemented.  If the bitcoin community adopts SegWit, it should significantly increase block capacity, providing a stopgap solution, observers say, to what could be a continued issue for the network should it want to accommodate more users without additional top-level networks.  But, bitcoin prices will not surge until the broader community has adopted a hard fork solution, Tim Enneking, chairman of Crypto Currency Fund, a digital currency-focused hedge fund, told CoinDesk.  Even though bitcoin developers have not yet moved forward with a hard fork solution to what some consider its scaling issues, many experts emphasized that SegWit’s release has had a positive impact on both the market and community for the digital currency.  Petar Zivkovski, director of operations at Whaleclub, told CoinDesk about how trader sentiment changed after bitcoin’s sharp rise pushed it above $440 on 20th April.  ""Trader sentiment at Whaleclub prior to [today] was predominantly short,” he said on 20th April. ""Now we’re observing a 2.8:1, long-to-short volume ratio. This is 80% higher than the average 2:1 recorded ratio, so we have an 80% excess in long positions (bullish sentiment). This evolution in sentiment shows that many shorts have closed in a small period of time (hence a short squeeze).""  Sentiment turns positive  While Zivkovski supplied hard data, Christopher Burniske, analyst and blockchain products lead at investment management firm ARK Invest, spoke to improving overall sentiment.  ""Miners will soon be able to upgrade their software, and since it is a soft fork there is less fear, uncertainty, doubt around the process,"" Burniske told CoinDesk, adding:  ""In my eyes, this has collectively allowed a big sigh of relief for bitcoin participants.""  Lee, in turn, spoke to how SegWit’s release provides a blow to the arguments used by bitcoin skeptics.  “I believe that we are well on our way towards the plateau of productivity as the general public come to terms with the fact that bitcoin has not died despite repeated public media stunts,” he told CoinDesk.

42378666,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lIEX,1461356724,"Ethcore Raises $750,000 to Help Ethereum Go Enterprise","An Ethereum development startup started by one of the blockchain project's original founders has raised $750,000 in pre-seed funding.  Founded by former Ethereum CTO Gavin Wood, Ethcore said it raised the funding as part its bid to move forward on a product it hopes to evolve for enterprise use. Blockchain Capital and Fenbushi Capital participated in the round.  Wood said that the funding will help EthCore move forward toward the 1.0 release of its Ethereum client, called Parity, and to help it create new development libraries that could be useful to the growing number of enterprise firms seeking to leverage the platform for private and consortium-based project.  He told CoinDesk:  ""We’re glad to have the funding to be able to start looking into how Ethereum can made ready for enterprise.""  The funding comes amid increasing excitement about opportunities in the Ethereum ecosystem from blockchain-focused venture capitalists, a factor that Wood said made the deal appealing for his startup.  ""We really wanted to offer a way into for VC firms, the firms that weren’t heavily vested in an Ethereum, to gain more exposure,"" he said.  Many of the VC firms that have so far specialized in bitcoin and blockchain-focused startups are evaluating Ethereum companies for potential funding, and the ecosystem has even attracted its own VC firm like Fenbushi, which has raised a $50m venture fund it is seeking to invest in blockchain applications.  The fund, announced last September, was co-founded by Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin and BitShares co-founder Bo Shen, and has received funding from China-based auto conglomerate Wanxiang Group.

42426813,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwnTh,1461351764,SWIFT Attracts Jeers and Praise for Distributed Ledger Embrace,"Will the blockchain replace SWIFT?  No fringe concept, the question has long been openly asked by innovators in the blockchain industry as well as FinTech professionals due to the potential of the technology to replace financial intermediaries.  As the ""global backbone of the financial industry"", this is notably one of the core functions that SWIFT today serves.  Accordingly, the question of how SWIFT would respond to this potential threat gained new definition this week with the news that the financial messaging services provider is working to build its own distributed ledger platform. While it's no secret that SWIFT had been exploring the tech, such conversations had previously been highlighted mostly as part of its events, research and its affiliation with the open-source, Linux Foundation-led, Hyperledger project.  Details as to what this could look like were scarce, but SWIFT did suggest its proofs-of-concept currently are exploring how it would integrate distributed ledgers in its SWIFTnet PKI security layer and assess interoperability with its existing electronic data standards, among other use cases.  Still, SWIFT ultimately made clear that it does not believe distributed ledgers are “mature enough to fulfill the requirements of the financial community”, statements that come even as a growing number of the 11,000 financial institutions it offers services explore this question.  Advances in using distributed ledgers for financial messaging are already gaining ground, with tech-friendly payments services providers, including CGI Group, Earthport and IntellectEU, all offering products based on Ripple’s technology.  Amidst this backdrop, the news seems to have sparked a diversity of reactions.  There were positive signs from existing partners that saw the move as a step in the right direction, while more progressive minds like Barclays’ Simon Taylor called it a “‘me too’ moment two years late”.  Still, Spencer Bogart, equity research associate at Needham and Company, perhaps best summed up the overall sentiment, citing it as evidence of blockchain’s market momentum.  Bogart told CoinDesk:  ""SWIFT’s announcement is superfluous evidence of what blockchain industry insiders have known for years­­ – that blockchain poses a real and existential threat to financial intermediaries.""  Lukewarm praise  While Simon was arguably drastic in his statements, most respondents indicated that they believe SWIFT’s plans are perhaps best read as a sign it believes its role in the financial markets could be at risk.  Alex Tapscott, CEO of Northwest Passage Ventures, for example, argued that while it would be “overly simplistic” to say blockchain would replace SWIFT, the organization can’t conduct tests on the “margins of the system” given its potential.  “[SWIFT] should reinvent themselves completely with blockchain at the center of that strategy,” he advised.  Don Tapscott, author of the forthcoming book “Blockchain Revolution”, however, chose to see the event as a net-positive given the difficulties, he said, the financial industry has historically had embracing new technologies.  He said:  ""SWIFT shows signs of avoiding the law of paradigm shifts: ‘Leaders of old paradigms have the greatest difficulty embracing the new.’""  Sharp critiques  Still others were more critical of the report and what they asserted was the lack of specifics it provided to the market.  Respondents as diverse as Dave Birch, director of innovation at electronic transactions advisory firm Consult Hyperion, and Jim Harper, senior fellow at public policy research organization the Cato Institute, reported confusion about the language used and the ideas employed by the report.  ""The report talks about some proofs-of-concept in SWIFT Innovation Labs but does not describe what they are in enough detail for me to say anything sensible about them,"" Birch told CoinDesk.  Specifically, he cited certain proposed positive attributes of distributed ledgers, including ""traceability of transactions” and “efficiency in broadcast information”, as areas where he believes the technology is weak today despite SWIFT’s claims otherwise.  Overall, Harper said he wasn’t optimistic in his assessment of the report, dismissing SWIFT as “entertaining” due to certain assertions about blockchain networks.  ""I see distributed ledgers having little chance of moving forward under SWIFT’s auspices,"" he told CoinDesk. ""One of the principle offerings of blockchains, and especially the bitcoin blockchain is trustlessness, and SWIFT’s value-add is the trust network it has built.""  Elsewhere, Spencer said the big question facing SWIFT was how its distributed ledger platform would evolve and how centralized it would be with the organization at the helm.  Industry innovator  That’s not to say there wasn’t praise for SWIFT and its report.  Of the respondents, those whose products and services currently work with the SWIFT network were the most positive about the announcement.  Hanna Zubko, VP of business development at IntellectEU, for example, stated that the middleware solutions firm has ""always advocated"" that SWIFT should embrace distributed ledgers.  Zubko lauded SWIFT as a reliable and innovative partner and a welcome addition to the distributed ledger ecosystem.  “Nothing will fundamentally change overnight, only careful first steps are taken, but in a very promising direction to say the least,” she said.  Likewise, Michael O’Laughlin, who leads blockchain development at CGI Group, said he saw the announcement as a validation of his firm’s work with distributed ledgers.  Still, Birch noted that those reading reactions should be careful in how they interpret the news, arguing that disruption is likely to happen differently than most believe.  As such, he asserted there would likely still be a need for the organization, even if distributed ledgers were broadly embraced.  Birch concluded:  “I'm sure a shared ledger implementation could replace the SWIFT system — it’s easy to imagine banks having SWIFT gateways but there’s no SWIFT in the middle because every gateway contains the ledgers — but it won’t replace the SWIFT organization.”  Thrown tomato image via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET | RESEARCH,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2016/04/22/swift-attracts-jeers-and-praise-for-distributed-ledger-embrace,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5a436acbb051c579a4b6c4cf0e39d3e3552af587-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42426830,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwnph,1461346126,European Parliament Member: Everyone Should 'Get Some Bitcoins',"A European Parliament member delivered an impassioned speech this week to an influential committee on consumer protection as part of an ultimately successful campaign to take the next step toward implementing new measures related to blockchain tech.  Antanas Guoga, an EU parliament member representing Lithuania, called blockchain a “perfect technology” as he spoke before the Internal Market for Consumer Protection Committee, which is weighing whether to advance a proposal for a new virtual currency task force.  Guoga went on to encourage members to do their own investigation of bitcoin, telling the committee:  ""I’m sure a lot of us politicians haven’t got any bitcoins at the moment and we’re trying to make laws for something we don’t understand. I would suggest everyone to get some bitcoins and really learn about the system. It’s a huge leap forward and a huge opportunity.""  The committee reportedlyhttp://edcab.eu/blockchain-expo/ulrike-trebesius-mep-supports-virtual-currencies-in-the-european-parliament went on to pass the measure with a ""huge majority"" of member support.  Push for task force  The measure asks the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, to either create a new ""task force"" for monitoring virtual currency development or expand an existing task force to cover the technology.  In a statement provided to CoinDesk, the report’s author, Ulrike Trebesius, advocated for an international standard of regulation for the technology, adding that in addition to supporting the creation of the task force, the committee had also decided to support guidance on the development of other digital ledger technologies for non-financial applications.  ""We have achieved a technology-friendly solution to virtual currencies…Europe needs innovation and we need to keep the innovators in Europe and enable them to reach commercial success,"" Trebesius said.  Votes were cast the day after the newly formed European Digital Currency & Blockchain Technology Forum (EDCAB) held a roundtable series for policymakers and industry leaders in the European Parliament. The non-profit organization spent much of this week engaging with policymakers ahead of the committee vote.  From here, the EU Parliament Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs will consider whether to to support the proposal as well. A vote on the proposal will be held on 26th April.

42426822,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwnjh,1461339891,Republic of Georgia to Develop Blockchain Land Registry,"Bitcoin mining company BitFury has inked a deal with the Georgian government to develop a system for registering land titles using the blockchain.  BitFury will help develop the platform for the National Agency of Public Registry (NAPR), an office of the Georgian Ministry of Justice. Economist Hernando de Soto will assist in the development of the platform. Today de Soto is set to give a lecture on related issues during an event in Georgia's capital, Tbilisi.  According to BitFury, the platform will utilize a permissioned blockchain operated by the NAPR. This private blockchain will be tied to the bitcoin blockchain, the company said, suggesting a form of merge-mining will secure the land registry.  Papuna Ugrekhelidze, chairman of the NAPR, said in a statement that the project can boost title transparency and reduce the prevalence of fraud. The office did not respond to a request for additional comment.  Ugrekhelidze remarked:  “By building a Blockchain-based property registry and taking full advantage of the security provided by the Blockchain technology, the Republic of Georgia can show the world that we are a modern, transparent and corruption-free country that can lead the world in changing the way land titling is done and pave the way to additional prosperity for all.”  The bitcoin and blockchain space is no stranger to this particular use case.

42426826,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwnth,1461338111,Payments Firm CGI Latest to Add Ripple Tech to Product Line,"CGI Group has become the latest firm to integrate distributed ledgers into an existing payments product, announcing the addition of Ripple Connect to its Intelligent Gateway at Payments 2016 this week.  As with other Ripple partner firms, CGI is seeking to use the startup’s settlement solution to help clients improve the speed and efficiency of financial messaging. Described as a rules-driven, messaging-based router, the Intelligent Gateway was previously used for SWIFT-specific products.  More broadly, however, the integration provides the latest example of how incumbents are leveraging distributed ledgers without the use of digital assets or digital currencies, to bring elements of the technology live today.  Michael O'Loughlin, who leads blockchain development at CGI, explained that one of the main benefits of the integration with Ripple is that it now enables clients to have a wider variety of choices when sending payment information. This, he asserted, could reduce fees and rejected transactions, thereby helping clients cut costs.  O'Loughlin told CoinDesk:  ""It’s almost like an intelligent router. When a payment is received by a bank, it can look at it and ask, 'Is it cheaper and faster and more efficient to send it through wires?' 'Do they need it real time?' With this, you're giving them an option and adding a new rail with Ripple connect.""  In this way, O'Loughlin explained that the product itself doesn’t use the tech, so much as allow clients to have the option to leverage it when advantageous. For example, he likened the idea behind allowing competition in financial ledgers to allowing Amazon customers the option to receive packages more quickly through services like Amazon Prime.  Santino Failla, director of global payments solutions, emphasized that the product aims to speed up financial messaging by automatically translating financial messages from the different formats used by varying internal and external partners.  ""Maybe their format is MT103,"" Failla said, referring to the SWIFT messaging format. ""We can transform it to Ripple XML, and we can do the reverse. The existing infrastructure doesn’t know that anything happened.""  Failla further indicated that a key value-add of the product is the speed with which it allows users to begin using Ripple’s technology. He said that with the Intelligent Gateway product, clients could integrate distributed ledgers into their workflow in just three months.  By this time, CGI said it is seeking for clients to use the tool as part of proofs-of-concept, and to offer its supporting services as they seek to transition projects to supporting partial and full volumes for real-world payments.  For CGI, the project also represents a step forward in its partnership with Ripple, first announced in November 2015.  Open approach  Still, O’Loughlin sought to frame the move as part of CGI’s progressive approach to technology more broadly. For example, he noted how he believes its approach to design is more open than those in use by competitors.  ""The intelligent gateway is truly hub-agnostic,"" he said. ""A lot of these gateways and routers are sold with an existing payments hub. This can work with a competitor’s code.""  O'Loughlin said that the Intelligent Gateway product is now more “ledger agnostic” than it is has been in the past, a development he framed as just one way CGI is keeping pace with payments modernization.  ""We wanted to approach the world in a non-naive way,"" he continued. ""We’re saying our tech can’t win them all.""  Following the integration, clients will now be able to enable the new tool with the product’s next release, opting into the service. O’Loughlin compared this process to ""turning on Wi-Fi"" for existing users.  The development follows a beta testing of the product, which O’Loughlin said had received ""overwhelmingly"" positive feedback.  Value add  As for why potential clients should use the Intelligent Gateway over a direct integration with Ripple, the CGI team stressed that its product would be able to offer a ""seamless integration"" into existing bank environments, with ""minimal disruption"".  Cathy Pin, head of global payment solutions at CGI, stressed that this would be beneficial to clients, who would gain confidence in a technology that many financial incumbents are still in early stages of understanding.  ""Innovation is hard for a bank. They are the protectors of identity and value. Along with the software, you want to bring in the right expertise to help the stakeholders who want to engage,"" she said. ""The tech is the cool stuff and we can all spend hours talking about it, but the behaviors also need to be addressed.""  O’Loughlin went on to stress that the product comes with the benefits of CGI’s experience and ecosystem of tools, which he framed as valuable for institutions given the speed at which distributed ledger tech is evolving.  ""We’ve left behind a sandbox where people can plug and play and integrate and play around with the tech. You’re getting the consulting, the methodology, the agile development,"" he said, concluding:  ""The Intelligent Gateway is bringing it together.""

42426810,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwnNh,1461330113,Ex-JPMorgan Trader Explains Why $440 Bitcoin Price is Too Low,"Daniel Masters is the former head of energy trading at JP Morgan and the director of the Jersey-based hedge fund, Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment Fund Plc.  In this opinion article, Masters discusses the upcoming halving of rewards on the bitcoin network, speculating on how this may impact the price of the digital currency this year.  28th November, 2012 was a slow news day.  There was a lunar eclipse, the second that year, and it was the first day since 1990 that the NYPD reported that no one was shot, stabbed or slashed in New York. There wasn’t much to report. And while journalists around the world searched for a scoop, one small story went uncovered – the reward for mining a block on the bitcoin blockchain had just halved.  Commencing in 9th January, 2009 when the bitcoin blockchain initiated, each and every one of the 209,999 blocks mined – created at a rate of approximately one every 10 minutes, in an uninterrupted 24/7 operation – had attracted a new, autonomous creation by the network itself of 50 new, never before seen, bitcoin.  A lot had changed since 2009. The first block mined had one transaction (the special ""coinbase"" transaction that captures the reward) and no other activity. By 2012, the network size and activity had grown significantly, and there were 543 transactions in the ""pre-halving"" block.  The next block mined, at a height of precisely 210,000 blocks, as codified years earlier by Satoshi Nakamoto, had a 25 bitcoin reward.  So what?  Nothing much happened. However, a few months later the value of a bitcoin increased dramatically. Prices had been steadily increasing as the halving approached, they ended 2011 at $7, and rose to $11 by September, 2012.  The high tick by April 2013 was $259.  Halving expected  Needless to say, bitcoin has demonstrated stomach-churning volatility in the past and this meteoric rise has been met with considerable turbulence. None of this may in fact have had anything to do with the halving. It’s impossible to determine that one way or the other.  But even so, there had certainly been an extraordinary chance to profit.  So now, we look forward to the next pre-ordained halving, at a block height of precisely 420,000. We sit at 408,138 at the time of writing, with the next halving expected on or around 11th July, 2016. At that moment the 25 BTC per block reward halves again, to 12.5 BTC.  It is interesting to think about whether we will see another price rise following this next event. I’m confident that there won't be fireworks on the day itself, and indeed there is some prospect that prices will rise in advance of the event, fully discounting the effect ahead of time. I don’t see that happening currently.  At this moment, the value of all bitcoin in circulation is $6.7bn. At the old rate of issuance, that puts $575m of new coin in circulation per year.  Prices so far in 2016 have been relatively stable. That tells me that there is enough new investment and real time demand to match the creation of $575m new coin. It seems obvious that if that dollar-sized demand persists, which I believe it will, that the price of bitcoin must rise to meet it.  Rate of inventory  Naysayers and haters will – in addition to the normal criticism of bitcoin – say that a drop of $288m per year in supply is not meaningful when compared to the $6.7 billion inventory. That’s not how commodities work.  Just think about what happened recently in the oil market.  Just taking the US, we now have more oil and refined products in inventory than since records began, over 2 billion barrels. Yet the price of oil has risen 60% from the $25 low early in the year.  OPEC has hinted that oil production introduced to the market will no longer rise. This will do very little indeed to change the inventory picture. It will remain engorged.  So why the massive rally? Because commodities price on the rate of change of inventory, not on inventory.  When bitcoin dipped in price in June 2015, I stated passionately prices couldn’t remain in the 200s.  I’m equally convinced that today, a price of $440 is, once again, too low.
