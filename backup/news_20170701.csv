42379548,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX88d6p,1498914920,Tame the Whales? Developer Nick Johnson Thinks He Can Fix ICOs,"Now that initial coin offerings (ICOs) are launching almost daily on the ethereum blockchain, ""whales"" are becoming a particularly sore subject.  By buying up vast amounts of tokens, these large traders are effectively pushing smaller investors out of the picture – and it isn't just with their sheer buying power either. In some cases, whales are going so far as to game the system, taking advantage of market dynamics and paying higher-than-average transaction fees on purchases. (One participant in a May ICO even paid $6,000 to hop the line ahead of other buyers.)  Either way, whales spell big trouble for projects. Because when one or two entities hold a vast majority of a token supply, they have all the power of a central bank to control the market.  But, developer Nick Johnson thinks he has found a way to distribute tokens more evenly and reduce congestion on the ethereum network at the same time. No novice coder, Johnson is employed by the Ethereum Foundation, the Swiss non-profit that manages the project itself.  His idea? Treat ICOs more like auctions and spread the sale out over days, instead of hours.  ""In my mind, the sensible way to do things is to use some kind of system that establishes a market equilibrium price and does not depend heavily on the time in which you participate,"" he told CoinDesk in an interview.  Based on that, Johnson has put together a proposal for a new token sale smart contract, one that he believes could have a material impact on the market if implemented widely.  Striking a balance  If Johnson's name rings a bell, that's because he is the co-creator of the ethereum name service (ENS), an auction registrar for ethereum names.  And like the ENS, Johnson's token sale is based on a Vickrey auction, where bids are sealed. The idea being that people are more likely to bid on the true value of an item when they are not influenced by what others are bidding.  Johnson’s token sale works something like this: First, the seller (or project owner) sets a maximum number of tokens to sell or a maximum amount of ether to raise. Either can be a limiting factor, but Johnson suspects that in most instances, the supply of tokens will remain variable, while the amount of ether raised will be fixed.  Next, the seller announces a time period for when prospective token buyers can place their bids. Bidders then submit the maximum price they are willing to pay for a token and the quantity of tokens they want to purchase.  When the bidding period ends, the seller then calculates a strike price, or the optimal price for a token based on the collected bids. (At this stage, bids can also be revealed, so everyone can see which ethereum addresses bid how much for how many tokens.)  After the strike price is set, those who bid at that price or above can redeem their tokens at that price; those who bid below the strike price, will get their ether returned to them.  It is worth mentioning that the strike price calculation is the only part of Johnson's token sale that is handled off of the ethereum blockchain. Even so, sellers have every incentive to calculate that price correctly.  If they set the price too high, for instance, they will lose sellers on the low end. In contrast, if they set the price too low, the built-in limitation on the amount of ether they want to raise will kick in. The strike price is the point at which they raise the most money, while having to sell the fewest tokens.  Johnson also recommends that sellers publish the strike price and reveal bids at the same time, so that bidders can verify the strike price was calculated correctly.  So far, Johnson has put the Solidity code for the proof-of-concept in Github. But, he warns, the code is untested and should not be used in production. Further, he said that while he does not have time to finish the project, he would be available to audit code if anyone else wished to step in.  Setting limits  But right now, Johnson’s proposal is still conceptual. That leaves many ICO projects out there grappling with innovative – but not always successful – ways to broaden token distribution.  One obvious solution is to cap individual sales. But who is there to cap? Everyone on the blockchain is pseudonymous. On ethereum, for instance, a user is represented by a hexadecimal ethereum address. This makes it easy for a single entity to create multiple ""Sybil"" accounts.  Two recent projects emphasize the challenges involved.  Ethereum messenger app Status, which recently raised $100m, attempted to use a ""dynamic ceiling"" to cap individual sales. When anyone tried sending in too large an amount of ether to buy tokens, only a portion of the bid was accepted and the rest was kicked back.  The idea backfired, however, when several buyers wrote scripts allowing them to send transactions from multiple ethereum addresses. As a result, the ICO contract was spammed with Sybil attacks, and many transactions were left ""pending"" for days after the sale ended, causing a general slowdown in the ethereum network.  On the heels of the Status ICO, ethereum-based decentralized exchange OmiseGo, decided to take an altogether different approach.  The project ended up handing over the near entirety of its $25m capped token sale to brokerage firm Bitcoin Suisse. To buy OMG tokens, buyers had to sign up for account and get their real-world identities verified first.  Although using an intermediary defies the ethos of a blockchain (where the main goal is to keep things decentralized and user identities under wraps), the project saw no alternativehttps://www.omise.co/omisego-crowdfunding-structure-update, according to OmiseGo special adviser Thomas Greco.  ""It was disappointing for us to research and realize there was no clearly safe way we could do this on-chain right now,"" he said.  But if Johnson's token sale concept gets implemented soon, the hope is that future ICOs won't need a third party to do all of that.  Johnson summed up his scheme's advantages, saying:  ""If you build a system where you can establish a market price, and everyone can participate in the market at that price, there is no undue advantage to whales. And so it becomes irrelevant whether you are a real person – or not.""

42379561,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX88dNB,1498904432,"ICOs, Dumb Money and Ethereum's (Eth)ical Dilemma","Matt Prusak is a Schwarzman Scholar at Tsinghua University in Beijing City, China; the business development manager of Jupiter, an Internet of Things startup; and an investment strategist at Tano Capital.  In this opinion piece, Prusak speaks to the hype surrounding ethereum and the tokens being created on the platform, ultimately issuing a stern warning to new investors.    ""Double, treble, quadruple bubble, watch the stock market get into trouble…"" – Garth Nix    Is the bubble about to pop?  The popularity of trading cryptocurrencies, especially ether (ethereum's ether coin), has spread like wildfire in the past few months. With ether returning roughly 3,000% since January, it comes as little surprise many are interested in cashing in on the ""next bitcoin.""  However, market prices are looking increasingly worrisome for several reasons, ranging from the influx of naïve investors to the onslaught of initial coin offerings (ICOs). As such, now may be a good time to consider taking profits off the table and waiting for a correction before entering.  Blockchain and ethereum have great long-term potential, but face short-term hurdles. Why wait and try to time the dips, when you can sell now and buy the crash?  The lake and the streams  To analogize, think of the ethereum ecosystem (ethereum, plus all the alternative coins on top of it, such as Augur, Golem or Gnosis) as a lake.  Since January, an enormous amount of fiat currency has flown into this lake, rapidly raising the price of ether in expectation of future value being realized, and pushing the lake to a high-water mark. The reality was that there simply were not enough credible places for the lake to flow into; people preferred to keep their capital in ether, because the returns on ether have historically been better than any of the initial altcoins it spawned.  Enter the ICOs.  These ICOs provided a raft of new investment opportunities for ether holders to take advantage of. Similar to IPOs in the dot-com boom, ethereum investors were eager to funnel ether into the ICOs of startups building companies on top of ethereum. In exchange for their ether, investors received tradeable tokens. Once the tokens hit the exchanges for open trading, early investors could either cash in on the expected trading ""pop"" or continue to speculate on the future rise of these tokens as the companies develop.  These altcoins are ""streams"" where all the pent-up capital held in ether will flow into.  While ether itself is the base, capital is now being increasingly siphoned off into these coins. Without a continuous large influx of capital from fiat investors into the ethereum ecosystem, the value of ether will stabilize or fall.  Meanwhile, investors who continue to hold ether itself cheer on the ""Flippening"" – the moment when ethereum's market cap will exceed bitcoin's, and thereby dethrone bitcoin as the dominant cryptocurrency. What these investors don’t realize is that the Flippening is essentially already upon us. They should not be comparing the market cap of bitcoin (which largely stands in isolation) to the market cap of ether.  Instead, they should be comparing the market cap of the ethereum ecosystem to bitcoin, ie the aggregate market cap of ether along with all its altcoins.  If you look at cryptocurrency market caps, seven of the top 10 are already based on ethereum. For those expecting another rapid doubling in price, they may be left waiting as value continues to diffuse across various ethereum-based tokens.  Dumb money follows smart money  The rise in ether prices in the last few months has unsurprisingly resulted in an enormous amount of press on the future of the technology.  This has invited speculation from investors who are fairly ill-informed on the space, and intend not to miss out on the ""next bitcoin."" Enormous investor pile-on has driven the price sky high, with capital coming from (psychologically fragile) speculators who are not particularly versed in the technology.  It's similar to what Fred Schwed, Jr, the author of ""Where Are the Customers' Yachts?"", said:  ""There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by either words or pictures. Nor can any description I might offer here even approximate what it feels like to lose a real chunk of money that you used to own.""  Any security dominated by retail investors is going to have a massive amount of volatility driven by sentiment. Even a veteran of the stock market is unlikely to have the stomach for consistent 25% price swings in a given week. The only reason most speculators in cryptocurrency can bear this volatility is because of enormous confidence in future return. That means if this confidence is shattered and the market corrects, it is likely going to correct quickly and with force.  This is not helped by the fact that inflowing investors have no idea what this technology does.  For proof of that, all you have to do is look at the rise in price of ethereum classic, up from $5.86 on April 30 to $21.53 today. Ethereum classic, a product of a schism in its blockchain community last year, is not interchangeable with the main ethereum blockchain. In fact, market commentators have predicted that ethereum classic will more or less die off.  While it has the same fundamental technology, ethereum classic has essentially nothing to do with the mass adoption of ethereum by recent projects (and the formation of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance) – yet the price continues to rise.  While there are some obscure investment cases to be made for ethereum classic, it strikes me as highly likely the price has been driven significantly higher by uninformed investors simply not understanding the difference between the two – similar to how adding "".com"" to a company’s name in 1999 sent stock prices up on average 74%.  Further compounding the issue is that there has been a rise in retail investors with a limited grasp of how finance works. When Coinbase's GDAX exchange briefly crashed to $0.10 per ether on 21st June (from its current range of around roughly $300) as a result of a massive sell order, hundreds of margin traders were liquidated.  While the exchange requires traders to confirm they are accredited investors with at least $5m in assets, all investors had to do to gain access to triple-leverage on their capital was click a button saying they were accredited. No KYC needed.  Needless to say, chatter on the internet following this crash and the resulting liquidations made it clear that many of these ""accredited investors"" were nothing of the sort. Instead, they were speculators who took risks well outside their means in expectation of high future returns.  Pleas for Coinbase to ""undo"" the trades and threats of a class-action lawsuit initially fell on deaf ears, but then the company announced it would both honor the trades and make up the losses for investors. Deus ex machina aside, this invites further reckless investing.  A flagship exchange has now demonstrated it will bail out margin traders who had willingly taken outsized risks. In doing so, Coinbase has effectively offered a bungee cord to daredevil investors, creating a severe moral hazard issue.  Naïve investors will continue to flow in, only making things worse.  Who hasn't bought into ethereum?  A quick glance around the internet shows public interest in ethereum has far surpassed its original, niche crowd.  While mainstream adoption of the technology is great, interest in getting rich is driving the most recent mania.  The father of Vitalik Buterin, ethereum’s 23-year-old creator, tweeted on 13th June that he overheard a friend's 71-year-old aunt being pitched a no-lose investment in ethereum by a coffee shop manager:  The Wall Street Journal quoted a grooming-products business owner, Zachary Mallard recently for his perspective on ethereum versus bitcoin:  ""A lot of my friends are selling their bitcoin and buying ethereum.""  BroBible, a website targeted at college fraternity brothers, posted a piece last week entitled ""What Is The Etherum Cyrptocurrency And How Will It Make You Rich AF?"" First, the site probably should have spelled ""Ethereum"" correctly before recommending it as an investment product. Second, on a more editorial note, ""AF,"" ie ""as fuck"", seems a bit dubious as a projected level of valuation.  This level of ridiculous bullishness is everywhere.  Subreddits focused on ethereum are plastered with memes about buying Lamborghinis, and technical analysis (TA) plotting how quickly ether will reach $1,000 a coin. An investor pool guided by TA might as well be relying on astrology.  Newcomers bemoan their lack of instant return on an investment that has grown 90%-plus in the past month alone. Bullishness is now so high that the default when there is no news is a downward trend in price, implying that as soon as hot air from optimistic press stops being pumped in, ethereum will deflate.  This is not an atmosphere that indicates rational investing.  As Bernard Baruch wrote about the 1929 stock boom:  ""Taxi drivers told you what to buy. The shoeshine boy could give you a summary of the day's financial news as he worked with rag and polish. An old beggar who regularly patrolled the street in front of my office now gave me tips and, I suppose, spent the money I and others gave him in the market. My cook had a brokerage account and followed the ticker closely. Her paper profits were quickly blown away in the gale of 1929.""  Last week an Uber driver was telling me about his investments in cryptocurrency. History doesn't repeat itself, but it does rhyme.  Will institutional traders save the day? Sadly for the bulls, the entrance of mainstream institutional players seems unlikely in the short term.  Goldman Sachs's most recent coverage (only written after investors begged them to cover bitcoin) stated that cryptocurrencies are in a bubble. The ICOs (detailed below) pretty clearly confirm this hypothesis.  Once government regulation improves (which is antithetical to the decentralized, anarchic nature of the technology in the first place), institutional interest will undoubtedly turn into action, but for now, investment banks directly trading the coins seems unlikely.  ICOs = 'idiots constantly overbuying'  ICO valuations are insane. Ethereum has basically just become an ""ICO machine.""  These are companies getting Series C level funding for seed-level products – we're talking tens of millions in valuations for white papers and teams with no track record. Many of these will fail.  Ethereum itself only raised $18m during its crowd sale.  Last year, a company that ICO'd took the investor's money and went on a vacation in Spain. At this time, the SEC wouldn't care even if they just burned it in front of your eyes. This is the Wild West of capitalism.  Just to take the pulse of the current market, here are two recent ICOs that would have had more red flags than the Beijing Olympics if assessed by the professional venture capital community, yet had astronomically successful ICOs.  Exhibit 1: Bancor , a market-making startup that failed to properly make its own market    Bancor raised about $153m in roughly three hours. Even they did not anticipate this: the funding campaign overshot the initial target by $51m, and thereby inflated the supply of Bancor’s tokens over 50% of the intended amount, while simultaneously congesting the entire ethereum network.  This is fairly ironic, given network congestion is a critique more commonly leveled at bitcoin.  Shortly after the ICO, a piece entitled ""Bancor is Flawed"" skewered the overall concept of the (not yet existing) Bancor system on numerous levels. While Bancor issued a lengthy response, the sheer number of issues raised by the critique calls into question whether investors really knew what they were getting into.  My guess: most investors have no clue what Bancor really does.  Exhibit 2: Patientory, a healthcare records startup with no track record of its own    Patientory recently ICO'd at $7.2m, and currently, less than a month later, has a market cap north of $20m (after peaking at $60m in-between). Its CEO has less than four years of professional work experience and a non-technical background (she has an MA in business management and dual BAs in Africana studies/Spanish), and is running a company whose market cap went from $7.2m to $60m in a single month, despite not having a finished product or revenue, much less profit.  For those keen on more details, a scathing, seven-point critique of Patientory’s business plan is online. The fact that patient data could possibly be leaked into the public blockchain, and be permanently recorded is only one concern among many.  While there are only two examples, they're fairly representative of the overall market. While other companies have much more credible plans (Brave's BAT and Mysterium are two I find compelling), the valuations of all of these firms are intrinsically linked. Once a few major blockchain startups fail, investor confidence across the ecosystem will be shattered as people rush to sell their tokens before they become worthless.  Even assuming failing startups do not induce a short-term correction, the ICOs in general have led to concentration of ether in the hands of these overvalued startups. CEOs cannot pay employees and development costs in ether – they're going to need to transfer this back to fiat in order to do so.  Once they all start liquidating, the other firms are going to be similarly incentivized to sell their holdings in order to get as much fiat money as possible. While startups are incentivized to hold ether in order to keep the price stable, they have to weigh that against market prices falling and crippling their non-fiat reserves.  The bottom line  I am bullish on blockchain, and very bullish on ethereum.  However, I would not buy in at this price. If you bought in well-below the current price and continue to hold, great. But the potential upside compared to risk seems askew at today's price. The smart money got in far beneath the current figure (and potentially may soon be out). If you first heard about ethereum from The New York Times, you're not the smart money.  Perhaps I’m totally wrong. Perhaps the endless influx of investor dollars overcomes the inevitable failure of most of these ICO'd companies. Or perhaps you can time the horizon of this crunch. If so, more power to you. But what if the drop happens when you're asleep? The 24/7 markets do have that issue.  Or what if a crash blows through the entire order book, and your stop-loss gets filled far beneath its placement amount? That happened this past week to many investors.  If you are keen to squeeze out some additional profit, these are the risks you will have to take.  To summarize:  The price of ethereum has rocketed upwards in the past few months, indicative of blockchain’s potential.  Dumb money has now followed the smart money.  Ether's price may have leveled off due to ICOs now providing an outlet for capital outflow.  Many of these ICOs will fail, punishing the dumb money and inducing a correction.    My prediction is ethereum will take a big hit in the next six months. Take the easy gains and wait for the correction.  Caveat emptor.

42379551,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX88dAb,1498877676,Delaware House Passes Historic Blockchain Regulation,"The state of Delaware has passed amendments to state law that make explicit the right to trade stocks on a blockchain, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter.  Crammed in at the last minute before the state House went into recess, the measures were part of a broader series of amendments that legally recognized any number of records being stored on a blockchain.  While details regarding the vote are still emerging, the director of the Global Delaware state initiative, Andrea Tinianow, described the news in an email to CoinDesk:  ""Now, you have something to [write] about!!! History being made.""  One source indicated that the bill passed with near unanimity, with a single vote against. The vote is widely considered to be the final obstacle to state adoption, following the passage of the bill in the Senate earlier this month.  Chair of the corporate law section of the Delaware bar association, Matthew O'Toole, told CoinDesk he expects the state's governor, John Carney, to sign the bill into law by the end of July, with an effective date of 1stAugust.  In an email to CoinDesk, O'Toole said the vote ""keeps Delaware at the forefront of corporate law and in the lead in terms of enabling the use of 'distributed ledger shares'.""  He added:  ""We look forward to helping Delaware corporations enjoy the benefits of this innovative new amalgamation of law and technology.""  The amendments to legislature in the state of Delaware, where there are more companies incorporated than there are residents, could have far flung implications to the way companies are listed in the future.  Developed under the close guidance of blockchain lawyer Marco Santori of Cooley LLP and Caitlin Long of blockchain startup Symbiont, the bill is expected to pave the way for potentially large-scale issuance of stock on a blockchain.  By trading stock on a blockchain or similar distributed ledgers, middlemen who profit along the several steps that currently exist between buyers and sellers of stocks could be cut out of the process, resulting in significantly faster settlement times.  The bill was introduced last year by the previous governor, Jack Markell, following requests made by multiple companies for the legislation – which was already lenient to blockchain stocks – to make explicit the legality of such issuances, according to CoinDesk sources.  “This is big for Delaware,” Symbiont's Long told CoinDesk, further explaining the potential benefits of the amendments:  ""The bill solidifies its leadership in corporate registry services by enabling end-to-end digitization for administration of securities. Banks are eager to use the automated filing procedures it enables for liens on collateral.""
