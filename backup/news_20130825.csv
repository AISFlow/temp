42416883,eB3NjBN6VPjgNZ6DbOxhOo,1377465280,Federal agency representatives meeting to discuss bitcoin,"Representatives from a number of US federal agencies are attending a conference on Monday (26th August) to discuss bitcoin.  Hosted by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) at the US treasury building in Washington DC, the meeting will be attended by high-level representatives from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Federal Reserve.  Also attending will be representatives from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the Secret Service and the Department of Homeland Security.  Patrick Murck, Brian Klein, Marco Santori and Peter Vessenes will represent the Bitcoin Foundation at the event and Jim Harper, director of information policy studies at Cato Institute, will also be present.  Murck said the conference will help regulators, policymakers and law enforcement officials to better understand the Bitcoin protocol and distributed finance. He believes that, once these representatives understand bitcoin, they will be able to make better decisions and develop new methodologies for identifying and interceding illicit activity.  ""Bitcoin and distributed finance is here to stay and our preferred path forward is a cooperative one, where we all can help ease each other's transition into an inclusive and distributed global financial system,"" Murck added.  He views the conference as the beginning of a conversation about the appropriate role of government and law enforcement in the emerging digital currency space. ""Our hope is that this is the beginning of an open and transparent dialog between good-faith stakeholders to find common ground and develop public-private partnerships.""  Murck said it is ""refreshing"" that US regulators at the federal level are taking a responsible approach to working with the industry to understand these issues. ""Contrast that with what we are seeing at the state level, where regulators seem more interested in rushing to conclusions and tripping over themselves to be first-movers without regard to the unintended consequences for the industry and US policy at the national level.""  On Tuesday, the foundation is meeting with council and staff members of several US congressmen and senators at Capitol Hill to discuss legal issues surrounding bitcoin.  Santori, who is chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation's Regulatory Affairs Committee, said: ""The foundation is committed to establishing itself as the first resource for government policymakers. Through history, it has always been critical that a government understands the industries it governs, and bitcoin is no different.  ""Bitcoin deserves a voice in Washington. The foundation is ensuring that voice is clear and distinct.""  Various states in the US have started taking action against bitcoin companies of late. Earlier this month, the New York Department of Financial Services (DFS) issued subpoenas to 22 bitcoin companies and, in June, California’s state financial regulator issued a cease and desist order against the Bitcoin Foundation.  The central government showed some interest in bitcoin recently too, with a US Senate Committee asking the Department of Homeland Security for information on any policies, guidance, plans and strategies they have relating to virtual currencies.  Santori hopes a ""safe, carefully-tailored regulatory environment"" will soon be created for bitcoin so that innovation can continue in the United States.

42416875,eB3NjBN6VPjgNZ6DbOxh8Y,1377423942,MasterCoin to create new altcoins in Bitcoin's block chain,"Bitcoin expert J. R. Willet is looking to transform not just Bitcoin, but the cryptocurrency world. In his view, Bitcoin is incomplete, and has led to the creation of altcoins which he says has diluted the message of Bitcoin. He wants to change the situation by creating a protocol layer that exists on top of Bitcoin.  That protocol layer will allow for a plethora of new digital currencies to be created that will all exist on the Bitcoin block chain. It's called MasterCoin.  The MasterCoin protocol can be described by analogy to the HTTP protocol, which the World Wide Web runs on, being a layer that exists on top of the TCP/IP protocol and that working atop the IPv4 protocol. It will enable new protocols, i.e. new currencies, to exist as part of Bitcoin, and not something different from it. In other words, currencies created on top of MasterCoin will use the Bitcoin block chain.  In the specification that Willet published online, he describes altcurrencies as: ""Alternate block chains compete with bitcoins financially, confuse our message to the world, and dilute our efforts. These barriers interfere with the adoption momentum of bitcoin and the adoption momentum of alternate currencies as well, regardless of how well-conceived their rules may be.""  ""Alternate block chains compete with bitcoins financially, confuse our message to the world, and dilute our efforts"" - J. R. Willet  Colored Coin similarities  What Willet wants to do is similar to the idea of Colored Coins. MasterCoin will facilitate the creation of new currencies that can be assigned data streams from stock or commodity markets, thus making them represent the value of the selected item. For example, Willet intends to create USD Coin and GoldCoin, which will track the values of their corresponding commodities.  Enforcement of the market value for whatever stock or commodity a ""higher protocol"" currency relates to will be achieved by the use of an escrow fund built into the currency's protocol. When the value of the ""commodity coin"" goes too high, the currency's escrow fund will start creating new commodity coins in exchange for MasterCoins. When the value is too low, it will trade MasterCoins in exchange for commodity coins, then destroy those coins. Through this control of supply and demand, a MasterCoin derived currency can sustain a balanced value. The efficacy of this will depend how intensively the currency's author sets the protocol to check and interact with the market.  Savings addresses  That's not all that MasterCoin will do, there is also support for ""savings addresses"". This is a MasterCoin feature that adds an extra layer of protection to those storing their wealth in digital currency. With savings addresses, MasterCoin has the ability to reverse transactions – whereas ordinary transactions from ""spending wallets"" are irreversible just as with the basic Bitcoin protocol. To complement the savings wallet, there is a ""Guardian"" wallet which is used for receiving reversed transactions – this is to be used when someone believes their savings wallet has been compromised.  That's the theory. The practice is shaping up too – you can follow Willet's progress on the Bitcoin forum.  The Exodus Address  Willet has created something called the ""Exodus Address"", which is a bitcoin wallet that will serve the same purpose to the MasterCoin protocol as the genesis block did to the Bitcoin block chain. Not only is the Exodus Address a marker on the Bitcoin block chain, but Willet is also using it as a way to fund his efforts. Those donating to the Exodus Address before the 31st August 2013 will be rewarded with a hundred times more MasterCoins than the bitcoins donated. There is also an early adopter bonus where the (fractional) number of weeks prior to the deadline determines the bonus amount of MasterCoins. At the time of writing the Exodus Address had received over 2,107 BTC (more than $220,000).  As for what he'll be using that money for, he responded: ""I have had a few minor expenses, but most of that money will probably be used for bounties once I have the basic code-base set up. Also, I'm not touching the money at that address until the fundraising is done [on] 1st September.""  Investment risks highlighted  Willet is also keen to highlight the risks that would-be investors face. He has published a partial list of risks and his specification paper even goes so far as to say: ""Investing in experimental currencies is really, absurdly risky.""  ""Investing in experimental currencies is really, absurdly risky"" – J. R. Willet  Willet's specification also speculates that MasterCoin will be even more attractive to criminals than bitcoin. When asked why, he replied: ""I think criminals (like the rest of us) will prefer to deal with stable currencies rather than unstable ones. Also, betting on data streams will likely be a breeding ground for insider trading. (Note: I'm writing this protocol, but I'll be very careful not to use it for anything like that myself – I would prefer to stay out of jail!)""  It's an intriguing idea that raises a lot of possibilities. It's also fair to say that you need to have an in-depth understanding of the protocol to really appreciate it. Even then, some on the Bitcoin forum have questioned the validity of MasterCoin.  Block chain bloat  Also, the user of higher level protocols requires miniscule transactions to (so-called) 'fake addresses' as a means of passing data through the block chain. This in turn will lead to even more clutter and overhead on the size of bitcoin's public ledger.  Willet admits this is a problem, ""Yes, this will cause some additional headaches for bitcoin scalability. If wildly successful, this sort of protocol layer will make the impact of Satoshi Dice seem pretty tame in comparison. However, this is a problem we need to face sooner or later anyway.""  ""If wildly successful, this sort of protocol layer will make the impact of Satoshi Dice seem pretty tame in comparison."" – J. R. Willet  Furthermore, while Willet argues that altcoins are diluting bitcoin's message to the world, those currencies are here. For MasterCoin to succeed in bringing focus back to the bitcoin movement, it would have to cause altcoins to fall out of use in favour of MasterCoin derived currencies.  How likely do you think this is? Have you invested in MasterCoin? Would you want to trade in commodity driven cryptocurrencies?",NEUTRAL,BTC,ALTCOIN | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE,David Gilson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/08/25/mastercoin-to-create-new-altcoins-in-bitcoins-block-chain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f8bc8ff086edcda174a697fdeaba940b43cec0af-1000x500.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
