42400070,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzVxO,1497993650,ICO Blues: Status Raises $64 Million (So Far) But Leaves Buyers Waiting,"An ethereum-based messaging app held an initial coin offering today, drawing in more than $50m worth of the cryptocurrency ether – as well as broad complaints from would-be investors.  At press time, the team behind Status, which is developing a mobile-based messenger and browser app, had raised 182,000 ETH – an amount worth roughly $64m in ether at current market prices.  Network data  points to the creation of approximately 1.63bn tokens, with sales drawn from 3,341 accounts on the ethereum network.  Yet the sale quickly ran into headwinds as users began sending transactions to the announced smart contract address before it began. That backlog accelerated as more users tried to purchase tokens, triggering reports of failed transactions and accusations that the sale itself was flawed from the start.  But it wasn't just the network itself that got bogged down, according to posts on social media.  Wallet service MyEtherWallet saw a big uptick in activity, posting a notice to its website (since removed) that stated ""if your [transaction] is not urgent, we recommend NOT SENDING TODAY"".  Etherscan  , a popular ethereum blockchain explorer, had to switch traffic to a backup site amid what founder Matthew Tan‏ called ""the mania"" among buyers.  History repeats?  The rush to invest and the subsequent network congestion problems have become common themes in recent ethereum-based token sales.  As the concept has gained market traction in recent months, the ICO model has been hailed by some as a novel way for startups to raise funds, while critics have argued it exposes investors to the potential for fraud in a regulatory gray area.  The raise comes just days after another ethereum-based project, Bancor, raised more than $150m at then-current prices in what was the largest coin offering to date. Like with Status, congestion quickly became a problem on the ethereum network, sparking complaints and criticism from would-be investors.  Another sale, held by browser startup Brave, collected $35m in a matter of seconds late last month. That sale, too, attracted criticism among those who were unable to purchase tokens given the lightning-fast completion.

The IBI Hack, a month-long virtual hackathon set to begin on 1st July, is being organized by the Illinois Blockchain Initiative along with blockchain technology startup Fulcrum. The event is open to students and recent university graduates from around the world, with all entries due on 31st July.  IBI Hack is part of the Illinois Blockchain Month, a month-long initiative that will see a series of educational events hosted across the state focused on the tech. The events are aimed at trying to teach people what blockchains are and what they can do.  State governor Bruce Rauner said in a statement:  ""Illinois is the state of innovation, and I am proud to see our young men and women getting involved in the Illinois Blockchain Initiative Hack. Empowering our youth is empowering the future of Illinois.""  The Illinois Blockchain Initiative was unveiled in November as part of a wide-ranging effort among state officials to tap the tech for public-sector applications. The initiative is backed by a number of state agencies, including the Cook County Registry of Deeds, which had previously looked at the concept of time-stamping documents with the bitcoin blockchain.  The hackathon represents the latest development in the blockchain experiments at the state of Illinois. Two weeks ago, several of Chicago’s largest enterprises have joined forces with the state government to launch a new blockchain center. In March, Illinois joined R3, the distributed ledger consortium that includes dozens of banks worldwide.

The blockchain firm is working with Risk Cooperative to expand the tech's footprint in the insurance sector, with a particular focus on brokers and other intermediaries who sit between insurers and their customers.  Announced last week, the partnership will see Risk Cooperative leveraging its relationships in the insurance space as part of that bid to push for blockchain applications. According to its website, Risk Cooperative works with Aetna, one of the largest US health insurers.  Dante Disparte, Risk Cooperative’s founder and CEO, sees the deal as positioning his firm as one of the ""first movers"" in this area, remarking:  “With Bitfury as a strategic partner, combined with our commitment to innovation and improving resilience, we are confident that we can serve as first movers in driving Blockchain’s adoption across the entire insurance value chain. This is no small feat, but with Bitfury’s strategic and operational leadership in Blockchain technology, we can be bold in our advance.  The partnership represents the latest development at the intersection of insurance providers and blockchain tech.  Last week, insurance giant American International Group (AIG) and UK-based bank Standard Chartered announced the completion of a blockchain pilot focused on commercial insurance policies.  In April, a group of insurance firms announced that they had completed work on a blockchain trial in China.

42400061,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzVmZ,1497968142,India Inches Closer to Developing Cryptocurrency Rules,"India's government is reportedly moving closer to developing regulations around cryptocurrencies.  Local news outlet MoneyControl reports that officials with the country's central bank, as well as its top finance regulators, are finalizing a report which lays out possible approaches for overseeing the tech.  Agencies involved in the development reportedly include the Reserve Bank of India as well as the Ministry of Revenue, Department of Financial Services and the Department of Economic Affairs.  What's happening: The report being developed could be as released as late next month, according to MoneyControl.  Up for continued discussion is precisely how to approach regulation in India, including the question of whether a dedicated agency is needed for the job.  ""SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India) can be asked to regulate virtual currencies as transactions are currently done through unregulated exchanges. RBI may step in if the government plans to regulate them or accept them as currency,"" an unnamed official told the publication.  How we got here: As CoinDesk reported in April, regulators are weighing the issue through the lens of consumer protection and combatting money laundering.  In May, the Indian government opened the process to public input as it moved ahead with its discussions. According to the MyGov site, nearly 4,000 comments were submitted in recent weeks.  During that time, digital currency startups in India spoke out about the process, calling on government officials to pursue an inclusive approach.  ""We request the committee to give us an opportunity to meet them and showcase the benefits of this technology for our country,"" the Digital Asset and Blockchain Foundation of India said in a statement at the time.

Issued as part of a broader annual report to the state's governor and legislature, the NYDFS provided a brief description of its overall activities, emphasizing what it believes is the continued need for oversight on the industry due to the increased ""speed of transactions"" that blockchain technologies enable.  Notably, the finance department also revealed that it has begun to inspect the operations of digital currency startups serving customers in the state.  The filing reads:  ""DFS has begun examinations of these virtual currency companies, which, like other regulated financial services entities, are subject to periodic examinations by DFS.""  As part of a 2015 law, digital currency startups must agree to examinations conducted at least once every two years. Such examinations enable the regulator to inspect ""books, records, accounts, documents"" and other company items, per the final text.  Elsewhere, the NYDFS noted that it has now licensed five virtual currency companies.

42400053,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzTH7,1497960064,UN Leaders Urge Blockchain Startups to Collaborate on Identity,"Offering the United Nations a blockchain ""silver bullet"" is not the best way to work with the global organization, according to the lead electoral advisor at the UN Development Programme (UNDP).  Instead of pitching their product as a panacea to solve all the world's problems, startups working with blockchain and other technologies to improve digital identities need to begin to view their solutions as part of a collective good, according to Niall McCann, speaking yesterday at the UN's ID2020 event on the future of identity.  Addressing a group of about 500 employees of governments, non-profits and corporations, McCann riveted the audience with his call for inter-agency cooperation, as well as cooperation between blockchain startups and other innovators, to better serve the estimated 1.5 billion people globally that do not have legal identities.  McCann said:  ""If the private tech sector could collectively work with the UN and collectively go together, I think we can solve that problem.""  Specifically, McCann mentioned a digital identity management project the UNDP had ""just started"", which he said could be implemented by national governments.  Though he didn't mention whether the project specifically employs blockchain tech, McCann included blockchain startups among those he encouraged to take a collective approach.  ""We need the private sector to be part of this project,"" he said.  Echoing McCann's remarks, Atefeh Riazi, chief information officer of the UN, also called for the tech sector to work more closely together and with her organization.  ""Here at the UN, we invite you to partner with us and to partner with each other in a way that we can make sustainable development goals,"" Riazi said.  Bigger than an agency  In April, CoinDesk first reported that the UNDP organization with which McCann works was one of seven UN agencies exploring blockchain. Since then, several other UN agencies have joined a working group aimed at helping agencies that might otherwise compete for resources to share what they’ve learned about blockchain and use cases such as identity.  Throughout the one-day event, speakers covered a wide range of potential identity solutions that could help the UN and the governments that comprise the organization.  Following a presentation by Accenture's capital markets blockchain global lead, David Treat, who demoed a new identity solution that uses blockchain, Microsoft’s global business strategist in charge of blockchain, Yorke Rhodes, announced the launch of the ID2020 Alliance – a group of firms and organizations that will work to bring a ""safe, verifiable and persistent digital identification system to scale"".  In spite of a diverse set of possible solutions discussed at the event, the general consensus was that, regardless of which platform is finally used by various UN agencies and their member states, the final owner of the data should be the recipients of the aid.  That's opposed to a model being employed by many tech companies that give away their services for free but profit by selling access to their users profiles, according to Karl Steinacker, the nation of Niger's representative for the UN's refugee agency, UNHCR.  Steinacker said that the UNHCR's new high commissioner, Filippo Grandi, has been ""very clear"" that data held on refugees should be owned by the refugees and should be used for their empowerment.  He continued:  ""So that is the line on which we are now working ... that the subjects of the data should own the data.""  Is simpler better?  Still, other speakers made clear that the ability to identify those in need of the UN's help – and distribute those resources – might not require advanced technological solutions.  Joseph Leenhouts Martin, head of innovation at Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, said the simplest solution might provide the best service.  ""When we talk about technology and innovation, we always talk about what’s the new thing, what’s the big idea,"" Martin said, concluding:  ""I’m here to tell you that sometimes the simpler idea is the best idea and we need to be open to that way of thinking.""

42400037,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzT7H,1497956434,Too Easy? Critics Take Aim at Ethereum Token Standard Amid ICO Boom,"It's hard not to be taken aback by the amount of money consumers have been throwing at initial coin offerings (ICOs) lately.  The new fundraising model allows developers to sell digital 'tokens' to raise money for decentralized projects. Two recent events highlight why there may be cause for concern.  Earlier this month, web browser startup Brave made $35m in seconds selling its basic attention token (BAT). And, soon after, a relative unknown called Bancor pulled in $150m in hours – the largest ICO in history – despite claims about possibly sketchy code underlying the project.  Like the majority of recent ICOs, these projects were both built on the ethereum blockchain, and they were both selling ERC-20 tokens. ERC-20 is a standard that allows a variety of tokens to interface with wallets, exchanges and other smart contracts in a common way.  Yet, while standards exist for good reason, some believe, when combined with a lack of regulation in the space, ERC-20 may be making it too easy for unscrupulous projects to get into the game.  History lesson  ICOs are nothing new.  The first was completed in July 2013 when Mastercoin (now Omni) raised over $600,000 in bitcoin to fund an effort to build a protocol layer on top of the bitcoin blockchain.  The next big ICO was in April 2014, when the ethereum project was announced. At that time, ethereum sold 50 million ether (its native currency) to raise $18m in bitcoin. Ethereum went live in July the following year.  Once ethereum was off and running, its developers came up with a way for those building decentralized apps on the network to create 'custom' tokens to fund their projects. Investors could then buy these tokens with ether and later trade them on exchanges.  One of the more infamous crowdsales to come out of that was The DAO (short for decentralized autonomous organization). The project, which launched in April 2016, quickly sold $150m-worth of tokens. Two months later, due to a weakness in its smart contract code, the DAO was hacked to the tune of $50m. As a result, the network was forked and the money was eventually returned to the original investors.  Despite that bump in the road, ethereum recovered. And since then, ICO activity has gained steam. So far in 2017, blockchain entrepreneurs have raised $327m through ICO offerings (not including the $150m from Bancor), far exceeding traditional VC funding in the space over the same period. The huge spike in ICO activity coincides with the introduction of ERC-20.  The question is, however, are these ERC-20 tokens really custom tokens at all?  Copy-and-paste solution  Introduced in November 2015, ERC-20 spells out a set of rules that allow tokens to behave in a common and predictable way.  Put simply, that means any ERC-20 token will work with ethereum wallets off the bat. And because exchanges already know how these tokens operate, they can easily integrate them. This means, depending on any restrictions put on the tokens by the ICO, in many cases, those tokens can be traded immediately.  Yet, while ERC-20 spells out the rules for how a token should operate, it does not include the code. Even so, that can easily be found in a public Github repository such as Open Zeppelin.  By copying and pasting that code, anyone with a modicum of programming experience can produce an ERC-20 token in minutes. Shlomi Zeltsinger, a blockchain consultant and ethereum coder, who spoke to CoinDesk, demonstrates how it's done in his YouTube tutorials.  Zeltsinger feels most people do not realize how easy these tokens are to generate. Many ICO projects simply re-use this generic code, he said, while inputting variables, like the token name, the token symbol, how many tokens 1 ETC will buy, total supply, and so on.  The rest is simple, too. When an investor wants to buy tokens during an ICO, they send ether from any ethereum wallet to the token's contract address. Those tokens can then be traded on any third-party exchange that agrees to support them.  What about the app?  But the problem is, while many of the ICO projects built on ethereum have professional developer teams behind them, the vast majority do not, Zeltsinger alleged.  He claimed many projects are putting on a song and dance, giving investors the impression that the token they are selling is an integral part of a working, or almost working, smart contract. But this is often far from the truth, he said.  And what buyers do not realize is, in most cases, what they are buying is nothing more than a number on a spreadsheet managed by that token's smart contract. In fact, after researching ICOs on TokenMarket, a website that tracks ICOs, Zeltsinger found the code underlying a substantial number of those contained nothing more than that spreadsheet.  Arguing projects should be more upfront about what they offering, he said:  ""Every ICO that uses a simple ERC-20 base code to raise funds needs to say out loud, 'Listen, we are just raising money. Those tokens will not be used in the application – maybe in the future we will find a way to make something cool with them but they are not for the application right now.'""  Likely, though, the situation will not change until more regulations and oversight kicks in. At least, that is how Emin Gün Sirer, a Cornell associate professor and researcher in cryptocurrencies and smart contracts, sees it.  And, while Sirer agrees some projects are ""clear scams,"" he feels that others are ""honest attempts to tokenize or integrate or market some new function."" To him, there is no one entity to blame. The ethereum network and ERC-20 are simply tools, much like the internet.  But if things continue in the direction they are going, it may be the market is headed for a massive correction. Or, as ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin tweeted:  ""There's no 'cure' for bubbles except to let them run their course and pop, unfortunately.""

Announced earlier this month, Nomura Holdings, Daiwa Securities, Mizuho Financial Group and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation used distributed ledger startup R3's Corda software to streamline an ISDA Master Agreement negotiation.  Published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA), the agreement is intended for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives transactions internationally. The framework traditionally requires each party involved in the transaction to record and store the emails and documentations that are produced in internal coordination and external negotiation.  According to a statement, using the prototype, each time a transaction is recorded, the terms of the master agreement will apply automatically and do not need to be renegotiated, thus improving transparency and simplifying data management.  Mizuho Bank, Daiwa Securities Group and Nomura Holdings, previously joined a blockchain consortium formed by the Japan Exchange Group (JPX) last November, with a goal of testing a blockchain-based market infrastructure proof-of-concept. The project now has 26 members, including several key regulators such as Japans's central bank and the Financial Service Agency, the country's top markets watchdog.  Developed by R3, a consortium of global financial institutions, Corda is a distributed ledger platform providing APIs and codes for companies to build up blockchain-like applications.

42400038,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzT6I,1497949219,IMF Explores ICOs and Central Bank Coins in New Blockchain Note,"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is continuing to explore the potential of digital currencies and distributed ledger technology (DLT) .  In a staff discussion note released this week, entitled ""Fintech and Financial Services: Initial Considerations"", the IMF places an emphasis on two impact areas: the use of the technology for cross-border payments and its potential to be leveraged as part of a central bank-backed digital currency.  The first note published by the IMF this year, it follows in the footsteps of a similar publication issued last January. As such, this paper touches on many familiar topics and themes, including how the technology could come to bring change to financial services.  Still, while familiar topics including the impact of permissioned and permissionless versions of the technology perhaps saw the most airtime, newer concepts are touched on for the first time as well.  In particular, the IMF hints at how blockchain-based 'digital tokens' are now being used to represent securities and ownership rights through so-called initial coin offerings (ICOs), though it stops short of any formal statements on the matter.  The paper reads:  ""The legal status of a digital token, and the legal effect of its transfer are not clear. For example, would the transfer of an asset-backed token (eg, representing a security) on a ledger transfer legal ownership of the security or would registration outside the ledger (eg, in a corporate share registry) still be required?""  The IMF goes on to speculate that answers to these questions would likely vary by country and jurisdiction, but that the question of how such uses of the technology will be regulated is likely to be on the minds of policymakers in the years ahead.  The discussion note was co-authored by nine IMF staff members, including Dong He, deputy director of IMF's Monetary and Capital Markets Department.  Central bank coins  Other major 2017 trends see discussion too, including the increasing activity in the sector of global central banks. Encouraged by the developments in DLT, central banks including Bank of Russia, Bank of India, and The Monetary Authority of Singapore are researching and experimenting with the possibility of a central bank-issued digital currency.  As a result, the IMF paper considers two questions regarding the prospect: ""Why would a central bank want to issue a digital currency?"" and ""What form could such a currency take and how would it be distributed?"".  Overall, there are two main reasons for issuing a central bank-backed digital currency, the paper states, the first of which is that it could improve the institution's operations.  ""Introducing a CBDC may allow the central bank to perform its role in insuring an effective payments infrastructure, including the issuance of currency and the provision of a lender of last resort function, more efficiently,"" the paper reads.  In addition, the paper speculates that such innovations could leverage central bank networks more defensively as a means of warding off innovation:  ""The introduction and potential proliferation of private virtual currencies might, in one view, threaten to erode the demand for central bank money and the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. A CBDC may forestall such private virtual currencies or relegate them to a secondary role in the payments system.""  Ripe for change  Elsewhere, the paper points out that the area of cross-border payments is especially ripe for change, and could benefit from such new technologies.  It argues that the model of cross-border payments services today exhibits significant shortcomings, outlining how various stakeholders engage with consumers today. Different from domestic payments, which are settled by domestic banks and central banks, cross-border payments usually require ad-hoc arrangements, often between commercial banks.  As such, the authors argue that blockchain and DLT could bring an internet-like upheaval to how this process is conducted.

42400041,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzTAE,1497945616,Blockchain Comes to East London With Colu Local Currency Launch,"A new cryptocurrency is coming to east London.  Launched by Israel-based blockchain startup Colu, the 'Local Pound, East London' currency is now available for area consumers and small businesses who want to boost the local economy. The digital currency is tied one-to-one to the national currency, the British pound, and can be bought with cards and bank accounts.  According to Colu co-founder and vice president, Mark Smargon, Colu's currencies are an attempt to combat the threat of retail chains in cities and neighborhoods, while the accompanying app is meant to help businesses manage their transactions and help locals discover merchants in their area.  In this context, the startup's local digital currencies are trying to remove technical barriers for local businesses when it comes to paperless transactions.  Smargon told CoinDesk:  ""The local businesses are not really interacting with blockchain knowingly. The idea of selling blockchain to consumers and small businesses is not something we are doing.""  The company has launched services in Liverpool and Tel Aviv, where it also has its operations. The Liverpool currency, which went live in late 2016, has around 16,000 users and merchants on the network.  Future ambitions  Going forward, Colu plans to build out more features as the communities around the local currencies grow.  ""We started on a very small scale, on a neighborhood scale, and right now we're working on a city scale,"" said Smargon. ""We merged all of our communities in Tel Aviv into one big Tel Aviv coin.""  One possible feature in the pipeline is allowing Colu local currencies to be interchangeable with more widely known cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin and ether. Though, Smargon said this could be some way off.  ""Right now, we're not focusing on opening new economies but building the retention,"" he said, adding that its various currencies have about 50,000 users and carried out $1m worth of transactions.  The company is now in the process of applying for an e-money license in the UK to bolster its digital currency development.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Colu.
