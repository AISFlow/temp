42407615,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga0C78,1726527660,"UK Finance, Member Banks See Benefits During Experimental Phase of a Tokenization, CBDC Platform","U.K. Finance alongside 11 of its members completed the experimental phase of a tokenization and CBDC platform.  The program identified improvements in economic value and enhanced functionality.  Trade association U.K. Finance said it completed the experimental phase of a tokenization and central bank digital currency (CBDC) platform and is looking to work with regulators and other public bodies on developing payment networks based on the technology.  Involving 11 member banks, including Barclays, Citi UK, HSBC and Natwest, as well as professional service firms, the program concluded that such a platform would help deliver economic value and could enable new functionality such as programmable payments.  The Regulated Liability Network is a financial market infrastructure “that can deliver new capabilities for payments and settlement, including tokenization and programmability,” U.K. Finance said in a statement.  An increasing number of platforms and institutions are exploring tokenization, the process of bringing real-world assets including securities like stocks on-chain. Last year, U.K. regulator the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said it supported industry leaders' report on the implementation of fund tokenization. The newly elected Labour government set out a policy aim for the country to become a securities tokenization hub earlier this year in the run up to the general election.  “Working in partnership, we have demonstrated how this platform supports developments in money and payments aligned to common public and private sector objectives, while also providing clear and long-term customer and industry benefits,” Peter Left, co-chair of the RLN Project, said in the statement.  The core of the platform comprised a multi-issuer tokenization platform that facilitated the issuance of tokenized commercial bank deposits plus simulated a wholesale CBDC – a digital token issued by a central bank for institutions, not retail users. It also included an application program interface (API) layer that enabled interoperability across all forms of money and existing ledgers.  “The legal and regulatory framework of the U.K. is sufficiently flexible to support the implementation of a ‘platform for innovation’, subject to further implementation and regulatory engagement,” the organization said.

33664777,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=642330,1726525816,"61% Of Ethereum Holders Are Profitable But ETH Bulls Must Hold $2,290","Ethereum is wavy when writing as bulls struggle to build momentum and push the coin above the immediate resistance levels at around $2,400 and $2,800. Even so, most ETH holders are upbeat, expecting prices to turn around the corner and soar, even breaking above July highs of around $3,500. 61% Of ETH Holders In The Money Amid this development and the general lull, IntoTheBlock data shows that 61% of all ETH holders are in the money. That over 50% of all ETH holders are in green despite the coin shedding nearly 35% from July highs and nearly 45% from 2024 highs points to resilience, especially in the face of determined bears. Related Reading: Glassnode Founders Say Bitcoin Crash To $37,000 Wouldn’t Be A Bad Thing, Here’s Why Technically, the resilience among ETH holders indicates a wave of optimism sweeping through its ecosystem. According to IntoTheBlock, this development means that at current levels, more ETH holders are making money, way higher than in bear market cycles. Then, profitability tends to fall drastically. For context, IntoTheBlock analysts note that during the 2019/2020 period, when prices fell, the percentage of profitable holders at one point dropped to as low as 10%. Additionally, in the last bear run, the percentage of ETH holders making money fell to 46%. However, this was way higher than the 3% when ETH prices dumped to as low as 3% in the depth of the 2018 bear run. Ethereum Holders Confident, Support Lies At $2,290 And $2,360 ETH’s profitability percentage has evolved over the years, pointing to a maturing market where holders are still confident about what lies ahead. According to Dune data, there are 128,804,395 ETH in the circulating supply. Out of this, the top 1,000 addresses control over 49.1 million or 38.15%. If IntoTheBlock data is anything to go by, most of these whales are in the green, making money. Accordingly, they won’t be incentivized to sell, increasing pressure on ETH. Related Reading: Solana Losses Ground, Drops Below $137 As Bearish Momentum Builds Looking closer at on-chain data, one analyst notes that ETH has a critical support at between $2,290 and $2,360. In this zone, nearly 1.9 million addresses were bought and currently hold approximately 52.3 million ETH. Millions of ETH were bought at this level, meaning it is a critical loading zone. If broken, the analyst predicts sharp losses that will drop the coin below August lows to $1,800 in a bear trend continuation formation.

When someone registers using your referral code, both you and the person you referred can receive rewards, which may include discounts on trading fees or other bonuses, depending on Binance’s current referral program. The referral code is typically a string of letters and numbers, like VA05III2 , that you can share with friends, family, or followers. If the person signs up and uses the platform, you’ll receive a percentage of their trading fees as a reward, and they might also get a discount on their fees.

The deposit was made using a third-party payment method or internal transfer, which are not eligible. The deposit was not completed within the 14-day window after registration or did not exceed $50. The referred friend failed to pass Binance’s risk assessment checks. Binance reserves the right to revoke rewards if dishonest or abusive activities are detected. How can I use the Binance Referral Trading Fee Rebate Voucher? After receiving the voucher, go to the Rewards Hub to redeem it within 7 days.

Over the past five months, Dogecoin has largely traded in a downtrend with the formation of lower highs and lower lows. This consistent downward pressure has led to the development of a classic price pattern known as a falling wedge. According to a technical analyst who has been closely tracking Dogecoin’s movements, the daily chart suggests that the falling wedge is nearing its conclusion, and a bullish breakout is now in sight. If Dogecoin successfully breaks out of this wedge, the analyst projects a price target of $0.20. Dogecoin Falling Wedge Breaking Bullish A falling wedge is a narrowing price channel that typically signals a reversal from bearish to bullish momentum. The key feature of this pattern is that it shows a gradual reduction in the downward price movement as buyers start to step in, causing price consolidation. In the case of Dogecoin, this pattern was highlighted by a technical analyst known pseudonymously as Crypto Yapper on social media platform X. Related Reading: Analyst Sounds Warning For Bullish Investors, Says Solana Will Crash 42% To $80 According to the DOGE/USDT chart on the 1D candlestick, DOGE has largely been on a downtrend since it peaked at its yearly high of $0.22 in March. At one point, DOGE fell by 63% from $0.22 to a low of $0.08 on August 5. Following this low point in early August, Dogecoin has managed to stage a modest recovery, rising by approximately 25% to its current level. However, DOGE has yet to break above the upper resistance trendline of the falling wedge pattern. $DOGE almost Breaking Out ! This Falling Wedge on the #DOGE daily chart is close to breaking Bullish The break out target for #Dogecoin will be $0.20 pic.twitter.com/MoAQe1Xo6r — Crypto Yapper (@CryptoYapper) September 14, 2024 Since bouncing off $0.088 on September 6, DOGE has traveled upwards to retest the upper trendline of the falling wedge at around $0.108. As noted by Crypto Yapper, a successful break to the upside would see DOGE doubling its current value and reaching $0.20. While this price target might seem modest at first glance, especially considering that Dogecoin had already surpassed $0.20 earlier in the year, it represents the cryptocurrency’s recovery from its prolonged downtrend. This, in turn, could lead to a total change into bullish sentiment, with DOGE eventually breaking above $0.22. Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin Will Reach $68,000 By End Of September, $90,000 In December Echoing the falling wedge pattern analysis is another DOGE trader (CryptoHotep).

This comment was made regarding a forecasted breakout above the upper trendline. Although there wasn’t a projected price target, his comment showed this is probably the best time to buy DOGE before the projected breakout.

42407608,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga0Bqb,1726520355,Another Bitcoin Miner Adopts MicroStrategy's Playbook of Buying BTC in Open Market,"Cathedra Bitcoin will pivot away from Bitcoin mining to providing general data center services and buying Bitcoin on the open market instead, the company said.  Cathedra cited unpredictable profit margins as a cause for the shift.  It was Michael Saylor whose MicroStrategy championed large corporations buying bitcoin {{BTC}} on the open market. Then, surprisingly, one of the biggest bitcoin mining firms, Marathon Digital (MARA), adopted the same strategy. And now another miner is following the same path.  Cathedra Bitcoin (CBIT), a firm that started as a miner, said it's changing its business model to develop data centers and will use profits from that business to buy bitcoin instead of mining it. ""The last three years have demonstrated to us that bitcoin mining is not a reliable way to grow shareholders’ bitcoin per share,"" the company said in a statement, noting that the firm's primary goal is to accumulate bitcoin for the shareholders.  Read more: Bitcoin Mining Is So Rough a Miner Adopted Michael Saylor's Successful BTC Strategy  During the 2021 bull run, mining was seen as a better way to accumulate bitcoin at a discounted price than the open market due to high-profit margins and relatively low hurdle to start the business. That all changed after the recent crypto winter, approval of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to be traded in the U.S. and the halving – which cut the rewards in half, making mining even more competitive.  The miners are now struggling to stay afloat and accumulate bitcoin at a discounted price, while other public companies, such as MicroStrategy's (MSTR), are getting rewarded by investors for buying bitcoin in the open market.  ""Indeed, nine of the 10 largest (by market capitalization) publicly listed bitcoin mining companies hold less bitcoin per share today than they did three years ago. And as a bitcoin miner ourselves, Cathedra has not fared better by this metric. Meanwhile, other listed companies have adopted an explicit policy of increasing bitcoin per share, most notably MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR), and have been rewarded by equity markets,"" Cathedra wrote.  The company said it will now pivot to developing and operating data centers, which have more predictable cash flows. The firm will then use the profits generated from that business to buy bitcoin in the open market. In fact, it recently merged with Kungsleden, a developer and operator of alternative high-density compute infrastructure, to achieve this goal.  Additionally, the company will use other options such as debt, equity and bitcoin-linked derivatives to generate funds to buy more bitcoin. Currently, Cathedra holds 43 bitcoin on its balance sheet.  While the company said it's not entirely ditching the mining business and will continue to retain bitcoin mined from its existing operations, it's not hard to see why it pivoted to such a business model. Most recently, bitcoin miner Core Scientific (CORZ) and data center firm Applied Digital (APLD) shares surged after they announced diversifying into high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI) hosting business.  Meanwhile, stock prices of other miners that haven't committed fully to HCP or AI computing business keep getting pressured as the network hashrate, or a measure of competitiveness, continues to rise to all-time highs, while profitability falls.  JPMorgan recently said the hashprice, a measure of miner's daily profitability, has fallen 2% this month, and is more than 50% below pre-halving levels. Meanwhile, Jefferies said bitcoin mining was notably less profitable in August than in July, and September is shaping up to be another difficult month due to rising hashrate.  ""By repositioning the company away from the bitcoin mining business, toward one with more predictable cash flows and which generates attractive returns on capital – developing and operating data centers – we believe our recent merger with Kungsleden will enable Cathedra to generate meaningful growth in bitcoin per share over time,"" Cathedra said in the statement.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Aoyon Ashraf,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/09/16/another-bitcoin-miner-adopts-microstrategys-playbook-of-buying-btc-in-open-market,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8a2e8e80dbdd3551c177996bf7e2faba468d8296-1108x623.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The remainder of the money could be used to buy additional bitcoin.  Nasdaq-listed bitcoin development firm MicroStrategy (MSTR) announced Monday that it intends to offer $700 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2028.  The company plans to use the proceeds of the offering to redeem $500 million worth of senior secured notes with 6.125% annual yield maturing in 2028, the press release said. It will use the rest of the proceeds to purchase more bitcoin {{BTC}} and for general corporate uses.  The firm also plans to grant to the initial purchasers of the notes an option to buy up to an additional $105 million aggregate principal amount of notes within a 13-day period starting on the issuance date of the first notes. The company said it may redeem for cash all or a portion of the notes on or after December 20, 2027, subject to certain conditions.  The company, led by Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, started purchasing bitcoin in 2020, adopting it as a reserve asset for its treasury. Since then, it has become the largest corporate buyer of bitcoin, accumulating 244,800 BTC, worth roughly $14.2 billion at current prices. Only days ago, MicroStrategy disclosed the purchase of an additional $1.1 billion worth of bitcoin, leaving it with $900 million available under a previous offering.

The pessimism surrounding RIOT could derived from its underperformance in operating cost efficiency; if this is true, the prospect of RIOT operating at full capacity will positively change its outlook. RIOT's acquisition of BITF makes sense as BITF helps RIOT diversify its operations away from curtailment-prone Texas, but limited benefits can be derived due to BITF's scale and % ownership. We think that the likelihood of RIOT operating at full capacity is low given it is systematic to Texas, putting our thesis into question: Will RIOT ever operate at full capacity? Introduction At the time of writing, RIOT's valuation is likely attracting significant attention. Not only is it trading below book value, but it is priced at half the sector average Price-to-book value ('PBR') (Fig A). Riot Platforms is currently trading at $1.9bn, while its liquidation value (based on our terms: tangible assets + deposits - total liability) is worth $2.16bn. That's ~10% below the liquidation price. Fig 0. PBR of major Bitcoin mining companies (Author) This excites us because instances of a Bitcoin miner trading below liquidation value are rare when the crypto market is expecting a bull run anytime soon. We found several deals like this during the bear market or the recovery phase, such as Iris Energy Limited ( IREN ) back then, but rarely in a bull market. In this article, we identified a situation where RIOT could rank high on our watch list as we prepare for a potential Bitcoin USD ( BTC-USD ) bull run in about 1 month. RIOT At Full Throttle We have always found it difficult to justify an investment in RIOT because of its cost basis, making it very unprofitable. Referring to Fig 1, it is observable that RIOT spends the majority of the time having the highest all-in cost basis per Bitcoin mined. Note that even the historic amount of curtailment credits received isn't enough to revert it back to the sector mean. Our previous thesis , based on 2023Q3, concluded that RIOT could mirror Core Scientific, Inc. ( CORZ ) as it aims to expand ambitiously to 100 EH/s despite being unprofitable (due to a high all-in cost basis). However, the recent 2024Q2 earnings report changed our perspective on RIOT's operating efficiency, and thus, the entire outlook of RIOT. Fig 1. All-in cost basis per Bitcoin of major bitcoin miners. (Author) Firstly, a portion of RIOT's high-cost basis can be explained by its aggressive depreciation of Bitcoin mining fleets. Since our early coverage, we've assumed a 5-year useful life for the mining fleet, whereas RIOT had assumed only 2 years. Recently, RIOT extended the expected useful life of its fleets from 2 to 3 years which helped minimize the accounting depreciation cost. This cost can further be reduced if RIOT adopts the same 5-year useful life. Effective January 1, 2024, the Company changed the estimated useful life of its miners and mining equipment from 2 years to 3 years. Depreciation and amortization for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, were $32.3 million and $59.3 million, respectively, a decrease of approximately $27.0 million. The decrease was primarily due to the change in the estimated lives of our Bitcoin miners from 2 years to 3 years. Since depreciation is subject to different accounting methods, and we're unable to adjust them for a fair comparison, we'll omit depreciation cost during comps. This is justifiable because the total depreciable costs are generally similar across Bitcoin mining companies. For instance, RIOT and CLSK 's purchase costs are $16 million per 1 EH/s. Hence, the depreciable cost is also capped at $16mil per 1 EH/s. Hence, only the rate of depreciation should differ. Secondly, we observed that RIOT's variable cost component (cost of revenue per Bitcoin) closely tracks the sector average. In contrast, its fixed cost components-such as SG&A, SBCs, and professional fees-remain elevated. This suggests that RIOT may not suffer from operational cost inefficiencies, and its challenges likely lie elsewhere. Fig 4. Cost of Revenue per Bitcoin of Major Bitcoin Miners (Author) Fig 5. SG&A (fixed cost component) per Bitcoin of major Bitcoin miners (Author) SG&A typically consists of human capital-related expenses. Since Bitcoin mining companies are like factories, higher-than-sector SG&A suggests 2 potential causes: either RIOT's team is oversized for its operational capacity, or RIOT is not operating at full capacity. Our findings point to the latter. Fig 6 illustrates major Bitcoin miners' capacity utility rate (the ratio between the monthly average operating and deployed hash rates). By referring to it, we can see that RIOT is operating below its full capacity. This implies that RIOT has to incur the fixed costs (such as more human resources, depreciation costs, etc.) of having a higher capacity ( 23.3 EH/s ) but produce Bitcoin with 15.5 EH/s capacity. Knowing this, when assuming RIOT's full capacity, RIOT's fixed cost component (SG&A) now falls to the sector average (Fig 7). This also caused RIOT's total all-in cost basis to fall to the sector average cost basis (Fig 8). Therefore, it is reasonable to expect RIOT's cost basis to recover when it operates at full capacity. Fig 6. Capacity Utility Rate of major Bitcoin miners (Author) Fig 7. SG&A (fixed cost component) per Bitcoin of major Bitcoin miners, assuming RIOT at full capacity (Author) Fig 8. All-in cost basis per Bitcoin of major bitcoin miners. (with RIOT at full capacity, represented by ---Dotted Line) (Author) How Acquisition of BITF Helps RIOT's Cost Basis Given the context we provided throughout the article, RIOT's acquisition of BITF makes sense. RIOT disclosed how the acquisition of BITF is compelling for both parties. Among the key benefits, we think ""geographical diversification"" ranks at the top because it can help RIOT improve the capacity utility rate. A large portion of RIOT's operations is in Texas, which is prone to curtailment. We think it is a 'systematic risk' (unavoidable) because MARA also faces curtailment issues (We covered it in detail here ). Although RIOT receives curtailment credits, we think that it is more profitable to operate at full capacity than to rely on curtailment credits. For instance, in July , RIOT averaged an operating hash rate of 15.5 EH/s, short of 8 EH/s from its full capacity. At that capacity, RIOT produced 370 Bitcoins, which implies 23.9 Bitcoins per 1 EH/s. At full capacity, RIOT could've earned 191 more Bitcoins, which are worth $11 million at $60k per Bitcoin, which is 3x more of the credits it received. Considering BITF mining sites are diversified and outside of Texas and Kentucky, BITF's stable uptime can improve RIOT's overall capacity utility rate, which improves cost basis and overall profitability. Not to mention, BITF's valuation (based on Implied Bitcoin Price ('IBP') without depreciation) is also the lowest, making this acquisition strategic from both an operational and valuation standpoint. Company BITF CLSK IREN MARA RIOT IBP w/o Depr 41,995 71,188 87,431 94,748 81,669 Verdict We speculate that the pessimism surrounding RIOT is related to its all-in cost basis being the worst in the sector by a margin (Fig 1). While the actual reasons for RIOT's falling out of favor with the market remain unclear to us, we are reasonably confident that RIOT offers significant upside potential if it can operate at full capacity, especially at its current valuations. This is because the profitability outlook of RIOT operating at full capacity is very attractive, rivalling even CLSK (Fig 8). Currently, there's also an ongoing mean reversion in the Bitcoin mining sector, where the PBRs of Bitcoin mining companies are converging around the 2.3 PBR level. RIOT is the only remaining Bitcoin mining company yet to revert. If RIOT reverts, it could present investors with a 2x return (assuming constant book value and sector-average PBR). Combining the prospects of RIOT achieving profitability (at full capacity), RIOT's current valuation (below book value and half the sector's PBR), and the ongoing mean reversion, RIOT looks really attractive. That being said, we lack confidence that RIOT can improve its capacity utilization rate in a short period of time, even after the acquisition of BITF. Recently, RIOT experienced another decline in its average operating hash rate in August, highlighting a significant challenge. Furthermore, RIOT currently only owns 20% of BITF while BITF's capacity is half that of RIOT. Therefore, the positive impact that can be derived from the acquisition is expected to be limited. If our speculation holds, it implies that RIOT may not even return to the sector mean. This uncertainty calls our entire investment thesis for RIOT into question: Will RIOT ever operate at full capacity? As we prepare for a potential Bitcoin bull run by October 17th, we believe it's unlikely that RIOT can make significant operational improvements within a short, one-month period. For now, RIOT will remain on our watch list, with potential catalysts to monitor.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4721426-riot-platforms-offers-asymmetric-upside-potential-at-full-capacity?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/33661439.jpeg

The meme coin recently broke out of a monthly downtrend that has kept its price suppressed since late March, signaling a potential shift in momentum. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts AVAX Breakout: Is $30 The Next Target? Analysts and investors are growing increasingly optimistic about DOGE’s latest price action, with some predicting that if Dogecoin breaks above the $0.12 mark, it could trigger a larger rally in the meme coin space. However, the next few days will be critical in determining whether DOGE can lead this rally or if it will need a period of consolidation before pushing higher. As the broader crypto market looks for direction, all eyes are on Dogecoin to see if it can capitalize on this positive momentum and set the stage for further gains. Dogecoin Holding Strong Above $0.10 Dogecoin (DOGE) has been between $0.092 and $0.115 since early August, forming a consolidation pattern many analysts believe signals accumulation by smart money. This consolidation suggests that significant players may be preparing for a potential breakout. Some analysts are particularly optimistic, stating that DOGE is breaking out of a monthly downtrend channel that began in late March when Dogecoin was trading at $0.22. One top analyst and investor, Daan, shared a technical analysis on X showing DOGE breaking through this downtrend line, which presents a new opportunity for meme coin investors. Daan emphasizes that if DOGE holds above the critical $0.105 support and can break above the $0.12 level with conviction, the meme coin could aggressively surge to higher prices. According to Daan, once Dogecoin confirms an uptrend, its price skyrockets rapidly, leaving no room for hesitation. Historically, when DOGE enters such phases, it experiences sharp upward movements accompanied by high volatility. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Faces Serious Risk After Failing To Close Above Key Level – Details This potential move has drawn attention to Dogecoin, as investors and traders alike are eager to see if it will continue to dominate the meme coin sector. The next few days and weeks will be critical in determining whether DOGE can sustain its momentum and break through these key resistance levels. DOGE Price Analysis Dogecoin (DOGE) is trading at $0.101 after experiencing a 7% dip since Friday. Before this decline, DOGE surged over 22% from local lows on September 6, marking a strong recovery in a short period. Last Friday, the price broke above the 4-hour 200 exponential moving average (EMA) at around $0.103, often seen as a signal of short-term strength. However, despite this move, DOGE has struggled to maintain its position above the 4H 200 EMA, and recent price action has hovered just below this key level. For DOGE to regain bullish momentum, it is essential for the price to reclaim the 4H 200 EMA and hold above it. This would provide short-term support and potentially pave the way for targeting higher prices. On the other hand, if DOGE fails to close above this EMA, a deeper correction is likely, with the next major support level expected around $0.097.

42407604,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga0BdN,1726513730,Trump's Crypto Gambit: What We Know About the Launch of World Liberty Financial,"With little over a month and a half to go till the U.S. presidential election, Donald Trump's schedule is packed – rallies, debates, stump speeches, crisscrossing the country to campaign in battleground states. Over the weekend, at his golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida, he became the target of what the FBI described as an attempted assassination.  Despite all that, the former president and Republican nominee has carved out some time later on Monday to unveil a new crypto company: World Liberty Financial.  At 8 p.m. on X (formerly Twitter), Trump is scheduled to livestream specifics of the blockchain app that he and his sons have been teasing for months in the leadup to November's presidential election.  The project has already sparked controversy. Hackers recently compromised X accounts belonging to members of the Trump family, promoting fake links to the crypto company. While the real app has yet to be officially launched, leaked details of the project's leadership team – and its ties to another recently hacked crypto app – have sparked concern among some of the former president's supporters in the crypto world.  Earlier this month, CoinDesk obtained a confidential draft for the project outlining plans for an app meant to make decentralized finance (DeFi) accessible to the masses. Decentralized finance refers to blockchain-based tools that allow users to directly trade, borrow, lend and invest assets without traditional middlemen.  After deriding bitcoin as ""based on thin air"" in 2019, Trump has explicitly embraced the technology and amped up his pro-crypto rhetoric in recent months, especially with the blockchain industry emerging as one of the election cycle's biggest corporate fundraisers. His speech at the Bitcoin Nashville conference in July outlining favorable crypto policies was met with repeated standing ovations and cheers from the thousands of attendees.  The white paper obtained by CoinDesk advertises World Liberty Financial as a way of ""putting the power of finance back in the hands of the people,"" as an answer to the ""rigged"" financial system.  Who is involved  World Liberty Financial's team includes a mix of Trump family members (18-year-old Barron is listed as chief ""DeFi Visionary""), traditional financial figures and blockchain industry leaders. The elder Trump's title with the project would be ""chief crypto advocate,"" according to the white paper.  The pair spearheading the project – Zak Folkman and Chase Herro – are not well-known in the crypto world.  CoinDesk previously reported that the duo was responsible for Dough Finance, a DeFi product that failed to gain traction and was hacked for $2 million over the summer.  The pitch outlined in World Liberty Financial's white paper closely resembles that of Dough. Both platforms are modeled as user-friendly interfaces for accessing Aave, a popular Ethereum-based lending market, and some of the early code for the Trump-backed crypto app appears to have been lifted directly from Herro and Folkman's older project.  Outside of crypto, Folkman and Herro are the founders of Subify, a censorship-free subscription platform similar to OnlyFans that is best known for its association with the influencer Logan Paul.  Folkman, who registered the LLC for World Liberty Financial, used to deliver seminars advising men on how to pick up women. According to a Bloomberg report published last week, Herro has promoted himself as the ""dirtbag of the internet"" and has promoted failed cryptocurrencies, colon cleanses and get-rich-quick classes.  Read more: World Liberty Financial: Inside the Trump Crypto Project Linked to $2M DeFi Hack and Former Pick-Up Artist  A Trump crypto token  Crypto projects frequently release governance tokens to ""decentralize"" their products and sidestep arduous securities regulations. World Liberty has not officially unveiled its plans for a cryptocurrency, but the white paper reviewed by CoinDesk suggested that the project will eventually sell a governance token called WLFI.  According to the document, the Ethereum-based WLFI token will be non-transferable, meaning it won't be possible to trade on the blockchain, but holders will be able to use it to vote on changes to World Liberty's development roadmap.  An unusually large 70% of WLFI tokens have apparently been reserved for World Liberty's team and developers. The rest will be sold to the public, with the proceeds from that sale also reserved for World Liberty insiders.  While crypto projects generally reserve a portion of tokens to compensate founders, investors and developers, these groups rarely receive more than 20% or 30% of the total supply. WLFI's allocation to insiders is much larger than peer projects, and token presales are relatively uncommon altogether in today's crypto industry because they tend to face legal and practical hurdles.  The transfer restrictions may be designed to make WLFI look less like a stock in the eyes of regulators since they will make the asset difficult to buy and sell like other speculative cryptocurrencies. However, traders frequently sell IOUs for blockchain assets via legal agreements and handshake deals, and WLFI holders could ostensibly vote to make the asset directly transferable on blockchains in the future.  Read more: In Trump-Backed Crypto Project, Insiders Are Poised for Unusually Big Token Payouts  Community response  Trump has fashioned himself as cryptocurrency's sole champion in this year'spresidential race, and his crypto venture uses anti-establishment rhetoric that could resonate with single-issue crypto voters and MAGA populists alike. (Neither Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, nor his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, mentioned crypto at last week's televised debate.)  While it is unclear how closely World Liberty Financial will ultimately resemble its white paper, some of Trump's backers within the crypto industry are worried that the whole plan could backfire.  ""Is there something that we, as crypto twitter, can collectively do to stop the launch of world liberty coin,"" Nic Carter, a prominent crypto industry figure and Trump supporter, asked on X (formerly Twitter) after CoinDesk published its initial report on World Liberty Financial's white paper.  Though the Trump family appears deeply involved in World Liberty Financial and Donald Trump will be officially unveiling it on Monday evening, the project's white paper claims that the platform has no political affiliation, stating: ""World Liberty Financial is not owned, managed, operated, or sold by Donald J. Trump, the Trump Organization, or any of their respective family members, affiliates, or principals.""  It adds: ""However, they may own $WLFI and receive compensation from World Liberty Financial and its developers. World Liberty Financial and $WLFI are not political and have no affiliation with any political campaign.""",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/09/16/trumps-crypto-gambit-what-we-know-about-todays-launch-of-world-liberty-financial,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/facd364c41742d1a8df3c193d7c94b945ecc0985-1920x1081.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

He spent three months in Lompoc II before being moved to a halfway house in San Pedro, California in late August.  Zhao was sentenced to four months in prison in April, five months after he pleaded guilty to violating the Bank Secrecy Act by failing to set up an adequate know-your-customer (KYC) program at Binance. As part of his guilty plea, Zhao also agreed to pay a $50 million fine and step down as CEO of the crypto exchange.  After Zhao stepped down, Richard Teng – a former regulator in both Abu Dhabi and Singapore – was appointed CEO of Binance. In addition to the charges against Zhao, Binance was also criminally charged with violating U.S. sanctions and money transmitting laws and agreed to pay $4.3 million to settle the allegations.

33658030,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=642296,1726509652,Avalanche Revenue Nosedives Over 40% In Q2 –  Impact On AVAX Price,"Avalanche (AVAX) has had a terrible Q2 2024 by several standards, going by a significant decline in market capitalization coupled with low revenue generation. Related Reading: Toncoin (TON) Climbs 20% – Here’s What’s Pushing The Price Up Messari’s recent report indicated that AVAX faced a fierce correction after two quarters of growth on the trot. Market capitalization dipped by 40% within the last quarter to stand at $11.6 billion. Well, despite this slump, the ecosystem is still sound as AVAX still has a market cap of $4.5 billion — that’s a 157% surge compared to the same period in 2023. State of @avax Q2 Key Update: Several partnerships announced, notable ones include @stripe, @homium, and @konami. QoQ Metrics 📊 – Staked AVAX ⬆️ 6% – DeFi TVL (AVAX) ⬆️ 11% – Stables ⬆️ 13% Read the full report 🔗https://t.co/7xsKIj1ml3 pic.twitter.com/0dSZnfXOVE — Messari (@MessariCrypto) September 13, 2024 Price Forecast Shines Through The Dip The slump is paining the larger ecosystem, but the future of AVAX seems brighter. In fact, the price forecast of the token will shine hope for investors. AVAX is seen going up 70.68% over the next three months, showing a bounce from the recent prices, analysis from CoinCheckup shows. This bullish sentiment is bolstered by long-term projections that suggest a 166% growth over the next year. It seems AVAX is poised for recovery, making it an intriguing asset for traders keeping an eye on the market. Revenue Plunge And On-Chain Activity Revenue for the Avalanche ecosystem was another source of worry, as its value went down from 176,700 AVAX in Q2 2024 to 96,200 AVAX during the same period. In dollar terms, that translated into $7.5 million going down to $3.5 million. Pullback is due to slowed activity across different on-chain platforms. However, some analysts believe that a renewed interest in on-chain-based transactions could help revive revenue growth in the short term. Despite these drops, staking remains robust within the Avalanche ecosystem. There is a 6% increase in the number of staked AVAX tokens due to new measures to boost staking. Staking rewards continue to attract new investors despite a fall in active validator count by 7%. This reflects some unease among validators amidst these market conditions. Network Stability Average transaction counts remain mixed. With approximately 11,262 transactions and an average block time of 1.61 seconds, Avalanche is showing stability. More than 2% of the total coins have been sent from the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm wallet. Despite the recorded drops, new initiatives are expected to boost staking and future coin balances. Related Reading: The Sandbox (SAND) Sets Sights On 1,111% Growth Amid Crypto Market Pressures Interestingly, where the network had an average transaction that depreciated by 57% from 495,000 to 201,500, some protocols on Avalanche refused to abide by this trend. Tether (USDT) and GMX increased transaction volumes, which indicated specific sectors in the system are doing well despite this broad slowdown for the crypto market. Since AVAX is preparing for a potential rebound from the market, its investors may be able to see renewed interest in the asset in case such forecasted growth in price comes true. The partial recovery in the transaction volumes for selected protocols also suggests something more is being involved under the surface–a sign that Avalanche might pick up fast once the crypto market picks up. For now, investors are keen enough to observe how AVAX acts in the short and medium terms.

Trump said the announcement would be on Trump's X Spaces channel at 8 p.m. ET. NBC News reported earlier in the day that events surrounding the launch at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida would continue despite the reported assassination attempt on him at his nearby golf course. CoinDesk reported earlier this month , citing a white paper draft it obtained, that 70% of World Liberty Financial’s WFLI “governance” crypto tokens will be owned “by the founders, team, and service providers.” The other 30%, the report said, will be sold “via a public sale,” and some of the proceeds will also go to project insiders, but some will be reserved in a treasury “to support World Liberty’s financial operations.” The white paper, CoinDesk reported, said Trump’s crypto currency “will be non-transferrable and locked indefinitely in a wallet or smart contract until such time, if ever, $WFLI are unlocked through protocol governance procedures in a manner that does not contravene applicable law.” According to CoinDesk, Trump is listed in the white paper as World Liberty Financial’s “chief crypto advocate,” and sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump share the post of “web 3 ambassador. Barron Trump is its “DeFi visionary,” the white paper reportedly said. DeFi is short for decentralized finance. The launch is in line with Trump’s remarks on the campaign trail where he has pledged to make the US the world’s “crypto capital” if he wins the White House again. It also has raised some ethical concerns by corruption watchdogs. “Taking a pro-crypto stance is not necessarily troubling; the troubling aspect is doing it while starting a way to personally benefit from it,” Jordan Libowitz, a spokesperson for government watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, was quoted as saying by the Associated Press earlier this month. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), on Monday was +3.75% over the last 24 hours to $57,521.69 in trading volume of $32.32B, according to CoinDesk data.

33656624,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=642406,1726506252,Crypto Trends To Watch: Analyst Details 10 Reasons That Could Lead To Massive Q4 Gains,"As the crypto market grapples with significant volatility and uncertainty, expert analyst Miles Deutscher has outlined ten reasons to be optimistic about the year’s fourth quarter (Q4). With Q4 fast approaching, Deutscher emphasizes that a monumental market shift could catch many investors off guard. Trends And Factors That Could Impact The Crypto Market In a recent social media post, Deutscher broke down his analysis into seasonality, macroeconomic factors, and crypto-specific elements. Deutscher begins by discussing the concept of seasonality, noting that market movements often follow cyclical patterns. Related Reading: Ethereum In Danger: Analyst Explains What Could Trigger Crash To $1,800 Historically, Q4 has proven to be the strongest quarter for equities, with the S&P 500 gaining an average of 3.8% since 1945 and rising 77% of the time. Bitcoin (BTC) has also shown notable performance during this period, averaging a return of 88.84%. Deutscher points to the previous two Halving years, where Bitcoin saw gains of 58.17% in 2016 and 168.02% in 2020. He notes that Q3 typically represents a challenging period for BTC, making the upcoming months particularly significant. The period from October to April is often regarded as crypto’s “boom season,” further underscoring the potential for gains. Moving beyond seasonal trends, Deutscher highlights several macroeconomic factors that could impact the crypto market. With the US federal election just two months away, he suggests a Trump presidency could be more favorable for the market. However, a Kamala Harris win would not be catastrophic. Current odds from Polymarket indicate a near 50/50 split on the election outcome. Deutscher also points to cooling inflation rates and the anticipation of Federal Reserve rate cuts as pivotal elements. The recent Consumer Price Index (CPI) reading is the lowest since February 2021, and a Fed pivot could be imminent. He explains that while rate cuts are often viewed negatively, historical data shows they can be bullish during non-recessionary periods. Additionally, a potential weakening of the US dollar, resulting from rate cuts, would likely benefit risk assets, including Bitcoin. Deutscher emphasizes that Bitcoin is highly correlated with global liquidity and is forecasted to continue rising into 2025, creating a favorable environment for cryptocurrency. Bullish On Long-Term Growth Prospects In the realm of crypto-specific dynamics, Deutscher notes that many retail investors have been flushed out of the market. Metrics such as Google Trends and social engagement indicate a significant drop in retail participation, suggesting that those remaining may be better positioned for potential gains. The analyst also observes a decline in the Coinbase app’s rankings, which previously surged during market highs. This trend points to a broader sense of apathy among retail investors, but Deutscher believes that such off-side positioning could pave the way for aggressive market expansion. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Nosedives Over 5%, Pressure Mounts on Bulls Furthermore, Deutscher highlights the upcoming repayment of $16 billion to FTX creditors. Unlike the previous cash drain associated with the Mt. Gox refunds to affected users, these paybacks could inject liquidity into the market, with many users likely to reinvest their capital. Ultimately, it is clear that Deutscher presents a bullish case for Q4, and why it could be a turning point for the crypto market. While he acknowledges that volatility is natural in the digital asset ecosystem, he remains optimistic about significant gains in the medium to long term. When writing, the largest cryptocurrency on the market is trading at $57,880, recording losses of nearly 4% in the 24 hours.

Reports indicate that approximately $1.3 billion worth of Bitcoin has been withdrawn from various crypto exchanges, signaling a renewed interest and confidence in the leading cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Accumulation Frenzy Resumes Data from IntoTheBlock has revealed a new accumulation trend amongst Bitcoin investors. According to the financial service platform, roughly $1.29 billion worth of BTC has exited various Centralized Exchanges (CEXs) in the last week. Related Reading: Analyst Sounds Warning For Bullish Investors, Says Solana Will Crash 42% To $80 This development signals a shift in investors’ sentiment from a previously bearish stance. Just this September, Bitcoin has experienced severe price fluctuations and volatility, raising concerns amongst investors about the cryptocurrency’s future outlook. There have even been reports of liquidation in the market, with analysts noting that September is historically a bearish period for the crypto market. With Bitcoin now seeing renewed momentum and experiencing a price surge above the $60,000 mark, investors’ interest in the cryptocurrency has resurged. Based on IntoTheBlock’s report, the majority of Bitcoin outflows, amounting to 12,420 BTC, from crypto exchanges occurred on Tuesday, September 10. During this time, the price of the cryptocurrency had been trading below $60,000, suggesting that investors were accumulating in anticipation of a potential price surge. Apparently, Bitcoin holders had begun selling their holdings and taking profits around Friday, September 13. ITB’s data also revealed that 82% of BTC investors are currently making gains, while 13% are in loss. Interestingly, this accumulation trend has extended its influence towards Bitcoin whales. In an X (formerly Twitter) post on September 14, popular crypto trader, Ash Crypto, unveiled a lofty Bitcoin transaction involving the purchase of 1,062 BTC, valued at $64 million by an anonymous whale. With the new Bitcoin addition, the unidentified whale now holds a whopping 10,043 BTC, worth approximately $600 million, based on exchange rates at the time. This move by the whale is also an indication that the market is transitioning into a more bullish and positive sentiment. This trend is common after a market correction or a decline in a cryptocurrency, where prices have reached a perceived low. Will BTC’s Price Hit $75,000? The recent spike in Bitcoin accumulation indicates that investors are now looking favorably at the cryptocurrency, possibly anticipating a price increase in the future. This new trend could potentially trigger a rally to new all-time highs around $75,000 if it continues. Related Reading: ‘Super Guppy’ Indicator Shows XRP Is Ready For A Surge To $99 Earlier this year, when Bitcoin accumulation was at one of its highest, the price of the cryptocurrency had surged to its current all-time high of above $73,000. This bullish development could reoccur as demand and interest in the cryptocurrency surges. Although Bitcoin saw a rise above $60,000 over the past week, its price is now down by 2.37% and currently trading at $58,739, according to CoinMarketCap.

42407601,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga0BWl,1726502457,Is EigenLayer Ready For Institutional Adoption?,"There is currently $11 billion worth of value locked up within the EigenLayer project. By TVL (total value locked) it’s below only the liquid staking platform Lido (which is so popular that Ethereum devs warn about its centralization risk) at $23bn TVL, and Aave, the well-established crypto lending and borrowing marketplace, which has $11.3bn TVL. The EigenLayer project has raised $600m in funding from investors such as Coinbase Ventures and a16z.  EigenLayer and restaking have therefore been hot topics on conference stages and are a key ecosystem narrative for 2024. However, while EigenLayer is an understandable fit for more risk-accepting retail investors, it doesn’t currently fully meet institutional needs. EigenLayer is therefore going to have to decide whether it’s building for the mass retail market or whether it needs to pay attention to the needs of institutional players coming into the space.  So why is EigenLayer, as currently built, unsuitable for institutions?  Firstly, the majority of institutions hold their assets with a qualified custodian or trusted institutionally-focused wallet provider. However the primary delegation flow for restaking with EigenLayer is via their user interface and requires a connection to DeFi wallets such as Metamask, Trust or Rainbow. Institutions therefore require their custodian or wallet provider to build the necessary integrations into the Eigenlayer ecosystem in such a way that their institution’s staking provider of choice, such as Twinstake, can also be integrated in the flow. However to date, most institutionally focussed custodians have limited EigenLayer integrations, therefore blocking access into the ecosystem.  The next crucial consideration for an institution is who they are restaking to – the Operator in EigenLayer parlance.  Institutional players will likely choose Operators that offer legally-enforceable performance guarantees, as seen with their preference to use staking providers over permissionless staking protocols. They will expect protections such as slashing risk insurance (the process of penalizing a validator for misbehavior); at present, no external providers currently offer this at the institutional level.  Another notable consideration and choice for institutions is deciding who should select the AVS (Actively Validated Services). These are services such as zero-knowledge provers, data availability layers and oracles. The Operator runs software and hardware in order to generate rewards for their delegators. However, should the Operator or their delegator choose the AVS support list?  The current model fits a retail client base whereby no individual delegator meets the minimum active delegation amount (currently 32ETH) and so the decision “power” lies with the Operator. They select the AVS based on their requirements and any delegators restaking with them simply subscribe to this.  However, institutions will be restaking well above a single Operator’s minimum amount, and could therefore have their own dedicated Operator. In this case, there needs to be a consensus on who is responsible for AVS selection and who will take on the reputation or legal risk of poor AVS selection.  A further institutional consideration is around rewards. Although the rewards distribution mechanism was recently launched, the majority of AVSs on EigenLayer still operate through the point-based system. Whilst this may avoid the challenging legal and regulatory position of token launches, it requires institutions to navigate an untested environment of points accrual and interpret tax laws that don’t currently account for conversions from points to blockchain-based token systems.  In line with this, the current model for AVSs allows for the rewards to be paid out in the AVS’s own token (as well as ETH and EIGEN). It’s likely that the majority of AVSs will have their own token however if this can’t be received into custody by the preferred institutional custodians then this could severely limit institutional options for AVS selection. Furthermore, institutions may have concerns about the stability and longevity of potential rewards when comparing the high restaked amount and what the total useful security budget for the current 16 AVSs may be.  Over the last few months there has been a steady decline in TVL, however still at almost $11 billion, one could question whether such an amount is required now or in the medium term for the projects using EigenLayer for their security budget. In line with this, many are new projects which are still looking to secure product market fit and sufficient level of use. The risk is that many of these AVSs aren’t able to find this and therefore don’t have sufficiently liquid and stable token prices. This could result in institutions holding rewards of illiquid assets, and the commission paid to Operators therefore outweighing the potential rewards that institutions can generate.  The overarching blocker to the institutional adoption of EigenLayer right now is the most simple of all – smart contract risk. This is the hardest to solve as no amount of audits can give certainty against a hack or code mishap, and one of the strongest proof points of safety is simply time.  Therefore while institutions are showing strong interest in the restaking narrative, realistically many are still getting comfortable with DEXs and anything beyond vanilla on-chain activity. It is therefore my view that institutions will continue to sit on the sidelines until the above aspects are resolved and until retail investors have tested the waters, which in my view still feels a little cold.

33654977,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=642322,1726502454,"Nervos Network (CKB) Price Prediction 2024, 2025 & 2026, CKB Whales Add Mpeppe To Crypto Bags","Nervos Network (CKB) has caught the attention of the broader crypto community, with its price soaring by 55% in the last 24 hours. This bullish sentiment, driven by strong market fundamentals and increased interest from institutional investors, suggests that Nervos Network (CKB) could be poised for even more significant gains in the coming years. In this article, we will dive into Nervos Network (CKB)’s price prediction for 2024, 2025, and 2026, and explore why CKB whales are adding Mpeppe (MPEPE) to their portfolios. 2024 Price Prediction: A Bullish Year Ahead As of September 2024, Nervos Network (CKB) is trading at $0.0139, marking a significant 55.04% increase compared to 24 hours ago. The recent listing on Upbit has propelled the token into the limelight, and with the current bullish trend, Nervos Network (CKB) could easily see its price rise further. Analysts predict that by the end of 2024, Nervos Network (CKB) could reach the $0.01907 mark, a 41% increase from its current price. Nervos Network (CKB) has shown tremendous growth on both the weekly and monthly charts, with gains of over 77.49% and 73.76%, respectively. Given its upward momentum and favorable technical indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Simple Moving Averages (SMA), Nervos Network (CKB) is on track to continue its bullish trend through the end of 2024. 2025 Price Prediction: Continued Adoption and Growth Looking ahead to 2025, Nervos Network (CKB) is expected to experience continued adoption as blockchain interoperability becomes a critical focus for developers. The coin’s price could see steady growth, potentially reaching $0.030 by mid-2025. Several factors will contribute to this growth, including the expansion of DeFi applications built on the Nervos blockchain and its integration with major platforms. Additionally, Nervos Network (CKB)’s partnership with Layer 2 solutions could boost its ecosystem, making it more appealing to developers and investors alike. By 2025, the Nervos Network (CKB) could solidify its position as one of the top Layer 1 blockchain projects, with potential price growth of over 100% from current levels. 2026 Price Prediction: Long-Term Potential for Massive Gains By 2026, Nervos Network (CKB) could see exponential growth as the broader cryptocurrency market matures and more investors recognize the potential of interoperable blockchains. Some analysts predict that Nervos Network (CKB) could reach $0.050 by the end of 2026, as institutional investors begin to take a greater interest in blockchain technology. One notable development in 2026 could be the continued accumulation of Nervos Network (CKB) by large holders, or “whales.” Many of these whales have already started adding Mpeppe (MPEPE) to their crypto bags, seeing the potential for massive gains in the meme coin space. Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers an intriguing opportunity for CKB whales to diversify their portfolios, particularly as the token is set to launch its decentralized casino platform, combining meme culture with real-world utility. Conclusion: A Promising Future for CKB and Mpeppe Nervos Network (CKB) is well-positioned for strong growth in 2024, 2025, and 2026, driven by its focus on blockchain interoperability and the expansion of its ecosystem. With whales adding Mpeppe (MPEPE) to their portfolios, the two projects could offer significant gains for investors. Whether you’re interested in the long-term potential of Nervos Network (CKB) or the explosive upside of Mpeppe (MPEPE), these cryptocurrencies present exciting opportunities in the rapidly evolving crypto market.

42407607,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga0Bgg,1726500600,Second Assassination Attempt Barely Moves Trump's Polymarket Odds,"This week in prediction markets:  Second assassination attempt not boosting Trump’s odds as election betting nears $1 billion on Polymarket  Oral arguments set for Thursday in CFTC appeal of the case it lost to Kalshi.  Are you ready for 20X leveraged election betting?  What will Trump say tonight?  Donald Trump survived an apparent second assassination attempt over the weekend.  The U.S. Secret Service found a man hiding in the bushes with an assault rifle at Trump's golf course in Florida while the former president was playing. While the gunman, identified as Ryan Wesley Routh of Hawaii, didn’t fire a shot, the very notion of a second assassination attempt during the presidential campaign created headlines like this one from The Economist: “Another attempt on Donald Trump’s life will shake up the election” (though it was later changed to “Another attempt to kill Trump raises fears of political violence"").  Maybe editors at the magazine took a look at crypto-based prediction market platform, Polymarket, where election trading is about to hit $1 billion, because bettors are brushing off this incident as a non-issue.  Trump’s odds actually went down in the hours after the incident, and as of midmorning Monday in New York, he was trailing Democratic nominee Kamala Harris by 49-50.  To be fair to the Economist, the first assassination attempt, when a shot was fired and grazed Trump's ear, boosted his odds significantly – though that was when he was still running against the senescent incumbent, Joe Biden.  The probabilities are based on how much traders are willing to pay for shares that pay out money if the predictions come true and become worthless if they don't. Bets on Polymarket are programmed into a smart contract on the Polygon blockchain and paid out in USDC, a dollar-linked token. Under a regulatory settlement, the platform blocks U.S. users, although crafty American traders have used VPNs to get around the geofencing.  Eye on swing states  As with any U.S. presidential election, a lot is riding on the swing states.  Polymarket bettors are fairly convinced that neither candidate will win all of them: one contract asking if Harris will win all six only gives a 24% chance of that happening, while another asking if Trump will do the same is at 17%.  For the individual state contracts, currently Republicans lead in Arizona with a 61% chance, Georgia at 59%, North Carolina at 57%, and Pennsylvania at 51%. In Nevada, the race is tied 50-50, while Democrats lead in Michigan and Wisconsin.  Meanwhile, Polymarket continues to cast the race as closer than what professional pollsters are calling. Nate Silver’s Silver Bulletin model from Sept. 11 gives Trump a strong chance to win the all-important electoral college at 61%, which, if won, dictates the rest of the election. (Silver is an advisor to Polymarket.)  While all this is happening, U.S.-regulated prediction market Kalshi has frozen its long-sought election markets pending a court decision in an appeal brought by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. A Kalshi contract on which party will win the House in November had volume of $20,000, while another about which party will win the Senate had volume of $45,000.  The freeze looks set to last at least three more days. Oral arguments in the appeal are scheduled for Thursday, according to a Monday court filing.  Another CFTC-regulated exchange, Interactive Brokers' ForecastEx, has said it will soon list election markets. Unlike Polymarket, ForecastEx and Kalshi settle bets in fiat.  20X leverage incoming  LogX, a perpetual futures crypto trading protocol, said it raised $4 million to expand into leveraged prediction markets.  The noncustodial ""DEX-like"" market, which is building what it called a DeFi superapp to onboard the next generation of retail users, said on its website that it will offer up to 20X leverage on contracts on outcomes such as whether Trump or Harris will win the election.  This platform’s approach to prediction markets is similar to D8X, which launched leveraged prediction market trading in July, insofar that it relies on an oracle from Polymarket to scrape pricing data and put it into LogX for traders. However, D8X maxes out at 2X leverage.  Akshit Bordia, LogX’s Founder, explained in an interview that once the pricing data is on the platform, his protocol's market makers will take opposite positions on Polymarket to generate liquidity.  Right now, Bordia says the maximum bet for Trump or Harris election contracts is $100,000.  “What we're seeing now is the next iteration of prediction markets,"" Bordia said in an interview with CoinDesk. “Many of these have grown significantly, gaining mass media attention. That's why it's become so exciting and much bigger than it was in the previous cycle.""  What’s the plan for after the election? Sports and crypto price betting.  Hashed Emergent, Cumberland, DWF Ventures, and Orderly Network CEO Ryan Lee participated in the round.  Sorry, Milady  Trump has been called the first crypto president by his fans, but he hasn’t mentioned bitcoin or other digital assets in his recent public appearances, such as an X space with Elon Musk or the recent presidential debate.  This is likely to change when he takes to Rug Radio late Monday to launch World Liberty Financial, making him the first president to both endorse a specific crypto project and launch a business on the campaign trail.  Bettors on Polymarket are putting their money on Trump saying ""crypto"" at least five times, giving it a 66% chance of happening and a 34% chance of him saying ""bitcoin"" that many times.  Unfortunately for those holding Milady NFTs – a collection of characters with bizarrely shaped heads and large, expressive anime-style eyes – there’s only a 3% chance the Republican presidential candidate will name-drop them during the broadcast.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | ZRX,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/news-analysis/2024/09/16/second-assassination-attempt-barely-moves-trumps-polymarket-odds,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c43003f46d56e0e03e75e827059fd9cfd93d7b40-1920x1331.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The bank noted that U.S.-listed miners' share of the network hashrate increased for the fifth straight month to a new record.  The fall in the hashprice, coupled with seasonal trends, could limit hashrate growth in the near term, JPMorgan said.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} mining stocks fell in the first half of September as the price of the world's largest cryptocurrency remained below $60,000, and the network's hashrate rose, JPMorgan (JPM) said in a research report on Monday.  The hashrate has risen 4% month-to-date and is now back to pre-halving levels, the report noted. Hashrate refers to the total combined computational power used to mine and process transactions on a proof-of-work blockchain and is a proxy for competition in the mining industry.  The hashprice, a measure of miner's daily profitability, has fallen 2% this month, and is more than 50% below pre-halving levels, the bank noted, and this decline, when ""coupled with seasonal curtailment, could slow near-term hashrate growth.""

33653203,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=642190,1726498814,"Ethereum In Danger: Analyst Explains What Could Trigger Crash To $1,800","An analyst has explained how losing this on-chain demand zone could cause Ethereum to witness a crash to as low as $1,800. Ethereum Is Currently Retesting A Major On-Chain Support Zone In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has discussed about how Ethereum is looking like in terms of investor cost basis distribution right now, citing data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock. In the above chart, the dots represent the amount of ETH that was last purchased by investors or addresses inside the corresponding price range. As is visible, the $2,292 to $2,359 range stands out in terms of the size of its dot, suggesting that some heavy buying had occurred between these levels. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sentiment Spikes After Mild Price Jump: Crowd Too Excited Too Quickly? More specifically, almost 52.3 million ETH was acquired by 1.9 million addresses inside this range. Since Ethereum is currently retesting the range, all these investors would be just breaking-even on their investment. To any investor, their cost basis is naturally an important level and thus, they may be more prone to making some kind of move when a retest of it happens. For ranges that host the acquisition level of only a small amount of holders, though, any reaction resulting from a retest isn’t anything too relevant for the wider market. In the case of price ranges that are huge demand zones, however, a retest can cause visible fluctuations in the asset’s price. The aforementioned Ethereum range naturally belongs to this category. As for how exactly a retest of a large demand zone would affect the cryptocurrency, the answer lies in investor psychology. Retests that take place from above, that is, of investors who were in profit just before the retest, generally produce a buying reaction in the market. This is because these holders may believe the asset will go up again in the future, so getting to buy more at their cost basis can appear like a profitable opportunity. As Ethereum is currently retesting the $2,292 to $2,359 range, it’s possible it may feel support and find a rebound. In the scenario that a break under it takes place, however, the cryptocurrency’s price may be in danger. From the chart, it’s apparent that the ranges below this demand zone only carry the cost basis of a small amount of investors, so they may not be able to prevent a further decline in the asset. Related Reading: Legendary Bitcoin Puell Multiple Finally Enters ‘Buy’ Territory “If this demand zone breaks, we could see a sell-off driving ETH toward $1,800,” notes the analyst. A drawdown to this level from the current price would mean a crash of more than 21% for the coin. It now remains to be seen how the Ethereum price will develop in the coming days and if the on-chain support zone will hold. ETH Price After retracing its recovery from the last few days, Ethereum is back at $2,300, which is inside the aforementioned price range.

The startup building Pipe Network, Permissionless Labs, is focusing on one of the unseen but ubiquitous pieces of the modern internet. Many websites cannot afford to let their content lag as it zips long distances from hosting server to end-user. So they rely on networks of relay servers that can be called upon by the end-users to which they're geographically close.  A handful of powerful internet companies like Cloudflare and Akamai run the CDNs that proliferate the modern internet and keep it moving fast. Their systems work just fine. But Permissionless Labs thinks crypto incentives can prompt regular people to lend their own computing power into a competitive alternative.  Enter the decentralized virtual infrastructure network (or DeVIN), crypto's head-scratching evolution to the previous craze, decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN). Think: Helium used tokens to prompt people to set up wifi routers in random places. The same basic tokenomics principles apply to Pipe's DeVIN setup.  In its conception people can rapidly scale up CDN nodes in the places they're needed most by lending their existing computing power, CEO David Rhodus told CoinDesk. Their computers will then help end-users access cached content that might have otherwise been difficult to quickly deliver because of the distance between them and the servers that content lives on.

In August, the International Monetary Fund announced that it had different discussions with Salvadoran authorities and “progress has been made in the negotiations toward a Fund-supported program.”  The president of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, said he will submit a 2025 deficit-free budget to the Legislative Assembly.  “I announce that this September 30 we will present before the Legislative Assembly for the first time in decades the first fully financed budget, without the need to take a single cent of debt for current spending,"" said Bukele on Sunday, during the commemoration of the 203 years of El Salvador’s independence. ""El Salvador will no longer spend more than it produces annually,"" he continued. ""We will not even lend money to pay the interest on the debts that we inherited, we will even pay that from our own production.""  ""A more robust economy and a truly independent country will be seen, not only because it has more freedom and security but because it will be financially independent, fiscally independent,"" he added. ""The new generations will inherit an economically prosperous country.”  El Salvador’s Finance Minister, Jerson Posada, detailed that it will be “the first time in decades that the country will have a budget that will not issue a single cent of debt, neither local nor foreign”, Diario El Salvador reported.  Bukele has an overwhelming majority in the Legislative Assembly, with 57 of the 60 total seats among legislators from his party, Nuevas Ideas (54), and allies (3).  The 2024 budget gap was $338 million on total spending of $9.1B, according to an official document published by the Assembly. The budget deficit when Bukele took office, in 2019, was $1.2 billion.  El Salvador is unable to print money to fund expenditures because in 2001 it imposed the U.S. dollar as legal tender. The country famously added bitcoin as legal tender in 2021.  Although there are no official documents on El Salvador's bitcoin purchases, the website NayibTracker — which put together a portfolio based on Bukele’s announcements — shows that the Central American country currently holds 5,874 bitcoins at a total value of $331.4 million, which represents an unrealized gain of 32.6% or $43 million.  Bukele last month acknowledged that “Bitcoin hasn't had the widespread adoption we hoped for ... it could have worked better, and there is still time to make some improvements, but it hasn’t resulted in anything negative.”  In August, the International Monetary Fund announced that it had different discussions with Salvadoran authorities and “progress has been made in the negotiations toward a Fund-supported program, focused on policies to strengthen public finances, boost bank reserve buffers, improve governance and transparency, and mitigate the risks from Bitcoin”.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT | REGULATION,Andrés Engler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/09/16/el-salvador-president-nayib-bukele-to-present-debt-free-budget-for-2025,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/67a31bb4ba157d05c0f665d6f8edc6f2e5282adc-1920x1081.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

MARA, at current valuations, can benefit disproportionally compared to other Bitcoin miners in the coming potential bull run. This article explains why it is justifiable for unprofitable Bitcoin miners trading at PBR>1 and why MARA's shareholder dilution may not matter. This opportunity also acts as a risk for MARA as MARA lacks alternative proposition from cost efficiencies and profitability aspects. While we can't give a buy rating now, MARA ranks high in our watchlist as we await Bitcoin's 2 confirmations for a potential bull run. Introduction In our previous article, we suggested that investors in Marathon Holdings ( MARA ) should bet on its three characteristics: growing reserves, financially sustainable operations, and the ability to raise capital at good valuations to acquire underperforming competitors. Over the past 2 quarters, we think that MARA has performed well in 2 out of the 3 fronts. We saw MARA grow its reserves by 64%, from 15,741 Bitcoins in January to 25,945 in August. It also raised capital at reasonable valuations to make acquisitions (although its acquisitions of Bitcoin and not Bitcoin miners, like Riot Platform's ( RIOT ) acquisition of Bitfarms ( BITF )). The only front MARA did not perform is on its operating cost efficiencies, resulting from its declining network share, an issue we pointed out in our previous article. Considering its performance, we think there's a market error we can exploit through MARA, potentially giving us asymmetric returns relative to other miners if it regains PBR superiority. Hence, in this article, we'll update our thesis accordingly and also discuss why shareholder dilution may not matter in this case. A Market Error Opportunity in the Ongoing Mean Reversion Currently, we are observing an ongoing mean reversion on Bitcoin miner valuations. By referring to Fig 1, we can see that MARA, which is usually trading above the sector average PBR, has now reverted back to the mean. We saw CleanSpark ( CLSK ), which diverted away from the mean to see significance outperformance, revert back to the mean. We also saw Iris Energy ( IREN ), which usually trades below the sector average PBR due to the lack of Bitcoin reserves, revert back to the mean. Fig 1. Price-to-book value ratio of major Bitcoin mining companies (Author) When the market reverts to the mean, the valuation dynamic changes. This creates an opportunity to scoop up certain stocks that were previously overvalued and are now potentially undervalued, hence the market error. In a podcast 3 years ago, Howard Marks mentioned that the best asset allocation strategy to be ""cautiously long"" is to allocate within the asset class. He explained that within every asset class, there'll be assets that perform better in good times and worse in bad times, and vice versa. This is the strategy we unknowingly followed when we tilted our portfolio between Bitcoin and Bitcoin miners in the past . This is also the strategy we're currently undertaking in preparation for a potential upcoming bull run. Hence, our ongoing series of analyses of Bitcoin miners aims to identify the best Bitcoin miners to tilt into. This thesis represents how we might find MARA fitting in our portfolio. Is A Price-to-book value ratio ('PBR') >1 Justifiable for Unprofitable Bitcoin Miners? Let's turn our attention back to Fig 1. Aside from the mean reversion that is taking place, we can also see that the sector average PBR fluctuates over time. This fluctuation can be explained by Bitcoin optimism and pessimism. When the Bitcoin price trended up/down (Fig 2), we can see that the market average PBR also trended accordingly. Fig 2. Bitcoin Historical Price (Author) The first problem we have to address is whether unprofitable Bitcoin mining companies trading above PBR=1 is justifiable. If no, we shouldn't be looking at it further. Based on our experience, PBR>1 is usually a side effect of a high Price-to-earnings ratio: The market anticipates higher earnings, appreciates the share price, and causes PBR to increase alongside PER as book value remains the same. Now, consider an entity that does not generate any income, its value would simply be worth its assets (assuming no depreciation), hence PBR = 1. An unprofitable business without a profitability prospect would trade PBR So, is Unprofitable Bitcoin companies trading at PBR>1 justifiable? Yes, unprofitable Bitcoin miners can justify a PBR>1 because their quarterly reported profits are not realized profits unless the Bitcoins mined are sold. Profitability is realized in cash. In traditional businesses that operate with cash transactions, if a deal is unprofitable, it remains unprofitable - there's no changing that. In contrast, a Bitcoin mining company can HOLD until Bitcoin appreciates above its costs basis to realize profits. So, Bitcoin optimism will lead investors to expect the sale of Bitcoin at higher prices to cover the previous costs. Hence, unprofitable Bitcoin miners can indeed justify a PBR>1 on Bitcoin optimism. This problem has to be addressed, all major Bitcoin miners are now unprofitable (and are often unprofitable). Data by YCharts The Thesis With the justification of PBR>1 out of the way, we can now look at our investment thesis for MARA. Given our expectation of a potential bull run, we should also expect the sector average PBR to increase. This would essentially benefit all Bitcoin miners. Recall that there are assets that will perform better during good times. We think that there are fundamental reasons why MARA can be the best performing Bitcoin miner. PBR favors companies with appreciable (or at least depreciation-resistant) assets but does not account for shareholder dilution. It is after considering shareholder dilution, only then we can measure how much value we, as (potential) shareholders, can extract. So we have to look at both aspects. In terms of Book Value, a Bitcoin bull run favors a Bitcoin mining with a higher proportion of Bitcoin on its balance sheet. It's not about the amount of Bitcoins but the proportion. It's like allocating 1% of a portfolio to Bitcoin, even if Bitcoins double, it would only contribute a 1% portfolio return. So, it's the proportion that matters. Regarding Bitcoin proportion on the balance sheet, MARA ranks No. 1 by a margin (Fig 3). Hence, MARA's book value is fundamentally able to extract more value from a Bitcoin bull run than other miners. Fig 3. Proportion (%) of Bitcoin over Total Asset (Author) Based on the prospect of book value appreciation combined with a higher average sector PBR driven by Bitcoin optimism, we expect MARA to benefit disproportionately compared to other Bitcoin miners. In terms of shareholder dilution, MARA is also the best performer. Not only did MARA's shareholder equity (per share) not decrease, but it increased (Fig 4). This means that MARA's shareholders did not lose any equity despite almost tripling outstanding shares since 2022Q1. Table 1. MARA's Historical Shares Outstanding QR Shares Outstanding 2024Q2 287 2024Q1 269 2023Q4 242.9 2023Q3 210.2 2023Q2 174.2 2023Q1 167.26 2022Q4 145.567 2022Q3 116.8 2022Q2 113.865 2022Q1 103.12 Fig 4. Normalized Book Value Per Share (Author) Combining MARA's strong book value prospects with minimal shareholder dilution, it is reasonable to conclude that the market has mispriced MARA at the sector's average PBR. Among the strategies available to trade this mean reversion, we find that MARA offers the best return-risk profile. Another available mean reversion play is RIOT, though we perceived it to be significantly riskier. (The article on RIOT is undergoing editorial process and will be available soon) The Risk There's risk to every thesis, including this one. The risk to this thesis is the same as its opportunity, in addition to the lack of an alternative proposition. Remember that some assets within the same asset class might do poorly during bad times? MARA could be one of them in the sector. During a Bitcoin drawdown, MARA's book value will suffer the most because of the larger proportion of Bitcoin. In addition, MARA lacks alternative proposition such as high operating cost efficiency, growing network share, or other profitability proposition. MARA's cost basis is higher than the sector average (Fig 5) while losing network share (declining Bitcoin production (Fig 6)). This could also imply that MARA might not be able to maintain its performance in the shareholder dilution aspect. Just look at what happened to MARA's PBR in 2022Q4 in Fig 1. Fig 5. All-in cost basis per Bitcoin for major Bitcoin mining companies (Author) Fig 6. Normalized Network Share of major Bitcoin miners (Author) Therefore, since MARA's thesis is centered around its book value, we must be cautious about exposing ourselves only to situations that benefit high-book-value companies. That's why it is crucial for us to wait for the 2 confirmations before holding a Bitcoin bullish bias. If a Bitcoin bull run does not take place, then MARA could perform worse than the sector. Verdict We often receive comments here on Seeking Alpha about ""Bitcoin is a scam"" or ""Bitcoin is going to 0"". While that may still be true, we always have to ask ""when?"" and ""why?"". The same applies to stocks. You can read on our doomsday scenario where Bitcoin could go to $0 here . For now, we think that MARA's valuation at 2 PBR is an opportunity we can exploit.

42407623,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga0HV5,1726495200,BitGo Unveils Token Management Service for Crypto Foundations,"Protocol builders face a fragmented landscape when it comes to sorting out the mechanics of token management, BitGo says.  Protocols like Worldcoin, LayerZero, SUI and ZetaChain are among the first customers of the service.  Cryptocurrency custody firm BitGo is offering foundations and organizations a simplified way to manage the lifecycle of digital assets they issue, with protocols like Worldcoin, LayerZero, Sui and ZetaChain among the first customers of the service.  Bitgo says it’s filling a gap in a fragmented market, with a one-stop, regulated and insured custody platform for seamless digital asset vesting, unlocking and on-chain activities. The custodial token management service uses the regulated confines of BitGo Trust, the firm’s qualified custodian offering.  The Web3 world has evolved far beyond straightforward digital asset transactions on a blockchain into a programmable economy where, with just a few lines of code, new protocols can be concocted, tokenomics invented and tokens minted.  This leads to a situation where protocol builders are primarily focused on refining technical details around tokenomics, validator steps and so on, while looking to grow adoption and justify the value proposition they gave to their venture-capital backers, said Thomas Chen, head of sales at BitGo. Leaving the nuts and bolts of token management until last can end up like a “slow moving train wreck,” Chen said.  “When it comes to managing their tokens, these firms encounter a fragmented landscape,” Chen said in an interview. “It’s a mix of non-custodial wallets, web-only solutions, with the need to use a smart contract for distribution. So if I'm the head of operations for some new token protocol, I've got to strike up at least two different relationships, manage two to three different integration points, all the while trying to have a successful mainnet launch.

Recent technical indications and charts suggest that BTC could be on the cusp of a significant price move. The cryptocurrency is geared for a bounce that could take the asset far beyond $92,000, despite recent losses. Related Reading: The Sandbox (SAND) Sets Sights On 1,111% Growth Amid Crypto Market Pressures Short-Term Projection Bitcoin’s immediate technical projection points to a possibly positive trend. Right now, Bitcoin is selling 39.27% below its projected price for next month, according to CoinCheckup. Still, an increase is seen in the coming week; short-term signs suggest a possible comeback. With forecasts of a 70.68% gain, this momentum might open the path for significant price rise over the next three months. These short-term signs could point to a buying opportunity before a bigger rise starts. Past Performance And Forecasts This price movement of Bitcoin coincides with trends that have been exhibited during past halving events. According to popular analyst Titan of Crypto, the current trend goes in line with most the previous trends, especially the post-halving periods that have been the source of various significant movements. #Bitcoin Rally Imminent? 🚀 In previous cycles, when the price retested the 50-week simple moving average 🔴, it bounced at least 40%. On average, the bounce was 71%. If #BTC rallies 71% from here, it could reach $92,000. pic.twitter.com/e3ghGxn3NS — Titan of Crypto (@Washigorira) September 13, 2024 Titan underlined on the weekly chart a significant support level retest on September 13th, which historically has resulted in average price gains of 71%. According to his analysis based on historical data, Bitcoin might soon surpass the $92,000 mark, therefore attaining a new record for the currency. For Bitcoin, it’s always been a challenging month because average returns come in at around -4.69%. But history would tell a different tale when the following months, especially October and November, go on to reflect considerable increases. In October, Bitcoin has normally delivered average gains of 22.9%; in November, 46.8%.This trend supports the present projection of a possible comeback, therefore strengthening the belief that Bitcoin might bounce back rather powerfully in the next months. Bitcoin Long-Term Outlook In the long-run, the prospect of Bitcoin remains very promising. It will almost certainly rise upward with an estimation of 102% for the next six months and a chance to rise within the year by 166%. This would show intense market confidence in the future of the virtual currency and might even let Bitcoin continue outperforming at its current low. Related Reading: FET: 30% Breakthrough Draws Investor Attention As New Developments Roll Out The ability of the cryptocurrency to recover the $60,000 level lately shows a good change in market attitude, which prepares the ground for the possible price gains. All things considered, historical patterns and present technical indications of Bitcoin point to a bright future. Although current losses and short-term difficulties create hazards, generally the pattern shows a big comeback and possible price surge. Bitcoin is a good asset for both present and future benefits since investors who negotiate the short-term volatility could be well-positioned to profit from the expected long-term development. The chances for a strong comeback for Bitcoin seem more feasible as the market steadies and momentum gathers.

42407640,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga0I8l,1726492281,"First Neiro on Ethereum, Related to Dogecoin, Rockets 700% on Binance Spot Listing","The announcement of Binance listing First Neiro on Ethereum (NEIRO) for spot trading triggered a massive 700% price surge, catapulting its market cap from $15 million to $146 million in a day, with trading volumes skyrocketing from $8 million to over $220 million.  Binance's decision to list two different NEIRO tokens, one for futures and another for spot trading, each with distinct contract addresses, has led to community backlash and confusion over which token represents the ""true"" NEIRO.  NEIRO, inspired by Neiro, a Shiba Inu related to the Dogecoin mascot Kabosu, has spawned multiple tokens across blockchains. Despite the community's enthusiasm, Kabosumama, Neiro's owner, has explicitly distanced herself from endorsing any NEIRO tokens.  A Binance spot listing of a token related to dogecoin {{DOGE}} has fueled a 700% rally in its prices, one of the biggest jumps on a listing in recent months.  Binance said early Monday it would offer First Neiro on Ethereum (NEIRO), and two other tokens, as part of its spot offering to users later in the day. The influential exchange already offers Neiro tokens as a futures product - and a subsequent spot listing is an industry practice.  The twist, however, is that the two NEIRO tokens have different contract addresses and are maintained by different teams.  “This Futures listing is for 'First Neiro On Ethereum' (NEIRO) with the contract address here for verification: 0x812ba41e071c7b7fa4ebcfb62df5f45f6fa853ee,” Binance said in an announcement.  “This is a different token from the NEIROETH Futures listing dated 2024-09-06 (a different token contract address for verification here: 0xee2a03aa6dacf51c18679c516ad5283d8e7c2637),” it said.  Community reactions to Binance’s X post were widely critical of the decision.  “You’re listing two different Neiro on spot and futures?” wrote @0x_degengod. “How are you gonna list the 15M Neiro when you already have the 130M on futures,” exclaimed @cozypront.  NEIRO tokens jumped over 700% instantly after the Binance announcement, before paring gains, zooming from a market capitalization of $146 million from Sunday’s $15 million. Trading volumes jumped from $8 million in a 24-hour-period over Saturday to Sunday, to over $220 million in the past 24 hours.  Binance data shows that the existing futures of the NEIROETH token has bagged nearly $1 billion in trading volumes in the past 24 hours. Its prices are down 40% since early Asian trading hours Monday, with most losses coming after Binance decided to list the First Neiro on Ethereum token (listed under only “NEIRO”) on its platform.  What is Neiro?  Neiro is a Shiba Inu pup owned by the same person whose pet dog Kabosu inspired the popular dogecoin memecoin. Kabosu passed away in May at the age of 17, leaving a legacy that includes a statue and a memecoin worth $18 billion.  In late May Kabosumama, the X account of Kabosu's human owner, adopted a ten-year-old Shiba Inu dog named Neiro and called her a “new family member.”  That birthed hundreds of NEIRO memecoins on Ethereum, Solana and other blockchains at the time. Eventually, two NEIROs - one on Ethereum and one on Solana - attracted enough trading volumes and market interest to form an active holders community. Both communities still consider their NEIRO is be the actual, original one.  Kabosumama, on her part, has distanced herself from all NEIRO tokens and said in May that she does not endorse any such tokens.",NEUTRAL,DOGE | ETH,DOGE | ETH | EXCHANGE | TRADING | BNB,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/09/16/first-neiro-on-ethereum-related-to-dogecoin-rockets-700-on-binance-spot-listing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ac62b6355bc79fe10527046707255f903b2969b8-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42407641,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga0IC4,1726491600,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren's Pro-Crypto Opponent, John Deaton, Has a Plan to Beat Her","The crypto industry's least favorite U.S. lawmaker, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, has a Republican opponent in the November election, John Deaton, who carries heavy digital asset credentials.  Lawyer Deaton says if he can get enough name recognition in the state, the people there are unhappy enough with Warren's performance to give him a shot.  Defeating U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), a national hero in progressive circles, seems a stretch for a relatively little-known Republican in the liberal bastion of Massachusetts. But candidate John Deaton, known among crypto fans for his legal advocacy, says it can be done by leveraging the concerns of people in that state.  Deaton, who Warren has already attacked as a tool of crypto billionaires, said the second-term senator isn't as popular at home as elsewhere and that Massachusetts' cost of living and immigration problems are worrying voters. From his end, he said the race will come down to whether his campaign can raise enough money to compete, whether he can get his message out and how hard he works between now and the November vote.  Warren won in her last race six years ago by a colossal 24 percentage points. Her approval rating, according to University of Massachusetts Amherst/WCVB polling earlier this year, has coasted at a steady 54%, with a 4.4% margin of error. That poll in May showed respondents favored Warren in a head-to-head matchup with Deaton at 47% to 24%, though that was before he won the Republican primary with almost two thirds of the vote.  ""This race is winnable,"" Deaton said in an interview with CoinDesk. ""I believe that we're going to be pleasantly surprised at how competitive this race is going to be.""  Despite the headlines he's drawn for his pro-bono efforts to weigh in with the courts on such crypto disputes as Ripple's existential fight with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or Coinbase Inc.'s similar battle, Deaton is more known as a lawyer representing people harmed by asbestos. He served as a Marine and wrote a book in 2023, ""Food Stamp Warrior."" Because of his interest in crypto over the years, he said, about 80% of his net worth is in bitcoin.  While Warren has focused on Deaton's connections to the digital assets industry, he responds by asking why she's so focused on crypto when there are much more pressing issues.  ""I've been calling Sen. Warren the crypto candidate,"" he said. ""Why did the senior senator from Massachusetts wake up one day and say, 'You know what, I'm going to announce my reelection for a third term, and I'm going to focus on building an anti crypto army'?""  He says he's not a supporter of former President Donald Trump, putting him in a minority among Republican candidates nationwide. And when asked about advocacy of crypto on the presidential campaign trail, Deaton said that people should be cautious of pandering during elections.  ""President Trump certainly has said things that the industry loves to hear, that America is going to be the crypto capital of the world,"" Deaton said. ""I'm not saying that he doesn't mean it. I'm just saying that we all need to focus on, I believe, voting for who the best candidate is in each race.""  Deaton calls himself a common-sense centrist. He flags inflation, opioid addiction and immigration's drain on his state's resources as issues worthy of attention.  ""Doesn't matter to me who the president is,"" he said. ""If it's good for Massachesetts and America, I'm all in.""  So far, high-profile Warren is absolutely dominant in the money race. She's amassed $19 million in this race, according to the latest Federal Election Commission data. Deaton hadn't yet cleared $2 million, and $1 million of that was from his own pocket. His only advantage to date is the outside money making independent advertising buys – about $1.3 million worth at last count, paid for by prominent crypto interests.  That was from a political action committee, the Commonwealth Unity Fund, whose very existence suggests there may be a crypto industry disagreement on what to do about Deaton's campaign. The Deaton-devoted super PAC is backed by crypto names including Ripple Labs, the Winklevoss brothers (Tyler and Cameron) and Phil Potter, a former Bitfinex and Tether executive. All of them had a role in standing up and funding the industry's major campaign-finance effort, the Fairshake PAC and its affiliates. But Fairshake hasn't weighed in for Deaton.  Fairshake spent $10 million just to defeat a Senate candidate in California the organizers thought would behave like Warren in the Senate, and the affiliated PACs have spent millions more against congressional candidates endorsed by her. But so far, Fairshake has remained on the sidelines in the actual race to oppose Warren directly. Spokesman Josh Vlasto declined to comment on that.  ""I need to raise as much money as I can to get the name recognition up,"" Deaton said. ""The crypto world might know John Deaton in Massachusetts … but the regular population doesn't.""  If Deaton does get elected to the Senate, he has a fantasy involving crypto industry adversary Gary Gensler, the SEC chair: ""Before Gary Gensler resigns or leaves, that I get to cross-examine him,"" he said. ""I can assure you that'll be fun.""",NEUTRAL,없음,EXCHANGE | REGULATION | USDT,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/09/16/sen-elizabeth-warrens-pro-crypto-opponent-john-deaton-has-a-plan-to-beat-her,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fbb763ac5b921cff3a5061e19a275772538377c0-4000x2250.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42407645,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga0IPI,1726489614,Ether-Bitcoin Ratio Drops to Lowest Since April 2021. Here’s Why It Matters,"The ETH/BTC ratio has hit its lowest since April 2021, dipping below 0.04, signaling a decline in investor interest in ether relative to bitcoin.  The preference has swung towards bitcoin, which was influenced by the introduction of bitcoin ETFs, which saw significant inflows compared to ether ETFs experiencing net outflows.  Some traders say this shift indicates a broader market favoring bitcoin's perceived stability over ether's riskier, high-yield potential.  Analysts suggest the ETH/BTC ratio might drop further, potentially to the 0.02-0.03 range, unless there's a significant change in investor sentiment or regulatory clarity that might favor riskier assets like altcoins.  A closely watched ratio tracking the relative price strength of ether {{ETH}} against bitcoin {{BTC}} has dropped to its lowest level since April 2021, indicative of a fallout in investor demand for the world’s second-largest token.  The ether-bitcoin trading pair fell under 0.04 late Sunday to trade at 0.039 in European morning hours Monday, extending year-to-date losses to nearly 30%. Although colloquially called a ratio - ETH/BTC is simply the trading pair of ether against bitcoin on crypto exchanges, which attracts hundreds of millions in daily volumes.  Over the past five years, the ETH/BTC ratio has risen from 0.02 to a peak of above 0.08 in early 2022 - meaning ETH had quadrupled in value relative to BTC at the time.  Its value proposition has been on the decline ever since - bitcoin set fresh lifetime highs in April in U.S. dollars (before tumbling 20%), while ether is yet to break its highs from 2021 and is down 52% from its 2021 peak. Year-to-date, bitcoin has returned over 40% to investors while ether holders have gained just under 1%.  A surge indicates that ether is outperforming bitcoin and vice-versa. During a rise, traders consider a preference for ETH as beneficial for riskier assets and Ethereum ecosystem bets. On the other hand, a slide indicates a preference for Bitcoin and blockchains other than Ethereum.  Some traders say that demand for ether relative to bitcoin peaked in 2023, following which spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) moved the goalposts in BTC’s favor.  “The long-term reason for the rise has been the activity of Ethereum developers, both in relation to the blockchain itself and the growing ecosystem around it,” FxPro senior analyst Alex Kuptsikevich said in an email to CoinDesk. “However, by the end of 2023, the trend shifted in Bitcoin's favor as the prospect of exchange-traded ETFs gained prominence.”  “It is important to note that the launch of ETFs on Ethereum has neither attracted similar buying interest, resulting in net outflows, nor reversed this downward trend in ratio,” Kuptsikevich added.  Ether ETFs have recorded net outflows of $580 million since going live in late July. In comparison, bitcoin ETFs took on over $12 billion in their first two months, and have recorded over $17 billion in net inflows in just over eight months of trading.  Technical aspects and the promise of better yield on other blockchains also contributed to the lack of demand for ETH, some opine.  “ETH/BTC is reaching new lows as the yield from staking ETH continues to be uncompetitive at around or less than 3% APR while staking stablecoins or trading other ecosystem tokens like TON deliver high yields,” crypto market researcher Nick Ruck said in a message to CoinDesk.  “BTC has also held up well within its range as the bitcoin spot ETFs recorded their best day of inflows in the last two weeks on Sept 13th, adding to its allure against ETH,” Ruck added.  Meanwhile, traders such as Kuptsikevich see further pain ahead for those betting on the ETH/BTC ratio.  “This ratio has the potential to fall further into the 0.02-0.03 range. This is surprising given the generally positive investor sentiment towards altcoins a few months after the BTC halving and the generally higher beta of altcoins to the stock market, which has been quite strong in recent months,” he noted.  “Investors are likely waiting for more clarity on the future monetary and regulatory regime. Only a sustained rally will encourage investors to seek higher returns and take more risks by buying altcoins,” Kuptsikevich concluded.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/news-analysis/2024/09/16/ether-bitcoin-ratio-drops-to-lowest-since-april-2021-heres-why-it-matters,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ae6cfc4e2d472bdfd04f0084aaa515a00f58b142-3840x2160.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

33649319,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=24159,1726489231,Ethereum hậu Merge: Thành công hay Thách thức?,"Merge đã ảnh hưởng tích cực đến Ethereum hay chưa? Đã hai năm trôi qua kể từ khi Ethereum thực hiện The Merge, chuyển đổi từ cơ chế đồng thuận Proof of Work (PoW) sang Proof of Stake (PoS). Mặc dù The Merge mang lại những lợi ích về mặt môi trường, Ethereum vẫn phải đối mặt với những thách thức về khả năng mở rộng và phí giao dịch cao. Điều này đã dẫn đến sự di chuyển của người dùng và nhà phát triển sang các giải pháp Layer 2 và các blockchain khác, làm giảm hoạt động và doanh thu trên Ethereum. Những thách thức Ethereum phải đối mặt là gì? Khả năng mở rộng và phí giao dịch: Mặc dù The Merge đã giải quyết vấn đề tiêu thụ năng lượng, Ethereum vẫn phải đối mặt với tình trạng tắc nghẽn và phí giao dịch cao. Điều này đã khiến người dùng và nhà phát triển tìm kiếm các giải pháp thay thế như Layer 2 (Optimism, Arbitrum, ZK-rollups) và các blockchain mới hơn như Solana, Sui và Aptos. Sự cạnh tranh từ các giải pháp Layer 2 và blockchain khác: Các giải pháp Layer 2 cung cấp giao dịch nhanh hơn và rẻ hơn, trong khi các blockchain khác thu hút người dùng bằng thông lượng cao và phí thấp. Điều này đã làm giảm đáng kể hoạt động trên Ethereum. Hiệu suất của Ethereum ETF: Sự ra mắt của Ethereum ETF đã không tạo ra sự tăng trưởng đáng kể như kỳ vọng, góp phần làm giảm giá trị của ETH so với Bitcoin. Tâm lý thị trường: Tâm lý thị trường đối với Ethereum đã bị ảnh hưởng tiêu cực bởi những thách thức trên, cũng như bởi sự cạnh tranh ngày càng tăng từ các hệ sinh thái khác trong lĩnh vực DeFi và NFT. Tương lai của Ethereum Mặc dù phải đối mặt với nhiều thách thức, Ethereum vẫn có tiềm năng to lớn để phát triển và khẳng định vị thế của mình trong tương lai. Một số yếu tố then chốt sẽ đóng vai trò quan trọng trong việc định hình tương lai của Ethereum: Nâng cấp khả năng mở rộng: Các nâng cấp sắp tới, đặc biệt là thông qua sharding và phát triển Layer 2, sẽ cải thiện đáng kể thông lượng giao dịch của Ethereum. Điều này sẽ giải quyết các vấn đề về tắc nghẽn và phí giao dịch cao, thu hút người dùng và nhà phát triển trở lại mạng lưới. Cộng đồng nhà phát triển: Ethereum sở hữu một cộng đồng nhà phát triển năng động và sáng tạo, không ngừng nghiên cứu và phát triển các công nghệ mới. Sự hỗ trợ và đóng góp của cộng đồng này sẽ là động lực quan trọng để Ethereum tiếp tục đổi mới và phát triển. Tiêu chuẩn công nghiệp: EVM và Solidity đã trở thành tiêu chuẩn công nghiệp cho các DApp và hợp đồng thông minh, củng cố vị thế của Ethereum như một nền tảng cơ bản trong hệ sinh thái tiền điện tử. Sự chấp nhận rộng rãi này đảm bảo rằng Ethereum sẽ tiếp tục đóng vai trò trung tâm trong sự đổi mới của DeFi, NFT và các lĩnh vực khác dựa trên blockchain. Ethereum ETF: Mặc dù khởi đầu không mấy ấn tượng, các sản phẩm Ethereum ETF vẫn còn nhiều tiềm năng phát triển. Khi thị trường trưởng thành và niềm tin của nhà đầu tư vào Ethereum tăng lên, các ETF này có thể thu hút sự quan tâm lớn hơn, mở ra những cơ hội mới cho các nhà đầu tư truyền thống tiếp cận Ethereum. Tóm lại là: Mặc dù The Merge đã mang lại một số lợi ích, Ethereum vẫn phải đối mặt với những thách thức đáng kể. Mặc dù đối mặt với sự cạnh tranh gay gắt, Ethereum có đủ khả năng để vượt qua những thách thức hiện tại và khẳng định lại vị thế dẫn đầu của mình trong không gian tiền điện tử. Sự thành công của Ethereum sẽ phụ thuộc vào việc thực hiện các nâng cấp quan trọng, cải thiện hiệu suất và đáp ứng nhu cầu ngày càng tăng của người dùng và nhà phát triển. Nếu Ethereum có thể làm được điều này, nó sẽ tiếp tục là một trong những dự án blockchain hàng đầu và đóng góp quan trọng vào sự phát triển của toàn bộ ngành công nghiệp.

42407651,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga0IIg,1726489106,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Pulls Back Before Probable Fed Rate Cut,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  CoinDesk 20 Index: 1,822.90 -3.32%  Bitcoin (BTC): $58,779.97 -1.93%  Ether (ETH): $2,302.66 -4.24%  S&P 500: 5,626.02 +0.54%  Gold: $2,580.54 +1.47%  Nikkei 225: 36,581.76 -0.68%  Top Stories  Bitcoin sank below $59,000 having spent much of the weekend above the $60,000 mark. BTC traded around $58,550 in the European morning, a drop of 2.4% over 24 hours at the start of a week in which traders worldwide expect the Federal Reserve to make its first interest-rate cut in more than four years. The broader digital asset market as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) is 3.6% lower. Crypto markets were buoyed by favorable U.S. economic data on Friday, which sparked a short-term rally. Bitcoin ETFs saw inflows of over $263 million, their highest since July 22, while the ether equivalents added around $1.5 million.  Ether led losses among major cryptocurrencies, sliding 4.5% in 24 hours. Cardano’s ADA fell 5% and Solana’s SOL declined 4%, while BNB Chain’s BNB was the best performer slipping just 1.1%. Futures traders betting on higher prices lost over $143 million amid the sudden drop, CoinGlass data shows. Elsewhere, the widely watched BTC/ETH ratio, which tracks the relative movements of the two largest tokens, fell to four-year lows. Ethereum as a protocol has had some serious competition in the last year with Solana looking to be the destination of choice to launch memecoins and new chains like Coinbase's Base and Telegram-affiliated TON capturing more mindshare, which has probably hit demand for the Ethereum blockchain's native token.  The Fed is widely expected to announce an interest-rate cut on Sept. 18, kicking off the so-called easing cycle. Traders, however, are split on the size of the cut, setting the stage for a potential volatility explosion in financial markets after the decision. At press time, the Fed funds futures showed a 41% chance of the Fed reducing rates by 25 basis points (bps) to the 5%-5.25% range and a 59% probability of a bigger 50 bps reduction to the 4.7%-5% range. The stalling of bitcoin's upward momentum following its recovery from below $53,000 could be attributed to the uncertainty over the size of the impending rate cut.  Chart of the Day  The chart illustrates how the last Fed rate-cutting cycle spurred a bitcoin surge to then all-time high levels around $70,000.  Its more recent bull market jump came after the Fed ceased increasing rates, since when BTC has trod water, seemingly awaiting the next rate-cutting cycle.

Over the past week, BTC ETFs recorded $403.9 million in net inflows, reversing a prolonged period of outflows and signalling renewed investor confidence in the asset. This rally has been driven predominantly by aggressive buying in spot markets. In contrast, the futures and perpetual markets have seen less pronounced movements, suggesting that the current price increase is grounded in genuine capital inflows rather than speculative leverage, providing a more sustainable foundation for the rally. However,​​ BTC now faces critical resistance levels between $60,500 and $61,000, which have been pivotal since early March. While ETF inflows remain strong, there are signs of a potential stall as Spot CVD – the difference between buy and sell orders across exchanges – has flattened over the weekend. We see the potential for market volatility this week as quite high, driven by investor anticipation of the Fed rate cut decision. Whether the cut is 25 or 50 basis points, it could sway market sentiment between bullish optimism and cautious de-risking. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s correlation with equities is intensifying, suggesting that movements in traditional financial markets could increasingly impact Bitcoin’s price. Bitcoin has also decoupled from gold, which reached a record high last week, indicating a shift in investor preference towards traditional safe-haven assets amidst a risk-averse environment. In general, asset prices continue to be driven by the inflation outlook, which saw further cooling in August, with the Consumer Price Index rising just 0.2 percent for the month and 2.5 percent year-on-year, driven by notable drops in energy, used car, and gasoline prices. There is slightly stronger core inflation , which we believe will make the Fed more cautious about rate cuts, and we expect a smaller 25 basis point cut, rather than a more aggressive 50 basis point reduction. These developments come amidst a cooling labour market , with stable jobless claims, indicating that while the economy is decelerating, it has not reached a point of distress. This backdrop of moderate inflation and stable labour market conditions reinforces the need for the Fed to act preemptively with rate cuts, cautiously easing its policy stance. Improved consumer sentiment , highlighted by the University of Michigan’s Consumer Sentiment Index reaching a four-month high, reflecting optimism that has been fuelled by the easing inflation numbers and the knock-on effect of enhanced purchasing power. As the Fed considers its next move, the balance of risk is tilting towards protecting jobs, encouraging business investment, and unlocking cash flows. The main crypto news last week was the significant move by the UK to introduce a pioneering bill that officially recognizes digital assets as personal property, under British law. This development confirms the UK’s status as a frontrunner in global cryptocurrency legislation. In contrast, the highly anticipated presidential candidate debate between Trump and Kamala Harris left many in the crypto community disappointed, as it failed to address any issues related to taxation or regulation of cryptocurrency markets.

They also explained why they wouldn’t be sad about such a massive price decline for the flagship crypto. Bitcoin Dropping To $37,000 Would Be A Steal Happel and Allemann mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post on their shared account that a Bitcoin price drop to $37,000 would be a steal. They added that they won’t be “mad” about the price crash because it would give them an opportunity to buy more BTC at such low levels. The Glassnode co-founders won’t hesitate to buy the dip as they are confident about Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high (ATH) in this market cycle. Related Reading: ‘Super Guppy’ Indicator Shows XRP Is Ready For A Surge To $99 In an earlier X post, they stated that Bitcoin’s next run-up to $70,000 will likely see it break its current ATH of $73,000, reached in March earlier this year. Happel and Allemann added that BTC’s parabolic rally would be driven by a “strong altcoin undercurrent,” predicting that the altcoin season could occur soon enough. The Glassnode co-founders could get their wish of Bitcoin dropping to $37,000 before hitting a new ATH as crypto Zoran Kole recently predicted an imminent price crash for the flagship crypto. Kole mentioned in an X post that he believes that the low $40,000 range is coming next for Bitcoin. The analyst further highlighted a “very clear” Head-and-Shoulders pattern developing on Bitcoin’s chart, which showed that the flagship crypto could drop to as low as $36,000. He added that this bearish pattern “coincides with a yearly open retest with a strong case for a bounce right below the current yearly low of $38,500.” Kole revealed that breaking the weekly bearish market structure could invalidate this trade setup. That means Bitcoin needs to rise above $65,000 to confirm a bullish reversal. Crypto analyst Jelle also suggested that $65,000 is the level Bitcoin needs to break above to enjoy a parabolic rally to a new ATH. BTC Breakout To Happen In Next “Few Weeks” Crypto analyst Rekt Capital has offered a more bullish outlook for Bitcoin, stating that history suggests the BTC breakout could happen in the next few weeks. He also revealed that Bitcoin is close to reclaiming the reaccumulation range and resynchronizing with post-halving price tendencies. This could lead to the parabolic uptrend, which the analyst had previously mentioned is the next stage of the halving cycle. Related Reading: Analysts Kick Against Cardano Recovery, Says ADA Price Is Destined For 33% Crash In another X post, Rekt Capital indicated that it was important for Bitcoin to close this month above the quarterly level at $58,800. He stated that a close above this price level would fully confirm Bitcoin’s successful retest of this price range as support.

SOL Rival Mpeppe Casino Set To 1000X On Launch,"The cryptocurrency market is once again buzzing with speculation and excitement as Solana (SOL) continues to show strong upward momentum. With its rapid growth and expanding ecosystem, many are wondering if Solana can continue to make millionaires in 2024. However, while Solana is in the spotlight, a new rival has emerged that promises even greater potential gains: Mpeppe (MPEPE). This meme-based gambling ICO has attracted significant attention, and experts are predicting that it could 1000X on its launch, making it an enticing investment opportunity for those looking to diversify beyond Solana (SOL). Solana’s Rise to Prominence Solana (SOL) has firmly established itself as a major player in the cryptocurrency space. Recently, the platform saw a 22% increase in daily active users, with over 5.4 million new addresses created by September 2024. This impressive growth has sparked renewed interest in Solana (SOL), as more investors recognize its potential as a fast, scalable blockchain. According to analysts, Solana (SOL) could soon surpass key resistance levels and reach as high as $200, driven by its robust ecosystem and strong developer support. The increasing use of Solana (SOL) in decentralized finance (DeFi) and its integration into various applications has further cemented its position as a top contender in the cryptocurrency market. Despite low trading volumes, Solana (SOL)’s price has been steadily recovering, with technical indicators such as the EMA 200 and MACD pointing towards a continued upward trend. Mpeppe (MPEPE) Casino: A Rival with 1000X Potential While Solana (SOL) is undoubtedly on a strong upward trajectory, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has captured the attention of investors with its promise of massive returns. The Mpeppe (MPEPE) Casino, a meme-based gambling ICO, has gained significant traction ahead of its launch on Uniswap. Priced at $0.0021 during its presale, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has the potential to 1000X, offering investors the opportunity to capitalize on its high-reward profile. What makes Mpeppe (MPEPE) stand out is its unique blend of meme culture and decentralized finance features. The token incorporates yield farming, liquidity mining, and an integrated casino platform, making it an attractive option for those looking for innovative investment opportunities. With its potential for explosive growth, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has become a top choice for Solana (SOL) holders looking to diversify their portfolios. Solana’s Role in Mpeppe’s Success The relationship between Solana (SOL) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) is symbiotic, as both platforms benefit from each other’s success. Solana (SOL) has long been praised for its ability to support high-speed, low-cost transactions, making it an ideal blockchain for DeFi projects. As more developers and investors flock to Solana (SOL), the ecosystem continues to grow, providing fertile ground for innovative projects like Mpeppe (MPEPE) to thrive. For Solana (SOL) investors, Mpeppe (MPEPE) represents an exciting opportunity to diversify their holdings while remaining within the broader Solana (SOL) ecosystem. The upcoming launch of Mpeppe on Uniswap is expected to drive significant demand, further boosting both Mpeppe’s and Solana (SOL)’s value. Conclusion As Solana (SOL) continues to demonstrate strong growth and innovation, it remains a top contender for making millionaires in 2024. However, the emergence of Mpeppe (MPEPE), with its potential for 1000X gains, offers an exciting alternative for investors looking to diversify their portfolios. With Solana (SOL) supporting innovative projects like Mpeppe, the future looks bright for both platforms as they continue to attract new users and investors.

42407633,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga0HvX,1726484400,"SEC Places Heavier Scrutiny on Binance's Token Listing, Trading Process in Proposed Amended Complaint","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a proposed amended complaint against Binance.  The SEC mostly won against Binance's motion to dismiss its initial lawsuit, but a few questions about certain tokens remained unanswered in the order on a motion to dismiss.  The SEC also addressed two issues it lost – secondary BNB sales and Binance Simple Earn – in its proposed filing.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) wants to take another whack at its lawsuit against crypto exchange Binance, filing a proposed amended complaint Thursday night a few months after the federal judge overseeing the case allowed most of the regulator's charges to survive a motion to dismiss.  The SEC argued its proposed amended complaint addressed some of the judge's concerns in dismissing parts of its initial lawsuit – namely around ongoing BNB sales and Binance's Simple Earn product – and bolstered other charges that the judge did not fully address in her ruling, specifically around 10 digital assets the SEC used as examples of Binance operating as an unregistered securities purveyor.  ""The MTD Order dismissed these claims based on insufficient factual allegations to meet the Howey test, as opposed to a defective legal theory,"" the SEC filing said.  The SEC first sued Binance in June 2023, alleging the exchange was operating as an unregistered broker, clearinghouse and trading venue, offered unregistered securities through BNB and the BUSD stablecoin, as well as its staking service. Binance, Binance.US (otherwise known as BAM Trading) and Binance executives moved to dismiss the lawsuit. Judge Amy Berman Jackson, in a June 2024 ruling, dismissed charges tied to Binance's Simple Earn product and secondary BNB sales, but allowed most of the SEC's charges to proceed.  However, in a July 2024 hearing, attorneys went back-and-forth over whether the judge's ruling meant that 10 cryptocurrencies the SEC alleged were also sold as unregistered securities were still part of the case.  ""The PAC also bolsters allegations not expressly ruled upon concerning certain offers and sales of BNB and the Ten Crypto Assets to address Defendants’ prior dismissal arguments and Defendants’ anticipated argument that the MTD Order’s reasoning as to BNB secondary sales should apply to allegations concerning the Ten Crypto Assets,"" Thursday's SEC filing said.  Granting the motion to file an amended complaint won't unduly harm Binance and its affiliated persons and entities, given they'll still have a chance to respond and have been aware of the allegations since last June, the SEC said (it filed the proposed amended complaint at a court-ordered deadline; Binance has until Oct. 11 to oppose the motion).  BNB, tokens focus  A redline version of the proposed amended complaint walks through the differences, showing far more detail on the SEC's allegations about Binance's listing of various tokens – including BNB, its native coin – and how the regulator thinks the company promotes investments in these tokens.  One line adds that in addition to some cryptocurrencies being native to a specific blockchain, others may be built on top of blockchains. Another line clarified that proof-of-stake networks still reward validators like proof-of-work networks.  The proposed filing also adds ""initial exchange offerings"" to its section on initial coin offerings.  One substantial addition alleges that Binance is ""an integral part of the markets for crypto assets, including those that are offered and sold as securities, and Binance fills these markets with information republishing and amplifying the issuer and promoter statements and activity.""  The filing adds other paragraphs focusing on Binance's own role in allegedly promoting digital assets it lists and trades.  The filing emphasizes the SEC's allegation that BNB is a token that is offered and sold as a security, and the exchange's customers, employees and investors share this expectation.  ""Binance has offered and sold BNB as an 'exchange token,' marketing it to investors as an investment in the success of the Binance.com Platform and touting the potential returns that investors could expect from a potential increased demand and price for BNB as the platform grew,"" the filing said.  Binance's BNB burns and its support of projects that use BNB are also designed to help the token increase in value, the SEC alleged.  Binance paid U.S. employees, including BAM Trading (Binance.US) executives, in BNB, the SEC alleged.  ""In internal Binance town halls, Zhao frequently touted Binance’s ETOP [employee token option plan] as essentially equivalent to employee stock options – i.e., as a direct way for employees to share in any profits from the growth of the Binance.com Platform and the Binance enterprise,"" the filing alleged.  The filing goes into similar additional detail around Binance Simple Earn and the 10 digital assets – SOL, ADA, MATIC, FIL, ATOM, SAND, MANA, ALGO, AXS and COTI – it alleges were sold as unregistered securities on the Binance platform.  ""As part of their business practices and provision of intermediary services, Binance and BAM Trading promote the Ten Crypto Assets as attractive investments for their customers, including by amplifying and reinforcing the promotional statements and activity of the crypto asset issuers and promoters,"" the filing said.  Binance and the issuers of the tokens provide ""selective information"" to encourage Binance's customers to invest in the tokens, the SEC alleged, using screenshots of Binance's Solana page as an example.  ""When Binance and BAM Trading approve a listing of a crypto asset, they typically negotiate and enter into agreements with the crypto asset issuers that impose various requirements on the issuer to incentivize trading by customers of the Binance Platforms,"" the filing said.  Other pages on Binance's website, like its explanation of the term ""tokenomics,"" also refers to tokens' market value and ""equate the purchase and sale of crypto assets to trading in the traditional securities markets,"" the filing said.  Token issuers have similarly touted their teams' efforts, the SEC alleged.  Crypto asset securities  In its proposed amended complaint motion, the SEC said it was doing away with the phrase ""crypto asset securities,"" saying in a footnote that the agency ""is not referring to the crypto asset itself as the security.""  Rather, the SEC said it ""regrets any confusion it may have invited"" by using the phrase to refer to ""the full set of contracts, expectations and understandings centered on the sales and distributions"" of whichever digital assets were at question.  ""As the Court explained, the crypto asset is the subject of the investment contract. Defendants appear to argue that, even if the Ten Crypto Assets were offered and sold as securities during the ICOs, they do not remain securities into perpetuity. The SEC is not advancing this argument,"" the footnote said. ""The SEC’s allegations with respect to the Ten Crypto Assets at issue in secondary markets are that that their promotions and economic realities have not changed in any meaningful way under Howey, such that they continue to be offered and sold as investment contracts.""  In the proposed amended complaint itself, the SEC replaced ""crypto asset securities"" with ""crypto assets that were offered and sold as securities"" at various references.",NEGATIVE,BNB,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING | BNB,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/09/16/sec-places-heavier-scrutiny-on-binances-token-listing-trading-process-in-proposed-amended-complaint,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9f7993c0ca9c1391d0e6b1cffbbb43500712c42e-6000x3376.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Flappy Bird was pulled from both the Apple App Store and Google Play in February 2014 as its creator, Dong Nguyen, blamed himself for the game’s addictive nature and didn’t appreciate the fame the title’s worldwide success brought him along with allegations that he stole art and character designs from Nintendo. The game required users to keep a cartoon bird airborne as it flew between columns of pipes without hitting them.  Last year, Gametech Holdings filed a motion opposing Nguyen’s retention of the Flappy Bird trademark, arguing that it was abandoned because the game had been out of virtual stores for nearly a decade. A U.S. trademark court gave Gametech a default judgment after Nguyen failed to respond.  And now for the GameFi twist: Cybersecurity researcher Varun Biniwale spotted a number of deleted pages on the game's website that mention Solana, TON and a $FLAP token complete with the promise of a ‘Flap-to-Earn’ mode.  One developer attached to the game, Michael Roberts, told CoinTelegraph that “more information should be unfolding here shortly” in response to questions about the game’s possible crypto connections.

33645744,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=642214,1726482655,"Solana Losses Ground, Drops Below $137 As Bearish Momentum Builds","Solana has started another decline, falling below the $137 support level, signaling that bearish momentum is gaining traction. The once-promising uptrend has faltered, leaving traders and investors wondering if more losses are on the horizon. As selling pressure intensifies, the question now is whether Solana can find a new foothold or if the bears will continue to push its price lower. In this analysis, we’ll provide an in-depth analysis of Solana’s recent breakdown below this key support level, examining the growing bearish momentum and exploring the key levels to watch and what could come next for Solana. As of the time of writing, Solana was trading at approximately $131, reflecting a 4.67% decline with a market capitalization exceeding $16 billion and a trading volume surpassing $1.6 billion. Over the past 24 hours, SOL’s market cap has dropped by 4.65%, while trading volume has surged by 92.92%. How Low Can Solana Fall? On the 4-hour chart, Solana (SOL) has shown a clear shift in momentum toward the bearish side, as it decisively breaks below the critical $137 level along with the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). This breakdown reflects a weakening technical setup, with sellers gaining the upper hand and pushing SOL toward the $118 support zone. Particularly, the breach of the 100-day SMA, a widely-watched indicator of the overall market trend, suggests that negative momentum is not only increasing but may also signal a prolonged downside movement Also, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the 4-hour chart has dropped below the 50% threshold, now sitting at 35%. With the RSI attempting to move deeper into the oversold territory, it shows that bears are gaining control, and further downside could be on the horizon if buying interest doesn’t pick up soon. Related Reading: Blazing Solana: Analyst Foresees Nearly 700% Price Explosion On the daily chart, Solana is exhibiting substantial pessimistic movement, having slipped below the 100-day Simple Moving Average and forming multiple bearish candlesticks as it moves toward the $118 level. This steady decline underscores strong selling pressure and deteriorating market sentiment, signaling a heightened risk of further losses. The persistent downward momentum indicates that bears are firmly in control, with SOL potentially facing even deeper corrections in the near term. Finally, the 1-day RSI indicates that bearish pressure on SOL is intensifying as the indicator has recently dropped to 43% after failing to rise above the 50% mark, highlighting increased selling pressure and a growing downside signal for the cryptocurrency. Potential Support Zones To Watch For A Rebound As SOL navigates its current bearish trend, key support zones to watch include $118, which serves as a significant psychological and technical level where a strong defense could indicate a potential reversal or consolidation. If $118 fails to hold, $99 could provide additional support, acting as a historical pivot point and possible base for recovery. Related Reading: Solana On watch: SOL Price Could Crash To $90 If This Happens Should Solana rebound at any of these support levels, the price could start moving upward toward the $137 resistance mark. A successful breakout above this resistance could signal a shift to a bullish trend, potentially leading to further gains as SOL targets higher resistance levels.

From what you search to the websites you visit, this data is harvested and sold to fuel targeted ads that seem to follow you everywhere. With the vast majority of websites relying on Google’s advertising network, escaping this constant surveillance is a challenge, leaving many to question whether true privacy is even possible. That’s where Hero Browser comes in. Designed for those who value their privacy, Hero offers a fast, secure browsing experience without sacrificing anonymity online. Built by a developer team with over 15 years of experience working on Chromium browsers at Brave, Yandex, and others, Hero Browser ensures top-tier security and performance. The browser is already available for test access, allowing early users to experience its groundbreaking features firsthand. Manage Your Digital Assets with Privacy and Ease When it comes to privacy and security, Hero Browser is second to none. It blocks trackers and intrusive ads, ensuring that your browsing data remains confidential. With its built-in VPN and advanced encryption technologies, Hero safeguards your online activities, making it one of the most secure browsing options available.

Managing digital assets is also a breeze with Hero Browser. The integrated cryptocurrency wallet allows users to store, manage, and transact with digital assets directly within the browser. Supporting multiple cryptocurrencies and all major blockchain networks, the wallet offers real-time updates on portfolio performance, making it simple to manage your digital wealth. Moreover, Hero Browser gives you full control over your advertising experience. By opting into the Search and Earn program, you can view non-intrusive, relevant ads and earn $HERO tokens in return. This feature not only enhances your browsing experience but also turns ads into a potential income stream. Finally, the browser is optimized for decentralized applications (DApps), providing seamless access to various blockchain-based services like DeFi platforms and NFT marketplaces. Whether you’re a seasoned Web3 user or just getting started, Hero makes the experience smooth, secure, and intuitive. Speed and Efficiency for a Better Browsing Experience Speed and performance are also key priorities for Hero Browser. By leveraging advanced web technologies, Hero offers fast browsing speeds and efficient performance, reducing load times and ensuring a quick, effortless web navigation experience. The user-centric design makes the browser easy to navigate, whether you’re a beginner or an experienced user in the Web3 space. Behind the scenes, Hero Browser is powered by a cutting-edge technology stack. It employs advanced encryption to ensure the highest level of security, including end-to-end encryption for data transfers and secure communication protocols. Hero also integrates with multiple blockchain networks, allowing for secure transactions within the Web3 ecosystem. Hero Browser also supports smart contracts, enabling users to engage with decentralized services directly through the browser. Furthermore, by incorporating decentralized storage solutions, Hero ensures that your data is securely stored across the network, reducing the risk of data breaches. The Bottom Line The need for a browser that genuinely prioritizes user privacy has never been more critical. Hero Browser addresses this growing concern by offering a secure, decentralized solution designed for those who value control over their online presence. With its upcoming release, Hero Browser is set to redefine how users interact with the web, providing advanced encryption, decentralized identity management, and seamless integration with blockchain services—all while ensuring a fast and intuitive browsing experience.

33642702,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=642196,1726477241,"The Sandbox (SAND) Sets Sights On 1,111% Growth Amid Crypto Market Pressures","The Sandbox (SAND) has lately attracted interest with opposing opinions on its potential price movement. Although some analysts believe there is room for large increases, short-term data point to a more wary stance. Though long-term estimates show a different, more hopeful picture, recent studies hint to a likely price decline in the next weeks. What then is the actual SAND story, and should investors act right now or hold off? Related Reading: FET: 30% Breakthrough Draws Investor Attention As New Developments Roll Out Crypto price prediction website CoinCodex says, by mid-October 2024, the total value of The Sandbox should have gone down by 5.45% to $0.232674. Technical indicators are rather unfavorable. If indeed, as it’s turned out today, The Fear & Greed Index is neutral at 51, then there is definitely no sigh of quick recovery in sight either. SAND has 63% of the green days over the last month; however, its volatility rate is 6.27%, which speaks for continuous instability. Transient Issues Short term, SAND does not look amazing. The technical perspective of things so far is a bit conservative, meaning that now may not be the best time to buy. While SAND has recently been able to display resilience with a decent number of green days, the overall vibe is trending down. Waiting for more favorable conditions could be a preferable plan for people trying to make rapid profits. Some investors are hanging on despite the great volatility, thinking the market would shortly flip. Nothing new about volatility in cryptocurrencies; The Sandbox has seen such storms previously. This does not mean, though, SAND is impervious to more declines. Should the price projection be accurate, a slide to $0.232674 could attract more short-term market activity. Long-Term Positive Outcomes Unlike the gloomy short-term projection, some analysts—like Alan Santana—are showing a more optimistic long-term stance. Santana speculates that SAND might be in a critical accumulation phase with great upside possibility. He claims that although recent volatility has caused fluctuations, the coin has regularly reached lower lows since July 2021, pointing an overall increasing trend. Moreover, he thinks that this would be a great opportunity for long-term investors to build SAND at the present low price. #Altcoins ✴️ The Sandbox 1,111% Growth Potential (Accumulation Strategy) While we are going to be looking at the log. chart for The Sandbox, when we look at the linear chart we can simply say that this pair is trading at bottom prices.https://t.co/sx1l4xkU6a A simple… pic.twitter.com/GWEu2qSxkC — Alan Santana (@lamatrades1111) September 14, 2024 Santana has lofty long-term SAND projection. From its present price, he projects a price goal of $22.22, which offers a whopping 8,600% return on investment. Apart from this long-term objective, one has to take short-term figure into account. Santana projects a 415% rise not too far off, then a mid-term target of 1,111%. Investors could make significant gains even before the long-term goal is met. Related Reading: Toncoin (TON) Climbs 20% – Here’s What’s Pushing The Price Up Market Change To Bullish? The whole cryptocurrency sector fought to start a bull run in 2023. SAND, like several cryptocurrencies, fell to their lowest levels in recent months. Some observers believe the market is gradually turning bullish. If this changes, The Sandbox may benefit from a market resurgence. The Sandbox is currently showing $0.2532 and declining some 0.27% over the past day. Long-term promise is here–even so with a few short-term hazards–because there are some unfavorable warnings at the moment that investors will have to weigh against the more hopeful view for 2025 and going forward.

The exploit involved a hacker gaining control over an admin proxy, redirecting it to a malicious contract, leading to significant financial loss.  Over $6 million worth of various tokens from wallets belonging to on-chain brokerage DeltaPrime were drained early Monday after an apparent private key leak, security researchers said on X.  The project is offered on both Arbitrum and Avalanche blockchains. Monday’s exploit impacted only the version on Arbitrum as of European morning hours - and users could not withdraw funds (on Arbitrum) due to how the utilization of borrowing and lending works on the platform.  A hacker gained control of 0xx40e4ff9e018462ce71fa34abdfa27b8c5e2b1afb, which is the admin of proxies. Then, the hacker upgraded the proxies to point to malicious contract 0xD4CA224a176A59ed1a346FA86C3e921e01659E73, Fuzzland founder Chaofan Shou said on X.  Proxy is a contract that interacts with users and other contracts. It contains minimal logic and serves as an intermediary, but it is a key part of any application, as a compromise can mean the entire protocol is impacted.  Security firm Cyvers confirmed the exploits in a Telegram message to CoinDesk, stating tit detected “multiple suspicious transactions” involving Delta Prime and that it “seemed that admin has lost the private key.  “Affected pools so far are the #DPUSDC, #DPARB, #DPBTCb,” Cyvers said, referring to on-chain lockers holding USDC stablecoins, Arbitrum’s ARB and bitcoin {{BTC}}.  Messages sent by Delta Prime team members on its Discord channel viewed by CoinDesk said the team was investigating and working on the issue.

This prediction goes against the grain of current speculation where a rise to as high as $1,000 has been forecasted for the price. But it seems not everyone shares this sentiment as one crypto analyst has predicted that the auction’s price could suffer a massive 42% crash from here. Solana Price Turns Bearish In an analysis on the TradingView website, crypto analyst Alan Santana has warned that the Solana price is turning bearish. The analyst points to developing trends in the year 2024 compared to the year 2023 and how the current trends are more bearish. This takes in the volume of the altcoin and what has happened as a result of major spikes. Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin Will Reach $68,000 By End Of September, $90,000 In December For example, the analyst points out that in the chart, 2023 looks better than 2024. For one, the 2023 chart shows a lot of large spikes in the volume which are green. This meant that the volumes were rising, and as a result, there was also a notable spike in the Solana price. In line with this, there has also been notable spikes in the Solana volume in 2024, but that is as far as the similarities to. This time around, the spikes in the volume are red and the Solana price has crashed following this. This suggests that the current trend is more bearish and the price could fall further from here. The target from here is a crash to as low as $80. Now, if this does play out, then the Solana price would be seeing an over 40% crash. If the crash continues further, retracing the gains from the year 2023, a move down to $60 could be expected. At such prices, it would mean an over 50% decline. This Is Not The Time To Be Bullish The crypto analyst warned investors that being bullish on the Solana price right now could be a mistake. Santana further points out that the price of Solana barely moved even with the Bitcoin recovery. This lackluster performance could suggest that the bullish wave is over. Related Reading: ‘Super Guppy’ Indicator Shows XRP Is Ready For A Surge To $99 “Bitcoin moved up today and spook some people; the effect on Solana and the other Altcoins is minimum, you can see basically no growth,” the crypto analyst pointed out. “This is the proof that I mentioned on how to spot the end of the correction.” Featured image created with Dall.E, chart from Tradingview.com",NEGATIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/warning-solana-crash-42-to-80/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

42407631,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga0Hov,1726470922,Bitcoin Slips to $58K as Fed Faces Split Rate Cut Expectations,"The Fed faces split rate cut expectations as markets price in 50% probability for both 25 bps and 50 bps move this Wednesday.  Bitcoin has pulled back from above $60,000 amid rate cut uncertainty.  The coming week is shaping up to be that rare one when markets are left guessing about the Federal Reserve's impending interest rate move. The peak uncertainty seems to have put brakes on bitcoin's {{BTC}} price bounce.  The Fed is widely expected to announce an interest rate cut on Sept. 18, kicking off the so-called easing cycle, which has historically supported risk assets, including bitcoin.  Traders, however, are split on the size of the impending rate cut, setting the stage for a potential volatility explosion in financial markets after Wednesday's rate decision. At press time, the Fed funds futures showed a 50% chance of the Fed reducing rates by 25 basis points (bps) to the 5%-5.25% range. At the same time, markets saw a similar probability of a bigger 50 bps rate cut to the 4.7%-5% range.  Bitcoin's upward momentum from recent lows of $52,530 has stalled amid the rate cut uncertainty. The leading cryptocurrency by market value has pulled from $60,660 to $58,700, at the time of writing.  ""Rarely has the market gone into the Fed meeting with maximum uncertainty (halfway between 25bps and 50 bps),"" Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex and author of ""Making Sense of the Dollar,"" told CoinDesk in an email.  ""I suspect a 50 bps cut would not be good for risk assets on ideas that the Fed is more concerned about the economy and would seem to be acknowledging that it should have cut in July,"" Chandler added.  Several analysts have warned that a 50 bps cut could signal panic, denting demand for riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies. The probability of a 50 bps cut rose last week after Wall Street's Journal's Nick Timiraospublished an article the size of the rate cut was up for debate. A few Fed policymakers also raised the specter of a bigger move, bringing cheer to risk assets.  ""The market had been settling on a 25 bps rate cut before what some suspect is a planted story by Fed officials to put 50 bps back on the table Thursday. The market took the bait and ratcheted up the odds of not only one, but two half-point cuts and a quarter-point cut in the three remaining meetings of the year,"" Chandler said, adding that traders should also keep an eye on the Fed's summary of economic and interest rate projections.  ""The market is currently pricing in a sub-3% Fed funds target by the end of next year. Also, at 4.3% in July (4.2% in August), the unemployment rate is at the Fed’s long-term equilibrium level. Will this be changed?,"" Chandler quipped.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/09/16/bitcoin-slips-to-58k-as-fed-faces-split-rate-cut-expectations-as,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a2034815be0f5ade3e4e59c590590ce2e58cd4de-1200x675.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42407624,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga0Hbh,1726467980,Fed Rate-Cut Anticipation Weighs on Crypto Markets as Week Kicks Off,"Bitcoin started the week with a 3% decline, falling below $58,400. The drop came ahead of expectations of the U.S. Federal Reserve potentially cutting rates, influencing market sentiment.  U.S.-listed Bitcoin ETFs saw significant inflows on Friday at over $263 million in the highest since July 22.  Ether ETFs also saw inflows, though much smaller at $1.5 million, indicating continued investor interest in crypto assets.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} began the trading week down 3%, trading below $58,400, as the CoinDesk 20, a measure of the largest digital assets, was down 5%.  BTC spent much of the weekend over $60,000 after favorable U.S. data fueled a rise late Friday. BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) listed in the U.S. recorded over $263 million in net inflows - the highest since July 22 - while ether ETFs recorded their second day of inflows since August 28 at $1.5 million.  However, crypto markets slumped Monday as Asian exchanges opened for trading ahead of a key week where traders worldwide expect the Federal Reserve to make its first rate cuts in over four years.  Polymarket bettors are giving it a 51% chance of a 50 basis points cut and a 48% chance of a 25 basis point cut, while only a 2% chance of no change.  A pivot to lower borrowing costs has historically buoyed bullish sentiment among traders as cheap access to money spurts growth in riskier sectors.  Ether {{ETH}} led losses among majors with a 5.5% drop over the past 24 hours, per CoinGecko data, to mark its worst one-day slide since early August. Cardano’s ADA fell 5%, Solana’s SOL lost 4%, while BNB Chain’s BNB emerged as the best performer with a 1.1% loss.  Nervos’ CKB was one of the few movers in the green with a 10.5% jump in the last 24 hours on continued positive sentiment after Korean exchange Upbit – where traders have a strong taste for memecoins – listed the token.  Futures traders betting on higher prices lost over $143 million amid the sudden drop, CoinGlass data shows.  Elsewhere, the widely-watched BTC/ETH ratio, which tracks the relative movement of the two largest tokens, fell to four-year lows.  Ethereum as a protocol has had some serious competition in the last year, as Solana looks to be the destination of choice to launch memecoins, and new chains like Base and Telegram-affiliated (TON) capture more mindshare - which has likely impacted demand for ETH.  Sony’s Soneium may also provide some competition as it continues to be built out. Sony and Circle announced today that USDC would be offered on the chain. Absent from the announcement was precisely how much would be issued.

BTC is now correcting gains and might decline toward the $57,500 support zone. Bitcoin is correcting gains and trading well below the $60,000 level. The price is trading below $58,800 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $60,000 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could climb again if it stays above the $57,500 support zone. Bitcoin Price Starts Downside Correction Bitcoin price started a decent increase after it broke the $58,500 resistance zone. BTC was able to climb above the $59,500 resistance. The pair even cleared the $60,000 resistance zone. However, the bears seem to be active near the $60,650 resistance zone.

A close above the $60,650 resistance might spark more upsides. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $62,000 resistance. More Downsides In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $59,200 resistance zone, it could continue to move down.
