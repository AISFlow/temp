42398781,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgZZ2,1445626281,Bitcoin in the Headlines: VAT Galore,"Bitcoin in the Headlines is a weekly analysis of bitcoin media coverage and its impact.  Mainstream outlets from across the world reported the sentencing of rogue Drug Enforcement Agent Carl Mark Force to 78 months in prison this week, and in so doing brought bitcoin's association with illicit activity and the darknet back to the fore.  More positive coverage came in the form of the European Court of Justice's bitcoin VAT exemption, with some outlets exploring its effect on the digital currency's rising price.  Elsewhere, the creation of a discussion forum by a group of digital currency companies and US law enforcement agencies caused a ripple of excitement among the mainstream press.  What else has been said and by whom? Let's take a look this week's top bitcoin and blockchain headlines.  'Great news' for bitcoin  The European Court of Justice's bitcoin VAT exemption made waves both in and outside the digital currency ecosystem, while at the same time garnering the attention of a variety of journalists.  International Business Times' Ian Allison, a regular on the bitcoin beat, cited Sarah Buxton, a tax lawyer at Bryan Cave LLP, who said:  ""This ruling is great news for bitcoin enthusiasts and means that Europeans can continue to buy Bitcoins without paying tax.""  Buxton continued: ""The ruling treats bitcoin as money and should help strengthen the popularity of this cryptocurrency. This decision may be a step in the right direction towards the recognition of Bitcoin as legal tender.""  In a piece for Business Insider, Rob Pricenoted:  ""There had been fears that the court might rule that bitcoin exchanges should have to pay value-added tax (VAT), pushing up the price of bitcoin in Europe.""  The court, Price added, could have potentially ruled that bitcoin itself should be subject to tax, which ""would have entangled bitcoin businesses in significant new red tape"".  ECJ's new ruling, he concluded, is a boost for bitcoin in building credibility as a ""viable alternative currency"".  Matt Clinch said in a CNBC piece:  ""Virtual currencies can be exchanged tax free in the European Union, following a ruling from the highest court in Europe on Thursday.""  Clinch continued: ""Bitcoin is a virtual currency that allows users to exchange online credits for goods and services. While there is no central bank that issues them, bitcoins can be created online by using a computer to complete difficult tasks, a process known as mining.""  The ruling, Clinch said, paves the way for potentially cheaper transactions within the EU and therefore a boon for the nascent industry.  Blockchain Alliance  Relations between the digital currency industry and US law enforcement were brought into the spotlight following news of the establishment of a discussion forum between industry groups, startups and various agencies in the American government.  American Banker's Ian McKendry covered the announcement, framing it as an effort to bring bitcoin into the mainstream and weed out criminal activity.  He added:  ""Bitcoin and blockchain technologies have received praise for being innovative, but they have also received notoriety for being used by criminals who take advantage of the potential anonymity the technology offers to trade illegal goods and services.""  In his piece, McKendry cited Perianne Boring, president of the Digital Chamber of Commerce, who said in a statement: ""It's no secret that bitcoin has perception issues, which is a roadblock to mainstream adoption.""  Motherboard ran a piece entitled ""There's a New Alliance to Crack Down on Bitcoin Crime"", which began:  ""It's no secret that the pseudo-anonymous currency bitcoin is often used for crime. On Thursday, a group of law enforcement agencies, major bitcoin exchanges, and academics launched a group called the ""Blockchain Alliance"" in an effort to help combat blockchain-related crime and provide more legitimacy for the technology.""  Brian Fung, a reporter at the Washington Post, contextualized the creation of the group by commenting on recent events:  ""To many who aren't familiar with bitcoin, an electronic form of cash, stories like these [Carl Mark Force's sentencing] can make the online currency seem like a catnip for criminals. Sen.Joe Manchin (D-W.Va) last year urged a ban on bitcoin for precisely that reason, saying it helped people 'transacting in illegal goods and services or speculative gambling'"".  Fung added:  ""But now, as part of a wider effort to change Bitcoin's image in the minds of regulators and lawmakers, advocates of the technology have begun working with a group whose background and expertise make them well-respected within the Beltway: Federal law enforcement.""

42398771,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgXnp,1445620752,How American Express is 'Testing the Waters' of Bitcoin and the Blockchain,"American Express, through its venture capital arm American Express Ventures, is looking to use its recent investment in bitcoin remittance startup Abra's $12m Series A as a way to more closely observe the digital currency industry and the technology behind it.  AmEx Ventures  managing partner Harshul Sanghi told CoinDesk in a recent interview that, for the 165-year old company, it’s too soon to predict how it might leverage the technology or what use cases might take shape.  “It’s very, very early days for us, right? And ... we get to explore and see how the space is going to evolve,” he said.  In the meantime, AmEx will “test the waters” through its work with Abra, and in return, provide resources and advice to the startup.  Sanghi left the door open to support for bitcoin by American Express, stating:  “Let’s see what currencies are important and we’ll transact in the currencies that our customers want to transact in.”  However, he suggested other applications of the blockchain are more at the forefront of the company’s mind than bitcoin itself.  ""As we watch the digital currency industry develop, we have seen that blockchain technology and the distributed ledger can play an important role in shaping the future,” said Sanghi.  He thinks AmEx may consider making other investments in the digital currency space, tying such a prospect to how the technology progresses.  “I think as the technology continues to evolve, as others have in the past, we will look to see and make investments as appropriate and as relevant for us and our businesses,” the partner said.  Sanghi went on to say the user experience of the Abra app was a draw for American Express, reiterating that the company’s investment gives it a platform to explore the technology further.  “We think they have a unique platform in the way they’re leveraging the blockchain technology, and their goal market and how they’re looking to move forward,"" he said. ""And we think it was a good investment, a good company to partner with and see how the space evolves.”  Image Source: Nadalina / Shutterstock.com",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/10/23/how-american-express-is-testing-the-waters-of-bitcoin-and-the-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ed706141d969d5a121ea059770051307bee31662-2560x1919.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42398764,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgXfx,1445606155,"Barcelona to Launch Local Digital Currency, Reports Claim","Barcelona city council is reportedly working to launch its own digital currency in the next six months.  According to reports from El Pais, one of Spain's leading national newspapers, mayor Ada Colau's government is hoping the digital currency will stimulate local commerce.  Though it remains unclear whether the proposed currency is strictly a cryptocurrency, the council has said that users will be able to store their holdings in mobile wallets and exchange them into fiat.  In addition, civil workers will be able to receive part of their salary in the new digital currency. Businesses in the area will also be able to apply for digital currency micro-credits from the city council.  Fernando Restoy, the deputy governor of Spain's central bank said while he knew little about the project, he did not like the proposal. ""I think it is impossible as well as undesirable,"" he said.  The proposal comes after the New Economics Foundation, an independent economic think tank, said Scotland should consider creating its own digital currency: the 'ScotPound'.  CoinDesk reached out to Ada Colau's party for comment but no reply had been received by press time.

42398763,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgXgw,1445598788,Software School Tackles Fake Degrees Using the Blockchain,"San Francisco's new software engineering school, Holberton, has announced it will tackle fake degrees using bitcoin technology.  In partnership with Bitproof, the notary startup founded by teenager Louison Dumont, Holberton will issue every graduate with certificate that can be verified on bitcoin's blockchain using a Digital Certificate Number (DCN).  While statistics on the prevalence of fake college degrees is thin on the ground, 86% of employers in a recent survey said they'd found candidates lying on their CV. In addition, fake certificates are widely available and cheap to buy.  Inserting degree information into the blockchain could be a faster, cheaper solution for employers, said Sylvain Kalache, the co-founder of Holberton School:  ""It is much more efficient, secure, and simple than what you can find today in the industry. We think first about our students – we want to make sure that our certificates will always remain valid and verifiable by employers. It will also keep them safe and impossible to copy or hack.""  ""The blockchain is the future of certification, and we believe that in the following years, more schools will use the public blockchain to secure their certificates and diplomas,"" he added.  Indeed, The University of Nicosia began issuing blockchain-verifiable certificates for its introductory MOOC last September, while others have been adding the technology into the classroom.  Holberton School launchedhttps://www.linux.com/news/enterprise/biz-enterprise/859434-industry-veterans-come-together-to-create-a-school-for-software-engineers earlier this month, following a $2m seed round from Silicon Valley's elite, to address the shortage of programmers. An alternative to traditional theory-driven courses, it aims to build 32 'full stack' engineers in two years.  Students in the first intake this coming January will spend their first day at Holberton building their own PC.
