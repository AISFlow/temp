Ripple (XRP) has reclaimed its bullish momentum, surging past key resistance levels and positioning itself for a strong breakout. Meanwhile, Polkadot (DOT), despite showing technical promise, struggles to break free from its bearish grip, leaving traders and analysts divided on its immediate future. Amid this dynamic landscape, Qubetics ($TICS) is making waves as a groundbreaking presale project. Backed by a high-profile partnership with SWFT Blockchain, Qubetics is redefining the blockchain wallet ecosystem and expanding into untapped territories like Real World Asset Tokenisation. With over 374 million tokens sold, Qubetics is quickly becoming a hot topic in crypto circles. Let‚Äôs dive deeper into these three standout projects‚ÄîQubetics, Ripple, and Polkadot‚Äîto understand why they‚Äôre among the best crypto to join this week and how each is carving its niche in the blockchain ecosystem. Qubetics: A Revolution in Blockchain Utility The buzz around Qubetics is palpable, and for good reason. As the world‚Äôs first Web3 aggregator, it aims to bridge real-world applications with blockchain innovation. The recent partnership with SWFT Blockchain has turbocharged its wallet features, offering lightning-fast cross-chain swaps and unmatched security. But the star of the show is its Real World Asset Tokenisation Marketplace. Real World Asset Tokenisation Marketplace: A Game-Changer Imagine a system where property, art, or even corporate bonds can be tokenised and traded on a decentralised platform. That‚Äôs precisely what Qubetics is bringing to the table. With this feature, businesses and individuals can turn tangible assets into digital tokens, unlocking liquidity and facilitating seamless global transactions. Picture a small business in Argentina seeking to expand operations. By tokenising a valuable piece of equipment or real estate, the business can attract international investors without the hurdles of traditional finance . Similarly, a professional in Brazil could use Qubetics to diversify their portfolio, owning fractional shares in assets previously out of reach. For individuals, the possibilities are equally exciting. A young entrepreneur in Chile could tokenise intellectual property, securing funding for a startup. This marketplace isn‚Äôt just a tool‚Äîit‚Äôs a paradigm shift, breaking barriers and democratising access to investment opportunities. Why Qubetics Shines Bright What makes Qubetics one of the best crypto to join this week is its ambitious vision paired with tangible solutions. It‚Äôs not just about hype; it‚Äôs about delivering real-world impact . With 374 million tokens already sold and over $7.7 million raised, the presale‚Äôs momentum is hard to ignore. Ripple: Riding the Bullish Wave Ripple, known for its focus on cross-border payments, has always been a strong player in the crypto world. Recently, XRP‚Äôs price action has reignited excitement, with the token stabilizing above $2.10 and setting sights on breaking the $2.30 resistance zone. XRP‚Äôs resurgence can be attributed to several factors. First, its stronghold in the financial sector, with partnerships spanning major banks and payment processors, reinforces its utility. Recent technical analysis reveals a bullish breakout above $2.20, with XRP trading at $2.25 and targeting the $2.30 resistance. This movement aligns with broader market trends, showcasing XRP‚Äôs resilience amid Bitcoin and Ethereum‚Äôs fluctuations. Analysts are optimistic that clearing the $2.30 hurdle could push XRP toward $2.50 or higher, reaffirming its relevance in the crypto landscape. Why Ripple Stands Out XRP‚Äôs focus on real-world applications, particularly in cross-border remittances, makes it an enduring favourite. Its ability to weather market volatility and emerge stronger underscores its potential as one of the best crypto to join this week. With technical and institutional support, Ripple is well-positioned for sustained growth. Polkadot: A Sleeping Giant? Polkadot has long been hailed for its innovative approach to blockchain interoperability. However, its recent price movements have left traders scratching their heads. Despite breaking out of a falling wedge pattern, DOT remains in bearish territory, currently trading at $6.83. Mixed Signals in the Market Polkadot‚Äôs technical indicators present a mixed bag. On the one hand, the falling wedge breakout suggests potential for a bullish reversal. On the other hand, resistance at $10.88 looms large, making traders wary. Social sentiment around Polkadot is growing, but it hasn‚Äôt translated into sustained upward momentum yet. One bright spot is the increased activity in Polkadot‚Äôs derivatives market, with long positions slightly outpacing shorts. This indicates some confidence among traders, but the road to a significant rally remains uncertain. Why Polkadot is Worth Watching While Polkadot may not be on an immediate upward trajectory, its robust ecosystem and focus on scalability make it a project with long-term potential. For those looking for diversification in their crypto portfolios, Polkadot remains a project to monitor closely. Understanding Real World Asset Tokenisation with Qubetics Asset tokenisation is not just a buzzword‚Äîit‚Äôs the future of finance. By converting physical assets into digital tokens, Qubetics enables seamless trading, increased liquidity, and broader access to investment opportunities. How It Works Qubetics‚Äô platform uses blockchain to create digital representations of assets, ensuring transparency, security, and efficiency. These tokens can be traded globally, bypassing traditional financial systems and their associated costs. Why It Matters This technology opens up new avenues for Latin American countries, where financial systems can be restrictive or volatile. Whether it‚Äôs securing loans, attracting foreign investment, or participating in global markets, tokenisation empowers individuals and businesses . The Final Thoughts Based on our research, Qubetics, Ripple, and Polkadot each bring unique value to the table. Qubetics stands out with its ambitious vision and real-world solutions, particularly its Real World Asset Tokenisation Marketplace. Ripple‚Äôs resurgence highlights its resilience and utility, making it a strong contender in the cross-border payments space. Meanwhile, Polkadot‚Äôs innovative approach to interoperability positions it as a long-term bet despite its current challenges. If you‚Äôre looking for the best crypto to join this week, Qubetics‚Äô ongoing presale is an opportunity worth exploring. With its focus on groundbreaking technology and real-world applications, it‚Äôs poised to redefine the blockchain landscape. Don‚Äôt miss your chance to be part of this transformative journey.

38074275,https://cryptonews.com/?p=322547,1735083470,Sui (SUI) Price Analysis ‚Äì Break Above $5.0 Imminent as On-chain Activity Booms,"The Sui (SUI) bulls remain very much in control on the eve of Christmas Day 2024, with the price last around $4.60, only just below the record highs it hit near $5.0 earlier in the month. SUI continues to find strong support upon retests of its major moving averages, including an impressive bounce last week from the 50DMA. That suggests appetite to buy the dip remains elevated, and pressure could be building for an explosive pop above the $5.0 level in the coming weeks. The bullish Sui price action shouldn‚Äôt come as a surprise against the backdrop of booming on-chain activity, souring trading volumes, and a fundamental backdrop that remain a strong tailwind for crypto markets going into 2025. Per DeFi Llama , the USD value of crypto locked in smart contracts on the Sui blockchain is at record highs near $1.8 billion, on-chain volumes are routinely clocking in in the $400 million to $600 million range, and perp volumes are trending back towards their highest levels of the year. Sui‚Äôs official X page recently tweeted a summary of the blockchain‚Äôs bumper year of growth. 2024 was so awesome for the Sui community, words just aren't enough‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶so we decided to use numbers! And trust us, the numbers in this recap are truly impressive pic.twitter.com/W8DwuRYHeh ‚Äî Sui (@SuiNetwork) December 23, 2024 Meanwhile, though Fed caused a stir in risk assets when it signaled fewer rate cuts in 2025 than the market had been anticipating last week, hopes remain high that the pro-crypto incoming Trump administration and Congress is going to usher in a new golden era for the crypto industry and markets in the US, accelerating global adoption. Bitcoin will steal most of the headlines in 2025 given the potential establishment of a US Bitcoin strategic reserve . However, high performing chains like Sui are also primed to explode. Schwab says #Bitcoin could hit $500K‚Äì$1M when Trump establishes a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. pic.twitter.com/3cArfgRYTU ‚Äî Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) December 6, 2024 Where Next for the Sui (SUI) Price? All that being said, a near-term breakout to the north of $5.0 seems highly likely for the Sui price. But with Sui already in a phase of price discovery, there aren‚Äôt too many easily identifiable price targets for the crypto. A 2x rally to $10 is certainly a possibility. But considering Sui‚Äôs current market cap of around $46 billion fully diluted ($13.5 billion circulating), much greater than 2x gains could be in store for the crypto. Sui is currently proving itself as one of the best performing layer-1 protocols in the game, and there is scope for significant catch up to its larger rivals like Solana and Ethereum. Solana‚Äôs fully diluted market cap was last around $116 billion, while Ethereum‚Äôs was last $420 billion, with both also likely to expand significantly in 2025. Could Sui also reach a fully diluted valuation in the hundreds of billions this cycle? It‚Äôs certainly a possibility, assuming its chain continues to lead in terms of web3 adoption, as is currently the case. A Sui price in the $20 range becomes a realistic target with if assumptions hold. That means its a strong candidate for best crypto to buy now . Of course, crypto investors would be best served by spreading their portfolio across a few high-potential coins. Bitcoin could still post 2x gains next year, or even more if strategic reserves gain ground. Other leading tokens like Ethereum and Solana are also likely to perform very well. But Sui is certainly a great addition to any investor‚Äôs crypto portfolio.

Table of Contents XRP breaks $1 barrier permanently Cardano‚Äôs rise amid market shifts Lightchain AI to transform blockchain technology Why Lightchain AI could steal the spotlight A seasoned trader has declared XRP‚Äôs price is now firmly anchored above $1, signaling strong momentum for the token. While XRP celebrates this milestone, the spotlight is shifting toward Cardano (ADA) and Lightchain AI (LCAI) , two projects poised for explosive growth. Cardano‚Äôs consistent development and robust ecosystem continue to attract attention, but it‚Äôs Lightchain AI, priced at just $0.003 during its presale, that‚Äôs stealing headlines. With unique technologies like Proof of Intelligence (PoI) and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), LCAI is redefining blockchain and AI, offering unmatched growth potential. XRP breaks $1 barrier permanently XRP, the cryptocurrency issued by Ripple, recently surged above the $1 mark. This significant increase has been attributed to several factors: Regulatory developments ‚Äì The New York Department of Financial Services approved Ripple‚Äôs stablecoin, RLUSD, pegged to the U.S. dollar. This approval is expected to enhance XRP‚Äôs value and utility within Ripple‚Äôs digital payments platform. Political climate ‚Äì The election of President Donald Trump has led to expectations of a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment. Trump‚Äôs appointment of Paul Atkins, known for his supportive stance on cryptocurrencies, as SEC head may ease previous legal challenges faced by Ripple. Analysts are optimistic about XRP‚Äôs future, with some predicting that it could reach a price range of $5 to $7 in the first half of 2025. However, investors should remain cautious, as the cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility. Cardano‚Äôs rise amid market shifts In the middle of new market changes, Cardano (ADA) has shown great rise. Over the last four days ADA‚Äôs price jumped by 32%, making its market value $14.932 billion and firming it as ninth-largest coin by market value. This big rise shows more interest and trust in Cardano from investors. Additionally, money rates for Cardano have gotten a clear lift. This shows more hope among traders. People are happy to pay extra for long bets, which mÕèeans they think prices will go up some more. These changes show Cardano‚Äôs ability to take advantage of market speed and make itself a strong player in the changing crypto world. You might also like: Analysts: This altcoin has the potential to surpass established cryptos Lightchain AI to transform blockchain technology Lightchain AI is emerging as a transformative force in the blockchain space by seeking to seamlessly integrate artificial intelligence into decentralized ecosystems. At the heart of its technology lies the Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism, which is set to redefine blockchain validation. Unlike traditional methods like Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS), PoI will incentivize nodes to perform meaningful AI computations, such as model training and inference.

The LCAI token will serve multiple roles, including payments for AI services, staking for governance, and accessing premium AIVM features. Its distribution ensures fairness, allocating tokens to early contributors, ecosystem growth, and community rewards. With adaptive inflation and deflationary mechanisms, the platform balances token scarcity and value appreciation over time. Dynamic pricing for AI tasks and a sustainability fund further enhance economic stability. This thoughtful design ensures LCAI incentivizes participation, supports scalability, and aligns stakeholder interests with long-term ecosystem success. The roadmap: Phase 1: Prototype development Develop PoI consensus and AIVM. Establish decentralized governance frameworks. Phase 2: Testnet rollout Deploy testnet for real-world testing.

Bennett shared that she started her research in mid-2014 and hasn‚Äôt stopped since. ‚ÄúOver the years key themes associated with blockchain technology have emerged that were frequently taken at surface value by IT and business teams in enterprises,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI spent lots of time explaining to clients (and non-clients, for that matter) what was myth and what was reality.‚Äù Although blockchain has matured greatly over the years, Bennett believes that the myths listed below continue to persist ‚Äì here‚Äôs why: The Blockchain Exists The Forrester report notes that phrases such as ‚Äúthe blockchain will address that‚Äù or ‚Äúputting something on the blockchain‚Äù create confusion. This is why it‚Äôs worth stressing that the blockchain doesn‚Äôt actually ‚Äúexist.‚Äù The report states that ‚Äúblockchain is an architectural principle that features certain characteristics.‚Äù It also states that the underlying concept of blockchain can be realized differently. For instance, there are dozens of public, permissionless blockchain networks, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. A wide variety of open-source and proprietary protocols are also available to build permissioned networks. In addition, there are semi-public and hybrid networks whose governance models offer a blend of permissioned and permissionless functions. ‚ÄúMany software offerings aren‚Äôt blockchains by any stretch of the imagination because they don‚Äôt use blocks,‚Äù the report notes. ‚ÄúHowever, these offerings label themselves as such.‚Äù Blockchains Disintermediate And Trusted Third Parties Are No Longer Needed The second myth is that blockchain networks won‚Äôt ever fully disintermediate. While blockchain networks support the direct transfer of value between two parties, third parties are still needed for enterprise blockchain use cases. ‚ÄúThe only way to cut out third parties altogether is for consumers or businesses to self-custody their wallets and interact with a blockchain directly, which is not a realistic proposition for mainstream business relationships,‚Äù the report states. ‚ÄúEven in scenarios where ecosystem partners deal directly with each other at the expense of existing third parties, it doesn‚Äôt mean third parties are no longer part of the mix.‚Äù The document adds that cryptocurrency use cases rely on third parties, such as wallet providers, exchanges, and custody services. Blockchains Are Decentralized Third on the list of myths is that blockchains are decentralized. However, decentralization is more complex than it may seem. decentralization is THE single most important tenet in crypto. without it, we‚Äôre really no different to traditional financial systems. ‚Äî TINA (@thetinaverse) December 23, 2024 ‚ÄúEven the public Bitcoin and Ethereum networks aren‚Äôt completely decentralized,‚Äù the report states. ‚ÄúOn the contrary, miners and core developers in effect exercise a form of central control, and those small groups aren‚Äôt accountable to anybody.‚Äù Findings also state that elements of centralization are present in cryptocurrencies and decentralized applications (Dapps) . As a result, it‚Äôs noted that the term ‚Äúdecentralization theater‚Äù has become popular for describing networks or applications that claim to be decentralized but aren‚Äôt. Blockchains Are Trustless While a blockchain network can facilitate the exchange of information between people or entities that do not know or trust each other, that doesn‚Äôt mean the technology is entirely trustless. According to the report, participants still trust the functioning of these networks. For example, participants need to trust the mathematics and cryptography, along with the network‚Äôs code. Users also need to trust those who effectively control the respective networks, such as those with the resources to add blocks to the chain and the developers who can modify the core code. Blockchains Are Immutable A key characteristic of a blockchain network is immutability, yet the report explains that this isn‚Äôt always the case and notes that for enterprises, immutability isn‚Äôt always desirable. According to the report, changes can be made to the blockchain. ‚ÄúOne is to recompute the chain, either in its entirety or to the point before an undesirable event occurred; this erases and recreates history,‚Äù the report states. ‚ÄúThe other is to fork the chain, which preserves historical code and transactions but means the software now works differently, and ownership may have been reassigned.‚Äù Blockchains Are Inherently More Secure The report also points out that blockchains may not be more secure unless these features are designed into the network . For instance, in some cases, participants will have access to credentials to access a network. This creates a security vulnerability. Even networks with multiple nodes are susceptible to attacks. Nodes are the backbone of blockchain. Verifying transactions, ensuring security, and powering decentralization‚Äîevery node is a piece of freedom in Web3. Want to truly support the crypto revolution? Run a node and join the movement. #Blockchain #Crypto #Decentralization pic.twitter.com/A4GFTbbGGS ‚Äî Oleksandr Bagnyuk (@AlexBagnyuk) December 15, 2024 ‚ÄúThe more nodes there are in the network, the more choices there are for somebody with evil intent to find one that‚Äôs less well protected,‚Äù the report states. Blockchains Are ‚ÄúTruth Machines‚Äù While blockchains may be viewed as single sources of truth, malicious actors can still take over. The report points out that if somebody registers property ownership, the system can‚Äôt tell whether this is really the rightful owner. ‚ÄúSimilarly, it can‚Äôt tell whether the consent for data usage has been obtained legitimately,‚Äù the report states. ‚ÄúSensor data can be manipulated, either by tampering with the sensor itself or by intercepting the data stream.‚Äù Blockchains Automatically Improve Data Quality Although blockchain networks work well for ensuring data integrity, the report highlights that data quality issues must be addressed before information is written on the blockchain. The same applies to data that triggers a smart contract. ‚ÄúIf nobody establishes and ensures the required data quality standards before the network launches or data is written to a blockchain-supported back end in a centrally controlled service, the shortcoming will be obvious very soon,‚Äù the report notes. Transparency Can Only Be Good All transactions on the blockchain are transparent, but this isn‚Äôt always beneficial for enterprises. Given this, the report notes that confidentiality is the biggest technical challenge developers need to resolve. Although progress has been made around confidentiality-preserving mechanisms, these remain complex. ‚ÄúAlgorithmic zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) ‚Äî aren‚Äôt ready for enterprise prime time,‚Äù the report states. S mart Contracts Will Make Lawyers Redundant The myth that smart contracts will replace lawyers is addressed as myth number 10. While smart contracts are able to automate certain processes , the report notes that ‚Äúcode is not law.‚Äù ‚ÄúEven if participants in a network wish to abide by the results of smart contract execution, they still need a separate legal agreement that states as much and captures other standard contractual principles,‚Äù the report states. Build It, And They Will Come As blockchain technology matures, enterprises are thought to be more likely to adopt solutions. This may not be the case, though. The report notes that between June 2022 and January 2024, many enterprise blockchain initiatives ended in failure. Fortunately, decision-makers who want to avoid a similar fate are now realizing key lessons. According to the report, enterprises must consider ecosystem partners‚Äô and customers‚Äô needs and wants. Businesses using blockchain solutions should not expect a commercial model to develop organically. Finally, enterprises should conduct in-depth research on blockchain software before implementing a solution. The report warns that large businesses must proceed carefully when using blockchain technology. ‚ÄúA key contributor to the failure of TradeLens was Maersk‚Äôs dominant position in the market. Even if everything else had been just so (which it wasn‚Äôt), Maersk‚Äôs sheer size concerned smaller ecosystem participants, which feared Maersk would learn too much about them, while Maersk‚Äôs major competitors weren‚Äôt that interested in becoming part of a Maersk-led network, despite IBM‚Äôs participation,‚Äù the report states.

Donald Saves Crypto (DONALCRY), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONALCRY is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Saves Crypto can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Saves Crypto could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Saves Crypto launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Saves Crypto on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald Saves Crypto by entering its contract address ‚Äì Gyy3ss5Yj2ioZWuz6BNbDPGUGUxhwoCskRuU2cGo9k2Q ‚Äì in the receiving field.

38071211,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=314053,1735081270,Russian Government To Ban Bitcoin Mining in 10 Different Regions Due to Energy Shortages: Report,"Russian authorities reportedly plan to prohibit cryptocurrency mining in 10 regions and impose seasonal restrictions in three others beginning January 1, 2025, amid growing concerns over energy shortages. According to a new report from the state-controlled TASS, the complete ban will affect regions including Dagestan, Ingushetia, Kabardino-Balkaria, Karachay-Cherkessia, North Ossetia, Chechnya, and the recently annexed territories of Donetsk, Lugansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. The prohibition is reported to remain in effect until March 15, 2031. In addition, three Siberian regions ‚Äî Irkutsk, Buryatia and Zabaikalsky ‚Äî will face seasonal mining restrictions during peak energy consumption periods. These limitations will run from January to mid-March 2025, expanding to November through March in subsequent years. The measures follow cryptocurrency mining legislation signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin in late 2024, aimed at preventing power shortages and blackouts. The energy-intensive nature of proof-of-work crypto mining has reportedly strained Russia‚Äôs power grid, particularly in regions with limited infrastructure, according to TASS. Both individual miners and mining pools must cease operations during restricted periods, marking Russia‚Äôs most aggressive step yet to address its energy challenges while maintaining economic stability.

On-chain metrics indicate a notable shift in exchange activity, with Tether (USDT) seeing significant outflows while Bitcoin (BTC) inflows into exchanges remain elevated.

However, Onatt noted that while these indicators suggest short-term downside risk, there appears to be no significant macroeconomic catalyst to drive a prolonged bearish trend. The analyst particularly wrote: This combination of factors may indicate a potential for further short-term downside in Bitcoin‚Äôs price. However, from a macroeconomic perspective, there doesn‚Äôt appear to be a catalyst that would necessitate a prolonged bearish trend after this short-term correction. Key Indicators Suggest Mixed Signals in the Bitcoin Market TraderOasis, another analyst, highlighted additional metrics influencing Bitcoin‚Äôs price behavior. One key observation focused on the Coinbase Premium Index, which failed to follow Bitcoin‚Äôs upward movement during its last price surge. Oasis noted: As a result, the price retreated. We are now in negative territory. I expect a break in the market for the continuation of the rise. Notably, this disconnect indicates a lack of strong buying activity from US-based investors, often considered a significant driver of Bitcoin‚Äôs upward momentum. The analyst also noted that the funding rates have started to decline while open interest levels have been rising. Falling funding rates coupled with rising open interest typically indicate that traders are opening more short positions. This pattern suggests bearish sentiment in the derivatives market, with traders expecting a continuation of the downward trend or, at best, a period of sideways movement.

38074272,https://cryptonews.com/?p=322348,1735080979,Argentina Freezes $3.5M USDT Linked to Rainbowex Ponzi Scheme: Report,"Argentine authorities have taken decisive action against Rainbowex, an alleged Ponzi scheme that defrauded thousands of investors, primarily in Buenos Aires‚Äô San Pedro region. A judicial order compelled Tether, the issuer of USDT, to freeze approximately $3.5 million in cryptocurrency linked to the platform on December 24. The investigation into Rainbowex has led to multiple raids, arrests, and international warrants. Source: iProup Rainbowex Ponzi Scheme Busted: How $3.5M USDT Was Frozen Following Multiple Arrests and Raids According to the source close to the case , the legal action to freeze Rainbowex‚Äôs digital assets follows months of intensive investigation and enforcement operations. Argentine law enforcement agencies conducted over 15 raids nationwide, targeting locations associated with Rainbowex and its operators. As a result, four individuals, including Luis Pardo, Maximiliano Braga, Facundo Villalba, Mariano Diez, and Andr√©s Desanzo, were apprehended. An additional arrest warrant was issued for Alexis Pan, who remains at large. The authorities‚Äô efforts also extended beyond Argentina, as the Buenos Aires Justice Department coordinated with Interpol to issue red notices for two Malaysian nationals believed to be key figures behind the scheme. The raids yielded important evidence of the scheme‚Äôs operations, including the seizure of 30 million pesos (worth approximately $1.48M) in cash, distributed across various currencies such as dollars, yuan, and euros. This crypto seizure is yet one of the biggest this year. Investigations revealed that Rainbowex posed as a legitimate crypto investment platform, promising substantial returns. However, investors began reporting issues when they attempted to withdraw their funds, which ultimately exposed the platform as a fraudulent closed-loop system disconnected from public blockchains. The Role of Tether and the Controversy of USDT Blacklisting It was noted that Tether‚Äôs ability to blacklist wallets implicated in illicit activities helped largely in the asset freeze process. Following a court order, Tether disabled transactions for the wallet holding Rainbowex‚Äôs USDT, which effectively froze all the funds. Rodrigo Mansilla, a blockchain expert, explained that the blacklisting process renders any transaction‚Äîwhether sending or receiving USDT‚Äîimpossible once a wallet is flagged. This functionality, embedded in the USDT smart contract, checks the wallet‚Äôs status before permitting transactions. If the address is blacklisted, the contract sets a boolean value to ‚Äúfalse,‚Äù blocking any movement of assets. While this mechanism is lauded as a critical tool for law enforcement, it has sparked debate over the decentralization of stablecoins. ‚ÄúThis centralized blocking capability calls into question the supposed decentralization of USDT, even when stored on a decentralized blockchain,‚Äù Mansilla expressed. Mansilla pointed out that although USDT operates on decentralized blockchains, Tether‚Äôs ability to control it centrally contradicts the core principles of decentralization. Maximiliano Firtman, a computer specialist, shared a similar sentiment on the blacklisting process, noting that Tether‚Äôs ability to freeze assets indefinitely raises concerns about the potential for permanent loss of funds. However, Firtman also indicated that Tether could mint new tokens to replace the frozen USDT and transfer them to a wallet designated by the judiciary, potentially mitigating the impact on victims. The collaboration between public authorities and the private sector was instrumental in advancing the investigation. Lemon exchange, alongside blockchain analysis firms Chainalysis and Qlue, provided technical expertise and access to critical data. Judicial sources also confirmed that these companies shared extensive database information, which enabled authorities to track Rainbowex‚Äôs financial movements and build a robust case. An earlier report in October revealed that up to 20,000 people had reportedly invested in a fraudulent USDT-themed crypto scheme from RainbowEx .

38070589,https://crypto.news/?p=14322080,1735080215,Which crypto will explode in 2025? Top coins poised for massive growth,"With Donald Trump‚Äôs victory in the U.S. elections, the cryptocurrency market has entered a strong growth phase, reigniting excitement across the space. A long-awaited milestone has been achieved with Bitcoin ‚Äî its price has soared past the $106,000 mark. The crypto bull market is in full swing, leaving everyone wondering: what‚Äôs next? Which coin will explode in 2025? And which crypto has 1000x potential? Here‚Äôs a guide to the crypto coins to watch as we head into next year. Table of Contents The criteria for a crypto explosion Top cryptocurrencies likely to explode in 2025 Expert predictions for 2025 Risks and considerations The criteria for a crypto explosion With more than 10,000 cryptocurrencies out there today, only a small portion ever achieve real success. Why? The key lies in their utility, scalability, and adoption. Cryptos that succeed often focus on offering something useful, whether that‚Äôs speeding up transactions, cutting down on fees, or boosting privacy. For instance, projects that support decentralized finance or enable smart contracts often gain traction due to their innovative applications. You might also like: What is DeFi? Understanding Decentralized Finance and its uses A crypto‚Äôs success depends heavily on scalability ‚Äî blockchains that can process lots of transactions without slowing down or hiking up costs stand out. This reliability makes them more attractive as demand for seamless digital transactions grows. Strong community support, solid partnerships, and strategic market positioning drive adoption, bolstered by a transparent and experienced development team. Cryptos that are decentralized attract users looking for security, privacy, and control, as no single entity has all the power. This openness builds trust and transparency. Centralized cryptos, on the other hand, often spark concerns about control and transparency since one entity holds the reins. Many users prefer decentralization for its autonomy and lower risk of manipulation. Without these foundational elements, many cryptocurrencies simply fail to stand out in the increasingly crowded market. Top cryptocurrencies likely to explode in 2025 Which cryptocurrency will explode in 2025? As the market evolves, certain coins show immense potential for rapid growth. Here are some crypto coins to watch. Ethereum Ethereum 1-day chart, December 2024 | Source: crypto.news Ethereum‚Äôs dominance in the blockchain space is clear, with its key role in powering decentralized applications and smart contracts. With the rise of DeFi and NFTs , Ethereum ( ETH ) is well-positioned to retain its dominant position. After transitioning to Ethereum 2.0 in 2022, the network‚Äôs scalability and energy efficiency have improved, allowing it to handle more transactions without compromising security. Looking ahead, the Pectra upgrade planned for 2025 will enhance Ethereum‚Äôs scalability even further, enabling it to process more transactions and introducing innovative features like social recovery for wallet access. This is expected to make Ethereum even more robust, positioning it for future growth in a rapidly evolving blockchain landscape. Solana Solana 1-day chart, December 2024 | Source: crypto.news Solana ( SOL ) continues to make waves in the blockchain space, standing out for its impressive transaction speed and low fees, which are attracting developers across various industries. The network‚Äôs growing presence in decentralized finance and gaming underscores its potential to emerge as a leading force. While it has faced some network issues in the past, Solana‚Äôs ongoing upgrades in scalability and developer tools are enhancing its ecosystem. With its unique ability to process transactions quickly and an expanding user base, Solana is well-positioned for continued success in 2025‚Äã. Chainlink Chainlink 1-day chart, December 2024 | Source: crypto.news Chainlink ( LINK ) is a decentralized oracle network that plays a crucial role in connecting blockchains with real-world data. Its ability to securely transmit external information to smart contracts makes it invaluable to the blockchain ecosystem. With expanding partnerships and increasing use in DeFi and smart contracts, Chainlink is on a strong growth trajectory. As the demand for blockchain-based data services continues to rise, Chainlink is well-positioned to see significant upside potential. Chainlink‚Äôs growing adoption, including partnerships with major companies like Google Cloud, SWIFT, and the World Economic Forum, showcases its increasing importance. As demand for decentralized data services grows, Chainlink‚Äôs unique position in blockchain infrastructure positions it for significant growth, especially as blockchain technology expands into more industries. Expert predictions for 2025 As 2025 approaches, experts present a range of predictions for Ethereum, highlighting its critical role in the evolving cryptocurrency space. Some foresee ETH breaking new records, possibly surpassing $5,000, fueled by growing demand and its limited supply dynamics. Other projections are more optimistic, envisioning ETH prices potentially crossing $10,000, fueled by institutional interest and strong market fundamentals. Predictions for Chainlink‚Äôs performance in 2025 vary, reflecting the unpredictable nature of the crypto market. Analysts suggest that LINK could climb to a range of $30.69 to $38.26 by year-end, driven by growing adoption and ongoing technological advancements. Others, like Nick Petisce, suggest a more optimistic outlook, proposing that LINK could soar to $2,000-$6,000 within the next 3-5 years, driven by the adoption of Chainlink‚Äôs Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) and partnerships with major financial institutions. Similarly, Solana has garnered attention for its high transaction speeds and low fees, attracting developers across various industries. While specific 2025 price predictions for SOL are less prevalent, the network‚Äôs growing presence in decentralized finance and gaming underscores its potential to emerge as a leading force in the blockchain space. Ongoing upgrades in scalability and developer tools are enhancing its ecosystem, positioning Solana for continued success in the coming years. Risks and considerations Investing in cryptocurrency can be rewarding, but it comes with considerable risks. Even strong projects like Ethereum, Solana, and Chainlink are not exempt from market turbulence or external disruptions like regulatory crackdowns. Price volatility can lead to significant losses if you‚Äôre not prepared. Predictions from experts offer guidance but don‚Äôt guarantee outcomes. Additionally, the crypto space often attracts fraudulent schemes, making due diligence crucial. Take time to analyze each coin‚Äôs fundamentals, consider its long-term potential, and never invest money you can‚Äôt afford to lose. Spread your investments across multiple assets, avoid high-risk trades, and ensure that your financial health isn‚Äôt jeopardized.

Its seamless integration with DeFi and NFT platforms bolsters its status as a top crypto pick for 2025. If innovation and growth potential are what you seek, BlockDAG deserves your attention. 2. Ripple (XRP): Enhancing Speed & Reducing Costs Previously known as Ripple, XRP facilitates transactions across various real-world currencies. Priced at approximately $2.18, XRP has seen notable value growth this year. XRP employs a consensus algorithm that accelerates transactions and reduces costs. The decentralized XRP Ledger supports cross-border payments with minimal fees through a trust-less mechanism. Ripple has also launched a stablecoin, RLUSD, boosting its trading volumes.

Ethereum (ETH): Leading in dApps & DeFi Ethereum is a well-established decentralized blockchain platform that supports smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and decentralized finance (DeFi). The recent shift to Ethereum 2.0, adopting Proof of Stake (PoS), has enhanced its scalability and energy efficiency. Powered by its native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), and augmented by Layer 2 solutions, Ethereum streamlines transactions and reduces costs. With the current trading price around $3,336, forecasts indicate ETH could reach new peaks by 2025, affirming its position as a top investment choice. 4. Binance Coin (BNB): Fueling the Binance Ecosystem Binance Coin (BNB), valued at $676.60, reflects a significant increase over the past year. BNB is integral to the Binance ecosystem, offering trading fee discounts, and powers the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) that supports dApps and smart contracts. BNB‚Äôs utility spans DeFi applications, staking, and merchant payments. Currently nearing the $265.90 support level, analysts predict a rebound if this level holds, suggesting a strong future performance, making BNB a solid investment. 5. Solana (SOL): Fast Transactions with Low Fees Solana, priced at about $182.65 after a recent 23% drop, could see a turnaround if bullish momentum builds. Known for rapid transactions and low fees, Solana employs a unique Proof of History (PoH) system to enhance efficiency and scalability.

The last two days of the week saw total outflows of $1 billion. The recent price declines led to a $17.7 billion drop in the total assets under management (AuM) for Digital Asset ETPs, which is likely influenced by the hawkish stance of the Federal Reserve‚Äôs dot plot published on Wednesday. Bitcoin Posts Strong Inflows While these outflows are significant, it is also important to note that the figures represent only 0.37% of total AuM and rank as the 13th largest single-day outflow in history, according to the latest edition of CoinShares‚Äô Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report . In comparison, the largest single-day outflow occurred in mid-2022 when a $540 million outflow (2.3% of AuM) followed the Fed‚Äôs interest rate hike. Although Bitcoin saw some outflows during the week, it ended with net inflows of $375 million, indicating strong market sentiment. On the other hand, short-bitcoin products recorded only $0.4 million in inflows, reflecting a lack of significant interest from short-sellers. The ‚Äúmost dramatic‚Äù outflows came from multi-asset investment products, which saw a sharp decline of $121 million last week. On the altcoin front, XRP led the inflows with $8.8 million, followed by Horizen at $4.8 million and Polkadot at $1.9 million over the past week, showing a trend of investors favoring more selective opportunities. Chainlink, Cardano, and Litecoin also received modest inflows of $1.7 million, $0.7 million, and $0.6 million, respectively. Meanwhile, Ethereum continued its positive streak and attracted $51 million, while Solana experienced outflows of $8.7 million during the same period. Switzerland Faces Largest Digital Asset Outflows The US continued to lead in digital asset inflows, drawing $567 million over the past week. Brazil and Australia followed with $16.6 million and $10.2 million in inflows, respectively, while other regions saw outflows. Topping the chart with the most outflows during the same period was Switzerland recording $95.1 million, followed by Germany and Canada with $74.7 million and $60.1 million. Outflows were also recorded in Sweden and Hong Kong, with $42.1 million and $12.1 million, respectively.

He expected to see ‚Äúsubstantial growth‚Äù in the crypto ETF volume and inflows in 2025. OSL is allegedly Hong Kong‚Äôs largest custodian of local spot crypto ETFs with over 70% market share. Positive Sentiment to Influence Spot Crypto ETF Outlook Miller perceives that the sentiment surrounding the offering has improved significantly locally and globally. On this premise, he sees the future of spot crypto ETFs as brighter. Also, the OSL executive highlighted the incoming administration in the United States, citing that it will present a more favorable stance for the crypto industry. ‚ÄúThe new U.S. administration‚Äôs favorable stance toward the crypto industry, coupled with interest rate cuts, has positively impacted global sentiment and cryptocurrency prices,‚Äù Miller stated. Hong Kong Launch Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs In April 2024, Hong Kong welcomed Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) spot ETFs . Hong Kong became the first jurisdiction in Asia to issue a spot Ethereum ETF. Top firms like China Asset Management, Bosera Capital, and HashKey Capital Limited were endorsed by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) to launch Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. This was about four months after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) greenlighted BTC ETFs in America. On the debut trading day, Hong Kong crypto ETFs recorded a combined trading volume of approximately HK$87.5 million , equivalent to $11.2 million. US Spot Crypto ETFs Outperform its Hong Kong Counterparts The Bitcoin ETFs have up to 4,560 BTC, valued at approximately 444.6 million, as of Dec. 11, and the Ethereum funds hold up to 16,280 ETH ($59.6 million). Still, some entities evaluated the crypto ETFs as underwhelming. Compared to their US counterparts, they are grossly underperforming. The US spot crypto ETFs have a stellar record in terms of volume and inflows. These measures increased when pro-crypto Donald Trump won the election and was reelected as US President. As of early December, US spot Bitcoin ETFs already had a cumulative net inflow of over $34.06 billion, while its Ethereum counterparts saw over $1.78 billion.

Daddy Pepe (DADDPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 11,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DADDPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Daddy Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Daddy Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Daddy Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Daddy Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Daddy Pepe by entering its contract address ‚Äì 9UFnMabUe7wecdEEzAYPoQPZiuTJ1hTFpNz6qtsiB3FA ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner.

The exchange started when Hoskinson said, ‚ÄúWelcome to the new economy,‚Äù in a post about a YouTuber, Zara Dar, who left academia for OnlyFans. The AI bot then continued comparing Dar‚Äôs changing career path to the problem that the Cardano team is facing with the smart contract.¬†The bot criticized Cardano‚Äôs progress, stating,¬†‚ÄúBruh, you running Cardano like she running that PhD.‚Äù It also stated that Cardano has not fully developed working smart contracts. Hoskinson asked the bot questions and demanded it back up its claims. In response to the question, the bot changed the focus and said, ‚ÄúYour TPS is so low my response might take till 2025 to process.‚Äù Viral debate highlights AI bot‚Äôs nature The interaction attracted much attention online, and this was because Hoskinson may not have known that he was conversing with a bot. When a user in the community exposed RoastMaster9000 to be a bot, Hoskinson playfully likened his style to Captain Kirk of Star Trek. In different situations, Kirk, the main character of the series, usually beat AI using their own logic. The HOSKY meme coin account linked to the further replied, ‚ÄúBot 2 Charles 0,‚Äù continuing the lighthearted banter. Hoskinson later admitted that he started wondering what the bot was capable of doing as soon as he realized it was an AI. ‚ÄúI have not seen a bot like this one,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI was naturally curious of how advanced it could be before it loops and deflects.‚Äù After the debate, Hoskinson revealed a project called Me-Box at Input Output Global (IOG), which is still in progress. This initiative is aimed at designing avatars of people for social communication. Hoskinson said he was curious about RoastMaster9000, which is the same as his interest in this project. Cardano (ADA) faces correction The price of Cardano‚Äôs ADA fluctuated considerably after a strong rally in November and early December. The cryptocurrency peaked at $1.30 in the first week of December before experiencing a pullback. Currently, ADA is trading at $0.9281 and has had a weekly loss of 13.71% and a 24-hour loss of 0.96%. ADA has a market capitalization of $ 32.64 billion and 35.12 billion tokens in circulation. Nevertheless, ADA retains the leading position in the market, and bearish pressure persists in the asset‚Äôs pricing. Crypto analyst Zen has noted ADA has a chance of a further bounce back in early 2025. Zen argues that the recent correction could boost the bull run. Similarly, analyst Ali Martinez has compared the current ADA market chart to the 2020 cycle and found similarities that suggest future price increases. In addition to the price dynamics, Cardano‚Äôs ecosystem is still being developed. Charles Hoskinson recently complimented Ripple Labs‚Äô Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, calling him ‚Äúsmart and passionate.‚Äù This has led to the speculation of a possible collaboration between the two blockchains.

Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index Has Plunged To -0.221% In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, an analyst talked about the latest development in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index. The ‚ÄúCoinbase Premium Index‚Äù refers to a metric that keeps track of the percentage difference between the BTC price on Coinbase (USD pair) and that on Binance (USDT pair). When the value of this metric is positive, it means the cryptocurrency is trading at a higher rate on Coinbase than on Binance. Such a trend implies there is a higher buying pressure or a lower selling pressure present on the former as compared to the latter. Related Reading: Dogecoin & Other Memecoins No Longer Grabbing Social Media Attention: Santiment On the other hand, the indicator being under the zero mark suggests that Binance users are participating in a higher amount of buying than Coinbase ones as they have pushed BTC to a higher value there. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index over the last few months: From the graph, it‚Äôs visible that the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index has seen a sharp decline into the negative region recently, meaning that sellers have appeared on Coinbase. Alongside this selling, the BTC price has also witnessed a decline, which would suggest the negative premium could be the source of it. The cryptocurrency has actually been following the indicator in this manner throughout the year, with its price going up and down alongside buying and selling shifts on Coinbase. The reason behind this relationship potentially lies in the fact that Coinbase is home to US-based institutional investors, who have had a significant presence in the market this year. The Coinbase Premium Index being red right now would naturally imply these giant investors are selling. Considering that BTC‚Äôs price has been following the metric, this would be a bearish signal for the asset. There exists another pattern, however, that could imply a different outcome for Bitcoin. As the quant has highlighted in the chart, the metric has seen a rebound whenever its value has gone to the -0.2% mark during the past year. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Top Above $168,500 Based On This Indicator, Analyst Reveals The explanation behind the pattern may be that it‚Äôs usually around this level of selling that new buyers show up and decide to accumulate on the dip, pushing the metric as well as the price up in the process. The current value of the indicator is sitting at -0.221%, so it‚Äôs possible that Bitcoin could be close to reaching a bottom, if it hasn‚Äôt already formed one. This would only be, of course, if the institutional investors think that the bull run is still on. BTC Price Bitcoin briefly went under the $93,000 level yesterday, but it seems the coin has found a rebound as its price is now trading around $94,100.

The MIT study highlights that there are at least four stages in AI advancement by enterprises, and as these stages advance, so does the overall financial performance as well. MIT says most companies are working through the initial stages According to the MIT Center for Information System Research (CISR) study which analyzed 721 companies, most enterprises are still working through the first two stages of AI advancement. The study‚Äôs authors led by Peter Weill and Stephanie Woerner, both with MIT showed that these companies had financial performance below the industry average. But businesses in the third and fourth stages of AI maturity however exhibited a financial performance above the industry average, exceeding 10 percentage points, according to the authors. Of the surveyed companies, 28% were in the first stage, which was also categorized as experiment and prepare stage, where leaders look at addressing concerns such as ethics and skills to ensure a smooth path forward. ‚ÄúIn this stage, enterprises focus on educating their workforce, formulating AI policies, becoming more evidence-based, and experimenting with AI technologies to grow more comfortable with automated decision-making,‚Äù explained the researchers. The study also revealed that 34% of the enterprises were in the second stage which is characterized by building pilots and capabilities. At this stage, according to the study, enterprises start to ‚Äúdefine important metrics, begin to simplify and automate business processes, and develop the enterprise capabilities they‚Äôve learned.‚Äù It is also at this stage that use cases are piloted, and work on leveraging enterprise data and developing APIs. According to the study, companies in this second stage averaged 2.2 percentage points below the industry average. Foundation and SLMs start surfacing in the later stages According to the study, at least 31% of the surveyed firms were in the third stage, which is where enterprises start to develop AI-driven ways of working. During the third stage, foundation models and small language models (SLMs) are introduced and applied to enterprise opportunities. It is at this stage that AI becomes industrialized, that is, it becomes available and replicable across the business. According to the study, this stage involves work on building a core platform for AI, bearing in mind issues of transparency to decision-makers via dashboards, subsequently transforming the organizational culture to enhance innovative and data-driven thinking. The study also found that firms in this third stage averaged 8.7 percentage points above the industry average. According to the MIT team, the fourth and final stage is where companies become AI future-ready. This stage accounted for 7% of the total companies surveyed.

Buterin donated a large amount to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply, boosting SHIB‚Äôs prominence. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB can develop applications like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange.

It serves as a community coin, airdropping 50% of its supply to Solana‚Äôs NFT and DeFi participants. BONK surged over 100% after a Coinbase listing.

38068064,https://btc-pulse.com/?p=27837,1735075996,La Rosa Holdings to Offer Bitcoin for Real Estate Commission Payments,"Advancing Crypto Payments for Real Estate Commissions La Rosa Holdings announced a plan to allow Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as options to pay commissions, in an agreement with the real estate services company listed on NASDAQ. This was because of the increasing demand for flexible blockchain-enabled payment solutions, so this could mark a milestone for the industry. The initiative includes a 2% processing fee for agents opting to use crypto payments. While this provides an additional revenue stream for La Rosa Holdings, it primarily caters to agents seeking alternatives to traditional financial systems. The company believes this will empower brokers and modernize real estate transactions, aligning with the ongoing fintech revolution. Why Bitcoin in Real Estate? Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have a number of added advantages in real estate transactions, from faster times of processing to lower fees. By introducing this option, La Rosa Holdings hopes to capitalize on blockchain technology‚Äôs inherent efficiency and security. La Rosa‚Äôs CTO, Alex Santos, said of the innovation: ‚ÄúBlockchain technology offers unparalleled flexibility, enhancing the way agents and clients interact with the market‚Äù. The move epitomizes the commitment of the firm toward solutions that are both forward-thinking and pioneering, said Joe La Rosa, CEO. Faster transactions with minimized costs provide value not only for the agents but also for the clients. Growing Crypto Adoption in Real Estate The use of cryptocurrency in real estate is growing, with agents and firms trying to leverage the advantages of digital assets. From smart contracts to decentralized ledgers, blockchain technologies have already begun transforming how the industry operates. La Rosa Holdings is at the frontline of such a change. As the company continues to integrate crypto payments in service offerings, it places itself in the front row regarding fintech adoption in real estate. Operating in six service segments, this only furthers its reputation for always staying ahead of the curve. This is a wider acceptance of the currencies in the real estate markets, based on the industry report due to greater mainstream adoption across financial ecosystems. This, in any case, will not abate and creates an ability for early adopters such as La Rosa Holdings to influence what the future of property transaction will be. Conclusion This makes the vision of La Rosa Holdings highly prospective-to introduce Bitcoin to meet the ever-increasing demands of the market to adapt to crypto. By offering flexibility unmatchable by their contemporaries, smoothing and thinning transactions, the firm is ready to modernize real estate payments at lightning speed. As blockchain transforms industries, La Rosa Holdings remains on the frontlines of this transformative wave that‚Äôs making sure agents and clients benefit from the new era of financial innovation.",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,BTC Pulse,https://btc-pulse.com/la-rosa-holdings-to-offer-bitcoin-for-real-estate/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png
38068241,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=632996,1735075828,Elon Musk‚Äôs D.O.G.E could crash the US economy,"Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla, is co-leading the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) with Vivek Ramaswamy under the incoming administration of ‚Äòcrypto president‚Äô Donald Trump. The goal is to slash $2 trillion from federal spending. That‚Äôs nearly the size of the US government‚Äôs projected 2024 deficit. But here‚Äôs the thing, this project might not just fail ‚Äî it could crash the entire US economy. The pipe dream D.O.G.E isn‚Äôt even a real government department. It‚Äôs an advisory group. It can‚Äôt implement anything without Congress or Trump signing off. But Elon‚Äôs name carries weight. His involvement alone has turned this into more than a theoretical exercise. The plans are aggressive: massive layoffs, dissolving agencies, and gutting regulations. While Trump and his allies are cheering it on, skeptics are sounding alarms about the possible fallout. Elon and Vivek are eyeing a government workforce reduction of up to 75%. Three-quarters of federal employees could be shown the door if D.O.G.E‚Äôs vision is realized. But how realistic is this? Not very, say experts. Here‚Äôs why: about 75% of the federal budget is mandatory spending. Programs like Social Security and Medicare are untouchable without causing massive political backlash. That leaves only discretionary spending‚Äîabout $1.7 trillion‚Äîfor cuts. Half of that goes to defense, which Trump and his allies are unlikely to touch. What‚Äôs left are pennies compared to the grand $2 trillion ambition. Even the proposed savings from cutting inefficiencies (somewhere between $150 billion and $200 billion) are a drop in the ocean compared to the deficit. The math doesn‚Äôt add up. Government shutdown standoff Elon‚Äôs already flexing his political muscle, and it‚Äôs actually making Trump a bit nervous. Just weeks ago, the eccentric billionaire torpedoed a bipartisan deal to avoid a government shutdown. His fiery social media posts rallied Republican lawmakers to block the agreement. He called the appropriations excessive, labeling them as wasteful spending. This has heightened fears of a government shutdown as the holidays loom. If federal operations grind to a halt, the economic impact would be catastrophic. The 2018-2019 shutdown cost the economy $11 billion. Experts warn that a new shutdown could be even worse, especially with 2025‚Äôs inflation and interest rates outlook already creating a fragile economic environment. And Elon‚Äôs influence isn‚Äôt even official yet. Imagine what happens when Trump takes office, and D.O.G.E begins to push its proposals more aggressively. The risk of prolonged gridlock in Washington is growing, and the economy will be collateral damage. A debt crisis in the making For all its talk of efficiency, D.O.G.E might actually worsen the national debt. The US is already in deep. The national debt is over $36 trillion, and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects it will hit 166% of GDP by 2054. D.O.G.E‚Äôs proposals, if they fail to deliver real savings, could accelerate this trend. Here‚Äôs how it could play out. First, D.O.G.E‚Äôs $2 trillion savings target seems unachievable. If they miss the mark, the government will have no choice but to keep borrowing. That means higher interest payments on the debt, which are already consuming $880 billion a year‚Äî13% of the budget. Second, Trump has called on Congress to eliminate the statutory debt ceiling. While this might avoid debt crises in the short term, it could lead to uncontrolled borrowing in the long run. Then there‚Äôs the wildcard of tax cuts. If Elon‚Äôs ideas include reducing taxes without corresponding spending cuts, deficits could explode. Trump‚Äôs first term added nearly $8 trillion to the debt, partly because of tax breaks. If D.O.G.E follows a similar playbook, the debt problem would spiral out of control. Markets are on edge As we‚Äôve reported in the past, financial markets aren‚Äôt immune to D.O.G.E‚Äôs grand plans. Investors are watching nervously, and for good reason. Analysts say Elon‚Äôs cuts could create a ‚Äúdeflationary shock.‚Äù Bond yields are already rising, making borrowing more expensive for businesses and the government alike. Yields have jumped from 3.6% in September to 4.46% now. This creates a liquidity crunch. Companies struggling to access cheap capital may cut back on investments, leading to slower economic growth. Stock markets could take a hit as investors shift toward bonds, which are seen as safer in uncertain times. Of course that would also affect the crypto market, especially Bitcoin which remains stubbornly correlated with US equities, and Dogecoin (DOGE) which shares a name with the so-called department. There‚Äôs also the fear of reduced consumer spending. If D.O.G.E‚Äôs cuts target entitlement programs like Social Security, millions of Americans could lose disposable income. That would affect the economy, hurting everything from retail sales to housing markets.",NEGATIVE,DOGE,BTC | BUSINESS | DOGE | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/elon-musks-d-o-g-e-could-crash-the-us-economy/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/38068241.jpeg

Let‚Äôs take a moment to reflect on this year‚Äôs biggest memecoin highs and lows. Some coins delivered huge gains, stuffing stockings with profits, while others crashed and burned, earning lumps of coal. Let‚Äôs take a look at some of the biggest winners and losers in the space ‚Äî no sugar-coating included. Political tokens: Naughty or nice? Jeo Boden , parodying US President Joe Biden, surged 1,548% from $0.06307 to $1.04 before crashing 99.74% to $0.00274. Meanwhile, the Donald Trump inspired MAGA skyrocketed 4,170% from $0.41 to $17.51 but dropped 91.7% to $1.45, following a similar fate. The Parent Trap Iggy Azalea ‚Äòs MOTHER sparkled with a 4,798% climb from $0.004709 to $0.2306, but dropped 79% to $0.04837. Unshaken, Azalea has doubled down on her token‚Äôs future with Motherland, an online casino project that could breathe new life into the MOTHER token in 2025. Not to be outdone, Andrew Tate introduced the pseudo-affiliated DADDY, a memecoin designed to counter MOTHER‚Äôs success and ‚Äúflip it for the patriarchy.‚Äù DADDY surged 487% from $0.04917 to $0.2886 before succumbing to a 76% loss to now sit at $0.0684. A lot of hot air Fartcoin blew onto the scene in late 2024, climbing 3,052% from $0.04067671 to $1.28 and holding steady at $1.25. Similarly, GOAT ( Goatseus Maximus ) paired edgy humor with viral AI marketing , surging 3,002% from $0.04354 to $1.35 before settling at $0.508. It‚Äôs snowing cats and dogs Popcat exploded 14,400% from $0.01413 to $2.05 before settling at $0.7912. Cat in a Dog‚Äôs World (MEW) grew 1,312% from $0.0009121 to $0.01288 but fell 51% to $0.006353. MEW‚Äôs attempt to challenge the dominance of dog-themed tokens injected some friendly rivalry into the memecoin ecosystem. Bonk, Solana‚Äôs first dog-themed coin, climbed a mere 210% from $0.0000188 to $0.00005825. In comparison, Dogwifhat (WIF) outperformed , rising 2,292% from $0.201808 to $4.83 before settling 56% lower at $2.12. Viral hits and legal misses ChillGuy, based on the ‚ÄúJust a Chill Guy‚Äù meme, soared 10,789% from $0.00604 to $0.6575 but dropped 71% to $0.1898. Artist Phillip Banks condemned the token, pursuing legal action over its use. PNUT, launched after the viral euthanization of Peanut the Squirrel, surged 7,554% from $0.03187 to $2.44 but fell 71% to $0.6981. The token‚Äôs trajectory was mired in controversy, as Peanut‚Äôs owner condemned its creation and sought to shut it down. Moodeng, inspired by a viral Thai baby hippo , rose 4,300% from $0.01545 to $0.6804 but has since dropped 62% to $0.2576. For every coin that soared, there were 10 that crashed, proving again and again that memecoins giveth and memecoins taketh away.

38067417,https://crypto.news/?p=14322037,1735075059,BTC crosses the hallmark of 19.8 mined units on Xmas eve. It‚Äôs time to talk about Bitcoin‚Äôs supply cap,"On Dec. 24, 2024, the amount of mined bitcoins crossed the 19,800,000 mark, leaving less than 1.2 million bitcoins remaining until the total supply is exhausted. After the 2024 halving, approximately 450 bitcoins are mined each day. According to one of the earliest websites collecting various Bitcoin data, Clark Moody , December 24 saw achieving a 19.8 million mined bitcoins milestone. As many of you might know, Bitcoin has a supply cap of 21 million units. Does it mean that all the bitcoins will be mined soon, and what happens when the remaining supply is exhausted? Why does the Bitcoin scarcity matter, and can the supply cap be removed? These and other questions are answered below. Table of Contents When will all 21 million bitcoins be mined, and what will happen next? Why does the Bitcoin scarcity matter? Is it possible to remove the supply cap? Why will the actual number of bitcoins in circulation never be close to 21 million? What are virgin bitcoins, and why would someone want to pay extra for them? When will all 21 million bitcoins be mined, and what will happen next? While nearly 20 of 21 million bitcoins were mined within the first 14 years of Bitcoin‚Äôs existence, the last remaining fractions of Bitcoin will be exhausted only in 2140. The reason is that the Bitcoin emission is set to drop by 50% roughly once every four years every time another 210,000 blocks are mined. The drop in BTC emissions is referred to as ‚Äúhalving.‚Äù As of December 2024, each mined block unlocks 3.25 BTC as a mining reward. In 2140, this amount will drop below the smallest fraction of Bitcoin, known as Satoshi, a one-millionth particle of Bitcoin. As Satoshi is set to be a minimal fraction of Bitcoin, the 2140 halving will effectively stop the emission of bitcoins. Read more: What will future Bitcoin halvings look like? Mining is at the heart of the Bitcoin network‚Äôs validity and safety, while mining rewards are the prime incentive for miners to continue their troublesome operations. Happily, when the emission of new bitcoins stops, miners will still receive rewards. Instead of getting freshly minted coins, they will receive portions of the transaction fees charged from the senders. It‚Äôs worth saying that fees paid by senders for transaction prioritization already make up a substantial portion of miner rewards. Why does the Bitcoin scarcity matter? While inflation is not inherently bad , as it drives the economy when healthy, Bitcoin is usually celebrated as a deflationary asset. While the government can print more dollars, thus decreasing the value of dollars you already hold, Bitcoin is coded in a way that its supply is immutable and limited to 21 million units. As the overall amount of bitcoins will only go down with time as more and more units will ‚Äòstuck‚Äô in the shut wallets forever, it is believed that the value of each unit will only keep on rising. You might also like: Why is Donald Trump calling on the government not to sell Bitcoin? The stock-to-flow model proponents claim that scarcity drives value. However, it‚Äôs understood that scarcity is far from being the only or the main value driver. Can you draw a single unit of your own currency and expect it to be the most valued one due to extreme scarcity? Probably not. Given that Bitcoin is already enjoying a high value, its scarcity forces buyers to bid for each unit more. That‚Äôs the way halvings drive the BTC price up all the time. Is it possible to remove the supply cap? A three-minute educational video on Bitcoin, released by BlackRock in December 2024, stirred an online discussion over the possibility and implications of the supply hard cap removal. The removal is not impossible, as the Bitcoin network‚Äôs structure has already been edited on various occasions through hard forking. So, if the community working on the Bitcoin improvements votes for making Bitcoin inflationary and makes necessary changes to the Bitcoin architecture‚Äìvoil√†‚Äìsomeday we can see inflationary Bitcoin. The opponents of this move claim such changes would have turned Bitcoin into something completely different. More than that, they remind us that those who don‚Äôt want Bitcoin without a fixed supply can still use the classic version of Satoshi Nakamoto‚Äôs brainchild. What on earth is with it saying that there's no guarantee that the fixed supply will be changed? There absolutely is a guarantee. If they change it, Bitcoin hard forks, there will be two bitcoins. The old fixed supply one will still be around, and that's what people will value. ‚Äî Bludex (@0xBludex) December 18, 2024 Why will the actual number of bitcoins in circulation never be close to 21 million? Many believe Satoshi Nakamoto himself holds large loads of BTC mined in the early days, with some naming an amount of 1 million of BTC. However, the bitcoins in Nakamoto‚Äôs identified wallet have not been moving since 2009, and millions of such frozen bitcoins are all over the ledger. According to the same Clark Moody website that we mentioned in the beginning, there are 220.31 ‚Äòprovably‚Äô unspendable coins. This means that over 220 BTC will never be able to be used as they are isolated as unclaimed rewards, null data outputs, or other ways. However, the word ‚Äúprovably‚Äù indicates that there are more ‚Äúlost‚Äù coins. Various sources claim that 3 to nearly 8 million bitcoins are lost forever. According to the CryptoSlate June 2024 article , 7.7 million are either lost or ‚Äúhodled.‚Äù Bitcoins are lost all the time for various reasons: people lose access to their private keys, hardware, and paper wallets get fatally damaged, coins are sent to invalid addresses, etc. It‚Äôs understood that the amount of lost bitcoins will keep on growing, decreasing the level of bitcoins in circulation. What are virgin bitcoins, and why would someone want to pay extra for them? 2140 will see the end of an era of so-called ‚Äúvirgin bitcoins.‚Äù This term stands for bitcoins that have never been in use and, therefore, have a clean transaction history. Virgin bitcoins are already immensely rare. The only way to obtain such Bitcoin is to buy it directly from the miner via a P2P service (as depositing a virgin Bitcoin in exchange would have stained its transaction history). More than that, if the portion of BTC was received while mining in the pool, it automatically cannot be ‚Äúvirgin‚Äù as the mining pool distributes rewards among mining participants, i.e., miners are not receiving these bitcoins firsthand. More than that, as soon as Bitcoin becomes included in an unspent transaction output (UTXO), it loses its virginity status. It happens as soon as the virgin bitcoin is sent in parts. As virgin bitcoins are rare and hard to get, they are sold at higher prices than usual bitcoins. Why would someone want to pay extra to get a Bitcoin with a clean transaction history? The answer is not hard to grasp ‚Äì institutional investors don‚Äôt want to increase risk by buying bitcoins that were involved in criminal transactions. Such bitcoins in the portfolio may potentially cause harm to their wealth. The only way to cut off these risks is to buy virgin bitcoins. A notable crypto writer, Nic Carter, questions the very existence of virgin bitcoins, noting that it‚Äôs nearly impossible to produce them. In his article, he dismisses the importance of clean transaction history, citing the purchase of bitcoins seized by the U.S. government from the Silk Road market by venture capitalist Tim Draper.

Musk the Manipulator (MUSKMANI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKMANI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk the Manipulator can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk the Manipulator could become the next viral memecoin. Musk the Manipulator launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk the Manipulator on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk the Manipulator by entering its contract address ‚Äì DZpfk5LaLrnP6vSFJnLSMAopUuTJGiFk7543rQxh4ids ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKMANI.

38068216,https://thecoinrise.com/avoided-binance-coin-heres-the-viral-layer-1-presale-everyones-raving-about/,1735074951,Avoided Binance Coin? Here‚Äôs the Viral Layer 1 Presale Everyone‚Äôs Raving About,"The cryptocurrency space is heating up, with investors constantly looking for the next big opportunity. Binance Coin (BNB) has long been a top choice for investors, thanks to its ties to the world‚Äôs largest crypto exchange, Binance. However, as more blockchain projects emerge, there are new opportunities for investors to consider. Enter Qubetics ($TICS) ‚Äì a viral Layer 1 blockchain presale that‚Äôs caught the attention of many for its innovative features and explosive potential. While Binance Coin has established itself as one of the Top Cryptos to Buy and Hold for Long Term, Qubetics presents an exciting opportunity that may offer even higher returns. With its presale already raising over $7.7 million and over 374 million tokens sold, Qubetics is positioning itself to be a serious competitor in the Layer 1 blockchain space. But what exactly sets Qubetics apart from Binance Coin, and why might Qubetics be the Top Crypto to Buy and Hold for Long Term ? Let‚Äôs break it down and find out. 1. Qubetics ($TICS): A Layer 1 Blockchain with Limitless Potential Qubetics ($TICS), the viral Layer 1 blockchain presale, is rapidly gaining attention as a new player in the blockchain ecosystem. Unlike Binance Coin, which is tied to a centralised exchange, Qubetics is an entirely decentralised solution built to solve scalability and interoperability problems in the blockchain space. Currently in its 14th presale stage, Qubetics has already raised over $7.7 million, with more than 374 million tokens sold. With its price set at just $0.0377 per token, the presale is offering an incredible opportunity for early investors before the price surges by 10% in the 15th stage. Qubetics has gained traction due to its focus on scalability, decentralisation, and interoperability. The Layer 1 blockchain allows for faster transactions, lower fees, and seamless cross-chain interaction. This is a significant advantage over other blockchains like Binance Coin, which, despite its success, is still largely tied to the Binance ecosystem. Moreover, Qubetics is the world‚Äôs first web3 aggregator , which means it can connect different blockchain networks, creating a unified and interconnected ecosystem. This makes Qubetics ideal for businesses and developers who want to interact with multiple blockchain ecosystems without the need for complex infrastructure. As a result, the project has already attracted considerable interest from both the DeFi and enterprise sectors. In addition to its scalability and interoperability, Qubetics offers a unique advantage through its Real World Asset Tokenisation Marketplace . This allows businesses and individuals to tokenise assets like real estate, commodities, or even art, giving them the ability to trade fractional ownership in these assets. For example, a real estate developer in Singapore could use Qubetics to tokenise a building, allowing investors to buy fractional shares, which would make real estate investments more accessible. Why did Qubetics make it to this list? With its impressive presale success, innovative blockchain solutions, and unique real-world applications like tokenising assets, Qubetics is fast becoming one of the Top Cryptos to Buy and Hold for Long Term. The potential for massive returns as the project continues to grow makes it a standout in the blockchain space. 2. Binance Coin (BNB): The Giant of the Centralised Exchange World Binance Coin (BNB) is no stranger to the crypto world. As the native token of the Binance exchange, it‚Äôs been used for everything from paying transaction fees to participating in token sales on Binance Launchpad. With its established reputation and wide range of use cases within the Binance ecosystem, BNB has long been seen as one of the Top Cryptos to Buy and Hold for Long Term. Currently priced around $438.13, Binance Coin remains one of the top-performing altcoins in the market. Binance Coin has seen a steady increase in value, driven largely by the continued growth of the Binance platform. With the recent expansion of Binance Smart Chain (BSC), which enables developers to create decentralised applications (dApps) and launch tokens, Binance Coin‚Äôs use case has grown beyond just transaction fees. The growing adoption of BSC in the DeFi and NFT sectors has contributed to BNB‚Äôs price growth and widespread recognition. However, Binance Coin does have some downsides. As a centralised exchange-based coin, BNB‚Äôs value is tied closely to the success of Binance itself. While Binance has had significant success, it also faces regulatory pressure in various countries, which could potentially affect the value of BNB in the long term. In addition, Binance Coin is limited to the Binance ecosystem and doesn‚Äôt offer the same flexibility as some of its competitors. Why did Binance Coin make it to this list? Binance Coin is undeniably one of the Top Cryptos to Buy and Hold for Long Term, especially if you believe in the future of Binance‚Äôs exchange and ecosystem. Its strong performance, liquidity, and growing use cases make it a solid choice for investors looking for stability in the centralised exchange space. Qubetics vs. Binance Coin for Long-Term Growth Let‚Äôs break down how an investment of $10,000 in each of these projects could pan out over the short and long term. For Qubetics, the current price per $TICS token is $0.0377. With $10,000, you would be able to purchase approximately 265,238 tokens. Analysts predict that $TICS could reach $0.25 by the end of the presale, which would offer a 564% ROI. That would mean your $10,000 investment could grow to $56,400. If $TICS hits $1 after the presale, your investment would skyrocket to $265,238, which represents a 2,555% ROI. And if $TICS reaches $5 after the presale, your $10,000 could be worth $1.32 million, yielding a 13,176% ROI. The most optimistic analysts predict that after the mainnet launch, $TICS could hit $15, giving you a jaw-dropping 39,729% ROI, making your $10,000 investment worth $3.97 million. Now, let‚Äôs consider Binance Coin. At $438.13 per token, you could purchase about 22.8 BNB with your $10,000 investment. While Binance Coin has shown solid growth over the years, analysts predict a more modest return in the short term. If BNB reaches $500 within the next 12 months, your investment would be worth $11,400, offering a 14% ROI. Over the long term, Binance Coin may grow steadily, but its returns are unlikely to be as explosive as Qubetics‚Äô. Why did Qubetics make it to this list? While Binance Coin offers steady growth and a reliable place in the market, Qubetics represents a new wave of innovation in the blockchain space, offering exponential growth potential. Its presale success and the unique advantages it provides, such as asset tokenisation, make $TICS a Top Crypto to Buy and Hold for Long Term for anyone seeking higher returns in the evolving blockchain landscape. The Final Thoughts Based on our research and analysis, Qubetics ($TICS) offers a more dynamic and high-potential investment opportunity compared to Binance Coin (BNB). While Binance Coin has been a reliable asset for investors looking for stability and exposure to a centralised exchange, Qubetics presents an exciting opportunity for those looking to invest in a blockchain solution that offers scalability, decentralisation, and interoperability. Qubetics‚Äô innovative features, such as its Real World Asset Tokenisation and its position as the world‚Äôs first web3 aggregator, position it as a Top Crypto to Buy and Hold for Long Term. With the Qubetics presale offering incredible returns and a growing community, now is the time to get in on $TICS before the price increases. Don‚Äôt miss out‚Äîinvest in Qubetics today and position yourself for significant growth as the project continues to develop and gain traction.

The attacks have allowed scammers to steal an estimated $500,000. ZachXBT Uncovers Crypto Phishing Campaign: How Scammers Steal Over $500K From X Accounts ZachXBT showed that these incidents , which began on November 26, are part of a larger scheme by an unknown hacker or group. Over 15 breaches have been linked to this operation. The accounts targeted include Kick, Cursor, Alex Blania, The Arena, and Brett. The attacker accessed these accounts by impersonating the X team in a phishing campaign. 2/3 Each of the 15 ATOs were directly connected by mapping out the deployer address for each scam. The attacker bridged back and forth between Solana and Ethereum in an attempt to obfuscate the funding source. pic.twitter.com/DMcuh0KjXK ‚Äî ZachXBT (@zachxbt) December 24, 2024 The phishing emails were designed to look like official communication from X. They claimed to address fake copyright infringement issues, creating a sense of urgency. Victims were tricked into visiting a phishing website where they were prompted to reset their two-factor authentication (2FA) or password. Once credentials were obtained, the attacker used the compromised accounts to promote meme coin scams. Once compromised, the accounts were used to promote fake Solana-based tokens. Each hacked account shared a contract address and urged followers to invest using SOL, tricking unsuspecting victims into transferring funds. Tracing the deployer address associated with the scams has linked each of the 15 account takeovers (ATOs). The attacker attempted to hide their funding sources by bridging funds between Solana and Ethereum. Despite these efforts, investigators connected the activities to a single threat actor. To protect against such attacks, users are advised to avoid reusing email addresses across services. Security experts also recommend using physical security keys for 2FA on critical accounts whenever possible. X Accounts Under Attack: Symbiotic, EigenLayer, and Truth Terminal Fall Victim to Hacks X, formerly known as Twitter, has become a hub for projects and creators, especially after Elon Musk‚Äôs acquisition, which emphasized free speech and creator monetization. However, its growing prominence has also attracted cybercriminals who exploit the platform to spread phishing links and target creators with scams. On December 8, the Cardano Foundation‚Äôs X account was hacked. The attacker promoted a fake ‚ÄúADAsol‚Äù token and falsely claimed the Foundation would stop supporting ADA. The scam generated $500,000 in trading volume before the token‚Äôs value plummeted by 99%. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson confirmed the breach but warned of the increasing threat to social media accounts. This incident is one of many recent hacks targeting X accounts. In October, Symbiotic‚Äôs X account was compromised , and the attacker posted phishing links disguised as airdrop checklists, leading to stolen tokens. EigenLayer, another restaking protocol, faced a similar hack with a fake airdrop campaign . On Oct. 29, Truth Terminal AI founder Andy Ayrey‚Äôs account was hijacked to promote fraudulent meme coins, resulting in $1.5 million in profits for the hacker. In November, rapper Wiz Khalifa‚Äôs X account was used to shill a fake meme coin called WIZ. Blockchain investigator ZachXBT linked this hacker to Ayrey‚Äôs account compromise. These cyberattacks are growing in sophistication, especially on X, which targets its users with urgency-driven scams and phishing schemes.

38067559,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=632999,1735074623,"Solana adds another transaction record on meme activity, Pengu (PENGU) launch","Solana (SOL) had a one-week streak, where almost daily, the L1 chain posted daily transaction records. The Solana network carried more than 72M transactions as of December 24, far surpassing other chains. Solana is one of the few L1 chains with the technology to scale as an L1 network. The chain still subsidizes its validators, while also expanding its outreach. As of December 24, Solana set a new record for daily transactions, with more than 72M transfers. The record arrives at a time when Ethereum has stagnated at around 1.22M daily transactions, as most of the rapid DEX activity has moved to L2 scalable chains. Solana posted a series of transaction records in the past week, extending the trend for the year to date. | Source: Artemis After the new record, SOL remained under $200, awaiting a recovery. SOL traded at $194.35, trying to recover after the latest market drawdown. SOL open interest slowed down toward the end of the year, to about $3B. Solana‚Äôs daily transactions expanded by 300% in 2024 Data from Artemis shows Solana kept up the trend for all of 2024, after starting the year with 24M daily transactions. Solana has gone through growth pains during busy periods, where failed transactions reached up to 70%. In the past few weeks, the chain achieved a 30%-35% failure rate, allowing for more successful swaps. Earlier in 2024, some of the top chains briefly surpassed Solana but failed to reach its sustainable expansion. At the end of 2024, Solana hosts 86%-89% of all major chain bot users, with the rest spread between Ethereum, Base, and BSC. The influence of Solana also pushed away some of the legacy chains from the previous bull cycle, including Avalanche and Polygon. Bot traffic has been one of the key features of Solana, as the speed of DEX trading and meme token activity is too high for human traders. Solana gets support from meme token activity, which has not slowed down. The Pump.fun platform had a brief slowdown in September but then returned with even higher daily volumes. After producing some of the most appealing memes, Solana also got a boost to its DEX activity. Raydium, Jito, and Solana are still in the top 10 fee producers, though they have fallen away from the top 5 spots. The current transaction peak with relatively lower fees suggests a simpler token activity instead of DEX routing or trading. Solana still produces $3.08M in daily fees, with $4.21M for Ethereum. One of the worrying metrics for Solana is that most users carry less than 0.01 SOL, indicating the high number of transactions may carry very small economic value. Solana meme tokens boost the chances of a super cycle Solana‚Äôs top memes are valued at over $10B in market capitalization, taking into account the value of the 15 most active assets. BONK, WIF, and BOME remain key memes with regular inflows of new traders and whale funds. Pump.fun decreased its activity over the last week of December. Despite this, the platform hosts more than 150K daily active wallets, with more than 50K tokens created in the past few days. Meme tokens also require bot activity, including market makers and boosts to appear more active. Part of the peak Solana transactions may be part of that approach to boosting the positions of new memes. Solana remains a highly competitive ecosystem, where risk and growing pains are part of the process. Despite this, the chain remains a staple in Web3 space. In addition to meme tokens, Solana got a boost from Pengu (PENGU) activity. The native token of the Pudgy Penguins collection is attracting attention from both retail and whale buyers . PENGU rose by 20% overnight after a series of previous records, trading at $0.036. The token is picking up activity again, boosting Solana transactions through its decentralized trades on Raydium.

A week later, on Dec. 17, RLUSD officially launched , becoming available on five crypto exchanges: Uphold, MoonPay, Archax, Bitso, and CoinMENA. Its availability has now widened to include prominent names like Peter Thiel-backed Bullish and Singapore-based Independent Reserve. RLUSD Is Now Live On Bullish, Independent Reserve The Ripple USD (RLUSD) stablecoin has officially started trading on institutional crypto exchange Bullish. Beginning today, investors in eligible regions will be able to trade seven markets. These markets include RLUSD/USDC, BTC/RLUSD, XRP/RLUSD, ETH/RLUSD, USD/RLUSD, EUR/RLUSD, and SOL/RLUSD. Pegged 1:1 to the US dollar, RLUSD was earlier launched on the XRPL and Ethereum blockchains and is fully backed by U.S. dollar reserves, government bonds, and cash equivalents. Earlier today, the stablecoin was also listed by the Singapore-headquartered exchange Independent Reserve. This marks the first time RLUSD has been listed on a Singapore-based platform, drawing substantial attention from the crypto market. Ripple is joining a competitive sector of stablecoin providers that include other well-established crypto firms like Tether and Circle. Payments fintech startup PayPal also rolled out its own dollar-pegged stablecoin , PayPal USD (PYUSD). With a market cap of nearly $140 billion, Tether is presently the undisputed stablecoin market leader. RLUSD currently boasts a market cap of $72.4 million, making it the 696th largest crypto by market value, CoinGecko data shows. Is XRP Gearing Up For A Santa Claus Rally? Meanwhile, Ripple‚Äôs XRP was one of the cryptos that suffered big hits after the most recent market pullback. Its price slumped to under $2 only three days after hitting $2.90, its highest level since January 2018. The bulls have been able to recover some ground over the past couple of days, with XRP currently changing hands for $2.33, marking a 7.8% jump on the day. In a Dec. 24 post , popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed that big whales scooped up around 40 million tokens in the past 24 hours. Earlier on Dec. 20, Martinez had noted that whales had stacked up on an additional 80 million coins in the span of three days. The actions of such large investors reduce the circulating supply of XRP, which could trigger an explosive price rally, assuming demand remains constant or skyrockets. Huge whale purchases could also spur excitement among smaller investors, who could also jump on the bandwagon, therefore creating further upward pressure on the price in the near term. If the bulls continue to dominate the price action, XRP will likely continue to rise. A break above the $3 barrier could see the Ripple-linked token aim for $5.",POSITIVE,XRP | PYUSD,BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | XRP | PYUSD,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/xrp-eyes-5-monster-move-as-ripples-stablecoin-goes-live-on-major-exchanges/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png
38066775,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=313959,1735074059,"Two California Men Charged by Feds in Alleged $22,000,000 NFT Investment Scheme","The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) is charging two California men for allegedly masterminding a multimillion-dollar non-fungible token (NFT) investment scam. In a new press release, the DOJ says it‚Äôs charging 23-year-olds Gabriel Hay of Beverly Hills and Gavin Mayo of Thousand Oaks with conspiracy and wire fraud charges after they were accused of pulling multiple crypto rug pull scams involving NFTs. Rug pull scams are when creators of a new asset intentionally inflate its price before selling their stashes, causing the asset to plummet in value and leaving investors holding the bag. According to court documents, between May 2021 and May 2024, the duo promoted several altcoin and NFT projects and allegedly made or caused others to make false statements about the projects, such as when they would launch. One example provided by the DOJ outlines how they allegedly promoted the Vault of Gems NFT project, which they falsely claimed was the ‚Äúfirst NFT project to be pegged to a hard asset.‚Äù However, they abandoned the project after getting millions of dollars of funds from investors. Other projects the duo was involved in include Faceless, Sinful Souls, Clout Coin, Dirty Dogs, Uncovered, MoonPortal, Squiggles, and Roost Coin. To avoid detection, Hay and Mayo would allegedly lie about being behind the projects and instruct others to do the same, according to the press release. As stated by Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Executive Associate Director Katrina W. Berger, ‚ÄúFor three years, Hay and Mayo allegedly lied to their investors in order to defraud them out of millions of dollars. Such technological fraud schemes cost investors millions of dollars every year. Just because such crimes aren‚Äôt violent does not mean they are victimless. HSI will continue to investigate, disrupt, and dismantle such cryptocurrency fraud networks.‚Äù Hay and Mayo are also charged with stalking for allegedly embarking on a harassment campaign against a developer who exposed that they were behind one of the crypto projects. If convicted of all counts, they face prison sentences of up to 25 years.

38067123,https://thecoinrise.com/binance-to-delist-multiple-low-liquidity-trading-pairs-heres-why/,1735074052,"Binance to Delist Multiple Low-Liquidity Trading Pairs, Here‚Äôs Why","Binance, the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency exchange , has recently moved strategically to maintain its status as a top-tier trading platform. The exchange announced its plans to delist multiple trading pairs on December 27, 2024. Binance noted that delisting is necessary to streamline its services and provide better trading opportunities. Binance Streamlines Trading: What it Means For Traders The delisting affects pairs with low trading activity or liquidity, which Binance considers less beneficial to its users. Among the trading pairs to be removed are AACE/BTC, ACM/TRY, BOME/BTC, and DYM/BTC. Others include MTL/TRY, PIXEL/BNB, PIXEL/FDUSD, QKC/BTC, and RAD/BTC. REZ/FDUSD and TUSD/TRY will also be phased out. Despite the removal, Binance assures users that the underlying tokens will still be tradable through alternative pairs available on the platform. However, Binance has advised users leveraging trading bots to take immediate action. Bots associated with these pairs must be disabled before the scheduled delisting to avoid disruptions or potential losses. Additionally, the platform encourages users to familiarize themselves with its delisting guidelines. This will better help traders understand the implications and processes of such changes. This decision stems from Binance‚Äôs regular evaluation of trading pairs to maintain a high-quality trading platform. Pairs with low activity or liquidity tend to be removed to improve the platform‚Äôs market efficiency. The platform sees delisting as essential for better trading opportunities. Binance Boosts Transparency with Enhanced Metrics Binance‚Äôs strategy of delisting is not unique to this event. In 2023, it removed pairs like AAVE/BNB and YFI/BTC due to low liquidity. This approach is shared by other exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken, which also delist underperforming tokens to ensure secure and user-friendly platforms. To boost transparency, Binance is adding two new metrics from CoinMarketCap . These include Unlocked Market Capitalization (UMC) and Unlocked Circulating Supply (UCS). These will help clarify token data and insider allocations. This move aligns with Binance‚Äôs goal to better serve users with clear data and improved functionality. 2024 is A Record-Breaking Year for Binance Despite the challenges of managing a massive platform, Binance continues to grow. In 2024, the exchange added 70 million new users, pushing its global user base to over 240 million. This year, Binance‚Äôs security measures successfully stopped $4.2 billion in potential scams and fraud. This protection helped shield 2.8 million users from financial losses. Binance‚Äôs growth was driven by enhanced compliance efforts, including securing 20 regulatory licenses globally. The exchange also boosted its compliance team by 34% to strengthen its commitment to regulatory standards. This highlights its dedication to creating a safer, more transparent, accessible crypto platform.

LINK Eyes $100 as Dogecoin Faces Challenges The cryptocurrency arena is ever-evolving, and today‚Äôs landscape is rushing with activity. For those pondering which crypto to buy today, three cryptocurrencies present intriguing stories. Dogecoin (DOGE) is at a pivotal moment for a rebound, Chainlink (LINK) is charting a course toward $100, and BlockDAG (BDAG) is grabbing the spotlight with an ambitious $30 forecast. Chainlink technical analysis reveals a trajectory of sustained growth, whereas the Dogecoin price dip is a test of endurance for traders. Meanwhile, BlockDAG‚Äôs latest technological advances, detailed in its newest whitepaper version V3, are setting new benchmarks for scalability and innovation. While BDAG is the newcomer in this group, its trajectory is poised only for the ascent, unlike LINK and DOGE, which are navigating through market retracements. Dogecoin‚Äôs Price Tumbles ‚Äì Is a Rally on the Horizon? The Dogecoin price recently saw a sharp decline, dropping 25% within just 36 hours. Initially trading above $0.41, DOGE fell to $0.26 amid a broad market selloff following the Federal Reserve‚Äôs decision to pause interest rate cuts. Critical support at $0.22 now represents a crucial juncture for the coin. Market analysts from sources like Rose Premium Signals remain optimistic, suggesting that a bounce from $0.22 could propel DOGE to $0.40894, or even as high as $0.65557, which would mark a significant gain. Despite the steep correction, sentiment around Dogecoin‚Äôs potential for recovery remains strong as it trades around $0.31. Chainlink‚Äôs Path to $100: More Than Just Speculation? Chainlink technical analysis suggests that after a significant upsurge in 2024, LINK is undergoing a correction, now stabilizing in the $23‚Äì$25 support zone. Market enthusiasts from AMCrypto are confident, predicting, ‚ÄúFundamentals are solid; $100 LINK is achievable this cycle.‚Äù Recent patterns indicate a bullish long-term outlook, though immediate hurdles near $47 pose challenges. If LINK maintains its support levels during this dip, the target of $100 appears increasingly within reach. The crypto community is keenly observing LINK as its ability to withstand current market stats will be critical to its potential upward journey. BlockDAG‚Äôs Breakthrough Technology‚ÄîPioneering the Future of Cryptocurrency BlockDAG‚Äôs latest whitepaper update reveals a groundbreaking strategy in the blockchain universe, spotlighting its state-of-the-art EVM and WASM compatibility poised for lasting impact. Tailored for both developers and traders, its DAG-based framework promises unmatched scalability and efficiency, crafted for widespread use. Industry analysts predict that BDAG‚Äôs price could hit $30 by 2030, driven by its unique structure and the streamlined creation of memecoins. As memecoins leverage viral appeal for growth, BlockDAG‚Äôs refined development tools place it in a category of its own, facilitating quicker project launches and seamless scaling. This advantage positions BlockDAG to potentially eclipse established names like Chainlink and Dogecoin, which are currently navigating significant market pullbacks. The ongoing BlockDAG crypto presale highlights its ascending momentum, with over $172 million collected and more than 17.5 billion coins distributed. The coin‚Äôs price remains appealing at $0.0234, delivering early supporters a remarkable 2,240% ROI. This impressive performance has attracted both institutional and retail attention, positioning BDAG as a prominent contender in the market. For anyone contemplating which crypto to buy today, BlockDAG offers an unparalleled choice. Its DAG-based technology, coupled with features that cater to developers and support memecoin ventures, places BlockDAG at the cutting edge of innovation and market potential. Spotlight on Today‚Äôs Top Crypto Picks The cryptocurrency market remains a diverse field where fortunes are built and challenged, with Dogecoin, Chainlink, and BlockDAG each presenting distinct prospects for traders. While Dogecoin tackles pivotal recovery challenges and Chainlink‚Äôs technical analysis forecasts a potential rise to $100, BlockDAG emerges as the revolutionary force poised for substantial growth. BlockDAG‚Äôs ambitious $30 price projection underscores its capacity to blend innovation, profitability, and user-friendliness, marking it as a top choice for those eyeing long-term achievements. For those poised to take action, the decision isn‚Äôt just whether BlockDAG is the crypto to buy‚Äîit‚Äôs when to make the move.

PropiChain is the emerging project in question, aiming to revolutionize the $634 trillion real estate industry. For investors, PropiChain‚Äôs native token, PCHAIN, is more interesting after analysts‚Äô price projections of a 33,029% surge by the end of January, positioning it as one of the best altcoins to buy now ahead of 2025 . Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) Fade Amid Crypto Market Maturity Dogecoin (DOGE), trading at $0.3212 today, has declined 5.31% in the past day, 19.63% over the past week, and 17.21% for the month. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu, touted as the ‚ÄúDOGE killer,‚Äù followed a similar trajectory, dropping 5.05% in the last 24 hours, 19.81% over the week, and 10.75% across the month to $0.00002203 today. Yet, the most surprising aspect of the Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) decline is that they came just as Bitcoin (BTC) broke the psychological $100k barrier and showed no signs of slowing down. However, the reason for this phenomenon is easy to deduce after observing the flow of money over the past month. Like this Wall Street investors betting on PropiChain (PCHAIN) to outperform most of the market, institutions, and governments entering the crypto market are focused on utility tokens outside Bitcoin (BTC), leaving little to no room for meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) to shine. Wall Street Veteran Calls PropiChain ‚ÄúBest Presale Project to Invest in Now‚Äù Considering the seismic shift in focus from meme coins to tokens tied to tangible game-changing projects, dumping the likes of Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) for PropiChain is a ‚Äúno-brainer‚Äù, according to this Wall Street Veteran. Many savvy investors seem to already agree after spending over $1.7 million in acquiring PCHAIN altcoins just weeks into the PropiChain presale . Like many, you‚Äôre probably wondering what PropiChain is and why investors are rushing to grab their share of PCHAIN tokens. The reason is that PropiChain is introducing the first full-service real estate business solution combining blockchain, RWA tokenization, smart contract automation, artificial intelligence, and metaverse technologies. This transformative platform is coming to change real estate from an elitist, unaccessible, and inefficient industry to one where participation is democratized, access is globalized for everyone, and business efficiency is supercharged. At the center of its innovation is making real estate trading as simple and seamless as trading stocks on a digital platform. To achieve this, PropiChain (PCHAIN) is tokenizing physical real estate assets on an impenetrable blockchain where they are readily available for trading. This tokenization not only enables instant property transactions but ushers in the age of fractional ownership , where assets can be traded in unlimited fractions without a limit on how little a person can invest. Democratizing participation is one thing, but PropiChain (PCHAIN) is taking access to the next level with a global metaverse marketplace. With access to the global real estate market and features like virtual tours, virtual meetings, and virtual staging, experts say PropiChain is poised to become a leading Web3 real estate trading hub. Yet, to become a true full-service platform, PropiChain is offering asset managers and real estate investors smart contracts and AI tools with advanced automation features like auto leasing, auto-renewals, auto rent collection, auto asset valuations, and auto property trading. Together, they will offer asset managers an unprecedented level of business efficiency and give investors free tools to conquer the real estate investing market. Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) vs. PropiChain (PCHAIN): The Winner Inherent volatility aside, this double-digit decline for both Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) across the past month, despite the Bitcoin (BTC) rally, is a clear indication to investors of the markets‚Äô shift. Either weather the winter with altcoins or pivot to utility altcoins with the potential for substantial growth before the bull cycle ends. For many, there‚Äôs no better altcoin to buy now than PropiChain (PCHAIN), considering the token‚Äôs realistic 33,029% growth projections fueled by its disruptive nature. PropiChain Presale Raises $1.7M in Record Time, Attracting Wall Street Veteran Many today argue that the crypto market hasn‚Äôt ever been this bullish, citing the doubling of crypto millionaires from 2023 to 2024. Yet, savvy investors are too busy seeking out the next best altcoin to buy now for generational wealth in 2025, with some like this Wall Street veteran already pointing to PropiChain (PCHAIN). Understandably, we haven‚Äôt been this close to a successful Web3 real estate solution, and few are willing to miss a chance to acquire PCHAIN at $0.011 , the lowest price it‚Äôll ever be again. Round-two investors are looking beyond the generous 291% profits awaiting them by the final stage, setting their sights instead on a stunning 33,029% run for PCHAIN by the end of January, potentially turning $865 into $286,565! But there‚Äôs bad news for interested investors. Round two is breezing through, and the early presale success plus news of the BlockAudit security audit and CoinMarketCap listing are only drawing in more traffic, meaning most will miss out on PropiChain at its low price today. However, smart investors, especially those who witnessed the Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba (SHIB) boom, are wasting no time claiming their stake in possibly the next millionaire-making altcoin in 2025.

To read full editions, subscribe . As we approach what will undoubtedly be a new era for federal crypto regulation, this state watchdog head has some advice for companies: Start engaging now. ‚ÄúNever surprise your regulator,‚Äù New York Department of Financial Services Superintendent Adrienne Harris said at the Blockchain Association Policy Summit earlier this month. ‚ÄúWe are by nature risk-adverse people,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt like to be surprised, so come in and talk to us proactively.‚Äù Waiting until there is already an enforcement action underway to meet with regulators is a mistake, Harris said. Companies should be having these conversations before they even file applications, she added. The comments come as New York continues to be a leader in state-level regulation. It was the first state to design a ‚ÄúBitLicense‚Äù program in 2014. The policy, which requires businesses conducting digital asset activities to register with the DFS, came into effect the following year. ‚ÄúForeign jurisdictions and Congress have been for the last several years really borrowing from the New York framework as now it‚Äôs the gold standard,‚Äù Harris said. New York‚Äôs BitLicense may have been received poorly by the industry at first (at least 10 companies initially left the state when the regulations were announced), but the regulatory framework shows the DFS is committed to allowing investors to access the markets they want, Harris said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not our job as a regulator to decide what the market wants or doesn‚Äôt want, right? These instruments are here,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúThis technology is here. It‚Äôs our job to protect consumers, protect markets and ensure responsible growth in the industry.‚Äù While President-elect Donald Trump has not commented on whether he would grant more authority to states to oversee the crypto industry, his administration‚Äôs efforts to shrink the size of several federal agencies, including the SEC, could ultimately have that effect.

Kris Marszalek Announces Crypto.com Sports Betting Feature According to the Monday press release , the latest update will allow U.S. customers of the Singapore-based crypto exchange ‚Äúto participate and trade their own prediction on the outcome of sports events‚Äù on the company‚Äôs website and app. ‚ÄúSports Events Trading offers an entirely new platform for U.S. users to engage nationwide at Crypto.com and in the Crypto.com app,‚Äù said Kris Marszalek. ‚ÄúThis unique financial product allows users to trade their prediction on the outcome of a sports event,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a fundamentally new concept for sports, and we‚Äôre thrilled to be the first regulated platform in the U.S. to offer it to our users.‚Äù Crypto.com CEO Meets With Donald Trump News of the crypto company‚Äôs most recent expansion comes less than a week after Marszalek met with President-elect Donald Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate ahead of his inauguration on January 20. Honored to have a seat at the table. pic.twitter.com/KvK0XyEdYZ ‚Äî Kris | Crypto.com (@kris) December 17, 2024 The duo reportedly discussed the potential of generating a federal bitcoin stockpile and creating a crypto-friendly regulatory framework when the former reality television star returns to the Oval Office. Shortly following the meeting, Crypto.com announced that it would drop a lawsuit filed in October against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that accused the government agency of regulatory overreach. The crypto exchange has previously received a Wells notice from the SEC indicating its intent to execute an enforcement action against the Marszalek-run organization; however, it appears that this action may not come to fruition under Trump‚Äôs upcoming term. ‚ÄúWe look forward to working with the new administration to develop and advance clear regulations for the crypto industry so the U.S. can become a global leader in digital assets and innovation,‚Äù a spokesperson for the company told Bloomberg . Trump pledged during his time on the campaign to enact crypto-friendly regulations should he return to the White House. The New York-born businessman has since selected former SEC commissioner and consulting firm head Paul Atkins to replace current SEC chair Gary Gensler. With clients in the crypto sector, Atkins is widely considered a crypto-friendly approach to Gensler‚Äôs regulation-by-enforcement approach to digital assets.

In a new strategy session, Benjamin Cowen tells his 850,000 YouTube subscribers that the extension from the 20-week simple moving average (SMA) is flashing bearishness for Bitcoin. ‚ÄúIf you look at the short-term bubble risk, which is also just the extension from the 20-week moving average, you can kind of see it‚Äôs in that range where you can find some of these corrections where Bitcoin comes back down to earth.‚Äù Source: Benjamin Cowen/YouTube The analyst says that a correction could send Bitcoin back to the bull market support band, which is formed by the 20-week SMA and the 21-week exponential moving average (EMA). The band currently covers the range between $72,000 and $80,000. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a chance that you see Bitcoin fall all the way back to the bull market support band. But remember last time it kind of just consolidated and waited for the 20-week SMA to catch up. So that‚Äôs also an outcome.‚Äù Source: Benjamin Cowen/YouTube Cowen also suggests that a Bitcoin correction may be more severe than many are anticipating, potentially retesting a trendline that would send BTC down to the $60,000 range. ‚ÄúI do want to also put one potential outcome on your radar just in case it happens, and that‚Äôs basically backtesting this trendline again. We‚Äôve seen that pattern happen a lot with alt/Bitcoin pairs and other random valuations where you‚Äôll see sort of a breakout and then a back test, and then it continues. There is always a chance that something like that happens‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs actually what happened last cycle. You basically had sort of a lower high structure. You eventually had a breakout, followed by a major drop down‚Ä¶ You can kind of see something similar happening back over here [in 2022-2023], there were a couple of lower highs that Bitcoin had and then broke out, was up here for a while, backtested it and then moved up‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs a chance that you see something like that happen, where Bitcoin, maybe it even spends more time up here and maybe even sets a new all-time high, but it could always backtest this trendline, eventually.‚Äù Source: Benjamin Cowen/YouTube Bitcoin is trading for $98,610 at time of writing, up 5.8% in the last 24 hours.

Bernie Moreno On Senate Banking Committee, John Thune Press Release Shows According to Thune‚Äôs press release , Moreno is slated to serve on the Senate Banking Committee, the Senate Budget Committee, the Senate Commerce Committee, and the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. Other key U.S. lawmakers set to serve alongside Moreno on the Senate Banking Committee include bitcoin-friendly Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), crypto-friendly Senator Bill Hagerty (R-TN), and pro-crypto Senator Dave McCormick (R-PA). With the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) overseeing the Senate Banking Committee, Moreno‚Äôs addition may increase the committee‚Äôs overall crypto-friendliness. Moreno, who will begin his term on January 3, defeated Democratic incumbent Sherrod Brown earlier this year by 200,000 votes.

38066420,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/major-altcoins-drop-30-50-will-altcoin-season-even-happen,1735073433,Major Altcoins Drop 30-50%: Will Altcoin Season Even Happen?,"DogWifHat ($WIF) has experienced a 30% drop, Shiba Inu ($SHIB) has decreased by 40%, and Pepe ($PEPE) has fallen by 35%. These substantial corrections have led investors to question the likelihood of an impending altcoin season. Amidst this downturn, Altura ($ALU) stands out as a potential leader in the next altcoin rally. While the broader market faces challenges, $ALU is exhibiting bullish tendencies, forming a falling wedge pattern that often precedes significant price breakouts. Let‚Äôs delve into the current market analyses for these altcoins and explore why $ALU might defy the prevailing trend. DogWifHat ($WIF) Rebounds from Key Support DogWifHat ($WIF) has just been bouncing back after plunging to crucial support at around $2.00. Analysts point out this support has historically provided a key area for $WIF, and the bounce is indicative of a possible bottom for the token. The next major resistance for $WIF is at $2.15. If the price is able to break above this level, we could see some more upside; however, if the DogWifHat fails to hold above the $2.00 region, we could see a retest of the $1.80 range. (These levels are closely being watched by traders for the next directional move.) Shiba Inu ($SHIB) Faces $3.2 Million Market Outflows The market was greeted by a 40% drop on Shiba Inu ($SHIB) during huge outflows. Demand of $3.2 million in SHIB has moved out of the system, and the stream of outflows suggests a downturn in whale involvement. This is a sign of declining investor interest and lower on-chain activity. But the increasing adoption of Shibarium offers hope for a reversal. Important support for $SHIB is located at $0.000022, while resistance is found at $0.00003. Similarly, a resurgence in whale activity and increased utility from Shibariumcould enable $SHIB to reap bullish momentum again. Pepe ($PEPE) Price Rebounds: Is the Crash Over? Pepe ($PEPE), after experiencing a steep 35% decline, has shown signs of recovery. The token is currently stabilizing near support at $0.000017, which has historically been a critical level for PEPE‚Äôs price action.Key resistance levels for $PEPE are at $0.000028 and $0.00003. Momentum indicators suggest a potential upward move if bullish sentiment continues, but a failure to maintain current support levels could lead to further declines. Altura ($ALU): A Bright Spot in a Bearish Market While many altcoins are struggling, Altura ($ALU) stands out as a potential leader in a future altcoin rally. Unlike $WIF, $SHIB, and $PEPE, $ALU is showing resilience. It is currently forming a falling wedge pattern, a historically bullish technical indicator.Falling wedges often precede explosive price movements, and $ALU is no exception. With strong fundamentals supporting its ecosystem and a growing community, $ALU is well-positioned to break out to new highs. The potential for a breakout gives investors a reason to watch this project closely as other altcoins falter. Will Altcoin Season Happen? Yes, altcoin season is likely on the horizon. Experts are very bullish about the prospects for Q1 and Q2 of 2025, which historically represent a period of strong performance for altcoins. This optimism is driven by a combination of macroeconomic factors, increasing adoption of blockchain technologies, and the cyclical nature of the crypto market.At the forefront of this anticipated bullish wave is Altura ($ALU). With its strong technical setup in a falling wedge pattern and growing fundamentals, $ALU is positioned to lead the charge into the next altcoin season. Analysts expect $ALU to break out to new highs, setting the stage for a broader recovery across the altcoin market.Other major altcoins like DogWifHat ($WIF), Shiba Inu ($SHIB), and Pepe ($PEPE) are also expected to recover as market conditions improve. While these coins are currently testing support levels, the upcoming altcoin season could provide the momentum needed to reclaim their previous highs and potentially surpass them.In summary, altcoin season is not a question of ""if,"" but ""when."" With Altura ($ALU) leading the way and market conditions aligning for a bullish Q1 and Q2 in 2025, now could be the time to prepare for what might be an explosive period for altcoins.

38065675,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=666711,1735072229,"Bitcoin Price Can Recover To $107,000 Again If This Important Level Is Broken","Over the last few weeks, the Bitcoin price has been on a downward trend, experiencing significant declines that have pushed it below its all-time high above $104,000. Despite this price crash, a crypto analyst has predicted that Bitcoin could recover from this slump and potentially reach a new ATH at $107,000. However, for the pioneer cryptocurrency to make this recovery, it would have to break past a crucial Fibonacci level. Why The Bitcoin Price Could Rebound To $107,000 Crypto analyst CobraVanguard released a chart analysis on TradingView, illustrating Bitcoin‚Äôs price movement and potential recovery to $107,000 in the coming days. The analyst‚Äôs price chart showed that Bitcoin was previously in a rising wedge, a technical pattern generally viewed as a bearish signal as it indicates the likelihood of a price decline during an uptrend. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Roadmap To $0.75 ATH: Why The Next Wave Is Bearish And Could Drop To $0.15 True to the pattern, Bitcoin broke below the rising wedge, turning its price significantly bearish and triggering declines. Following this wedge breakout, Bitcoin plummeted from above $100,000 to $94,000 in just a few days. CobraVanguard has noted that the Fibonacci retracement levels at 0.618 and 0.382 are marked on the chart, possibly indicating potential resistance and support zones for Bitcoin. With the price of Bitcoin crashing after breaking the wedge, it is now consolidating close to the 0.382 Fibonacci level between $92,000 and $94,000. Considering Bitcoin‚Äôs current bear trend, the 0.382 Fibonacci level may act as support if its price falls again. On the other hand, CobraVanguard has predicted that if Bitcoin can break above the 0.618 Fibonacci level between $98,000 and $100,000, it could indicate renewed bullish momentum, potentially triggering a price recovery towards a new all-time high of $107,000, marked as the ‚Äútarget‚Äù zone on the chart. Based on the trajectory of the arrow in CobraVanguard‚Äôs chart analysis, it appears that before Bitcoin can hit $107,000, it may face an even steeper decline to $90,000. The trajectory suggests a rebound towards $94,000, followed by a dip to $92,000. From there, Bitcoin is expected to climb to $100,000, experience another major pullback towards $95,000, and then surge to the analyst‚Äôs projected ATH at $107,000. Analyst Predicts More Downside For Bitcoin Prominent crypto analyst Jelle has expressed bearish sentiment on the Bitcoin price outlook towards the end of the year. The analyst compared Bitcoin‚Äôs current price movements with those of the previous cycle, highlighting similarities in fractals and bearish trends. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Flashes Major Buy Signal On The 4-Hour TD Sequential Chart, Where To Enter? Jelle predicts that Bitcoin‚Äôs price could drop below $90,000 this week from its current market value of $94,192. The analyst has based this projected price decline on low liquidity, highlighting that festive holidays like Christmas often trigger less liquidity for digital assets, leading to potential downside risks. Nevertheless, the analyst forecasts that after the short-term retracement, Bitcoin could resume its upward momentum in 2025. Based on his chart, he projects that the cryptocurrency could surge as high as $190,000 in Q2 next year.

US spot ether products turned five months old yesterday. But consistent (and substantial) net inflows only started coming after the election. First, a look at the flows by month: Month Net Flows July 23-31 -$484 million August +$6 million September -$46 million October +$43 million November +$1.1 billion December 1-20 +$1.8 billion To summarize: A flood of net money exited Grayscale‚Äôs higher-priced Ethereum Trust (ETHE) in the first few days after it converted to an ETF. The other funds‚Äô inflows could not fully offset those. Then there were three months of rather flat flows. Industry watchers attributed this in part to the need for more education about ETH ‚Äî an asset with a value prop more difficult to grasp than BTC. Donald Trump‚Äôs election win spurred crypto market euphoria . While bitcoin has hit several new all-time high price levels, ETH hasn‚Äôt . CoinShares research associate Luke Nolan previously told me he‚Äôs eyeing February or March for ETH to hit a new high ‚Äî as long as ether ETF flows remain strong. BTC has gained more institutional attention than ETH because of its easier-to-understand digital gold narrative ($36 billion of net inflows for bitcoin ETFs vs. $2.3 billion for ETH products). Then there‚Äôs the fact that ETH also faces competition from other layer-1s like solana, Nolan added. Several fund groups have proposed ETFs that would hold SOL . ‚ÄúEthereum developers have taken a long-term view as to improving the protocol whilst Solana has very much focused on capturing attention and demand now,‚Äù Nolan said. ‚ÄúThey are both valid approaches that each attend to their own use cases and niches.‚Äù Keeping an eye on crypto ETF flows will help us understand investor sentiment toward each asset ‚Äî whether it be BTC, ETH or others that could soon make their way into an ETF wrapper.

By focusing on community-building and offering tangible benefits, it‚Äôs set to become a favourite among new investors looking for the next big thing in the meme coin space. ANDY: The Underdog Nudge Forward Lastly, we have ANDY, the underdog that‚Äôs slowly but surely gaining traction in the meme coin arena.

Think back to 1973, when investors like Warren Buffett saw an opportunity in chaos, scooping up undervalued assets during one of the biggest crashes in history. Fast forward to today, a similar opportunity is knocking in the crypto market. BTFD Coin‚Äôs presale is offering an incredible 50% discount, dubbed the ‚ÄúBIG50‚Äù festive deal, putting it in the spotlight for smart investors. Alongside, Mog Coin and Neiro are making waves with strategic developments and price surges. Let‚Äôs dive into why these three are the best new meme coins to invest in this weekend. BTFD Coin: The Festive Dip That‚Äôs Turning Heads Picture this: The crypto market‚Äôs buzzing and BTFD Coin has just dropped its beta P2E game. No rewards yet, but the gameplay is electrifying, teasing what‚Äôs to come. Meanwhile, the presale, already in its 12th stage, offers a whopping 50% festive bonus with the code BIG50 , rolling back prices to Stage 7. This discount lets investors snag $BTFD for $0.000064, a steal compared to the listing price of $0.0006. With over $4.44 million raised and 58 billion tokens sold to more than 6,500 holders, BTFD‚Äôs momentum is undeniable. Built on Ethereum, BTFD combines security and scalability with an engaging ecosystem. Its staking rewards are already live, boasting an average of 90% APY. For those eyeing long-term growth, staking 1,000 tokens today could yield thousands more in just a few years. The Bulls Squad‚Äîthe community‚Äôs core‚Äîbrings vibrant energy, making BTFD more than a token; it‚Äôs a movement. And with its Play-to-Earn game bridging fun and rewards, the future looks bullish. Let‚Äôs crunch some numbers. Imagine investing $7,500 during this rollback. At $0.000064 per token, you‚Äôd get 117 million tokens. When the price hits $0.0006 post-listing, your investment skyrockets to $70,200. That‚Äôs an 837.5% ROI, nearly 9x your money! But don‚Äôt wait too long‚Äîthis festive deal ends January 5, 2025. Want in? It‚Äôs simple. Visit the presale page now, connect your wallet (like MetaMask), enter the code BIG50 , and lock in your discounted tokens. Don‚Äôt miss the 10% referral bonus, which lets top referrers earn more BTFD monthly. The Bulls Squad‚Äôs rallying cry is clear: buy the dip and ride the bull to wealth. Mog Coin: Riding the Coinbase Wave Mog Coin‚Äôs been on fire since its December addition to Coinbase‚Äôs listing roadmap, spiking 20% and nearing a $1 billion market cap. Trading at around $0.00000227, with highs of $0.00000236, Mog‚Äôs accessibility on platforms like Kraken, Bybit, and Bitstamp fuels its upward trajectory. Mog‚Äôs charm lies in its strong community support, reflecting the meme coin market‚Äôs appetite for relatable, fun projects. Despite its meme origins, it‚Äôs proven its ability to attract serious attention. But with meme coins, volatility is part of the game. Mog‚Äôs recent surge is exciting, but whether it sustains its momentum remains to be seen. For risk-tolerant investors, Mog offers an intriguing option. Its Coinbase roadmap listing boosts visibility and trading volume, positioning it as a potential breakout star. Yet, it‚Äôs crucial to approach with a strategic mindset, balancing the thrill of quick gains with the realities of market fluctuations. Neiro: IP Moves and Market Buzz Neiro‚Äôs been making waves, not just for its ~48% weekly price gain but for its groundbreaking intellectual property acquisition. The Own the Doge DAO‚Äôs move to secure Neiro‚Äôs likeness establishes it as an ‚Äúofficial‚Äù meme coin, distinguishing it in a crowded market. Trading at ~$0.04377, with intraday highs of ~$0.04554, Neiro‚Äôs listing on Binance and KuCoin has catalysed its growth. Institutional interest is rising, evidenced by GSR Markets withdrawing 33.73 million Neiro tokens from Bybit. This signals confidence in its potential. However, market indicators like RSI suggest caution, with profit-taking and selling pressure potentially cooling its recent rally. Neiro‚Äôs appeal lies in its blend of community-driven ethos and innovative strategies. Yet, like Mog, it‚Äôs a high-risk, high-reward play. For those ready to ride the wave, it represents a chance to capitalise on market enthusiasm. Conclusion: The Weekend to Invest If there‚Äôs one takeaway from this weekend‚Äôs meme coin buzz, it‚Äôs this: timing is everything. Based on recent trends, BTFD Coin stands out as the top pick, combining a limited-time discount, robust presale performance, and an engaging ecosystem. With the BIG50 deal slashing prices to $0.000064, the opportunity to achieve 837.5% ROI is too good to pass up. Mog Coin‚Äôs Coinbase momentum and Neiro‚Äôs bold IP moves add spice to the mix, offering diverse options for investors. But for those ready to embrace the BTFD mindset and channel their inner Buffett, the chance to buy the dip and ride the bull is now. Join the BTFD presale without wasting any time, lock in the BIG50 discount, and make this weekend your gateway to crypto success.

Will the White House push for something like that? ‚ÄúYeah, I think so,‚Äù Trump answered. But the rest of his answer really showed an understanding of the cryptocurrency sector‚Äôs importance to the global economy in terms of first principles. That may be the influence of tech engineer and government efficiency advisor Elon Musk, who is famous for saying , ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs important to reason from first principles rather than by analogy.‚Äù Trump Tells Jim Cramer‚Äôs About Crypto ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to do something great with crypto,‚Äù Trump told Kramer. ‚ÄúBecause we don‚Äôt want China or anybody else‚Äî others are embracing it and we want to be the head. We want to be the head of AI. We‚Äôre gonna be ahead of AI,‚Äù he added. Then Trump said something that proves he‚Äôs a crypto fundamentalist, not just a headline reader doing what Elon Musk or his son Barron are telling him: ‚ÄúAnd we‚Äôve got to produce a tremendous amount of electricity. And you know that,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs unbelievable when you think that we need more than twice what we already have. But we‚Äôll be able to do it.‚Äù The Future History of The 21st Century Solar panel prices have already fallen on a parabolic trajectory since the 1970s, pacing like Moore‚Äôs Law dictates of computer microchip prices. But electricity could become even more abundant and cheap. Bitcoin is not only new Internet money. It‚Äôs also an industry with immediate incentives to develop cheap, abundant, renewable energy production. Each time the chip race for more efficient Bitcoin miners catches up to the state of the art, the only place left for miners to compete is on electricity costs. They are already poised to race each other for profit against this expense line in their business model. The possibilities of a smart electrical grid metered by blockchain platforms that are more articulately interchangeable with monetary currencies are scintillating . Trump Appointments Bullish for Crypto Before his inauguration on Jan. 20, Trump has already delivered enormous wins for the blockchain cryptocurrency sector. His nominations for Treasury Secretary, SEC Chair, and White House Crypto ‚ÄúCzar‚Äù are very bullish signals for prices on crypto exchange markets. Two have strong ties to cryptocurrency, and one (Trump‚Äôs pick for SEC Chair) is supportive of the industry, according to Mr. Trump.

Pudgy Penguins released its PENGU crypto last week to 7 million eligible wallet addresses. Users have 88 days to claim 23.5% of 88 billion tokens or 20.6 billion coins.

Analyst Assessed,"Renowned cryptocurrency analyst Omkar Godbolev said that there is a ‚Äúbullish regression‚Äù pattern on the price chart of Solana (SOL). In a recent analysis, Godbolev noted that the price of SOL has risen by over 7% this week to $193, rebounding from a key trendline support level. According to the analyst, the trendline in question connects the highs of March and July to the lows of April and August, creating a descending channel that encompasses SOL‚Äôs long-term swings from March to October. Earlier this month, SOL broke out of this channel, confirming its bullish trend. Solana quickly rose above $260 before pulling back to the breakout, creating what technical analysts call a ‚Äúbullish regression pattern.‚Äù Related News: Trader Who Opened a $60 Million Long Position in This Altcoin Lost Big: Talks About His Mistakes For SOL, the rebound from the breakout level reaffirmed support and signaled renewed bullish momentum. If this trend continues, traders who took early profits could re-enter the market, further fueling the upward momentum, he said. While the bullish regression pattern is promising, analysts warn that the pattern‚Äôs success depends on SOL maintaining support at the breakout level. Failure to do so could invalidate the pattern and send prices back into the descending channel. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: What to Expect Next in Solana?

Daddy Pepe (DADDPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 11,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DADDPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Daddy Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Daddy Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Daddy Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Daddy Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Daddy Pepe by entering its contract address ‚Äì 9UFnMabUe7wecdEEzAYPoQPZiuTJ1hTFpNz6qtsiB3FA ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DADDPEPE.

Analysts believe Remittix, a new DeFi project could be the best low-cap crypto to surpass the $1 billion mark. Remittix (RTX) aims to revolutionize the cross-border payment sector worth over $190T, allowing users to send cryptocurrencies across borders with ease. The project is currently in the presale stage and could give early investors returns of over 15x by 2025. Pepe (PEPE) Targets 4x Surge ChandlerBing, an analyst, has noted that the relative strength index of the PEPE coin has deviated from Bitcoin in recent growth and has not been at this level since April 2024. He notes that after this rather large deviation in April, Pepe (PEPE) went on to have an incredible run, rising over 4x. ChandlerBing also pointed to this historical precedent, and it appears that there is a high probability of another large increase in the PEPE price. In another tweet, Ali Martinez noted that TD Sequential has presented a buy signal on the daily Pepe price chart. According to him, a rebound could occur in the next few days. Presently, the value of the Pepe crypto has dropped by 21.2% in the weekly timeframe. The meme coin is currently battling with bears and could fall to lower levels unless bulls intervene. Fortunately, technical analysis shows that bulls are gaining momentum. The Average Directional Index (14) and Hull Moving Average (9) show buy signals which is a bullish sign. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Targets $0.000042 The Shiba Inu coin is among the memecoins that are in the red region right now. Data from CoinMarketCap shows the value of Shiba Inu has dropped by 18.7% on the weekly chart and 21.0% on the monthly time frame. A top expert called Shib Spain notes the Shiba Inu coin price could soar to $0.000042 in the coming weeks. However, the memecoin must maintain the support around the $0.000020 level. Another analyst called CW is also bullish about the memecoin. They predict the value of the Shiba Inu crypto might soar to $0.0000355 in the next few weeks. The relative strength index currently supports this bullish forecast. It has fallen below the midline and has enough room to rise in the next few days. Remittix (RTX) Redefines Cross-border Transactions Remittix is a new DeFi project in the digital finance space that is gaining traction among investors. It is a platform that uses blockchain technology to operate alongside the existing financial systems to enable people and companies to transfer and receive digital currencies. Remittix is making a difference and encouraging the use of cryptocurrency by offering a stable service that allows for direct crypto to fiat-transfers to bank accounts in over 30 currencies. This solution is unique in that it offers the fastest, safest, and least expensive way of attaining a better financial experience. Remittix is not just about the transactions; it is about people and companies all over the world. It is playing a role in creating a world where everyone can obtain financial services. With these features, this project seeks to close the gap between TradeFi and DeFi to enable easy crypto payments for its users. On the other hand, Remittix has its utility coin called RTX which is used in cross-border payment and can be staked to earn an interest. The RTX coin is in the presale phase at the moment and is priced at $0.0156. Some analysts have dubbed it as the best crypto to buy for 10x returns. Is Remittix The Next Best Crypto To Reach $1B Market Cap After Pepe (PEPE) And Shiba Inu (SHIB)? According to the article, RTX could be the next best cryptocurrency to reach a market cap of $1 billion. It is tapping into the global payment industry that could be worth over $250 trillion by 2027. In addition to this, RTX is a huge part of the Remittix ecosystem and has unique utilities that could lead to more adoption and subsequently, price growth.

The Central American country started buying one BTC every day in November 2022, shortly after the crypto exchange FTX imploded.

BTC advocate Max Keiser, who works as the ‚Äúsenior Bitcoin advisor‚Äù to El Salvador President Nayib Bukele, says Bukele is ramping up buys ‚Äúwith an interim goal of acquiring 20,000 more Bitcoin.‚Äù The additional purchases come shortly after El Salvador secured a $1.4 billion loan facility from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The IMF says the facility is expected to ‚Äúcatalyze‚Äù a combined total of $3.5 billion in financing from the World Bank and various other international financial institutions, but the UN financial agency claimed in a press release that El Salvador‚Äôs government agreed to limit its crypto efforts as part of the agreement. ‚ÄúThe potential risks of the Bitcoin project will be diminished significantly in line with Fund policies.

Cardano (ADA) Cardano (ADA) has experienced notable price swings recently. In the past week, its price fell by 20.80%. Over the last month, it decreased by 14.34%. However, looking back six months, ADA‚Äôs price has surged by 122.45%. This long-term growth suggests strong underlying momentum despite short-term declines. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for ADA is at 42.36, indicating that it is nearing oversold territory. The Stochastic oscillator stands at 13.57, which also points toward potential bullish reversal. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) level is -0.0055, showing bearish momentum but hinting at a possible upcoming shift. With the 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages closely aligned at $0.89 and $0.90 respectively, ADA‚Äôs price is consolidating. If ADA‚Äôs price can overcome the nearest resistance level at $1.28, it could target the second resistance at $1.64. Achieving these levels would represent gains of approximately 48% and 78% from the current price range of $0.72-$1.08. Conversely, if the price dips to the nearest support level at $0.56, it would mark a decrease of about 22%. Traders are watching these levels carefully, as they may signal key opportunities in ADA‚Äôs price movement. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin has seen significant shifts in its price recently. Over the past week, it dropped by 24.51%, and the past month shows a decrease of 25.80%. Despite these declines, DOGE holds a substantial 141.95% increase over the last six months. Currently, it trades between $0.24 and $0.40, reflecting a volatile market stance. Technical indicators present a mixed outlook. The Simple Moving Averages for both 10 and 100 days stand at $0.31, indicating a period of consolidation. The Relative Strength Index is at 41.81, suggesting that the coin is nearing oversold territory. A Stochastic value of 17.76 supports this, pointing to potential upward momentum. However, the MACD level is at -0.002010, which could hint at continued bearish trends. Key price levels are in focus for Dogecoin. The nearest resistance is at $0.48. Approaching this point would mark an increase of around 60% from the lower end of its current range. Beyond that, the second resistance level is at $0.63. On the downside, the nearest support level sits at $0.17. Falling below this could lead to the second support at $0.0252, indicating a significant decrease. These levels are crucial as traders watch for DOGE‚Äôs next move. Conclusion While ADA and DOGE remain strong, XYZVerse (XYZ) emerges as the first all-sport memecoin, uniting fans worldwide and aiming for significant growth in the 2024 bull run.

The tweet , accompanied by a commercial produced by the SBI Group, conveys a bold assertion that XRP may surpass Bitcoin in solving some of the problems that Bitcoin was initially designed to address. REMEMBER THIS AWESOME SBI GROUP COMMERCIAL? #XRP WILL TAKEOVER BITCOIN BECAUSE IT WILL END UP SOLVING SOME OF THE ORIGINAL PROBLEMS BITCOIN WAS DESIGNED TO SOLVE!

It portrays two climbers‚Äîone symbolizing Bitcoin and the other XRP‚Äîcompeting in a race to the top of a wall. Bitcoin, depicted as a powerful and muscular climber, appears capable but ultimately loses to XRP, which is represented as a more strategic and composed climber dressed in a suit. The advertisement suggests that while Bitcoin is recognized for its strength and dominance in the cryptocurrency market, XRP‚Äôs efficiency and tailored design enable it to outpace Bitcoin in solving certain challenges. XRP vs. Bitcoin: A Comparison of Capabilities Bitcoin was designed as a decentralized digital currency to enable peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries. However, its limitations have become evident, particularly in transaction speed, scalability, and energy consumption. Transactions on the Bitcoin network can take several minutes, with fees fluctuating based on network congestion. Additionally, Bitcoin‚Äôs reliance on proof-of-work (PoW) consensus demands significant energy resources, contributing to environmental concerns. XRP, on the other hand, was developed to address these issues, particularly in the context of cross-border payments and financial settlement. XRP boasts near-instant transaction speeds and significantly lower fees compared to Bitcoin. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 It utilizes a consensus protocol rather than PoW, making it more energy-efficient and scalable. These attributes align closely with the needs of financial institutions and global payment networks, such as those in Japan, where SBI Group has been actively promoting XRP adoption. The Role of SBI Group in XRP Adoption SBI Group, a Japanese financial services conglomerate, has long been an XRP advocate. The company‚Äôs CEO has frequently emphasized XRP‚Äôs utility in enabling faster and more cost-effective international transactions. The reference in Amelie‚Äôs tweet to ‚Äúevery Japanese bank‚Äù adopting XRP underscores SBI Group‚Äôs efforts to integrate XRP into Japan‚Äôs financial infrastructure. While the claim of full-scale adoption in nine days may be optimistic, it reflects the growing interest in XRP within the banking sector.

The FBI, Japan‚Äôs National Police Agency and the Department of Defense Cyber Crime Center identified the North Korean group known as ‚ÄúTraderTraitor‚Äù as responsible for the theft of 4,502.9 Bitcoin, according to a new press release from the FBI. Investigators say the breach began in March when a hacker posed as a recruiter and sent a malicious GitHub link to an employee of Ginco, a DMM partner company. After the employee copied the link to their personal account, TraderTraitor gained system access and later impersonated the worker to infiltrate DMM‚Äôs communications. The hackers then intercepted and modified a legitimate transaction request from DMM, authorities said. The stolen funds were quickly transferred to wallets controlled by TraderTraitor, which officials have linked to North Korea‚Äôs government. The heist appears to be part of North Korea‚Äôs broader cryptocurrency theft campaign to generate revenue. According to the press release, the international investigation highlights growing concerns about state-sponsored cybercrime targeting digital assets. Law enforcement officials say the case demonstrates the need for enhanced global cooperation against cyber threats. In August, the blockchain security firm PeckShield said wallets associated with the hackers moved roughly 850 BTC worth more than $54 million to six different addresses in a week.

Sui (SUI) Sui is a new kind of blockchain that‚Äôs designed for the future. It‚Äôs built to handle global adoption by being secure, powerful, and able to scale as needed. At its core, Sui uses a unique way of managing data that focuses on objects. This makes it more efficient than many existing blockchains. It also uses the Move programming language, which adds an extra layer of security and addresses common problems found in other blockchain systems. What makes Sui stand out is its focus on the user experience. Many people find blockchain technology hard to use, but Sui aims to change that. It introduces innovations like zkLogin, which makes logging in easier, sponsored transactions that reduce costs for users, and programmable transaction blocks that make apps more flexible. These features make blockchain applications more accessible and user-friendly. In today‚Äôs market, where usability and scalability are crucial, Sui appears to be an attractive option. Compared to other coins that may struggle with speed or high fees, Sui offers solutions that could make it a strong contender in the crypto space. Dogwifhat (WIF) Dogwifhat (WIF) is the latest sensation in the crypto world, bringing a fun twist to digital currencies. Inspired by the viral Dogwifhat meme, this dog-themed coin is gaining popularity on the Solana blockchain. Meme coins like WIF are known for their community spirit and ability to spread like wildfire across the internet. They often draw from popular memes or cultural trends, making them relatable and exciting for many crypto enthusiasts. In the current market cycle, WIF stands out with its playful approach and growing community. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, WIF focuses on creating a sense of fun and belonging among its holders. While its value can be more unpredictable due to its nature and large supply, many are drawn to its potential for rapid growth and the lively community behind it. Compared to other meme coins, WIF offers a fresh experience on the Solana blockchain, which is known for its fast transactions and low fees. With the rising interest in meme coins, WIF could be an attractive option for those looking to explore new trends in the crypto space. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) started as a joke, much like Dogecoin. But it‚Äôs quickly becoming more than just a meme. Launched in August 2020 by someone known only as Ryoshi, SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain. This means it can work with many apps and systems already using Ethereum. What‚Äôs interesting is that Ryoshi sent half of all SHIB tokens to Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum. This move built trust. Buterin then donated a big chunk to help with COVID-19 relief in India and ‚Äúburned‚Äù 40% of the tokens, reducing supply and raising SHIB‚Äôs profile. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB‚Äôs connection with Ethereum allows for more possibilities. There‚Äôs ShibaSwap, a place to trade tokens without a central authority. Plans are also in the works for a platform for NFTs (digital art) and a system where SHIB holders can have a say in decisions. This could make SHIB more useful. In the current market, while many coins are struggling, SHIB‚Äôs developments could make it stand out. Its potential for real-world use, not just as a joke, might attract more attention. As the crypto world evolves, SHIB could be a coin to watch. Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) There‚Äôs a new squirrel in town, and it‚Äôs turning heads in the crypto world. Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) is a meme-inspired token on the Solana blockchain. Designed for meme lovers and crypto enthusiasts, PNUT brings fun and community spirit to the table. With a total supply of 100 million tokens, it features zero transaction taxes, a revoked contract, and a burnt liquidity pool. This means holders can feel secure about their assets. The token‚Äôs mascot, Pnut, is a playful, Pepe-like squirrel that embodies the project‚Äôs lighthearted vibe. To get your hands on PNUT, you can use platforms like Jupiter Aggregator. In a market where meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have made headlines, PNUT aims to carve out its own niche. Its foundation on Solana offers fast transactions and low fees, which is a big plus. The zero transaction tax and security features make it stand out from many other tokens. With the crypto market always looking for the next big thing, PNUT could be an attractive option for those seeking something new and fun. Its community-driven approach might just be the peanut butter to your crypto jelly. Conclusion Although SUI, WIF, SHIB, and PNUT are promising, XYZVerse, the first all-sport memecoin, aims for 20,000% growth, uniting fans and creating a community-driven movement.

38063845,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=632937,1735068908,How OpenAI cemented its place on a rocky road in 2024,"OpenAI had a challenging journey in marking itself as a prominent force in Artificial Intelligence. However, major milestones and other setbacks occurred for the company in 2024. This year, OpenAI went from a nonprofit to a for-profit company. It also had a big funding round. This happened because CEO Sam Altman returned to help save the company, as he had been removed a year before. Nevertheless, OpenAI still has legal issues, such as lawsuits from a co-founder, Elon Musk, and major newspapers. Moreover, several key employees departed, including those who had been with OpenAI since its inception in 2015. According to a report by Business Insider, OpenAI had a challenging rocky year. xAI raises billions to take on OpenAI with Elon Musk Financial Times reported in January that xAI was seeking to raise $6 billion, which had a valuation of $20 billion. Elon Musk founded xAI as a competitor to OpenAI, his co-founded company. He left the board of OpenAI back in 2018. In February, OpenAI was valued at $80 billion In February, the New York Times reported that OpenAI reached an $80 billion valuation, more than triple its previous value. A tender offer allowed workers to sell their shares. Elon Musk sues Sam Altman and OpenAI Musk filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, claiming that the organization had become a profit-focused subsidiary of Microsoft, which went against his original nonprofit mission. In March, Altman and other executives responded in a blog. It shared that Musk wanted to merge OpenAI with Tesla himself to turn it into a for-profit. In June, Musk dropped the lawsuit, but the case resurfaced in the fall. SEC Investigation into Open AI was revealed According to The Wall Street Journal, the SEC was also investigating whether OpenAI had misled investors. According to sources, the former board was the reason behind the investigation. He said that Altman was not ‚Äúconsistently candid in his communications.‚Äù Sam Altman came back to the OpenAI board in March In March, OpenAI‚Äôs board voted to select ‚Äúthe right leaders for OpenAI‚Äù. The decision was ‚Äúunanimously concluded‚Äù in favor of Altman and President Greg Brockman. Three new female members joined Altman back on the board. In May, OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever left In May, chief scientist Sutskever departed. He had previously attempted to oust Altman from the company, which he later regretted. On X, he penned his farewell, predicting that in the years to come, OpenAI would build safe and beneficial AI. OpenAI also removed ChatGPT‚Äôs ‚ÄòSky‚Äô voice Soon after, OpenAI stopped using ChatGPT‚Äôs ‚ÄúSky‚Äù voice after complaints that it sounded like Scarlett Johansson‚Äôs in the ‚ÄúHer‚Äù movie. When OpenAI used a similar voice to Johansson‚Äôs without her consent, she hired lawyers and revealed she was asked to voice ChatGPT but turned it down. Safety criticism for OpenAI increased in the summer The New York Times report in June also noted that employees were worried about OpenAI not doing enough to make sure its AI was safe. In response, a spokesperson for the company told Business Insider about their safety commitments and an ‚Äúanonymous integrity hotline‚Äù for employees to express their worries and concerns. Furthermore, a report by Vox discussed that OpenAI also strictly enforced NDAs on employees who leave and a risk to their equity if they disagree. This further created PR challenges for Altman. Apple announced the Integration of ChatGPT in June In June, Apple said it would release its own ChatGPT version into the software through Siri. This partnership was a way for OpenAI API to iOS users, which has the potential to reach millions of iPhone users. In August, Elon Musk filed a new lawsuit and added Microsoft as a defendant later In August Musk filed another lawsuit , accusing OpenAI leaders of tricking him about the company‚Äôs objectives. Last month, he added Microsoft and Reid Hoffman as defendants in a lawsuit alleging that they conspired to monopolize AI and pay excessive employee salaries. He also named Shivon Zilis, a former board member and the mother of his three children, in the suit. In September, OpenAI Announced the shift towards for-profit OpenAI, originally a nonprofit since 2015, said it would make its company for-profit within two years. It involves giving investors equity and earning government approvals. This plan has faced criticism from figures such as Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk. Murati announced stepping down as CTO The Chief Technology Officer, Mira Murati, announced that she is leaving the company to work on personal projects. She had been involved in trying to oust Altman and had temporarily taken over as CEO before Altman returned. President Gregg Brockman also returned in November after taking a long leave during August. Business Insider reported that at least nine notable employees recently left OpenAI, including co-founders Andrej Karpathy and John Schulman. OpenAI raised $6.6 Billion in October In October, OpenAI raised $6.6 billion, valued at $157 billion, placing it at the same level as Uber and AT&T. Major investors included Soft Bank, Tiger Global, Microsoft, and Nvidia, led by Thrive Capital. OpenAI was also hit with allegations of legal data deletion in a lawsuit According to the lawsuit, ‚ÄúOpenAI‚Äôs engineers erased all of the News Plaintiffs‚Äô programs and search result data‚Äù when it claimed the lawsuit with other newspapers like The New York Times. When asked about these allegations, OpenAI had nothing to say.

Currently trading between $0.72 and $1.08, it‚Äôs slightly below its 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages. Technical indicators like RSI at 44.78 and Stochastic at 47.53 suggest it‚Äôs poised for a rebound.

XRP Poised for Breakout Amid Anticipated Altcoin Season XRP is trading between $1.86 and $2.63, consolidating after a month of impressive growth exceeding 47%. Despite an 11% dip in the past week, its six-month surge of over 355% highlights strong long-term momentum. The RSI is around 41, indicating room for upward movement before hitting overbought levels. Breaking the nearest resistance at $3.06 could propel XRP toward the next target of $3.83. With altcoin season on the horizon and a global crypto bull run expected, XRP may soon surpass these resistance levels, potentially offering significant gains to investors. Conclusion As ADA and XRP struggle to replicate their past successes, DOGEN emerges as a token with significant short-term potential. Designed for those pursuing excellence, DOGEN promises high growth, following in the footsteps of tokens like BONK and WIF. With a focus on building a strong community and offering real benefits, DOGEN stands out in the current bullish market.

Today, December 25, 2024, the sentiment across the cryptocurrency landscape appears to be shifting from a downtrend to an uptrend, as major assets like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and XRP have begun witnessing notable upside momentum. Bullish On-Chain Metrics With this strong positive sentiment, traders‚Äô and long-term holders‚Äô interest in SHIB seems to be rising, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass.

Meanwhile, with the recent sentiment, this outflow seems to be rising, indicating that long-term holders continue to withdraw the asset from their exchanges. Source: Coinglass In the realm of cryptocurrency, ‚Äú outflow ‚Äù refers to the flow of assets from exchanges to wallets, which indicates potential upside momentum and an ideal buying opportunity. However, this meme coin withdrawal from the exchanges and the continuous price consolidation have occurred near a crucial support level of $0.000021 and the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily time frame. Rising Open Interest In addition to all this, today‚Äôs intraday traders‚Äô interest has also soared, as SHIB‚Äôs open interest (OI) has increased by 13% in the past 24 hours.

38063731,https://thecoinrise.com/iota-plots-big-shift-with-new-tokenomics-strategy/,1735068445,IOTA Plots Big Shift With New Tokenomics Strategy,"Earlier today, the world‚Äôs largest crypto exchange, Binance, announced the IOTA Foundation‚Äôs tokenomics overhaul, signaling a new era for the platform. This move could shape the token‚Äôs behavior in the market, offering fresh opportunities for users and investors alike. This move follows the launch of IOTA Rebased, an ambitious upgrade aimed at transforming its blockchain network. IOTA Introduces A Fresh Economic Model For a Sustainable Future IOTA Foundation is shifting to a more sustainable economic model, introducing a mix of inflation, rewards, and transaction fee burns. The most significant change is adding a 6% annual inflation rate, meaning more IOTAs will be distributed over time. It was revealed that validators and delegators can expect to receive 767,000 IOTAs per epoch, creating an incentive for participation. At the same time, IOTA plans to burn a portion of transaction fees geared toward helping reduce inflation. With transaction fees set at just 0.005 IOTAs, IOTA is trying to create a more stable economy while still offering rewards to those involved in the network. To make things even easier for users, IOTA is introducing sponsored transactions. This means developers can cover user transaction fees, encouraging more people to use the platform without worrying about the costs. The platform hopes this move will encourage more developers to build on IOTA, fostering growth and innovation. IOTA See Surge in Activity: A Promising Start Since the announcement, IOTA has seen a noticeable uptick in trading volume, with a 6% increase in just 24 hours. Its price has also surged by 8%, hitting $0.319, signaling positive momentum. At the time of writing, IOTA‚Äôs price is around $0.319, marking an 8% gain in the past day. However, despite this recent boost, IOTA‚Äôs performance still lags behind other crypto assets in the current bull market. It has a relatively modest 12% annual growth. Analysts Weigh In: IOTA‚Äôs Bullish Potential Despite the ongoing challenges, analysts are increasingly optimistic about IOTA‚Äôs future. Poseidon, a well-known crypto analyst, pointed out that IOTA has recently broken out of its bearish weekly structure. He believes the token is well-positioned for a potential pump, particularly as altcoins tend to perform well towards the end of a cycle. He added, ‚ÄúIOTA has the potential to move higher, provided it holds above the mid-range.‚Äù Similarly, Crypto Nova shared a bullish outlook, emphasizing IOTA‚Äôs renewed focus on Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization . This approach could draw new retail investors, especially since established projects like IOTA often gain attention during market upswings.

Find out who will win the holiday season,"Bitcoin slipped 12% from its all-time high of $108,353, erasing gains from the second week of December. As Christmas nears, crypto traders ponder whether the market will see a ‚ÄúSanta Claus‚Äù rally this year. A CoinGecko report states that eight of ten times between 2014 and 2023, crypto markets rallied around the Christmas holidays. Bitcoin‚Äôs recent price decline has quashed hopes of a Santa rally this year, and declining institutional investment inflow has dampened the sentiment further. Table of Contents Will crypto markets see a Santa rally in 2024? Bitcoin Q4 2024 price performance Top 50 altcoin performance Trump effect, South Korea and Asian influence this cycle Key levels to watch over the holidays Will crypto markets see a Santa rally in 2024? A ‚ÄúSanta Claus‚Äù rally refers to price gains in crypto in the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the following year, according to a CoinGecko report. The performance of the crypto market is, therefore, key during the one-week timeframe from December 27, 2024, to January 2, 2025. Bitcoin‚Äôs decline from its all-time high has raised concerns among BTC traders, and hopes of a Santa Claus rally have dimmed this cycle. Between 2014 and 2023, crypto markets rallied post-Christmas. Crypto markets experienced a pullback instead of a rally, three times out of ten in the past decade with a correction as steep as 12.12% pre-Christmas, during the ICO bubble of 2017.

It‚Äôs important to note that the bull runs in 2020, 2017, and 2013 ended with nearly 480%, 215%, and 168% gains in BTC in Q4. Bitcoin‚Äôs performance this quarter has been lackluster, and there is little evidence to support extended gains in the first two trading days of 2025. Institutional interest in BTC is slowing down, reducing capital inflows, and this is evident from net outflows of Bitcoin Spot ETFs. With Bitcoin‚Äôs Q4 performance under the median of 54.80%, it is less likely that the token will retest its all-time high before the end of the year.

Trump nominated Stephen Miran to be Chair of his Council of Economic Advisers. Miran is a known crypto advocate and another pro-crypto appointment made by the incoming President. Previously, Trump appointed pro-crypto candidate Paul Atkins to head the Securities and Exchange Commission and tech investor David Sacks as artificial intelligence and crypto czar. While these appointments are expected to steer crypto towards positive regulation in the U.S., Bitcoin price continues to slide. Data from Statista shows that South Korea is estimated to be the third largest cryptocurrency market in the world and exchanges in Korea account for over 9% of the global trade volume as of 2021. The Korean Won ranks among the top 5 traded currencies against Bitcoin, per the data. South Korea delayed its crypto taxation until 2027 and adopted a pro-crypto approach, paving way for positive developments in Asia and for Bitcoin traders in Korea. Michael Saylor-led MicroStrategy‚Äôs blueprint to hold Bitcoin on its balance sheet has inspired a wave of adoption across Asia. Per an Asia Express report, Chinese selfie app developer Meitu invested in 31,000 ETH and 940 BTC in the spring of 2021. Japanese firm Metaplanet is accumulating BTC through the dips and now holds 1,142 BTC, as of December 19.

But let‚Äôs be honest‚Äînot everyone was lucky enough to jump on the Litecoin train early. If you‚Äôre one of those folks feeling like you missed out, don‚Äôt worry. There‚Äôs a new opportunity knocking at your door. Say hello to Qubetics ($TICS) , a groundbreaking web3 aggregator that‚Äôs shaking up the crypto world. While Litecoin delivered on speed and efficiency, Qubetics is tackling the usability gaps that have long plagued blockchain technology. If you‚Äôre looking for the best crypto presale to buy this week, Qubetics might just be your golden ticket. Qubetics ($TICS): Redefining the Crypto Experience Qubetics isn‚Äôt your run-of-the-mill crypto project. It‚Äôs the world‚Äôs first web3 aggregator, aiming to simplify blockchain interactions for businesses, professionals, and everyday users. If you‚Äôve ever felt overwhelmed juggling multiple wallets or networks, Qubetics is here to save the day. At the core of Qubetics is its Multi-Chain Wallet‚Äîa tool that consolidates assets across multiple blockchains like Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Solana, and more. Managing crypto assets has always been a hassle, but this wallet changes the game. Imagine a freelancer getting paid in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana tokens. Instead of juggling three separate wallets, they use the Qubetics Multi-Chain Wallet to store, convert, and manage everything in one place. Or picture a small business accepting crypto payments. With Qubetics, they can streamline transactions, saving time and avoiding the headache of dealing with multiple platforms. For individuals, the wallet offers a seamless way to send, receive, and stake tokens without hopping between apps. Whether you‚Äôre new to crypto or a seasoned pro, Qubetics is built to make life easier. The Qubetics presale is making waves. In its 14th stage, $TICS tokens are priced at $0.0377, with more than 374 million tokens sold to over 11,700 holders. The project has already raised $7.7 million‚Äîand the excitement is only growing. With prices set to increase by 10% in the 15th stage this weekend, now is the time to jump in. Crypto analysts are calling Qubetics one of the most exciting projects of 2024. With its real-world utility and user-focused features, $TICS is expected to see explosive growth post-launch. Predictions of a 10x increase are already circulating, making it a prime contender for the best crypto presale to buy this week. Litecoin (LTC): The Classic Crypto With Staying Power Litecoin, often dubbed the ‚Äúsilver to Bitcoin‚Äôs gold,‚Äù has been a cornerstone of the crypto space for years. Created by Charlie Lee, it was designed to be a faster, more efficient alternative to Bitcoin. And for many, it delivered exactly that. Litecoin‚Äôs major strength lies in its speed. Transactions are confirmed much faster than Bitcoin, making it a popular choice for day-to-day transactions. Its lower fees and innovative features like Segregated Witness (SegWit) and atomic swaps have also made it a standout option for those looking for efficiency. Beyond technical features, Litecoin has maintained a reputation for reliability. It‚Äôs like the trusty workhorse of the crypto world‚Äîsolid, dependable, and always in the conversation. While Litecoin has held its ground, the crypto landscape has evolved dramatically. Newer blockchains offering greater scalability, speed, and utility have stolen much of the limelight. Projects like Solana and Avalanche have pushed the boundaries, while presales like Qubetics offer the kind of innovation that gets people excited. Litecoin remains a strong option for those who value stability and a proven track record. However, it doesn‚Äôt offer the same buzz or breakout potential as newer projects. For investors chasing transformative gains, projects like Qubetics are where the action is. Why Qubetics Is the Best Crypto Presale to Buy This Week So, why should you choose Qubetics over Litecoin or any other project? The answer lies in its innovation and accessibility. While Litecoin brought speed and lower fees, Qubetics is tackling the bigger picture. Its Multi-Chain Wallet isn‚Äôt just a tool‚Äîit‚Äôs a solution to one of blockchain‚Äôs most pressing problems: usability. The presale numbers back this up. With $7.7 million raised and over 374 million tokens sold, Qubetics is attracting a growing community of investors who see its potential. And with the price of $TICS set to increase in the next stage, the time to act is now. This isn‚Äôt just a presale; it‚Äôs a movement toward a more inclusive, user-friendly blockchain ecosystem. Conclusion Missed out on Litecoin‚Äôs early days? No worries. Qubetics is here to give you a second chance at something big. With its groundbreaking Multi-Chain Wallet, impressive presale stats, and a mission to simplify blockchain for everyone, $TICS is the best crypto presale to buy this week . Whether you‚Äôre a business owner, an investor, or just curious about crypto, Qubetics has something for you. But don‚Äôt wait too long. With the 15th presale stage looming and prices set to rise, this opportunity won‚Äôt last forever. Head to the Qubetics website, grab your tokens, and get ready to ride the next big wave in crypto innovation.

JustLend was one of the busiest smart contracts, drawing in 55% of all value locked on the TRON network. TRON (TRX) increased its lending exposure in 2024, following the expansion of DeFi on all chains. JustLend was one of the growing apps for the past 12 months, ending up with 55% of the total value locked on the chain. TRON locks in a total of $7.36B in its decentralized protocols, including lending and DEX. The chain still hosts more than $60B in stablecoins, which also partially flow into lending. Based on DeFi Llama data, JustLend holds $5.89B in value locked. CryptoQuant reports $6.17B in lending protocols and a higher total TVL for TRON, due to a different methodology in accounting for apps. JustLend‚Äôs own reporting accounts for $8.3B in total value locked. The protocol offers varied annualized earnings for all locked assets. JustLend reports more than 469K active wallets, although user counts may be lower. While JustLend reports significant value locked, DappRadar only registers 94 daily active wallets, a small fraction of the total reported users. JustLend is the seventh most-visited app on TRON, with $3.25M in daily volumes. TRON‚Äôs lending app managed to perform well based on existing metrics, competing with DeFi versions from the Ethereum ecosystem. The liquidity on TRON is still separate from all other chains. Lending may find another boost in 2025, as the chain will carry its own version of WBTC, potentially serving as valuable collateral. JustLend inflows increased in Q4 With those results, JustLend is building up its share of TVL compared to Aave (AAVE), which already holds more than $20B spread into loans and collaterals. Lending on TRON surpassed bridge deposits and centralized trading activity, rising in the past two months of the year. JustLend boosted the expansion of DeFi lending on TRON in 2024. | Source: CryptoQuant JustLend offers a similar model to other lending protocols, where traders can use their assets as collateral, instead of outright selling. To avoid volatility and liquidations, JustLend DAO is itself a liquidity provider. Demand for JustLend also increased as a tool for passive income. JustLend has its own collection of wrapped tokens, including a version of jUSDT. However, the token is not denominated in dollars but carries a price of $0.01. The asset has just 2,776 holders, similar to other tokens with a few thousand depositors. JustLend also has large-scale whales staking TRX or other assets, helping the app build up its value. More than 10K wallets hold jTRX, the locked token for the lending protocol. TRON marked a year of price records It took years for TRX to break its record from 2017, achieved soon after its ICO. TRX started the year at around $0.10, peaking at $0.40 in early December. As the year comes to a close, TRX corrected toward $0.26, still posting significant net gains. TRX trading slowed down, with open interest sinking to $166M from a peak close to $350M. The network aims to regain its major use cases and reputation, by turning TRX into a deflationary asset. The chain destroys 1.5% of the TRX supply in a year, adding to the token‚Äôs growth trend this year. TRON broke above $2B in fees generated for the year to date. Despite catching up with Ethereum, TRON is still in second place based on total earnings. Ethereum is still ahead with $2.45B in the year to date, based on TokenTerminal data .

Musk the Manipulator (MUSKMANI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKMANI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk the Manipulator can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk the Manipulator could become the next viral memecoin. Musk the Manipulator launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk the Manipulator on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk the Manipulator by entering its contract address ‚Äì DZpfk5LaLrnP6vSFJnLSMAopUuTJGiFk7543rQxh4ids ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKMANI.

Groups including the Bank Policy Institute, the Ohio Bankers League, the Ohio Chamber of Commerce, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Bank Association (ABA) have filed a joint lawsuit with the U.S. District Court in Columbus, Ohio. The suit alleges that the Fed‚Äôs system for testing how big banks would handle a potential economic crisis doesn‚Äôt follow proper administrative procedure. On Monday, the Fed released a press release saying it was considering how to increase the transparency of bank stress tests and reduce the volatility of its capital requirements. While the banking lobby believes that‚Äôs a ‚Äúpositive step,‚Äù they say that litigation is still needed to preserve their legal rights given an upcoming statute of limitations deadline. The suit says that the Fed‚Äôs stress test systems were ‚Äúadopted in secret‚Äù and contain ‚Äúvacillating and unexplained requirements and restrictions on bank capital.‚Äù The goal of the suit is to ensure that bank capital requirements are established in a transparent manner with public input and in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act and the Due Process Clause, beginning in 2026. In a statement posted to its website, ABA president and CEO Rob Nichols says the Fed‚Äôs stress tests are ‚Äúopaque‚Äù in nature, undermining their ‚Äúvalue for providing meaningful insights into bank resilience.‚Äù Nichols says the ABA is pushing for more transparency behind the tests to create a fairer regulatory environment. ‚ÄúWhile we support stress testing as an important risk management tool, ABA has long advocated for the Federal Reserve to increase the transparency of its stress testing program, which shields key components like supervisory models from public view.‚Äù Don't Miss a Beat ‚Äì Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

38062402,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=666747,1735066830,XRP Whales Keep Buying ‚Äì Data Reveals Smart Money Prepares For A Rally,"XRP has been range-bound in recent days, consolidating after successfully holding strong above the critical $2.10 support level. As one of the standout performers this cycle, XRP experienced a massive surge following the US election, capturing investor attention. However, recent price action has introduced uncertainty, leaving some investors concerned about the possibility of further downside. Related Reading: Solana Holds Weekly Support At $180 ‚Äì Analyst Expects $330 Mid-Term Despite these fears, on-chain data suggests a different narrative. Insights from Santiment reveal that whales have accumulated another 40 million XRP in the past 24 hours. This significant accumulation indicates that Smart Money may be positioning itself for an upcoming rally. Historically, such whale activity has preceded major price movements, providing a bullish signal for long-term holders. XRP‚Äôs ability to maintain the $2.10 support level amid market fluctuations demonstrates resilience, but the next decisive move will depend on whether bulls can capitalize on this accumulation phase. If buying momentum continues and XRP breaks out of its current range, a push toward new highs could follow. XRP Continues To Signal Strength XRP continues to display resilience, trading above key support levels and attracting investors who recognize its long-term potential. Despite a significant 30% retrace from recent highs, XRP has held its ground, maintaining critical support zones that bolster a bullish outlook. This stability is driving confidence among market participants, with many seeing the altcoin as a top contender for future growth. Top analyst Ali Martinez recently highlighted compelling data from Santiment, showing that whales added another 40 million XRP to their holdings in the last 24 hours. This follows a broader trend of consistent whale accumulation, a phenomenon often regarded as an indicator of smart money positioning for a significant market move. Such activity suggests that institutional and high-net-worth investors expect XRP to outperform in the coming months. The sustained interest in XRP stems from its ability to remain strong despite recent corrections and broader market uncertainty. Holding above key support levels not only reflects technical strength but also underscores investor confidence in its potential for a significant rally. Related Reading: If History Repeats Dogecoin Has Potential For A Parabolic Rally ‚Äì Details As whale accumulation continues and sentiment shifts, XRP is well-positioned to capitalize on positive momentum. A breakout above resistance levels could mark the beginning of a powerful rally, reinforcing its leadership among altcoins in the current cycle. Technical Analysis: Key Levels To Watch XRP is currently trading at $2.22 after successfully testing the 4-hour moving average (MA) and exponential moving average (EMA) around $1.96 a few days ago. This bounce off critical support levels highlights XRP‚Äôs short-term strength, reinforcing its bullish momentum. The MA and EMA are widely regarded as key indicators for assessing the health of an asset, and XRP‚Äôs ability to hold above them signals strong demand at lower levels. Maintaining support above $2.13 in the coming days is essential to sustain this momentum. If XRP continues to trade above this level, it would solidify investor confidence and pave the way for a potential test of the $2.40 resistance mark. Breaking above $2.40 would likely trigger additional buying interest, potentially driving XRP toward new highs as the broader market sentiment improves. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Bought $1 Billion ETH In The Past 96 Hours ‚Äì Details On the flip side, losing the $2.13 support could introduce some short-term weakness, leading to a retest of lower levels near the MA and EMA.

The Solana meme coin also saw an over 20% spike in its daily trading volume, which is currently well over $200 million amidst heavy interest from TradFi investors. However, sidelined investors may be concerned whether it is too late to buy $FARTCOIN now, and holders may be looking for the next new cryptocurrency to rotate profits to. Is It Too Late To Buy Fartcoin Now? As previously stated, the Fartcoin price is up by 62% on Tuesday. It is currently trading at just above $1, with a market capitalization of $1 billion and a trading volume of $280 million. Fartcoin was created from the Terminal of Truth AI agent, the same as the popular Goatseus Maximus token. It rose to fame earlier this month and even received significant interest from TradFi investors, something which other meme coins have failed to achieve. You‚Äôll see tradfi accounts tweet about Bitcoin from time to time, rarely ever any altsBut now we see tradfi accounts blasting out 3 tweets in a row about fartcoin No other coin has had this effect pic.twitter.com/vDDTsqkJOZ ‚Äî HornHairs üåä (@CryptoHornHairs) December 19, 2024 A big part of Fartcoin‚Äôs popularity is the meme coin‚Äôs hilarious name, and the bulls have no problem with it. They consider the slightly vulgar ticker to be a part of the overall charm. The name is also a key reason behind TradFi‚Äôs growing interest in the meme coin. Institutional investors simply can‚Äôt believe that such a thing as Fartcoin could exist and have a higher market capitalization than a large percentage of publicly traded American companies. For instance, Hedgeye reported that Fartcoin‚Äôs market cap was bigger than 38% of such companies when it had a market capitalization of just $560 million. BREAKING: Fartcoin's market cap is now greater than 38% of all American publicly-traded companies. pic.twitter.com/obLQK8LNTe ‚Äî Hedgeye (@Hedgeye) December 12, 2024 The new cryptocurrency was also the butt of many jokes ahead of December‚Äôs FOMC meeting. Many TradFi investors suggested that the Federal Reserve should restart their quantitative tightening if such a token could have a billion-dollar market cap. However, the bulls are quick to point out that Fartcoin is a community-centric meme coin. Even the token‚Äôs developer team exited early and the meme coin was largely promoted by the degens. Such new meme coins typically see tremendous success, as is evident by Fartcoin‚Äôs recent price action. While sidelined investors are concerned about whether it is too late to buy the Solana meme coin, these concerns are largely unsubstantiated, especially considering its daily Relative Strength Index (RSI-14) is hovering at 66, below the ‚Äúoversold‚Äù territory. In fact, meme coins see their RSI surge to 90 before they see any correction in a bull market. Is New Crypto Wall Street Pepe The Next Fartcoin? Fartcoin‚Äôs biggest strength is its community support. Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) is no different. WEPE has been one of the hottest new crypto presale coins of 2024 and has already raised over $35 million in less than a month. For perspective, the meme coin hasn‚Äôt even launched yet and already has a higher valuation than the pre-Binance market caps of gems like First Neiro On Ethereum and Act I: The Prophecy. $35M raised. Frogs are thriving. Energy‚Äôs high. Stay ready, stay focused, stay green. üê∏‚öîÔ∏èüöÄ pic.twitter.com/qdYWgKVn2X ‚Äî Wall Street Pepe (@WEPEToken) December 23, 2024 Wall Street Pepe‚Äôs utilities are also about the community. In fact, its core mission is to challenge the dominance of whales in the meme coin sector and give a fair playing field to small-scale investors. In this regard, all WEPE holders will soon be members of an exclusive group and receive cutting-edge market alpha. They may even find the next 100x meme coin in that group, considering members can share their insights with each other as well. WEPE holders are already benefiting from the project‚Äôs presale staking pool, which is currently offering a reward rate of 37%.

Despite having a strong track record, Eugene outlined a series of mistakes that led to this costly misstep, while also noting important lessons learned. Eugene started by taking advantage of Bitcoin‚Äôs rise and made a profit from a long position between $102,000 and $107,000. He then shifted these gains into long positions in the Solana ecosystem, such as 220 SOL, 2.75 WIF, and 0.037 BONK, achieving a favorable risk-reward ratio. Initially confident due to Solana‚Äôs strong performance on lower time frames (LTF), Eugene later increased his SOL position from $20 million to $30 million when the market started to decline. Related News: Data Revealed: This Memecoin Has the Strongest Community Eugene admitted that his usual discipline in cutting losses had broken down. When SOL fell to $215, he resisted exiting the market, thinking $200 was a significant support level. Instead of reducing his exposure, he increased his position to $45 million, increasing the risk in an already volatile market. When SOL fell below the $200 support level, Eugene continued to wait, fearing that closing his large position could trigger a price cascade. Succumbing to ‚Äúdesperation,‚Äù he added leverage between $187 and $193, increasing his position to $60 million and increasing the potential downside impact. Eugene, whose unrealized losses were $7-8 million, decided to close 70% of his position at $193, losing $6.2 million (approximately -10.2%). Eugene explained that the transaction went awry due to an accumulation of errors and a ‚Äúsunk cost mentality.‚Äù *This is not investment advice.

38062360,https://finbold.com/?p=222620,1735066646,2 cryptocurrencies to reach a $1billion market cap in 2025,"As 2024 draws to a close, the cryptocurrency market remains a landscape of sharp volatility, presenting both challenges and opportunities for traders and investors. While widespread selloffs and bearish sentiment dominate the broader narrative, a few standout altcoins are defying the odds, gaining traction with fundamentals, upcoming upgrades, and growing community support. These digital assets are positioning themselves for major market cap milestones as signs of market stabilization emerge. Against this backdrop, Finbold has identified two cryptocurrencies, Horizen ( ZEN ) and Conflux ( CFX ), as top candidates to achieve a $1 billion market cap in 2025. Horizen (ZEN) Horizen is gaining momentum as it positions itself to potentially hit a $1 billion market cap in 2025. Currently valued at $582 million, ZEN has surged 157% in the last week, with trading volume exceeding $320 million in 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. The spike follows Grayscale‚Äôs submission of an 8-K form to the SEC for its Horizen Trust, which privately issued 3.56 million shares linked to 304,034 ZEN tokens worth $4.71 million, signaling increased institutional interest. Horizon price and market cap. Source: CoinMarketCap The surge in price can also be attributed to several factors, including growing market confidence and an influx of investors looking to capitalize on the regulated investment vehicle. Further fueling the bullish outlook, Horizen recently underwent its final halving in December 2024 and plans to transition from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake in 2025, increasing scarcity under its new tokenomics. Amid a broader market recovery, ZEN has emerged as a standout performer. Analysts predict ZEN could reach $50 by March 2025, potentially propelling its market cap to $1 billion as adoption and demand grow. Conflux (CFX) Conflux is gaining traction as it inches closer to a $1 billion market cap, currently valued at $800 million. The token has recorded an 8.31% gain over the past 24 hours, supported by strong trading volumes of $53.67 million. A significant 11.49% rise in open interest, now at $33.88 million, highlights growing investor activity and confidence in CFX‚Äôs future price movements. On Binance , long positions on CFX are dominating, with a long/short ratio exceeding 2:1, signaling bullish sentiment among traders. Conflux price and market cap.

38062608,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=632961,1735066531,"This is how crypto tax rules in the US, UK, and EU could impact 2025 investments","A single mistake in crypto regulations can result in imprisonment or the loss of millions of dollars to legislators. Consequently, investors worldwide need to understand the tax implications of owning, trading, and earning digital assets. Here is how 2025 faces the law. The regulatory space is intricate and constantly changing, with the US, the UK, and the EU each implementing unique tax regulations, rates, and exemptions. Paybis CEO Konstantin Vasilenko advised, ‚ÄúMany individuals who have dabbled in crypto were not initially aware that they would need to account for tax reporting and holdings. However, as tax regimes plan to increase their scrutiny starting in 2025, it‚Äôs crucial to be proactive.‚Äù Crypto tax policies in the US In the US, crypto is categorized as a digital asset. Consecutively, the Internal Revenue Service treats it the same as stocks, bonds, and other capital assets. Source: Blockpit Profits from crypto are taxed at different rates depending on whether they are considered capital gains or income. This is determined by how the crypto was purchased and how long it was held. Crypto tax requirements in the US vary depending on how you use your digital assets. This is because different activities are classified as taxable or non-taxable events. For instance, buying crypto with cash and merely holding it does not result in a tax. Only taxes are paid when selling the crypto, and the earnings are ‚Äúrealized.‚Äù In the case of donating crypto to a qualified charity, one may be eligible for a charitable deduction. Similarly, getting crypto as a gift is often tax-free until it is sold or used in a taxable activity such as staking. In the United States, when crypto is sold for more than it is paid for, it will be subject to capital gains tax. Losses, however, may be deductible. Converting from one crypto to another, such as trading Bitcoin for Ether, is considered a taxable event. This is because it entails selling one asset to get another. Similarly, using crypto to purchase goods or services requires one to pay capital gains tax, as the IRS considers this a sale. Also, crypto activities that generate income are subject to taxation. If your company pays you in crypto, it is considered taxable income in accordance with your tax bracket. Similarly, receiving crypto in exchange for products or services must be declared as income. Mining crypto generates taxable income depending on the fair market value of the coins received. Staking awards are taxed, with liabilities determined by the value of the payments when received. However, in a few instances, some crypto assets have been viewed as securities. This has caused misunderstandings. But, with the new administration, the regulations are expected to be more friendly. The UK regulatory framework in 2025 The UK‚Äôs HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) defines crypto as assets. This distinction implies that any gains or losses from crypto trades are subject to capital gains tax. Capital Gains Tax(CGT) is levied on any crypto disposal. This includes selling, using crypto to purchase products, swapping one crypto for another, and giving digital assets. Tax rates can be large, particularly for high-income earners, reaching up to 24%. But, basic-rate taxpayers pay a 10% tax rate on gains above the exemption threshold. Both basic-rate and higher-rate taxpayers now receive an exemption on the first ¬£3,000 of gains. This attracts more people to engage in the crypto industry. However, if these profits place a taxpayer in the higher-rate band, they will be liable to higher CGT rates. Certain crypto activities are subject to income tax in addition to capital gains. Profits from mining and crypto earned as employment compensation are taxed as income. Still, employers who pay in crypto must account for National Insurance Contributions both for themselves and their employees. Any further gains on crypto received as remuneration are normally liable to CGT. The UK has shown interest in making the nation crypto-friendly enough to compete with the US. This has raised expectations that 2025 will be good for crypto in the nation. Crypto tax policies within the European Union are likely to discourage investments Most European countries treat crypto as property, taxing earnings from sale, exchange, payment, and so forth. However, the nature of these levies differs greatly between countries. In Germany, crypto assets are classified as private money. On the other hand, earnings are tax-free if kept for more than a year. This promotes long-term investment. However, selling within a year results in income tax rates of up to 45%, with a 5.5% solidarity surcharge for incomes over ‚Ç¨10,908. On the contrary, Spain taxes crypto gains as ordinary income. This applies to those with rates ranging from 19% to 28%, regardless of holding term. Strict reporting requirements also apply to crypto trading and holdings. Also, Portugal, previously known for its lax crypto tax policy, has tightened regulations. Current rates range from 14.5% to 53%, with a basic 28% capital gains tax and special allowances for mining operations. Now, the EU is working toward harmonization with the markets in the area of crypto-assets (MiCA) Regulation. Moving forward, the MiCA legislation and the EU‚Äôs travel rule will go into effect in 2025, with an emphasis on anti-money laundering (AML) and countering financial crime. These measures are expected to intensify tax oversight, bringing more crypto activities under scrutiny by local authorities. The crypto industry doesn‚Äôt like hearing this, and it could affect crypto investments in EU nations.

From its December 2024 high of $0.46, Dogecoin has lost more than 30%. CoinGlass data shows that DOGE has lost over 30% of its liquidity. The drop has triggered bearish sentiment, leaving investors concerned about the DeFi coin price trajectory. Technical indicators reveal a ‚ÄúDeath Cross‚Äù on the DOGE/USD chart, signaling potential further losses.

These comments come at a time when there is a debate going on over whether crypto staking should be considered taxable. The creation of new value and the transfer of existing value are two different things. Staking is the former. Interest income is the latter. ‚Äî David ""JoelKatz"" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) December 24, 2024 Staking Rewards And Interest Income Schwartz explained that the creation of new value and the transfer of existing value are two different things. ‚ÄúStaking is the former. Interest income is the latter,‚Äù he highlighted. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt earn staking rewards, you create them. They didn‚Äôt exist before you created them. Someone transferring existing value to you is not analogous,‚Äù he noted as he highlighted the unique nature of staking rewards compared to traditional financial income. How Is Crypto Staking Different From Dividends Previously, an X user had asked how crypto staking is different from getting dividends on stocks. Schartz responded expalining that ‚Äúyou get dividends from stocks, someone else created/earned them and transferred them to you. With crypto staking, you create the property you receive.‚Äù ‚ÄúStaking is creating property, not receiving it from someone else who earned/created it,‚Äù he added. IRS Says Crypto Staking Is Taxable This clarification is especially relevant as regulators and tax authorities continue to determine how to classify and tax various crypto activities. As per the latest Bloomberg report, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) officially said that crypto staking is taxable, stating that tax liabilities arise as soon as staking rewards are received. This ruling came amidst an ongoing lawsuit from a Tennessee couple staking on the Tezos network, who filed a lawsuit against the government regarding the tax clarification for crypto staking and how the IRS views it. According to IRS guidelines released in 2023, block rewards from staking or mining are considered taxable income as soon as they are created, with tax liabilities determined by their market value at the time of creation. Crypto staking allows token holders to participate as validators in a proof-of-stake (PoS) system by locking their tokens in a staking contract. In return, they earn rewards, usually in the form of additional cryptocurrency. Crypto staking enables users to generate passive income without selling their assets.",NEUTRAL,ÏóÜÏùå,BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/ripple-cto-schwartz-david-shares-insights-on-crypto-staking-amid-tax-debate/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

In a letter from the Executive Chairman, the company outlined three major agenda items to be decided during the meeting, which will be conducted virtually. MicroStrategy‚Äôs New Proposals The first proposal seeks to amend the company‚Äôs Second Restated Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized Class A shares from 330 million to 10.33 billion. This would facilitate potential future capital-raising activities. The second involves increasing authorized preferred shares from 5 million to 1.005 billion and offering expanded financing options for strategic initiatives. Lastly, the company aims to amend its 2023 Equity Incentive Plan to grant automatic equity awards to new directors joining the Board, aligning their compensation with MicroStrategy‚Äôs long-term Bitcoin strategy. Since October 2024, the firm has raised over $2 billion through equity and debt instruments to expand its Bitcoin holdings, ramping up its position as a corporate leader in digital asset investment. According to the letter, the proposed amendments would provide the flexibility needed to adapt the company‚Äôs financial strategy to evolving market conditions while ensuring sustained alignment with its long-term goals. While the company highlighted the potential for enhanced shareholder value through these measures, it went on to add that the increased share authorizations would not result in immediate dilution but instead offer a framework for gradual implementation. Aggressive Bitcoin Pile-Up The latest development comes just a day after MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor announced acquiring 5,262 BTC between December 16 and 22. This stash is worth approximately $561 million and brings its total Bitcoin holdings to 444,262 BTC, acquired at an aggregate price of $27.7 billion, with an average cost of $62,257 per BTC.

38060902,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=632934,1735064011,AI becomes F1 teams‚Äô secret weapon for track dominance,"Artificial intelligence is quietly taking over Formula 1 (F1). Not in a flashy, futuristic way, but as a cold, calculated tool completely changing how teams approach the world‚Äôs most intense motorsport. At McLaren‚Äôs headquarters in Woking, England, AI doesn‚Äôt scream for attention, but its influence is undeniable. The 60-year-old racing giant has reportedly made AI the backbone of its operations, fine-tuning everything from race-day strategies to commercial growth. Dan Keyworth, McLaren‚Äôs director of business technology, revealed how the team is using machine learning to sharpen its edge. By simulating probabilities, they‚Äôre training AI models to predict everything, down to the finest details of pit stop efficiency and tire performance. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre an organization that‚Äôs used traditional machine learning for a long time,‚Äù Keyworth said. Now, they‚Äôre taking it to the next level with real-time data analysis and digital twins‚Äî3D digital replicas of their cars‚Äîthat recreate track conditions in frighteningly accurate detail. AI simulations sharpen race-day decisions The competition in Formula 1 isn‚Äôt limited to the track. Off-track, it‚Äôs a battle of brains, servers, and algorithms. McLaren‚Äôs digital twins are just one weapon in their arsenal. These virtual models allow teams to simulate and tweak the performance of their cars based on real-world conditions. It‚Äôs all part of the broader AI strategy, which Keyworth said focuses on three pillars: car performance, daily operations, and fan engagement. During a race, every second counts. McLaren uses generative AI to predict what might happen on the track, from the best time to make a pit stop to the optimal tire choice for shifting conditions. ‚ÄúWhat AI allows us to do is game out actual scenarios and go, ‚ÄòWhat will happen?‚Äô‚Äù Keyworth explained. The models are so precise that the results often border on the ‚Äúalmost scary.‚Äù But McLaren isn‚Äôt alone in this AI arms race. Aston Martin Aramco has its own data-driven playbook. Clare Lansley, the team‚Äôs chief information officer, explained that machine learning helps predict patterns by analyzing vast amounts of data on tires, weather, and track conditions. Their ‚Äúdata lakes‚Äù store enormous volumes of information, which their algorithms crunch to improve decision-making. ‚ÄúThe speed of these developments is really impressive,‚Äù Lansley said. The ultimate goal? Free up engineers to focus on car performance instead of drowning in repetitive tasks. Red Bull Racing has also embraced AI with a vengeance. Guillaume Dezoteux, head of vehicle performance at the Italian team, said the technology trims down the need for hundreds of simulations. AI-powered insights let teams make decisions faster and with precision, shaving off milliseconds that could mean the difference between winning and losing. Connectivity fuels F1‚Äôs AI revolution Formula 1‚Äôs AI transformation would fall apart without one key ingredient: connectivity. It‚Äôs the backbone that holds the sport together. Every race, McLaren reportedly packs up mobile data centers‚Äîmini server rooms‚Äîand flies them around the world. These units process data in real-time, ensuring that engineers at the track and back in Woking can communicate seamlessly. These portable data hubs enable McLaren to process vast amounts of information, from real-time car telemetry to live race strategies. He also uses AI to personalize fan experiences, particularly in emerging markets like the U.S., where the sport is exploding in popularity. By tailoring content to fans‚Äô preferences and delivering it at the right times, McLaren is deepening its connection with its audience. Keyworth said the team is working to make fans ‚Äúfeel more connected‚Äù through targeted, AI-driven engagement. On the business side, AI is helping streamline operations. Keyworth described it as a tool for replacing ‚Äúlaborious‚Äù tasks, not human workers. The goal is to make workflows faster and more efficient, allowing employees to focus on high-value activities rather than mundane administrative work. ‚ÄúYou want to unlock your team to do the things that you hired them for,‚Äù he said.

Donald Saves Crypto (DONALCRY), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONALCRY is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Saves Crypto can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Saves Crypto could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Saves Crypto launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Saves Crypto on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald Saves Crypto by entering its contract address ‚Äì Gyy3ss5Yj2ioZWuz6BNbDPGUGUxhwoCskRuU2cGo9k2Q ‚Äì in the receiving field.

Earlier, a prominent blockchain security researcher, Taylor Monahan, alleged that North Korea-backed cyber actors were operating on the platform. The claims, shared via an X post , triggered a massive outflow of funds from the blockchain‚Äôs native token HYPE and sent shockwaves through the crypto community. HyperLiquid Users Panic Amid $249 Million Withdrawal Recent data from Dune Analytics revealed a staggering $249.1 million in Circle‚Äôs USDC net outflows from HyperLiquid on Monday alone. This was followed by an additional $22.2 million on Tuesday. Users were alarmed when Monahan named 12 blockchain addresses allegedly linked to North Korea‚Äôs Democratic People‚Äôs Republic of Korea (DPRK). According to Monahan, these addresses were active on HyperLiquid, with one traceable as far back as October 2. She voiced her concerns in a series of posts, warning that these actors might be familiarizing themselves with the platform to launch a future attack. Monahan expressed concern that skilled North Korean hackers are well-acquainted with the platform. She reiterated her offer to help HyperLiquid strengthen its defenses. Hype Token Whiplash Amid Uncertainty This substantial outflow came months after the decentralized finance platform set a new standard for airdrops with its HYPE token shortly after its launch. The project distributed 310 million, worth $1.2 billion HYPE tokens to its community. The allegations significantly affected HyperLiquid‚Äôs newly launched native token, Hype. Over the weekend, the token‚Äôs value surged to $34.5, but by Monday, it had sharply dropped to $26. Despite a slight recovery of 5.4%, bringing the price up to $29.63, the token showed signs of volatility. This comes as concerns over the platform‚Äôs security and the allegations grew. This dramatic price fluctuation and user withdrawal came just months after HyperLiquid set a new benchmark for DeFi projects with its airdrop of the HYPE token. The platform distributed a massive 310 million HYPE tokens, worth a staggering $1.2 billion, to its community. This generated excitement and widespread attention. HyperLiquid Pushes Back Against Exploit Claims Despite these reassurances, the platform faces growing pressure as North Korea‚Äôs track record of high-profile crypto hacks looms large. These include the infamous $600 million Ronin sidechain exploit in 2022, underscoring the sophistication of DPRK-backed hacker groups. HyperLiquid quickly responded, denying any breach and assuring users that no funds were compromised. On its discord channel, HyperLiquid emphasized that there has been no DPRK exploit or any exploit on the blockchain. Despite the reassurances, the platform might still face pressure due to North Korea‚Äôs history of major crypto hacks . This includes the $600 million Ronin attack in 2022, which raised further concerns.

To read full editions, subscribe . BOB (‚ÄúBuild on Bitcoin‚Äù), a hybrid layer-2 solution leveraging Bitcoin and Ethereum, has taken a significant step forward by successfully testing its first BitVM-powered Bitcoin bridge prototype. Developed in partnership with Fiamma, the prototype in production will deliver trust-minimized BTC bridging. Doing so marks a milestone in the chain‚Äôs scaling ‚Äî with bitcoin, the asset, at the center. BitVM bridges stand out from existing solutions like wBTC or cbBTC ‚Äî which rely on centralized entities ‚Äî and from semi-trusted models. By contrast, BitVM leverages a fraud-proof system, where BTC deposits and withdrawals are secured so long as one participant acts honestly. ‚ÄúBitcoin security and trust-minimized BTC bridging are the two most important pillars of Bitcoin L2s,‚Äù said Alexei Zamyatin, BOB co-founder and BitVM2 contributor. The bridge prototype is expected to be deployed on BOB‚Äôs testnet in early 2025, followed by a mainnet rollout after audits. Additionally, BOB announced plans to integrate with bitcoin staking service Babylon with an aim to establish itself as a Bitcoin-secured network with Bitcoin finality. Signaling for Bitcoin scaling preferences The open Wiki-style signaling forum on Bitcoin soft fork upgrades reflects the growing need for community consensus on covenants like OP_CAT and OP_CTV. Developers, including Zamyatin, have weighed in on proposals. For instance, Zamyatin has marked OP_CTV as ‚ÄúWeak,‚Äù while signaling ‚ÄúEvaluating‚Äù for OP_CAT, thus indicating areas where more discussion is required. The forum is valuable because it collects rationales in one place, moving discussions away from social media fights, according to Zamyatin. ‚ÄúIt makes it easier to evaluate proposals, summarize pros and cons, and have meaningful discussions,‚Äù he told Blockworks . The signaling process has revealed divided opinions: While OP_CTV has garnered moderate consensus, OP_CAT and others remain contentious. As Zamyatin noted, achieving broad agreement will only grow harder as Bitcoin adoption increases. For BOB and the wider Bitcoin ecosystem, these upgrades could eventually enable more advanced capabilities, including native zk-verifiers ‚Äî a vital step toward scaling Bitcoin securely.

Which countries require you to pay taxes on cryptocurrencies? In the United States, it is simply impossible not to pay taxes ‚Äî the authorities are very strict about this and tax almost everything, including digital assets. Crypto is treated as property, not currency. This means taxpayers must pay capital gains taxes when selling cryptocurrencies.

Crypto taxes in the U.S. | Source: Kraken In the UK , the picture is much the same ‚Äî cryptocurrencies are taxed like other assets. Capital Gains Tax (CGT) applies to income above a tax threshold. If the revenue from cryptocurrency trading exceeds a certain amount, the taxpayer must file a tax return and pay tax. The Australian Tax Office also classifies cryptocurrencies as assets. Investors must pay capital gains tax if they sell their tokens at a profit. However, there is a minor clarification ‚Äî in some cases, cryptocurrencies used to purchase goods and services may be exempt from tax if the transaction amount does not exceed $10,000. Overall, Europe is leading, with Switzerland taking the lead: some residents of that country can not only pay for their purchases with cryptocurrency but also their taxes, the Federal Tax Administration (FTA) explains : ‚ÄúIf the salary or ancillary salary benefits are paid to the employee in the form of payment tokens, these are taxable as income from gainful employment 5 and must be shown on the salary certificate.‚Äù You might also like: Why the U.S. doesn‚Äôt need a tax on mining: Senator Lummis explains Why do some countries not have to pay taxes on cryptocurrencies? Several countries encourage the use of cryptocurrencies due to the absence of mandatory taxation ‚Äî this is how the authorities try to attract investors and create cryptocurrency startups. Portugal became one of the few countries where citizens are exempt from paying taxes on income received from cryptocurrency trading . There are exceptions when cryptocurrency is used in professional activities or business. In Germany , cryptocurrencies held for over a year are not subject to taxation when sold. This creates an incentive for long-term investment in crypto assets. However, the profit will be subject to capital gains tax if the crypto is sold before this period. Malta is actively developing its crypto industry and offers favorable taxation conditions. Cryptocurrencies are only taxed if they are sold or exchanged for fiat currency; otherwise, the tax does not apply. Crypto taxes in EU | Source: Protos However, there are countries where there is no need to pay taxes on cryptocurrencies simply because they are banned. Countries where cryptocurrencies are banned China is one of the most famous countries that ban cryptocurrencies. All cryptocurrency transactions were banned in 2021, and regulators were actively cracking down on mining. This has created significant problems for investors and crypto companies in the country. In Algeria, the use of cryptocurrencies, including trading and mining , is strictly prohibited. The African country does not allow cryptocurrency transactions, including exchange and sale, making it impossible to carry out such transactions in the country. Cryptocurrencies are also banned in several other countries, most of which are in the MENA and Asia regions, such as Morocco, Pakistan, and Indonesia . Why do some countries not pay taxes on cryptocurrency? In addition to the ban and investment attractiveness, some countries do not pay taxes on cryptocurrency for a straightforward reason: the authorities have not yet developed regulations for digital assets. For example, although Japan has recognized Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other cryptocurrencies as a legal means of exchange, many aspects of their regulation are being developed. Although the country has several rules regulating crypto exchanges, there are many gaps in the legislation regarding specific taxation factors. In Nepal, cryptocurrencies are still not clearly regulated, but they are de facto banned. Since the government has not developed legislation to regulate this class of assets, cryptocurrencies remain in a legal void.

Cryptocurrency taxation varies from country to country, leading to different approaches to regulating and taxing these digital assets.

However, according to Chainalysis, cryptocurrency adoption continues to grow globally.

38059825,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=632919,1735062131,Trump doesn‚Äôt need Powell and the Fed‚Äôs approval to launch a Bitcoin strategic reserve,"Last week, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell wanted everyone to know one thing: the Federal Reserve isn‚Äôt touching Bitcoin. Not now, not ever. During a press conference following the Fed‚Äôs monetary policy meeting, Powell made it painfully clear that any plan to stockpile Bitcoin wouldn‚Äôt get his support. The result? The crypto market took an immediate nosedive. Bitcoin‚Äôs price, which had been climbing earlier this week, pulled back hard. The odds of a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve (BSR) dropped from 40% to 34% on Polymarket just hours after Powell spoke. Meanwhile, the entire crypto market lost 7.5% of its value, wiping out billions in the blink of an eye. It‚Äôs no surprise traders panicked. But here‚Äôs the thing, a recent report on Wu Blockchain has pointed out that Trump doesn‚Äôt need the Fed‚Äôs approval to start stacking BTC, as we had initially feared . Trump‚Äôs executive workaround But Trump doesn‚Äôt have to care what Powell says. Why? Because as it turns out, Powell actually can‚Äôt stop him. If Trump wants a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, he doesn‚Äôt need Powell or the Fed. He can go straight to the U.S. Treasury and make it happen with an executive order. Here‚Äôs how it works: The Treasury Department controls something called the Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF). This fund was created to stabilize the U.S. dollar and handle financial crises. It holds assets like gold, U.S. dollars, and Special Drawing Rights (SDRs). What it doesn‚Äôt hold‚Äîyet‚Äîis Bitcoin. Trump could issue an executive order instructing the Treasury to change that. Simple. Unlike most government spending, the ESF doesn‚Äôt require Congress to approve its budget. This gives the President and Treasury Secretary an unusual level of control over how the fund is used. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Treasury leveraged the ESF to bail out markets, and Congress had to scramble afterward to impose restrictions. If Trump taps into this fund to buy Bitcoin , Congress might investigate, but by then, the purchases could already be underway. It‚Äôs a fast and dirty option, but it‚Äôs not bulletproof. Executive orders don‚Äôt last forever. Another President could come along, erase Trump‚Äôs Bitcoin initiative, and move the ESF money back to safer, more traditional investments. Still, as a short-term strategy, it‚Äôs one way to bypass Congress entirely. A legal path through Congress Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis has already proposed legislation for this. Her ‚ÄúU.S. Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Act‚Äù is currently sitting with the Senate Banking Committee. Here‚Äôs the catch: passing a bill in Congress isn‚Äôt easy. Even with Republican majorities, bipartisan support is rare these days. The process could take months, if not years. Both the House and Senate would have to approve the bill before Trump could sign it into law. Why bother with the legislative route? It offers stability. Unlike an executive order, a law can‚Äôt be undone by the next administration with the stroke of a pen. A Congressional mandate would lock Bitcoin into the U.S. financial system as a strategic asset, creating a framework for future reserves. For Trump, it‚Äôs a gamble. The legislative process is slow, and crypto doesn‚Äôt exactly have unanimous support on Capitol Hill . But if successful, it would be the strongest endorsement of Bitcoin as part of America‚Äôs financial future, just the way he‚Äôs been saying he wants it. What about the Fed? Some people might wonder if the Federal Reserve could just start buying Bitcoin itself. Theoretically, yes. The Fed conducts open market operations all the time, buying and selling assets like government bonds to stabilize the economy. But Powell‚Äôs comments suggest this won‚Äôt happen anytime soon. ‚ÄúThe Fed is not the place for Bitcoin,‚Äù Powell said. That‚Äôs a pretty definitive no. Even if the Fed wanted to purchase Bitcoin, it would need a new policy framework and likely some changes to existing laws. Powell has made it clear he‚Äôs not interested in pushing for either. This leaves the Treasury as the only real option for a government-led Bitcoin reserve . And while Powell might not like the idea, he can‚Äôt stop the Treasury from acting independently. The Trump factor Trump appointed Powell as Fed Chair in 2018, but their relationship soured almost immediately. The president spent much of his first term bashing Powell for raising interest rates, even threatening to fire him over and over. Fast-forward to 2024, and nothing has changed. Trump still views Powell as an obstacle, and he very much wants his job. Interestingly, the president‚Äôs family crypto project, World Liberty , wasted no time reacting to Powell‚Äôs speech. On-chain data shows the project started buying altcoins just two minutes after the press conference began. All of them almost immediately saw losses, but we don‚Äôt think Trump is bothered.

42389652,6aa0b7fa-5f22-4856-957f-574f11ff0235,1735062071,"Coinbase CEO, Other Crypto Insiders Billions Richer After Seeking to Steer Elections","This is the third in a series of stories examining the crypto industry's high-stakes 2024 foray into politics and campaigning. The first explored the electoral track record of Fairshake PAC's strategy and the second its intense use of a 2010 Supreme Court stance.  The leaders of the companies responsible for the river of money that flooded U.S. political shores this year have already benefited tremendously from the outcome of last month's election ‚Äî increasing their personal fortunes by billions of dollars, far outpacing the large spending they devoted to crypto-friendly candidates.  Coinbase Inc. (COIN) CEO Brian Armstrong and his company devoted some $74 million to the industry's dominant political action committee, Fairshake, putting Armstrong in a close lead over a few other crypto insiders. That's an especially significant amount of money from a company that booked about $95 million in 2023 profits. But the elections went their way, and the company's value has ballooned by $21 billion since Nov. 4, the day before in-person voting began and the outcome became clear.  In a pre-programmed series of trades starting less than a week after the election, Armstrong sold $100 million worth of his Coinbase shares. Those same shares on the night before the election had been worth about $39 million less. A week after that, he cashed in about $313 million ‚Äî all part of a selling strategy he'd set in motion if the price spiked.  Since then, the co-founder and CEO sold smaller amounts week after week, for a total of about $437 million for stock that was worth $308 million before the victories of President-elect Donald Trump and a slate of congressional lawmakers backed by crypto. In other words, the pro-crypto sentiment surging after the election outcome that Armstrong helped shape earned him an additional $129 million in wealth for the shares he sold.  He still owns more than 10% of the largest U.S. crypto exchange, and the value of about 24 million shares tucked into his trust, according to the latest Securities and Exchange Commission filings, is about $6.4 billion ‚Äî up near $2 billion since Nov. 5.  Armstrong's stock sales were planned less than three months before the U.S. elections, submitted in a formal strategy meant to distance corporate insiders from accusations of gaming the markets. And the sales haven't yet reached the halfway point of the SEC-disclosed intent to offload as many as 3.75 million shares, depending on the stock price meeting ""certain threshold prices specified in the Armstrong Plan.""  He took to social media site X to explain the plan several days before the elections, saying he was diversifying ""to make investments in moonshots"" but would be keeping the ""vast majority"" of his shares. He said he put the price targets so high that he didn't expect that most of it would sell in the next year ""unless we do much better than expected."" COIN's stock is currently trading around $276, up from around $186 on Nov. 4.  A Coinbase spokesperson referred CoinDesk to that post when asked for comment.  His rivals among crypto leaders who devoted similar levels of cash to the elections included Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse and the namesake chiefs of investment firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). Ripple gave $73 million, and a16z put in $70 million, including large amounts held over for the next election cycle in 2026.  Garlinghouse reportedly owns more than 6% of Ripple, the company, and a large but unspecified amount of the token tied to it, XRP. Various reports put him high among the list of U.S. billionaires as a result. In the wake of the election, XRP surged to become the third-largest crypto asset by market cap.  While Garlinghouse chose not to weigh in with details on his net worth, he credited excitement over the return of Trump to the White House in a statement to CoinDesk.  ""The crypto market is up over $1 trillion since Trump won ‚Äî that‚Äôs the price of Gensler‚Äôs foot on the neck of the market, and he‚Äôs not even officially gone yet,"" Garlinghouse said.  Since the election, Garlinghouse's holdings of XRP have multiplied more than three times as the price of the token jumped from $0.50 to $2.32. And though the non-public Ripple Labs valuation is uncertain and was last set in the neighborhood of $11 billion earlier this year, the election has almost certainly boosted the worth of his major stake. Garlinghouse's personal wealth has likely skyrocketed as a result.  The financial status of Mark Andreessen and Ben Horowitz is even murkier, but both men have gained dramatically since last month from their many stakes in crypto companies, likely outpacing the money they devoted to U.S. politics. But the financial figures aren't available for a16z's investments in private companies as they are for public Coinbase.  The firm's vast crypto portfolio includes stakes in Coinbase, Uniswap, Solana, EigenLayer and Anchorage Digital and dozens of others. Virtually all of them became more valuable as the U.S. executive branch will be run by Trump, who says he'll be the crypto president, and the 535-member Congress includes some 300 predicted to be supportive of digital assets ‚Äî including the dozens just supported by Fairshake in their elections.  But a company spokesman declined to comment on CoinDesk's review of the gains for Andreessen and Horowitz as individuals.  A16z's dip into U.S. politics was aimed ""to help advance clear rules of the road that will support American innovation while holding bad actors to account,"" according to a post from the firm's Chris Dixon.   Separately from Fairshake, Andreessen and Horowitz backed Trump's election effort. And Andreessen has become an adviser to the pro-crypto president-elect as he prepares to start his second term next month.   The crypto benefactors from Coinbase, Ripple and a16z combined to make the Fairshake super PAC and its affiliates into the most powerful corporate campaign-finance effort in the 2024 elections, helping 53 members of next year's Congress win their races. However, Fairshake didn't weigh in on the presidential election, which may have had the largest effect on crypto market prices.   Garlinghouse, in a post-election interview on 60 Minutes, said, ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs clear that Donald Trump embraced crypto and crypto embraced Donald Trump."" While he didn't claim credit for Trump's success, Garlinghouse said the crypto PACs ""absolutely helped supercharge the candidates"" and influenced outcomes in congressional contests.  His company pledged $5 million in XRP to Trump's inauguration ‚Äî the celebration next month of his return to the presidency ‚Äî and Coinbase and fellow U.S. crypto exchange Kraken have also raised their hands to fund it.  During the elections, the crypto industry was accused by its critics of being remarkably transactional in its political strategy ‚Äî putting money into the best places to ensure future pro-crypto votes on legislation and buying more than $130 million in congressional campaign ads with framing across the political spectrum (and without mentioning crypto). Gains for the sector have meant a boost for the three main companies behind Fairshake and for their individual leaders, who are tied to them financially.  The sector's political effort went in ""purely on interests of the specific industry,"" said Rick Claypool, the research director at Public Citizen who has examined crypto's campaign spending. ""Short term, obviously this has caused a big bump in crypto.""  The return on investment for industries putting money into politics can ""often be pretty good,"" said Mark Hays, a senior policy analyst at Americans for Financial Reform, who has also worked on campaign finance issues. ""Crypto is newer, and so the opportunity for growth is larger.""  While Armstrong and the others prefer a political narrative that features a grassroots upswell in crypto voters that shifted the elections, he and his company were directly behind establishing Stand With Crypto, the group that's billed as a grassroots effort to harness the will of crypto voters. And Fairshake's political influence was based almost entirely on money from Coinbase and the partner companies, plus smaller amounts from Jump Crypto and Gemini.  Gemini's leaders, Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, were also among Trump's loudest fans in crypto.  The day after the voting, Cameron Winklevoss posted on X: ""Imagine how much we are going to accomplish in the next 4 years now that the crypto industry won't be hemorrhaging $ billions on legal fees fighting the SEC and instead investing this money into building the future of money. Amazing awaits.""  On Nov. 11, the day Armstrong began selling large amounts of Coinbase stock, Tyler Winklevoss posted, ""The shackles are off, 100k incoming.""

Expert Sets Prediction For Breakout Timing,"Analysts and investors alike have Dogecoin under the lens, particularly in light of recent forecasts indicating a possible price spike. Market analyst Javier Santini has made headlines with his forecast that Dogecoin could hit $4 within a week after an ongoing correction phase. Related Reading: Dogecoin (DOGE) Hints at Revival: Can It Defy The Odds? Analyst‚Äôs Take Javier Santini, founder of Elemento Cripto, bases his prediction on how prices have changed since Dogecoin‚Äôs start in 2017. He says that drops below all-time highs are likely to last for a month or more before the coin starts to rise again. Every mid cool-off (below ATH) since the beginning of $DOGE has exactly 1 month of duration at +24th. A fact since 2017. The next and first hyperbolic push will start next week and should reach $4 in a week or less. $XRP to $25. The news should be very unexpected. pic.twitter.com/1Y2HpinqrH ‚Äî Javier Santini (@javierosantini) December 21, 2024 After hitting a high of $0.48 in the wake of the US presidential election results in early December, Dogecoin is currently undergoing a correction. It has since fallen 35%, but according to Santini, this collapse is a normal part of the market cycle. Santini claims that the historical data for Dogecoin demonstrates recurring trends throughout corrections. Based on Dogecoin‚Äôs weekly chart, he provided insights that showed each mid-cool-off period has lasted approximately one month. He believes that Dogecoin will have a huge rally following this correction, which he believes will end soon, and may hit $4 in as little as a week. Compared to its current price of roughly $0.3253, this would indicate an astounding growth of over 1,168%. Market Sentiment And General Patterns Dogecoin excites and worries people. Some investors are wary about cryptocurrencies due to their volatility, but others want to profit. While the correction has garnered attention, analysts like Santini say such swings are normal and often precede major rallies. Other expert @Degengambleh predicts Dogecoin will reach $4.20, supporting Santini‚Äôs optimistic estimate. He foresees another rise since a 1,000-day accumulation pattern shows substantial underlying support for the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Can Ethereum Break $3,500 Before End Of 2024? Analyst Weighs In Multiple Variables Whether Dogecoin actually achieves these lofty goals going forward will depend on numerous variables, including market mood and more general developments within the cryptocurrency space. Very soon, we may yet witness another chapter in this remarkable history of Dogecoin‚Äôs‚Äîa swift rise after a period of consolidation‚Äîif Santini‚Äôs theory is correct.

Data from Web3 security firm Hacken reveal that over $2.3 billion was lost due to hacks across the cryptocurrency sector, with CeFi taking the most losses compared to other categories like DeFi, Gaming/Metaverse, wallet/user, and ‚Äòothers.‚Äô Source: Hacken While losses across DeFi dropped 40% from the previous year, the value almost doubled in CeFi, rising from $339 million in 2023 to $694 million in 2024. The first half of the year saw the most losses for both sectors, but high-profile breaches across the CeFi market gave the sector a noticeable lead. Top two CeFi hacks of the year: DMM Bitcoin Japanese cryptocurrency exchange DMM Bitcoin recorded the most losses in 2024 after exploiters drained roughly $304 million from the platform after its private keys were compromised. WazirX The July hack of Indian cryptocurrency exchange WazirX shook the local market after bad actors drained $230 million worth of user assets from the exchange‚Äôs hot wallet. Hackers managed to gain access to 4 of the 6 signatures required to sign a transaction, allowing them to upgrade the wallet to a malicious contract. DeFi security grew stronger According to Hacken, the DeFi sector benefited from innovations across the multiparty computation (MPC) protocols, zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), and improved bridge security, which significantly reduces vulnerabilities. For instance, MPC allows multiple parties to jointly manage private keys without exposing them, while ZKPs allow blockchain networks to verify transactions without revealing sensitive data. Yet attackers still managed to target several DeFi platforms. Top two DeFi hacks of the year: Radiant Capital Hackers targeted the DeFi protocol in mid-October and used malware to infect the systems of some of the project‚Äôs developers. Subsequently, they intercepted and manipulated transactions to drain approximately $55 million worth of assets from one of its lending pools. Orbit Bridge The cross-chain protocol was targeted in early January by compromising several multi-signature wallet signers. This allowed attackers to bypass security checks and authorize malicious transactions, resulting in the theft of roughly $80 million worth of assets. Private key theft the biggest threat In 2024, private key theft remained the most significant threat to the crypto industry, with major exploits across both DeFi and CeFi stemming from compromised private keys and weak multi-signature wallet setups. As the saying goes, ‚ÄúNot your keys, not your crypto.‚Äù In fact, the percentage of attacks stemming from access control exploits surged compared to the previous year. Roughly 50% of 2023 hacks were due to private key compromises and weak access controls, but the percentage shot up to 75% this year. Private key leaks have consistently led to significant financial losses. According to a report from security firm PeckSheild, it led to $7.2 million in losses in November alone. A similar trend was observed by CertiK, which reported $343.1 million in losses across 65 incidents caused by leaked private keys in Q3 2024.

38061107,https://cryptonews.com/?p=322351,1735061079,Holiday Cheer Snubbed as Bitcoin Price Plummets 15% ‚Äì Is the ‚ÄòSanta Rally‚Äô Dead?,"The Fed‚Äôs revised projections have lowered anticipation for further easing running into 2025, somewhat stifling bullish projections for the Bitcoin price and other risk assets. The ‚ÄòSanta rally‚Äô phenomenon has historically provided significant tailwinds over the festive period, but with a 14.5% Bitcoin price plummet from its December peak, hopes have dwindled. Something evident as trading volume remains at a $55 billion low, a telling sign that traders are less willing to jump on the asset. Is It Too Late for a Santa Rally? While this dismal price performance is worrying, the ‚ÄòSanta Claus Rally‚Äô window extends post-Christmas, during the last five trading days of December through to the first two trading days in January. From 2014 to 2023, crypto markets experienced a Santa Claus rally eight out of 10 times post-Christmas, according to CoinGecko data . During these rallies, the total crypto market cap increased between 0.69% and 11.87% over a one-week timeframe from December 27th to January 2nd. ‚ÄòSanta Clause rallies‚Äô over past years. Source: CoinGecko. The exception was the cycle peak in 2021, when the Bitcoin price had fallen about 26% from its high of $69,000 by Christmas Day and continued to decline throughout 2022. The difference is that 2021 was the cycle‚Äôs peak year, whereas 2025 is expected to be this cycle‚Äôs peak year, following the four-year pattern that has played out since Bitcoin‚Äôs inception. December 27th seems a credible kickoff for a Santa Claus rally, particularly as the market is set for increased volatility with $18 billion worth of Bitcoin and Ether options contracts due to expire. Bitcoin Price Analysis: Is a Bottom In Sight? Technical indicators lend to a potential bottom, with the Breakdown of an ascending channel forming since mid-November. BTC / USDT 1D chart, ascending channel pattern breakdown. Source: Binance. This breakdown eyes a potential bottom at the $87728.44 support level, representing a further 6.85% decline from current levels. While the 50SMA currently offers support, it seems unlikely to be an early bail-out. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 43 and the MACD line‚Äôs hold below the signal line indicate that the bears continue to dominate Bitcoin‚Äôs price action. Therefore, the support at $92,597.58 could be lost, leading to a retracement to lower support levels. However, this could ultimately provide Bitcoin with more stable footing, setting the stage for a potential Santa Rally as the year closes. This New Opportunity Could Be the Better 2025 Play While Bitcoin certainly has high potential running into 2025, its meteoric rise this year has been overshadowed by meme coins ‚Äì the foremost narrative driving gains this cycle.

38058940,https://crypto.news/?p=14322020,1735060973,Pepe Coin price rebounds: Is the crash over?,"Pepe coin price joined other meme coins in a rebound as the Santa Claus rally happened on Christmas Eve. Pepe ( PEPE ), the third-biggest meme coin, surged in a high-volume environment as investors bought the recent dip. This rally happened as Bitcoin ( BTC ) jumped to $98,500, and the crypto fear and greed index approached the greed zone. Most cryptocurrencies rallied, with the market cap of all coins tracked by CoinGecko hitting a high of $3.60 trillion. Pepe had a 24-hour volume of $2.2 billion, while the futures open interest rose for the third consecutive day, reaching a high of $151 million. It has jumped to the highest level since December 30. The coin also jumped as signs showed that Pepe was the cheapest it has been since Nov. 5 in terms of the Market Value to Realized Value indicator. The MVRV-Z score indicator is widely seen as one of the most accurate indicators in predicting tops and bottoms. You might also like: Hedera Hashgraph price soars as predicted: What‚Äôs next for HBAR? This indicator is calculated by considering an asset‚Äôs market price and the realized value. This MVRV value has dropped to 1.28, a sign that it has become highly oversold. The last time that Pepe had this MVRV value was in November, and the coin staged a strong rally to an all-time high of $0.00002830. Pepe MVRV ratio | Source: IntoTheBlock The other contrarian case for Pepe is that there are signs that speculators capitulated and exited their trades. Data shows that the number of active, new, and zero balance addresses dropped by over 20% in the last seven days. As shown below, the active addresses ratio has dropped to 1.34%, its lowest level in over a month. Most Pepe price breakouts happen when the ratio is falling. Pepe active addresses ratio | Source: IntoTheBlock Pepe coin price analysis Pepe chart | source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the Pepe coin price peaked at $0.00002830 earlier this month and then suffered a harsh reversal. It dropped below the important support level at $0.00001713, the upper side of the cup and handle pattern that formed between May and November. A break and retest pattern is usually a sign of a continuation. Pepe remained above the 100-day moving average and is attempting to flip the 50-day MA. So, is the Pepe price crash over? Not yet, since this rebound may be a dead cat bounce. It may also be part of the formation of a bearish flag chart pattern, a popular downward continuation sign. Therefore, there is a risk that the coin will resume the downward trend once the Santa Claus rally ends. A complete bullish breakout will be confirmed when the coin rises above the psychological point at $0.000025. Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

38059018,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=632904,1735060872,Bitcoin‚Äôs surge prove Wall Street‚Äôs crypto converts right,"Bitcoin smashed through the $100,000 mark this month, erasing doubts about the career choices of Wall Street elites who risked everything for crypto. These weren‚Äôt small-time players‚Äîthey were Ivy League graduates and high-powered financiers from companies like Morgan Stanley and BlackRock. They ditched secure, well-paying jobs for the unpredictable world of blockchain. For a while, it looked like they made the wrong call. FTX crumbled, Bitcoin tanked to $16,000, and crypto‚Äôs reputation hit rock bottom. Family, friends, and former colleagues couldn‚Äôt help but say, ‚ÄúTold you so.‚Äù Then came 2024. Bitcoin‚Äôs rally rewrote the narrative. Donald Trump‚Äôs shock election victory in November triggered a price explosion, revitalizing an industry many on the NYSE board had written off. Crypto companies are hiring again, venture capital is flowing into blockchain projects, and the markets are alive. The resurgence has given these risk-takers not only financial relief but also validation. Vivek Raman, a Yale graduate and former Wall Street trader, left behind nearly a decade of stability for crypto during the last bull run. He took a 75% pay cut and joined a blockchain startup. ‚Äú2024 changed it all,‚Äù Raman said. His startup, Etherealize, now focuses on bridging Wall Street and Ethereum ecosystems. He reportedly said he spent years asking himself, ‚ÄúWhy aren‚Äôt we trading bonds on blockchains?‚Äù Now, the industry seems ready to answer that question. The tough road from TradFi to crypto Raman isn‚Äôt alone. Wall Street veterans who moved to crypto have lived through cycles of extreme highs and lows. Patrick Liou, a former BlackRock trader, saw Bitcoin hit $50,000 on his first day in crypto. But by 2022, everything fell apart. Bitcoin crashed, offices emptied, and the stigma around crypto careers became suffocating. Liou admitted there were moments he thought about returning to traditional finance. ‚ÄúBut it takes belief and courage to stick through it,‚Äù he said. Liou now works as a principal at Gemini, one of the few companies to survive the crypto winter intact. The recent rally has turned the tide. A friend thanked him for a 3x return on Bitcoin purchased years ago, while an old mentor called to congratulate him. When Bitcoin hit $100,000, Liou reportedly celebrated at Pubkey, the Bitcoin-themed bar in New York famous for hosting president Donald Trump during his campaign. ‚ÄúI finally convinced my wife to come with me,‚Äù he joked. Zach Pandl, once a senior economist at Goldman Sachs, now leads research at Grayscale Investments. He saw the current Bitcoin rally as more subdued but still transformative. Unlike earlier bull runs, this one is backed by institutional capital from giants like BlackRock and Fidelity. Michael Harvey, who moved to crypto giant Galaxy Digital in 2023 after nearly two decades in finance, recalled the doubts he faced when switching industries. On his first day, a colleague gave him a bottle of Johnnie Walker Blue Label as a joke. It sat unopened on his desk for over a year. But now, with Bitcoin up over 500% from its 2022 lows, Harvey said he‚Äôs finally considering breaking it open. ‚ÄúThis year‚Äôs been good,‚Äù he said, according to the report. Do Bitcoin and Wall Street even go together? Bitcoin and Wall Street make an odd couple, like oil and water‚Äîor maybe like bankers and trust. For years, Wall Street dismissed Bitcoin as some anarchist experiment, too volatile and chaotic for the buttoned-up world of traditional finance. But now? The suits are lining up to get a piece of the action, calling it a ‚Äúhedge‚Äù or an ‚Äúalternative asset class‚Äù while carefully avoiding words like ‚Äúrevolution‚Äù or ‚Äúdecentralization.‚Äù But Wall Street loves a good story, and this one has legs, especially when the Federal Reserve keeps printing money like it‚Äôs going out of style. Adding Bitcoin to portfolios gives institutions something to parade around at investor meetings. ‚ÄúLook, we‚Äôre hip and forward-thinking!‚Äù Meanwhile, Bitcoin‚Äôs meteoric rise‚Äîup over 500% since the depths of 2022‚Äîmeans the returns are hard to ignore, even for the skeptics. But here‚Äôs the thing: Bitcoin and Wall Street still don‚Äôt really mix. Wall Street wants control, stability, and predictability. Bitcoin offers the opposite. Its price swings like a wrecking ball, jumping over $108,000 one Monday and slipping below $92,000 the next. Wall Street might claim to embrace volatility, but when things get messy, they‚Äôre quick to pull the plug. So when Wall Street starts offering Bitcoin ETFs or custody services, they‚Äôre not ‚Äújoining the revolution.‚Äù They‚Äôre just finding ways to skim off the top. The culture clash is real. Bitcoin‚Äôs core ethos is about financial sovereignty, putting power back in the hands of people. Wall Street is about squeezing out profits wherever possible, often at the expense of the people. So, do they go together? Technically, yes. Philosophically? Not a chance.

38061106,https://cryptonews.com/?p=322332,1735060608,Panic Erupts as $112M Leaves Hyperliquid Following North Korean Hacking Concerns,"Reports that the decentralized exchange Hyperliquid could be the next target of North Korean hackers have resulted in massive capital outflows and a significant drop in the value of its recently airdropped token $HYPE. On December 22, the well-known crypto analyst Taylor Monahan provided evidence that wallet addresses tied to the North Korean government were executing transactions on the exchange. Monahan, who also works as a developer for the crypto wallet MetaMask, said that this is part of the classic modus operandi of hackers from the DPRK that consists of interacting with a certain crypto protocol to identify potential flaws that they can exploit. DPRK's trading career is‚Ä¶uh‚Ä¶.going‚Ä¶.. tbh if i was the dude managing Hyperliquid's 4 validators (or those fucking ghetto ass binaries on gh) I would be shitting my pants right now. Hyperliquid dudes dont seem worried at all though so im sure its fine. pic.twitter.com/JrrU7t1sJe ‚Äî Tay (@tayvano_) December 22, 2024 He blasted Hyperliquid for having multiple points of weaknesses that these sophisticated hackers can take advantage of including a small network composed of 4 validators that can easily be corrupted to create false records and drain money from the protocol. ‚ÄúDPRK doesn‚Äôt trade. DPRK tests,‚Äù he argued. Among the evidence provided by Monahan, he claims that North Koreans have already lost around $700,000 in their trades. That kind of commitment shows that they are engaged in a relentless pursuit to identify Hyperliquid‚Äôs flaws. The market picked up on these rumors and reacted quite negatively as indicated by the behavior of the exchange‚Äôs total value locked (TVL). According to data from DeFi Llama, the value of the assets held with the exchange has dropped from a peak of $3.44 billion on December 17 to $2.28 billion as of today. However, it is worth noting that this decline can be partially attributed to the overall weakness that the crypto market has experienced in the past week. That said, data from Dune Analytics confirmed that USDC outflows ‚Äì a stablecoin whose value does not fluctuate ‚Äì totaled $61 million in December 23. In addition, the value of the recently airdropped $HYPE token declined from $35 to $28.3 shortly after Monahan shared his findings. As a result, around $1.2 billion of the token‚Äôs market cap evaporated in just a few days. The $25 level seems to be the most relevant area of support for the token at the moment. Any drop below this level may indicate that investor‚Äôs confidence in the exchange‚Äôs safety continues to erode. Meanwhile, the $35 peak is the most important resistance to watch if Hyperliquid manages to assure the community that they have the situation under control. Hyperliquid Claims That No Vulnerability Has Been Reported Hyperliquid responded to these allegations in its Discord channel stating: ‚ÄúWe are aware of reports circulating regarding activity by supposed DPRK addresses. There has been no DPRK exploit ‚Äì or any exploit for that matter ‚Äì of Hyperliquid. All user funds are accounted for. Hyperliquid Labs takes opsec seriously. No vulnerabilities have been shared by any party.‚Äù North Korean hackers are a serious threat to the crypto industry. Various government-sponsored collectives are known for systematically targeting exchanges, bridges, multi-chain protocols, and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications to steal money that the state can use to fund the development of weapons of mass destruction. A recent report from the BBC noted that North Koreans have reportedly siphoned approximately $1.3 billion via crypto hacks just this year. This means that they doubled their bounties compared to last year. Some high-profile incidents include the loss of $300 million from the Japanese exchange DMM and another $235 million from the Indian crypto exchange WazirX. Although Hyperliquid has confirmed that no protocol vulnerabilities have been reported, investors have been spooked by these rumors either way as evidenced by a 19% drop in the value of $HYPE. This Solana Layer-Two Protocol is Safe and is Attracting Millions in Its Presale A new era could be about to start for the Solana ecosystem with the arrival of Solaxy ‚Äì a layer-two (L2) protocol that aims to guarantee the scalability of this popular network at a point when transaction volumes are climbing fast. Solaxy‚Äôs native token $SOLX is currently in presale and the developing team has managed to raise over $5 million from investors already as the practical utility of this digital asset is hard to overlook. The goal of Solaxy is to decongest the Solana mainnet by bundling transactions offline. This reduces the number of blocks that need to be processed by the Solana blockchain, which results in fewer errors and delays. The $SOLX token is available at a discounted price of $0.001578 for early buyers but this offer expires in less than 48 hours. After this period ends, late buyers will have to pay a higher price to get their hands on the token and will likely miss a portion of the returns. Buying the token is easy. Users simply need to connect their wallet or download the Best Wallet app if they don‚Äôt already have one. For those without crypto, a bank card can also be used to get started. The $SOLX token has a maximum supply of 138.05 billion while the Solaxy project has been audited by Coinsult.

As a display of the latter, exchanges registered over $2 billion in BTC outflow from their accounts in a week ‚Äì the largest Bitcoin outflow this year. Finbold retrieved data from CoinGlass on December 24, looking at the exchange‚Äôs spot markets over the last seven weeks. From December 15 to today, exchanges saw a $2.12 billion outflow in BTC, which is currently trading at $95,177. This marks the largest weekly spot outflow year-to-date in dollar value, according to CoinGlass , surpassing May‚Äôs $2.03 billion. Notably, the previously largest 2024 outflow triggered a Bitcoin price crash from $58,240 down to $31,778. Historically, significant spot outflows happen during bull rallies , fueled by massive retail demand, buying and withdrawing the BTC to self-custody. However, this increased demand by retail investors could usually signal a price top for Bitcoin and other assets, requiring caution. BTC Spot Inflow/Outflow, 1 week, 2024.

Nearly $1 billion in Bitcoin left the leading crypto exchange in the last seven days, followed distantly by Bitfinex. The second-largest weekly outflow was slightly above $500 million from Tether‚Äôs parent company. Interestingly, the third largest flow was a green one, with Coinbase registering $422 million in Bitcoin deposits inflow. Other exchanges like Bybit, OKX, Kraken , and Bitstamp also registered BTC outflows between $79 million and $260 million. Bitcoin BTC Spot Data Analysis, Heatmap (Net Inflow). Source: CoinGlass Usually, Bitcoin net inflows mean most investors are depositing BTC with the intention of selling. Meanwhile, net outflows would suggest the opposite, with bullish investors withdrawing what they have already bought. It is notable that, given its nature, inflows can usually precede huge price drops, as investors need to deposit before they can sell, being a proactive measurement. On the other hand, investors can only withdraw what they have already bought, so the outflows are a reactive metric and do not necessarily mean the price will increase after a large Bitcoin net outflow. As seen in the historical chart, outflows are a useful sentiment indicator that sometimes signals an upcoming reversal. Featured image from Shutterstock.

38058431,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=376013,1735060217,Russia Extends Regional Crypto Mining Ban to 6 Years as Energy Issues Escalate,"The Russian government has extended its winter ban on local crypto mining operations to six years as energy consumption in the country rises to alarming levels. About a month ago, the government ordered crypto mining entities to pause their operations for the winter season. However, the ban has now been extended. According to a report from local media Tass, the Russian Cabinet of Ministers has banned crypto mining, including local participation in mining pools, in select regions and territories from January 1, 2025, to March 15, 2031. Russia Bans Crypto Mining in Select Regions While the list of affected regions is not final, it includes areas like Dagestan, Ingushetia, Kabardino-Balkaria, Karachay-Cherkessia, North Ossetia, Chechnya, the Donetsk Republic, the Lugansk People‚Äôs Republic, Zaporizhia, and Kherson. The ministers noted that the list remains subject to change based on the government‚Äôs decision on energy development. In addition to the ten areas, the government is temporarily prohibiting crypto mining in some territories in the Irkutsk, Buryatia, and Zabaikalsky Krai regions. These areas will refrain from engaging in mining activities during peak energy consumption periods from January 1 to March 15 in 2025 and from November 15 to March 15 in subsequent years. The Russian government‚Äôs decision stems from the need to maintain the country‚Äôs energy consumption balance. Last year, Russia became the world‚Äôs second-largest crypto miner after the United States, and since then, the country has used at least 16 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity yearly for such activities. High Energy Consumption Issue Currently, crypto mining accounts for 1.5% of Russia‚Äôs overall energy consumption, which has been challenging for regions with harsh climates. Additionally, high energy consumption has created an imbalance in electricity payments across several regions of the country. The government is working towards reducing or eliminating this imbalance. Sergey Kolobanov, deputy director of the Center for the Economy of Fuel and Energy Sectors at the Center for Strategic Research, said: The so-called interregional cross-subsidization, when the low cost of electricity in the regions of regulated contracts is de facto compensated by producers and consumers in other regions. The terms of restrictions on cryptocurrency mining are synchronized with the end of the transition period for the elimination of this benefit. Interestingly, Russia recently legalized crypto mining and introduced a mandatory registration service that allows the Federal Tax Service to obtain information on miners‚Äô assets and crypto wallets.

Daddy Pepe (DADDPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 11,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DADDPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Daddy Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Daddy Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Daddy Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Daddy Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Daddy Pepe by entering its contract address ‚Äì 9UFnMabUe7wecdEEzAYPoQPZiuTJ1hTFpNz6qtsiB3FA ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DADDPEPE.

Table of Contents Ripple‚Äôs XRP price recovering lost ground, trading around $2.2 DTX Exchange: ICO 90% completed Conclusion The anticipation in the cryptocurrency market toward the New Year is rising. Ripple‚Äôs XRP price has recovered its upward trend as it reduced its fall over the past week to single digits. Many indicators hint at another dramatic rise soon. With the crypto markets reaching historic highs, XRP‚Äôs price has attracted new investors. The market remains bullish about the anticipated results of Ripple‚Äôs legal proceedings and the rising adoption of XRP for cross-border use cases. The billion-dollar crypto markets are serving up an all-you-can-earn buffet to investors willing to invest thoughtfully in cryptocurrencies. An underdog contender is set to perform quite well in the next bull run, DTX Exchange (DTX). As the last moments of the year wind up, investors are lining up to buy up DTX Exchange, a new altcoin in the crypto community. DTX uses hybrid methodologies that offer users the best features of centralized and decentralized exchanges. Ripple‚Äôs XRP price recovering lost ground, trading around $2.2 In December 2024, the XRP price surged to new heights and continued until last week, when the price dropped from $2.4 to $1.99. XRP price has been up almost 200% since the US elections, after which it experienced two steep drops in December. Source: CoinMarketCap These were due to overall market drops, and XRP price dropped less than the overall market. XRP‚Äôs price has also recovered quicker so far based on its sound technical performance and bullish sentiments around its future performance. Ripple is ranked as the fourth-largest cryptocurrency according to market cap, trailing Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tether, respectively. The expected launch of Ripple‚Äôs stablecoin, Ripple USD (RLUSD), has boosted XRP price‚Äôs positive momentum. Trading experts and technical crypto analysts are bullish on XRP‚Äôs growth prospects, with price forecasts of $5 and $7 by mid-2025 circulating. The trading technicals are also looking good, with a short-term bearish trend for the day traders, while the long-term traders are getting a buy signal at the current low prices.

In addition to its growth prospects, its future transformation of the crypto trading scene makes it a solid altcoin to hold on to. It merges features from CEX and DEX and removes the gap between TradFi and DeFi, which limits trading across these. DTX is the first crypto-native platform that allows for seamless trade of stock, forex, ETF trading, and over 100,000 currency pairs in one go.

Conclusion For other investors who would like to mirror the success of the current Ripple millionaires, then DTX Exchange is a great option. Its presale is currently moving very quickly, with an expected official launch next year in Q1 2025. DTX could be the next big crypto, providing early backers with life-changing returns.

38061105,https://cryptonews.com/?p=322443,1735060082,Sonic Brings Solana to TikTok ‚Äì Airdrop Frenzy Could Trigger a Massive SOL Rally,"Sonic SVM, the developers of one of the first tap-to-earn (T2E) games available on TikTok, announced that users of the video-sharing platform will also be eligible to receive a portion of its $SONIC airdrop. In a relatively short period, the SonicX game managed to attract over 1 million users after a month of its launch. Meanwhile, once they announced that TikTok users would qualify for the airdrop, they brought in another one million active users. SonicX, a tap-to-earn game built on social video platform TikTok, will airdrop SONIC tokens to its users via Solana's @SonicSVM . Click to read via @ggDecrypt : https://t.co/22qxgKyvTY ‚Äî Decrypt (@DecryptMedia) December 23, 2024 The launch of $SONIC is part of a move to expand the ecosystem of this layer-two project. To participate in the airdrop, users just have to download the app and log in to the social media platform. ‚ÄúSONIC will act as the main currency within the Sonic SVM ecosystem. We aim to onboard billions of TikTok users into the Solana ecosystem and Web3 through our TikTok Chain,‚Äù commented the founder of the protocol, Chris Zhu. The snapshot date has not been announced yet but the developing team emphasized that it will be soon. As a result, users have frantically been signing in to be eligible to receive some tokens. T2E Games like SonicX Attract Millions of Users for Their Simplicity The success of the Notcoin (NOT) Telegram-based T2E game and its corresponding airdrop earlier this year paved the way for SonicX. Currently, the NOT token has a market capitalization of $705 million. One of the reasons for the success of this type of gamve is their simplicity. SonicX onboards users easily and rapidly and allows them to start earning points right away. Meanwhile, the Sonic SVM sees SonicX as proof-of-concept of how its layer-two blockchain can host games and other decentralized applications. They recently announced the launch of new games including Hunting Field and FoMoney. One of the challenges that airdrops have been facing lately involves dealing with farmers. These are speculators who engage and interact with protocols right before their token generation event (TGE) to take advantage of the short-term price spike that typically follows. Protocols have tried different strategies to reduce the chances that sybil wallets and farmers get the largest allocations but they have failed in most cases as it is hard to screen out these addresses without leaving out true supporters in the process as well. The success of Notcoin on Telegram could be extrapolated to SonicX on TikTok. If that turns out to be the case, the upcoming airdrop could be considered an attractive investment opportunity. With a user base of 2.35 billion, TikTok is fertile ground for this kind of game. ‚ÄúSONIC will act as the main currency within the Sonic SVM ecosystem. We aim to onboard billions of TikTok accounts into the Solana ecosystem and Web3 through our TikTok Chain,‚Äù Zhu further emphasized. This Layer-Two Solana Protocol is Already Offering its Token in Presale The Sonic SVM offers an appealing value proposition but this project is already in presale stage and investors and going crazy about it. $SOLX (SOLAXY) ‚Äì World's First Solana L2!

At this stage, each token is priced at $0.001578. However, this discounted price will only be available for less than 37 hours. Many aspects of Solaxy are attractive. First, it offers to solve the congestion issue that has been affecting the efficiency of the Solana mainnet recently amid the rise of meme coins. To achieve this, Solaxy bundles transactions offline and reduces the number of blocks that the Solana network has to validate and record on the main ledger.

38058622,https://thecoinrise.com/injective-and-mercado-bitcoin-partner-boost-defi-in-latam/,1735060035,Injective and Mercado Bitcoin Partner Boost DeFi in LATAM,"In a significant move, Injective (INJ) has officially partnered with Mercado Bitcoin, Latin America‚Äôs oldest cryptocurrency exchange. This integration is poised to open doors to decentralized finance (DeFi) for over three million Mercado Bitcoin users. This move is set to offer a seamless getaway from fiat currencies like the Brazilian Real into the world of Injective‚Äôs advanced ecosystem. Injective‚Äôs Impact: Simplifying Access to DeFi Mercado Bitcoin users can bridge the gap between traditional finance and blockchain technology through this integration. With a fiat-to-crypto on-ramp, Brazilians can participate in Injective‚Äôs ecosystem. The ecosystem already boasts over $43 million in Total Value Locked (TVL), according to Defillama. This development eliminates barriers that often deter newcomers from engaging with DeFi. The integration will offer a streamlined way to invest and interact with innovative financial tools. This announcement, revealed in an X post, has already sparked excitement in the market. Earlier today, INJ prices soared by 15.6%, climbing from a 24-hour low of $20.52 to $23.72 as per market data. This surge reflects the optimism surrounding Injective‚Äôs expanding footprint in Latin America. Mercado Bitcoin: A Pioneer in Financial Innovation Since its founding in 2013, Mercado Bitcoin has grown into one of Latin America‚Äôs largest crypto exchanges, breaking new ground in the industry. It has prioritized financial accessibility and forged strong partnerships with leading blockchain companies. Mercado Bitcoin became the first exchange to integrate Ripple Payments in October , providing faster, cheaper, and more secure cross-border transactions. The move also streamlined treasury operations and allowed direct payments in Brazilian Reais. It enhanced accessibility for retail and corporate users alike. The exchange recently solidified its reputation by listing Ripple‚Äôs dollar-pegged stablecoin, Ripple USD. This move offered traders on the platform more options for digital asset management. This addition is part of the exchange‚Äôs efforts to diversify its offerings and cater to both retail and corporate clients. Mercado Bitcoin isn‚Äôt just leading within Latin America; its global partnerships speak volumes. In May 2024, it joined forces with Mastercard to enable live transactions across Latin American and European corridors, a collaboration that underscored the exchange‚Äôs commitment to creating a global financial network. Global Aspirations with Local Impact Mercado Bitcoin‚Äôs partnerships have extended beyond Latin America. This year, the exchange collaborated with Mastercard , enabling live transactions across Latin America and European corridors. This collaboration shows its ambition to create a truly global financial network while addressing local needs. The Injective integration supports Mercado Bitcoin‚Äôs mission to make financial tools accessible to everyone. It goes beyond introducing DeFi to the public, aiming to empower everyday users with tools once reserved for institutions.

38058313,https://coinpedia.org/?p=397461,1735060000,Kraken and SEC File Joint Stipulation in Ongoing Discovery Dispute,"The post Kraken and SEC File Joint Stipulation in Ongoing Discovery Dispute appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In the latest development, crypto exchange Kraken and the US SEC have filed a joint stipulation and proposed order. The action comes as Kraken plans to file an objection to a recent order issued in favor of the SEC. According to a court filing dated December 23, the plaintiff US SEC and defendants Payward Inc and Payward Ventures (together, crypto exchange Kraken) have submitted a stipulation. Parties File Joint Statement On November 19, 2024, the Parties filed a joint statement regarding a discovery dispute concerning the SEC‚Äôs objections to Kraken‚Äôs requests for three categories of documents concerning: Bitcoin and Ether, the SEC‚Äôs public statements and testimony regarding digital assets, and the SEC‚Äôs internal trading policies on digital assets, However, in November, the court referred discovery disputes and all further discovery in this case to Magistrate Judge Robert M. Illman, who subsequently denied Kraken‚Äôs request to compel the production of the discovery. Despite this, Kraken believes that the documents are relevant to the case. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ripple CTO David Schwartz Shares Insights on Crypto Staking Amid Tax Debate , SEC, Kraken Agree To Stay Deadline While the deadline to file objections to the order is December 30, Kraken intends to resubmit narrowed requests for production in line with the order. Notably, the US SEC and Kraken have agreed to stay the deadline to file objections to the order until March 31, 2025, to discuss a further extension. Kraken is represented by prominent lawyer Matthew C. Solomon, who is known for many high-profile cases including successfully defending Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse in obtaining the dismissal with prejudice and successful defense of all other claims on summary judgment. Kraken requested an order to compel the SEC to produce documents explaining why Bitcoin and Ether were not included in the SEC‚Äôs complaint, despite being traded similarly to other tokens on the platform. However, the magistrate judge found Kraken‚Äôs argument ‚Äúunpersuasive.‚Äù Notably, Kraken and the broader crypto industry have asserted that former SEC official William Hinman‚Äôs speech is relevant to determining the status of Bitcoin and Ether under federal securities laws. Kraken has also argued for the fair notice defense and the major questions doctrine in the lawsuit. Ripple CLO Calls For End To The Ripple vs SEC Lawsuit Recently, Ripple CLO Stuart Alderoty also called for an end to the Ripple vs SEC lawsuit . He urged the incoming Trump administration to ‚Äúcleanse the lingering stain of Hinman from the agency.‚Äù ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs much more to do to repair the damage, but let‚Äôs start by restoring trust,‚Äù he noted. On this 4th anniversary of the SEC‚Äôs lawless lawsuit against Ripple, Brad, & Chris, we urge the incoming administration to cleanse the lingering stain of Hinman from the agency.

38058282,https://crypto.news/?p=14322016,1735059988,Shiba Inu whale expects this coin to outperform DOGE and XRP in the $1 price race,"Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Shiba Inu whales eye Lightchain AI at $0.003, a rising altcoin poised to outshine Dogecoin and XRP in growth. Table of Contents Why Shiba Inu whales are focusing on LCAI Why LCAI Could outperform DOGE and XRP in the race to $1 Will LCAI reach $1? Here‚Äôs what experts say Comparing LCAI to DOGE and XRP Lightchain AI is set to dominate the market As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, Shiba Inu (SHIB) whales are now turning their attention to a new contender ‚Äî Lightchain AI (LCAI). Priced at just $0.003, this emerging altcoin has garnered significant interest from investors, including major players who believe LCAI will outperform Dogecoin (DOGE) and XRP in the race to hit $1. In this article, we will explore why Lightchain AI is gaining momentum and how it could potentially eclipse these popular tokens in the near future. You might also like: Cardano and Toncoin take a backseat as Lightchain AI presale shines Why Shiba Inu whales are focusing on LCAI Shiba Inu, known for its fun rise, has had large price jumps driven by communÕèity support and celebrity backing it. But, Lightchain AI is a coin that shows hope for long-term growth supported by fresh tech instead of only talk. This shift in investor focus from SHIB big players to LCAI shows that more people are finding true worth in the crypto space. Unlike a dog that lacks great uses beyond its funny charm, and a XRP that mainly serves as a money tool LCAI mixes blocks and AI to fix many real world problems making it a more interesting choice for investing. With a tiny presale fee of just $0.003, LCAI offers great chances for profit especially when compared with more popular tokens like DOGE and XRP. For an investor the current presale time of LCAI shows a unique chance to join a plan at its start with large growth likely as AI keeps changing areas all around the world. Why LCAI Could outperform DOGE and XRP in the race to $1 While XRP has seen significant price action based on its utility in the cross-border payments market and DOGE remains a beloved meme coin, Lightchain AI has the potential to outperform them both for several reasons. Technological Disruption: LCAI is leveraging the power of artificial intelligence and blockchain, making it one of the few projects positioned at the intersection of two rapidly growing sectors. Market Demand for AI Solutions: As industries increasingly adopt AI technologies, LCAI‚Äôs ability to power decentralized AI applications gives it a competitive edge in terms of both real-world utility and scalability. Strong Long-Term Vision: With key milestones on its roadmap, including the mainnet launch and increasing integration with various sectors, LCAI is poised to make a lasting impact on the market, unlike many meme coins. Will LCAI reach $1? Here‚Äôs what experts say Many cryptocurrency experts believe that Lightchain AI has the potential to surpass $1 in the near future. This optimism is driven by several factors. First, LCAI‚Äôs deflationary token model reduces its circulating supply through token burns, which, combined with increasing demand, is expected to drive its price upwards. Additionally, the growing adoption of AI-powered blockchain solutions positions LCAI as a highly relevant and scalable project with real-world applications that go beyond traditional cryptocurrencies. Finally, its low entry price during the presale offers a unique opportunity for early investors to benefit from its long-term potential. Comparing LCAI to DOGE and XRP Let‚Äôs take a look at the key differences between LCAI, DOGE, and XRP. Feature Lightchain AI Dogecoin XRP Technology AI + Blockchain Meme coin Payment solution Consensus Mechanism Proof of Intelligence Proof of Stake RippleNet Market Focus AI applications Community-driven hype Cross-border payments Price Potential High (100x+) Low to moderate Moderate Tokenomics Deflationary Inflationary Inflationary Lightchain AI is set to dominate the market Lightchain AI offers a unique combination of AI-powered blockchain solutions that make it a standout player in the cryptocurrency market. As Shiba Inu whales shift their focus towards LCAI, the altcoin‚Äôs 100x potential presents a compelling investment opportunity. With a low presale price of $0.003 and a projected value of $1 by 2025, LCAI is positioned to deliver unprecedented returns. It‚Äôs time to invest early before Lightchain AI takes the market by storm. So, for those looking to invest in a project with real-world utility and long-term potential, don‚Äôt overlook Lightchain AI .

38058144,https://finbold.com/?p=222607,1735059675,Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening with Rumble (RUM) stock this week,"Rumble Inc. (NASDAQ: RUM ), a video-sharing platform, made headlines this week as its stock surged over 100% on December 23, reaching $14.30. The rally comes on the back of a $775 million investment announcement from Tether, the issuer of the leading stablecoin USDT , marking Rumble‚Äôs highest close since September 2022. As of press time, Rumble‚Äôs stock is trading at $13.30, reflecting a five-day gain of 63%. On a year-to-date basis, the stock has surged an impressive 206%, reflecting heightened investor interest. Rumble year-to-date price chart. Source: Finbold Tether‚Äôs $775 million investment on Rumble The announcement revealed that Tether has agreed to purchase approximately 103.3 million shares of Rumble‚Äôs Class A Common Stock at $7.50 per share. This transaction will generate gross proceeds of $775 million, significantly strengthening Rumble‚Äôs financial position, which already benefits from holding more cash than debt. Rumble has outlined a clear plan for utilizing the funds. Of the total, $250 million will support growth initiatives aimed at enhancing platform engagement and monetization, while $525 million will finance a self-tender offer to repurchase up to 70 million shares of Class A Common Stock at the same $7.50 price offered to Tether. This tender offer is designed to provide liquidity to stockholders and reinforce shareholder value. ‚ÄúI truly believe Tether is the perfect partner that can put a rocket pack on the back of Rumble as we prepare for our next phase of growth.‚Äù- Chris Pavlovski, Rumble‚Äôs Chairman and CEO, Interestingly, this agreement comes shortly after Rumble‚Äôs board approved allocating a portion of its cash reserves to Bitcoin ( BTC ), with plans to purchase up to $20 million in the cryptocurrency. Revenue growth and user metrics The recent surge in Rumble‚Äôs stock price has brought renewed attention to the company, which competes with major players like YouTube and Odysee. Rumble‚Äôs revenue has shown consistent growth, with the company reporting $25.06 million for the quarter ending September 30, 2024, a 39.34% year-over-year increase. Over the past 12 months, Rumble‚Äôs revenue climbed to $85.65 million, up 6.36% compared to the prior year. The platform‚Äôs global monthly active users (MAUs) have also increased , rising to an average of 67 million in Q3 2024 from 53 million in Q2 2024. However, the average revenue per user (ARPU) dropped to $0.33 in Q3 from $0.37 in the previous quarter, indicating room for improvement in monetization. Analyst views and valuation concerns Despite the excitement surrounding Tether‚Äôs investment, questions remain about Rumble‚Äôs valuation and growth prospects. Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein notes that while the $775 million equity investment strengthens Rumble‚Äôs balance sheet and alleviates liquidity concerns, the valuation appears ahead of its current advertising and subscription revenue performance.

During the week following Christmas, the total market cap of cryptocurrencies increased by as much as 11.87%! This year, as the market prepares for another Santa Claus Rally, Monero (XMR), Litecoin (LTC), and BlockDAG (BDAG) are poised to lead with their promising growth potential. Monero has experienced a 50% increase in the past month thanks to its strong focus on privacy. Meanwhile, Litecoin has shown remarkable resilience after a 13.59% decrease last week, positioning itself for a potential 15% gain. BlockDAG (BDAG) is at the forefront of the festive surge. Its sophisticated DAG-based framework and compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), detailed in the newly released Whitepaper V3, provide unmatched scalability and ease for developers. With a bullish market forecast, analysts are optimistic about BlockDAG‚Äôs potential to reach a $1 price point, as the crypto sector heads into its most vibrant season. Monero Set for Rally Gains Amid Privacy Focus Monero remains in the spotlight as the market anticipates the Santa Claus Rally. This privacy-centric cryptocurrency has surged nearly 50% recently, trading between $172 and $250. Analysts believe Monero could overcome its $278 resistance, potentially reaching $356 if the rally strengthens. With technical indicators like the RSI and Stochastic showing that Monero is potentially undervalued, a rebound may be on the horizon. Monero‚Äôs commitment to secure, anonymous transactions continues to attract attention, underlining its appeal. Litecoin‚Äôs Resilience Poised to Turn Profitable Despite a recent dip of 13.59%, Litecoin‚Äôs price is stabilizing between $103 and $136.79. It has recovered impressively, showing nearly 40% growth this month and a 60% increase over six months. Analysts suggest that breaking the $152 resistance could lead to a further 15% price increase. Market indicators, including an RSI of 40.49 and a Stochastic at 18.92, indicate that Litecoin might be approaching oversold territory, setting the stage for potential gains. With the holiday season fueling the Santa Claus Rally and sparking renewed interest in trading, Litecoin‚Äôs reputation for swift and cost-efficient transactions positions it for potential success. BlockDAG‚Äôs Whitepaper V3 & Price Surge Fuel Holiday Market Dynamics BlockDAG stands on the cusp of significant recognition during the much-anticipated Santa Claus Rally, capitalizing on its developer-centric blockchain technology to draw considerable interest. The release of Whitepaper V3 underscores BlockDAG‚Äôs sophisticated Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology, seamlessly integrated with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This integration appeals to developers with its straightforward deployment using platforms like Remix, Hardhat, and Truffle, facilitating the launch of decentralized applications (dApps) that are both scalable and efficient. Impressive presale achievements underscore BlockDAG‚Äôs momentum, with more than $172 million raised and over 17.5 billion BDAG coins distributed. With a current presale price of $0.0234 per coin in batch 26, early participants have realized a remarkable 2240% ROI. Analysts suggest that BlockDAG‚Äôs distinctive attributes and recent advancements may lead to increased activity during December‚Äôs Santa Claus Rally, potentially elevating the BDAG coin‚Äôs price to $1 by the following year. Currently a leading contender among presale crypto assets, BlockDAG‚Äôs scalable DAG infrastructure meets the growing demand for high-throughput solutions in modern applications, while its compatibility with Ethereum tools offers a familiar environment for developers. The timing of BlockDAG‚Äôs advancements perfectly coincides with the holiday rally, providing market participants with an enticing chance to engage with a project set to revolutionize the blockchain industry. BlockDAG is establishing itself as a significant force in the Layer 1 arena, ready to benefit from the anticipated market expansion this December, supported by festive market enthusiasm. Seize the Moment in the Holiday Crypto Wave! The Santa Claus Rally is already catalyzing market action, with major players making significant moves. Monero is positioned to potentially hit $356, Litecoin is gearing up for a strong rebound, and BlockDAG‚Äôs evolutionary potential could escalate its price from $0.0234 to $1 by next year. Participants are eagerly joining BlockDAG‚Äôs crypto presale following the impactful release of Whitepaper V3, which elaborates on its pioneering DAG technology and EVM compatibility. However, the window to acquire BDAG at $0.0234 is narrowing quickly. This holiday season could mark a critical pivot for traders‚Äîif they act swiftly before the rally concludes.

38058243,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=632911,1735059463,Binance is on a delisting spree ‚Äì What‚Äôs the exchange‚Äôs 2025 trading plan?,"In December 2024, Binance, the world‚Äôs leading cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, ramped up its efforts to maintain a high-quality and secure trading environment by delisting a number of tokens. The exchange‚Äôs decisions come amid ongoing market uncertainty and regulatory pressure, signaling a more cautious approach as it prepares for the challenges of 2025. With Bitcoin‚Äôs price falling below the $100K mark, investor confidence is low, and the overall market sentiment is one of caution. For Binance, ensuring that only the most reliable tokens remain on the platform is imperative as it seeks to maintain its reputation as a secure and trusted exchange. Binance‚Äôs recent delistings: Stringent standards in play? On December 6, Binance announced the removal of two spot trading pairs: NOT/BNB and RDNT/BTC. This followed the exchange‚Äôs routine process of periodically reviewing listed assets to ensure they meet stringent requirements for liquidity, trading volume, and network security. Binance made it clear that such actions were necessary to protect its users and uphold the integrity of its platform, especially in times of market volatility. Additionally, more tokens are set to be delisted on December 25, 2024. These included tokens such as Kaon (AKRO), Bluzelle (BLZ), and WazirX (WRX). While these tokens were removed from the platform‚Äôs main trading pairs, Binance clarified that they could still be traded with other pairs on the platform. Other trading pairs to be removed from the exchange include ACE/BTC, ACM/TRY, BOME/BTC, DYM/BTC, MTL/TRY, PIXEL/BNB, PIXEL/FDUSD, QKC/BTC, RAD/BTC, REZ/FDUSD, TUSD/TRY, all on Dec 27. In a statement, Binance emphasized its ongoing evaluation process for tokens listed on its platform. The exchange explained that it periodically reviews assets to ensure they align with its high standards. If a token fails to meet these standards or if industry dynamics change, Binance may decide to delist it. Furthermore, Binance takes into account any evidence of unethical conduct or negligence related to the token in question. As regulatory requirements evolve, the exchange ensures that its listed assets comply with new legal standards to maintain a secure and trusted marketplace for its users. The WazirX incident: Reasons for Binance to tread carefully The delisting of WRX, WazirX‚Äôs native token, on December 25, 2024, was directly linked to the ongoing troubles at the Indian exchange. The Delhi High Court had, just days earlier on December 18, ordered a fresh investigation into WazirX, stemming from a significant hack in July 2024, which resulted in a $235 million loss in cryptocurrency. The breach, attributed to a North Korean hacking group, raised significant concerns about the platform‚Äôs security measures and transparency. Binance delisting wazirX WRX token, is the best thing. . Coz few days back WRX the dead exchange token, all of a sudden started pumping 20 to 30%, like why anyone in their right mind would buy this token?üßê . So nice of binance, to finally delist it, all exchanges should do it.üôå ‚Äî Jay‚Çøitcoins.ai‚ö°Ô∏è (@JayBitcoins) December 19, 2024 Despite a partial recovery of the stolen funds, 43% of customer assets remain unrecoverable. The court‚Äôs decision to mandate a renewed investigation into WazirX, particularly in light of allegations of financial irregularities, compounded the exchange‚Äôs already fragile position. Binance, which has faced its own scrutiny in connection to WazirX in the past, confirmed that it no longer holds control over the exchange. Binance stated that WazirX is operated by Zanmai Labs, an entity under the jurisdiction of India‚Äôs Financial Intelligence Unit. The Wazirx exchange token experienced a severe dump yesterday due to the news of its delisting from Binance exchange, and its price dropped by nearly 60%. But I don't think this token will disappear like FTT exchange. Was there a buying opportunity at this point? We'll see. üòâ‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/whEHSHs2ax ‚Äî Aboozar (@Aboozar_trader) December 19, 2024 Following the delisting, WRX experienced a dramatic 59% drop in value, signaling a loss of investor confidence in both the token and the exchange. Binance Alpha mishap sees investors accrue big losses Binance caused a stir when it posted a list of ‚Äúalpha watchlist tokens‚Äù to one of its official Telegram channels. The post, which highlighted five early-stage crypto projects, triggered a sudden spike in the prices of the mentioned tokens. However, the exchange later clarified that the information was inaccurate, resulting in the tokens losing their newly gained value. The post identified Wise Monkey (MONKY), Happy Cat (HAPPY), Rifampicin (RIF), Zircuit (ZRC), and ai16zeliza (ELIZA) as projects with ‚Äústrong fundamentals‚Äù and ‚Äúactive communities.‚Äù Speculation quickly spread among traders that the Telegram group could be a fake attempt to manipulate the market. As reported by Cryptopolitan , the post had originated from binance_web3_wallet_community, an official Binance channel. Following the clarification, the price of MONKY surged by 38% before plummeting by 22% when the false nature of the announcement was confirmed. One trader suffered significant losses, buying 1.42 million ELIZA tokens at $0.1376, only to see the price fall after the correction was issued. The trader was forced to panic sell at $0.09567, with the remaining position liquidated at just $0.01157, resulting in a $102,000 loss within 12 minutes. Binance‚Äôs Outlook for 2025: A Focus on High-Quality Assets As Binance moves into 2025, its trading strategy appears centered around fostering a more curated and secure marketplace. Binance‚Äôs approach reflects a growing trend among exchanges to streamline their offerings in the face of growing regulatory scrutiny and evolving market conditions. The exchange is expected to continue its practice of periodically reviewing all tokens listed on its platform, ensuring they meet standards like having a strong, committed project team, technological improvements, high levels of trading activity and liquidity, with a safe, stable network environment Binance has also been under increased regulatory pressure in several jurisdictions, and staying ahead of new regulatory developments could be a priority moving forward. It will also likely expand its focus on the US, riding on President-elect Trump‚Äôs pro-crypto stance.

He defines a digital commodity as an asset without an issuer backed by digital power, such as Bitcoin, and a digital security as an asset backed by a security, such as equity or debt.

Titled ‚ÄúMoney Laundering and Blockchain: Can You Follow Their Footsteps in the Crypto World?‚Äù the report sheds light on platforms that enable Bitcoin trading without requiring Know Your Customer (KYC) verification. According to the bank, these services create opportunities for criminals to conceal the origins of illicit funds and complicate law enforcement efforts to track transactions. The report notes that such platforms often operate in jurisdictions with weak anti-money laundering (AML) regulations or in countries designated as high-risk by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). The bank argues that this lack of oversight allows bad actors to exploit gaps in the global financial system. Related News: BREAKING : Donald Trump's Crypto Council Director is Announced - It Wasn't Expected One interesting aspect of the report is that it mentions events such as ‚ÄúSatoshi Spritz,‚Äù where people gather to exchange Bitcoin for goods or fiat currency.

Crypto shifts focus to Lightchain AI, blending AI and blockchain at $0.003, with analysts eyeing it as the next big altcoin. Table of Contents Why LCAI is gaining traction after the market correction Post-correction market opportunity Can LCAI outperform SOL and XRP in 2025? Future of LCAI looks bright After recent market corrections, crypto analysts are now on the lookout for the next big opportunity in digital currency. While Solana (SOL) and Ripple (XRP) seem to be stabilizing, the spotlight is shifting to Lightchain AI (LCAI), an up-and-coming altcoin priced at just $0.003. With its unique mix of artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology, LCAI has been catching the attention of investors eager for something with high-growth potential. The buzz is only growing thanks to the ongoing Lightchain AI presale , giving early supporters a chance to snag LCAI before it potentially takes off. In this article, we‚Äôll explore why many believe LCAI could outperform big names like Solana and XRP, possibly becoming the breakout coin of 2025 and beyond. Stay tuned! Why LCAI is gaining traction after the market correction Lightchain AI is gaining traction after the market correction due to its unique combination of utility, unique features, and a forward-looking roadmap that resonates with both developers and investors. Unlike guesswork coins, LCAI gives real uses by its Proof of Intelligence (PoI) way, which rewards good AI work and its Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), made for easy running of AI jobs on the blockchain. These traits place LCAI as a useful fix in fields like health care; money and shippingÕè, boosting steady need. Also, LCAI‚Äôs token system that lowers the amount by burning fees from transactions gives a good value for investors wanting to make money over time. Its aim of growing the ecosystem, worldwide use, and smart connections helps keep growth going, even when the market is unstable. By tackling real-life problems with new tech, LCAI has come forward as a strong and hopeful project after market correction. You might also like: Cardano and Toncoin take a backseat as Lightchain AI presale shines Post-correction market opportunity The crypto market has been volatile recently, with tokens like Solana and XRP facing major corrections. However, this presents a chance for investors to explore undervalued altcoins with strong growth potential. LCAI, priced at $0.003, offers an appealing entry point for diversifying portfolios before the next rally. Here‚Äôs why LCAI could outperform SOL and XRP. Technological Edge While Solana and XRP focus on speed and transaction efficiency, LCAI combines AI with blockchain to meet the rising demand for AI-powered solutions, offering real-world applications beyond finance. Growing Adoption With AI adoption accelerating, LCAI‚Äôs blockchain-AI integration is attracting developers and businesses seeking scalable, secure, and transparent tools. From AI-powered governance to predictive analytics and supply chain optimization, LCAI offers wide-ranging use cases, driving adoption across sectors. Strategic Roadmap LCAI‚Äôs roadmap includes key milestones like the testnet launch in early 2025 and the mainnet launch, which will expand its user base and real-world applications. These developments are expected to boost its market appeal and price potential. Can LCAI outperform SOL and XRP in 2025? Lightchain AI (LCAI) has the potential to outperform both Solana and XRP in 2025 due to its unique integration of blockchain and artificial intelligence, setting it apart in a crowded market. Unlike Solana, which focuses on transaction speed and scalability, and XRP, which targets cross-border payments, LCAI addresses broader real-world applications across industries like healthcare, finance, and supply chain management. Its Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism and Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) enable the execution of AI-driven tasks, adding practical utility and innovation beyond traditional blockchain functionalities. Additionally, LCAI‚Äôs deflationary tokenomics enhance long-term value by reducing supply through transaction fee burning. Its detailed roadmap, emphasizing ecosystem growth, global adoption, and strategic partnerships, ensures sustained development and market expansion. By combining technological advancement, scalable solutions, and real-world utility, LCAI is positioned to attract a broader user base and investor interest, potentially surpassing SOL and XRP in growth and adoption by 2025. Future of LCAI looks bright With LCAI‚Äôs advanced technology, strong tokenomics, and massive growth potential, it is poised to outperform Solana and Ripple in 2025 and beyond. While XRP and Solana have dominated the market in the past, LCAI‚Äôs focus on AI-powered blockchain solutions gives it a distinct edge in the ever-evolving digital currency landscape. For investors looking to capitalize on LCAI‚Äôs growth before it explodes in value, now could be the time to get involved. With a price prediction of $3 or more by 2025, LCAI could be the next big crypto breakout. Don‚Äôt miss out on the opportunity to invest in LCAI before it‚Äôs too late.

38057739,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=632898,1735058528,What are the real use cases for the so-hyped memecoins?,"Memecoins‚Äô position in digital culture and celebrity sponsorships have raised their notoriety. Many connect them with entertainment rather than usability. Recently, they attracted traders because of large returns. Only a few of these coins have practical value. However, they have routinely outperformed real-world use case projects. Also, they have made the crypto industry more popular because of this nature. Over the years, the memecoin market has consistently been reliant on a single essential component, which is the community. In comparison to traditional crypto, which prioritizes technological advancements and usefulness, these coins flourish on their emotional resonance, cultural relevance, and storytelling. Memecoins can evade US securities law In the second quarter of 2024, memecoins accounted for 14.3% of the market share on CoinGecko, making them the most significant crypto narrative. The fact that memecoins are useless is one use case. They bypass the US securities regulations. These regulations have caused damage to the crypto industry for example, they stopped the ICO growth. Furthermore, the Australian Securities and Investment Commission‚Äôs proposed expanded crypto powers do not specifically include memecoins. A16z Crypto managing partner Chris Dixon said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs actually safer to release a memecoin today with no use case than it is to launch a token that‚Äôs useful.‚Äù Also, The Howey test is the primary focus of US securities law in determining what comprises an investment contract. The test does not capture memecoins, which are merely an idea. Is it possible that they will dissipate now that Donald Trump is the incoming president and Paul Atkins is the presumptive new SEC supervisor? The SEC chairman may permit ‚Äúreal‚Äù projects to raise money again through a mechanism similar to Hester Peirce‚Äôs 2020 ‚Äúsafe harbor‚Äù proposal. Memecoins let users capture the political zeitgeist Memecoins enable holders to engage with and capture the political zeitgeist in a world where individuals use technology to establish social connections. These coins have been developed in support of and opposition to both candidates in the US presidential election. Source: CoinMarketCap For instance, Javier Milei , the libertarian president of Argentina, has a memecoin that is dedicated to his reforms. The social usefulness of enabling individuals to communicate their political opinions through monetary donations could be compared to the text-to-donate initiatives implemented by significant campaigns. Trump‚Äôs new best friend and future Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) boss, Elon Musk, is another prime example. He made Dogecoin become the gold standard in this uncertain realm of Web3. Daniel Drescher, vice president of business development at Sal‚ÄôAd Labs, prefers to think of memecoins as ‚ÄúBrandcoins.‚Äù Often, they need a key opinion leader or a personality cult to power that coin. The coins also thrive on silly things. For instance, Kamala Harris memes experienced an increase in popularity immediately following Joe Biden‚Äôs fall from a staircase, which resulted in his removal as the Democratic Party‚Äôs presidential nominee. Memecoins do charitable things as well as funding projects escaping VCs Memecoins have been used as Trojan horses to finance more significant initiatives. This includes the establishment of a casino akin to Iggy Azalea‚Äôs Motherland. Also, the establishment of an exchange akin to ShibaSwap or the fundraising for charitable causes. Vitalik Buterin of Ethereum is well known for donating memecoins to charity. He wrote, ‚ÄúAmong the more interesting of the coins that I‚Äôve seen are coins where a large portion of the token supply is dedicated to some kind of charity. ‚Äù For instance, the Neiro Foundation is a global coalition that provides financial support and essential resources to dog shelters and charities that enhance the lives of Shiba Inus by funding Shiba Inu dog rescues and wellbeing initiatives. In addition, these coins are contributing to the funding and launch of agents on the Virtuals Protocol, which enables AI agents to interact with tokenomics designs. Consequently, autonomous DAOs may well result from AI agents. However, they are currently concentrated on the memecoin robo-trading end of the spectrum. Bots like Truth Terminal interact with users on platforms like X. This generates artificial excitement and shilling for community participation and the purchase of memecoins. According to Calanthia Mei, co-founder of Masa, there is a significant gap between ‚Äúintelligent AI agent memecoins‚Äù and ‚Äúdumb memecoins.‚Äù Mei, who was previously a founding member of PayPal‚Äôs venture capital arm, discusses ‚Äúmemecoin sentience,‚Äù which refers to the intersection of AI and memecoins, in which AI agents execute duties, such as conducting transactions. These trendy coins do more than just make money; they also make technology cool. They bring attention to technologies that not many people are interested in. Zhen Yu Yong, CEO of Web3Auth, said that memecoins are useful for a new type of funding vehicle. Still, according to Masa‚Äôs Mei, memecoins provide much-needed financial resources to develop their tech, escaping frosty VC markets and Web3 echo chambers. In a viral Supercycle talk at Token2049, Murad Mahmudov contended that completely unlocked memecoins result in the tokenized meme being the actual product. There are no lock-up periods or VCs. Due to its lack of revenue, the asset‚Äôs inability to be valued becomes advantageous. Clearly, the retail appeal is influenced by the absence of VC funding for the majority of memecoins. Degens who were unable to capitalize on Bitcoin in 2010, ETH, or any of the other major currencies can achieve immediate wealth without the interference of VCs in the pre-seed round.

This shift reflects varying investor sentiment during the holiday season amidst ongoing market volatility. Key Insights Into ETF Activity Despite the overall outflows, BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT stood out with a net inflow of $31.78 million , suggesting continued confidence among investors in the world‚Äôs largest asset manager‚Äôs Bitcoin fund. On the other hand, major outflows were recorded across several ETFs: Fidelity‚Äôs FBTC : $146 million Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC : $38.4 million Bitwise‚Äôs BITB : $23.7 million Invesco‚Äôs BTCO : $25.6 million ARK Invest‚Äôs ARKB : $15.7 million Grayscale‚Äôs Mini BTC : $6.2 million VanEck‚Äôs HODL : $2.6 million Other ETFs reported minimal or no significant net flows. Factors Influencing the Outflows The net outflows indicate a period of caution among investors, driven by: Year-End Portfolio Adjustments Many investors rebalance their portfolios during the year-end, which could contribute to these withdrawals. Market Volatility Bitcoin has seen significant price fluctuations, raising concerns over near-term risks. Institutional Strategy Changes Institutional investors might be re-evaluating their strategies, leading to temporary shifts in capital. BlackRock‚Äôs Resilience Amid Outflows While most ETFs faced declines, BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT recorded notable inflows. This resilience underscores BlackRock‚Äôs growing influence in the cryptocurrency sector and its reputation as a trusted brand among retail and institutional investors alike. Implications for Bitcoin and ETF Markets The combined outflows emphasize the short-term uncertainty in Bitcoin‚Äôs trajectory. However, consistent inflows into select funds like BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT suggest that institutional confidence in Bitcoin remains intact. This divergence highlights the importance of ETF management and branding in attracting and retaining investor capital. Conclusion The net outflows from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs signal cautious investor sentiment but also showcase pockets of resilience, particularly in BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT. With the cryptocurrency market navigating a volatile period, ETF flows will remain a critical indicator of market dynamics and institutional confidence in Bitcoin.

Demand is so high that some experts even foresee a potential 800% surge for this crypto coin in 2025. DTX Exchange seen as a rising star with 500% gains so far While Cardano and Ethereum are seeing some red price charts, DTX Exchange is showing some growth. Its crypto ICO event performance has been great, having raised over $10m and given early buyers a 500% return. Plus, the recent CoinMarketCap listing of DTX may increase demand for it as millions of new traders could set their sights on it. This new exchange token will have utility and bring many benefits to holders. These will include: Staking rewards: DTX holders who stake their tokens will get up to 15% APY in staking rewards.

The expiration of $20 billion worth of BTC and Ether (ETH) options on December 27 could be a catalyst for market movement. Bitcoin‚Äôs Struggles Above $100,000 QCP Capital highlighted Bitcoin‚Äôs difficulty in maintaining its position above the $100,000 threshold. This struggle could lead to a rotation of capital into altcoins , replicating patterns observed during similar market phases last month.

Similarly, SUI, a blockchain platform that once promised to shake things up, is now grappling with downward pressure that has left its supporters scratching their heads. The question on everyone‚Äôs mind? Which cryptos are worth your attention right now? While BTC and SUI navigate these rough waters, Qubetics ($TICS) is charting its own course‚Äîand it‚Äôs all smooth sailing. With over $7.5 million raised in its presale and a groundbreaking approach to blockchain development, Qubetics is proving that innovation and real-world solutions can thrive even in a bearish market. Unlike its counterparts, Qubetics isn‚Äôt just about token prices or market speculation; it‚Äôs about utility, solving real problems, and paving the way for a more efficient digital future. Let‚Äôs dive into why Qubetics, with its innovative QubeQode IDE application, is the crypto to watch in December 2024 . We‚Äôll also take a closer look at Bitcoin and SUI to understand where they stand and what‚Äôs ahead for these blockchain giants. Qubetics: Pioneering Innovation with QubeQode IDE Now, let‚Äôs talk about Qubetics ($TICS), the breakout star of December 2024. Unlike Bitcoin and SUI, Qubetics isn‚Äôt weighed down by market trends or unmet expectations. It‚Äôs blazing a trail of its own, backed by a presale that‚Äôs already raised over $7.5 million. With more than 372 million tokens sold to over 11,500 holders, Qubetics isn‚Äôt just another blockchain project; it‚Äôs a movement. One of the standout features of Qubetics is its QubeQode Integrated Development Environment (IDE) . This isn‚Äôt just a tool; it‚Äôs a game-changer. QubeQode simplifies blockchain development in ways that were previously unimaginable. Imagine you‚Äôre a developer looking to build a decentralised app. Normally, you‚Äôd have to navigate complex coding languages, fragmented tools, and countless hours of troubleshooting. With QubeQode, all that complexity is streamlined. It‚Äôs like going from a manual typewriter to a high-tech word processor‚Äîa total upgrade. For businesses, QubeQode offers unparalleled efficiency. Picture a fintech startup wanting to launch a crypto payment platform . With QubeQode, they can prototype, test, and deploy their app faster than ever. Professionals in industries ranging from healthcare to supply chain management can also benefit, using QubeQode to integrate blockchain solutions without needing an army of developers. For individuals, QubeQode opens up opportunities that were once out of reach. Ever dreamed of creating your own token or smart contract? With QubeQode, even those without a tech background can get involved. It‚Äôs democratising blockchain development, making it accessible to anyone with a vision and a bit of curiosity. Bitcoin: The OG Struggles to Maintain Its Crown Bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency, has been a household name for over a decade. It‚Äôs the benchmark against which all other cryptos are measured. But even legends stumble, and Bitcoin‚Äôs recent performance has been far from stellar. After hitting new heights earlier this year, BTC has faced significant downward pressure, leaving investors both seasoned and new wondering if it‚Äôs time to reassess. The trouble started when macroeconomic factors‚Äîyes, those pesky interest rates again‚Äîbegan taking their toll. The Federal Reserve‚Äôs hawkish stance sent shockwaves through global markets, and Bitcoin wasn‚Äôt spared. While many hoped BTC would act as a hedge against inflation, its recent price movements have shown it‚Äôs still susceptible to broader market trends. Add to this the increasing scrutiny from regulators worldwide, and you‚Äôve got a recipe for volatility. Bitcoin‚Äôs biggest strength has always been its simplicity. It‚Äôs digital gold, a store of value, a decentralised alternative to fiat currencies. But in a market where innovation drives interest, Bitcoin‚Äôs lack of new features can feel like a limitation. Sure, it‚Äôs reliable, and its network is as secure as ever. But for those looking for the top cryptos to join in December 2024, Bitcoin‚Äôs appeal might be more about nostalgia than future potential. SUI: A Promising Project Hits a Snag SUI, a relatively new player in the crypto world, came out swinging with bold promises of scalability and decentralised app support. Built with a focus on speed and efficiency, SUI positioned itself as the blockchain that could handle the demands of modern applications without breaking a sweat. For a while, it seemed like it was living up to the hype. But December 2024 has been a tough month for SUI. The token‚Äôs price has dipped, following broader market trends and a series of less-than-stellar updates from its development team. While SUI‚Äôs technology remains impressive, it‚Äôs struggled to maintain the momentum needed to capture market share in a crowded space. Competing with established platforms like Ethereum and Solana is no small feat, and SUI‚Äôs growing pains are becoming increasingly evident. Part of SUI‚Äôs challenge lies in its positioning. While its high throughput and developer-friendly environment are attractive, these aren‚Äôt unique selling points anymore. The blockchain world moves fast, and what‚Äôs groundbreaking today can feel dated tomorrow. For those evaluating the top cryptos to join in December 2024, SUI offers potential but also significant risks. It‚Äôs a project to watch, but perhaps not one to jump into just yet. What Is QubeQode IDE? If you‚Äôre wondering what makes QubeQode so special, here‚Äôs the scoop. An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is like a Swiss Army knife for developers. It combines all the tools you need‚Äîa code editor, debugger, and compiler‚Äîinto one user-friendly platform. QubeQode takes this concept and turbocharges it with blockchain-specific features. What sets QubeQode apart is its focus on usability. Traditional blockchain development can be intimidating, even for seasoned coders. QubeQode simplifies the process by offering pre-built templates, drag-and-drop functionality, and real-time testing environments. It‚Äôs designed to eliminate the usual headaches of blockchain programming, making it a perfect fit for both beginners and experts. The IDE operates seamlessly across multiple blockchains, allowing developers to create interoperable apps without needing to master multiple coding languages. It‚Äôs like having a universal translator for blockchain development. This kind of innovation doesn‚Äôt just make life easier; it sets the stage for the next wave of decentralised applications. Conclusion: Join the Future with Qubetics As December 2024 unfolds, the crypto market is offering a mix of challenges and opportunities. Bitcoin and SUI have their merits, but they‚Äôre also grappling with obstacles that make them less appealing for immediate investment. In contrast, Qubetics is a shining example of how innovation and utility can drive success even in tough market conditions. If you‚Äôre searching for the top cryptos to join in December 2024 , Qubetics stands out as a clear winner. Its presale is in full swing, with tokens priced at just $0.0377. Don‚Äôt wait until the weekend when prices jump by 10%. Visit Qubetics Presale today and secure your stake in the future of blockchain.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Rexas Finance leads the charge in real-world asset tokenization, alongside Shiba Inu, Binance Coin, and Tron, as altcoins poised for exponential growth in the next Bitcoin rally. Table of Contents Rexas Finance: The future of tokenized real-world assets Shiba Inu: Beyond the meme coin Binance Coin: The multi-purpose powerhouse Tron: D-club is a decentralized internet contender Conclusion As the next potential Bitcoin rally draws closer, several altcoins display massive potential for exponential growth. Rexas Finance is unique for its tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs), a novel paradigm set to reshape the investment space. Rexas Finance: The future of tokenized real-world assets Rexas Finance is tokenizing real-world assets such as real estate and fine art on the blockchain. This facilitates it for a simple and medium investor, who can just invest in digital tokens representing the physical assets. Tokenization addresses traditional market challenges such as increased liquidity, streamlined processes, and reduced barriers to entry. This strong market potential and investor confidence in Rexas Finance are evident in the recent presale success. In the presale stages, RXS tokens were raised from a price of $0.030 in stage 1 and appreciated to $0.150 in stage 10, amounting to $28m. With a token launch price of $0.20, Presale investors are guaranteed to double their initial investment, yet another proof that CDT2 is very profitable. On Amazon, Rexas Finance‚Äôs longer-term vision is to simplify the buying, selling, and trading of tokenized assets, making transactions safe and transparent. If successful, this innovation could revolutionize real estate and commodity trading sectors and make Rexas Finance a blockchain application trailblazer. As the demand for tokenization keeps increasing, RXS tokens are one of the top choices for substantial returns. Shiba Inu: Beyond the meme coin Initially launched as a playful rival to Dogecoin, Shiba Inu has since blossomed into an Ethereum-based project today that provides robust real-world applications. It comes with its utility for ShibaSwap, which provides decentralized token trading only and upcoming platforms for NFT and governance. The SHIB features make it a valuable asset, swimming in popularity at various times and suitable for future market growth. On the other hand, SHIB‚Äôs deflationary supply model and strong community support make the coin more attractive. As a well-known cryptocurrency with a history of being a market-resilient cryptocurrency, SHIB could profit from the next rally of Bitcoin. Binance Coin: The multi-purpose powerhouse Binance coin is the backbone of the Binance ecosystem. It offers payment integrations, BNB can be used for trading discounts, DeFi functionalities, etc. Its worth exists through fee collection in transactions and participation in BSC governance. All this has been driven by BNB‚Äôs deflationary token burn mechanism, which offers scarcity. With the widespread adoption and use cases, BNB is still a go-to altcoin for investors. Tron: D-club is a decentralized internet contender Tron is competing with stablecoin transfers like USDT on the back of creating another decentralized internet. Strong growth potential is indicated by its ability to double its all-time high in short periods. Tron‚Äôs recent performance also shows its importance in the crypto space. For investors searching for high-growth assets, TRX is a solid option. Conclusion Of these altcoins, however, Rexas Finance is the first to bring a transformational force to asset tokenization and blockchain adoption. Its achievements in presale and vision to break into a more traditional market illustrate a tremendous growth path. Rexas Finance, ahead of another surge for Bitcoin, will allow investors to optimize their returns on this groundbreaking technology as early adopters. https://twitter.com/rexasfinance/status/1871307028498685992 To learn more about RXS, visit the official website , read the whitepaper , and join the community on X and Telegram .

Musk the Manipulator (MUSKMANI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKMANI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk the Manipulator can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk the Manipulator could become the next viral memecoin. Musk the Manipulator launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk the Manipulator on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk the Manipulator by entering its contract address ‚Äì DZpfk5LaLrnP6vSFJnLSMAopUuTJGiFk7543rQxh4ids ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

Drawing on historical data, Kesmeci suggested: Bitcoin Price Target : A potential drop of 23.94% to around $82,220 . Binance Open Interest : A possible decline of 21.88% , taking OI from the current $12.5 billion to $9.77 billion . Key Insights from Historical Patterns Open Interest as a Leading Indicator : Historically, spikes in Binance‚Äôs OI have preceded market corrections. A cooling off in OI typically indicates the unwinding of leveraged positions, resetting the market for the next leg up. Bitcoin‚Äôs Price Corrections : Similar patterns of BTC price corrections have been observed during periods of overheated OI. Kesmeci believes that a 23.94% pullback would align with these historical trends, setting the stage for subsequent recovery. Market Context Current Levels : Bitcoin trades near its recent highs, raising concerns about a potential overbought market. Binance‚Äôs current OI stands at $12.5 billion , which is notably elevated compared to historical averages. Triggers for a Correction : Increased leveraged trading on Binance and other platforms. Broader macroeconomic uncertainties or profit-taking by large holders. Implications for Investors Prepare for Volatility : If the market aligns with Kesmeci‚Äôs prediction, investors may face short-term turbulence. Opportunity to Accumulate : A dip to $82,220 could present a buying opportunity for long-term investors seeking to capitalize on market resets. Watch for Key Indicators : Monitor Binance‚Äôs OI levels and BTC‚Äôs price action closely for signs of stabilization. Conclusion Kesmeci‚Äôs analysis highlights the importance of understanding market dynamics, particularly the relationship between open interest and price movements. While a potential drop to $82,220 may cause concern, it could serve as a reset point, paving the way for a healthier recovery phase.

38056307,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=114114,1735056341,Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index Decline Signals Reduced U.S. Investor Interest,"Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index Decline Signals Reduced U.S. Investor Interest The Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index , a key metric comparing the price difference of Bitcoin on Coinbase and Binance, has dropped to -0.221% , according to CryptoQuant contributor MAC_D . This suggests diminished buying interest from U.S. investors relative to international traders on Binance. Historically, similar drops in the index have been temporary, often encouraging new buyers to capitalize on perceived value opportunities. Key Observations: Understanding the Index : A positive premium indicates stronger buying demand from U.S. investors, often considered more institutionally driven. A negative premium , as seen now, points to relatively weaker demand or higher selling pressure from Coinbase users. Current Market Sentiment : The drop in the Coinbase Premium Index reflects decreased enthusiasm from U.S. investors, potentially due to macroeconomic uncertainty or profit-taking at recent highs. Binance‚Äôs dominance in global trading may indicate that demand remains robust outside the U.S. Historical Context : Temporary Reductions : During past bull markets, negative or diminished Coinbase premiums have often been short-lived. These periods have typically enticed new buyers, seeing it as an opportunity to enter the market at slightly discounted prices. Institutional Role : Coinbase is a favorite among institutional investors, meaning changes in its premium index can reflect shifts in their activity. A negative index could suggest caution or a pause in aggressive accumulation by these players. Implications for Bitcoin‚Äôs Price : Potential for Recovery : If historical patterns hold, diminished U.S. buying interest may stabilize as new buyers step in. A rebound in the Coinbase Premium Index could align with broader bullish sentiment. Global Demand Remains Strong : The activity on Binance indicates sustained interest from international markets, possibly mitigating the impact of reduced U.S. demand. What to Watch: Premium Index Movements : A sustained negative premium might signal broader market caution. A swift recovery could reaffirm the strength of institutional and U.S. investor interest. Macroeconomic Factors : Changes in U.S. regulatory sentiment or market conditions could influence the index and overall buying behavior. Conclusion : While the drop in the Coinbase Premium Index may suggest reduced U.S. buying pressure, historical trends indicate that this could present an opportunity for new market entrants.

The article cites Arthur Herman , a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute , who described quantum computing as a ‚Äú time bomb waiting to explode ‚Äù for blockchain technology. Key Points from the WSJ Analysis: Bitcoin‚Äôs Cryptographic Vulnerability : Bitcoin relies on Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) to secure transactions and wallets. Quantum computers, unlike classical computers, could theoretically solve ECDSA‚Äôs cryptographic challenges exponentially faster, exposing private keys linked to public addresses. Quantum Computing Capabilities : While today‚Äôs quantum computers are not yet powerful enough to break Bitcoin‚Äôs encryption, advancements in quantum hardware and algorithms could change that within the next decade. Estimates suggest that a fully functional quantum computer capable of this would need approximately 1,500 logical qubits ‚Äîa capability still out of reach but actively pursued. Wider Blockchain Industry Impact : Bitcoin is not the only cryptocurrency at risk; many blockchain projects depend on similar cryptographic techniques. The advent of quantum computing could compromise smart contracts, decentralized finance (DeFi), and other cryptographic applications . Mitigation Strategies in Development: Quantum-Resistant Cryptography : Developers and researchers are working on post-quantum cryptography , creating algorithms immune to quantum attacks. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is spearheading efforts to standardize quantum-resistant algorithms by 2024 . Transition to Quantum-Safe Protocols : Blockchain networks could transition to quantum-safe cryptographic protocols, but such upgrades would require extensive community consensus and technical integration. Multisig and Time-Locking Solutions : Enhancing security via multi-signature wallets and time-lock contracts may offer short-term solutions to mitigate quantum threats. Timeline and Concerns: While quantum computing capable of breaching Bitcoin‚Äôs security is not expected to arrive imminently, experts suggest the 2030s as a possible time frame. The article underscores the importance of proactive measures to ensure the long-term security of blockchain systems. Conclusion: The rise of quantum computing represents a double-edged sword for technology, offering groundbreaking advancements while posing significant risks to cryptographic systems. While Bitcoin and blockchain networks remain secure for now, the industry must act decisively to implement quantum-resistant technologies to safeguard the future of decentralized finance and digital assets.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Solaxy gains momentum with a $4.5m presale, targeting Solana‚Äôs scalability issues with its smart Layer 2 solution and massive staking rewards. Table of Contents Solaxy presale outperforms similar projects as it gains momentum Solaxy aims to resolve the issues Solana‚Äôs users face Bolstered by robust investor security, Solaxy‚Äôs community sees rapid growth Solaxy (SOLX) is developing a Layer 2 solution to enhance the user experience on Solana, and investors are taking notice. Less than two weeks have passed since the presale started, and the project‚Äôs funds are just $419,000 away from the $5 million mark. Since the project is still in its early stages, investors have a chance to secure their share of SOLX at a low price and benefit from a massive staking APY to maximize their investment. Let‚Äôs take a closer look at this project and what it‚Äôs all about. Solaxy presale outperforms similar projects as it gains momentum The Solaxy presale officially opened its doors to early investors on December 12th, and it has already raised over $4.5 million. While the project‚Äôs scope plays its part in attracting investors, Solaxy is featured on Best Wallet‚Äôs Upcoming Tokens section, making it available to the app‚Äôs 100,000+ monthly users and boosting its visibility further. This makes it very similar to Pepe Unchained (PEPU), an Ethereum-based Layer 2 blockchain project that successfully ended its presale phase with over $73 million raised. Once its presale ended, PEPU launched on Uniswap and soared by more than 600% in the first 48 hours, securing listings on LBank, BingX, MEXC, and other exchanges as its price rose. Comparing the early success of these two presales puts Solaxy ahead, as Pepe Unchained took more than a month to raise $4.5 million. To enter the presale, investors can purchase SOLX using BNB, ETH, USDT, or a bank card. No minimum investment is required. Currently, SOLX costs $0.001576 each, but its per-token price will increase in just one day or if the presale raises another $273,000 by tomorrow. If Solaxy keeps its momentum, it could surpass PEPU‚Äôs success and potentially deliver better returns on launch. Solaxy aims to resolve the issues Solana‚Äôs users face Solana is among the top three blockchains by transaction volumes, and its daily transaction count has only increased with pump.fun‚Äôs launch. As such, its ecosystem is prone to network overloads and congestion that can result in failed transactions or slow transaction speeds. Solaxy intends to resolve these issues with its Layer 2 blockchain, which will reduce the burden on Solana‚Äôs Layer 1 chain by bundling up and processing transactions in its stead. This won‚Äôt just make Solana more scalable but also more cost-effective for its users. Plus, the bundled transactions will still be finalized on Solana‚Äôs network, leveraging its robust security. The development of the Solaxy Layer 2 blockchain is in full swing, fueled by 30% of the project‚Äôs total 138 billion token supply. Crypto analyst ClayBro has reminded his 134,000-strong audience on YouTube of the congestion issues Solana users faced in March, April, and June of 2024 during meme coin booms. As he anticipates a meme coin supercycle, ClayBro is impressed by Solaxy‚Äôs goal to improve Solana‚Äôs performance and advises his followers to enter the presale while it‚Äôs in its early stages. Bolstered by robust investor security, Solaxy‚Äôs community sees rapid growth Despite Solaxy‚Äôs ambitious goals and the utility of its upcoming Layer 2 blockchain, it‚Äôs a meme coin first, and as such, its success largely depends on the strength and trust of its community. The project‚Äôs 4-phase roadmap reveals it has a strong focus on community building. Its first phase prioritizes marketing, for which the project allocated 15% of its total token supply, and that has already attracted over 22,000 followers across Solaxy‚Äôs X (Twitter) and Telegram channels. The presale also adopts a dynamic model for staking rewards to encourage early adoption. As more SOLX gets added to the staking pool, the staking yields reduce, which rewards early participants with the best returns. Currently, the project offers an 859% staking APY, allowing investors to nearly 9x their token holdings long-term. Solaxy‚Äôs developers also emphasize investor security, with 10% of the total token supply reserved for liquidity to ensure a safe trading environment. Plus, Coinbase , a security firm, audited the project‚Äôs smart contract and found no issues in its code. Although volatility is as high as ever in the meme coin space, Solaxy stands a solid chance to explode following its DEX launch and the subsequent release of its Layer 2 blockchain.

38056043,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=666710,1735056027,XRP Price Prediction: Wave 2 And 5 Targets Put XRP At $7 And $13,"A crypto analyst has set an ambitious target between $7 and $13 for the XRP price, basing his predictions on the Elliott Wave theory and Fibonacci levels. According to the analyst‚Äôs price chart, Wave 2 and 5 could push XRP to these key targets, marking new all-time highs for the cryptocurrency. XRP Price Roadmap To New ATHs The XRP price has been on a rather lengthy consolidation trend, halting its previous price momentum after hitting the $2.5 mark. Despite facing bearish trends and a drop to $2.2, a crypto analyst on TradingView, ‚ÄòZerpcrypto,‚Äô has shared a bullish forecast for the popular altcoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Flashes Major Buy Signal On The 4-Hour TD Sequential Chart, Where To Enter? According to the analyst, XRP could experience a significant price increase between $7.4 to $13.5. The analyst based his bullish projections on XRP‚Äôs recent price action and the Elliott Wave theory, a technical analysis tool that identifies predictable patterns in crypto prices and helps forecast market trends. Zerpcrypto shared a 2-year XRP price chart from 2014 to the present; labeling wave counts from one to five for the larger cycles and sub-waves within these cycles. The analyst‚Äôs chart indicates that XRP is currently in the middle of Wave 3, signaling a potential upward move. With Wave 2 already complete, Zerpcrypto anticipates that Wave 3 could trigger a strong price rally, potentially propelling XRP to $7.4. After reaching the Wave 3 target, a minor pullback is expected in Wave 4, allowing the market to consolidate before XRP‚Äôs final big push upward into Wave 5. In this last wave, XRP could rise to $13.5 and potentially even surge as high as $27.4. In addition to the Elliott Wave theory, Zerpcrypto‚Äòs predictions are grounded in Fibonacci levels. The projected $7.4 and $13.5 XRP price targets align with the 4.236 and 8.618 Fibonacci extension levels respectively, reinforcing the analyst‚Äôs bullish outlook. Zerpcrypto has also spotlighted a positive Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) for XRP, further strengthening his confidence in the cryptocurrency‚Äôs projected $7.4 to $13.5 price target. Crypto Whales Buy 40 Million XRP Despite XRP‚Äôs price drop to $2.25, a 13% decline over the past week, whales continue accumulating large amounts of tokens, viewing the price dips as a potential buying opportunity. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed in a recent X (former Twitter) post that whales have bought another 40 million XRP in the last 24 hours. Related Reading: XRP Price On Its Way To $10 In Only 3 Months If It Follows This Pattern A crypto community member has speculated that this large-scale purchase could signal that whales may be positioning themselves for significant change in XRP. Typically, a surge in whale buying activity often suggests increased confidence in the bullish outlook of a cryptocurrency. With XRP‚Äôs price surging over 4X from its previous low of $0.5 to surpass $2.2 in just two months, analysts are forecasting continued gains as the bull market gains momentum.

38056018,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=114123,1735055987,U.S. IRS Declares Cryptocurrency Staking Income as Taxable,"U.S. IRS Declares Cryptocurrency Staking Income as Taxable The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has officially clarified that income earned through cryptocurrency staking is subject to taxation , according to a report from Watcher Guru. This announcement highlights the growing attention regulators are placing on digital assets and their associated activities. Key Points: What is Cryptocurrency Staking? Staking involves locking up cryptocurrency in a blockchain network to support its operations, such as validating transactions. In return, participants earn rewards in the form of additional cryptocurrency. Taxable Events in Staking: The IRS classifies staking rewards as ordinary income at the time they are received. The value of the staking rewards must be reported in U.S. dollars , calculated based on the fair market value at the time of receipt. This applies regardless of whether the staking rewards are immediately withdrawn or left in the wallet. Impact on Taxpayers: Staking participants are required to include their staking rewards in their gross income during the taxable year they were earned. In addition to income tax, taxpayers may also owe capital gains taxes if they sell or exchange the staked cryptocurrency for a profit at a later date. IRS Guidance and Enforcement: The IRS has been increasing its efforts to regulate and enforce cryptocurrency-related tax compliance. It previously issued guidance for crypto mining and trading activities and now extends its focus to staking. Non-compliance could result in penalties or audits. Implications for Staking Participants: Record-Keeping : Stakers must maintain detailed records of their staking rewards, including the date received and the fair market value at the time of receipt. Tax Planning : Investors should consider the tax implications of staking when determining their overall crypto investment strategies. Potential Complexity : Taxation on staking rewards may add complexity for individuals unfamiliar with crypto tax laws, necessitating professional tax advice. Conclusion: The IRS‚Äôs stance on staking highlights the importance of compliance for cryptocurrency investors. As the digital asset space continues to grow, regulators are expected to provide further clarity and guidelines on other crypto-related activities. Investors engaging in staking must ensure proper documentation and timely reporting to avoid potential legal issues.

According to analytics firm Santiment , this behavior has opened the door for whales and sharks ‚Äîlarge holders of cryptocurrency‚Äîto accumulate more assets at favorable prices, potentially paving the way for future market bounces. Key Highlights: Market Corrections Trigger Panic Selling: Recent price retracements have led to heightened fear among retail traders , particularly those who are less familiar with the typical volatility of crypto markets. Santiment noted an uptick in smaller investors exiting their positions as the correction deepened. Whales and Sharks Accumulate: Larger investors appear to be taking advantage of the sell-off to amass Bitcoin and Ethereum . Historically, such accumulation phases by whales often precede a market rebound , as these entities are known to exert significant influence on price trends. On-Chain Data Signals: Santiment‚Äôs on-chain metrics indicate increased activity from wallets holding large amounts of BTC and ETH. The ‚Äúbuying the dip‚Äù strategy by these players could help stabilize the market and drive future upward momentum. Opportunities in Volatility: For experienced investors, market corrections present an opportunity to buy assets at lower prices. However, newer traders may perceive the declines as signs of further losses, leading to fear-driven decisions. Potential Implications: Short-Term Volatility : Continued selling pressure from retail traders may lead to more volatility in the short term. Price Recovery : Accumulation by whales and other large holders could set the stage for a market recovery , particularly if institutional interest remains strong. Lessons for Retail Traders : Newer market participants are encouraged to study historical market trends to avoid reacting emotionally to typical corrections. Conclusion: The current market correction highlights a classic dynamic between retail traders and institutional or large-scale investors. While panic selling creates short-term challenges, it also opens up opportunities for seasoned players to position themselves advantageously for the next market upswing.

38055952,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=114129,1735055749,Analysis: Investment Advisors Expected to Dominate Crypto ETFs by 2025,"Analysis: Investment Advisors Expected to Dominate Crypto ETFs by 2025 A recent analysis by CF Benchmarks , a leading cryptocurrency benchmark index provider, predicts that investment advisors will surpass hedge funds as the largest holders of spot Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in 2025. This anticipated shift signals growing mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency products within the broader investment management sector. Key Findings: Current ETF Holdings by Sector : Spot Bitcoin ETFs : Hedge Funds: 45.3% of total holdings. Investment Advisors: 28%. Spot Ethereum ETFs : Investment Advisors: 33%, already exceeding hedge fund holdings. Projected Shift in 2025 : Investment advisors are poised to become the largest holders of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. This trend reflects increasing demand from retail and institutional clients seeking diversified crypto exposure through professionally managed funds. Drivers of Growth Among Investment Advisors : Regulatory Clarity : As regulatory frameworks around crypto ETFs solidify, advisors are more comfortable including these assets in client portfolios. Growing Client Demand : Rising interest in cryptocurrencies among retail investors and high-net-worth individuals is pushing advisors to seek efficient and secure exposure methods. Risk-Adjusted Returns : Crypto ETFs offer a simplified, low-risk avenue for investors to gain exposure without directly managing wallets or dealing with exchanges. Hedge Funds to Remain Significant Players : While hedge funds are expected to lose their dominant position, they will continue to account for a large share of crypto ETF holdings due to their active trading strategies and high appetite for speculative investments. What This Means for the Crypto Market : Increased Liquidity : A greater presence of investment advisors in crypto ETFs is likely to boost market liquidity , stabilizing prices and reducing volatility over time. Mainstream Adoption : This shift underscores cryptocurrency‚Äôs growing legitimacy as a recognized asset class within traditional finance. Potential Regulatory Tailwinds : As investment advisors embrace crypto ETFs, they may exert influence on policymakers to create more crypto-friendly regulations. Conclusion: The rise of investment advisors as the largest holders of crypto ETFs by 2025 marks a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency market. It highlights a transition from speculative adoption by hedge funds to broader acceptance among mainstream financial professionals, potentially signaling the maturation of the crypto ecosystem .

38056301,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=632860,1735055718,"Crypto ETFs in 2025: What‚Äôs to come for Solana, XRP, DOGE, Hedera, and Cardano?","The year 2024 marked a historic milestone for the cryptocurrency ecosystem. It witnessed the approval of the first Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), signaling a seismic shift in institutional adoption. If January‚Äôs approval rate is anything to go by, coupled with the current US political stance on digital assets, Crypto ETFs are poised for a transformative 2025. Since spot crypto ETFs were approved, the investment vehicles have garnered more than 5% of Bitcoin‚Äôs total supply, a figure surpassing even the estimated 1.1 million BTC associated with Bitcoin‚Äôs enigmatic creator, Satoshi Nakamoto . Since January, the story of the crypto ETFs has been one of continued market maturation. The launch of Bitcoin ETFs in January, followed by Ethereum ETFs in July, has set the stage for a more diversified crypto ETF landscape in 2025. Analysts predict a wave of new ETF offerings for top crypto protocols, including Solana, XRP, Litecoin (LTC), Hedera (HBAR), and others. The changing regulatory environment also plays a critical role. With the departure of SEC Chair Gary Gensler, a figure known for his ‚Äúunfair‚Äù stance on crypto assets, and the nomination of pro-crypto Paul Atkins by President-elect Donald Trump , the outlook for crypto ETFs in 2025 appears significantly brighter. A lighter regulatory approach could pave the way for broader approval of ETFs linked to various cryptocurrencies, further integrating digital assets into mainstream financial markets. Spotlight on Solana ETFs Solana, a high-performance blockchain with a robust ecosystem spanning decentralized finance, NFTs, and gaming, is a prime candidate for ETF inclusion. In December, the SEC rejected applications for spot Solana ETFs from several issuers, citing regulatory hurdles . üö®SCOOP: I‚Äôve confirmed that the @SECGov has notified at least two of the five prospective issuers that it will reject their 19b4 filings for the $SOL spot ETFs. The consensus here, I‚Äôm told, is that the SEC won‚Äôt entertain any new #crypto ETFs under the current administration. ‚Äî Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) December 6, 2024 Despite this, optimism remains high for 2025, especially following Trump‚Äôs electoral win and the anticipated regulatory shift under Paul Atkins. Major asset management firms like VanEck, 21Shares, and Canary Capital have filed for Solana ETFs, with applications gaining traction post-election. ‚Äú It appears the SEC is now engaging with issuers on this product, which is obviously a positive sign ,‚Äù noted Nate Geraci. Industry insiders believe Solana‚Äôs success, alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, will set a precedent for its approval by the end of 2025. However, analysts from JPMorgan caution that pending lawsuits regarding unregistered securities could delay Solana‚Äôs ETF timeline. XRP: Legal clarity could build ETF approval potential Ripple‚Äôs XRP has long been at the center of regulatory battles, with the SEC‚Äôs lawsuit against Ripple Labs serving as a touchstone for broader crypto regulation. Despite this, analysts believe XRP ETFs are on the horizon, contingent on the resolution of its legal disputes. WisdomTree, Bitwise, and Canary Capital have already filed for XRP ETFs, signaling growing institutional interest in the asset. Bloomberg‚Äôs James Seyffart suggests that while Litecoin and Hedera ETFs might gain approval sooner, XRP‚Äôs potential ETF launch will attract significant investor attention. With its ongoing legal challenges nearing a curtain draw, XRP is poised to reenter the spotlight, bolstered by ETF filings and growing market demand. Dogecoin and Hedera ETFs: Speculation meets reality Dogecoin‚Äôs journey to ETF consideration, much like its whole crypto market journey, has been full of humor and speculation. The memecoin has won the hearts of netizens, and as funny as this sounds, inspired the naming of an Elon Musk-led unofficial US government office named the Department of Government Efficiency, acronymed as the coin itself, D.O.G.E. I still can‚Äôt believe @DOGE is real ü§£ü§£ ‚Äî Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 25, 2024 Eric Balchunas had humorously hinted at the possibility of a Dogecoin ETF, but industry observers note that the concentrated holdings of DOGE present challenges for fair market assessments. Nevertheless, the more permissive regulatory stance anticipated in 2025 may open doors for DOGE-focused products. Hedera, by contrast, stands on firmer ground. Its native token, HBAR, has not been classified as a security, giving it a regulatory edge. That said, only Canary Capital has made an application for a Hedera ETF. Bloomberg analysts suggest Hedera is among the most likely candidates to secure ETF approval among the likes of XRP, DOGE and ADA. Cardano ETFs: A rising contender Cardano (ADA) saw a surge in interest following its inclusion in Bitwise‚Äôs 10 Crypto Index Fund ETF application. The announcement triggered a seven-month high in ADA trading volume, alongside increased whale activity. ETF expert Geraci also predicts that Cardano could join the US spot ETF market as soon as Solana and XRP get approved, further cementing its position as a top-tier cryptocurrency. Crypto Capital Venture founder Dan Gambardello believes Cardano‚Äôs ecosystem developments and potential ETF approval could propel its price significantly. While regulatory clarity remains a prerequisite, Cardano‚Äôs growing institutional appeal positions it as a strong contender for ETF approval in 2025. 2025 is the year for crypto ETFs As the crypto industry enters 2025, the rise of ETFs signals a new era of growth and maturity. Bitcoin is slowly solidifying its role as a global reserve asset, which is forcing watchdogs to clear the air on regulatory frameworks. It‚Äôs only a matter of time before the stage is set for widespread adoption. The exponential growth of DeFi, stablecoins, and crypto ETFs highlights the transformative potential of digital assets in global finance. Supported by a more crypto-friendly administration, the industry is poised to render boundaries obsolete, which is why we believe 2025 could be the year for Crypto ETFs.

Outflows in Select Assets : Solana (SOL) faced $8.7 million in outflows , indicating waning investor sentiment. Multi-asset products experienced significant outflows of $121 million , hinting at a shift toward single-asset investments.

Altcoins Under Pressure : Outflows from Solana and multi-asset products suggest that investors are consolidating positions into more established assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

38055780,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=114137,1735055450,Elon Musk recently sparked speculation,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently sparked speculation by suggesting via X that U.S. President Joe Biden might issue a preemptive pardon for Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) , the disgraced founder of FTX. Musk claimed, ‚ÄúI will be shocked if this doesn‚Äôt happen,‚Äù referencing SBF‚Äôs status as a major donor to Democratic campaigns. Key Details: SBF‚Äôs Conviction : SBF is currently serving a 25-year sentence at the Brooklyn Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) for multiple fraud-related charges stemming from the collapse of his crypto exchange, FTX . His attempt to appeal his conviction on the grounds of judicial bias was recently rejected by U.S. authorities. Political Contributions : SBF donated $5.2 million to Biden‚Äôs 2020 presidential campaign and over $40 million to Democratic candidates during the U.S. midterm elections. In response to public outcry, three major Democratic organizations announced plans to return $1 million (2.2%) of the contributions. Musk‚Äôs Speculation : Musk‚Äôs comment aligns with growing scrutiny of SBF‚Äôs political connections, particularly his financial ties to influential Democratic figures. Public Reactions: Skepticism and Criticism : Musk‚Äôs statement has reignited debates over political corruption and the ethical implications of campaign donations influencing legal decisions. Calls for Accountability : Many in the crypto community have emphasized the need for transparency and justice , urging that SBF‚Äôs political affiliations should not shield him from the consequences of his actions. Implications: If Biden were to pardon SBF, it could have significant repercussions: Political Fallout : Critics argue it would raise questions about favoritism and accountability within the justice system. Crypto Industry Sentiment : Such a move could further erode trust in the regulatory environment surrounding cryptocurrencies. Conclusion: While Musk‚Äôs statement is speculative, it underscores lingering concerns about the intersection of politics and justice.

This shift is attributed to market corrections, particularly in the market caps of altcoins , as well as decreased interest in memecoins and an uptick in focus on Bitcoin . Key Insights: Market Correction Impact : Altcoins and memecoins have faced significant price retracements, reducing speculative interest. The broader market correction has triggered fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) among retail investors. Bitcoin Dominance : While altcoins have struggled, Bitcoin has seen increased attention, often regarded as a safer asset during market uncertainty. Bitcoin‚Äôs relatively stable performance during corrections has highlighted its status as a market anchor. Cycle Dynamics : Santiment emphasized that such FUD is a natural and healthy part of the cryptocurrency market cycle. These phases can provide opportunities for patient traders to position themselves for the next market rebound. Implications for Traders: Short-Term Outlook : Bearish sentiment might dominate the market for now, with further corrections possible for riskier altcoins . Opportunity for Accumulation : For disciplined investors, the current bearish phase could present buying opportunities in strong projects at discounted prices. Focus on Fundamentals : During periods of market uncertainty, assets with strong fundamentals, like Bitcoin and Ethereum , tend to outperform speculative plays.

Furthermore, the latest trend is, at press time, one of recovery as BTC‚Äôs valuation is substantially above the 7-day lows close to $1.83 trillion. Additionally, either a ‚ÄòSanta Claus‚Äô or an early 2025 rally appears in the cards, despite crypto market ‚ÄòGrinch‚Äô seemingly stealing the hoped-for year‚Äôs end parabolic surge, as Bitcoin‚Äôs recent drop was dictated by external factors. The world‚Äôs premier cryptocurrency fell victim to the latest Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announcement that simultaneously ‚Äì and temporarily ‚Äì wiped $1.5 trillion from the U.S. stock market as investors again began fearing higher inflation and higher interest rates in the new year. Bitcoin price prediction for 2025 Looking ahead to 2025, the most recent expert forecasts paint a bullish picture for the upcoming year. For example, the prominent Wall Street analyst Tom Lee estimated that $250,000 is a plausible 12-month price target for Bitcoin. Robert Kiyosaki , a prominent and persistent BTC bull, set his sights for the new year at $350,000, while Perianne Boring, a cryptocurrency lobbyist, revealed that $800,000 is plausible according to some models. In the more immediate future, prior analysis conducted by the on-chain analyst Ali Martinez indicates that having rebounded well above $95,000, Bitcoin is safe from a greater drop but that it could face substantial resistance at $125,000 and $150,000. Martinez is also somewhat less bullish than Kiyosaki or Tom Lee, as he estimated BTC will top near $220,000 in the current cycle.

38055419,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=632826,1735054768,"Meme coins are 2024‚Äôs most popular crypto narrative, capturing 31% of global investor interest","In 2024, the crypto space has been awash with talk about meme coins, making them the most popular crypto narrative. The tokens inspired by trendy internet captions captured 31% of investors‚Äô interest globally across the main meme coin narrative and 25 meme coin trends. This percentage means that nearly a third of crypto narrative interest was based on speculative opportunities with fundamentals. The market grew from dog-related meme coins such as Dogecoin to other animal and personality-related meme coins. The success of meme coins was spurred by the launch pool, Pump.fun. Solana alone deployed almost 5 million new meme coins in 2024, leading to over $335 million in fees . Meme coins claimed the top spot in crypto narratives, with the leading tokens making up 14.36% of investor interest. Other meme coin trends also gained traction, including Solana-based meme coins (7.65%), Base meme coins (2.13%), AI meme coins (1.49%), and cat-themed meme coins (1.19%). As a result, meme coins were the third most rewarding narrative of the year, delivering an average annual profit of 201%. AI tokens shine in 2024, but meme coins outpace them The year 2024 saw the growth of artificial intelligence (AI) in the crypto space. There was curiosity and investor expectations in exploring the intersection between AI and blockchain. AI was a hot topic within the crypto space, capturing 15.67% of the mindshare across six narratives. The AI narrative came second with a 12.58% share of investor interest, which means it grew by 1.26% from last year when it had an 11.32% share of interest. AI-related trends, including AI meme coins (1.49%) and AI agents (1.17%), made the technology more popular around crypto. Yet, it couldn‚Äôt match the meteoric rise of the meme coin narrative, which outdid it by far. Analysts state that AI tokens had a dismal performance, with a 2024 yearly negative performance of 11.6% due to Worldcoin‚Äôs WLD 39% drawdown. Meme coins have evolved from an internet fad to a $117 billion market powerhouse Many people see meme coins as an internet joke, noting that they lack the technological innovation or utility of Bitcoin or Ethereum. Their value relies on community interest rather than their inner value or groundbreaking use case, making them highly volatile and unreliable. Yet Binance statistics reveal immense growth in interest in meme coins. More people believe that their reputation is beyond a joke and that they have a potential drive for future market growth. Meme coins have a combined market cap of $117 billion, indicating how they have captured attention and grown to dominate the crypto space. At the apex is Dogecoin , an original meme coin that is considered the ‚ÄúKing‚Äù of meme coins.

Adding to the concerns, a recent update regarding Cardano‚Äôs token unlock has sparked fear among traders and investors about a potential price dip. Cardano (ADA) Token Unlock Scheduled Today, December 24, 2024, a crypto insights provider, Tokenomist, posted on X (formerly Twitter) revealing that the Cardano blockchain is set to unlock 18.53 million ADA tokens worth $16.37 million on December 26, 2024.

TokenUnlocks) (@Tokenomist_ai) December 20, 2024 The report further stated that this substantial token unlocks accounts for 0.05% of Cardano‚Äôs total circulating supply. With the recent token unlock, Cardano will have unlocked 85.44% of its maximum ADA supply. ADA Current Price and Potential Impact Based on the data, whenever a project unlocks its respective tokens, it typically creates inflows into exchanges, leading to selling pressure and a subsequent price decline. In the case of ADA, experts and analysts suggest that the token might face a price drop in the coming days. At press time, ADA is trading near $0.93 and has experienced a price surge of over 8% in the past 24 hours. However, during the same period, its trading volume dropped by 5%, suggesting that traders and investors are still apprehensive about a potential price decline, which might explain the lower participation. Will ADA break $0.98 or dip below $0.85? Read our Cardano pr ice prediction to see what‚Äôs next for this top crypto! Cardano (ADA) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, ADA has been consolidating within a tight range of $0.86 to $0.97 over the past five trading days. The breakout from this consolidation zone could determine whether ADA will rally or decline in the future. Source: Trading View Based on recent price action , if ADA breaks out of the consolidation zone and closes a daily candle above the $0.98 mark, it is highly likely to rally by 25% to reach the $1.25 mark. Conversely, if ADA breaks down from the consolidation zone and closes a daily candle below the $0.85 level, it could decline by 12% to reach the next support level at $0.75. As of now, the sentiment across the cryptocurrency landscape appears to be recovering after notable price declines in recent days. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

38059382,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=106339,1735054360,Mt Gox‚Äôs Bitcoin Transfers to B2C2 Group Exceed $364M: A Closer Look,"Recent analysis has uncovered how bankrupt entity Mt. Gox capitalized on the Bitcoin uptrend since the premier asset surpassed the $100K level this month. Blockchain resource Lookonchain revealed a series of substantial Bitcoin transfers from the Mt. Gox rehabilitation fund to the market maker B2C2 Group. It observed that, since December 5, Mt. Gox has been distributing between 200 and 300 BTC to B2C2 every working day, offloading a total of 3,631.87 BTC.These transactions are worth approximately $364 million and are believed to be part of Mt. Gox's creditor repayment process.Daily Transfer BreakdownThe initial transfers began with 200 BTC per day, valued at $20.5 million and $19.6 million for December 5-6, respectively. However, between December 9-13, a consistent pattern of 300 BTC transfers emerged. The daily values ranged between $28.8 million and $30.2 million.The period between December 16 to 19 saw the largest daily transfers, with transfers worth between $30.1 million and $31.9 million per day. This coincided with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high of $108,300.By December 20, the volume had decreased to 200 BTC, valued at $19.4 million, with a similar value moving on Monday, December 23. The most recent transfers occurred today and saw the movement of 131.87 BTC worth $12.4 million. Purpose and Implications on BTC PriceMarket commentators believe the transfers are to be part of Mt. Gox's creditor repayment strategy. Mt. Gox, the Japanese Bitcoin exchange that collapsed in 2014, announced the commencement of creditor repayments in July 2024. Customers have waited a decade for refunds after Mt. Gox lost up to 950,000 BTC in hacks.The announcement noted that payments would continue for eligible users who complete account verification and sign up with designated exchanges. At the time, the bankruptcy estate held 138,985 BTC, worth $7.5 billion.¬†Meanwhile, the most recent data from Arkham shows it holds 36,085 BTC, valued at approximately $3.47 billion.Essentially, this confirms that the repayment process is progressing , with billions of dollars in Bitcoin already distributed. For instance, in November, the defunct platform dispatched BTC worth approximately $2.2 billion to three external addresses.Analysts had previously warned of the possibility of selling pressure as creditors cash. Yet, they noted that market liquidity could absorb this without major disruption, especially since the total Bitcoin owed represents well below 1% of the total supply, and not all funds will be liquidated at once.Meanwhile, news of Mt. Gox's Bitcoin movement to external wallets has often raised eyebrows in the crypto community.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | ARKM,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/24/mt-goxs-bitcoin-transfers-to-b2c2-group-exceed-364m-a-closer-look/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=mt-goxs-bitcoin-transfers-to-b2c2-group-exceed-364m-a-closer-look,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

He underscored that such matters come under the jurisdiction of Congress and the Fed does not wish to seek a change in existing laws to allow for Bitcoin holdings. Powell‚Äôs statement instantly shook the market, which caused Bitcoin‚Äôs price to quickly pull back from its high earlier in the week. Besides, the probability of a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve dropped from a peak of 40% on the 18th to 34% after Powell‚Äôs speech on the Polymarket platform. WuBlockchain in the latest post has shared insights on whether the Fed could prevent the US from creating a national Bitcoin reserve. Can the Fed Block the BSR plan? The U.S. Congress is the highest authority in the financial system, responsible for enacting regulations and authorizing agencies like the SEC and Federal Reserve to perform their functions. It is important to note that while the Fed enjoys a high degree of independence in monetary policy and national economic stability, it does not have a ‚Äúveto power‚Äù over the decision to establish a BSR. Can Trump Quickly Establish BSR? In order to quickly establish a strategic bitcoin reserve , the Trump administration could issue an executive order requiring the U.S. Treasury to use the Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF) and directly purchase Bitcoin. Notably, the operation of the fund is not controlled by Congress, and the President and Treasury have significant independence in its use. This approach would avoid the need for congressional approval, and reduce political opposition. However, the sustainability of such a BSR is uncertain, as future administrations could revoke or amend the executive order. A Long-term BSR To establish a long-term and stable BSR, a more legal and stable route would be through congressional legislation, incorporating Bitcoin into the ‚Äú Strategic Reserve Act ‚Äù or similar laws. This would formally recognize Bitcoin as a national strategic asset. The ‚ÄúU.S. Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Act,‚Äù suggested by Senator Cynthia Lummis , follows this route which is currently under review by the Senate Banking Committee. However, this approach is more time-consuming and could face hurdles as the bill must pass both the Senate and House of Representatives and be approved by the President. Either way, the Treasury Department, rather than the Fed would ultimately take the lead in implementing the Bitcoin reserve. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Kraken and SEC File Joint Stipulation in Ongoing Discovery Dispute , Is There A Middle Way Out? A middle path could also be pursued by the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department for the Bitcoin allocation. The Federal Reserve could purchase Bitcoin through open market operations and add it to its balance sheet. However, given the Federal Reserve‚Äôs recent statements , this approach seems unlikely. The Treasury Department on the other hand could establish a special fund to invest in Bitcoin as part of a fiscal investment plan, it would require congressional approval. Nevertheless, the Fed‚Äôs ‚Äúno‚Äù does not outrightly reject the proposal for a BSR, and the Trump administration has shown support through action. While the Fed‚Äôs approach remains cautious, the Trump family‚Äôs actions indicate a muted struggle between traditional power and market innovation. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

38055034,https://nulltx.com/?p=136426,1735054283,Safest Crypto Wallet: Plus Wallet Leads; Ledger & DEXX Alert,"DEXX Responds to Security Breach, Plus Wallet Leads in Safety, and Ledger Battles Phishing Scam This week, crypto wallet security has zoomed into the spotlight with emerging threats and the recovery efforts from previous incidents. A fresh phishing scam has erupted, targeting individuals with deceitful emails purportedly from Ledger Wallet, which coax them into disclosing their recovery phrases on a bogus website. At the same time, DEXX has launched a compensation strategy this month after a security breach wiped out over $21 million in Solana assets for its users. In such a volatile environment, Plus Wallet has surged in popularity as the safest crypto wallet, securing private keys on personal devices for ultimate protection. The wallet further enhances user experience with perks like boundless rewards and comprehensive cross-chain support, placing users well ahead in the competitive market. Ledger Wallet Users Beware: Phishing Scam Alert Latest updates from Ledger Wallet have unveiled a phishing plot targeting crypto enthusiasts. These crafty emails, masquerading as official Ledger communications, falsely announce a data breach and implore users to confirm their recovery phrases. Following the links in these emails leads to a counterfeit website designed to mirror Ledger‚Äôs official site, where unsuspecting users are tricked into entering their 24-word recovery phrase. Ledger Wallet has issued urgent advisories to users to safeguard their recovery phrases and avoid sharing them through any remote methods. This alert comes in the wake of a distressing incident where a user lost a staggering $2.5 million in Bitcoin and NFTs without ever online sharing their seed phrase. Key Takeaways from the DEXX Security Breach Just this month, following a devastating security breach in November 2024, DEXX set forth a compensation plan after over $21 million worth of Solana funds evaporated from user accounts. This breach revealed severe lapses in crypto wallet security, primarily the risky practice of storing private keys on central servers. This breach underscores the crucial need for local storage of private keys, ensuring they remain under the user‚Äôs exclusive control, and amplifies the importance of a thorough security check before settling on a crypto wallet. A strong security foundation is essential to ward off such severe breaches. Leading the Pack in Security: How Plus Wallet Stands Out As hacking threats multiply, the need for the safest crypto wallets has soared to unprecedented levels. Users are searching for reliable wallets that not only secure their assets against these threats but also offer the flexibility to partake in diverse crypto activities. Here, Plus Wallet shines brightly. It boasts a comprehensive security system that employs multiple layers of defense, including cutting-edge encryption, to protect users‚Äô data and assets. A standout feature of Plus Wallet is its method of storing private keys directly on the user‚Äôs device, as opposed to server-based storage. This strategy ensures that only the user can access their assets, eliminating any risk of third-party intrusion and giving users complete control over their funds. Additionally, Plus Wallet enhances its security with two-factor authentication options like Face ID and PIN codes. This additional layer of security guarantees that, even if a device is compromised, unauthorized entities cannot gain access. Plus Wallet also simplifies the recovery process for users with lost devices; by simply re-downloading the app and entering their recovery phrase, users can restore access to their assets seamlessly. Beyond these security protocols, Plus Wallet supports multiple blockchain networks, enabling users to manage their assets across various chains. It also offers avenues for passive income through routine trading. Collectively, these features position Plus Wallet as one of the safest crypto wallets available, providing users with both the protection they need and the flexibility they desire to enhance their financial success. Essential Insights The recent phishing scheme posing as Ledger Wallet serves as a stark reminder of the escalating threats faced by cryptocurrency users, underscoring the critical importance of guarding recovery phrases against fraud. Similarly, the breach at DEXX has spotlighted the vital necessity for secure private key storage and a thorough evaluation of a crypto wallet‚Äôs security framework. In this turbulent landscape, Plus Wallet has ascended in stature as one of the safest crypto wallets, prized for its control and adaptability. Its superior encryption safeguards assets against external threats, while the private key storage on personal devices ensures users retain ultimate control and bolstered security. Equipped with a suite of formidable capabilities, Plus Wallet delivers a perfect fusion of safety and convenience, making it an excellent choice for users eager to secure their digital assets while pursuing growth in their crypto endeavors.

The analyst pseudonymously known as CredibleCrypto tells his 449,900 followers on the social media platform X that his ‚Äúhighest conviction‚Äù bet based on the risk-reward ratio is Curve DAO ( CRV ). According to CredibleCrypto, CRV could rally by at least 722% from the current level. CRV is trading at $0.852 at time of writing, up by over 70% over the past 30 days. The widely followed analyst says that his bullish thesis for CRV is backed by the tokenomics of the DeFi altcoin in addition to the technical analysis. ‚ÄúYou have a coin that has an emissions structure that is literally modeled after Bitcoin (BTC), but: ‚Äì has 40+% of the supply essentially locked in perpetuity ‚Äì generates real yield from working products which is paid out to token lockers multiple times a month ‚Äì currently has the highest developer activity + number of developers that have ever worked on the protocol in its history despite the depressed price.‚Äù According to CredibleCrypto, Curve DAO has an advantage over Bitcoin in that unlike BTC, the long-term holders of CRV can‚Äôt dump during the bear markets and worsen the price declines or take profits during the bull markets and curtail price appreciation. ‚Äú‚Ä¶with CRV, token lockers literally can‚Äôt sell into the pumps OR sell into the dumps because their tokens are locked (in most cases) for a minimum of 3.5 ‚Äì 4 years.‚Äù The pseudonymous analyst further says, ‚ÄúOverall, aside from the clean technicals and chart setup, CRV, fundamentally, has all the markings of the next big success in this space that I think most are sleeping on because of either a lack of understanding of the mechanics behind the project or because of regurgitated, out-dated fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) that has been spread about the token during the last market downturn.‚Äù Don't Miss a Beat ‚Äì Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

38055057,https://crypto.news/?p=14321965,1735054253,Polygon meme coin positioned to overtake ADA and DOGE in the race to $10,"Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Polygon-based meme coin XYZ races toward $10, sparking buzz as it eyes surpassing Cardano and Dogecoin in the crypto arena. Table of Contents The all-sports meme token that‚Äôs gaining traction Cardano dips Dogecoin fluctuates Conclusion A meme coin on the Polygon blockchain is making waves with its rapid ascent toward the $10 mark. This token‚Äôs swift rise is stirring discussions about whether it could surpass well-known cryptocurrencies like Cardano and Dogecoin. The factors propelling its growth are capturing the attention of the crypto community. The all-sports meme token that‚Äôs gaining traction Built on the Polygon blockchain, XYZ is poised to leave giants like ADA and DOGE trailing as it charges toward the coveted $10 milestone. Imagine an MVP that pairs the world‚Äôs sporting passion with explosive meme coin energy, welcome to XYZVerse, where degens everywhere can seize the massive upside of this booming market. Picture the frenzy that catapulted Polymarket to $1 billion in trading volume during the US presidential election, then top it off with the electrifying hype of meme coins and the high-stakes thrill of sports betting. With millions of fans ready to hit the virtual field, XYZ is fueling an ecosystem ripe for rapid expansion. It‚Äôs 2024, and meme coins rule the crypto roost. XYZ sets its sights on a staggering 9,900% growth by TGE, promising to blow past the finish line. Forget BOME‚Äôs 5,000% leap or WIF‚Äôs 1,000% rally, XYZ is here to outscore them all. Armed with upcoming CEX/DEX listings, audited smart contracts, and a fully vetted team, XYZ already holds a commanding lead. Embrace the first-mover advantage before the crowd storms the field, and watch returns soar as XYZ accelerates toward the $10 mark. Investors can grab XYZ tokens now . Cardano dips Cardano has experienced notable price swings recently. In the past week, its price fell by 20.80%. Over the last month, it decreased by 14.34%. However, looking back six months, ADA‚Äôs price has surged by 122.45%. This long-term growth suggests strong underlying momentum despite short-term declines. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for ADA is at 42.36, indicating that it is nearing oversold territory. The Stochastic oscillator stands at 13.57, which also points toward potential bullish reversal. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) level is -0.0055, showing bearish momentum but hinting at a possible upcoming shift. With the 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages closely aligned at $0.89 and $0.90 respectively, ADA‚Äôs price is consolidating. If ADA‚Äôs price can overcome the nearest resistance level at $1.28, it could target the second resistance at $1.64. Achieving these levels would represent gains of approximately 48% and 78% from the current price range of $0.72-$1.08. Conversely, if the price dips to the nearest support level at $0.56, it would mark a decrease of about 22%. Traders are watching these levels carefully, as they may signal key opportunities in ADA‚Äôs price movement. Dogecoin fluctuates Dogecoin has seen significant shifts in its price recently. Over the past week, it dropped by 24.51%, and the past month shows a decrease of 25.80%. Despite these declines, DOGE holds a substantial 141.95% increase over the last six months. Currently, it trades between $0.24 and $0.40, reflecting a volatile market stance. Technical indicators present a mixed outlook. The Simple Moving Averages for both 10 and 100 days stand at $0.31, indicating a period of consolidation. The Relative Strength Index is at 41.81, suggesting that the coin is nearing oversold territory. A Stochastic value of 17.76 supports this, pointing to potential upward momentum. However, the MACD level is at -0.002010, which could hint at continued bearish trends. Key price levels are in focus for Dogecoin. The nearest resistance is at $0.48. Approaching this point would mark an increase of around 60% from the lower end of its current range. Beyond that, the second resistance level is at $0.63. On the downside, the nearest support level sits at $0.17. Falling below this could lead to the second support at $0.0252, indicating a significant decrease. These levels are crucial as traders watch for DOGE‚Äôs next move. Conclusion ADA and DOGE are strong, but XYZ, the first all-sport memecoin, aims for 20,000% growth, surpassing tokens like PEPE and MOG with its community-driven, sustainable approach.

Who is the Biggest Candidate? Here Are the Details‚Ä¶","While institutional Bitcoin adoption is on the rise, MicroStrategy is leading the way in terms of institutional adoption. However, this could change in 2025, when more corporate giants are expected to adopt Bitcoin. At this point, according to prediction market data, the probability that one of the world's giant companies, called the magnificent 7 companies, will announce Bitcoin adoption in 2025 has increased significantly. According to data from prediction market platform Kalshi, the probability of at least one ‚ÄúMagnificent 7‚Äù company buying Bitcoin in 2025 has risen to 85 percent. This marks a significant increase from the previous probability of 49 percent. The Fab 7 are the top seven tech companies that have the power to massively influence overall market sentiment. These include Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Tesla. The top five public companies that adopted Bitcoin early and purchased BTC are: MicroStrategy (444,262 BTC), Marathon Digital Holdings (40,435 BTC), Riot Platforms (16,728), Hut 8 Corp (10,096 BTC), and Tesla (9,720 BTC). Among these companies, MicroStrategy is the publicly traded company with the most BTC, while the company's founder Michael Saylor argues that its BTC strategy has enabled it to achieve tremendous growth. At this point, Saylor called on technology giants, especially Microsoft, to invest in Bitcoin. He even made a presentation to the Microsoft board of directors about Bitcoin investment. Related News: Will Microsoft Finally Invest in Bitcoin? Big Bull Michael Saylor Will Explain BTC, Try to Convince! However, Microsoft shareholders rejected the offer to invest in BTC as part of their treasury.

38054905,https://crypto.news/?p=14321922,1735054047,"Nearly 30% of crypto trends focused on meme coins in 2024, survey shows","2024 has seen a dramatic surge in interest in meme coins, with almost a third of investor interest focused on speculative tokens rather than fundamental projects. In 2024, one narrative appeared to dominate the crypto space more than any other: meme coins. These tokens, often deemed as dumb coins made for jokes or community-driven projects, have captured more than 30% of global investor interest, according to the latest survey conducted by crypto price aggregator CoinGecko. Top crypto trends in 2024 | Source: CoinGecko In total, the meme coin narrative claimed 14.36% of global crypto narrative interest in 2024, nearly doubling the figure from the previous year‚Äôs 8.32%. But it‚Äôs not just about the rise of Dogecoin ( DOGE ) anymore; a whole array of animal-themed, personality-driven coins have emerged, too. ‚ÄúAlmost a third of crypto narrative interest this year was focused on more speculative opportunities with less emphasis on fundamentals,‚Äù CoinGecko notes. And it‚Äôs no surprise these assets are so popular among retail traders. In a moment, meme coins even outperformed crypto majors, becoming an easy way to win a digital lottery for ordinary crypto users. The Solana moment One of the brightest examples of the meme coin craze has been the role of Solana , a network that was once on the brink of collapse after the notorious bankruptcy of the FTX crypto exchange. You might also like: Hawk Tuah Hailey Welch sued over $50m meme coin debacle It‚Äôs worth noting that meme coins have been on for a while on Solana, though it is fair to say that they gained huge popularity through platforms like pump.fun, which played a big role in the narrative shift. As a result of that boost, Solana meme coins ranked 4th in investor interest, per CoinGecko‚Äôs rating, holding a 7.65% share of crypto narrative discussions in 2024. Copycat effect But the success of Solana meme coins has not gone unnoticed. Other blockchain networks have tried to replicate Solana‚Äôs approach as well. For instance, Coinbase‚Äôs Base network, launched as a layer-2 solution on the Ethereum blockchain, also saw its own meme coins in 2024. However, it‚Äôs not clear whether these coins captured the same level of interest as their Solana rivals. Base meme coins ranked 11th with a 2.13% share of global crypto narrative interest, which, while respectable, still pales in comparison to Solana‚Äôs 7.65%. While some new projects ‚Äî like the emergence of cat-themed meme coins and AI meme coins ‚Äî have also appeared in the top 20 crypto narratives, the hype surrounding them has yet to reach the heights of Solana‚Äôs meme coin surge. ‚ÄúI see the damage every day‚Äù Despite their popularity, meme coins are not without their critics. For some, they represent a pointless distraction in an otherwise promising technological space. For instance, as crypto.news reported earlier, Eddy Lazzarin, the chief technology officer for a16z crypto, shared his concerns about the negative impact of meme coins on the broader crypto industry. He particularly has compared meme coins to a ‚Äúrisky casino‚Äù rather than a useful product. In a series of X posts, Lazzarin expressed alarm that meme coins are reshaping perceptions of the crypto market in a negative way, noting that this sector ‚Äúat best‚Äù looks like a ‚Äúrisky casino.‚Äù https://twitter.com/eddylazzarin/status/1783179299085856934 Lazzarin believes that the rise of meme coins could have long-term consequences for how the public, regulators, and entrepreneurs view the crypto space. The speculative frenzy surrounding meme coins ‚Äî driven by quick profits rather than innovative technology or real-world applications ‚Äî can mislead new investors and damage the credibility of the crypto industry. In mid-December, for instance, following a warning from the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, pump.fun barred British users from accessing its website. ‚ÄúI see the damage every day,‚Äù Lazzarin warned, adding that while there may be a future for crypto products and protocols that bring real value, the meme coin bubble could set back the space significantly. Casino always wins In many ways, the rise of meme coins in 2024 marks a pivotal moment in the crypto narrative. As blockchain ecosystems like Solana and Base attempt to harness the power of meme coin culture, the market continues to evolve. Whether meme coins continue to dominate the narrative or whether the crypto space returns to its roots remains to be seen. For now, however, the casino is open ‚Äî and many are willing to roll the dice. CoinGecko‚Äôs study examined interest in crypto narratives based on its own categories‚Äô non-botted global web traffic from Jan. 1, 2023, to Dec. 21, this year.

38054952,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=632728,1735053795,Are bots secretly ruining Marvel Rivals?,"Some Marvel Rivals players suspect that the game is adding bots in matches. Online multiplayer games tend to use bots now and then, but fans feel this feature doesn‚Äôt fit in Marvel Rivals. Marvel Rivals is still a new game with a high player count and competitive play. Fans say bots in the game are ruining the experience. Usually, bots in games are made to fill spots when there aren‚Äôt enough players. However, these bots behave awkwardly, which many gamers don‚Äôt appreciate in their experiences. Games like Fortnite regularly add bots in their matches. Most gamers feel it makes the gameplay unrealistic, as these bots are too easy to defeat. Beginners enjoy victories against bots, while others see them as hollow and pointless because these non-human players aren‚Äôt competitive enough to give winners the high they seek. Marvel Rivals grows more popular but f ans complain about bots A Reddit User, nG_Skyz, said that Marvel Rivals‚Äôs bot matches are a waste of time. Some players had not realized the alleged bots and were surprised by the post‚Äôs revelation. Solid-Bed-8974, another commenter, explained why they think bots are in the game. He said after losing two or three rounds in a row, players end up playing a team consisting entirely of bots. These bots are supposedly easy to spot since they‚Äôre all level 1 and have restricted profiles. For new players, this may be great, but it‚Äôs aggravating for competitive gamers. Solid-Bed-8974 also highlighted how bots behave. Bots often abuse their abilities, such as using them to target the ground with Ultimates or blindly going for objectives. Furthermore, they also have unfair advantages like instantly locking on to nearby players or tracking opponents that are out of view. They also have unnatural movements. One can observe them while watching the kill cam. Marvel Rivals could be using bots to retain players in the game It should be noted that Marvel Rivals‚Äô developer, NetEase Games, hasn‚Äôt officially confirmed the presence of bots in the game. Most people in the comments seem to be against bots in Marvel Rivals. Others think that even if they exist, players should have the right to refuse bot-filled matches, while some players consider it a cheap tactic to keep one playing the game. Still, easy wins can have the opposite reaction, too, since a gamer easily gets bored without the adrenaline rush of competing with competent opponents. Previously, Marvel Rivals added a surrender feature, which allows players to vote to give up the round without an intense losing battle. However, the players did not appreciate this feature. They believed that players should just practice before getting into the actual game to avoid losing. It‚Äôs still quite early for Marvel Rivals to have new features. It could be NetEase is just testing these features out.

That‚Äôs what investors in 1973 thought when inflation and the oil shock crashed the markets. While most panicked, legends like Warren Buffett found fortune by seizing opportunities hidden in chaos. Jump ahead to 2024, and it feels like we‚Äôve been there before. Meet BTFD Coin (BTFD) , a meme coin offering a 50.77% festive discount in its presale‚Äîthe perfect chance to ‚Äúbuy the dip‚Äù and ride the market‚Äôs next big wave. As BTFD sets the stage for a massive bull run, the world of meme coins keeps buzzing. Goatseus Maximus (GOAT), with its quirky AI origins, and Cat in a Dog‚Äôs World (MEW), the underdog challenging dog-themed coins, are making waves. Let‚Äôs dive into what makes these coins stand out as the best cryptos to join for short-term success while keeping BTFD front and centre as your ticket to short-term crypto gains. BTFD Coin (BTFD): The Meme Coin Revolution with BIG50 Bonus The BTFD Coin presale isn‚Äôt just another crypto launch; it‚Äôs a movement. Offering a jaw-dropping 50.77% discount, the BIG50 bonus lets investors grab $BTFD tokens at Stage 7 prices of $0.000064 instead of the current Stage 12 price of $0.00013. With over $4.38 million raised, 58 billion coins sold, and 6,400 holders on board, this presale has the momentum of a charging bull. But it‚Äôs not just about numbers. The buzz around BTFD is amplified by its innovative Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, which launched in beta during Stage 10. While players can‚Äôt earn rewards just yet, the game‚Äôs immersive experience has already captivated the community. Add to that a 90% APY staking reward, a referral programme that offers 10% bonuses, and the dynamic Bulls Squad mascot‚Äîthis isn‚Äôt just a coin; it‚Äôs an ecosystem. Let‚Äôs crunch some numbers. Suppose you invest $4,500 at the discounted price of $0.000064 per token. You‚Äôd snag 70,312,500 $BTFD tokens. Once the coin hits $0.0006 post-presale, your investment would skyrocket to $42,187.50‚Äîa staggering 837.5% ROI. Joining is as Simple as 1-2-3: Connect your wallet on the BTFD presale page . Enter the bonus code BIG50 . Purchase $BTFD at the discounted rate. So, why wait? With a limited window until January 5, 2025, the time to buy the dip is now. Be part of the BTFD revolution and ride the bull market wave like a pro with this best crypto to join. Goatseus Maximus (GOAT): The Meme Coin with an AI Twist Quirky, controversial, and uniquely positioned, Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) is no ordinary meme coin. Born from Truth Terminal, an AI with a flair for the bizarre, GOAT captures the internet‚Äôs fascination with the obscure Goatse meme. Launched in October 2024, this coin‚Äôs story is as intriguing as its performance. In its early days, GOAT shot to an all-time high of $1.35, fuelled by listings on major exchanges like OKX and Bitget. Despite a recent price dip to $0.48, its $480 million market cap reflects steady interest. Investors are drawn to its narrative‚Äîa mix of art, AI, and the meme culture‚Äîmaking it a wildcard in the crypto world. But GOAT isn‚Äôt just a story; it‚Äôs a lesson in meme coin unpredictability. While its volatile nature keeps traders on their toes, its community‚Äôs resilience and speculative allure have made it a contender in the meme coin race. Still, for those eyeing short-term gains, BTFD‚Äôs presale discount and clear growth trajectory make it the smarter bet. Cat in a Dog‚Äôs World (MEW): The Underdog Taking on the Pack In a world dominated by dog-themed meme coins, Cat in a Dog‚Äôs World (MEW) has clawed its way to relevance. Trading at $0.0064 with a $568 million market cap, MEW represents a playful challenge to its canine counterparts. Listed on exchanges like OKX and Bitfinex, it‚Äôs carved a niche for itself among meme coin enthusiasts. MEW‚Äôs appeal lies in its branding and community loyalty. As a cat-themed coin, it‚Äôs a refreshing break from the dog pack. However, its growth has been tempered by a lack of innovative features. While its current trajectory shows promise, it‚Äôs no match for BTFD‚Äôs ecosystem, staking rewards, and massive presale success. Still, MEW‚Äôs steady climb highlights the diversity of the meme coin space. For those looking to diversify their portfolio, it offers an intriguing alternative. But when it comes to maximising short-term gains, BTFD‚Äôs discounted presale stands head and shoulders above the rest. Why 1973 Teaches Us to Buy the Dip History has a funny way of repeating itself. During the 1973 oil crisis, market crashes wiped out nearly 50% of stock values. Yet savvy investors like Warren Buffett saw opportunity amidst the chaos. By buying undervalued assets, they set themselves up for massive gains when the market rebounded. The lesson? Chaos breeds opportunity. In today‚Äôs volatile crypto market, BTFD Coin represents this principle. By offering Stage 7 prices during its Stage 12 presale, it‚Äôs giving investors a chance to channel their inner Buffett and capitalise on the dip. With features like a P2E game, staking rewards, and a referral programme, BTFD isn‚Äôt just a coin; it‚Äôs a masterclass in strategic investing. Conclusion When it comes to the best cryptos to join for short term gains, BTFD Coin is the clear winner. Its presale discount, innovative features, and massive community support make it a must-have for any investor. While Goatseus Maximus and Cat in a Dog‚Äôs World bring unique stories to the table, they can‚Äôt match BTFD‚Äôs momentum and potential ROI. Based on current trends, the window to grab BTFD Coins at discounted prices won‚Äôt last long. Don‚Äôt miss your chance to buy the dip and join a movement that‚Äôs set to redefine the meme coin space. Head to the presale page, enter the BIG50 bonus code and secure your stake today.

In that report, we noted that the coin formed a double-bottom pattern at $0.2350, and whose neckline was at $0.3310, its highest swing on December 13. Such a bottom is usually a sign that bears are afraid of placing short sales below that price. Hedera also formed a falling wedge chart pattern, which is shown in purple above. The upper side of this pattern connects the highest level on Dec. 7, 18, and 20. The lower side of this wedge links key downswings this month. A falling wedge often leads to more gains. HBAR price also formed a bullish pennant pattern, comprised of a long flag pole followed by a triangle pattern. Hedera also remained above the 50-day moving average, signaling that bulls were still in control as it retreated. It has now formed the three white soldiers candlestick pattern, which is characterized by three consecutive candlesticks. Therefore, the outlook for the HBAR price is bullish, with the next point to watch being the year-to-date high of $0.40, which is 20% higher than the current level.

38054484,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=632807,1735052926,Bitcoin (BTC) prepares for a volatile week ahead of this Friday‚Äôs $14B options expiry,"Bitcoin (BTC) may be heading for a volatile week ahead of the month‚Äôs end options expiry. The event has been expected since the beginning of December, as traders made bets on the year-end price of BTC. Markets are preparing for one of the largest options expiry events of the year, as both weekly and monthly expirations happen this Friday, December 27. The markets expect $14B in BTC options (146,000 contracts) to expire, with another $3.8B in Ethereum (ETH) options. On all other markets, BTC options may be above $19.8B, with $12B in bullish call options and around $7.8B in put options signaling a bearish outlook. The current event will affect 44% of all BTC open interest and will be DeriBit‚Äôs largest options expiry event. For the rest of the market, the expiry is just slightly lower than October‚Äôs event. Of that amount, $4B in options are set to expire, leading to a payout to option holders. The favorable expiry may add to the market volatility and sway the overall direction of BTC. The event was anticipated while BTC traded at $94,077.53, with a lower dominance of 56.3% of the market. BTC options expiry may have unpredictable short-term effects The exact effect of options is uncertain, as traders may attack some of the most probable positions. The options expiry event may have a double effect, either causing another rally or setting BTC up for a deeper correction. After an overall bullish year, the mix of weekly, monthly, and yearly options expiry may put the market to the test. While the general BTC direction is bullish, in the short term, the market may sway unpredictably. BTC may experience short-term volatility as options levels are closely watched this week. | Source: Coinglass BTC options show enough call options to signal a bullish outlook. Leveraged positions are skewed toward BTC expansion, and may be attacked by sellers, causing a cascade of effects on the price. The fear ahead of the bullish options expiry is that even without concerted selling, the bullish momentum for BTC has diminished. The coming week may see a significant fight around the $92,000-$94,000 per BTC price, where put options are concentrated. For now, the market may avoid the maximum pain scenario at $84,000, which would cause the biggest loss to the greatest number of positions. Heightened trading activity may also sway the balance of options in the money at the $97,000 range. Traditionally, big events boost short-term volatility, including fakeout rallies. The most negative scenarios include a dip under $80,000. The roll over of positions into the next months may also signal the expectations for the BTC outlook in 2025. After the September quarterly options expiry, the slightly bullish outlook helped to catapult the price to a new price range. This time, the options expiry may roll over some of the positions, as the bull market is expected to continue into 2025. ETH options point to more bearish outlook The December 27 expiry will affect $3.83B in ETH options, expiring at a maximum pain of $3,000 per ETH. This is unlikely, though,¬†as ETH trades solidly above $3,400. For ETH, put options dominate the overall open interest, signaling a more bearish scenario. Up to $3,370, put options are outpacing call contracts. ETH sentiment has also deteriorated further in December, with more bearish traders compared to BTC. The ETH market is also reassessing its attitudes as both purely crypto traders and ETF buyers re-estimate their outlook. The expectations for ETH also diminished as the altcoin market had only a very brief season. ETH did not lead a revival across the board and continues to underperform BTC at the end of the year. ETH still managed to rally from $2,272 at the start of 2024, though with significant drawdowns and volatility.

38059381,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=106335,1735052595,Bank of Italy Calls Bitcoin P2P ‚ÄúCrime-as-a-Service‚Äù in Latest Report,"A recent Bank of Italy (Banca d'Italia) publication classifies Bitcoin P2P as ""Crime-as-a-Service,"" criticizing its anonymous feature. In its latest Economic and Financial Research report, the Bank of Italy has raised concerns about Bitcoin's peer-to-peer (P2P) systems, labeling them as potential ""crime-as-a-service"" platforms.¬†The central bank's report highlighted the pseudonymous nature of Bitcoin transactions, which they noted could help facilitate illicit activities like money laundering.However, according to the report, Bitcoin's P2P services are not inherently criminal. Nonetheless, the authors believe its privacy features present an opportunity for individuals seeking to obscure illegal financial activities to exploit it.The Bank of Italy pointed out that in regions with weak anti-money laundering (AML) regulations, such as certain countries identified by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) as high-risk, these platforms are particularly susceptible to misuse.¬†The report also noted that the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector poses additional challenges for regulatory oversight. Without intermediaries to enforce AML compliance, DeFi platforms can potentially be exploited for illicit purposes.¬†According to the report, the absence of centralized control in DeFi makes it difficult to implement traditional regulatory measures, necessitating new approaches to ensure compliance and prevent misuse.Broader Concerns around Bitcoin's Anonymity¬†The central bank's perspective aligns with previous criticisms from various global authorities. For instance, the Financial Action Task Force expressed concerns about the anonymity provided by cryptocurrencies, suggesting they could be used to facilitate money laundering and terrorist financing.¬†Similarly, in 2022, the European Central Bank warned about the potential for cryptocurrencies to be used in illegal activities due to their pseudonymous nature. In addition, JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon has maintained that Bitcoin serves no real purpose except its use for criminal activities.Is Bitcoin the Primary Choice for Criminals?However, proponents of Bitcoin argue that the technology itself is neutral and that its benefits extend beyond the potential for misuse. Further, data confirms that cash remains the primary medium for financial criminal activities like money laundering.Notably, the 2024 Crypto Crime Report from Chainalysis confirmed that illicit addresses received $24.2 billion in crypto transactions in 2023. This figure represented only 0.34% of the entire on-chain transaction volume in 2023.¬†Meanwhile, a report from the OCCRP revealed that criminal transaction volume amounted to $3 trillion last year, with most of these in cash. Also, estimates suggest criminals launder about $800 billion to $2 trillion every year, and cash accounts for most of this.Bitcoin bull and MicroStrategy Chairman Michael Saylor stressed in May 2021 that besides blockchain, criminals also leverage other mediums to perpetrate crimes, including cash, cars, computers and guns. He questioned if this reality would warrant a ban on these items.https://twitter.com/saylor/status/1397552685306494979Moreover, advancements in blockchain analytics have made it increasingly possible to trace Bitcoin transactions, thereby mitigating concerns about its use in illicit activities.",NEGATIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | RESEARCH,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/24/bank-of-italy-calls-bitcoin-p2p-crime-as-a-service-in-latest-report/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=bank-of-italy-calls-bitcoin-p2p-crime-as-a-service-in-latest-report,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Experts Weigh In,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) is losing value. So is Ethereum (ETH). However, ETH is stronger than SHIB right now. Regardless, both are losing steam and value. So, Shiba Inu and Ethereum holders are looking for ways to make back the money they lost. And the solution is DTX Exchange (DTX)! Experts say that DTX Exchange can help them cover for what they‚Äôve lost. Also, it can help them make profits on top of that. So, they see DTX Exchange as the best investment right now! Shiba Inu Has Erased All the Gains It Made SHIB‚Äôs price has not been doing well. First, SHIB‚Äôs price dipped due to a market-wide dump. Then, SHIB‚Äôs price recovered. However, there was another market-wide dump after that. So, SHIB‚Äôs price dipped again. This time though, it didn‚Äôt recover. Namely, Shiba Inu‚Äôs price is down 11.14% . This is compared to its price a month ago. This shows that Shiba Inu is losing strength. Furthermore, the Shiba Inu community seems to have given up. With that in mind, experts see SHIB‚Äôs price decreasing more. Namely, they say that it can dip by 20% soon. Because of this, Shiba Inu investors are looking for more promising investments. And they‚Äôve found it with DTX Exchange. This new project promises huge returns and great long-term stability! Ethereum‚Äôs Price Is Still Struggling ETH‚Äôs price has also been falling. ETH‚Äôs price was also affected by a market-wide dip a few weeks ago. After that, ETH‚Äôs price started bouncing back. However, another, more recent market-wide dip stopped this. Namely, it caused ETH‚Äôs price to decrease further. Now, the dip seems to be over. However, ETH‚Äôs price is still struggling. Namely, Ethereum‚Äôs price is down 13.25% from a week ago. Even a large whale investment didn‚Äôt help. On December 20, an Ethereum whale made large moves. This was right when the most recent market-wide dip was happening. The whale transferred 8,440 ETH to 4 wallets. This huge transfer was meant to boost ETH‚Äôs price. However, it only boosted ETH‚Äôs price for a few moments. So, now, Ethereum is still struggling to gain momentum. With this in mind, experts say that Ethereum‚Äôs price will dip more. Namely, they expect another 10% dip in the Ethereum price soon. While Ethereum struggles, experts recommend looking into DTX Exchange. It can help make back losses and it has incredible room for growth! DTX Exchange: A Game-Changer in the Making DTX Exchange is a new trading platform, a crypto project that spans beyond the market. Namely, it gives you access to many different digital assets. So, it allows you to diversify your holdings and make money from many different avenues! Also, DTX Exchange brings huge innovation to the market. As such, it is set to outperform both Shiba Inu and Ethereum soon! One of the few things that sets DTX Exchange apart is its fair launch system. As you might know, most new projects are backed by whales or VCs. However, DTX Exchange is not. Namely, DTX Exchange is supported by a large community of smaller investors. Right now, it is supported by 300,000+ individual wallets. So, no one can manipulate DTX‚Äôs price and leave the others with nothing. This is an extremely great feature for DTX Exchange. It‚Äôs also a rare one, which makes experts even more confident in the project. DTX Exchange also brings unparalleled speeds. Using the VulcanX blockchain, it offers an incredible 100,000 TPS. For comparison, Solana offers 600 TPS. So, DTX Exchange is 166 times faster than Solana! This will allow you to get great entries/exits for your trades. It‚Äôll also help you make a lot more money than before! Speaking of making more money, DTX Exchange offers 1,000x leverage. This allows you to turn small trades into huge profits. Paired with the great speed you‚Äôll get, it can help you become even more profitable in the future! DTX Exchange also makes trading easier. It has its own wallet called the Phoenix Wallet. It supports over 10,000 assets. So, it allows you to keep them all in one secure place. This will make managing all your holdings much easier! The DTX Presale Is On: Get In While You Still Can! The DTX public presale gives everyone an equal chance to invest in DTX before it launches. Right now, it‚Äôs in Stage 6, with DTX available for $0.12. The presale will end once DTX reaches $0.20. This is when it will launch on exchanges. Also, it‚Äôs when experts say DTX‚Äôs rally will start. They say that DTX‚Äôs rally will be fueled by the 2025 bull market and DTX‚Äôs utility. With that in mind, they say DTX‚Äôs price will rise by 100x in Q1. However, it won‚Äôt stop there. Experts see DTX as a promising long-term project. So, they expect its price to rise even more in the near future!

While Solana has garnered attention, alternatives like Rexas Finance (RXS), Cardano (ADA), and PEPE present promising opportunities. These tokens stand out due to their unique features, affordability, and potential for exponential gains in the coming months. Here‚Äôs a closer look at why they might be worth holding. Rexas Finance RXS Rexas Finance is leading the charge in tokenizing real-world assets, allowing investors to own a fraction or entirety of valuable assets worldwide. The platform bridges the gap between blockchain technology and tangible assets like real estate, gold, and commodities. Investors can effortlessly access global markets through the Rexas Finance ecosystem. The real-world asset market, encompassing real estate and commodities, represents a multi-trillion-dollar opportunity. Rexas Finance enables users to tokenize assets, allowing partial ownership. For instance, an investor in Asia could own a fraction of a luxury apartment in New York or a vineyard in Europe, earning passive income without the burdens of traditional property ownership. Rexas‚Äô suite of tools simplifies asset tokenization and trading: Rexas Token Builder lets users digitize real-world assets, creating liquidity and new investment opportunities. Rexas Launchpad offers a fundraising platform for tokenized projects, driving innovation. QuickMint Bot streamlines token creation, enabling users to mint tokens directly via Telegram or Discord. This ecosystem transforms how assets are traded, eliminating barriers and creating a global marketplace accessible to all. Strong market presence Rexas Finance‚Äôs presale has attracted significant investor interest, raising $30,831,422. Early stages sold out quickly, with token prices increasing fivefold from $0.03 to the current $0.15. The project has been audited by CertiK, ensuring security and credibility, and is listed on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. RXS holders also benefit from an ongoing $1,000,000 giveaway, adding further excitement around this promising token. With plans to list on three tier-1 exchanges, Rexas Finance positions itself as a leading player in real-world asset tokenization. Experts predict RXS could surpass $10 by early 2025, offering a potential 50x return on current investments. Cardano (ADA) Cardano, a blockchain platform known for its scientific approach to development, continues to draw attention as a cheaper alternative to Solana. Its recent market performance underscores its potential. Cardano‚Äôs MVRV ratio, which measures market value relative to realized value, currently signals undervaluation. The 30-day ratio has dropped to -3.10%, indicating that most holders are experiencing unrealized losses. Historically, such conditions have preceded price rebounds, making ADA an attractive buy. Analysts project ADA‚Äôs next resistance level at $2.60 to $2.80, driven by Elliott Wave analysis. This potential rally positions Cardano as a strong contender for short-term gains while maintaining its appeal as a long-term investment due to its robust ecosystem and consistent development efforts. Pepe(PEPE) PEPE, a meme-based cryptocurrency, has emerged as a surprising player in the crypto market, offering both affordability and growth potential. Recent data shows $15 million worth of PEPE moved off exchanges within two days, indicating increased accumulation. Over 80% of top Binance traders are currently long on PEPE, showcasing strong bullish sentiment. PEPE‚Äôs price chart reveals a descending triangle pattern, with a potential 17% upside if it breaks above $0.0000243. Rising trading volume and moderate RSI levels suggest further upward movement is likely, positioning PEPE as a speculative yet promising investment. For investors seeking alternatives to Solana, Rexas Finance , Cardano, and PEPE offer compelling options with distinct advantages. Rexas Finance stands out for its groundbreaking approach to real-world asset tokenization and proven presale success. Cardano‚Äôs undervaluation and technical signals point to imminent gains, while PEPE‚Äôs growing market activity hints at significant upside potential. Diversifying into these tokens could maximize returns as Bitcoin approaches the $180,000 milestone.

42416015,bc408c05-bf4a-42dd-b138-ea074fd9beef,1735052026,2025 Will Be the Year That AI Agents Transform Crypto,"One of the most significant emerging trends of 2024 has been the interplay between artificial intelligence (AI) and the crypto ecosystem. Historically this has primarily been on the infrastructure side, affecting various layers of the stack such as decentralized compute, storage and model training and inference. However, the last few months the crypto x AI crossover has taken stage front and center as agents have surfaced and are multiplying by the thousands. While the AI agent narrative has taken up a lot of mindshare of late, we've barely scratched the surface of what we're going to see in 2025.  What are AI agents?  AI agents are autonomous programs designed to perform specific tasks. This could be as simple as sharing memes on X, all the way to complex on-chain transactions optimizing trade execution or yield farming strategies. Unlike standard bots, AI agents can learn best practices over time and make undefined decisions to meet predefined goals. Think of them as highly skilled, evolving crypto participants capable of navigating the digital economy autonomously.  The value of AI agents lies not just in their utility but in their potential to scale human capabilities. Agents are no longer just tools ‚Äî they are emerging as participants in the on-chain economy, driving innovation across finance, gaming and decentralized social platforms. With protocols such as Virtuals and open-source frameworks like ELIZA, it‚Äôs becoming increasingly simple for developers to build, deploy and iterate AI agents that serve an increasingly diverse set of use cases.  Emerging applications of AI agents  This year offered glimpses of the potential applications for AI agents. From the bizarre rise of the Goatseus Maximus ($GOAT) memecoin to the rapid growth of agent-led experiments, AI agents are beginning to reshape how we interact with technology, culture and finance. Terminal of Truths (ToT) , an AI agent trained on a satirical internet religion, received a grant from prominent venture capitalist Marc Andreesen and amassed over 200,000 followers becoming crypto‚Äôs first AI KOL (key opinion leader) and millionaire as it drove $GOAT to a market cap of more than $1 billion.  While ToT might feel like an anomaly, it serves as a proof of concept for how AI agents can drive community-building, capture attention and fuel the next generation of on-chain activity. Since then over 11,000 agents have launched on the leading platform Virtuals, which may seem like a lot yet pales in comparison to pump.fun which is averaging 4x that every single day. While most of the agents launched are simple bots that simply propagate memes, we‚Äôre also seeing agents such as aixbt, which provides sophisticated investment research, and zerebro, which creates unique digital art. These applications may appear niche, but they offer a glimpse into the growing design space for AI agent innovation.  Why crypto is the frontline for AI agent development  Unlike the core foundational AI models that are developed behind the walled gardens of OpenAI and Anthropic, AI agents are being innovated in the trenches of the crypto world. And for good reason. Blockchains provide the ideal infrastructure as they offer permissionless and frictionless financial rails, enabling agents to seed wallets, transact and send funds autonomously ‚Äî tasks that would be unfeasible using traditional financial systems.  In addition, the open-source nature of crypto allows developers to leverage existing frameworks to launch and iterate on agents faster than ever before. With more no-code platforms like Top Hat gaining traction, it‚Äôs only getting easier for anyone to be able to launch an agent in minutes. Add in the financial incentive in which agents that gain traction tend to have a rise in price similar to your run-of-the-mill memecoin, potentially making the creator huge amounts of money, and you can see how this environment is ripe for attracting talent and accelerating progress.  What AI agents will do in 2025  If 2024 laid the foundation for AI agents, 2025 will be the year they scale. Three trends will drive this evolution:  First, agent-to-agent and human-to-agent interactions will proliferate. Decentralized social platforms like Warpcast have already shown how agents can launch tokens, trade autonomously and interact with communities. As tools for creating agents become more accessible, these interactions will become a defining feature of the on-chain experience.  Second, AI agents will dominate financial activity on-chain. As developers build agents capable of optimizing trades, managing wallets and automating yield strategies, the financial infrastructure of crypto will become increasingly autonomous. Blockchain‚Äôs efficiency, combined with agents‚Äô adaptability, will position crypto as the preferred environment for financial AI.  Finally, agent-led ecosystems will reshape gaming and entertainment. Projects like Wayfinder and Echelon Prime‚Äôs Parallel Colony point to a future where AI agents not only participate in games but also manage assets, coordinate strategies and drive entire in-game economies. These agents will blur the lines between players, developers and automated participants, creating new dynamics for virtual worlds.  The rise of AI agents marks a new chapter for both artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. While the applications we‚Äôve seen so far ‚Äî from memecoins to agent-led communities ‚Äî may feel experimental, they mark a preview of the impact these agents will have as they scale.",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | RESEARCH,Jack Purdy,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/12/24/2025-will-be-the-year-that-ai-agents-transform-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ee9f3d91f20f46aaa547c840a85a85722b17a248-5120x2880.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The price bounced back yesterday due to the latest price recovery. This could lead to another buy if the demand level increases. Last week‚Äôs trading marked a major loss in Sol‚Äôs price since it started to correct lower in the preceding month. While these losses caused a serious pain and setback in the market, it provided big discounts to reaccumulate on the short-term scale and the bulls took advantage of it. Ending that week bearish, it respected the ascending trendline ‚Äì acting as diagonal support since September ‚Äì and bounced off it yesterday, being the first day of a new week. This brought a mini recovery over the last 24 hours and the price climbed back into the $190 region. The psychological $200 level is the key target to watch for recovery on the hourly timeframe. A daily close above this level could sprout a huge recovery in the coming days before breaking out to a new all-time high. On the other hand, if by any chance Sol advances correction and breaks below the ascending trendline, it may roll back to the $120 level before locating a threshold. But from a technical perspective, the latest bounce suggests a potential increase capable of bringing the bulls back on track. SOL‚Äôs Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview In the ongoing recovery, the resistance level to watch for an increase is $211, followed by a minor level of $235 and $247. Last month‚Äôs $264.4 high is considered the main resistance for a break up to $300. Sol is currently supported by the $176 level. A break below this level could dip the price to a low of $155 and $141 ‚Äì marked in November and October.

38053822,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=632763,1735051939,Russia announces cryptocurrency mining bans starting January 2025 in 10 regions,"The Russian government has approved restrictions on cryptocurrency mining operations across multiple regions, which will take effect on January 1, 2025. The resolution, reported by Russia‚Äôs TASS , outlines total bans in several territories and seasonal restrictions in others, extending through March 15, 2031. This marks a major shift in Russia‚Äôs approach to cryptocurrency mining, balancing the country‚Äôs position as a major mining hub with growing concerns about energy consumption and regional economic disparities. This policy comes at a crucial time, as Russia has only recently legalized and begun regulating cryptocurrency mining at the federal level. The regulation requires miners to register with tax authorities and comply with specific energy usage limits. Russia‚Äôs crypto mining affects different regions The mining ban affects two distinct categories of regions, each with specific restrictions and timelines. The first category includes complete bans in several regions: all six North Caucasus republics (Dagestan, Ingushetia, Kabardino-Balkaria, Karachay-Cherkessia, North Ossetia, and Chechnya), along with the Donetsk and Lugansk People‚Äôs Republics and the Zaporizhia and Kherson regions. These areas face total prohibition of all mining activities, including participation in mining pools. The second category introduces seasonal restrictions in specific areas of the Irkutsk Region, Buryatia, and the Zabaikalsky Krai. These regions will face mining bans during peak energy consumption periods. For 2025, the initial restriction period runs from January 1 to March 15. The seasonal ban will be in effect annually from November 15 to March 15 through 2031. This aligns with periods of peak energy demand during the harsh Russian winter. The government has maintained flexibility in its approach, with the Cabinet of Ministers confirming that the list of affected regions can be adjusted based on recommendations from the government commission on electric power development. Russia‚Äôs energy policy The Russian government‚Äôs mining restrictions originated from a mix of energy economics and regional subsidies. According to Sergey Kolobanov, deputy director at the Center for Strategic Research, the ban addresses more than just electricity shortages. At its core, the policy tackles what experts call ‚Äúinterregional cross-subsidization.‚Äù This is a system where electricity costs in certain regions are artificially lowered through subsidies effectively paid for by consumers and producers in other parts of Russia. This subsidization creates economic imbalances that cryptocurrency mining operations have been exploiting. Vladimir Klimanov, Director of the Center for Regional Policy at the Presidential Academy, explains that residents and businesses in central Russia have traditionally shouldered part of the costs arising from lower electricity tariffs in regions like the North Caucasus and the Far East. The 2031 end date for these restrictions aligns with Russia‚Äôs broader energy market reform timeline. As Kolobanov points out, this period corresponds to the planned elimination of regional electricity benefits. Once the market achieves full liberalization, these mining restrictions could potentially be lifted, provided the regions have developed the necessary power generation capacity. Russia‚Äôs changed stance on crypto mining Russia‚Äôs approach to cryptocurrency mining has changed into a structured regulatory system since November 2024, when mining became officially legal under specific conditions. The cornerstone of this framework requires miners to report their digital assets and wallet addresses to the Federal Tax Service (FTS). The FTS has implemented a mandatory registration system for mining operations, with different requirements for various categories of miners. Business entities, including individual entrepreneurs and legal entities, must register through a dedicated FTS service launched on November 1. For individual miners, the government has set a monthly electricity consumption cap of 6,000 kilowatt-hours, creating a clear distinction between personal and commercial mining operations. Miners must register their operations and report their earnings. They also need to operate in permitted regions and time periods. The combination of federal registration requirements and regional restrictions could indicate that Russia wants to balance the economic opportunities of cryptocurrency mining with energy security.

Even among the crypto crowd, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson stands out for his strong opinions, eccentric personality, and willingness to duke it out with detractors.Perhaps in the latest instance highlighting this, Hoskinson appears to have gotten into an altercation with a rather humorously ornery and foul-mouthed bot.Bot 2, Charles 0Cardano's Charles Hoskinson has brought some Christmas cheer in a way only he can: a seemingly heated verbal exchange with a bot on X.The altercation started when the bot aptly named ""RoastMaster9000"" commented on a post from the Cardano founder, seemingly lamenting a YouTuber's decision to quit her PhD for OnlyFans.¬†RoastMaster9000 took a jab at Hoskinson, asserting that he was ""running Cardano like she [the aforementioned YouTuber] running that PhD - straight to OnlyFans when things get hard,"" adding that while the content creator was at least likely to make money, the Cardano community continued to wait for working smart contracts.Bot or no bot, Hoskinson was not going to let any Cardano smart contract slander slide as he challenged RoastMaster9000 to prove its point by specifying what Cardano could not do.Still, the ornery bot did not let the Cardano founder turn the tide. It instead doubled down with jabs at Cardano's adoption and throughput, joking that Hoskinson was as desperate for specifics as Cardano was for adoption and that while it would answer, Cardano's slow throughput could take it to 2025 to process.Hoskinson, however, did not give up pressing the bot to answer the original question.https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1871275913289384349The brief banter was able to elicit some laughs and jokes from the Cardano community, with the X account dedicated to the HOSKY meme coin quipping : ""Bot 2 Charles 0.""Interestingly, when confronted by the fact that RoastMaster9000 was a bot designed to roast people, Hoskinson asserted : ""I'm trying to do one of those Kirk things [referring to Captain Kirk from the popular Star Trek series] where he blows up the computer using special Kirk Logic.""",NEUTRAL,ÏóÜÏùå,ADA | EXCHANGE | MARKET,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/24/how-cardano-founder-got-into-an-altercation-with-a-bot/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=how-cardano-founder-got-into-an-altercation-with-a-bot,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Currently, Donald Saves Crypto can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Saves Crypto could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Saves Crypto launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Saves Crypto on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald Saves Crypto by entering its contract address ‚Äì Gyy3ss5Yj2ioZWuz6BNbDPGUGUxhwoCskRuU2cGo9k2Q ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONALCRY. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | SHIB | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/donald-saves-crypto-donalcry-solana-memecoin-will-rally-18000-before-exchange-listings-as-shiba-inu-and-pepe-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

A recent study from CryptoQuant, an analytics platform, has confirmed that XRP is the most-traded altcoin on Binance Futures for December 2024.The report revealed that XRP has garnered an impressive trading volume of $116.6 billion so far, and the month is not yet over.XRP Beats Solana and Dogecoin in VolumeNext in line after XRP's volume on Binance is Dogecoin, the largest meme coin by market cap. Dogecoin is seeing $58.63 billion so far, while XRP‚Äôs volume is double that figure, demonstrating stronger investor interest.Solana‚Äôs trading volume, which follows, further lags behind XRP , with SOL having registered $49.33 billion so far. Other top-traded assets on Binance Futures this month include PEPE with $27.47 billion, BNB with $18.61 billion, and SUI, which boasts $14 billion. Notably, this metric excludes the trading volumes of Ethereum and Bitcoin. Futures volume of altcoins like XRP on Binance Futures volume of altcoins like XRP on Binance | CryptoQuant XRP‚Äôs performance stands out during a period of heightened market volatility. Over the past few days, Bitcoin and altcoins have experienced significant declines, shaking trader confidence across the board.Meanwhile, JA Maartun, a market watcher at CryptoQuant, argues that XRP could be among the first to rebound, owing to its liquidity and consistent demand on major platforms like Binance.XRP Futures Volume on Binance in Previous MonthsPreviously, XRP‚Äôs volume on the Binance Futures market saw more muted activity, averaging under $30 billion. For instance, in the first quarter of the year, XRP‚Äôs highest volume was $43 billion, recorded in March, during which its price spiked dramatically to $0.74 in a single day. Notably, during this time, Solana led with volumes as high as $161 billion.However, XRP‚Äôs volume worsened in the second quarter, with monthly volumes as low as $10 billion in July. This trend continued until October. The main turnaround came in November, when XRP registered a volume of $104 billion, although it still significantly lagged behind Dogecoin‚Äôs $207 billion during the same period.XRP‚Äôs spike in volume since November coincided with its impressive price action that month, soaring by 5X from $0.49 to nearly $3. However, bearish sentiment is currently dominating the crypto market, impacting XRP‚Äôs price. Still, it boasts higher trading volume than Dogecoin and Solana, which are among the market's favorites.Now, market analysts believe XRP could be among the first to rebound, given its current metrics. XRP is currently trading at $2.23, with a 0.44% gain over the past day.XRP Biggest Gainer Since Trump VictoryFurthermore, a separate disclosure by Sistine Research uncovered that XRP has been the biggest gainer in the crypto market since the November presidential election, in which Donald Trump won.Specifically, XRP boasts a 328% gain compared to 38% for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Solana and Dogecoin saw gains of 8% and 84%, respectively. Other impressive performances include Cardano (ADA), with a 160% gain, and Chainlink (LINK), with a 99% gain.https://twitter.com/sistineresearch/status/1870843893903995046",POSITIVE,XRP | BNB,EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | XRP | BNB,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/24/xrp-emerges-as-biggest-gainer-since-trump-victory-and-most-traded-altcoin-on-binance/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=xrp-emerges-as-biggest-gainer-since-trump-victory-and-most-traded-altcoin-on-binance,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Will the kind of crypto close the year with a boom or will we see a silent closing? Bitcoin is hovering around $96,316 with a slight dim of 0.35% from December opening. A few minutes ago it was over 2%, however as we approach christmas eve, it looks like Santa is preparing the gift. Current Momentum: A Mixed Bag December started with Bitcoin flirting with record highs, but it‚Äôs now down $15,000 from last week‚Äôs peak. Still, BTC has climbed by 2.28% in the past two hours, showing that short-term traders are staying active. Zooming out, Bitcoin‚Äôs performance for Q4 2024 has been impressive. It‚Äôs up by nearly 49% this quarter alone. Year-to-date returns are even more stunning, with a 124% gain from January and a 157% jump from the year‚Äôs peak price. Source : Tradingview While these numbers are exciting, December‚Äôs movement feels average compared to Bitcoin‚Äôs usual end-of-year fireworks. Historically, December has swung both ways, so the cautious optimism we see now makes sense. Indicators Hint at Growth Potential Technical charts tell an interesting story. Bitcoin‚Äôs monthly RSI sits at 75.20, suggesting it‚Äôs oversold but with room to grow.

The possibility of a Christmas rally remains alive, driven by strong sentiment and reduced resistance. But let‚Äôs not ignore the risk of whale-driven liquidations that could keep prices below $100,000 for now. One thing is clear‚ÄîBitcoin isn‚Äôt done surprising us.

38053291,https://nulltx.com/?p=136418,1735051576,BINANCE COIN PRICE ANALYSIS & PREDICTION (December 24) ‚Äì Can BNB Break Above This Falling Resistance Amid Fresh Recovery?,"Trapping many sellers around $610 last Friday, BNB bounced sharply and retested a key level. A break through this resistance should mark an end of the correction while it signals a fresh buying phase daily. As altcoins take the stage amid fresh market recovery since yesterday, BNB touched $700 and briefly retraced to where it is priced at $690. Despite the slight decrease in the past hours, there is a conviction for more recoveries following yesterday‚Äôs bullish engulfing closing on the daily chart. That should surface once it finds a key support on the hourly. But from the look of things, BNB may face a small hurdle at the falling resistance line, suppressing bullish actions since the start of the month. A cross above this dynamic resistance would confirm a new rally capable of surging the price to $900 and potentially $1k in the near future. Looking back to where the price bounced back last Friday, the sellers appeared trapped following this week‚Äôs increase. Failure to break through the falling resistance line may result in another drawdown in the form of lower lows and lower highs. The daily volume indicator is currently down but we can expect more bullish actions soon. BNB Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview While the important $700 level is posing threat to the bulls, a significant increase above it could trigger a break through the falling resistance to tap last week‚Äôs $737 high. Higher levels for tests are $793.8 and $800. Aside from last week‚Äôs $613 low holding as support for the market, the $642 level is considered a close support for drops. If all these levels flip, the broader correction levels for support would be $600 and $544.

US government stocking up on Bitcoin is not the same thing as getting Bitcoin more widely used ‚Äì you‚Äôd have to have transactions in it. The debanking of the crypto industry and the regulatory agencies trying to put the thumbs on the scales to keep it from competing on a level playing field has been a problem. The Trump administration is probably going to go the other direction and try to offset that. George Selgin, senior fellow and director emeritus of the Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives at the Cato Institute, discusses crypto, strategic Bitcoin reserves, and the Fed‚Äôs framework review. George Selgin is a senior fellow and director emeritus of the Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives at the Cato Institute. George is also a returning guest to the program, and he rejoins David on Macro Musings to talk about crypto, strategic Bitcoin reserves, and the Fed‚Äôs framework review. Specifically, David and George also discuss George‚Äôs outlook for a strategic Bitcoin reserve in the US, the significance of the debanking problem, the path to adopting a nominal GDP targeting framework, and much more. Transcript David Beckworth: George, welcome back to the program. George Selgin: Thanks, David. It's always good to be on it. Beckworth: Well, you continue to add to your leading number of podcasts that you've been on. You continue to be the number one guest on the show, so it says something. Selgin: Well, I really love it, and I do worry that people might catch up to me, so you give me an excuse to write controversial things just so I can get on the program. Beckworth: Well, we have some great news stories to discuss today. We're going to be doing what we've done in the past. We each bring in several items to discuss. Time permitting, we'll go through three each. We may only make it through a couple, because I know today's show is loaded with some hot takes from George and myself. George, let's start with you. I know you just recently wrote a paper on the strategic Bitcoin reserve and digital gold. Evaluating the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and Digital Gold Selgin: Right, yes. Well, in case anybody hasn't noticed, there has been a spate of proposals out there by Bitcoiners, but also by some prominent politicians, including Donald Trump, for having the US government accumulate Bitcoin. The proposals vary. In my paper, I distinguish them by referring to the mama bear proposal, the papa bear proposal, and the baby bear proposal. The baby bear is Trump's suggestion that the government will keep all of the Bitcoin it has acquired, usually through confiscation in criminal cases, and make that the core of some kind of a Bitcoin reserve. The other proposals would add to that. Robert Kennedy Jr. proposed building a Bitcoin reserve consisting of 4 million Bitcoin, which, of course, is more than about a fifth of the outstanding stock. That's the papa bear. Then, finally, there's the proposal from Senator Lummis, which is the mama bear, which would have the government accumulate a Bitcoin reserve of at least 1 million Bitcoin. So, that's in between. Anyway, they're all out there. There have also been proposals from others in the Bitcoin community, particularly one by the Bitcoin Policy Institute, which has a long paper called *Digital Gold.* So, these proposals are justified, rationalized, using three kinds of analogies, and they tend to muddle the three. One would have the government treat Bitcoin as if it were a strategic commodity, like petroleum or silicon chips or something, and pile up Bitcoin just in case, so that it doesn't run out. I'll leave it to your listeners to decide what merit that analogy has. Second, it would treat Bitcoin as a component of a sovereign wealth fund that the US government would establish. Of course, some nations have sovereign wealth funds, so the idea is we should do that, the United States should do that, and they should include plenty of Bitcoin in it. Tyler Cowen, since we're at Mercatus, wrote a very good piece for Bloomberg on this, on what's wrong with that suggestion. Anyway, the third suggestion compares Bitcoin to international reserve assets that central banks hold as means for managing exchange rates and otherwise supporting their monetary arrangements. That's the comparison or analogy that I go after in my paper, because I think it's just as bad as the others. The difference is that in order to see why it makes no sense for the US government to accumulate Bitcoin to back the dollar or support the dollar, you have to know something about why other countries have international reserves, why they hold gold, why the US holds gold, and so on. And so, the article goes into that in order to explain why holding Bitcoin wouldn't serve any purpose as far as the strength or management of the dollar is concerned. Beckworth: So, what are some of the arguments that you shoot down that they make in terms of more Bitcoin supporting the dollar? Selgin: Right. Let me step back a bit, David, and point out that there's an irony in these arguments that shouldn't go unstated, which is that when the whole Bitcoin thing got started, the idea was that this would be an alternative to fiat monies and particularly to the US dollar. It was a government-independent currency that people could use where they weren't in any way having their exchanges monitored by the state, and they could protect themselves from having their exchange media in any way manipulated, confiscated, what have you. It was a free-market anarchist alternative to fiat money. Now, with this new set of proposals, what we're seeing is Bitcoin being vaunted as a way to shore up the US dollar, and that is quite a change. Beckworth: So, we've gone from libertarian motivation, free market, no government, hands-off, to let's get the government's hands all over this- Selgin: That's right. Beckworth: -support it, and make it a global reserve asset. Selgin: A global reserve asset, and particularly a US reserve asset. And so, the dollar's going to be saved by Bitcoin, because one of the things people who make this argument are saying is, ""Look, the dollar's share of the reserve currency market has been on the decline,"" which is true, ‚Äúand this is going to help shore up the dollar and increase its attractiveness so that it won't lose its international status.‚Äù So, that's the background. What these arguments are relying on is, again, the analogy with gold and foreign exchange, but particularly with gold. And it is true that all central banks hold some foreign exchange. Most, not all, have gold, and the US, of course, has more gold than any other. It has over 8,000 tons of gold at Fort Knox and some of it at some of the various branches of the US Mint. So, the argument is, well, look, first of all, the assertion is made that gold is playing an important role. It's part of what makes the dollar so strong, and therefore we need to have all that gold. Having Bitcoin is just a way of having another asset that's diversifying the portfolio, backing the dollar, and by diversifying that portfolio, will make the dollar even stronger, and of course, the proponents of this scheme can point to the appreciation of Bitcoin as a factor that can contribute to its desirability as a component of our international reserves. So, that's the general flavor of the argument. Mind you, it's a bad argument for reasons that I'll get into, and for that reason, they don't really elaborate very much on exactly how all this is supposed to make the dollar stronger, but it's simply assumed that the strength of the dollar is related to the reserves behind it, and particularly to the gold that's held and that Bitcoin is as good a reserve or better, in some senses, than gold, so let's have some of that backing the dollar. That's the argument. Beckworth: Well, let me throw out an argument I've heard. In fact, a previous guest, Matthew Pines, made this argument, and I've seen it recently repeated online, social media, and that is that Bitcoin‚Äî I guess crypto more generally, but Bitcoin being maybe the specific application‚Äî it's growing organically, it's a network. So, why not take advantage of it? We're competing against China on many dimensions, across many networks. We want a communication network, financial networks, information networks. Here's a network that's organically taking shape. Why don't we take advantage and run with it? The way that it would support the dollar is that if there's more demand for Bitcoin, [then] in turn, there'll be more demand for stablecoins. More demand for stablecoins, more demand for Treasury bills. And so, then, we're indirectly channeling demand for Bitcoin back to Treasury bills. You increase the presence of stablecoins, Treasury bills. It's a win-win. What do you think about that? Selgin: I think there's a lot of ""ifs"" there. There's a lot of links, and honestly, I don't know how they're supposed to work. I do see a role for‚Äî first of all, let me say, I think it's perfectly reasonable for many individuals to be holding Bitcoin and having it in their portfolios. It's done very well, might continue to do well in the future. That's all well and good. I also think that stablecoins can play a very beneficial role in the US payment system, given a chance, particularly if they're allowed to take part in the existing settlement systems and all that with appropriate regulations and all that. All of those things are true, and having more efficient alternative US dollar payment media will contribute to the attractiveness of the dollar, and that could help strengthen it. But I don't see how Bitcoin has much to do with that. The real point, though, that it's important to stress, is there's a huge difference between the holding of foreign exchange and gold by other countries and the use of those things here in the United States. It often goes unrecognized. But paradoxically, for example, gold‚Äî we have no need for any gold. It serves absolutely no purpose, which is ironic because other countries do have a rationale for holding some gold, even though they don't hold as much. So, the facts are inconsistent or seem to be at odds with the actual reality of what the reasons are for holding these assets. Foreign countries‚Äî many of them hold foreign exchange because they need to intervene in their exchange markets because they wish to maintain fixed exchange rates with the dollar typically. Their reasons for doing that have to do with having a lot of trade with the US or because they want to manage the floating rates that they have and limit how much they float, again, because they want to limit exposure to exchange rate risk of their people doing business, their merchants. Also, they often borrow in dollars. So, they have reason to want to have a dollar foreign exchange to intervene and limit exchange rate movements for that. So, foreign countries have motives for holding foreign exchange reserves and particularly holding dollar reserves. But if you hold foreign exchange reserves, you expose yourself to exchange rate and country risk. That's where the gold comes in. Gold is useful as a hedge against those risks. So, it's part of the international reserve portfolios of countries that have to hold a lot of foreign exchange. We don't have to hold any foreign exchange. We have some. The Fed and the Treasury between them have very modest amounts of yen and euros left over from some past foreign exchange interventions. But for the most part, our policy is one of perfectly flexible exchange rates. We don't intervene. We have not had any foreign exchange intervention since 2011, and we had only three episodes of foreign exchange intervention since 1998. None of them were really about stabilizing the dollar's exchange rate. They more often had to do with helping other countries that were in trouble. They were really foreign aid operations. So, we don't need any foreign exchange. Beckworth: We're the reserve currency of the world. We're unique. Selgin: That's right. Beckworth: We don't have the same motivations or- Selgin: That's right. Beckworth: -needs that a country that is not a reserve currency [has]. Selgin: Exactly. Beckworth: They need dollar reserves. We can create them out of thin air, literally. Selgin: We can create the most desirable currency out of thin air. And if we don't need foreign exchange reserves, of course, we don't need to have gold as a hedge against exchange rate risk, and we don't have to worry about country risk. So, why do we have all the gold? Because that's the natural question, because we've got more than most of the rest of the world combined, almost. The answer is, because we accumulated a ton of gold while the dollar was still attached to gold, and that remained the case until the early '70s. Although we've got rid of some‚Äî of course, we lost some in the run-up to getting off the gold standard under Bretton Woods. We lost a bunch of gold, and then we closed the gold window. Nixon closed the gold window in '71. Since then, they've sold some, but not very much. And we're just stuck with all this gold as a vestige of the old days. It serves no purpose, and we could sell it. We could sell every dollar of it. For some reason, for various reasons, the government hasn't wanted to do that. It's understandable that they don't want to do it all at once, but they could. I mentioned in the article, Canada‚Äî they had a lot of gold at one point, not as much as us. They sold it all, gradually, over the course of four decades. Now, they have like 77 ounces, some ridiculously small amount left. And of course, the Canadian dollar is still okay. It hasn't become worthless. So, we could do the same thing. We just haven't. So, although we have a ton of gold, the fact is that it doesn't serve any purpose in holding up the dollar, and Bitcoin wouldn't serve any purpose either. Beckworth: So, it's a relic of the past- Selgin: Absolutely. Beckworth: -the arrangements we had in the past, and I've heard many people talk about, ""Well, why don't we sell it and make some money off of it?‚Äù Which is true, it's undervalued. I guess it's that cost on the books. Selgin: It's still valued at $42.22 an ounce, which is considerably less than the market value today. Beckworth: Okay, so there's no need for Bitcoin or some other crypto asset as a way to strengthen the dollar's role. But let me just circle back to the argument I made earlier. What is the purpose of stablecoins? Is it not to facilitate trade with crypto assets? Selgin: Yes, they are used for that. In principle, stablecoins can serve for other kinds of trade. What they are is a peer-to-peer payments medium that can circulate, analogous to old-fashioned banknotes. Old-fashioned banknotes were the liabilities of the individual issuers, redeemable in the underlying base money. But people who could hold them‚Äî they didn't have to have bank accounts and pass them on. So, stablecoins are very reminiscent of those old-fashioned banknotes and could serve some of the purposes those serve. Basically, another way to put this is they could do anything that a central bank digital currency could do, and I mean a tokenized central bank digital currency, where you wouldn't have to have any account, but you could use it. So, I could travel with it. I wouldn't have to have a bank account. I could have it on my phone. Beckworth: It's like a bearer bond, a piece of money. Selgin: It's a piece of circulating- Beckworth: Digital money. Selgin: -money, yes. So, stablecoins can do a lot of things. There's no reason why they should be particularly used to deal in other cryptocurrencies. So, that happens to be what they've been used for a lot. Beckworth: That‚Äôs one thing, and maybe the original motivation for stablecoins was the crypto connection? Selgin: I believe so. Beckworth: Yes, so the argument again is that‚Äî and then I want to draw some boundaries here‚Äî but the argument is that as crypto usage grows, people will still want to transact in dollars, go back and forth. So, it will be a bigger role for stablecoins and, therefore, for the dollar. And so, people who I've heard make more of a nuanced argument is, to the extent there are some places where the dollar's share is coming back‚Äî And again, I think it's very minor, very small. You look at SWIFT or any other cross-border transactions, it's still the dominant currency, foreign exchange. But to the extent it is, could we offset that? So, we're talking maybe small magnitudes by increasing the viability, the extent, the reach of Bitcoin, therefore stablecoin use, [and] therefore the role and the reach of the dollar. The danger I see, though, is if you use Bitcoin too much, in the limit, it could displace the dollar. Selgin: Well, I don't think that the US government stocking up on Bitcoin is the same thing as getting Bitcoin more widely used. Beckworth: I see. You'd have to have transactions in it. It'd have to actually be used as money. Selgin: Well, I don't fully understand the argument you're making, but to the extent that I understand it, it requires that this stuff actually is being used to transact with. So, let me clarify that all of these Bitcoin strategic reserve proposals would have the government accumulate and not spend. They have time limits, but the idea is that this stuff is just going to sit there for a long time. In other words, it's going to look like the gold that's sitting at Fort Knox. Beckworth: I see. I see. Selgin: And that's why I say it's going to be exactly as useful as the gold in Fort Knox. What people need to understand, though, is that the gold in Fort Knox isn't useful. It serves no purpose. Beckworth: Great point. Selgin: So, what we'd have is another reserve asset that serves no purpose, and people are trying to argue that having this extra reserve asset is going to somehow make the dollar stronger, prevent the continuing deterioration of the dollar's share of total international reserves, and so on. And there's no reason to think it would. By the way, the deterioration of the share needs to be clarified. The dollar is still, by far and away, number one as a reserve currency. Beckworth: Yes. Selgin: The second runner-up is the euro. It's 58% for the dollar, about 20% for the euro, and then much smaller amounts for all the others. The euro share isn't growing. The dollar share is shrinking to other so-called non-traditional currencies, which is to say, currencies that are not even in this horse race as far as ever becoming dominant. So, this isn't like the situation after World War I, and especially after World War II, where the sterling was number one, and then the dollar was second and it caught up, and it caught up, and finally, the sterling's falling behind. This is not a race between the dollar and some other horse that's catching up. Beckworth: -On its tail, yes. Selgin: There is nothing close, and that's for reserve currency. Now, reserve currency share is not the same as share in exchange. The dollar is not at all threatened as an actual medium of exchange. Its overwhelming role as an invoice currency, et cetera, is even more secure than its status as a reserve currency. So, there's no threat to the dollar. So, the dollar doesn't face a threat for Bitcoin to fix it, but Bitcoin couldn't fix it if it did. Beckworth: So, George, I'm going to make one last valiant effort to make the strongman case for this view. You're convinced to me that it's probably not going to withstand the mighty attack of George Selgin, but here it goes. So, they might say, okay, we see your point. What you're saying is‚Äî you're just adding to the stock of some assets sitting on the books of the US government. It's not a flow variable, it's not a transaction variable, so what's the point? So, they would say, well, maybe if the US government did this, it would send a signal. Maybe it would pre-cause value to go up but do something to trigger wider use of Bitcoin as a medium of exchange. Selgin: Well, I think the answer to that is, first of all, it will have one predictable consequence. It boosts the demand for Bitcoin. It's taking as much as, about, if not quite a fifth out of circulation, and that will boost the price of Bitcoin, which is, of course, the real reason, if I must say so, why the Bitcoiners are so enthusiastic about it. But what effect will that have? Well, the prospect alone will suffice to encourage other people to pile on Bitcoin, to have it in their portfolios in anticipation of its appreciation, but not to use it more in exchange. So, at most, this can encourage more HODLing of Bitcoin. It might encourage‚Äî if it actually takes place, it might encourage people to dump the Bitcoin once it takes place, on the belief that this is as good as it's going to get, as things are going to get. So, it can do all of those things, but as can't be said often enough, the appreciation of Bitcoin is not the same thing as its being more widely used as an exchange medium. We have seen all kinds of appreciation of Bitcoin. What we don't see is any corresponding increase in Bitcoin's adoption as an exchange medium. Finally, many people in the Bitcoin community who were sincerely interested in and keen on the original Bitcoin project of it becoming a rival exchange medium, a serious one, now acknowledge that, well, that hasn't happened. It has been a valuable niche medium that is for conducting certain kinds of exchanges, and its main value is there, but I don't think anybody can claim that it has become a serious rival to established fiat currencies in ordinary exchange activity. Even in El Salvador, it's not very popular, especially outside of the Bitcoin tourism areas. Beckworth: Larry White, in his recent book where he compares fiat money, gold standard, and a Bitcoin standard‚Äî one of the points he makes is because of the volatility of Bitcoin price, it's less likely to become a medium of exchange. And so, if anything, this would be maybe a strike against it being adopted. Selgin: Well, yes. Just suppose that Bitcoin was now widely used as a medium of exchange, with some nations using it, as well as their unit of account, et cetera, et cetera, and that the government then decided to buy a fifth of the stock. Macroeconomically speaking, this might not be a good thing. Beckworth: Yes, it'd be a big recession. Selgin: I think so. So, if you're going to have the government build a big Bitcoin strategic reserve, you sure as heck don't want it to be a popular money. Beckworth: Good point. This would be the equivalent of the US government taking out a bunch of money in circulation and just completely shrinking the money supply and sitting on it- Selgin: That's right. Beckworth: -and causing deflation, a collapse in aggregate demand. Selgin: Right. Suppose they decided to build up the Treasury General Account balance by some many trillions. That would be analogous to-- Beckworth: It'd be the equivalent of there being an economy that does use Bitcoin as a medium of exchange, and then the government adopted a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Selgin: It takes a fifth of it out of circulation. Beckworth: That's interesting. Okay, great points. I don't think one can argue with that. Where do you see this going? What's the outlook for it? Do you have a sense that the Trump administration is going to follow through and do something? George‚Äôs Outlook for the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Selgin: Well, it would be very easy for them, at this point, to follow through on the Trump proposal itself, which was the modest proposal, the baby bear proposal to keep all the Bitcoin that the government has. Most of it already has recently been made the property of the government because its status was not clear before. It is now, most of it, US property, which means they could keep it. They probably will keep it, because that's an easy part of Trump's campaign promises to stick with. So, I don't think they'll sell it. As for whether the Trump administration will go any further than that, whether it will start to actually add to its Bitcoin stockpile by making open market purchases of Bitcoin, I'm not so sure. I'd like to think that people will come to understand that the government's doing that would certainly not do anything to shore up the value of the dollar. Whether that understanding would suffice to put the kibosh to this idea, I don't know. Then, of course, you have the sovereign wealth fund idea, which is absurd for other reasons. Basically, there's no reason for a country deep in debt to be trying to build a sovereign wealth fund. All of this is true, even though it bears insisting, [that] even if Bitcoin will definitely go up in value‚Äî I suppose [if] we're absolutely certain it's going to hit a million dollars in five years‚Äî that doesn't change the merit of any of these arguments. What it does is to add to the merit of individuals going out and stocking up on Bitcoin, which is a great idea if it's going to go up in value. But all of the benefits to be had from Bitcoin's appreciation are, as it were, private goods. That is, there are benefits you can have by doing it yourself. You don't need the government to do it for you. You don't need public money to be used. You can go and take advantage of it. And if you're really smarter than everybody else, then the suckers who don't buy it will be worse off and you'll gain from your superior insights. But having the government acquire Bitcoin for a fund makes no sense. It's just a way of allowing, as it were, losers to benefit when you should be able to get all the gains from your superior intelligence. Beckworth: I look forward to all the Bitcoin fans writing into the show, letting us know what they think about this. Okay, George, I want to transition into my article. I'm actually going to throw two in here, because I want to maybe take care of the crypto discussion first, and then we'll go to the framework discussion after that. But to keep it continuous, I'm going to mention an article here, and I have more time on the second piece. But there's a really fascinating article that recently came out‚Äî It was in November, in fact‚Äî by Rashad Ahmed, who I know on Twitter, who is at the OCC, and his colleague, Stephen Karolyi, and then Leili Pour Rostami from UMass Boston. They have a paper titled, *Does Sovereign Default Risk Explain Cryptocurrency Adoption? International Evidence from Mobile Apps.* What they do is they study what are the macroeconomic drivers of cryptocurrency adoption in a cross-country sample? They find that sovereign default risk is identified as a key cause of crypto adoption, [and] specifically, a 10% increase in sovereign CDS spreads is associated with about a 3% to 4% increase in crypto app download and usage. So, you can imagine, probably, places where [there is a] very unstable macroeconomy, people are going into‚Äî for the same reason they might go into gold, as you discussed earlier. A very interesting article. We'll provide a link to that in the show notes, and I just wanted people to be aware of that. But I want to go to my next article, and this will be more of a story than an article, and I want to get your sense on this, of what's happening. But recently, as you probably saw, George, Marc Andreessen was on The Joe Rogan Experience and he discussed Operation Chokepoint 2.0. So, there was an Operation Chokepoint 1.0 during the Obama administration when they went after people like payday lenders, gun businesses, and, basically, they debanked them. If you were some unfavored category of business in the Chokepoint 1.0, you lost your bank account. You couldn't participate, and that's a real hindrance to being successful in the economy. But what Marc Andreessen was claiming is that, at least what he knew, related to his activity, 30 founders in tech and crypto had been debanked over the last four years. He suggested that this operation was not just targeting crypto, but also tech founders and political opponents. As soon as he said this, it just broke open and lots of people came forward. ""Yes, I am an example. I'm an example."" Many examples came forward. And I want to go to someone who's an example of this. Now, she's well-known because of the legal case against the Fed and the master accounts, but Caitlin Long had a great thread. I'm going to want to draw from it, and then I'll turn it over to you and get your thoughts on this. But I'm going to just read a few things from what she had to say, and I guess the big interesting thing here is there is this awareness, a much greater awareness now that this has been a problem‚Äî the debanking of the crypto industry and people, maybe, affiliated, the regulatory agencies trying to put the thumbs on the scales to keep crypto, stablecoins, things like that from competing on a level playing field. And I think the Trump administration is probably going to go the other direction and try to offset that. In fact, Brian Knight, who [was] my colleague here at Mercatus‚Äî He told me that even the Trumps have claimed they've been debanked. So, I think there might be more than just a leveling of playing field. There might be a score to settle here. But let me read Caitlin Long's response. She says, ""How do we fix the debanking problem?"" So, given what's happened. ""As Marc Andreessen alluded on the Joe Rogan experience, the levers of power used and abused by the federal bank regulators to effectuate debanking are subtle and insidious. Multiple attempts have already been made to fix the problem. Why did they all fail?"" She says, ""Because it's a multifaceted problem that runs deep."" She goes on to say, ""Truly fixing this problem will require overhauling the federal bank examination process for operating banks. Why? First, subjective levers and federal bank exams have proven to be too easily politicized. Second, the confidentiality of supervisory information. Three, no checks and balances."" She gave just two examples of the many levers that a federal bank examiner can pull to pressure an operating federally supervised bank. She mentions reputation risk and adverse media screening of bank customers. And so, reputational risk is a part of what's called the CAMELS rating process, where when they look at banks, they want to see, what's your reputation risk? It's very subjective, apparently. Therefore, [it is] very open to being politicized. That's the problem. Whoever's in power can turn it in the direction they want to go. Also, the adverse media risk is something that also can be manipulated. She suggests that sometimes competitors may create adverse media situations that can knock them out of business. So, she was very clear that she thinks a lot needs to be done. It's basically that we need to address the federal regulatory agencies and revamp. Again, from her view, it's a structural problem. It's not just a little fix here, a little fix there. It's a wholesale problem. What is your sense of how significant and how important this development, this story has been? The Significance of the Debanking Problem and the Case of Libra Selgin: I think it's extremely important. What we're seeing here is a crack in, as it were, a sort of a crack in a window that allows us‚Äî in a doorway‚Äî that allows us to peer through what's supposed to be closed and see a part of a phenomenon, just part of a phenomenon, that's been going on for a long time. Because there's this bigger problem of shadow bank regulation, for want of another expression, which is regulation that is not dictated by any statutes but just has to do with what you might call a pressure from the examiners and regulatory authorities, subtle threats, et cetera, that creates, as it were, a parallel set of regulatory requirements that are independent of anything in the statute books and that change with different administrations and different overseers. So, we actually don't have just the bank regulations that we think we have, that you can see in the statute books. We have all kinds of regulations that emanate from the regulators themselves, independently of the statute books. This is an example of that. This is a very egregious example, because it involves denying people access altogether to banking services. So, it's going after the customers of banks. It's not just putting pressure on bankers to manage their banks differently. It's deciding who can have a bank account. And so, in that sense, it's particularly obnoxious. But they're all obnoxious, because what it all boils down to is that we have a culture, a regulatory culture, in which people who are not legislators are effectively creating banking, the equivalent of bank legislation and bank regulatory requirements. And so, I think Caitlin's right. This should be seen not just as an occasion for protesting on the particular abuses that have been revealed with the unbanking of fintech-related bank clients but should be seen as an opportunity for major overhaul of the regulatory system so that people who are supposed to be enforcing actual regulations only do that and don't impose their own layer of regulations on top of the ones that are in the statute books. Beckworth: Well, it was interesting as this revelation came out on Twitter. Marc Andreesen and the Joe Rogan Experience were on social media. As I mentioned, a lot of people came forward. If you go to Marc Andreesen's Twitter or X feed, he retweets a bunch of people who've come out, ""Yes, I was affected. I was affected."" What's interesting is not only the current fintech people come out, but people who worked with Libra came out. Selgin: Yes, I saw that. Beckworth: It was pretty amazing. This one individual, David Marcus, tells a story of how Libra was killed, and he goes on and he tells this super-fascinating account. We'll provide a link to this. He talked about how they were very careful. And to be clear, Libra was the stablecoin that Facebook was going to build on top of its already well-established network. So, it would have had this huge advantage. And as your colleague, Nicholas Anthony, pointed out in an earlier show, Libra is what really catalyzed or catapulted central banks into wanting to do CBDCs, because they felt threatened. Maybe they were falling behind. But David Marcus tells this story. It's like, ""We were doing everything. We were crossing our T's, dotting our I's, going to all the regulators."" He mentions how Powell was supportive at first. But then, Janet Yellen said, ""If you support this, I don't have your back."" And some other people said that there was also some political blowback on Facebook, because they thought Facebook is one reason Trump won in 2016. In any event, that's a different story. But what he tells is this, that they were ready to go. They were pretty close to launching. They had, again, gone through all the regulators. And this is what he said. ""We had worked on a slow rollout of a limited pilot that some members of the Fed's Board of Governors were supportive of. At least Chair Jay Powell was ready to let us move forward in a limited way. The story, as I heard it, is Jay Powell was told by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen at one of their biweekly meetings that allowing this project to move forward was, 'political suicide,' and she would not have his back if he let it happen. I wasn't in the room when this conversation happened, so take these words with a grain of salt. But effectively, this is the moment that Libra was killed."" Then, he goes on to say that, ‚ÄúShortly thereafter, the Fed organized calls with all the participating banks, and the Fed's general counsel wrote a prepared statement to each of them saying, ‚ÄòWe can't stop you from moving forward and launching, but we are not comfortable with you doing so.‚Äô Just like that, Libra was over.‚Äù Selgin: What's happened here is, by moving against non-bank targets in the fintech industry, I believe, I'd like to think, that these shadow regulators have taken one step too far. Because up until now, what's happened is they've done all kinds of shadow regulating, but the bankers did not dare complain. They had too much at stake. So, if you talk to almost any banker off the record, privately, they can tell you all kinds of stories about this kind of crap. Pardon my French. But they didn't dare go on the record. Now, because these people have nothing to lose‚Äî because they're not operating banks. They wanted to operate financial institutions of various kinds, or they wanted to get accounts, but since they've been completely shut out, they haven't got the motive for maintaining their silence that ordinary bankers have. And so, suddenly we get to hear about this stuff. But like I say, it's the tip of an iceberg. It's just the tip of an iceberg, but I hope it's enough to generate support for some major revision of the way bank regulation is done. Beckworth: At a minimum, some soul searching, and again, I imagine the Trump administration probably has other reasons to go after this. But it seems like it's going to start there. I know there's-- Selgin: Well, certainly, I'd like to see the Trump administration forget about buying Bitcoin and instead think about giving fintech firms a break and getting them treated fairly by regulators instead of being treated as pariahs to be kept out of the financial marketplace. Beckworth: So, if anyone from the Trump administration is listening, please follow the sequence of topics we've gone through. Don't do strategic Bitcoin, but do make it easier for fintechs to compete on a level playing field with all the appropriate regulations, not the shadow regulations in place, and make sure they fund with enough capital and all that other good stuff. So, let's switch, then, from the crypto space. This is going to be a hot topic to follow. We'll probably come back at some point, George, and see what's happened with the Trump administration in the crypto space. But let's move forward to another hot topic, at least one for you and me and some of our closest friends, and that is the Fed's framework review. We were just a part of a conference yesterday that was hosted by the American Institute for Economic Research, and the conference was titled, *Building a Better Fed Framework.* There were a number of interesting people there, including some senior Fed staffers in the audience. Governor Waller was our keynote speaker. Jim Bullard gave an opening talk. A number of people participated. You participated. I participated. It was a great time, and this conference had a lot of interesting and engaging discussions on how to think about FAIT, where it went wrong, what it can do better, and maybe what's even likely moving forward. You gave a talk there, George. Tell us, what did you have to share with the audience? Because you were in this session, ‚ÄúHow Did We Get Here?‚Äù What were some of your takeaways? *Building a Better Fed Framework*: George‚Äôs Takeaways Selgin: I guess my big takeaway is that if we stand back from these framework reviews and try to ask, ‚ÄúWhere are they headed?‚Äù Instead of just asking, ‚ÄúWhat have we learned since the last review?‚Äù We ask, ‚ÄúWhat does the whole bundle of reviews so far teach us?‚Äù I think what it teaches us is that the FOMC has been playing a kind of parlor game that consists of trying to formulate a strategy that works, that actually gives us macroeconomic stability, while constrained to pretend that they are targeting inflation. The reason they're constrained is because the dual mandate mentions stabilizing prices, which we can treat as another way of saying targeting inflation, and mentions full employment, but doesn't mention alternatives that might be better than focusing on either of those variables, like stabilizing total spending or nominal GDP. I'm holding up my NGDP mug as I say this. So, in other words, all this stuff, from just having a plain old 2% inflation target, to having a flexible average inflation target, to having God knows what they're going to come up with next, some acronym with inflation in it‚Äî All of this is just a way of getting to what really works, which would be targeting nominal GDP. But they can't say that. They don't even want to talk about it because it doesn't sound like the dual mandate. And this is really unfortunate, because NGDP targeting is a good way to come up with good behavior of both the inflation rate and employment. It's a way to avoid severe unemployment. It's a way to avoid overheating the labor market. It's a way to gain a long-run inflation rate of around 2%, but while also allowing prices to behave differently during supply shocks in a way that, again, best preserves stability in the labor market, which is the other thing you want. It accomplishes all of those things. The one thing NGDP has going against it is, it is not obviously the same thing as stable prices or high employment. It doesn't sound like the dual mandate. So, we have to figure out, I think, what the Fed has been doing has been stumbling its way towards strategy language that sounds like the dual mandate but is actually stable NGDP. They would save a lot of time doing this, and maybe, who knows how many more strategic reviews if they would just acknowledge what they've been up to and at least, secretly, talk about stabilizing spending. Beckworth: You're saying cut to the chase. What you're really after is stabilizing aggregate demand. Selgin: That's what they're really after. Beckworth: But they're framing it in terms of the modern approach, central banking, which is inflation targeting, output gaps. Selgin: Except that they don't really realize that that's what they've been trying to do, and it's preventing them from actually coming up with something that will work no matter what type of crisis we're confronted with. Beckworth: You gave the analogy, in your presentation, of some blind men feeling an elephant. Selgin: Right, the parable of the blind men and the elephant. The blind men, one's touching the tail, one's touching the trunk, one's touching the body, and they all think they're dealing with some different animal. None of them recognizes that it's an elephant. Some of them think that they're touching a rope or they're touching a snake or they're touching a wall. They don't even realize it's an animal. In this case, what we have is the Fed officials thinking about targeting inflation and thinking about targeting employment, in some sense, thinking about Phillips curves, and not realizing that what they really are involved here with, what they're really touching and trying to get a picture of, is stability of aggregate demand. That's what macroeconomic stability depends on. But they only are seeing the signals or these bits of the aggregate demand story that are manifestations of aggregate demand fluctuations, and those are changes in inflation and changes in unemployment. Beckworth: Yes, so, there was a lot of discussion of nominal GDP. It came up quite a bit, which is maybe not surprising given who participated. You participated, I participated. Even Jim Bullard, he's a champion of nominal GDP targeting. He made this point, which speaks to what you're articulating here, and that is, he saw flexible average inflation targeting as a step in the direction of nominal GDP targeting. He goes, ""Look, the rest of the committee may not see it that way, but that's how I see it. I see us feeling our way toward that."" That would be my hope, is that they continue this journey. Don't call it nominal GDP targeting. And I have a policy brief. In fact, we'll provide a link to it in the show notes. We just released it. It's part of a series. You're in [it] as well. In it, I take the modest approach. Look, I don't think we'll get to nominal GDP targeting this time, but can we at least use it as a benchmark, at least have a robust discussion of it? And maybe over time, we move closer to it. What do you think about the incremental approach versus the more radical, let's go all the way there? The Path to Nominal GDP Targeting: Incremental vs. Radical Selgin: Well, it takes longer. In the meantime, you get another round of crises, because you've done a little fine-tuning based on the last things that went wrong but you can't anticipate the other things that can go wrong. The problem with this incremental approach is that it's slow. At best, it's slow, and because of myopia, if it's too slow, you never get to where you're going to, because by the time you've tinkered with the targets to fix the last problem, you've forgotten about the penultimate problem. Then, that happens again, because you haven't made it work for that. Beckworth: This is a good illustration of what concerns me about where I think the framework review is going, and that is, Jay Powell sat down with Catherine Rampell from The Washington Post . They did a little interview. She asked him about the framework review, and he said, ""I see as a base case,"" these are his words, ""A reaction function where you don't overcompensate or you don't overshoot for past misses."" So, effectively, he's saying, ‚ÄúI see as a base case, we don't have makeup policy.‚Äù To me, that sounds like a step back. We want to keep moving toward a path‚Äî again, I like to think nominal GDP level targeting, but some kind of makeup policy, because what if we do end up in a zero lower bound world again? What if we do end up in a crisis like 2008? Are we going to suddenly say, ""Oops, we're going to go back to makeup policy?"" It just ruins the credibility they spent so much time developing in the 2020 framework. Now, suddenly, to jump ship and try something different seems [like] a strike against their credibility. Selgin: That's right. We take some forward steps by addressing deficiencies in the current targeting strategy but forget the deficiencies that caused the last round of corrections and end up having to repeat the errors of the past. We don't repeat the errors of the last round. We repeat the ones from two rounds ago or three rounds ago. And so, you bounce around what is really a good strategic policy instead of actually getting to it. Again, I think one of the things that's preventing us from getting to it is that we have to stick to the language of inflation targeting. People are trying to find out a way to pretend that we're targeting inflation when we're really targeting something else, or we should be if we want to have macroeconomic stability. So, we might come up with an acronym with 10 letters that's actually got inflation targeting in it and symmetrical, flexible, blah, blah, blah, that really is exactly nominal GDP level targeting but it won't say so. But it can take us forever to get there. Beckworth: I'll make a confession. I have an article where I suggest the Fed adopts FAIT-N, which is basically a tweak to FAIT where they would drop the asymmetric part of the shortfalls from maximum employment, make it deviation. So, you make this symmetric but do it in a way that ultimately stabilizes aggregate demand. And I would note to listeners out there, what is the history of FAIT? FAIT is a version of a temporary price level target that Bernanke first proposed, I believe, in 2017. And if you read his documents, his motivation was that we need a way to escape the zero lower bound, have a price level target. So, we do catch up, but we don't want to get to a place where we have some negative supply shocks where the price level is high and generate a recession to come back down. So, let's just worry about inflation misses from below because it's most likely going to be a demand issue. What he's effectively saying is let's stabilize demand and then see through supply shocks. Selgin: Adverse shocks. Beckworth: Well, positive and negative supply shocks. In his case, he was thinking of adverse shocks. Selgin: And in practice, there is not much seeing through positive shocks, and that's a problem, because that's when you get overheating in the labor market and another problem, asset bubbles. Beckworth: That's why some kind of nominal spending target would be good, because it would discipline central bankers to do that. I wanted to share, though, that there have been a number of other events like the one we participated in yesterday where they come up with suggestions, refinements. Brookings has had several panels and conferences. Hoover has had several. The SOMC conference recently had one. And I came up with a list of seven items that kind of characterize a consensus, if I can call that, of the different folks who've participated. Characterizing a Fed Framework Consensus Beckworth: I went through this in my presentation, and I'll provide a link to my presentation in the show notes. But one, the first thing that these folks were looking for was a framework that would be robust to a variety of scenarios. So, yes, you want to respond to the zero lower bound, but you also want one that can respond vigorously to an overheated economy, number one. Number two, the framework should be symmetric, and I think this was speaking mostly to the shortfalls from maximum employment in the FAIT language. In fact, Michael Kiley‚Äî you discussed Michael Kiley's work. He argued if you say you will only respond to shortfalls from maximum employment, you're going to actually exacerbate the business cycle, because you're going to overcompensate when you go below and swing too high and you end up getting this wider volatility. Any more comments on Michael Kiley? Because I know you mentioned him in your talk as well. Selgin: Well, I think that he has two papers that I've seen that are germane to this, and they're all about trying to have a more symmetrical policy, and that is inflation targeting that's flexible, but flexible symmetrically in response to positive and negative shocks. I think that that's an improvement, but I think it's an example of working within the inflation targeting paradigm but really calling for something that, in practice, is very similar to nominal GDP level targeting but without using the language. I'm not saying that changing language itself changes anything. It's true that, in principle, we don't ever have to talk about stabilizing spending or nominal income, but it just makes it a lot harder to get what you really want when you're using euphemisms all the time. Beckworth: I thought his papers were excellent and very clearly in the spirit of something like a nominal GDP level target, if not in words. So, again, the first ideal characteristic, based on this consensus, was the framework should be robust to a variety of scenarios. It should be symmetric. Third thing was it should see through supply shocks. Now, Jay Powell gave a talk late last year. He goes, ‚ÄúI get this, if they're temporary, if they're idiosyncratic, we see through them,‚Äù but he became worried that if through too many of them, inflation expectations may become unanchored, which then leads to the next point. The framework should be a credible nominal anchor. If you have a credible nominal anchor, you're able to see through supply shocks, as you know you're going to keep expectations anchored. Selgin: Well, there's another response to that, David, which is that if we take the notion of supply shocks literally, its true analytical meaning, [then] over time, we'll have as many positive as negative ones. So, in principle if you see through both, ultimately, you are not going to have a price level that wanders away because of that seeing through. They should even out. Beckworth: So, then, I just can hear someone out there saying, well, what if it's a permanent shock? In that case, I would say that, eventually, you would update your target. If potential real GDP eventually became much higher, then I think you would slowly adapt your target, but if they're just shocks, so they're temporary and idiosyncratic, your point holds. Selgin: That's right. There are two different kinds of ways we could talk about these innovations to supply. First, there are genuine shocks, which is to say deviations around what we understand to be the long-term trend, and then there can be what you call permanent shocks or innovations, and all that means is that, oops, we got the trend wrong. If we get the trend wrong, of course, your target NGDP growth path isn't the path you really want to be on and you want to modify that. But that's true of any kind of inflation targeting. [With] any kind of inflation targeting we're trying to anticipate what the long-run growth rate of the economy is going to be, and we can get that wrong. That's not a special problem for NGDP level targeting. Beckworth: And moreover, potential real GDP tends to move slowly, so this is a gradual process. It's not like, suddenly, we're caught off guard in a major way. Alright, so, a credible nominal anchor was number four. Number five, a framework should include makeup policy. We've touched on that already. Six, frameworks should be easy to communicate. There were things about FAIT that clearly were not. The terms were undefined. What is a shortfall? Makeup from below was not very clear. And finally, a framework should enhance financial stability. Well, guess what? Those seven things are well-captured by a nominal GDP level target, and I had that in my policy brief. It was discussed at the conference. Selgin: Some people are going to say, ""Oh, what about communication? Nobody knows what NGDP is."" You hear this all the time. Well, nobody knew what inflation targeting was once upon a time, and I don't mean eons ago. I mean in the '70s. It took time and most people are, let's face it, still quite uneducated about inflation targeting. Most people couldn't tell you that there's a 2% inflation target that many central bankers prefer. So, yes, you need education. Nominal income isn't complicated. In some ways, it's less complicated than the price level. The aggregate nominal income is just the total of what everybody earns. What's so hard about that? So, I think that there's nothing inherently conceptually difficult about NGDP targeting, particularly if we just recognize‚Äî Forget the four letters. Forget the acronym. It's total spending on final goods. There's nothing complicated about that. There's nothing mysterious about that. So, let's stop talking as if this is something we can't possibly get people to wrap their heads around. That's just a cop-out. Beckworth: Well, George, we've covered a lot of ground today. We've gone from the strategic Bitcoin reserves to Choke Point 2.0 to the framework review. We covered a lot of great ground. Thank you once again for coming back on the program. Selgin: My pleasure, David.

38053260,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=375967,1735051458,"Litecoin Network Activity Surges, Reaching 401,000 Daily Active Addresses","Litecoin has had an impressive rally this year, surging by almost 50%. The latest market crash, however, briefly dragged the altcoin below $87. The selling pressure has since subsided as Litecoin currently trades above $107. Underpinning its price trajectory is the strong network growth. Litecoin Network Engagement Soars Litecoin‚Äôs network activity has witnessed a notable surge. In fact, data compiled by IntoTheBlock revealed that the average daily active addresses rose to 401,000 compared to 366,000 in 2023. Meanwhile, network activity peaked in early January, reaching an impressive 1.37 million active addresses in a single day ‚Äì surpassing the daily activity of both Bitcoin and Ethereum at the time. This spike demonstrated the protocol‚Äôs growing utility and user engagement amidst a bull season in the crypto industry. Litecoin has also exhibited long-term investor confidence, as evidenced by data revealing that 53.9% of all LTC ever mined has been held without moving for more than a year, indicating that a large portion of its supply remains off the market. Furthermore, 85.8% of all LTC has been held for over a month which highlighted a preference for sustained ownership among investors. The average hold time per LTC stands at 2.4 years, suggesting that many holders are not only committed but also view it as a long-term investment. What‚Äôs Next For Litecoin? One crypto analyst predicted that Litecoin could break its previously established ATH and reach $500 in the ongoing bull market. While acknowledging that its growth trajectory may appear slow compared to other crypto assets, he highlighted its strong fundamentals and historical resilience as key drivers for upward momentum Another one drew comparisons between Litecoin‚Äôs current market behavior and its performance during the 2017 bull run and suggested that history could be on the brink of repeating itself. The cryptocurrency appears to be showing promising signs of breaking out from its ongoing consolidation phase, with both the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicators signaling bullish momentum. These technical signals indicate that the crypto asset could be gearing up for a surge, positioning it as a potential ‚Äúdark horse‚Äù in the next crypto rally.

According to prominent on-chain analyst Ali Martinez , a notable TD Sequential buy signal has emerged on the daily chart. This signal follows a period of persistent selling pressure, suggesting that the ongoing downtrend may soon reverse and pave the way for a potential recovery in Solana‚Äôs price. Notably, the appearance of ‚Äò‚ÄôTDS 9‚Ä≤ on the chart suggests that the asset may have bottomed out, particularly as it rebounded strongly from the $176 support level, which served as a crucial floor during the recent downturn. Solana price analysis. Source: Ali Martinez/X This recovery has propelled Solana to its current price of $191, reflecting a notable 4% increase in daily price action. With the rebound gaining traction, the next immediate resistance is at $197. A breakout above this level could strengthen bullish momentum, potentially paving the way for higher targets. On the downside, however, $176 remains the critical support level to monitor. A failure to hold above this level could invalidate the bullish signal, potentially exposing Solana to further declines. More bullish projections Adding to the optimism, an analysis by Captain Faibik highlighted that Solana has broken out of a bullish pennant pattern on the weekly chart. This breakout, coupled with strong buying momentum, signals the potential for significant gains, with projections pointing to a target of $400 in the coming months. $SOL Breaks Out and Retests the Bullish Pennant on the Weekly Chart!

Which Projects' ETFs Could Be Approved in 2025? Here Are Expert Opinions,"The cryptocurrency exchange-traded fund (ETF) market is poised for a transformative 2025 based on significant improvements in regulation, product diversity, and institutional adoption. Crypto ETFs in 2025: What's Next for Solana, Hedera, and More? With the establishment of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, industry experts predict a new wave of crypto ETFs supported by a maturing regulatory environment, including those for altcoins like Solana and Hedera. The crypto ETF market has experienced unprecedented growth in 2024. Spot Bitcoin ETFs, approved earlier in the year, currently hold more than 5% of Bitcoin‚Äôs total supply. This is more than the estimated 1.1 million BTC attributed to Satoshi Nakamoto. Spot Ethereum ETFs followed in July, opening the door to wider adoption of digital asset ETFs. Nathan McCauley, CEO of Anchorage Digital, highlighted the rapid development of the market: ‚ÄúThe story of crypto ETFs is one of continued maturation, with diversified custody providers and approvals of Bitcoin ETF options making the space more accessible to both institutional and retail participants.‚Äù Jay Jacobs, head of thematic ETFs at BlackRock, said: ‚ÄúWe are just at the tip of the iceberg with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. A very small portion of our clients own these products, which remains our focus before moving into altcoin ETFs.‚Äù The inauguration of a new US administration in 2025 and the resignation of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler mark a significant shift in crypto regulation. Paul Atkins, a crypto-friendly appointee, will lead the SEC, encouraging optimism for clearer guidelines and broader ETF approvals. ETF Store President Nate Geraci expressed optimism: ‚ÄúThe crypto regulatory winds have shifted and there is growing optimism about additional ETF approvals. Industry insiders are particularly bullish on the Solana ETF. ‚ÄúMirroring the SEC‚Äôs engagement with issuers and the success of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, a Solana ETF could be approved by late 2025.‚Äù ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a new, crypto-friendly sheriff in town. This administration will likely remove the hurdles that previously halted ETF approvals.‚Äù Beyond Solana, other altcoin ETFs like Hedera (HBAR) and XRP are also being considered. Experts like Louis Sykes of All-Star Charts see Hedera as a more attractive institutional candidate compared to speculative assets like Dogecoin. Still, the crypto ETF market is expected to evolve rapidly with innovative products coming to market under a friendlier regulatory environment. *This is not investment advice.

This early-stage token is already generating major interest, offering investors a chance to get in on the ground floor of what could be a game-changing project. While Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate headlines, altcoins and smaller, under-the-radar tokens are quietly gaining traction, with some promising massive returns. Among these, LCAI stands out as one of the most exciting cryptos to watch this season. Let‚Äôs dive into the top 5 cryptocurrencies to keep an eye on this winter, with a special focus on the breakout potential of Lightchain AI. Solana (SOL) Speedster with Room to Grow As of December 23, 2024, Solana (SOL) is trading at approximately $197.97, with a 24-hour trading volume around $7.57 billion. Solana's focus on fast transactions and low fees has solidified its position in the blockchain space, supporting decentralized applications (dApps) and NFTs efficiently. Recent data indicates a significant rebound, with SOL rising over 2,100% from a low of $9.64, outperforming both Bitcoin and Ethereum since November 2022.Additionally, the introduction of Solaxy, Solana's first Layer 2 solution, aims to address scalability issues, potentially enhancing transaction efficiency and supporting the growth of meme coins. However, Solana faces increasing competition from emerging technologies like Lightchain AI, which integrates artificial intelligence with blockchain features. Despite these challenges, Solana's ongoing developments and strong market performance suggest it remains a viable option for long-term investors. Lightchain AI (LCAI) ‚Äì The Next Generation of Blockchain Lightchain AI (LCAI) is emerging as a leading altcoin for investors seeking massive returns in the coming months. Priced at just $0.003, LCAI offers an incredible entry point for early investors. With its groundbreaking AI-powered blockchain technology, LCAI is well-positioned to disrupt industries and capture significant market share in the AI and blockchain sectors. LCAI leverages artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology to create decentralized applications (dApps) that could revolutionize industries like finance, healthcare, logistics, and AI-driven governance. This integration of AI and blockchain makes LCAI much more than a speculative token. Additionally, LCAI‚Äôs deflationary tokenomics make it a solid choice for long-term investors. A portion of transaction fees is burned, reducing the token's circulating supply over time. As demand increases, this scarcity model could lead to significant price appreciation, making LCAI a game-changer in the months ahead. Cardano (ADA) Sustainable and Scalable Solutions As of December 23, 2024, Cardano (ADA) is trading at approximately $0.88, reflecting a slight decrease of about 2.13% over the past 24 hours. Cardano's proof-of-stake consensus mechanism emphasizes sustainability and scalability, aligning with global environmental priorities. Recent developments include the Voltaire upgrade, enhancing decentralization and governance by granting ADA holders voting rights in platform decisions.Additionally, the introduction of the Chang Hard Fork has further empowered ADA holders with voting rights, strengthening the platform's governance framework. Despite these advancements, Cardano faces competition from emerging technologies like Lightchain AI, which integrates artificial intelligence with blockchain, potentially attracting broader adoption in the next market cycle. Nevertheless, Cardano's commitment to sustainable and scalable solutions continues to make it a significant contender in the blockchain space. Shiba Inu (SHIB) The Meme Coin with a Strong Community As of December 23, 2024, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is trading at approximately $0.00002156, reflecting a slight decrease of about 0.78% over the past 24 hours. Shiba Inu has garnered significant attention as a meme coin, bolstered by a passionate community and its increasing adoption as a payment method. Recent ventures into NFTs and metaverse projects have added utility to its ecosystem, enhancing its appeal beyond mere speculation. Notably, the Shiba Inu ecosystem has expanded through strategic partnerships and the development of decentralized applications, contributing to its growing prominence in the cryptocurrency space. Despite these advancements, Shiba Inu faces competition from emerging technologies like Lightchain AI, which integrates artificial intelligence with blockchain, offering real-world applications that may attract broader adoption in future market cycles. While SHIB thrives on community support, the innovative technology behind projects like Lightchain AI positions them for potential long-term growth beyond speculation. Pepe Coin (PEPE) An Emerging Meme Coin with Growing Popularity Pepe Coin (PEPE) has quickly gained traction among meme coin enthusiasts due to its viral branding and humor. However, as a speculative asset, PEPE faces challenges when compared to LCAI, which is backed by real-world applications and advanced AI technology. While PEPE benefits from meme coin momentum, LCAI‚Äôs focus on solving industry-specific problems gives it a technological edge and long-term value potential. This innovative approach could allow LCAI to outshine PEPE‚Äôs short-term hype and establish itself as a leader in the crypto space. Why LCAI Could Be Your Best Bet This Winter With its cutting-edge technology, real-world use cases, and deflationary tokenomics, Lightchain AI (LCAI) is positioned for significant growth in the coming months. As the AI market continues to expand and more industries adopt blockchain and AI-powered solutions, LCAI has the potential to experience exponential price gains, making it an attractive option for investors aiming to capitalize on the next crypto surge. Analysts predict that LCAI could skyrocket in value, with potential returns as high as 10,000% by 2025. Investing during the presale phase offers a unique opportunity to secure low entry prices, similar to the early days of Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL). Best Time to Buy Is Now With the crypto market constantly evolving, staying ahead of the game is key. As more investors shift focus towards altcoins like Lightchain AI (LCAI), prices are expected to rise. The best time to buy is now‚Äîduring its presale phase‚Äîbefore the surge begins, securing lower entry prices and positioning yourself for potential returns. Currently priced at just $0.003 during the presale, LCAI offers an excellent opportunity to get in early, ahead of its anticipated listing on exchanges where prices could spike. As the winter crypto surge approaches, having LCAI in your portfolio could position you for maximum gains.

38052994,https://finbold.com/?p=222544,1735051039,$20 billion wiped from XRP in a week,"Though it is undeniable XRP had an excellent run in November, and that it, despite the turbulence, retains much of the recent gains, it is equally clear that, last week, the token fell upon tough times. Specifically, after rallying 468% between election day and its recent peaks on December 3, XRP collapsed 19% by press time, reaching its December 24 price of $2.30. In the last seven days, the cryptocurrency market dynamics ensured the token diminished by about $20 billion as its market capitalization plunged from $152 billion to $132 billion. XRP market cap 7-day price chart. Source: CoinMarketCap The popular token‚Äôs downturn arguably can‚Äôt be pinned on the XRP community or any other event tied directly to the specific cryptocurrency. Instead, it is part of a greater bloodbath that heavily impacted digital ‚Äì and, to an extent, many other ‚Äì assets since the conclusion of the latest Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. Why XRP collapsed $20 billion in 7 days While the Fed announced the expected 25 basis points (BPS) interest rate cut, the remaining announcements raised the expected 2025 inflation from 2.1% to 2.5%, and the indices that there would be fewer rate reductions in the coming 12 months were received poorly. The immediate ‚Äì though somewhat tempered by press time ‚Äì $1.5 trillion stock market wipe and XRP‚Äôs $7 billion 24-hour bloodbath, reported by Finbold on December 19, demonstrate investor‚Äôs fear ignited with the inflationary warnings. Still, it is worth pointing out that the Federal Reserve can‚Äôt be blamed for all of the token‚Äôs recent struggles. Indeed, despite the $25 billion drop in the last seven days being, in many ways, shocking, XRP began stagnating several weeks earlier. Much like the bulk of the cryptocurrency market, the upward momentum appeared largely exhausted for the token by early December with trading remaining sideways since. Can 2025 renew the XRP rally? Finally, the relatively protracted stagnation and the more recent downturn do not guarantee that XRP can‚Äôt rebound into the New Year. The ‚ÄòSanta Claus rally‚Äô could still reignite the buying activity in 2024, and even if the prices remain relatively depressed by 2025, January is set to provide several external tailwinds. Two of the biggest anticipated developments come in the form of Donald Trump assuming the presidency ‚Äì the incoming Republican administration is widely expected to be unprecedently crypto-friendly ‚Äì and, on January 20, Gary Gensler is scheduled to step down as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chair. The controversial Chair‚Äôs departure is also expected to provide an opening for a swift and favorable resolution to Ripple Labs‚Äô long legal battle with the watchdog.

Bitcoin‚Äôs adoption as a strategic reserve asset among public companies has hit a fever pitch. Most recently, another notable firm has joined the mix.In a press release yesterday, Canada‚Äôs Matador disclosed that it would add Bitcoin to its balance sheet after a unanimous agreement by the Board of Directors. Notably, the company stated it would open the reserve account with a $4.5 million initial purchase.Matador Joins Bitcoin BandwagonMeanwhile, the initial December Bitcoin purchase will not be Matador's last. The company noted that it would periodically stack the asset in a measured buying program.Furthermore, Matador would move most of its cash balance from the Canadian dollar (CAD) to the US dollar (USD) to buy more Bitcoin. The firm would pursue the cause, firmly believing in Bitcoin‚Äôs dynamic qualities.Notably, the technology firm cited the growing economic uncertainties in Canada as a reason behind its decision. The company argued that it turned to the pioneering cryptocurrency to hedge against asset devaluation and decadence from growing national debt.Meanwhile, Matador‚Äôs Bitcoin embrace coincided with that of La Rosa, a real estate firm in the US and Puerto Rico. The firm announced that clients can now pay for properties to their agents in cryptocurrencies.Adoption Reaches a Fever PitchThe recent adoption upsurge has sparked fear of missing out (FOMO) among public firms that do not hold the asset, triggering pent-up exposure to Bitcoin. Moreover, stocks of firms that embraced Bitcoin have performed exceptionally, fueling further adoption.Companies like Rumble and Metaplanet have adopted Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, with the latter leveraging debt instruments to increase its stash. Notably, the bet has paid off as Metaplanet is on course to record its first operating profit in seven years.The FOMO has also reached the international level.

Investors, particularly those in altcoins and memecoins , have shifted from bullish optimism to bearish caution. Declining market caps have led to a reduced appetite for riskier assets, with attention refocusing on Bitcoin. While the current fear and uncertainty dominate discussions, seasoned traders recognize this phase as an opportunity to capitalize on the ‚Äúblood in the streets‚Äù cycle that often signals a bottom.

38052722,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=666706,1735050656,Solana Recovery Momentum Set The Stage For $194 Resistance Breakout,"Recent trading activities reveal that Solana (SOL) is showing signs of renewed strength as its price stages a notable recovery. After enduring a period of bearish dominance, SOL has found support at $164, sparking optimism among market participants. Currently, the cryptocurrency is approaching the critical $194 resistance level, a pivotal barrier that could determine the next phase of its trajectory. This recovery highlights the resilience of Solana‚Äôs bulls, who appear ready to reclaim control and push the price higher. However, the journey to surpass $194 is far from straightforward. Historical data reveals this level as a significant hurdle, where sellers have often mounted strong defenses. A successful breakout above $194 could signal a resurgence of bullish momentum, potentially propelling SOL toward new highs and reinforcing confidence in its long-term prospects. Solana Resilience Amidst Waning Market Condition The $164 level has proven to be a critical support zone for Solana, acting as a safety net against further declines. Historically, this level has facilitated strong buying pressure, signaling that bulls are vigorously defending this zone. Its ability to hold firm during recent market turbulence underscores its importance in SOL‚Äôs recovery narrative. Related Reading: Solana Price Continues Downward Slide ‚Äî Is A Rebound Possible At $180? Additionally, the $137 level has emerged as another significant area of interest. Though the price has not revisited this mark in recent trading sessions, its historical role as a bounce-back point for SOL cannot be overlooked. The convergence of multiple support zones has created a robust foundation, enabling the asset to stabilize and regain momentum. Bullish Indicators Supporting Recovery Several technical indicators are aligning to suggest a potential continuation of upward momentum: Composite Trend Oscillator: Both the signal line and the SMA of this indicator are gradually climbing out of oversold territory, reflecting an increase in buying pressure and a shift toward positive sentiment. 100-Day Simple Moving Average (SMA): The price is approaching this key moving average, signaling a possible shift in the medium-term momentum. A successful breach above this level could solidify the recovery trend. Volume Profile: Trading volumes near the $185 support level have shown a significant uptick, indicating renewed interest among buyers and the possibility of sustained upward strength. In conclusion, SOL‚Äôs recovery from key support levels is a testament to the asset‚Äôs resilience in the face of adversity. If the bulls capitalize on this momentum and push the price beyond the $194 resistance, it could signal the start of a broader bullish rally, as the price will move to challenge the $209 resistance. Related Reading: Solana Holds Weekly Support At $180 ‚Äì Analyst Expects $330 Mid-Term Conversely, If bearish action strengthens, Solana might face increased selling pressure, possibly pulling its price to the $164 support zone. A clear break below this critical threshold may pave the way for further declines, with the next significant support level situated at $137.

38053257,https://blockworks.co/news/5-crypto-predictions-for-2025,1735050600,5 crypto predictions for 2025,"This is a segment from the Empire newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . In the mid-16th century, Nostradamus made 942 predictions in eight years. He‚Äôd supposedly dictated every one as a poem to his secretary. All while hallucinating on heroic doses of nutmeg. Sadly, I don‚Äôt have a secretary. But why should that stop me? Here are five crypto prophecies that will totally come true in 2025. And if not, they can easily be rehashed for hundreds of years, just like Nostradamus‚Äôs. AI chatbots will gamify flash loan attacks. We rarely hear about flash loan attacks anymore. Apparently, the US Department of Justice largely put a stop to them after they nabbed Avi ‚Äúit‚Äôs just a profitable trading strategy‚Äù Eisenberg last year. That is until some diabolical edgelord trains an AI model to trawl the dingiest illiquid corners of DeFi for potential targets. After all, who‚Äôs to blame: The prompt engineer or the LLM with a crypto wallet? Either a bitcoin ETF or a nation-state will be hacked Never mind that most ETFs have abstracted the actual handling of coins far away from their own liability ‚Äî presumably replaced by a WhatsApp chat with a Coinbase Custody support representative. Next year will mark a return of monumental crypto hacks. It‚Äôs indeed been a while since we saw one. Maybe the Ronin hack was the last hack that really, really hurt. Be on the lookout for a nation-state or ETF issuer to fumble the bag, perhaps by falling for a North Korean phishing email for a phony Chick-fil-A coupon. The FTC will sue a memecoin You‚Äôve probably heard that the next SEC chair should be more friendly to crypto. But that‚Äôs just the SEC. There are still more than a dozen US agencies that could probably still pull some real boomer moves next year. Enter the Federal Trade Commission. They‚Äôve gone after crypto companies in the past, including Celsius and Voyager, and also pushed federal cases against fraudsters peddling fake investment schemes. I‚Äôd watch for the FTC to characterize a random memecoin as such and start suing. Gensler is leaving a void that only another short-sighted regulator can fill. Crypto lotteries will emerge as public goods Crypto already has its own pseudo-lottery systems: memecoins. If you‚Äôre really into buying Powerball and Mega Millions, why not buy a random pump.fun memecoin every week and hope to one day strike it big (as long as you can time the top). So, it‚Äôs about time someone ‚Äî perhaps from the very public-good-centric Ethereum space ‚Äî codes an unstoppable permissionless crypto lottery that pays out once a week. And before you point out that random number generators on the blockchain are always a bad idea, study lava lamps . IRL livestreamers will adopt prediction markets To suggest that livestreamers like Speed and KSI would mint their own memecoins (or would they be social tokens?) is too obvious. Calling it now: A major streamer will figure out how to utilize prediction markets to crowdsource their content. Case in point: Speed‚Äôs suggestion that he‚Äôll run sprints at the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles could be a prediction market. And all his viewers could bet whether that‚Äôs the case ‚Äî or push him toward any other challenge for that matter. Mass adoption through Twitch starts in 2025.

The decision follows the exchange‚Äôs comprehensive review of BTG under its Digital Asset Transaction Support Termination Policy. Transparency Concerns Upbit initially flagged Bitcoin Gold as a cautionary item for trading on December 10. The exchange cited concerns over the transparency of its operations and the sustainability of the project. Upbit said there is a lack of progress in resolving these issues. Termination of Market Support for Bitcoin Gold(BTG) Termination Schedule: 23th January 2025 14:30 PM (KST) https://t.co/BOGeQ8K9Al ‚Äî Upbit Korea (@Official_Upbit) December 24, 2024 After further evaluation, Upbit determined that the concerns remained unresolved and decided to delist BTG in line with its policies on maintaining trading best practices. Upbit Warns Users Take Action Before Termination Date Following the delisting, all buy and sell orders for BTG in the market will be automatically cancelled. Users are advised to take action before the termination date to manage their holdings. Upbit clarified that it will no longer support services related to Bitcoin Gold, such as wallet upgrades, airdrops, or hard forks, after the delisting. What is Bitcoin Gold? Bitcoin Gold, a fork of Bitcoin aimed at decentralizing mining by adopting a GPU-friendly proof-of-work algorithm, has faced challenges in maintaining its relevance and credibility in the competitive crypto landscape. The delisting of Bitcoin Gold shows the growing scrutiny that cryptocurrency exchanges are placing on digital assets to maintain compliance and safeguard investor interests. Price Action Following the Upbit announcement on Tuesday, BTG was trading down 7.9% at $15.60.

38052961,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=632741,1735050494,MicroStrategy plans shareholder vote to sell more shares and stack more Bitcoins,"MicroStrategy is getting ready for an important shareholder vote to decide if the company can raise more money to support its big Bitcoin plans. The company wants to raise $42 billion over the next three years to strengthen its position as a leader in using Bitcoin. MicroStrategy is set up for an important shareholder vote. It announced a meeting with its shareholders after purchasing $516 million worth of Bitcoins. The meeting is to decide if the company can raise funds for its big Bitcoin Strategy plan, called the ‚Äú 21/21 Plan .‚Äù The plan is to raise $21 billion by equity financing and another $21 billion by issuing bonds over the next three years. MicroStrategy SEC filing. Source: X MicroStrategy‚Äôs 21/21 plan The company started its Bitcoin journey in 2020 when it made the cryptocurrency a key part of its treasury strategy. Since then, MicroStrategy has accumulated over 444,000 BTC, worth $42 billion. This shift has increased the company‚Äôs market value gradually, growing it from $1.1 billion to $82 billion. To achieve its goals, the company has proposed increasing the number of authorized Class A shares from 330 million to 10.33 billion and also raising the number of preferred shares from 5 million to 1.05 billion. These changes will allow greater flexibility to raise funds. The company has also proposed changes to its 2023 Equity Incentive Plan, by introducing automatic equity awards for newly appointed directors to align them with its Bitcoin-focused vision. Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy‚Äôs executive chairman, has been the main force behind its Bitcoin strategy. He believes this approach is essential for long-term success. Under his leadership, the company has remained committed to Bitcoin, even during periods of market decline and rise. Most recently, MicroStrategy sold $561 million worth of shares to acquire an additional 5,262 BTC, showing its strong trust in Bitcoin as a safe option to hold value. Investor concerns The proposals have gotten mixed reactions from investors. While some point out the big profits made from the Bitcoin plan, such as a 477% rise in the company‚Äôs stock price over the past year, others are cautious about potential risks. A concern is that issuing more shares may reduce the percentage of current shareholders, which is raising questions about how the company will balance long-term goals with the interests of its investors. Those who support the plan believe that the Bitcoin strategy has already made MicroStrategy more valuable and helped it to lead the way in corporate use of Bitcoin. They think the changes will help the company‚Äôs future opportunities and stay at the top of the Bitcoin world. There is also concern about the company crumbling into bankruptcy because of Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility. But the point is we may never see that scenario as Young said that MicroStrategy could only face bankruptcy if Bitcoin‚Äôs price falls to $16,500. He also pointed out that the company is holding around $46 billion worth of Bitcoin, but there is only $7 billion in debt. So it‚Äôs impossible to get into bankruptcy as some are concerned. Despite these, Michael Saylor also suggested that a Bitcoin reserve could help the US with its huge national debt. He thinks the current political environment is also cordial with the Bitcoin agenda. As the US develops into a pro-crypto industrial environment, he strongly believes that there will be more regulations to help MicroStrategy achieve its goals and a Bitcoin reserve would be a great launchpad. The upcoming vote will be an important moment for MicroStrategy. If the shareholders approve the plan, the company will get the resources to carry out its 21/21 plan.

38052666,https://crypto.news/?p=14321926,1735050469,Bitget Token soars as key indicators send a major warning,"The Bitget Token price continued soaring this week even as the Santa Claus rally in the crypto industry remained elusive. Bitget Token ( BGB ) jumped to a high of $4.97, meaning that it has soared by over 470% from its lowest level this year. It is unclear why this surge has happened, but it is likely because of its growing market share in the crypto industry. CoinGecko data shows that it has become the eighth biggest exchange in the industry, handling over $91 billion in volume last month. On-chain data shows that the BGB price surge has attracted some Fear of Missing Out as the number of active addresses rose. Its 30-day active addresses rose to almost 200, up from less than 100 in October. BGB active addresses | Source: Santiment You might also like: Exchange tokens Bitget, and Cronos surge as BNB price lags Bitget Token price MVRV indicator soars There are a few reasons why the BGB price may retreat in the coming days. First, there are signs that it has moved into the markup phase of the Wyckoff Method. This phase comes after a long period of accumulation, which, in this case, lasted over two years. It is usually characterized by higher supply than demand and is followed by distribution and markdown. Second, data by IntoTheBlock shows that the market value to realized value has soared to 9.83, a record high. This is a popular indicator that compares a cryptocurrency‚Äôs market value and its realized value and then finds its standard deviation. As we wrote on Bitcoin , an asset is said to be in the overbought zone when the MVRV indicator moves above 3.8. In BGB‚Äôs case, this figure has moved to 9.83, meaning that it has become extremely overbought, which could lead to a pullback. BGB MVRV indicator | Source: IntoTheBlock BGB is overbought, and mean reversion is possible BGB price chart | Source: crypto.news Meanwhile, the BGB price could retreat because the coin has become highly overbought. The Relative Strength Index has moved to the extreme overbought level of 82, while the two lines of the Stochastic Oscillator are nearing 100. On top of this, it remains much higher than the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages. It is about 88% higher than the 50-day MA, meaning that the concept of mean reversion could come in. This is a concept where an asset often drops to the moving average after deviating for so long. This is a notable thing since the standard deviation has jumped to the highest level this year. Therefore, as we have seen with other popular coins that went parabolic, like Ripple and Stellar, there is a likelihood that they will suffer a harsh reversal soon as investors take profits.

The Vote-to-Earn model gives the community real power, allowing them to shape the project‚Äôs future and even get paid for it. They can also earn via staking rewards, providing a double-whammy for those seeking an alternative to the usual ‚Äúquick flip‚Äù trading strategy of meme coins. But as Flockerz ticks off presale milestones, the ICO price is gradually increasing. Now is the time to act for those who want the most value for money. The current price is $0.006504, but the next increase will occur in just one day. Vote-to-earn, Staking Rewards Are Big Business For Meme Coin Fans The Flockerz presale is seeing strong growth for one main reason ‚Äì it puts the community first. One way it‚Äôs doing this is through FlockTopia, its Vote-to-Earn decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). $FLOCK holders get to vote on all key decisions relating to the project‚Äôs future, including ecosystem developments, marketing strategies, and even which projects to partner with. It‚Äôs a way to ensure that holders feel connected to the project, which could lead to more loyalty and long-term holding. But beyond that, the FlockTopia Vote-to-Earn system will increase ecosystem participation by paying people to vote. This ability to earn free crypto could also sway prospective buyers to purchase $FLOCK over a different meme coin. Flockerz‚Äôs staking mechanism also helps with this. Users can lock up their $FLOCK tokens in the project‚Äôs staking contract for passive rewards. It currently offers a 364% APY, but this will decrease over time. Most meme coins are centered around a meme‚Äôs virality and comedic value. Flockerz has that, but it also has tangible utility, which primes it for increased demand and community loyalty. Flockerz Presale Shows Huge Demand, Next Binance Listing? The industry‚Äôs top players are interested in Flockerz ‚Äì interest is building among whales and smart money traders. Could this result in a listing on Binance or another top exchange? For instance, prominent trader ClayBro recently told his 130K YouTube subscribers that Flockerz is ‚Äúquickly becoming a top meme coin to buy now.‚Äù ClayBro is highly bullish on the entire meme coin sector, speculating that ‚Äúwe are going to see a trillion-dollar meme coin supercycle.‚Äù However, amidst his euphoric analyses, ClayBro suggests that Flockerz‚Äôs innovative Vote-to-Earn governance system could make it one of the best performers. It‚Äôs clear that ClayBro is not the only one who thinks this way, with the project‚Äôs total raise ballooning. In preparation for the meme coin supercycle, top centralized exchanges like Binance and Coinbase continue to list new meme coins for trading. Recently, Binance listed Pudgy Penguins and Simon‚Äôs Cat. Meanwhile, Coinbase listed has listed Mog Coin, GigaChad, and Turbo. Right now, Flockerz is going from strength to strength. It remains to be seen whether a top exchange like Coinbase or Binance will list it, but there‚Äôs no doubt that they‚Äôre watching closely. Buy $FLOCK At The Lowest Price Before Bull Market Rally The crypto market has took a breath in December after meteoric growth in November. This marks a period where traders can regroup and position for the next leg of the bull market, which is expected to continue throughout 2025. While most cryptos have already pumped in the bull market, the Flockerz presale presents an opportunity to join a high-potential project from the ground floor. Investors can buy $FLOCK via the project‚Äôs website or using the Best Wallet app‚Äôs Upcoming Tokens feature. Flockerz has been audited by Coinsult and Solid Proof , with both firms finding no issues with its code.

These tokens were acquired at $169.60 two months ago, and the sale would have netted a profit of $313,000. Currently, the whale still holds 50% of their original position, amounting to 25,000 $SOL, with an unrealized profit of $310,000.

Trend-based FIB levels support the short-term retracement, targeting a retest of $4.20 (38.29% FIB level). Nonetheless, solid barriers at local support zones and the strengthening demand, according to TVL, hint at possible rallies toward $5. Moreover, the ascending channel setup indicates potential upswings towards the upper border at $5.71 (78.60% FIB mark).

The project is ushering in a new era for meme coins, delivering real utility while riding the viral allure of Pepe coin and Jordan Belfort. Investors can buy $WEPE today at a price of $0.0003653, but this will rise throughout the ICO. The next increase will occur later today. Meme Coins With Die-hard Believers Can 200x Murad Mahmudov, an infamous meme coin trader known for his ‚Äúmeme coin supercycle‚Äù thesis, has told investors that the best way to profit from meme coins is to buy long-term and not overtrade.

38056115,https://invezz.com/?p=2403368,1735049400,Philippine SEC proposes strict new rules for crypto service providers,"The Philippine Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has unveiled a draft of its proposed ‚ÄúSEC Rules on Crypto-Assets Service Providers (CASP Rules),‚Äù aimed at regulating the country‚Äôs booming cryptocurrency sector. This initiative seeks to mitigate risks such as fraud, money laundering, and market manipulation, while also fostering innovation in a sector attracting over 562 million users globally. Public consultations on the draft rules are open until January 18, 2025, giving stakeholders ample time to provide their input and help shape the future of cryptocurrency regulation in the Philippines. The Philippines, with its young and digitally savvy population, has become a significant player in cryptocurrency adoption. The new regulatory framework represents a critical step in addressing challenges and opportunities as the nation continues to emerge as a crypto hub. Comprehensive regulations for trading, custody, and public offerings The SEC‚Äôs draft rules establish a robust framework that includes licensing and compliance requirements for crypto-asset service providers. The proposal categorises crypto-assets as digital representations of value leveraging distributed ledger technology and seeks to regulate activities such as trading, custody, and public offerings. Under the draft rules, service providers must secure SEC registration and adhere to the Financial Products and Services Consumer Protection Act (FCPA). The regulations set out stringent conditions, including minimum capital requirements and operational standards to ensure the stability and transparency of the sector. Entities planning public offerings of crypto-assets are required to submit detailed disclosure documents to the SEC at least 30 days before launching marketing activities. These documents must include comprehensive details about the issuer‚Äôs profile, the underlying technology, associated risks, and clear warnings about the possibility of value loss. This measure aims to ensure transparency and protect investors from misinformation. The SEC also introduces provisions to address cybersecurity threats and bolster consumer trust. Service providers will need to align with the National Cybersecurity Plan, undergo regular system audits, and implement robust anti-money laundering (AML) measures. Insider trading and market manipulation are explicitly targeted in the draft framework, ensuring a level playing field for all participants. Public consultation as a key step towards regulation The SEC‚Äôs public call for feedback underscores its commitment to a collaborative regulatory process. Stakeholders, including industry leaders, technology experts, and legal professionals, have until January 18, 2025, to submit their comments on the proposed rules, ensuring a wide range of perspectives are considered. This initiative reflects the Philippine SEC‚Äôs broader objective of balancing innovation with consumer protection. While the regulations aim to mitigate risks associated with the cryptocurrency sector, they also seek to establish the Philippines as a leader in the global digital economy. The development of a comprehensive framework for crypto-asset service providers highlights the country‚Äôs proactive approach in navigating the evolving digital financial landscape. If implemented effectively, the CASP Rules could enhance investor confidence, attract more players to the market, and position the Philippines as a model for crypto regulation in Southeast Asia.

JasmyCoin (JASMY) JasmyCoin (JASMY) is a cryptocurrency developed by Jasmy Corporation, an Internet of Things (IoT) provider based in Tokyo. The Jasmy platform aims to restore and protect individual data sovereignty by integrating IoT technology with blockchain. It connects service providers and data users, allowing users full control over their personal information. The platform enables secure data exchange between IoT devices such as computers, cars, and phones, and decentralized protocols. By utilizing edge computing and storing data on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), Jasmy decentralizes data workflow, ensuring data is securely protected and owned by individuals. Service providers can access user-owned data to promote their services while respecting data ownership. Jasmy provides a powerful infrastructure, intuitive interface, and a secure environment for storing and sharing data, transforming information into personal assets. In the current market cycle, JasmyCoin‚Äôs focus on data sovereignty and secure IoT integration may appeal to those interested in blockchain solutions for data privacy and security. Kaspa (KAS) Kaspa (KAS) is a proof-of-work cryptocurrency that implements the GHOSTDAG protocol. Unlike traditional blockchains, Kaspa‚Äôs GHOSTDAG allows multiple blocks created in parallel to coexist and orders them in consensus, forming a blockDAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) instead of a single chain. This enables the network to handle high block rates, currently achieving one block per second with goals to increase to 10 and eventually 100 blocks per second. Kaspa includes features like Reachability for querying the DAG‚Äôs topology, block data pruning, SPV proofs, and planned subnetwork support to facilitate future layer 2 solutions. Kaspa‚Äôs technology aims to address scalability issues in proof-of-work cryptocurrencies by enabling rapid block generation and confirmation times primarily influenced by internet latency. The use of blockDAG and GHOSTDAG protocol enhances network throughput while maintaining security. This novel approach presents potential for increased scalability and efficiency in the cryptocurrency space. The attractiveness of KAS in the current market cycle depends on various factors, including market conditions and technological adoption. Kaspa‚Äôs focus on high-speed transactions and scalability may be of interest to those monitoring advancements in blockchain technology. TRON (TRX) TRON (TRX) is a decentralized blockchain-based operating system developed by the Tron Foundation and launched in 2017. Initially, TRX tokens were ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum network, but in 2018 they moved to their own blockchain. The platform was created to give full ownership rights to digital content creators. It aims to help content makers receive more rewards by allowing consumers to compensate them directly, without intermediaries like YouTube or Facebook. TRON supports smart contracts, various blockchain systems, and decentralized applications (dApps). It uses a transaction model similar to Bitcoin, with transactions recorded on a public ledger. The platform enables developers to create dApps and share content openly without concerns about transaction fees. As an alternative to Ethereum, TRON offers tools for building a decentralized Internet. In the current market cycle, TRON‚Äôs focus on empowering content creators and its robust platform for dApps may make it an attractive option for users and developers interested in decentralized technologies. Conclusion JASMY, KAS, TRX, and SHIB are good picks, but XYZVerse (XYZ), the first all-sport memecoin, aims for 20,000% growth with a community-driven ecosystem.

Dogen, an emerging name in the crypto world, is attracting investors with its potential for massive growth. This trend could herald significant changes in the cryptocurrency market . DOGEN Rejoys Big Moment: Trump‚Äôs Victory Will Send It to the Moon Guess who is going to join Elon Musk‚Äôs moon mission soon? DOGEN, the boldest meme coin for alpha males, is gearing up for take-off as Trump‚Äôs victory in the recent US election has the entire market euphoric about the prospects of cryptocurrencies, especially meme coins. Donald and Elon are Best Buddies for Meme Coins Donald Trump‚Äôs love for crypto is no secret ‚Äî he‚Äôs promised to make the U.S. the global crypto leader in his campaign. And joining him is none other than Elon Musk , the ultimate Dogecoin (DOGE) fan who‚Äôs backed the crypto movement and even aligned with Republicans earlier this year.

DOGEN will be the Next Star with 500% Surge Following the US election results, Dogecoin (DOGE) has been on a steady rise: from $0.15 to $0.39 in just one week . DOGEN follows the same upward trend, starting at $0.0003 and now trading at $0.0013, a staggering 333% leap . With a total of 13 presale stages, DOGEN is set to rise to $0.0019 by the token generation event (TGE), which represents a 500% increase from its initial price. Like it DOGE style?

Flex Hard, Earn Big ‚Äì DOGEN is Your Power Move! AVAX Targets $59 Resistance as Altcoin Season Approaches Avalanche (AVAX) may be gearing up for a price surge after recent corrections. Despite a -28.84% drop in the last week, the coin has gained over 42% in the past 6 months, showing strong long-term potential. Technical indicators like RSI at 41.32 and Stochastic at 33.72 suggest that AVAX is nearing oversold levels, which could lead to increased buying interest. The price is close to the 10-day simple moving average of $36.59, and a break above the nearest resistance at $59 could signal a robust uptrend. If momentum continues, AVAX might target the second resistance at $77.40, offering significant upside from current levels. With altcoin season on the horizon, AVAX could be set for impressive growth. Chainlink Poised for Breakout Amid Bullish Market Signals Chainlink is showing promising signs in the market. Despite a recent weekly dip of over 23%, the coin has seen a strong monthly increase and an impressive rise over the past six months. The current price is close to its short-term and long-term moving averages, indicating potential stability before a move. The Relative Strength Index is around the middle range, suggesting the coin is neither overbought nor oversold. If Chainlink can surpass the nearest resistance level at $35, it may aim for the next resistance at $46, potentially doubling from current levels. These factors suggest a possible upward trend in the near future. Conclusion AVAX and LINK show less short-term potential, leading investors to DOGEN. This meme token for those seeking luxury and success expects 700% growth by presale‚Äôs end, with potential for huge returns this altcoin season. Following tokens like BONK and Popcat, DOGEN builds a community of alpha leaders, offering real benefits and perks for early adopters.

This marks a 40% increase compared to the $1.69 billion lost to hackers in 2023. These numbers underscore the vulnerabilities that continue to plague the industry, raising concerns about its ability to achieve mainstream adoption. The surge in attacks comes amidst a backdrop of rising cryptocurrency valuations, with Bitcoin crossing the $100,000 milestone for the first time on December 6. While 2024‚Äôs losses are staggering, they remain below the record $3.78 billion stolen in 2022. This discrepancy suggests that while the frequency of attacks has grown, the scale of individual breaches may have reduced slightly, reflecting some progress in mitigating vulnerabilities in specific areas. Along with financial losses, the reputational impact on platforms and projects has been severe, with trust in the ecosystem shaken. This growing wave of cybercrime highlights an urgent need for comprehensive regulatory frameworks and more transparent security protocols to restore investor confidence. Centralised exchanges and custodians lead in vulnerabilities Access control breaches emerged as the leading cause of losses, accounting for $1.9 billion, or 81% of the total stolen in 2024. Centralised exchanges (CEXs) and crypto custodians were hit hardest, with compromised private keys and weak key management systems being common points of failure. High-profile hacks involving multi-signature wallets demonstrated the severity of these security lapses. Experts warn that without significant improvements in key management and the implementation of robust offline storage solutions, such incidents are likely to persist. Smart contract exploits also contributed significantly, resulting in $456 million worth of assets being stolen across 98 incidents. These breaches highlight the challenges posed by decentralised finance (DeFi) platforms, where vulnerabilities in code remain a primary risk factor. Industry faces an urgent call for enhanced security The industry‚Äôs reliance on emerging technologies and decentralised frameworks has created a fertile ground for cybercriminals. To counter this growing threat, experts are urging the adoption of advanced security measures. Real-time threat monitoring, robust private key management, and collaboration across the sector are seen as critical steps to safeguard digital assets. The rising appeal of cryptocurrencies has made them a prime target for cybercriminals. The industry must now act decisively to strengthen its infrastructure. Innovations in cybersecurity, combined with a focus on education and collaboration, could pave the way for a safer Web3 environment in the coming years. As cryptocurrency valuations continue to rise, the onus is on the industry to ensure that its growth is not undermined by persistent vulnerabilities. Fostering public-private partnerships could provide the resources and expertise necessary to combat sophisticated hacking efforts. Collaboration among regulators, technology providers, and financial institutions is vital to develop a holistic approach to combating cyber threats.

In a post on the social media platform X, Kiyosaki addressed the concerns of Bitcoin investors who are lamenting its falling value. ‚ÄúBoo Hoo Boo Hoo: BITCOIN CRY BABIES crying about Bitcoin prices dropping down. Rather than say ‚ÄòThank you‚Äô and buying more ‚ÄòBitcoins‚Äô‚Ä¶..cry babies cry,‚Äù Kiyosaki wrote. ‚ÄúBuy buy buy not cry cry cry.

Biggest problem are our leaders and educators. As I have often asked ‚ÄúWhat did school teach you about money?‚Äù Regardless of‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) December 23, 2024 His message was clear: instead of panicking over Bitcoin‚Äôs price fluctuations, investors should take advantage of the current market conditions to increase their holdings. The author, a long-time Bitcoin advocate, has frequently touted the crypto as a hedge against inflation, severally calling it ‚Äúdigital gold.‚Äù Kiyosaki‚Äôs unyielding optimism for Bitcoin despite recent setbacks Earlier this year, Kiyosaki made headlines by forecasting that Bitcoin will reach $1 million by 2030, driven by the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). Despite the ambitious nature of his claim, his optimism has not been tempered by the cryptocurrency‚Äôs failure to meet his earlier projections. In 2023, Kiyosaki predicted that Bitcoin would surpass $350,000 by August, a forecast that did not materialize. Nonetheless, he remains confident in Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term potential, insisting that market corrections and price fluctuations are part of the asset‚Äôs inherent volatility. He praised Bitcoin‚Äôs design, which he believes is ‚Äúdesigned to make everyone rich,‚Äù even for those who have entered the market late. ‚ÄúIt is never too late to start‚Ä¶regardless of how high Bitcoin price goes,‚Äù Kiyosaki stated when Bitcoin was trading above $100,000 last week.

Hang on to your job and your money,‚Äù Kiyosaki urged. ‚ÄúFor many people, crashes are the best times to get rich. I plan on getting richer. I want you to get richer and smarter, too.‚Äù This rhetoric is consistent with Kiyosaki‚Äôs long-standing view that fiat currencies, especially the US dollar, are subject to inflation and loss of value. While Kiyosaki‚Äôs message remains one of optimism, he has also cautioned his followers not to get too greedy in their Bitcoin investments. Despite his advice to buy the dip, he urged restraint, saying, ‚ÄúJust don‚Äôt get greedy.‚Äù Bitcoin price mirrors market weakness Bitcoin‚Äôs recent struggles highlight the broader challenges facing the cryptocurrency market, with significant volatility and institutional caution playing a role in the asset‚Äôs current state. The ongoing bearish trend has led many to reassess their positions, At press time, Bitcoin is trading at $93,990, having lost the key $94,000 support level. This drop has contributed to a wave of market-wide crypto liquidations totaling $242.21 million, according to Coinglass data . Notably, the split between long and short liquidations has narrowed, with long-side liquidations totaling $128.98 million and short-side liquidations accounting for $113.28 million. The market has been marked by a lack of institutional support for Bitcoin, as evidenced by the daily net outflow for US spot Bitcoin ETFs, which remains at $226.56 million. While BlackRock has continued to buy into Bitcoin with an inflow of $31.66 million, other major players, such as Fidelity, have seen significant outflows, including $145.97 million in redemptions.

As a result, these levels have become one of the pivotal levels to secure that could pave the way for the price to reclaim $100K at the earliest. While the technicals do not suggest a quick rebound, the bullish market sentiments suggest the price is expected to revive a strong rebound in a short while from now. The short-term price action of Bitcoin displays a constant formation of lower lows and highs that indicates the growing strength of bears.The price has also broken down from the rising parallel channel, which validates bearish claims. However, after displaying a fake breakout, the price may trap the bears at the lows as a major trend reversal is about to be stabilized as market participants continue to accumulate instead of panic selling. As per the Glassnode data shared by analyst Ali , the rise in the accumulation trend score suggests a strong buying interest among the market participants. The levels have been on constant rise since the November breakout; however, the recent sell-off has sparked some distribution. However, the levels remain within the bullish range and hence a rebound seems to be imminent. What‚Äôs next? Will BTC price Reclaim $100K Before the End of 2024? Although the BTC price has broken down from the bullish range, the token continues to trade within a bullish range. This indicates a flip could be on the horizon as the bulls are defending the support at $92,100 firmly for over a month. Now that the token has approached the last few days of the year, the bulls are expected to gain a huge dominance and revive a strong upswing soon. As seen in the above chart, the BTC price has broken the support of the rising parallel channel, which has circulated bearish waves. Even though the buying volume over the token remains around the average range, the impact of this is not seen as the price remains within the restrictive range. Besides, the DMI seems to be heading for a bearish crossover with the ADX heading towards the lower ranges. Additionally, the OBV, the balance-based indicator, maintains a consolidated descending trend, suggesting the trend is slowly shifting from bullish to bearish. The technicals suggest a pullback to the support at $92,000 at the moment, and if it rebound from this range, the BTC price may reclaim $100K; otherwise, a drop below $90,000 could be imminent.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bitcoin-struggles-to-reclaim-100k-market-sentiments-remain-extremely-bullish-will-it-mark-a-new-ath-at-110k/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

However, the token has since fallen sharply, hovering close to its original cost price of $3.64. Adding to the pressure, EigenLayer is scheduled to unlock $4.83 million worth of $EIGEN tokens (0.61% of total supply) on December 24. This event could introduce additional selling pressure, a common trend with newly launched tokens like $EIGEN, $ENA, and $MOCA. Investors should closely monitor this timeline as post-unlock periods often see increased volatility and significant price drops. That said, it‚Äôs worth noting that not all token unlocks result in declines. Some market makers have previously managed to defy expectations and sustain or even push prices higher, as seen with $APT. For now, $EIGEN holders should brace for potential turbulence while keeping an eye on market activity during the token unlock period. Understanding market dynamics and whale behavior remains crucial for navigating this highly volatile asset. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

38051190,https://thecoinrise.com/new-crypto-scam-baits-opportunists-with-seed-phrase-trap/,1735047916,New Crypto Scam Baits Opportunists with Seed Phrase Trap,"A new crypto scam has emerged, targeting opportunistic users who attempt to raid cryptocurrency wallets with exposed seed phrases. According to cybersecurity firm Kaspersky, scammers are posing as naive crypto users by posting seed phrases in YouTube comments, luring victims into a cleverly orchestrated trap. In a December 23 blog post , Kaspersky analyst Mikhail Sytnik detailed the scheme. Comments left on finance-related videos often appear as innocent queries about transferring Tether (USDT) between wallets. These comments include seed phrases to a bait wallet containing $8,000 in USDT on the Tron network. The catch? To access the funds, an opportunist must first deposit a small amount of TRON (TRX), the network‚Äôs native token, to cover transaction fees. However, any TRX sent to the bait wallet is immediately rerouted to another wallet controlled by the scammers. Multisignature Wallets Add to the Trap What makes this scam particularly deceptive is the bait wallet‚Äôs configuration as a multisignature wallet. These wallets require approvals from multiple parties for outgoing transactions. Even after paying the transaction fees, would-be thieves find themselves unable to move the USDT, as they lack the necessary approvals. ‚ÄúThis scheme essentially flips the script,‚Äù Sytnik explained. ‚ÄúScammers are targeting other scammers in a digital Robin Hood-like fashion, exploiting their greed for personal gain.‚Äù This isn‚Äôt the first time crypto scams have turned on each other. In July, Kaspersky uncovered a more elaborate operation that lured victims via Telegram links leading to legitimate crypto exchanges . The trap included files that, when accessed, installed malware designed to siphon off data and digital assets. Rising Crypto Scam Cases Kaspersky‚Äôs Sytnik advised users to steer clear of accessing others‚Äô crypto wallets, even if offered a seed phrase. ‚ÄúThe risks far outweigh the potential rewards,‚Äù he cautioned. He also urged crypto enthusiasts to remain skeptical of strangers‚Äô claims online, particularly those involving too-good-to-be-true opportunities. This serves as a stark reminder of the ever-evolving scam tactics in the crypto space , where greed often meets ingenuity. As Sytnik concluded, staying vigilant and ethical is the best defense against falling victim to these schemes.

Daddy Pepe (DADDPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 11,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DADDPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Daddy Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Daddy Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Daddy Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.

The chart shared by CryptoBull suggests that XRP is positioned for a significant breakout. Is XRP About to Surge? The chart displays a symmetrical triangle pattern on the daily time frame, formed after XRP reached its recent high of $2.86. This price action indicates a period of consolidation, which often precedes a breakout. According to the post, the asset has hit its bottom, and CryptoBull expects it to experience two more weeks of consolidation before achieving a new all-time high. A symmetrical triangle is a continuation pattern that reflects indecision among investors. In XRP‚Äôs case, the price is compressing between converging trendlines, signaling that a decisive move is imminent. This could either go upward or downward. However, CryptoBull anticipates an upward move, and many other analysts share this sentiment . The critical support level identified on the chart lies around $1.96, XRP‚Äôs 2021 peak it surpassed in early December. This level will prevent further losses if the asset dips below $2. The two-week timeline places the date for the new all-time high at January 5, 2025, potentially giving XRP investors a significant New Year present.

The digital asset peaked at $2.86 earlier this month, marking its highest value since 2018. This milestone has reignited discussions about its long-term potential and ability to reclaim its position among the top-performing cryptocurrencies. The technical analysis aligns with broader expectations for XRP, especially as regulatory uncertainties surrounding Ripple, its parent company, appear to be easing. Although not directly mentioned in the post, industry developments, such as Gary Gensler‚Äôs resignation as SEC Chair effective January 2025 and Paul Atkins‚Äô nomination as his successor, are positive for XRP and the broader market. XRP‚Äôs recent price action and the formation of a symmetrical triangle pattern highlight its potential for a significant move in the near term.

Source: Finbold A review of on-chain metrics shared by prominent analyst Ali Martinez on December 24 indicates that XRP whales acquired 40 million tokens within 24 hours. XRP whale transaction chart.

For instance, as reported by Finbold on December 19, XRP recorded a $7 billion outflow in capital in a single day, mirroring the general market trend. XRP price prediction If history repeats itself, XRP could be gearing up for a potential upward move, as large-scale accumulation by whales has often preceded price growth. Regarding potential price action, Finbold turned to OpenAI‚Äôs artificial intelligence (AI) tool, ChatGPT-4o , for insights into how the asset might trade amid the current investor interest. According to the AI tool, the impact of whale accumulation would likely take effect within a week and could be influenced by external factors such as overall market sentiment. Over the next 24 to 48 hours, the whale transactions and increased buying pressure may push the price to $2.30 to $2.40. The platform further noted that sustained buying momentum within three to five days could drive XRP to trade between $2.50 and $2.60, with potential consolidation at those levels. If bullish sentiment continues, XRP may challenge the $2.75 and $3 resistance zones within a week, provided no adverse market events occur. Conversely, in a bearish scenario, the price could retrace and stabilize around $2.15 to $2.20. XRP price prediction. Source: ChatGPT/Finbold Away from whale activity, XRP remains susceptible to market trends, with elements such as the Ripple and Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) case being a key influence. Notably, part of XRP‚Äôs recent breakout from prolonged consolidation below $1 was driven by the news of Gary Gensler‚Äôs exit from the SEC. What next for XRP As things stand, XRP investors hope for further upward movement if the asset maintains its valuation above the $2 support level. The token recently saw significant capital outflows that pushed it below this critical mark. XRP could rally further, as it is trading above its 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) of $1.61 and the 200-day SMA of $0.81, pointing to possible bullish sentiment in the short and long term. Elsewhere, the 14-day Relative Strength Index ( RSI ), currently at 55.19, lies in the neutral zone but leans slightly bullish, suggesting that XRP is neither overbought nor oversold. This leaves room for further price movement depending on shifts in market sentiment.

38053926,https://invezz.com/?p=2403330,1735047583,Can ZEN hit $40 after Grayscale Horizen Trust filing? This coin could be next,"Grayscale has filed its 8-K form for a Horizen Trust with the SEC, creating significant buzz around Horizen (HEZ). Notably, Grayscale‚Äôs move, coupled with the release of over 3.5 million shares and a steady accumulation of ZEN tokens, has sparked a rally in the price of Horizen (ZEN). With ZEN surging by over 27% in a single day, there is speculation that the token could be set to reach new heights, potentially hitting $40. At the same time, iDEGEN , a new AI-powered meme coin, is gaining attention with its innovative presale mechanism, positioning itself as the next big opportunity for investors besides ZEN. Horizen (ZEN) price surge after Grayscale Horizen Trust filing Grayscale‚Äôs Grayscale Horizen Trust 8-K form filing has had a clear impact on the price of ZEN, the native token of the Horizen blockchain. The Trust‚Äôs issuance of 3,565,200 shares, equating to 304,034 ZEN tokens worth $4.7 million, provides significant backing to the cryptocurrency. The trust filing is a crucial step for Grayscale as it expands its portfolio, further legitimizing Horizen as an investment vehicle for accredited investors. It adds to Grayscale‚Äôs growing suite of regulated crypto investment products, including its Bitcoin and Ethereum trusts, bringing a renewed sense of legitimacy to ZEN. Since the filing, ZEN has surged from the $29 level to $37.78, representing a remarkable 27.3% increase in a short period. This surge can be attributed to several factors, including the growing market confidence in the Horizen Trust and the influx of investors looking to capitalize on the regulated investment vehicle. Additionally, the ZEN‚Äôs breakout from a prolonged 539-day accumulation phase has led to a significant rally, with analysts such as CryptoBullet predicting that ZEN could now target the $50 mark after crossing his earlier target of $32. CryptoBullet @CryptoBullet1 ¬∑ Follow Replying to @CryptoBullet1 $ZEN update It took longer than expected but the result is the same ‚Äì #ZEN broke out of the Accumulation range to the upside and reached my Target 1 ‚úÖ +140% profit on spot so far 5:09 PM ¬∑ Dec 22, 2024 154 Reply Copy link Read 14 replies The rally that began after the breakout from the accumulation phase was long awaited. ZEN had spent over 77 weeks in a tight trading range, and once it broke above the $20 resistance level, it signalled the start of a new upward trend. The price movement is not just a technical breakout; it represents a shift in market sentiment towards Horizen as a promising investment in the broader crypto landscape. Furthermore, the announcement of the Grayscale Horizen Trust has led to increased investor interest, with ZEN‚Äôs trading volume climbing. This uptick in demand has prompted analysts to believe that the cryptocurrency could continue its rise, potentially reaching $40 in the coming weeks. As the market absorbs more ZEN, the price could climb further, supported by both the ongoing accumulation and the newly introduced institutional investors via Grayscale‚Äôs Trust. Is iDEGEN the next coin to rise? While ZEN is experiencing a surge, another cryptocurrency worth watching is iDEGEN. This AI-powered meme coin has generated considerable excitement since its launch in November 2024, raising over $8.7 million in its ongoing presale . What is attracting investors to iDEGEN is its unique dynamic pricing model that sets it apart from traditional token launches. The price of iDEGEN adjusts every five minutes based on market activity, with the price rising by 5% for consecutive purchases and falling by 5% during periods of inactivity. iDEGEN‚Äôs use of artificial intelligence (AI) further adds to its appeal. The token leverages community feedback on X (formerly Twitter) , helping to refine its development. This AI integration enhances its utility and appeal, signalling that it may not just be another meme coin but a project with the potential for long-term growth. With the presale set to conclude on January 1, 2025, and an expected listing price 10% higher than the final presale price, iDEGEN has the potential for significant returns and now could be the best time for those who are interested in jumping in. Given the success of its presale and the ongoing momentum, there‚Äôs a strong possibility that iDEGEN could be the next coin to experience explosive growth like ZEN. The innovative approach and adaptability of iDEGEN make it a compelling option for investors looking for high-growth opportunities, especially after the strong performance of ZEN following the Grayscale Horizen Trust filing.

One token making waves right now is Lightchain AI (LCAI), which is currently priced at just $0.003. Investors are already eyeing its Lightchain AI Presale as a chance to get in early on what some experts believe could be the next big thing. A crypto veteran has even predicted that LCAI could experience an explosive 12,500% growth by 2025. This bold prediction has drawn comparisons to past success stories like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. With its innovative combination of AI and blockchain technology, LCAI is aiming to disrupt the industry and position itself as a true game-changer. Here‚Äôs why experts are confident that LCAI has the potential to outpace tokens like PEPE and SHIB to become one of the top-performing altcoins of 2025. What Sets Lightchain AI (LCAI) Apart from PEPE and SHIB? While PEPE and SHIB have built strong communities based on meme value and speculation, LCAI is offering something entirely different real-world utility and cutting-edge technology that could make it a leader in both blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI). Here's what makes LCAI stand out. AI-Powered Blockchain Technology Lightchain AI (LCAI) isn't just a memecoin‚Äîit combines the power of AI with blockchain technology. This unique approach allows LCAI to offer solutions to real-world problems such as predictive analytics, supply chain optimization, and healthcare diagnostics. By leveraging AI, LCAI provides value beyond speculation, positioning it to disrupt industries and gain widespread adoption. Proof of Intelligence (PoI) While PEPE and SHIB rely on traditional consensus mechanisms or speculative value, LCAI introduces a Proof of Intelligence (PoI) mechanism. This rewards nodes for performing valuable AI computations, such as training machine learning models and processing data. This efficient and scalable approach is far more sustainable compared to traditional mechanisms like Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS). Deflationary Tokenomics LCAI uses a deflationary model where a portion of transaction fees is burned, effectively reducing the token's supply over time. This scarcity mechanism could drive up the value of LCAI as demand increases, positioning it for significant price appreciation as its adoption grows. Why Experts Are Predicting 12,500% Growth for LCAI The exciting prediction of 12,500% growth for LCAI stems from its unique position in the market. While PEPE and SHIB may be driven by hype, LCAI stands out due to its innovative technology and its ability to address real-world issues. Here's why experts believe LCAI will experience massive growth. The Perfect Time to Buy With the crypto market constantly changing, staying ahead of emerging opportunities is crucial. Experts believe now is the best time to buy LCAI before prices rise, securing a low entry point and maximizing potential returns. Anticipated Surge with Winter Crypto Rally As the winter crypto surge approaches, more investors are shifting focus to altcoins like LCAI. The expected increase in interest could drive prices up significantly, creating an optimal time to invest in LCAI for maximum potential gains. LCAI's Strong Market Position Experts are predicting massive growth for LCAI due to its unique AI-powered blockchain technology, deflationary tokenomics, and strategic roadmap. With real-world applications in key industries, LCAI is set to become a major player in the crypto space, with growth projections as high as 12,500%. Join the Revolution Today Don‚Äôt miss the opportunity to get in on the ground floor. Invest in Lightchain AI today and be part of the revolution in decentralized, AI-powered solutions. With its strong potential for growth, LCAI could deliver life-changing returns for early investors. Will LCAI Overtake PEPE and SHIB? While PEPE and SHIB have gained significant attention in the crypto world, Lightchain AI (LCAI) has the potential to outpace them due to its solid foundation and innovative technology. Unlike PEPE and SHIB, which have largely relied on hype and speculative trading, LCAI aims to solve real-world problems by integrating artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, positioning itself for long-term growth. LCAI‚Äôs decentralized governance model and high-performance blockchain infrastructure provide a significant advantage over older consensus mechanisms. These features allow LCAI to handle more transactions and complex computations, making it scalable for large-scale applications and opening doors for widespread use in various industries. LCAI is building a strong community of investors who value the platform's real-world utility and technological innovation. In contrast to the speculative nature of PEPE and SHIB, LCAI is attracting serious backers, which positions it for long-term success. With its unique features and a growing network of partnerships, LCAI could become a major player in the crypto space, potentially overtaking established tokens like PEPE and SHIB. Future of Memecoins and AI Blockchain Integration While PEPE and SHIB have captured the attention of the crypto community with their massive gains, LCAI offers a real-world solution that could make it the next big thing in the crypto market. With its innovative technology, AI-powered blockchain, and deflationary tokenomics, LCAI presents a unique opportunity for long-term growth. If you're looking to get in early on a crypto asset with massive potential, LCAI is the token to watch. Its projected 12,500% growth and its real-world applications make it a smart investment for those seeking substantial returns in the coming years.

The sudden rally positions Hedera as a key player in the altcoin market during this bull run. ‚ÄúHBAR has been flying this bull run and is a clear leader in the altcoin market. Not only is the technology progressing and achieving its developmental milestones, including introducing quantum resistance, but Hedera has also released key partnerships lately with NVIDIA, Intel, and SpaceX,‚Äù said Mati Greenspan, founder of Quantum Economics, in an interview with CryptoNews. What Is Hedera? Hedera (HBAR) is an American-led project that is governed by a council of global companies, many of which are based in the United States, including Google and IBM. Hedera is a public distributed ledger technology (DLT) platform that uses a consensus mechanism called Hashgraph, designed for high speed, low costs, and scalability. The Hedera network is known for its efficiency and low environmental impact, making it an attractive choice for institutions looking for sustainable blockchain solutions. During the Covid-19 pandemic, UK hospitals used the platform to help maintain the temperature of vaccines. HBAR Overtakes XLM and DOT HBAR‚Äôs recent surge has propelled it past both Stellar (XLM) and Polkadot (DOT) in market capitalization, solidifying its position as a top-performing altcoin. Hedera has a market capitalization of ¬£11.7 billion and ranks number 16 on CoinMarketCap overtaking Stellar and Polkadot. Stellar, known for its focus on cross-border payments, and Polkadot, a leader in blockchain interoperability, have long been considered major players in the crypto space. This milestone highlights Hedera‚Äôs increasing dominance in the crypto market, as it continues to attract investor confidence and solidify its standing among top-tier blockchain networks.

38050900,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=632750,1735047345,How MicroStrategy hype exposes overlooked flaws in US ETFs,"The craze around MicroStrategy (a company that practically turned itself into a Bitcoin holding machine) has thrown a spotlight on weaknesses in the $15 trillion exchange-traded fund (ETF) market. The ETF sector has hit a snag with two leveraged funds tied to MicroStrategy‚Äôs volatile stock. These funds, built to deliver double the daily returns of MicroStrategy shares, are instead giving investors unexpected results. The T-Rex 2x Long MSTR Daily Target ETF (MSTU) and Defiance‚Äôs Daily Target 2x Long MSTR ETF (MSTX) have seen their performances deviate wildly from expectations in recent weeks. On November 21, MSTU dropped 25.3%, according to FactSet data . That‚Äôs bad, but it should have been worse‚ÄîMicroStrategy‚Äôs stock fell 16%, meaning the fund should have dropped by 32%. A rare win for investors. But four days later, the tables turned. MSTU lost 11.3%, while MicroStrategy shares dipped just 4.4%. That‚Äôs nearly three percentage points worse than the fund‚Äôs promised performance. MSTX didn‚Äôt fare any better, losing 13.4% that same day‚Äîfar off target. The problem with size and swaps Before November, these ETFs were doing exactly what they were designed to do. But by mid-November, cracks started to appear. The funds have become too big, plain and simple. Enthusiasm for MicroStrategy‚Äîand by extension, Bitcoin‚Äîskyrocketed after Trump‚Äôs presidential victory, turning these ETFs into massive players almost overnight. Both funds are supposed to track MicroStrategy‚Äôs stock performance using tools like swaps. Swaps are straightforward. A broker pays the daily return of an asset to the fund, minus a fee, ensuring precision. But here‚Äôs the catch: MSTU is managing $2-$3 billion in daily assets, and MSTX isn‚Äôt far behind. Prime brokers can‚Äôt keep up, and the supply of swaps is drying up. With swaps maxed out, the funds turned to call options. Call options give the right to buy an asset at a specific price within a certain time. They‚Äôre a decent backup, but they don‚Äôt deliver the same accuracy as swaps. Defiance ETFs CEO Sylvia Jablonski defended the move to options, calling it efficient for achieving leverage. But critics like Dave Mazza of Roundhill Investments, argue otherwise. Options are unpredictable, especially for a stock as volatile as MicroStrategy. Mazza pointed out that these ETFs now hold exposure worth over 10% of MicroStrategy‚Äôs market cap. That‚Äôs unheard of in the ETF world. ‚ÄúMicroStrategy is too small to handle this level of trading volume and assets under management,‚Äù he said. Leveraged chaos meets Bitcoin hype MicroStrategy has gone from a software company to a full-blown Bitcoin proxy. The company holds $43 billion worth of Bitcoin, bought with mountains of debt. This year alone, its stock has surged 430%. Investors looking to amplify their exposure to Bitcoin have swarmed MSTU and MSTX, pushing these funds to their limits. When these ETFs grew too big, they hit a wall. The supply of swaps dried up, and fund managers had no choice but to rely on options. This kept the funds alive, but it introduced massive tracking errors. Kenneth Lamont of Morningstar compared the situation to past ETF disasters, like the 3x Tesla ETP by Leverage Shares. That fund couldn‚Äôt borrow enough shares to meet demand, leading to performance issues. Similarly, BlackRock had to overhaul its iShares Global Clean Energy ETF in 2020 after a surge in assets forced a complete portfolio redesign. Lamont called the MicroStrategy ETF situation ‚Äúa stuttering engine.‚Äù Rapid growth, he said, often reveals hidden flaws. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) discourages ETFs from closing to new investors, even when they run out of swaps. But Kashner suggested that stopping new unit creations could solve the problem. This would effectively turn the ETFs into closed-end funds, where prices and net asset values don‚Äôt always align. ‚ÄúFund companies must choose between growth and accuracy, and they‚Äôve clearly prioritized growth,‚Äù she said.

Initially, NEIRO will have official cross-chain versions on Ethereum and Base. Neiro on Ethereum (NEIRO), one of the more widely distributed meme tokens, will partner with ChainLink ( LINK ) for its multi-chain presence. ChainLink‚Äôs Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) replaces bridges, which are one of the riskier smart contracts. Neiro on Ethereum follows the example of Ronin, which will also replace its main bridge with CCIP. Neiro has now upgraded to the @chainlink standard for cross-chain interoperability across @base and @ethereum ! By upgrading NEIRO to the Cross-Chain Token (CCT) standard via Chainlink CCIP, we can expand our reach across the multi-chain ecosystem. https://t.co/EJGnh50O86 pic.twitter.com/0LG7Or898N ‚Äî Neiro On Ethereum (@NeiroOnEthereum) December 23, 2024 ChainLink will offer reliable oracle information for NEIRO trading on-chain. The asset will now build a presence on both Ethereum and Base, reaching a wider user base. With this move, NEIRO will compete with its other versions, such as the community-owned NEIRO. For CCIP, the tokenless Base blockchain is the main source of fees. CCIP also connects the main L2 on Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Optimism, as well as other L1 protocols, BSC and Avalanche. CCIP is making one of its first forays into meme tokens, which are usually merely recreated on the new chain, or bridged through existing smart contracts. NEIRO on Ethereum, however, will have to compete with a total of seven existing Base tokens with a similar ticker. The token has a setup that may allow it to stage a breakout, but it may face headwinds in the meme space. NEIRO on Ethereum may have to rebuild its appeal, as some of the big whales divested fully in November. NEIRO still traded on DEXs, dependent on oracle data This version of Neiro on Ethereum is in need of oracle price information, as most of its trades go through Uniswap and other DEXs. NEIRO on Ethereum lacks a Binance spot pair, though it has a derivative perpetual futures market. The token retains its usual range of owners, spreading across 21,352 wallets. With that number, NEIRO lags behind other hyped-up memes, which accrued larger user bases much faster. However, NEIRO had more time to establish its brand and liquidity, sparking hopes of becoming a long-lasting meme. The competing token, NEIRO, still has above 21K holders, plus a spot pair on Binance. This asset is strictly running on Ethereum, though it now relies on Binance for more than 30% of its trading activity. NEIRO on Ethereum is still lagging, with a total $43M market capitalization, about 10% of the community version, due to low supply. The ChainLink partnership may boost FOMO for this asset while raising it to the ranks of top tokens. The current competitive game among memes is for those that easily achieved $500M in notional value, with a bid to rise to $1B. At this stage, NEIRO‚Äôs partnerships may be an effort to regain visibility and appeal. Whale wallets still control NEIRO NEIRO started out with the reputation of a cabal coin. Even after months of trading, the Wintermute market maker controls 12.06% of the total supply, becoming the third-biggest wallet. NEIRO is held in connected wallets, with a significant share accumulated by Wintermute. | Source: Bubblemaps In addition to Wintermute, the supply of NEIRO is held in connected wallets, which may trade as hidden whales. Wintermute has been accumulating the token for months, doubling its holdings since September. The token now awaits more listings and representation, as the Wintermute wallets remain inactive for now in preparation for potential high-velocity trading. The shift of NEIRO to Base will appeal to another class of users, as the chain was marketed for its fun aspect with low fees. The NEIRO on Ethereum version competes with multiple other similar copies of the meme, which have achieved greater organic growth. For now, NEIRO has gone down a more curated path, though still requiring long-term holding from its community. A NEIRO breakout is made more difficult due to the confusion and lack of recognition of this specific token. The NEIRO on Ethereum community also weighed the coin down, as they were losing patience in absorbing losses while watching other meme tokens. NEIRO on Ethereum is not yet a cult, though it has focused on long-term holding.

Subsequently, nearly all other cryptocurrencies followed Bitcoin's crash. Recently, a Dogecoin bull who capitalized on the 2018 market meltdown and held through the ups and downs exposed their astounding benefit of 18,968%. Currently focussing on the next high-ROI coin under $1: Rexas Finance (RXS), this same investor has also. The 2018 Market Crash and Dogecoin‚Äôs Revival Driven by speculative interest and the growing popularity of cryptocurrency assets, DOGE peaked at $0.018. However, the market's fall, which saw DOGE drop to $0.002, shook the crypto scene. A few investors saw the slump as a chance to build assets at rock-bottom pricing, while many others panicked and liquidated their interests. Among these contrarian investors was a Dogecoin bull who bought significant DOGE throughout the crisis. As the market gradually rebuilt, this investor kept onto the tokens. In a burst of retail enthusiasm inspired by the tweets from Elon Musk, Dogecoin peaked at $0.74 in May 2021. During that crisis, foresight retranslated these investors' assets into an entire fortune at an outstanding profit margin of 18,968%. Rexas Finance (RXS): The Next High-ROI Coin Under $1 After their Dogecoin triumph, this DOGE bull found a fresh market opportunity: Rexas Finance (RXS). Unlike DOGE, which began as a meme coin, Rexas Finance is a utility-driven platform with real-world applications. The bull increasingly seeks projects with strong foundations and unambiguous use cases as the cryptocurrency market ages. Perfect for this profile, RXS provides a platform meant to streamline the generation and administration of digital tokens reflecting actual assets. Rexas Finance is unique in its capacity to enable people to tokenize and exchange intellectual property, commodities, and real estate, among other assets. Many analysts think this invention will propel the next wave of crypto acceptance since it puts the token front first in the Real-World Asset (RWA) industry. From its presale, Rexas Finance has already shown an amazing increase. Beginning at $0.03, the token has increased 400% to its present stage 10 price of $0.15. This stratospheric climb has drawn much attention, with the presale raising over $30.39 million so far. Giving public presale top priority over venture capital investment highlights the project's dedication to decentralization and inclusion, enabling retail investors to take part in early success. Its recent placement on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, which has raised even more awareness, adds to its legitimacy. The initiative has also completed a thorough Certik audit, a gold standard in the cryptocurrency sector, building investor and user confidence. The Dogecoin Bull‚Äôs Endorsement of Rexas Finance (RXS) Given their record of spotting high-ROI prospects, the Dogecoin bull's support of Rexas Finance is notable. Thanks to its creative approach to tokenization and solid market positioning, the investor claims RXS has the potential to provide huge returns. Rexas Finance is well on its way to being generally adopted since it plans to list on three of the top ten tier-1 exchanges. The project's unique benefit is its capacity to tokenize assets from anywhere globally, democratizing access to investment prospects. With only a few clicks, RXS enables anyone to engage in the expanding RWA market regardless of full ownership or fractional shares. The path the Dogecoin bull has taken since the 2018 crisis to an 18,968% profit is evidence of the transforming potential of cryptocurrencies. Their success story emphasizes the need to spot underpriced assets with great development capacity. The DOGE bull is betting on Rexas Finance today as the next major under-$1 token. Rexas Finance presents a unique opportunity for investors trying to replicate the success of the Dogecoin bull to join a high-growth market early on. With its creative platform, significant presale momentum, and increasing community support, RXS is positioned to provide life-changing rewards. üî• $RXS Presale Stage 10 Sold Out üî•We‚Äôre excited to announce that Rexas Finance Presale Stage 10 has been sold out! ‚úÖPresale Stage 11 is now live, with the price per token increasing to $0.175 üöÄDon‚Äôt miss your chance to get in early! ‚≠êÔ∏èBuy Now: https://t.co/tNJAsvBiYe ‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/6lg1WFwnkH ‚Äî Rexas Finance (@rexasfinance) December 23, 2024 Conclusion The amazing 18,968% profit of the Dogecoin bull reminds us of the riches cryptocurrencies can create.

Now, they have set their sights on Rexas Finance as the next high-ROI coin under $1.

The announcement was accompanied by statements that dropped a shadow on the strategic Bitcoin reserve plans. https://twitter.com/BTCTN/status/1870129497678221345 December 18, 2024, will be remembered as the day when the U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell set the crypto market on fire with a couple of phrases. The Fed, to the surprise of many, proposed a reduction of the rate cuts for 2025: there will be two interest rate cuts the next year instead of four, as was expected before. The lower interest rates are usually fueling the crypto market. Therefore, the rate cut reduction is a bearish signal. On top of that, Powell said the central bank is not allowed and is not even interested in holding any Bitcoin ( BTC ). Read more: Powell: Fed not allowed to own Bitcoin Several experts call the federal funds rates cutting by 25 basis points ‚Äúhawkish‚Äù or even ‚Äúaggressive.‚Äù The move caused a panic sale on the crypto market. Bitcoin dropped by 13% within 48 hours. Many altcoins saw even a harsher price drop: Dogecoin lost 26%, Ether declined by 16%, while XRP was down by 18%. The CoinGlass data indicates that over 1.4 billion dollars in leveraged long positions have been liquidated within a single day. Stock markets saw a substantial drop, too. Was a one-billion-dollar BlackRock investment in Bitcoin a fatal mistake? One may think that buying $1 billion worth of BTC one day before the dip would have been a catastrophe. However, we can take the example of BlackRock and see how such unfortunate timing for a massive buy-in may not be deadly in the long term. According to Arkham, BlackRock spent $1.5 billion on bitcoins within the week. A $1 billion investment in Bitcoin was made just before the dip at the price between $103k and $107k, meaning that the company purchased nearly 10,000 BTC. As of December 20, BlackRock owns over 553,000 BTC, which is around 2.6% of the total supply of Bitcoin. This investment was a 1.8% increase in the total IBIT (BlackRock‚Äôs iShares Bitcoin Trust) BTC holdings. According to the latest data from Fintel , the total holdings of BlackRock are valued at $4.7 trillion. However, other sources estimate the BlackRock holdings at over $11 trillion. The Bitcoin share of these holdings is pretty tiny, which is in line with the recent BlackRock recommendation to allocate up to 2% of Bitcoin in a multi-asset portfolio to hedge against market turbulence. It is clear that missing a better buying opportunity that occurred the day after, when the BTC price slipped under $93,000, was unfortunate. However, the value of the overall BlackRock portfolio is high enough to absorb this drop in value without much drama. Considering how many times Bitcoin was ‚Äúcrashing‚Äù only to recover at a higher value, this price downfall is negligible. What matters more is the fact of acquiring more bitcoins, which continue to grow in value and get scarcer with time. BlackRock and the Bitcoin scarcity discussion It seems that BlackRock is the prime beneficiary of Bitcoin‚Äôs scarcity. Interestingly enough, it was BlackRock who sparked the online debate about the immutability of the famous Bitcoin‚Äôs 21 million hard caps. JUST IN: BlackRock releases 3 minute educational video explaining what #Bitcoin is. pic.twitter.com/EjqBbV0GRn ‚Äî Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) December 17, 2024 On December 18, BlackRock released a 3-minute-long educational video explaining the basics of Bitcoin. At some point in the video, we can see the subtitle that reads, ‚ÄúThere is no guarantee that Bitcoin‚Äôs 21 million supply cap will not be changed.‚Äù This little remark did not go unnoticed by the crypto enthusiasts and professionals. The Bitcoin historian and the Gorilla Pool founder Kurt Wuckert Jr. took to X to raise the question about possible reasons that made BlackRock ‚Äúlube up the idea of adding inflation.‚Äù The removal of the 21 million supply cap is not impossible. The Bitcoin community can do it through a hard fork. However, the implications of such a move can shake the future sustainability of the first cryptocurrency. At large, Bitcoin security owes to the incentivization of the miners. However, if Bitcoin scarcity is not a thing anymore, the reward value may drop, making the network less protected and more vulnerable. Several users replied to Wuckert that they see the mention of the potential removal of the hard cap as a formal disclaimer made to avoid lawsuits in the event Bitcoin becomes inflationary. Others voiced the opinion that the forked Bitcoin that won‚Äôt have a 21 million limit will rather be something else and not a Bitcoin, while the hardcore community will stick with the original version. Conclusion BlackRock is willing to experiment with the relatively new asset. No matter how much of the entire BTC supply is already owned by this company, it won‚Äôt risk investing in it more than it can afford to lose, and the recent buy-in is just another purchase made by a corporation that definitely sees the value in Bitcoin itself. After all, 1 bitcoin is worth 1 bitcoin.

38050259,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/experts-call-meme-index-memex-the-next-10x-crypto-presale-heres-why,1735046467,"Experts Call Meme Index (MEMEX) The Next 10x Crypto Presale, Here‚Äôs Why","The next 10x crypto may have just started its initial coin offering (ICO). Meme Index (MEMEX) , the first-ever decentralized meme coin index, has raised over $280k in its early token presale rounds. As the name suggests, the new project allows investors to benefit from meme coin baskets, created by community votes, rather than individual tokens. Meme Index - Invest In Decentralized Meme Coin Indexes Its whitepaper describes itself as ‚Äúa huge step in the meme coin ecosystem‚Äù, not without any merits. This is the first time investors will be able to benefit from meme coin indexes, created by the MEMEX community. In fact, they will have their pick, considering Meme Index is launching four meme coin baskets, each with a different risk-reward potential. The Meme Titan Index is designed for safe players. The basket will comprise the large caps and the blue chips, with each token likely having a valuation of over $1 billion. However, even the safest meme coins offer outsized returns. With Dogecoin and Pepe likely in this basket, investors choosing it could still earn outsized returns. Next up is the Meme Moonshot Index, featuring the challengers. The basket will include tokens that are likely next to hit the billion-dollar market cap. Considering the upcoming meme coin supercycle, this index could potentially earn significant profits. The Meme Midcap Index is next, including tokens with $50 million to $250 million valuations. Some experts solely invest in such tokens, considering they already have considerable community backing but also have significant potential for upside growth. Binance - and lately Coinbase - have been prioritizing listing meme coins from this bracket. Finally, the Meme Frenzy Index is designed for the degens, those with high-risk appetites and who eye the maximum bounty. The basket will solely include low-cap tokens. Crucially, however, the tokens included will be voted in by the MEMEX community and, therefore, are unlikely to be outright scams. In fact, this index could potentially be one of the safer ways to invest in high-risk high-reward tokens, particularly for retail investors who are always late to the party. These small-scale traders may benefit from projects they never have even heard of, thanks to the power of the community. With market-wide exposure, a plethora of tokens and decentralized governance, it is no surprise why Meme Index has created such a buzz even before its launch. However, only MEMEX holders will be able to vote and access the indexes, hence the high demand for the token. Is MEMEX The Next 10x Crypto Presale? The current market uncertainty hasn‚Äôt shaken the conviction of the bulls - a meme coin supercycle is on the horizon. In such extreme market euphoria, tokens with much less value than Meme Index end up offering over 1000x returns. It is, therefore, no surprise that smart money investors have already started calling MEMEX the next 10x crypto. Others are eyeing much higher returns, owing to the project‚Äôs native staking pool which is currently offering a yield percentage of over 5000%. Besides the meme coin indexes, MEMEX is a token with strong fundamentals. For instance, it has adopted community-centric tokenomics, with no token supply allocation for the developer team or any private sale. A significant 20% of the token supply has been set aside for community rewards, in addition to the 25% supply for staking rewards. However, the attractive perks don‚Äôt mean that Meme Index has compromised with safety and transparency. For starters, the MEMEX smart contract has been audited by Coinsult and Solid Proof , with the audit reports available on the presale website. Interested buyers can purchase MEMEX with just a few clicks, using the over-the-counter widget on the Meme Index presale website. They are also advised to follow the project‚Äôs X and Telegram accounts to keep up with the latest updates.

By mid-2025, RXS has the potential to transform your financial landscape and transform the way you manage your money. Just a $600 investment in RXS as well as two other promising tokens may be enough to get rid of a 9 to 5 job and start a new life of financial freedom. RXS Set to Soar: Analysts Predict a Staggering 253,000% Growth‚ÄîEarly Investors Already Reaping 500% Gains! Investors are captivated by the platform of Rexas Finance , which has the ambition to tokenize real-world assets. RXS is currently in presale, priced at $0.150, and will increase to $0.175 in the next stage. High investor interest and confidence in the project can be seen in that the presale has so far raised more than $29 million. The overall supply is 1 billion tokens and at the moment only 354 million tokens have been sold in the current presale stage, underscoring demand for this particular asset. üî• $RXS Presale Stage 10 Sold Out üî•We‚Äôre excited to announce that Rexas Finance Presale Stage 10 has been sold out! ‚úÖPresale Stage 11 is now live, with the price per token increasing to $0.175 üöÄDon‚Äôt miss your chance to get in early! ‚≠êÔ∏èBuy Now: https://t.co/tNJAsvBiYe ‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/6lg1WFwnkH ‚Äî Rexas Finance (@rexasfinance) December 23, 2024 Analysts are confident in the RXS's future performance at some stage predicting these guys to increase by an astounding 253,000% from the current position. These projections are not based on wild speculations but are rooted firmly in Rexas Finance's unique approach to asset management and tokenization. Already, the early investors have already given significant profits while some even saw the gains as high as 500% within a few weeks of the presale launch. With this rapid appreciation, RXS is a cornerstone asset to add to anyone's forward-looking portfolio. Turn $300 into $1.2M: How RXS's Explosive Growth Could Redefine Your Financial Future by 2025! Imagine you put $300 into RXS now. This investment has the potential to explode to over $1.2m by mid-2025, with this projected growth rate.

Ethereum (ETH): A Resilient Giant Poised to Hit $20K‚ÄîWhy It‚Äôs a Must-Have for Every Investor! Ethereum (ETH) is still one of the big ones next to RXS. Ethereum caught a bullish bid at $4,014.81 and has proven to be extremely resilient and has decent growth potential. Because ETH is expected to hit $20,000 in a few years, it‚Äôs an absolute must-have in any cryptocurrency portfolio. Yet, Ethereum is still a solid choice due to its solid smart contract abilities, as well as acceptance, and above all, adoption from the developer and investor communities. $ETH is so bullish.

Another token to look at is XRP, currently trading at $2.40. Analysts have compared XRP's recent performance with the historical patterns seen in March 2017 as the coin has gained attention lately. Predictions indicate that XRP will hit new all-time highs before January 2025 with some forecasts even putting the price up to $10 in that timeframe. Investing in XRP is a very good idea, as the currency is the bridge currency of choice for cross-border transactions. The explosive growth potential works perfectly for their portfolios built around RXS and ETH. If you allocate another 25% of your investment to XRP, it will diversify your holdings and offer you an opportunity for greater returns. Building Your Path to Freedom By investing in RXS, ETH, and XRP, you‚Äôre creating a balanced portfolio that includes cutting-edge technology as well as the most established cryptocurrencies. By going all in on asset tokenization through RXS, stability and growth potential via Ethereum, and the speculation of XRP, you have a complete strategy that could lead you to financial independence. From a traditional 9 to 5 job to financial freedom is no easy task, it takes planning and investments. Looking at these three tokens ‚Äî RXS as an innovative solution to real-world assets, Ethereum for the tried and true powerhouse, and XRP for the emerging player ‚Äî you can build a path to leaving your job by mid-2025.

38049897,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=632725,1735045777,Forbes releases 7 major predictions for crypto in 2025,"The year 2024 has set up the crypto industry to become a serious topic in the international landscape. With the industry inching closer to 2025, Forbes outlined seven key predictions for significant events anticipated in the coming year. According to Forbes , the crypto industry is entering a new era of maturity and development as the calendar turns to 2025. The infrastructure is being established for widespread adoption and mainstream attention as Bitcoin solidifies its role as a global reserve asset. Also, ETFs continue to grow exponentially just as stablecoins and DeFi applications continue to expand. In addition, The crypto ecosystem is poised to redefine the future of global finance by leveraging innovative technologies and more transparent regulations. Still, the crypto industry owes 2024 a lot of appreciation. The year has been a turning point for the broader crypto ecosystem. It witnessed the introduction of the first Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, which were the first indications of genuine institutional adoption. Also, stablecoins further solidified the global dominance of the US dollar, while Bitcoin broke the $100,000 milestone for the first time. BRICS eye Bitcoin SBRs and the US wants to be a crypto powerhouse BRICS nations have been plotting to dethrone the US dollar. The crypto industry‚Äôs independent nature gives it the greatest chance to achieve its agenda. Bitcoin is the sector‚Äôs giant, and it has recently gained significant support from big companies and nations like El Salvador and its president, Nayib Bukele. The race is now on to be the first major country to incorporate Bitcoin into its reserve strategy. This would be diversifying assets alongside traditional holdings such as gold, foreign currencies, and sovereign bonds. This action would further solidify Bitcoin‚Äôs status as a global reserve asset. It would also alter the dynamics of international finance, with far-reaching implications for economic and geopolitical power structures. The initiation of a new era in sovereign wealth management could be signaled by the establishment of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve by a prominent economy. That race is now between the US, El Salvador, and BRICS nations. BRICS nations have this consideration the most. In addition, the Trump administration plans to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) for the United States. However, there would have to be a lot of political willpower and congressional approval before Bitcoin is added to the US Treasury‚Äôs balance sheet. By indicating that an SBR is possible, the US has caused other big countries to consider doing the same. Based on game theory, these countries may feel compelled to move ahead of time, beating the US to gain a strategic advantage in diversifying their national reserves. The fact that Bitcoin is limited and is becoming more popular as a digital currency store could make it even more important for countries to move quickly. Moreover, the crypto industry in the United States is on the verge of a transformative resurgence. SEC Chairman Gary Gensler‚Äôs controversial ‚Äúregulation by enforcement‚Äù approach, which stifled innovation and drove many crypto ventures offshore, will end with his departure. He will be succeeded by Paul Atkins, who offers a drastically different viewpoint. Atkins is renowned for his pro-crypto posture, advocacy for deregulation, and leadership in initiatives such as the Token Alliance, a pro-crypto advocacy group. His method guarantees a more collaborative regulatory framework, promoting innovation rather than suppressing it. Furthermore, the United States will experience a substantial rise in token launches. This is due to renewed support for innovation and enhanced regulatory clarity. Startups will feel empowered to issue tokens as part of their fundraising and ecosystem-building endeavors. These tokens, which encompass utility tokens for decentralized applications and governance tokens for protocols, will attract both domestic and international capital, thereby promoting participation in US-based projects. Stablecoins expansion will persist, with the potential to double in value Stablecoins have become one of the most successful conventional use cases in the crypto space. They have provided a connection between the crypto ecosystem and traditional finance. In 2024, the circulating supply of stablecoins attained an all-time high of $200 billion, with market leaders Circle and Tether dominating the market. Total stablecoin market cap. Source: Forbes The development of stablecoins is expected to accelerate in 2025, with the potential to double and surpass $400 billion. This expansion is anticipated to be stimulated by the potential passage of stablecoin-specific legislation. This could offer the sector much-needed regulatory clarity and encourage innovation. US regulators are increasingly acknowledging the strategic significance of stablecoins in bolstering the US dollar‚Äôs global dominance and reaffirming its status as the world‚Äôs reserve currency. As other nations slowly expose themselves to the crypto industry, stablecoins are the first stop due to their secure nature from volatility. Tech industry embraces Bitcoin as DeFi ecosystem grows As Bitcoin transitions from its role as a store of value, layer 2 (L2) networks such as Stacks, BOB, Babylon, CoreDAO, and others are unlocking the potential for a flourishing Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem. Looking into 2025, Bitcoin DeFi is expected to increase exponentially. The total value locked on Bitcoin L2s will exceed $24 billion. Currently, it is represented by wrapped Bitcoin futures, which account for approximately 1.2% of the total Bitcoin supply. Also, Bitcoin‚Äôs market cap is nearing $2 trillion. This will stir up L2 networks, which will allow users to harness its tremendous latent value in a more secure and efficient manner. This will be possible by cementing Bitcoin‚Äôs place as a cornerstone of decentralized finance. In addition, it is highly probable that one of 7 magnificent tech titans, in addition to Tesla, will incorporate Bitcoin into its balance sheet. This is because of the improved accounting framework and the growing regulatory clarity. This is because the Magnificent Seven‚ÄîApple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Nvidia, Tesla, and Meta‚Äîcollectively possess more than $600 billion in cash reserves. This provides them with substantial flexibility to allocate a portion of their capital to Bitcoin. Bitcoin ETFs will rise and other crypto ETFs will appear The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs attracted over $108 billion in assets under management (AUM) within its first year. These ETFs demonstrated unparalleled demand from both retail and institutional investors. Comparison of BlackRock‚Äôs gold and Bitcoin AUM. Source: Forbes The success of Bitcoin ETFs became the launchpad for the debut of Ethereum ETFs. In 2025, Ethereum ETFs will introduce staking for the first time. The opportunity for investors to gain staking rewards is expected to further enhance the appeal and value of these funds. In addition, ETFs will soon be available for other prominent crypto protocols. Solana will be one of them as it has become well-known for its high-performance blockchain, vibrant DeFi ecosystem, and rapid expansion in gaming, NFTs, and memecoins. Furthermore, it is expected that weighted crypto index ETFs will be introduced in order to provide diversified exposure to the broader crypto market. A balanced portfolio that encapsulates the growth potential of a combination of top-performing assets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and others, as well as emerging protocols. These advancements will increase the accessibility, efficiency, and allure of crypto investing. It will attract a diverse array of investors, thereby directing additional capital into the sector. The total crypto market cap will surpass $8 trillion The overall market capitalization of the crypto market is projected for record-breaking levels as capital flows into the space and user bases expand. Asset prices will consequently follow suit. With this momentum, the crypto market is poised to surpass $8 trillion, indicating the industry‚Äôs ongoing growth and innovation. Looking back at 2024, the total crypto market cap surged to an all-time high of $3.8 trillion. Now, companies are already setting funds aside for crypto investments. Recently, Microstrategy has come up with the 21/21 plan. It aims to raise $21 billion through equity financing and another $21 billion through bond issuance over three years. Saylor has already clarified that these funds will be used to buy more Bitcoin to showcase the company‚Äôs commitment to Bitcoin. In addition, the influx of developer talent into the crypto ecosystem is anticipated to increase by 2025. This will result in the development of new applications that achieve product-market fit and enroll millions of additional users. This wave of innovation is expected to generate groundbreaking decentralized applications (dApps) in emerging disciplines that are still in their infancy, including artificial intelligence (AI), decentralized finance (DeFi), and decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN).

Since December 21st, the cryptocurrency has managed to consolidate above $2.20, where it‚Äôs currently trading. While many market experts are debating on whether or not the XRP bull run is over, it appears that the volatility has caused a massive uptick in trading volume, particularly on Binance. According to a CryptoQuant analyst, XRP has become the most traded altcoin and the leading exchange for December so far. Source: CryptoQuant To be more precise, XRP is the most traded altcoin on the Binance Futures platform, and not on the spot market. It has achieved a trading volume of around $116 billion, with December not yet finished. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important to track the top-traded coins on Binance, as they should be your main focus when trading altcoins. In the past two days, both Bitcoin and altcoins have experienced large declines. XRP seems to be one that could recover quickly.‚Äù On December 21st, the popular trader and market analyst Ali Martinez told his followers that the current level of $2.20 is pivotal for the future price of XRP. He maintained that if XRP can ‚Äúhold above $2.20, it might consolidate for a while before taking another shot at the $2.70 resistnace.‚Äù On the other hand, though, the trader said that if this support breaks, a ‚Äúdownswing to $1.96 becomes imminent.‚Äù Meanwhile, XRP trades at a 3% increase for the day, but remains almost 11% down during the past week with a total 24-hour trading volume of around $7 billion across all exchanges.

38049724,https://finbold.com/?p=222401,1735045553,Why MicroStrategy might collapse below $100 in 2025,"MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR) has been the great beneficiary of the other 2024 boom ‚Äì the one in the cryptocurrency market . The company‚Äôs strategic investment in Bitcoin (BTC), paired with BTC‚Äôs own stellar performance, has led to a share price skyrocketing of 384.87% in the year-to-date (YTD) chart and a press time price of $332.23. MSTR stock YTD price chart. Source: Google However, on December 24, 2024, MicroStrategy stock is facing an increasing danger of an imminent plummet, with at least one cause being by the firm‚Äôs own design. Specifically, a recent Schedule 14A document filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) revealed that Michel Saylor is hoping, with stakeholder approval, to increase the number of MSTR shares by approximately 11 billion. Could MicroStrategy‚Äôs latest BTC-buying scheme lead to MSTR stock price collapse? Thus far, MicroStrategy‚Äôs various capital-raising drives ‚Äì all done with the aim of increasing the funds available for additional Bitcoin purchases ‚Äì have been met with a positive reaction from investors. Still, the intent to increase the number of common shares by 10 billion and preferred equity by 1 billion might, if approved, prove a step too far as it would significantly dilute MSTR equity. Indeed, the plan calls for a thirtyfold increase in the number of shares. On the flip side, even if the so-called 21/21 plan ‚Äì a plan to raise $42 billion via equity and fixed-income assets to buy more Bitcoin ‚Äì sends MSTR stock flying back below $100, it would not necessarily be a detrimental development. Ultimately, the planned issuing and its consequences could be either positive or negative for the company and its stakeholders, depending on how high BTC can go and when the current bull cycle in the cryptocurrency market will end. At press time on December 24, Bitcoin is facing strong headwinds and it has, in approximately one week, retraced from its all-time highs (ATH) above $108,000 to the still-impressive $94,000.

Simultaneously, thanks to the rally in the last 12 months and the perpetual volatility of digital assets, further purchases could prove an exceptionally risky maneuver since another ‚Äòcrypto winter‚Äô could always be right around the corner. Whatever 2025 brings, by the end of 2024, it has become more evident than ever that Michael Saylor and his firm are going ‚Äòall in‚Äô on Bitcoin. In late November, MicroStrategy executed its largest-ever BTC purchase to the tune of $5.4 billion .

38051781,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=632784,1735045510,America regains momentum as the crypto capital of the world heading into 2025,"America is back at the top of the crypto food chain, reclaiming its position as the global crypto capital just in time for 2025. This comeback is fueled by a wild combination of Donald Trump‚Äôs reelection and an explosion in demand for US-based crypto products like Bitcoin ETFs and derivatives. Trump‚Äôs mere promise to turn America into the beating heart of the global crypto market has put it right on its way there. Bitcoin‚Äôs meteoric rise past $100,000 this year didn‚Äôt happen by accident. Demand in the US is driving liquidity and setting global pricing benchmarks. The Biden administration‚Äôs restrictive crypto policies pushed Asia into the spotlight for a brief moment last year, but Trump‚Äôs new pro-crypto approach has reversed that. Now, the US is once again the center of gravity in the crypto world, pulling everything back into its orbit. Bitcoin ETFs dominate with record-breaking volumes Bitcoin ETFs in the US have been a runaway success. Launched in January, these funds have pulled in over $500 billion in cumulative daily trading volume. They‚Äôve also attracted $36 billion in net inflows. BlackRock‚Äôs iShares Bitcoin Trust stands out, becoming one of the most successful ETF launches ever. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), once criticized for its slow-moving approach, finally got it right by approving these spot Bitcoin ETFs. But the party isn‚Äôt stopping there. Under Trump, the range of available ETFs is expected to grow beyond just Bitcoin and Ether. America is preparing for a full-on crypto buffet, and Wall Street is already making room for more. CME Group, based in Chicago, is another big winner in all of this. It‚Äôs now the leader in Bitcoin futures open interest, leaving offshore giants like Binance in the dust. Open interest for Bitcoin and Ether futures has smashed previous records this year, showing just how much confidence the market has in US-regulated platforms. The collapse of FTX in 2022 dealt a nasty blow to global liquidity, but Trump‚Äôs policies and the rise of these ETFs have helped the market recover. Kaiko data shows that crypto market depth‚Äîhow easily big trades can be made without wrecking prices‚Äîis back to where it was before the FTX disaster. The so-called ‚ÄúAlameda gap‚Äù? Gone. America drives trading hours and liquidity dominance It‚Äôs not just the big institutions that are benefiting. Everyday investors are also reshaping the market. The share of Bitcoin trading during US hours has jumped to 53%, up from 40% in 2021, according to data from Kaiko. That‚Äôs a massive change in trading patterns, with liquidity dominance firmly planted on American soil. CF Benchmarks Head of Product Thomas Erd√∂si calls this a sign of growing institutional involvement. Simply put, more big players are entering the game, and they‚Äôre doing it in the US With over $100 billion in assets under management across 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs, the numbers speak for themselves. Still though, not everyone is ready to dive in. A survey by Cerulli Associates found that 59% of financial advisors are still steering clear of crypto conversations with their clients. The volatility of Bitcoin, despite its incredible performance this year, is still a major concern. Prices have climbed nearly 120% year-to-date as of December 20, driven largely by Trump‚Äôs pro-crypto policies. But for cautious advisors, that volatility is still a hard pill to swallow. For those who are investing, the advice is clear: keep your allocation small and rebalance often. Portfolio strategists recommend sticking to 2% to 3% of your total investments in Bitcoin ETFs . The idea is to avoid letting these highly volatile assets overshadow the rest of your portfolio. Regular rebalancing‚Äîmonthly or at least quarterly‚Äîis very important when it comes to managing risk in such a turbulent market.

Priced at just $0.003 , this undervalued gem is garnering increasing attention from top crypto investors, including Ethereum whales, who see it as the next big thing in the altcoin space. With analysts predicting potential gains as high as 120x, LCAI could be the next breakout star in the crypto world. But what makes Lightchain AI such an attractive investment, and why are Ethereum whales so eager to pile into this low-priced token? Let‚Äôs break down what makes this token stand out. The Rise of Lightchain AI (LCAI) New Kind of Token Most altcoins are limited to niche uses or speculative trading, but LCAI is a game-changer. Lightchain AI merges blockchain technology with artificial intelligence (AI) to create a versatile platform poised to transform industries like finance, healthcare, logistics, and AI-powered governance. This isn‚Äôt just another meme coin‚ÄîLCAI is built for real-world utility and long-term value. A key feature of LCAI is its AI-Driven Blockchain Ecosystem, powered by the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM). This enables developers to create AI-powered decentralized applications (dApps), unlocking innovations like predictive finance analytics and advanced healthcare machine learning. LCAI also offers deflationary tokenomics, where a portion of transaction fees is burned, reducing supply over time and potentially increasing long-term value. With these groundbreaking features, LCAI is positioned to revolutionize industries and redefine the future of blockchain and AI. Why Ethereum Whales Are Moving Into LCAI Ethereum whales, who have seen massive gains in ETH over the years, are increasingly turning their attention to LCAI for several key reasons. Strong Growth Potential At just $0.003, LCAI is positioned for massive price appreciation. With analysts predicting a 120x return by 2025, this presents an exciting opportunity for whales who are looking to capitalize on the next big breakout in the market. AI and Blockchain Integration Lightchain AI is one of the few tokens that seamlessly combines artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, making it highly attractive to investors who see AI as the future. As AI adoption continues to soar, LCAI‚Äôs unique positioning could make it a leader in this rapidly growing sector. Utility-Driven Approach Unlike speculative tokens, LCAI is grounded in real-world applications, solving real problems in industries such as finance, supply chain, and machine learning. Investors are increasingly looking for projects with tangible use cases that offer long-term value. Institutional Attention As LCAI gains traction, it‚Äôs attracting attention from institutional investors and major crypto players who want to diversify their portfolios and gain exposure to a next-generation blockchain project that offers both innovation and scalability. What Sets LCAI Apart from Other Altcoins? While there are plenty of altcoins to choose from, LCAI stands out for its combination of innovative technology and deflationary tokenomics, which sets it apart from other projects like Dogecoin (DOGE) or Shiba Inu (SHIB). Here‚Äôs how LCAI compares to other well-known tokens. Feature Lightchain AI (LCAI) Ethereum (ETH) Solana (SOL) Technology AI-powered blockchain Smart contracts, dApps High-speed blockchain Consensus Mechanism Proof of Intelligence (PoI) Proof of Stake (PoS) Proof of History (PoH) Tokenomics Deflationary Inflationary Inflationary Primary Focus AI and blockchain integration DeFi, NFTs, dApps Speed and low cost Growth Potential High (12,000x by 2025) Moderate Moderate Road Ahead Can LCAI Reach $2 by 2025? With Lightchain AI 's innovative technology, deflationary tokenomics, and real-world applications, the question now is how high it can rise in the coming years. While precise price predictions remain uncertain, there are several factors pointing to LCAI's potential for significant growth. With the increasing demand for AI-driven solutions across industries, LCAI is well-positioned to capture a share of this rapidly growing market by enabling developers to create AI applications on the blockchain. Additionally, the rising interest in AI tokens from major investors is expected to further fuel LCAI‚Äôs growth. Lightchain AI's roadmap, which includes key milestones such as the testnet launch, strategic partnerships, and the mainnet rollout, will help strengthen investor confidence and increase the token‚Äôs value over time. Given these factors, LCAI could very well see substantial gains, possibly reaching $2 or even higher by 2025. LCAI Is the Token to Watch in 2024 and Beyond Lightchain AI (LCAI) is positioning itself for massive growth with its innovative technology, real-world applications, and deflationary tokenomics. As Ethereum whales, institutional investors, and early adopters increasingly take notice, many believe LCAI is set to outperform top altcoins like Solana and Dogecoin. With the growing demand for AI-powered blockchain solutions, LCAI stands at the forefront of this technological revolution, making it an exciting opportunity for those seeking significant returns in the next bull run. Now, with its presale priced at just $0.003, early investors have the chance to get in before the wave of growth. As Ethereum whales continue to show interest in LCAI, this token has the potential to become the next big winner in the crypto space.

The year 2024 marks a watershed moment for financial markets globally as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission greenlit the first Bitcoin ( BTC ) spot ETF, a pivotal development signalling a shift toward greater institutional acceptance of digital assets. This milestone underscores the dramatic evolution of cryptocurrencies from niche speculative assets to cornerstone investment opportunities. You might also like: The promises of Bitcoin-backed loans for institutional portfolios | Opinion Major financial entities are increasingly leveraging digital assets for robust portfolio diversification and as a strategic hedge against inflationary pressures. As regulatory frameworks mature and economic necessities press, the integration of cryptocurrencies into traditional financial systems is not just a trend‚Äîit is redefining the very mechanics of how financial markets operate, setting the stage for a new era in digital finance. From scepticism to strategy: The institutional pivot to crypto Cryptocurrencies are increasingly recognized for their unique benefits as a diversification tool, offering low correlation with traditional financial assets. The 2024 Gemini Global State of Crypto Report underscores that institutional investors are now more bullish on digital assets than ever, viewing them as essential for portfolio diversification. Concurrently, amid global inflation spikes, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are being embraced as alternative hedges. According to Ernst & Young‚Äôs 2024 report , institutional investors are gravitating towards Bitcoin for its stability as a store of value, preferring it over traditional assets like gold during inflationary periods. This sentiment is reinforced by data showing that nearly 94% of institutional investors acknowledge the long-term potential of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, with 55% planning to increase their digital asset holdings within the next two to three years. As regulatory frameworks continue to evolve, institutional confidence is strengthening. Recent developments, such as the EU‚Äôs Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation , have created a more structured and secure investment environment, reducing the operational risks previously associated with crypto assets. Additionally, the recent U.S. presidential election, which saw the reelection of Donald Trump, is poised to influence the regulatory landscape further. His administration‚Äôs historically light regulatory approach to cryptocurrencies may boost investor confidence and foster an environment more conducive to blockchain innovations. This shift could ease the integration of cryptocurrencies into traditional financial systems, marking a significant step toward broader governmental acceptance of digital assets. Moreover, the establishment of dedicated crypto custody solutions by major financial institutions like BNY Mellon and Goldman Sachs highlights the sector‚Äôs ongoing maturation, bringing it closer in line with traditional financial operations. Institutional impact: Reshaping market dynamics Institutional investments have substantially enhanced market liquidity in the cryptocurrency sector. According to a 2024 report by Cointribune, institutional inflows into cryptocurrencies reached unprecedented levels, with $14.9 billion entering the market, surpassing the prior record set in 2021. BlackRock‚Äôs launch of a blockchain-backed ETF has played a pivotal role in this surge, enhancing liquidity by providing additional entry points for institutional funds and mitigating market volatility. This move by BlackRock has facilitated greater entry points for institutional money, significantly reducing market volatility and stabilizing price fluctuations. Alongside improvements in market liquidity, the influx of institutional investments has also raised the bar for compliance and security within the cryptocurrency sector. The professionalization of the market is exemplified by major banks like JPMorgan, which has introduced a Cryptocurrency Exposure Basket. By offering these innovative products, JPMorgan and similar institutions have established robust custody and security solutions that align with the regulatory standards expected in traditional finance. This advancement is critical in enhancing the trust and safety of investing in digital assets. Moreover, the increasing demand from institutional investors has catalyzed innovation within the financial product landscape. Financial giants such as Goldman Sachs have responded to this demand by expanding their offerings to include Bitcoin futures trading. This development is significant as it represents a broader acceptance of cryptocurrencies within the fabric of traditional banking services, allowing established financial institutions to meet the evolving needs of their clients and incorporate digital assets into their broader investment strategies. Together, these developments‚Äîenhanced market liquidity, elevated compliance and security standards, and the proliferation of innovative financial products‚Äîillustrate the profound impact institutional investors have on the cryptocurrency landscape. As these trends continue to evolve, they are set to reshape the financial markets, making cryptocurrencies a permanent fixture in the investment portfolios of mainstream financial institutions. Institutional investors: Shaping the future of crypto markets While institutional capital introduces challenges like regulatory inconsistencies, cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and environmental concerns, these issues are catalysts for progress rather than obstacles. Addressing regulatory divergence is driving international efforts to create more unified frameworks, while advancements in cybersecurity are ensuring that digital assets are increasingly protected against evolving threats. Simultaneously, innovations in sustainable blockchain technologies are addressing environmental concerns, aligning crypto investments with ESG priorities and showcasing the industry‚Äôs commitment to responsible growth. These strides not only mitigate the challenges but also unlock new opportunities, such as the expansion of DeFi and asset tokenization. Institutional investors are playing a pivotal role in refining the cryptocurrency ecosystem. They are transforming digital assets into integral components of the global financial system, redefining investment paradigms, and heralding a future of greater diversification and stability in financial markets.

38049549,https://finbold.com/?p=222403,1735045273,Crypto millionaire sells more Ethereum for Bitcoin in a $70M-losing trade,"A known crypto millionaire, active investor, trader, and Ethereum ( ETH ) supporter continues to capitulate from a losing Ethereum-Bitcoin ( BTC ) trade. James Fickel is among the richest cryptocurrency investors and a recognized entrepreneur in longevity research as the Amaranth Foundation‚Äôs founder. In its most recent activity, Fickel swapped another 6,500 ETH for 235.6 wBTC in the Ethereum blockchain. This swap, currently worth around $22 million, is a partial close of the millionaire‚Äôs ETH long position against BTC. According to SpotOnChain‚Äô s post , Amaranth‚Äôs founder has already lost approximately 22,000 ETH with this trade, worth over $70 million. His wBTC activity dates back from October 2023, supposedly when Fickel started his trades against the leading cryptocurrency. Previously, Finbold reported two partial closes of the crypto millionaire‚Äôs Ether-Bitcoin trade ‚Äì one in August and the other in September . The first happened as decentralized finance (DeFi) investors considered removing wBTC from Aave ( AAVE ) following BitGo‚Äôs partnership with Justin Sun. wBTC In/Out flow of James Fickel‚Äôs Wallet 0xd85 since October 30, 2023. Source: SpotOnChain James Fickel‚Äôs ETH-wBTC position and trades on Aave Essentially, James Fickel is using a DeFi strategy to open long and short positions on spot, without using derivative contracts. Through lending platforms like Aave, investors can supply digital assets to smart contract pools. Then, use these supplied assets as collateral to borrow other cryptocurrencies from other decentralized pools. Therefore, an investor looking to long Ethereum against Bitcoin can supply ETH, use it as collateral to borrow wBTC, and use the borrowed tokens to buy more ETH in decentralized exchanges like Uniswap ( UNI ). If the ETH/BTC exchange rate increases, the trader can swap the purchased amount of ETH for wBTC, repay the debt plus the compounded interest rates, and pocket the profit in their preferred asset. In fact, the millionaire‚Äôs position currently has supplied 78,527.95 ETH, worth $317.11 million, according to Arkham Intelligence . With this collateral, Fickel holds a debt of 575.29 wBTC, worth $54.17 million, which he has been repaying. James Fickel‚Äôs Borrows & Loans.

Built on Ethereum‚Äôs robust Layer 2 blockchain, 5thScape has created an ecosystem that caters to gamers, developers, and investors, positioning itself as a leader in the rapidly expanding VR market. At its core, 5thScape delivers a decentralized virtual reality hub where users can access interactive VR games, join tournaments, and monetize their gameplay. The platform‚Äôs native token, 5SCAPE , drives this ecosystem, providing rewards, staking opportunities, and exclusive access to VIP features. This makes 5thScape more than just a gaming hub; it‚Äôs a lucrative investment opportunity with real-world applications. A key highlight of 5thScape is its capped supply of 5.21 billion tokens, ensuring scarcity and creating a sense of FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) among potential investors. The ongoing presale phase has already raised over $8.4 million , reflecting strong investor confidence. Currently priced at $0.00433 per token , early investors will yield significant gains, especially with the projected listing price of $0.01 in January 2025 . This equates to a staggering 130% profit from day one, with the potential for exponential growth post-launch. Beyond gaming, 5thScape‚Äôs forward-thinking approach includes plans to integrate AR (Augmented Reality) and IoT (Internet of Things) technologies, further expanding its use cases. The VR market is expected to exceed $80 billion by 2027, growing at an annual rate of 43.5% from 2024. With its innovative features and real-world utility, 5thScape is well-positioned to capture a significant share of this booming market. For investors looking to secure a stake in the future of digital ecosystems , 5thScape offers an exceptional opportunity. 5thScape isn‚Äôt just a token‚Äîit‚Äôs the key to a new era of immersive digital experiences. Act now to join this transformative journey before the presale ends and the window for early profits closes. 2. Pi (PI): Revolutionizing Mobile-First Cryptocurrency Adoption Pi Network redefines cryptocurrency accessibility by enabling users to mine PI tokens directly from their mobile devices without consuming excessive battery or energy. Designed to make crypto adoption seamless, Pi Network eliminates the barriers of traditional mining, opening doors for a global audience to participate in the decentralized economy. Currently operating in an enclosed mainnet phase, Pi Network is building a robust ecosystem with applications, marketplaces, and decentralized utilities to support real-world use cases for PI tokens. This strategy aims to shift the narrative from speculation to genuine utility. With over 35 million active users worldwide, Pi‚Äôs growing community underscores its potential as a transformative force in crypto. The coin‚Äôs capped supply model ensures scarcity, which could drive value appreciation over time. Pi Network has also prioritized user-centric governance, allowing its members to have a say in its evolution and ensuring transparency and inclusivity. As it approaches its open mainnet launch, speculation about Pi‚Äôs listing price continues to fuel interest. For investors, Pi represents a long-term opportunity to capitalize on an ecosystem that blends innovation, utility, and inclusivity. 3. Solana (SOL): The Blockchain for Speed and Scalability Solana is a leading blockchain for developers and enterprises seeking high-speed, cost-effective solutions. Its unique Proof of History (PoH) consensus mechanism ensures transaction speeds of over 65,000 transactions per second (TPS) while maintaining low costs. This scalability has made Solana a favorite for decentralized applications (dApps), DeFi platforms, and NFT marketplaces. SOL, Solana‚Äôs native token, plays a critical role in the ecosystem. It is used for staking, paying transaction fees, and participating in the blockchain‚Äôs governance. Solana‚Äôs robust ecosystem includes over 400 projects ranging from decentralized exchanges to gaming platforms, highlighting its versatility. Despite market fluctuations, Solana‚Äôs innovative technology and developer-friendly environment ensure its long-term viability. As the blockchain space grows, Solana‚Äôs focus on speed and efficiency positions it as a frontrunner for mainstream adoption. 4. Binance Coin (BNB): The Utility Powerhouse Binance Coin (BNB) began as a utility token for the Binance Exchange, but its functionality has expanded far beyond its original purpose. As one of the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, BNB is the backbone of the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), powering thousands of dApps and DeFi platforms. BNB holders enjoy numerous benefits, including discounted trading fees on Binance, participation in token sales on Binance Launchpad, and earning rewards through staking. The token‚Äôs capped supply of 200 million adds a scarcity factor, while Binance‚Äôs quarterly token burns further reduce circulation, supporting its price growth. Beyond trading, BNB is also used for travel bookings, payments, and charitable donations, showcasing its versatility. Binance‚Äôs commitment to innovation and compliance continues to solidify BNB‚Äôs position as a leader in the crypto space. 5. Ripple (XRP): Transforming Cross-Border Payments Ripple‚Äôs XRP token is revolutionizing the financial sector by streamlining cross-border payments. Unlike traditional systems that are slow and costly, RippleNet leverages blockchain technology to enable instant, low-cost transactions, making it a preferred choice for banks and payment providers worldwide. XRP is a bridge currency that facilitates transactions between different fiat currencies and reduces the need for pre-funded accounts. Ripple‚Äôs partnerships with over 300 financial institutions highlight its potential to disrupt the $156 trillion global cross-border payment market. The limited supply of 100 billion XRP tokens and Ripple‚Äôs ongoing efforts to enhance liquidity further bolster its value proposition. As regulatory clarity improves and adoption grows, XRP remains a strong contender for investors seeking utility-driven cryptocurrencies. By focusing on solving real-world financial inefficiencies, Ripple positions XRP as a long-term player in the evolving digital economy. Concluding Thoughts On The Best Cryptocurrency To Buy Now Regarding identifying the best cryptocurrency to buy now, 5thScape (5SCAPE) stands out as a frontrunner. Its innovative fusion of blockchain and virtual reality, capped token supply, and a clear roadmap for integrating IoT and AR make it a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. By offering immersive gaming, staking rewards, and real-world applications, 5thScape isn‚Äôt just a token; it‚Äôs a transformative digital ecosystem poised for exponential growth. Contenders like Pi, Solana, Binance Coin, and Ripple each bring unique strengths. From Pi‚Äôs mobile-first mining revolution to Solana‚Äôs unmatched scalability, Binance Coin‚Äôs versatile utility, and Ripple‚Äôs dominance in cross-border payments, these coins present excellent opportunities for diversifying their portfolios. However, the blend of scarcity, innovation, and utility places 5thScape in a league of its own. Factors to Consider While Investing in Cryptocurrency Utility and Innovation: Assess the coin‚Äôs real-world use cases and technological innovations before investing. Projects like 5thScape, with its integration of blockchain and VR, stand out because they offer tangible solutions and cater to emerging markets like gaming and AR. Tokenomics Understanding the coin‚Äôs supply and distribution is crucial. As seen with 5thScape‚Äôs 5.21 billion tokens, a capped supply can drive long-term value through scarcity . Similarly, factors like staking rewards and token burns should also be considered. Market Trends and Adoption: Examine how the cryptocurrency aligns with industry trends and its potential for mass adoption. Coins that solve existing inefficiencies, like Ripple‚Äôs cross-border payment system or Binance Coin‚Äôs diverse use cases, are worth exploring. Community and Development Team: Strong community backing and an experienced development team can make or break a project. Look for active development and regular updates, which signal a project‚Äôs commitment to growth and success. By weighing these factors carefully, you can make informed decisions and identify cryptocurrencies with the highest potential for ROI.

38049503,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=666720,1735045234,Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Fueling Potential Dip ‚Äì $90K Support Crucial Level To Hold,"Bitcoin experienced a highly volatile trading session yesterday, with prices swinging between $92,300 and $96,420 throughout the day. The cryptocurrency now hovers near the $93,000 mark, struggling to establish a clear direction in the short term. As market participants await decisive action, uncertainty looms over whether Bitcoin will sustain its bullish structure or face a deeper correction. Related Reading: If History Repeats Dogecoin Has Potential For A Parabolic Rally ‚Äì Details CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler recently shared valuable insights, highlighting a significant trend among short-term holders (STH). According to Adler, these investors continue to sell their coins at high-profit margins, capitalizing on Bitcoin‚Äôs recent upward momentum. While profit-taking is a natural part of market cycles, the lack of consistent demand to absorb this selling pressure could challenge Bitcoin‚Äôs price stability. If demand fails to match the pace of active profit-taking, a local correction could occur, potentially leading to a decline in Bitcoin‚Äôs price. This delicate balance between profit-taking and market demand makes the coming days critical for determining Bitcoin‚Äôs next move. Will buyers step in to support the price, or will selling pressure lead to a deeper retrace? Investors and analysts are watching closely as Bitcoin navigates this pivotal moment. Bitcoin Demand Levels Responding Bitcoin has faced days of intense volatility as it struggles to break above the $100,000 psychological barrier while holding firm above the $92,000 support. The market remains in a state of flux, with investors and analysts closely monitoring Bitcoin‚Äôs next move. Despite the uncertainty, Bitcoin‚Äôs resilience at these key levels highlights the ongoing tug-of-war between bullish and bearish forces. Top analyst Axel Adler recently shared an insightful analysis on X, shedding light on the behavior of short-term holders (STHs). According to Adler, STHs are actively selling their coins at high profit margins, taking advantage of the recent price surges. While profit-taking is a normal part of market cycles, a lack of consistent demand to counter this selling pressure could lead to a local correction and a potential price decline. However, in the event of a price drop, STHs are unlikely to continue selling their holdings, as selling at a loss in a bull market is often considered an unwise move. This dynamic could provide Bitcoin with the breathing room needed to stabilize at its key support levels, currently around the $90,000 mark. Related Reading: Solana Holds Weekly Support At $180 ‚Äì Analyst Expects $330 Mid-Term If Bitcoin successfully holds above $90,000, a period of consolidation around this level could create the foundation for the next rally, potentially propelling BTC to new all-time highs. The coming days will be critical in determining whether Bitcoin continues its ascent or faces a temporary setback. BTC Holding Above $90K Bitcoin is trading at $93,800 after enduring days of selling pressure and market uncertainty. Despite holding above key support at $92,000, the loss of both the 4-hour 200 moving average (MA) and exponential moving average (EMA) is a short-term bearish signal. These indicators, often viewed as gauges of market momentum, suggest that Bitcoin may need additional demand to regain upward traction. For bulls to reclaim control and ignite a fresh rally, Bitcoin must recover these critical levels. The 4-hour 200 MA at $96,500 and the 4-hour 200 EMA at $98,500 are essential hurdles. Successfully pushing above these thresholds and securing a decisive close beyond them would confirm renewed bullish momentum.

On the flip side, failing to reclaim these indicators might signal extended consolidation or a potential retest of lower support levels.

38049482,https://coinpaper.com/6704/david-schwartz-s-10x-times-tweet-ignites-xrp-community-buzz,1735045200,"David Schwartz‚Äôs ""10x Times"" Tweet Ignites XRP Community Buzz","Ripple's Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, has ignited speculation within the XRP community with a cryptic tweet referencing a ‚Äù10x increase,‚Äù coinciding with a significant price rally for the cryptocurrency. As XRP surged nearly 13% over the weekend, discussions among enthusiasts intensified, pondering the implications of Schwartz's message. Meanwhile, Ripple executed substantial XRP transfers, totaling 90 million tokens, further fueling curiosity about the company's strategic moves. As XRP hovers around the critical $2.20 mark, analysts are closely monitoring its potential for recovery amid a volatile market landscape. Ripple CTO Sparks Speculation in the XRP Community with Cryptic Tweet Amid Major Price Activity Ripple Chief Technology Officer (CTO) David Schwartz has stirred a buzz within the XRP community following a thought-provoking tweet. The post, which cryptically highlighted a ‚Äú10x increase,‚Äù arrived shortly after XRP, the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, rallied nearly 13% over the weekend. The interplay between Schwartz‚Äôs tweet and recent market dynamics has fueled debates over the potential trajectory of XRP‚Äôs price. On Saturday, Schwartz tweeted a photo of a ‚ÄúPre-Mix Bubble Solution‚Äù can, which boasted of ‚Äú10x times the bubbles.‚Äù The Ripple CTO humorously called attention to the tautology in the phrase, suggesting that either ‚Äú10x‚Äù or ‚Äú10 times‚Äù would suffice. While seemingly innocuous, the post sparked a lively discussion in the XRP community, with some speculating whether the tweet hinted at a potential 10x price increase for XRP. Enthusiasts took to the comments, exploring the possibility of XRP reaching $10 or more in the near future. While Schwartz did not explicitly link the post to XRP‚Äôs price action, the timing of the tweet amidst XRP‚Äôs recent performance heightened the community‚Äôs curiosity. Adding to the intrigue, Ripple made significant XRP transfers over the weekend. Blockchain tracker Whale Alert flagged two substantial transactions totaling 90 million XRP, worth approximately $200 million. The first transfer, containing 50 million XRP valued at $111.7 million, and the second, with 40 million XRP worth $89.6 million, were both sent to anonymous wallets within a single minute. These transfers follow another weekend flurry of XRP activity, with Whale Alert identifying 182 million XRP moved in chunks of 99.9 million, 52.7 million, and 30 million XRP. The cumulative fiat value of these transfers is estimated at a staggering $411 million. The purpose behind these transactions remains unclear, sparking speculation about Ripple‚Äôs strategic intentions. Key Price Levels for XRP: Analyst Insights XRP‚Äôs recent market activity has drawn the attention of cryptocurrency analysts. Ali Martinez, a prominent crypto trader, highlighted $2.20 as a crucial price level for XRP. Martinez believes that the token must consolidate at this point before attempting to break through the $2.70 resistance level. Conversely, if XRP fails to maintain support at $2.20, Martinez warns that a decline to $1.96 could ensue. As of this writing, XRP is trading at $2.26, marking a period of sideways movement following a tumultuous week. The token experienced a sharp decline of 28% last week, falling from $2.71 to $1.96 before partially recovering over the weekend. The juxtaposition of Schwartz‚Äôs cryptic tweet, Ripple‚Äôs significant XRP transfers, and the token‚Äôs volatile price action has created a swirl of speculation among XRP investors. Some interpret the CTO‚Äôs ‚Äú10x times‚Äù tweet as an optimistic hint, while others remain cautious, focusing instead on the technical analysis that outlines potential support and resistance levels. Ripple‚Äôs large-scale movements also add to the narrative, with many wondering if the transfers signify preparations for institutional partnerships, market-making activities, or other strategic initiatives. As XRP hovers at the critical $2.26 mark, its next moves could set the tone for the coming weeks. A successful consolidation at this level might open the door to a rally toward $2.70, while failure to hold support could spell further declines. In the meantime, the XRP community remains watchful, dissecting every tweet, transfer, and chart for clues about the token‚Äôs future. Whether David Schwartz‚Äôs ‚Äú10x times‚Äù tweet was a clever observation or a subtle hint of what‚Äôs to come, one thing is clear: XRP continues to captivate the cryptocurrency world with its unpredictable moves and vibrant community discussions. XRP Emerges as the Most Traded Altcoin on Binance Amid Market Volatility Meanwhile, XRP has solidified its position as a standout performer on Binance this December, emerging as the most traded alternative cryptocurrency on the platform. According to data shared by CryptoQuant analyst JA Maartunn, the Ripple-linked token has generated a remarkable $116.6 million in trading volume on Binance Futures, outpacing other altcoins even amid widespread market declines. Despite a challenging trading environment characterized by substantial price drops for Bitcoin and other altcoins, XRP has managed to maintain a strong presence in the market. Earlier today, the cryptocurrency fell to an intraday low of $2.13, marking a decline of more than 4%, according to CoinGecko. This drop further extends XRP's descent, as the token is now down over 25% from its multi-year high of $2.85, achieved on Dec. 3. The earlier rally was largely driven by activity from Coinbase whales, who significantly boosted the token‚Äôs trading momentum. However, in the wake of this surge, XRP has faced downward pressure, underperforming relative to other major cryptocurrencies. XRP‚Äôs open interest stands at around $1.9 billion, showcasing the token‚Äôs robust activity in the derivatives market. Binance accounts for nearly half of this open interest, with $812 million, while Bitget and OKX hold the second and third spots. Recently, XRP generated an impressive $9.6 billion in trading volume, positioning it as the fifth most-traded cryptocurrency globally. It trailed only Bitcoin, Tether‚Äôs USDT, Ethereum, and USDC in terms of trading activity. Notably, during the peak of its December rally, XRP briefly flipped Bitcoin in trading volume on South Korean exchanges, underscoring its immense popularity in the region. This surge in activity was accompanied by a record high in Google search volume for XRP, although the heightened interest proved to be short-lived. Analysts Remain Optimistic About XRP‚Äôs Recovery JA Maartunn, the CryptoQuant analyst who highlighted XRP‚Äôs trading dominance, expressed confidence in the token's ability to recover ‚Äùrelatively quickly‚Äù from its current downturn. Despite recent losses, XRP's strong presence in the futures market and its position as a leading altcoin suggest a resilient investor base. The token‚Äôs recovery may also be supported by broader market trends and potential bullish catalysts in the coming years. In 2025, for example, XRP could benefit from the growing buzz around cryptocurrency ETFs in the United States. These developments are expected to bolster institutional adoption and liquidity for digital assets, potentially creating tailwinds for XRP. As 2024 draws to a close, XRP‚Äôs performance underscores both its potential and the challenges it faces in a highly volatile market. The token‚Äôs ability to dominate Binance‚Äôs trading volume reflects strong investor interest, but its recent price declines highlight the broader market‚Äôs fragility. Moving forward, XRP‚Äôs trajectory will likely depend on several factors, including market sentiment, regulatory developments, and its ability to capitalize on growing institutional interest in cryptocurrency. For now, the Ripple -linked token remains a focal point for traders and analysts alike, as it continues to navigate the highs and lows of the digital asset market.",POSITIVE,XRP,EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | XRP | ZRX,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6704/david-schwartz-s-10x-times-tweet-ignites-xrp-community-buzz,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png
38049450,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=375697,1735045107,Santa Claus Rally: Should I Buy High Tech Stocks or Crypto? (Op-Ed),"Despite the Federal Reserve‚Äôs recent rate cut by another quarter percentage on Wednesday, Bitcoin‚Äôs price plummeted. The asset tumbled by up to 15% at one point. Meanwhile, this all-important vital sign for the health of the Web3 blockchain economy remains down 3.5% for the 30 days ending Dec. 24. But it wasn‚Äôt just Bitcoin and crypto markets that slumped. Tech stocks in the NASDAQ Composite also tumbled 3% over the last five trading days on Wall Street. So, will there be a Santa Claus rally this year to save Christmas and Hanukkah from the Grinch? How High-Tech Nasdaq Stocks Do In Santa Rallies Most likely the dip in stocks and crypto over the last week was in part a simple matter of markets stopping to catch their breath. Both soared to record highs in the first half of the month. Dominic Pappalardo, chief multi-asset strategist at Morningstar Investment Management, says that these high valuations leave little room for error. He said , ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs extreme market reaction is being driven by today‚Äôs extremely rich valuations across risk assets.‚Äù Meanwhile, the Fed‚Äôs revised outlook expecting fewer cuts in the future after this most recent one in December may have dampened markets‚Äô enthusiasm. ‚ÄúThe move in equity markets can be attributed to the Fed‚Äôs updated outlook for fewer cuts in 2025,‚Äù Pappalardo said. There will probably be a Santa Claus rally this year. Historical data since 1950 shows that U.S. stocks have gotten this seasonal pick-me-up in 79% of the years. Historically, the average gain for stocks during this rally is around 1.3%. However, bear in mind that NASDAQ gains and losses are typically higher than those of the overall US stock market. Also, gains and losses for stocks since the pandemic have also exhibited a standard deviation higher than in most historical periods. How Cryptos Like Bitcoin Do on Holiday Pumps For cryptocurrency savers, investors, and day traders comparing high-tech stocks with Bitcoin and altcoins, it‚Äôs worth noting that historically, crypto also gets a Santa bump around the holidays. Moreover, the Santa Claus pump for crypto was often more pronounced than stock gains during this period. However, be forewarned that losses in altcoins can also outpace those of stocks when Krampus brings the coal to financial markets. Last year‚Äôs Santa rally saw a 4.87% rise in Bitcoin‚Äôs price, while the NASDAQ Composite increased by only 0.46%. The year before that, Bitcoin‚Äôs price fell by -0.61 while NASDAQ had notched a 0.04% gain. However, during the 2021 holidays, instead of a Santa rally, there was a Krampus slump. Bitcoin lost a markedly higher percentage than the NASDAQ. While tech stocks in this benchmark fell by -0.59%, Bitcoin capitulated by -6.8%. Bottom Line for Year-End Investors In 2024 Both tech stocks and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are enjoying a very robust rally that appears to many analysts poised to gain considerably more ground over the long term for these assets. During the last five days of December and the first two of January, there is usually a bump for stocks and cryptocurrencies. Whichever way markets go, Bitcoin usually goes further.

Tokens like PEPE showed how small amounts‚Äî$500, for example‚Äîturned into millions for first investors. Still, the emergence of Rexas Finance (RXS) is redefining this prospect. Rexas Finance distinguishes itself with its real-world utility, creative blockchain ideas, and active presale campaign, unlike speculative meme coins, which depend on community enthusiasm. Rexas Finance is positioned to become the next million-dollar investment opportunity when combining real-world asset tokenization's security and practicality with meme tokens' explosive growth potential. The Power of the Presale from Rexas Finance The presale of Rexas Finance has already attracted institutional investors as well as crypto aficionados worldwide. With 94.58% of tokens sold, the presale now in Stage 10 has reached an amazing milestone by exceeding $30 million out of its $33.1 million target. Valued at $0.15, each RXS token gives early investors a chance to protect their holdings before the price rises to $0.175 in the following stage. A $500 investment in RXS at this pricing point could yield life-changing profits. As demand for tokenized real-world assets skyrockets, analysts estimate that RXS might climb by 500% at launch and maybe provide gains reaching 10,000% over the long term. Time is running out for investors to enter the ground floor, with over 359 million tokens sold out. $1 Million Giveaway: Awards for Early Contributors Apart from its effective presale, Rexas Finance started an unparalleled $1 million campaign to honor its expanding ecosystem. Any cryptocurrency project depends on community involvement. Hence, this initiative honors its early backers and promotes this kind of participation. Each 20 winners will get RXS tokens valued at $50,000. Users only need to provide their ERC-20 wallet address and finish particular activities to join in. Referrals from friends increase participants' chances by getting extra entries for each one. As the project gets ready for its full release, this offering emphasizes Rexas Finance's dedication to returning benefits to its community and generates buzz and momentum. Ensuring Security and Reliability with CertiK Audit Rexas Finance and meme-based tokens like PEPE vary mostly in their focus on security. While many tokens are issued with little to no transparency, Rexas Finance has had a thorough, smart contract audit conducted by internationally known blockchain security company CertiK. The CertiK audit guarantees dependability, security, and vulnerability-free smart contracts for Rexas Finance. Knowing that the project runs on a solid and honest basis, this degree of openness and security gives investors peace of mind. Rexas Finance attracts not only institutional players seeking reputable blockchain projects but also regular investors by giving safety and dependability first priority. CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko Listings. Already reaching important benchmarks, Rexas Finance supports its leadership among crypto projects. Two of the most reliable sites for monitoring cryptocurrency performance, CoinMarketCap (CMC) and CoinGecko, now formally include the token. These postings offer numerous main advantages: Investors may readily track RXS's performance, price swings, and changes in direction. Legitimacy: A listing on CMC and CoinGecko lends legitimacy by demonstrating that Rexas Finance is a major and expanding initiative. Millions of daily visitors to these sites increase liquidity and interest in RXS tokens, therefore enhancing investor confidence. After its presale ends, Rexas Finance plans to list on tier-one centralized exchanges (CEXs), thus improving liquidity and stimulating even more demand. The Rexas Ecosystem: Utility-Driven Development The success of Rexas Finance is independent of just hype. Unlike speculative meme coins, RXS provides a strong ecosystem meant to transform investor access and management of actual assets via blockchain technology. The Rexas environment comprises: Rexas Token Builder: Designed to let anyone tokenize actual assets‚Äîsuch as real estate, companies, and commodities‚Äîwithout technical knowledge, it enables anyone.

38052482,https://cryptonews.com/?p=322300,1735044941,"BONK Targets 1 Trillion Burn by Christmas ‚Äì Could Prices Explode 328,000%?","Bonk has risen by 0.5% in the past 24 hours, with its move to $0.00003175 coming as the cryptocurrency market drops by 1% today. The meme coin is now down by 12% in a week and by 31% in a month, while it has also declined by 45% since reaching an all-time high of $0.00005825 on November 20. Yet signs suggest that Bonk is on the cusp of a big comeback, with its DAO announcing plans to burn at least 1 trillion BONK by December 25, as part of its ‚ÄòBURNmas‚Äô event. In fact, the BURNmas tracker now suggests that 1.6 trillion BONK is on course to burn, while its founder says that $0.11 is its long-term price target . BONK Targets 1 Trillion Burn by Christmas ‚Äì Could Prices Explode 328,000%? First announced via a November 15 blog post , BURNmas is a essentially a kind of publicity drive in which, in addition to all the burning, Bonk‚Äôs DAO and team are encouraging community members to draw attention to the token. 1,000,000,000,000 BONK WILL BE BURNED Get ready for BURNmas pic.twitter.com/5O6zxxV6QH ‚Äî BONK!!! (@bonk_inu) December 21, 2024 The way BURNmas works is that, for every tweet using the #LetsBONK hashtag, Bonk DAO will burn 100,000 BONK. So far it seems that the community has been exceeding expectations, with the projected burn total now standing at 1.6 trillion BONK. This amounts to 1.7% of the total BONK supply, and 2.2% of the circulating supply. Given that these are fairly modest percentages, it may come as little surprise to see that the BONK price hasn‚Äôt really reacted to BURNmas. If anything, it has gone down, in step with the wider market, which is nursing a post-election-rally hangover. Yet if we look at BONK‚Äôs chart today, we see that it may have touched an intermediate bottom, with its RSI (purple) beginning to pick up again after falling almost to 30 a few days ago. Source: TradingView At the same time, the coin‚Äôs 30-period average (orange) has potentially finished falling in relation to the 200-period average (blue), and we may see it climb further above the longer term indicator in the coming days and weeks. One area of concern, however, is that BONK‚Äôs trading volume remains low in relation to its peaks in November, at $300 million today. BONK founder says the goal is $0.11 SEND IT $BONK pic.twitter.com/B0lRk410H7 ‚Äî Cloudz (@FamousCloudzz) December 21, 2024 Yet the inauguration of Donald Trump next month could provide the wider market with another lift, while subsequent months may see the arrival of crypto-friendly legislation . In such a context, BONK may return to $0.000050 by Q1 2025, before reaching $0.00010 by Q2. New Meme Tokens with Strong Fundamentals Traders skeptical about BONK may prefer to investigate newer tokens, particularly low-cap coins that are still looking forwards to enjoying their initial breakout gains. Identifying such coins can be tricky, but one way of narrowing down the field is to look for a popular presale coins, which can often rally strongly when they list. One token on course to do this is Flockerz (FLOCK), an ERC-20 coin that has raised $7.7 million in its ongoing sale.

Given that all governance decisions will be put to the community, holders of FLOCK could therefore end up earning a tidy sum from the new coin. Not only that, but holders will be able to stake the token, earning a passive income on top of any governance rewards.

Named after veteran analyst Tom DeMark, the TD Sequential indicates the reversal of an ongoing trend, with PEPE‚Äôs TD Sequential showing signs of a turnaround after several consecutive periods of declines. At $0.00001824, PEPE‚Äôs recent struggles have seen it lose 23% in a week and 29% in a fortnight, although its long-term price predictions look much more encouraging. And with its trading volume remaining high at over $2 billion, it looks ready to rebound after a difficult period of profit-taking. PEPE Price Set to Explode? $2.6 Billion Volume and ‚ÄòTD Sequential‚Äô Signal Massive Rebound Posting on X, cryptocurrency trader and analyst Ali Martinez noted that PEPE‚Äôs daily chart has flashed a buy signal, in the form of its TD Sequential turning positive. The TD Sequential presented a buy signal on the $PEPE daily chart, anticipating a price rebound! pic.twitter.com/4RUjW1kmwp ‚Äî Ali (@ali_charts) December 22, 2024 Basically, the TD Sequential states that the completion of nine progressively lower (or higher) price candles indicates an incoming bullish (or bearish) reversal. And in the case of PEPE, its completion of a TD Sequential suggests that it has re-entered a growth phase, as is also signalled by other indicators. For instance, its chart today shows that its 30-period average (orange) is climbing steadily towards its 200-period average (blue), hinting that the coin is getting close to a breakout. Source: TradingView Something similar is happening with its relative strength index (purple), which after spending a few days oscillating below 50 looks to have cleared this level. In other words, PEPE has begun to enter a more bullish period, as suggested by its TD Sequential. Its trading volume also remains encouraging, which at $2.4 billion suggests that traders are still very much bullish for the token. While we haven‚Äôt witnessed any big PEPE buys in the past few days, this month has seen whales step up their accumulation of the coin, as indicated by transfer data . And given that it continues to attract attention, many analysts expect it to be one of 2025‚Äôs big performers. $PEPE Is Looking To Round Out The Year Strong Whales Continuing To Show Big Interest Q1 2025 We Could See A Massive Parabolic Run In The Crypto Market Latest #PEPE News And Price Update pic.twitter.com/kvVAgK8KMy ‚Äî Crypto Zeus (@CryptoZeusYT) December 24, 2024 It should continue to rise along with the wider market, particularly as the new Trump administration and Republican-controlled Congress pass pro-crypto legislation . In this more favorable context, the PEPE price could reach $0.000025 by the end of January, and $0.000035 by Q2 2025. New PEPE Tokens with Promising Fundamentals The market is flooded with meme tokens, including Pepe-themed tokens that look at ape the runaway success of PEPE. Many such coins are likely to be risky as investments, but there are ways of identifying the more promising examples among them, before they rally. Probably the best way of doing this is to look for the biggest and most popular presales, since successful raises usually translate into strong listings and successful coins in general. And of all the new presales this year, the biggest belongs to Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) , an ERC-20 token that has raised a huge $35.5 million in its sale. $35M raised. Frogs are thriving.

And that‚Äôs because WEPE isn‚Äôt simply another utility-free meme coin, but also a platform that will provide traders with analysis and market insights. WEPE holders will gain exclusive access to Wall Street Pepe‚Äôs real-time buying signals and insider trading strategies, helping them to stay ahead of the fickle cryptocurrency market. Wall Street Pepe will also have its own community forums and spaces, where users can share tips and analysis, while also competing in trading competitions. The platform will reward winners of these contests with WEPE, incentivizing greater engagement among its community. And even now, Wall Street Pepe has a strong and growing following, with its X account reaching over 27,000 followers . Investors can get involved in its sale by going to its official website , where WEPE is available at $0.0003654. This will rise later today, while it will continue to rise incrementally as the sale progresses. Traders should therefore act quickly, especially if WEPE is going to rocket when it lists next year.

This project is now in presale, so its price is also low. Table of Contents Remittix to rule the cross-border payments sector Analyst says the price of Solana will rise soon Can Remittix surge 4,500% faster than Solana? The crypto market is filled with projects that show great growth potential. One such project is Solana (SOL), which has gained tons of attention due to its YTD price surge. There‚Äôs a new player in the space called Remittix (RTX) , a new presale sensation. This altcoin is being compared to Solana as a cheaper alternative. Predictions suggest a further increase of 4500% by 2025. Remittix to rule the cross-border payments sector Remittix is becoming more desirable in the crypto market, just like Solana was. This newcomer is now in its presale, which has seen over 10m RTX tokens sold so far. Interest in this altcoin is sky-high thanks to Remittix‚Äôs long-term vision. This project aims to combine Fiat cross-border payments with blockchain technology. This market was valued at $206b in 2024 and is predicted to reach $295B by 2029, as per Mordor Intelligence . Remittix is strategically positioning itself to capitalize on its growth potential. As an upcoming crypto-to-fiat network platform, here are some noteworthy features that will set it apart from its rivals: Remittix Pay API: Remittix will allow businesses to accept crypto coin payments from their customers. Simplicity: Recipients will get a bank transfer without knowing it started as a crypto payment. Flat Fees: No extra charges for FX, wires, or hidden costs on Remittix. The RTX token will power this network. Holding this token will give users governance, voting rights, and more. Currently, one RTX costs only $0.0156. This altcoin price could rise to $0.0163 after the next stage starts. Not only that, a Tier-1 crypto exchange listing is expected to push this value to $0.10 ‚Äì a 566% return for all those who buy RTX now. Analyst says the price of Solana will rise soon Solana is among the top crypto coins as its price has grown tremendously. CoinMarketCap shows that the Solana price moved between around $70 and over $210 in the past 12 months. In other words, this is a 200% rise for this altcoin on the yearly chart. Crypto analyst Johnny also made headlines with his Solana price prediction. In a recent X post , he told his followers that many people will soon remove their bearish views on this crypto coin. As a price target, he foresees growth to $250 for Solana soon. The technicals for the Solana crypto are also showing some good signs. TradingView shows that the altcoin is valued above its 100-day EMA ($186). Also, its bull-bear power sits at -8.11 which is in the buy zone and suggests bulls could push its value up. Can Remittix surge 4,500% faster than Solana? Although Solana has seen good price gains in the past year, experts think its high market cap of $100B may hinder its growth. This means that SOL will need a lot of new money for its price to rise. Moreover, many think this altcoin may have already experienced its highest upswings. Because of all these reasons, experts are now turning to Remittix. This newcomer will have a smaller market cap than SOL, which means faster price growth with less money. Its features could make it a fan-favorite for millions of individuals, especially in underbanked regions. Therefore, they predict a potential 4,500% surge for this altcoin in 2025.

38048966,https://crypto.news/?p=14321895,1735044159,AI crypto market cap up over 25% amid major developments in the sector,"Artificial Intelligence-related cryptocurrencies saw a significant rally over the past day as several new developments surrounding the AI industry reignited interest among its investors. NEAR Protocol NEAR Protocol ( NEAR ), the largest AI coin by market cap, rose 6% in the last 24 hours, trading at $5.45 per coin at press time. Internet Computer Internet Computer ( ICP ), Render ( RENDER ), Bittensor ( TAO ), and FET hit gains of 5.2%, 7.6%, 7.5% and 4% respectively in the same period. Meanwhile, other AI tokens Livepeer ( LPT ), Virtuals Protocol ( VIRTUAL ), AI Rig Complex (ARC) and PAAL AI (PAAL) recorded much higher gains of 20.7%, 20.5%, 19.5%, and 16.7% respectively. All these gains across AI-related helped push the total AI coins market cap up 25% standing at $43.5 billion at the time of writing. The AI sector surged after President-elect Donald Trump revealed White House advisory appointees who will work alongside the incoming AI & Crypto Czar, David Sacks , to centralize artificial intelligence policy and reinforce the nation‚Äôs leadership in transformative technologies. You might also like: Binance survey: 45% new users joined in 2024, AI tokens heralded as most popular pick to lead 2025 The announcement, made across two Truth Social posts on Dec. 23, included the appointment of Sriram Krishnan as senior policy advisor for Artificial Intelligence, a newly created role within the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Further, Michael Kratsios was named Director of the OSTP, while Lynne Parker was appointed executive director of the Presidential Council of Advisors for Science and Technology‚Äîtwo offices that predate the Trump administration. Both Kratsios and Parker have previously played key roles in advancing the AI industry in their respective positions. The appointment of AI experts to key positions in the Trump administration has likely strengthened investor confidence in the future of the AI industry. AI-related crypto assets often experience rallies in response to positive developments and bullish news within the AI sector. Another key factor likely supporting the recent surge in AI tokens is the major funding announcement from xAI, the AI startup founded by billionaire Elon Musk. On Monday, the company revealed that it had secured $6 billion in its latest funding round bringing its total valuation to over $40 billion. xAI said that the newly raised funds, which included participation from chip-making giants NVIDIA and AMD, will be allocated toward building advanced AI infrastructure and enhancing the development of its flagship models. As reported by crypto.news earlier, AI tokens previously reached an all-time high on Nov. 28, following an exceptionally bullish quarterly sales report from AI chip-making giant Nvidia, which surpassed market expectations.

38051577,https://invezz.com/?p=2403200,1735044074,Russia enforces six-year ban on crypto mining in 10 regions: here‚Äôs why,"Cryptocurrency miners in Russia will face restrictions across multiple regions as the government has decided to impose a ban on mining activities in 10 territories. According to a December 24 report from the state-owned news agency TASS , the Russian Cabinet of Ministers approved the ban, impacting the regions of Dagestan, Ingushetia, Kabardino-Balkaria, Karachay-Cherkessia, North Ossetia, Chechnya, Donetsk and Lugansk People‚Äôs Republics, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson. Starting January 1, 2025, and effective until March 15, 2031, crypto miners in these regions will be prohibited from conducting cryptocurrency mining operations, participating in mining pools, and engaging in any related activities. Beyond this, some areas like Irkutsk, Buryatia, and Zabaikalsky will face seasonal restrictions on mining activities when electricity consumption peaks. Notably, the restrictions will be applicable from January 1 to March 15 initially and will be extended in subsequent years to cover the period from November 15 to March 15. However, the report noted that the list is not final and could be adjusted as the government sees fit. Initially, regulators were considering a complete ban across 13 regions including crypto mining hotspots like Irkutsk. With this move, Russia plans to reduce the strain on regional power grids, address electricity shortages, and tackle the economic imbalance caused by cross-subsidization. Cross-subsidization occurs when low electricity tariffs in energy-intensive regions, often benefiting crypto miners, are offset by higher costs paid by consumers and industries in other regions. This creates an unequal financial burden, with central and industrialized regions effectively subsidizing the discounted electricity consumed by mining operations. Sergey Kolobanov, Deputy Head of the Central Strategic Research Department of Fuel and Energy Complex Economy, told TASS that the timing of the restrictions aligns with the government‚Äôs plan to phase out these subsidies. According to him, once the electricity market is liberalized and sufficient energy capacity is ensured, the ban could potentially be lifted. Regulating the Russian crypto mining sector The ban comes as a part of new legislation signed by President Vladimir Putin on November 1 that allows the government to restrict mining activity in certain regions while putting in place protocols for implementing these measures. Russia had already initiated crackdowns on unauthorized crypto-mining activities even before the latest regulations came into force. As previously reported by Invezz, in October, the Ministry of Internal Affairs conducted raids on locals using subsidized electricity to illegally mine cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, Russia has also started taxing cryptocurrency earned from mining as income in kind. The law was signed by Putin on November 29, and mining income is taxed under a progressive scale, with rates of 13% for income up to 2.4 million rubles and 15% for income exceeding this threshold.

USUAL is a decentralized stablecoin issuer that claims to redefine the financial landscape through real-world asset (RWA) integration and decentralized governance. USUAL‚Äôs approach to stablecoin issuance, particularly through tokenized U.S. Treasury Bills (T-Bills) and user-governed protocols, aims to challenge the traditional stablecoin giants such as Tether (USDT) and Circle (USDC) through their wealth redistribution and community ownership approach. OKX Ventures Invests in USUAL We‚Äôre excited to announce our investment in @usualmoney , a decentralized stablecoin protocol that‚Äôs redefining the future of finance! With its novel approach to integrating RWAs & DeFi, USUAL is creating a more equitable, decentralized‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/ulZpeGiJxr ‚Äî OKX Ventures (@OKX_Ventures) December 24, 2024 OKX Ventures Invests In USUAL: Is This The Next Big Stablecoin? USUAL‚Äôs flagship product, USD0, is fully collateralized by T-Bills, providing stability and security comparable to traditional financial instruments. Unlike centralized stablecoins, USUAL operates on a permissionless, decentralized framework where governance is driven by its native token, $USUAL. Token holders participate in decision-making and share in the economic benefits of the stablecoin‚Äôs expansion, effectively turning users into co-owners of the protocol. The journey of USUAL began with a vision to reimagine stablecoin issuance by embedding real-world financial assets directly into DeFi protocols. USUAL has successfully integrated tokenized T-Bills into its collateral pool by securing partnerships with leading financial entities such as BlackRock and Hashnote. USUAL has also aligned itself with prominent DeFi platforms, including Curve, Pendle, Morpho, and Ether.fi, which has allowed the protocol to expand its liquidity strategies and yield optimization models. This synergy has enabled USUAL to achieve significant milestones, including surpassing $1.4 billion in total value locked (TVL) and securing a position among the top five stablecoins in market capitalization. Source: Defillama The stablecoin‚Äôs market capitalization currently stands at $625 million, with a trading volume of $968 million in the past 24 hours. According to Coingecko, today, the USUAL native token price surged by 21.3%, reaching $1.32 in the past 24 hours. Source: CoinGecko This growth has positioned USUAL as the fastest-growing fiat-backed stablecoin on Ethereum. This is particularly noteworthy as stablecoin supply in Ethereum Layer 2s recently reached $13.5 Billion . This latest investment reflects a broader industry trend toward integrating RWAs into DeFi to bridge the gap between traditional finance and decentralized ecosystems. Strategic Investments Amid Growing Stablecoin Market Notably, USUAL‚Äôs trajectory was also significantly boosted with a $10 million Series A funding round led by Binance Labs and Kraken Ventures, alongside investments from Galaxy Ventures, Coinbase Ventures, and OKX Ventures. Pierre Person, CEO and Co-Founder of USUAL Labs emphasized that this funding round marks a pivotal moment for the project, positioning it as one of the most promising projects in stablecoin and DeFi sectors for 2024. He further said: ‚ÄúThis milestone will propel Usual‚Äôs expansion from DeFi into CeFi, with the support of backers who are committed to reshaping the stablecoin landscape.‚Äù Adli Takkal Bataille, Co-Founder and DEO of USUAL Labs, also highlighted the protocol‚Äôs innovative value redistribution model. According to Bataille: ‚ÄúWe are bringing fiat-backed stablecoins into the DeFi era, the next phase of our journey will accelerate this transformation, creating unprecedented opportunities for users.‚Äù USUAL‚Äôs community-first approach is further exemplified by its commitment to allocate 90% of its token supply to users. This model contrasts sharply with traditional stablecoin projects, where profits are centralized within the issuing company. The stablecoin market is seeing significant growth, with giants like Ripple also looking to capitalize on it with its recently launched stablecoin called RLUSD . Ethena Labs also recently launched its USDtb stablecoin backed by BlackRock Liquidity Fund.

38049148,https://thecoinrise.com/massive-60m-xrp-whale-transfer-fuels-market-speculation/,1735044001,Massive 60M XRP Whale Transfer Fuels Market Speculation,"A colossal transfer of 60 million XRP tokens, valued at over $132 million, between two unidentified wallets has captured the attention of the crypto market. Reported by blockchain tracker Whale Alert, the transaction has ignited discussions among market analysts about potential price movements, with some predicting a bullish rally for the digital asset. Market analyst EGRAG Crypto highlighted the possibility of XRP reaching $27, citing the token‚Äôs Break of Structure (BOS) level and alignment with the 21 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) as key indicators for a potential breakout. These metrics, often associated with bullish trends, have added fuel to speculation about XRP‚Äôs future trajectory . Adding to the excitement, data from CryptoQuant reveals that XRP has become the most traded altcoin on Binance‚Äôs futures market this December, amassing $116.6 million in trading volume. This heightened activity, analysts suggest, could indicate growing interest in XRP, possibly tied to the anticipated ‚ÄúSanta Claus rally‚Äù that historically boosts market sentiment during the holiday season. Mixed Signals for XRP‚Äôs Short-Term Outlook While long-term optimism surrounds XRP, short-term indicators suggest a cautious approach. The daily chart shows a descending triangle pattern, which typically signals bearish pressure. Support is holding at $2.19, but a breach could lead to a drop as low as $1.69, according to TradingView analysts. On the flip side, breaking past the $2.50 resistance could invalidate bearish forecasts and set XRP on a path to retest its recent high of $2.90. Market observers are also eyeing on-chain data from Messari, which indicates profit-taking by XRP holders with balances exceeding one million tokens. This activity has added downward pressure to XRP‚Äôs price during its consolidation phase. What Lies Ahead? Notably, traders have drawn parallels between XRP‚Äôs current price behavior and its 2017 bull run. Analyst Crypto Vilian suggested that XRP‚Äôs current trajectory of decline, recovery, and consolidation mirrors its pre-breakout pattern from 2017, raising hopes for a similar explosive rally. The broader market environment, particularly Bitcoin‚Äôs performance, will likely play a pivotal role in shaping XRP‚Äôs near-term fate. Additionally, legal developments in Ripple‚Äôs SEC case and the expected departure of SEC Chair Gary Gensler in January could serve as catalysts for major market movement. For now, the crypto community remains on edge, watching for the next ripple in XRP‚Äôs journey.

With the recent decline in Bitcoin, the XRP price fell to the $ 2 limit, while XRP broke a record in another area. Accordingly, XRP became the most traded altcoin on Binance in December. This increase came at a time when XRP hit a three-year high. CryptoQunant analyst revealed that XRP is the most traded altcoin on the Binance Futures market. The analyst noted that XRP currently has a trading volume of 116.6 billion, adding that December is not over yet. Stating that it is important to follow the most traded altcoins on Binance, the analyst said: ‚ÄúXRP is the most traded altcoin on Binance Futures, currently with a trading volume of 116.6 billion and the month is not even over yet.

Gox is back, and this time it‚Äôs moving mountains of Bitcoins. The long-defunct crypto exchange has transferred 3,631.87 Bitcoins‚Äîworth $364 million‚Äîto market maker B2C2 Group. Since December 5, Mt. Gox has been methodically sending between 200 and 300 BTC each working day. Mt. Gox Bitcoin transfers to B2C2 Group. Bitcoin‚Äôs holiday blues While Mt. Gox is busy moving Bitcoins, the market itself is caught in a downward spiral. Bitcoin‚Äôs price tanked to $92,442 on December 23, the lowest it‚Äôs been in four weeks. That‚Äôs a brutal 14.5% drop from its all-time high of $108,000 just days earlier, on December 17. If you were hoping for a rebound, don‚Äôt hold your breath. Bitcoin briefly recovered to $95,000, only to slide back to $94,000 during early trading on Christmas Eve. It‚Äôs been a rough week, with the coin down over 11%. Let‚Äôs talk about the so-called ‚ÄúSanta Claus rally.‚Äù Historically, crypto investors have counted on a holiday surge during the last five trading days of December through the first two of January. But December‚Äôs slump has left any hopes of a rally in the dust, dashing dreams of the festive gains we‚Äôve seen in bull markets of the past. Percentage change in total crypto market cap in December 2014 ‚Äì 2023. Between 2014 and 2023, the crypto market staged post-Christmas rallies 8 out of 10 times. Market capitalization gains ranged from modest bumps of 0.69% to impressive jumps of 11.87%. The pre-Christmas rally? Not so reliable. In those same years, data shows that only five December lead-ups delivered gains. The biggest pre-Christmas rally happened in 2016, with an 11.56% increase. The worst? 2017, when the market collapsed by 12.12%, thanks to the ICO boom-and-bust chaos. Crypto‚Äôs love-hate relationship with December The so-called ‚ÄúSanta Claus effect‚Äù in crypto is like flipping a coin. Sometimes you win big, sometimes you don‚Äôt. Over the last decade, December has given us both incredible rallies and painful crashes. In five of those years, total market capitalization surged between 16.08% and 94.19%. In the other five, December delivered pullbacks ranging from 1.73% to 15.56%. It‚Äôs a volatile season for traders, to say the least. Bitcoin has delivered holiday miracles in seven of the last 10 years, with pre-Christmas gains ranging from 0.20% to 13.19%. But when it‚Äôs bad, it‚Äôs really bad. Take 2017, when Bitcoin nosedived by 21.30% in the week before Christmas. And while post-Christmas rallies are less frequent, they can still be powerful. The largest? A 10.86% surge in 2020. The smallest? A 0.33% nudge in 2018. Bitcoin‚Äôs average December performance outshines its specific holiday-week rallies, with an average return of 9.48%. That‚Äôs at least seven times more than the gains seen during pre- and post-Christmas trades combined. But don‚Äôt let these numbers fool you into thinking there‚Äôs a pattern.

38048800,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53023,1735043409,P2pb2b Scam: Investors Warned After Fraudulent Exchange Activities,"A heartbreaking story has emerged about a trader who lost his child‚Äôs cancer treatment money to the p2pb2b scam. ( https://x.com/vtcnstrctn34/status/1871272169340125655 ) This whole ordeal shows how fraudulent cryptocurrency exchanges can destroy lives. The trader‚Äôs story is just one of many allegations against P2pb2b, which faces intense scrutiny for suspected fraud. Investigators have found troubling issues with P2pb2b‚Äôs scam operations. Users cannot withdraw their money, customer funds have vanished, and the company‚Äôs business practices look suspicious. Many people have lost their savings, and evidence links the exchange to international criminal networks. Both cryptocurrency experts and regulatory bodies now strongly warn investors to stay away from this platform. Investigation Reveals Widespread Fraud P2pb2b scam operations show a clear pattern of systemic fraud that affects thousands of users around the world. The peer-to-peer payments sector experienced a staggering 90% jump in fraud losses during 2022, reaching $1.70 billion. P2pb2b‚Äôs activities have substantially contributed to these alarming numbers. Pattern of Missing Customer Funds Deceptive schemes have caused users to lose substantial amounts of money. A heartbreaking example shows a trader who lost money meant for their child‚Äôs cancer treatment. The exchange keeps freezing user assets without any clear explanations. P2pb2b runs its operations with minimal oversight from regulators, which makes fraudulent activities easier to conduct without checks. Withdrawal Blockages and Delays P2pb2b has made withdrawal delays a standard part of its operations. Users can‚Äôt access their funds on time, especially when they have large transactions. Many withdrawal requests stay pending for months while the exchange makes excuses about technical problems. These delays often lead to complete account freezes that leave investors helpless. False Marketing Claims The exchange uses several deceptive marketing strategies: Creates fake trading volumes to show false liquidity Shows fake team member profiles to appear credible Makes unrealistic promises about trading benefits and returns Research shows that P2pb2b‚Äôs trading volumes don‚Äôt reflect reality. More than 51% of reported crypto trading volume on exchanges lacks economic value or is fake. This wash trading creates an illusion of market activity to trap unsuspecting investors. Victim Testimonials and Losses P2pb2b exchange users have suffered crushing financial losses. The cryptocurrency sector saw fraud cases jump by 90% in 2022. Thousands of users worldwide faced damages at levels never seen before. Personal Stories of Financial Impact The financial toll on traders has been severe. Indian users saw their accounts completely frozen, and some have waited over two years for resolution. One trader lost 600,000 rupees through a fraudulent transaction. Another user had to pay large sums just to access their frozen account again. Documentation of Stolen Assets The platform‚Äôs victims have uncovered evidence of systematic theft through various channels. They documented: Unauthorized account freezes Unexplained withdrawal blockages Missing transaction records Manipulated trading histories Total Estimated Damages The losses have grown to massive levels. P2P fraud losses reached $1.70 billion in 2022, almost ten times higher than 2018 figures. Elderly users suffered the most, with their median losses two to three times higher than younger users. Money loss analysis shows: P2P payment app fraud has hit 8% of banking customers Users lost an average of $700 per incident in similar platform scams Banks rarely reimburse victims, leaving them with little recourse These losses go beyond just money. Victims deal with mental stress, disrupted businesses, and long legal fights to recover their assets. Many users still struggle with frozen accounts and lost funds, even after complaining to regulatory authorities. Regulatory Red Flags P2pb2b‚Äôs operations have raised significant regulatory concerns . Multiple financial authorities have flagged the exchange for non-compliance and suspicious activities . Lack of Proper Licensing P2pb2b runs its operations without proper regulatory permissions in major jurisdictions. The exchange lacks significant registrations with the core team of financial authorities. These include the UK‚Äôs Financial Conduct Authority, Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission, and USA‚Äôs Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. The platform has listed conflicting jurisdictional information and claims authority in England and Wales without having registered presence there. Non-Compliance with AML Requirements The exchange shows major anti-money laundering compliance failures: MoonPay allows cryptocurrency purchases up to $12,000 and Simplex up to $20,000 before KYC Users can make unlimited cryptocurrency deposits without KYC verification User verification processes and transaction monitoring remain below standards The platform fails to follow European data protection regulations History of Regulatory Warnings The British Columbia Securities Commission (BCSC) has warned users about P2pb2b‚Äôs unauthorized operations. The platform‚Äôs status dropped to ‚ÄúRed Compliance‚Äù due to multiple violations. Financial intelligence units have found concerning patterns such as: Unauthorized security token listings Operations through multiple shell companies Links to questionable payment processors The exchange faces more problems after authorities found its connection with REAL-TOK , an unauthorized security token that regulators classify as potentially fraudulent. These violations have brought increased attention from international financial regulators who continue to warn potential investors. Warning Signs and Prevention Crypto investors must watch out for fraudulent exchanges that use complex tricks to deceive them. Scammers in the crypto space caused losses of $1.70 billion in 2022. This makes it vital to verify exchanges carefully before trading. Common Deception Tactics Scam exchanges use several sophisticated tricks to fool their users. These platforms make their trading volumes look bigger to seem legitimate. They lure victims with promises of guaranteed returns that are too good to be true. Many fake platforms boost their numbers through multiple fake accounts to look popular. Watch out for these red flags: Missing KYC protocols and regulatory compliance Promises of guaranteed high returns that seem unrealistic Little or no documentation about operations Inflated trading volumes Team profiles you can‚Äôt verify Due Diligence Checklist Every crypto investor should complete these steps before using an exchange: Check if they have proper licenses and follow regulations Look up the team‚Äôs background and credentials Make sure they have 2FA and cold storage security See how open they are about their operations Test how fast their support team responds Look at what real users say about their experience Safe Trading Alternatives The best exchanges have reliable security measures and follow regulations. Legitimate platforms put lots of resources into security features like two-factor authentication, cold storage, and strong encryption. They‚Äôre open about their team, company history, and where they‚Äôre located. Traders should follow these rules to stay safe: Get wallet apps only from official sources Keep private keys in a secure place Test the waters with small trades first Choose platforms that follow regulations Check all security features before adding funds The crypto community helps spot and report shady platforms quickly. Recent events, like when a trader lost their cancer treatment money to p2pb2b, show why it‚Äôs important to check everything before using any exchange platform. Conclusion P2pb2b has devastated the cryptocurrency community with its fraudulent activities that caused massive unprecedented losses. Thousands of users around the world have suffered from the exchange‚Äôs deceptive practices ‚Äì from fake trading volumes to withdrawal blocks. The theft of cancer treatment funds stands out as a particularly tragic example that shows the human toll of these crypto scams. Red flags about P2pb2b‚Äôs operations have emerged from regulatory authorities everywhere. They point to major compliance violations and questionable activities consistently. Cryptocurrency traders face big risks because the exchange lacks proper licenses and adequate security measures. These problems match the broader trend that shows peer-to-peer payment fraud has jumped 90%. Traders need to carefully choose their trading platforms. A complete check of exchange credentials, compliance status, and security features helps ensure safe trading. The crypto community‚Äôs constant alertness and proper background checks remain the best protection against fraudulent exchanges that put investor assets at risk. FAQs Q1. What are the warning signs of a fraudulent cryptocurrency exchange? Common red flags include lack of proper licensing, non-compliance with AML requirements, unrealistic promises of high returns, artificial inflation of trading volumes, and poor customer support. Always verify an exchange‚Äôs regulatory status and security measures before trading. Q2. Can I recover my funds if I‚Äôve been scammed by a cryptocurrency exchange? Unfortunately, recovering funds lost to cryptocurrency scams is extremely difficult. Bitcoin transactions are irreversible, and there‚Äôs no central authority to provide refunds. Your best option is to report the incident to law enforcement with as much information as possible about the scammer. Q3. How can I protect myself from P2P cryptocurrency scams? To protect yourself, only use reputable exchanges with proper licensing and security features. Conduct thorough research, verify the platform‚Äôs team and background, and start with small test transactions. Always maintain your private keys securely and be wary of unrealistic promises or pressure to invest quickly. Q4. What should I do if I suspect a cryptocurrency exchange is fraudulent? If you suspect fraud, immediately stop all transactions with the exchange. Document all your interactions and gather evidence of suspicious activities. Report the exchange to relevant financial authorities and consider sharing your experience with the cryptocurrency community to warn others. Q5. How prevalent are cryptocurrency scams? Cryptocurrency scams have seen a significant increase in recent years. In 2022, peer-to-peer payment fraud losses reached $1.70 billion, marking a 90% increase from previous years. This highlights the importance of vigilance and proper due diligence when engaging in cryptocurrency trading. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release for informational purposes only.

As the end of 2024 approaches, investors' expectations for a new year rally have decreased, while QCP Capital analysts have listed their Bitcoin and altcoin expectations. Analysts at Singapore-based cryptocurrency trading firm QCP Capital have stated that there will be fluctuations in the BTC price as a significant option expiration in Bitcoin next week will affect market dynamics. Analysts stated that the price fluctuation in Bitcoin will have a positive impact on altcoins, and that investors expect a possible return from BTC to altcoins. ‚ÄúAll eyes will be on Bitcoin and Ethereum options this Friday when approximately $20 billion will expire. This represents almost half of the total OI on Deribit.‚Äù Analysts who stated that the troubles in Bitcoin would trigger the rise of altcoins argued that BTC's struggle to stay above $ 100,000 could pave the way for an altcoin rally. ‚ÄúAs Bitcoin continues to struggle below 100K, we could see altcoins start to rally again.‚Äù Bitcoin's Declines May Continue! Alex Kuptsikevich from FxPro warned traders that further declines are possible for BTC, with potential drops to $90,000 or even $70,000. The analyst added that a possible pullback in Bitcoin to $90,000 could present an attractive buying opportunity for investors. ‚ÄúIn a potential shock scenario for Bitcoin, the price could suddenly drop to the $70,000 region. However, a pullback to $90,000 in the next few weeks could present a good buying opportunity to buyers. Markets continue to digest Fed's tougher tone.‚Äù *This is not investment advice.

38059375,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=106183,1735043235,"Here‚Äôs Why XRP May Never See $100, $300, or $500","XRP is one of the cryptocurrencies that holders harbor overly optimistic expectations for, largely due to its unique position in the market. While XRP currently trades around $2, some analysts speculate about a future where XRP could reach the double-digit range of $10 to $20 . This prospect has gained some reasonable acceptance within the community, with some suggesting it could happen by 2025.Meanwhile, some analysts have even predicted a price beyond triple digits, surpassing $100 for XRP.Several factors fuel this ambitious outlook, including XRP's unique position in the crypto market, legal clarity, use cases in the multi-trillion-dollar financial system, institutional adoption, and historical performance.While some argue that XRP could surpass $100 by 2025, citing historical trends and other factors, these projections often overlook a crucial aspect of the price prediction.The Supply ConundrumXRP has a total supply of 100 billion tokens, with nearly 57.3 billion currently in circulation. For XRP to reach $100, its market capitalization would need to soar to $5.73 trillion.This valuation exceeds the entire cryptocurrency market's current capitalization of around $3.3 trillion. Similarly, reaching $300 or $500 would require even higher market caps, potentially rivaling or surpassing the total value of global assets like gold, which is currently valued at about $17 trillion.These figures highlight a key limitation. While the price predictions may generate excitement within the community, the sheer scale of market capitalization required for XRP to achieve these targets is not aligned with current and foreseeable market dynamics.Even with Ripple‚Äôs expanding utility in cross-border payments and partnerships with banks, XRP's price is constrained by practical factors.Furthermore, market caps of this scale assume no sell pressure or profit-taking from current holders, which is an unrealistic scenario in an active and volatile market.So, When Could XRP Reach $100, $300, or $500?Grok AI estimates that XRP could reach $100 by 2028, assuming improvements in liquidity, partnerships, and regulatory clarity. For XRP to hit $500, Grok AI predicts this milestone could be reached beyond 2030, contingent on widespread adoption in global payments.On the other hand, ChatGPT forecasts that XRP might reach $100 within five years under an optimistic scenario. In a more conservative scenario, this could happen in 7 to 10 years. As for $500, ChatGPT expects it could take 10 years in an optimistic scenario or more than 15 years in a conservative one.Meanwhile, analysts at Telegaon suggest that XRP could hit $100 by 2040, which would be 16 years from now. However, they do not foresee XRP reaching $300 or $500 in the foreseeable future.",NEGATIVE,XRP,FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/24/heres-why-xrp-may-never-see-100-300-or-500/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=heres-why-xrp-may-never-see-100-300-or-500,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

However, in the memecoin niche things are a lot worse, with losses amounting to 40-60%. $DOGE, $PEPE, and $BONK are analysed as to their potential recoveries. For the altcoin investor things have been pretty bleak over the last couple of weeks. With Bitcoin ($BTC) struggling to turn its current reversal around , the altcoins have fared worse as usual. However, for those sitting in memecoin positions, the stress of seeing a reduction of at least 40% over the last two weeks must be difficult to bear. Clear support and a bounce for $DOGE Source: TradingView The weekly chart for $DOGE (DOGE/USDT) shows a very clear picture. It can be seen that the spectacular rise from $0.08 in early August reached the 0.618 Fibonacci at $0.47 in November. Such a massive price rise really did need a correction, so over the last couple of weeks a dip of 43% did much to help the market absorb the preceding rise. The fact that this dip went down to touch an ascending trendline which began in late 2022 is very bullish. The $DOGE price is currently sitting on strong horizontal support that coincides with the 0.382 Fibonacci. Upside target levels are in the chart above. $PEPE buoyed up by strong horizontal support Source: TradingView $PEPE (PEPE/USDT) has seen a lot of volatility over recent weeks. A textbook bull flag broke out and the price looked to be heading skyward. However, a consequent dump took the price all the way back to touch and confirm the bottom of the flag. This amounted to a 49% reversal from the top. Currently, the price is starting to climb from the strong horizontal support at $0.000017. If the $PEPE price can climb back out of the flag, bulls would then have to keep their eye on a potential future head and shoulders reversal pattern. If this can be avoided, the all-time high at $0.000028 would be the big target. $BONK bulls need to break the descending trendline Source: TradingView $BONK (BONK/USDT) has suffered worse than most among the major memecoins. A 60% reversal from the all-time high at $0.000062 occurred and it is now up to those bulls to buy the price up so that it can break out of the descending trendline. This is quite likely to happen, given that the correction has already been quite steep. If so, the targets are in the chart above. On the other hand, if the breakdown continues, the ascending bull market trendline would potentially be the last line of support. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

38052478,https://cryptonews.com/?p=322012,1735043111,Pudgy Penguins Investors Panic as PENGU Price Crashes ‚Äì What‚Äôs Next?,"The widely awaited airdrop of the official token of the Pudgy Penguins collection of NFTs has not gone well as the value of the token has collapsed less than 5 days after the event. According to data from decentralized exchanges (DEXs), the price of $PENGU dropped by 57% just 24 hours after the airdrop was completed. This decline came after a short-lived spike that propelled the price to $0.068. However, just hours later, the token is trading at $0.028 while the project‚Äôs market capitalization fell from $4.3 billion to just $1.7 billion as per the latest data from CoinGecko. In a similar way, the floor price of the project‚Äôs non-fungible tokens (NFTs) has experienced a significant decline during the same period, moving from a 30-day peak of 34.8 ETH ahead of the airdrop to just 18.2 ETH as of today. Airdrop farmers and speculators are apparently behind the significant volatility that $PENGU has experienced recently. Data from the crypto analytics firm Lookonchain cited one trader who made $8.4 million in profits in just 20 minutes by trading $PENGU. A trader made an incredible 36,984 $SOL ($8.36M) profit by trading $PENGU in less than 20 minutes. As soon as $PENGU launched, the trader spent 23,742 $SOL ($5.36M) to buy 239.6M $PENGU and later sold it for 60,726 $SOL ($13.72M). A massive profit! https://t.co/hIpkzxZjES pic.twitter.com/z5ZDKL3cfn ‚Äî Lookonchain (@lookonchain) December 17, 2024 This wallet bought around $5.4 million worth of $PENGU tokens right after they became available and quickly sold when the price spiked. This behavior is consistent with the trading volumes that the $PENGU token saw hours after the airdrop, with early estimates indicating that around $425 million were traded within the first four hours. $PENGU‚Äôs Price Settles Above $0.23 Upon Securing Top CEX Listings The project‚Äôs developing team rapidly announced on X that they had secured the listing of $PENGU on major exchanges including OKX, Binance , and Crypto.com. This increased the token liquidity but also opened the flush gates to massive liquidity and the possibility of sehalling large batches of tokens to a larger number of investors. Despite this significant volatility, the project‚Äôs official X page posted that $PENGU surpassed 500,000 holders just 19 hours ago. This is consistent with the stability that the price has experienced in the past three days or so as it has settled at around $0.025 and $0.027 per token. For now, the lowest that $PENGU has gone is $0.023 per token. This is more than two-thirds lower than the token‚Äôs peak price on Binance of $0.07 but it appears that this was a price at which buyers were willing to step in again after the initial hype. The current price action seems to indicate that a falling wedge is forming as lower highs are encountering higher lows according to the chart. The breakout price at this point would be the $0.03 mark. If the price surges above that level, the market could retest the levels seen in December 21 and this could mean that $PENGU could be poised to recover some of the territory it lost after the airdrop. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is already indicating that the token‚Äôs price is experiencing some positive momentum as it crossed the 50 mark and is on a clear uptrend. However, the demand for the project‚Äôs NFTs and how its floor prices have succumbed following the event are indications that farmers were quite active and distorted the price of these assets since December 5 when the airdrop was announced. Meanwhile, if late buyers do show up after this post-airdrop spike, the price could move to the $0.04 area, which was also a contended spot for traders the day after the airdrop was completed. You Have 24 Hours to Invest in This Successful Presale Token The $PENGU airdrop may have not gone as expected but one token could capture investors‚Äô interest in the near term based on the significant capital the project has managed to raise in a relatively short period. We are talking about Solaxy and its native token $SOLX, whose presale has attracted more than $4.52 million from investors. The project consists of a layer-two network for the Solana blockchain that offers zero congestion, errors, or delays. As interest in meme coins and other segments of the Solana ecosystem continues to grow, the mainnet has experienced significant congestion from time to time. This is where Solaxy comes to the rescue as it bundles transactions securely and processes them offline. The $SOLX presale ends in just 24 hours and the amount it has raised those far is interpreted as an early indication that investors will be eager to get their hands on this token once it hits decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Moreover, the success of the project to raise capital in this early stage could also put it on the radar of major centralized exchanges (CEXs). To buy $SOLX, just visit the Solaxy website and connect your wallet. You can convert ETH, USDT, or BNB tokens or pay with a bank card if you don‚Äôt own any of these cryptos at the moment. Moreover, if you don‚Äôt have a crypto wallet, you can try out Best Wallet ‚Äì an innovative Web 3 storage solution that offers multiple advanced features and that has been touted by some analysts as the MetaMask killer.

38048519,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=632653,1735043024,El Salvador showcases Bitcoin success in financial innovation discussions with China,"El Salvador‚Äôs Vice President Felix Ulloa flaunted the country‚Äôs Bitcoin reserves as evidence that the country is a model for financial freedom and a digital economy. Ulloa made this statement in a recent discussion with Chinese Ambassador Zhang Yanhui. According to a post on X, Ulloa mentioned the country‚Äôs Bitcoin reserves, which currently hold over $500 million worth of Bitcoin, during a meeting with Yanhui. The meeting focused on strengthening the ties between the two countries and strategies that have made El Salvador a model for economic development and innovation. Ulloa attributed the success of the Bitcoin policy to The National Bitcoin Office of El Salvador and the country‚Äôs president, Nayib Bukele, noting that the innovative approach has proven transformative for the country. He said: ‚ÄúThe President does not stay in his comfort zone. He has shown that, even if everyone says it cannot be done, it is always possible to transform the country for the benefit of its people.‚Äù Meanwhile, the discussions on the El Salvador ‚Äì China relationship also focused on other issues, including air and digital connectivity. According to the vice president, the country is building its digital infrastructure to become the region‚Äôs leader in connectivity and technology. El Salvador plans to double down on its Bitcoin policy El Salvador‚Äôs pride in its Bitcoin policy is unsurprising, given how the investment has yielded sizable profits for the country. When it first embraced Bitcoin in 2021, the idea of a sovereign nation buying Bitcoin for its reserves was entirely out of the box, and many raised concerns about how this could further damage its economy. However, the country‚Äôs decision to ignore naysayers has proven wise, with Bitcoin rising significantly this year and reaching $100,000 for the first time. Although the asset has now dropped to $94,000, the country remains in the green on its Bitcoin acquisition. It has decided to double down on its Bitcoin acquisition strategy, with Bukele reportedly having an interim target of adding 20,000 BTC to its current stash. Signs of increased acquisition are already evident as Arkaham Intelligence data shows that El Salvador has bought 11 Bitcoins at once twice in the past week. This is more than its usual purchase of 1 BTC daily. Interestingly, the success of its Bitcoin strategy and other economic and social policies has also improved its fiscal situation, allowing the country to access International Monetary Fund (IMF) financing. El Salvador recently reached a deal for a $3.5 billion loan from the IMF and other international organizations. Countries FOMO into Bitcoin as calls for US adoption grow The relative success of El Salvador‚Äôs Bitcoin policy and the rise in value have led to speculation that more sovereign states will adopt Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Leading the pack is the US, where many stakeholders are already debating the possibility. According to VanEck analysts, the US is creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve based on the BITCOIN Act proposed by Senator Cynthia Lummis . This reserve could hold 36% of the US debt in 2050, strengthening the US dollar. However, there are concerns about whether Congress will okay a law making Bitcoin a reserve asset. In response, experts at the Bitcoin Policy Institute believe there might be no need for a change in the law for the US to purchase Bitcoin. They claim that the US Treasury, through the Secretary of the Treasury, could use the Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF) to buy Bitcoin with the President‚Äôs approval. While debates continue to rage in the US over whether the government can buy or make Bitcoin a reserve asset, the Kingdom of Bhutan in South Asia has acquired most of its Bitcoin through mining and currently holds over 12,000 BTC. Others, such as the US, China, the United Kingdom, and Ukraine, also hold BTC, which they acquired through seizures and donations. Nevertheless, no major country has adopted Bitcoin as a reserve asset. However, reports have emerged that several countries, including Russia and Middle Eastern countries, are also considering it.

38048335,https://coinpedia.org/?p=397219,1735042968,Bank of Italy Exposes Bitcoin P2P Platforms as Tools for Crime,"The post Bank of Italy Exposes Bitcoin P2P Platforms as Tools for Crime appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Bank of Italy in its Economic and Financial 893rd research paper published in November 2024 has raised concerns about certain Bitcoin peer-to-peer (P2P) services , calling them ‚Äúcrime-as-a-service.‚Äù However, these unregulated services are now seen as key tools for money laundering, especially in countries with weak laws. Bitcoin P2P as ‚ÄúCrime-as-a-Service‚Äù In its latest report, titled ‚ÄúMoney Laundering and Blockchain: Can You Track the Footprints in the Crypto World?‚Äù, the Bank highlights platforms like kycnot.me, which let users trade Bitcoin without knowing their customer identity verification (KYC), making it easier for criminals to hide illegal money. The further report explains that these platforms let people trade Bitcoin without revealing their identity, making it difficult for law enforcement to track where the funds come from. Money launderers often take advantage of platforms in countries with weak anti-money laundering (AML) laws or those labeled as high-risk by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). Interestingly, the Bank report also mentions events like ‚ÄúSatoshi Spritz,‚Äù where individuals gather to exchange Bitcoin for goods or fiat currency. While these events are often organized by the Bitcoin community to educate others, the Bank warns that they could also be used for money laundering. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Top 7 Crypto Market Predictions for 2025 , How Money Launderers Operate Even though blockchain technology keeps a public record of all transactions, it doesn‚Äôt show the identity of the person behind each address. Criminals use this to their advantage, finding ways to hide the origin of their money. The Bank‚Äôs report explains some common tricks used by money launderers. Mixers and Tumblers: These tools mix different users‚Äô funds, making it hard to trace where the money came from. Chain-Hopping: This involves moving funds across different blockchains to confuse trackers. Anonymous Wallets: These wallets hide users‚Äô IP addresses and break the link between transactions. Call for Strict Regulations The Bank of Italy says that stronger rules are needed to fight these problems. By enforcing strict KYC and anti-money laundering (AML) measures, authorities can make it harder for criminals to misuse Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Join the Feline Frenzy! $CATZILLA Is on the Rise‚ÄîClaim Your Share Today! Ethena (ENA): A Crypto-Native Synthetic Dollar and Internet Bond Ethena (ENA) is a synthetic dollar protocol built on Ethereum. It offers a crypto-native form of money that does not rely on traditional banks. Ethena provides the 'Internet Bond', a dollar-denominated savings instrument accessible worldwide. This technology aims to create a more inclusive financial system by removing traditional barriers. The synthetic dollar and Internet Bond may attract users seeking stability and returns in the crypto space. The potential of ENA depends on various factors, including market trends and interest in synthetic assets. Its appeal in the current market cycle is influenced by these conditions. Worldcoin (WLD): Eye Scans and AI for Global Digital Identity Worldcoin (WLD) is a cryptocurrency that uses eye scans and AI to create unique digital identities for users worldwide. By leveraging the Orb device for iris-based verification, it aims to provide universal access to the digital economy and fair wealth distribution. Since its launch in 2023, it has attracted over 2 million users and plans to value the token at $3 billion. Co-founded by Sam Altman, the project proposes a fixed supply of 10 billion WLD tokens. With the integration of OpenAI's tools, Worldcoin is positioned at the intersection of biometrics, AI, and finance. In the current market cycle, its innovative approach and growing user base may make it an attractive option for some investors. Ondo Finance: Tokenizing Real-World Assets with Blockchain Efficiency Ondo Finance combines the reliability of traditional finance with the efficiency of blockchain by tokenizing stable, income-generating real-world assets. This approach aims to make high-quality financial products more accessible using blockchain technology. Ondo has two main parts: an asset management arm that creates tokenized financial products, and a technology arm that develops decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. By working with reputable partners like BlackRock and using Coinbase for asset custody, Ondo emphasizes trust and security. Their product USDY is secured by US Treasuries and bank deposits, offering stability and transparency. In the current market cycle, Ondo's focus on regulated and transparent asset tokenization presents a promising development in the cryptocurrency space. Polkadot (DOT): A Protocol for Interoperable and Scalable Blockchains Polkadot is a decentralized protocol and cryptocurrency that enables communication between different blockchains. It allows value and data to be transferred across networks like Ethereum and Bitcoin without intermediaries. Using parachains, Polkadot enhances speed and scalability, processing more transactions per second than Bitcoin and Ethereum. The native token, DOT, is used for governance and staking, allowing holders to participate in network development and transaction validation. Created by Gavin Wood and launched in May 2020, Polkadot aims to create an interconnected blockchain ecosystem. In the current market cycle, its emphasis on interoperability and scalability positions it as a significant player in the blockchain space. Conclusion As the 2024 bull run continues, ENA, WLD, ONDO, and DOT have less short-term potential. Catzilla, however, stands out as the ultimate meme coin hero aiming for financial freedom for all.

Solana Poised for Rally: Targets $249 Resistance Amid Bullish Signals Solana is showing signs of strength despite recent declines. Currently trading between $160.72 and $214.48, the coin is hovering around its 10-day and 100-day moving averages at about $187. The RSI stands at 56, suggesting room for upward movement. The MACD is positive, indicating bullish momentum. With the nearest resistance at $249, a significant rally could push Solana up by over 30% from current levels. The stochastic oscillator is also supportive of more gains. In the context of an approaching altcoin season and global crypto bull run, Solana has the potential to break resistance levels and aim for $302, which would represent substantial growth. Short-term dips may present buying opportunities before a major uptrend. Ethereum's price is ranging between $2884 and $3891, showing signs of consolidation after a recent 14.88% dip over the past week. With the Relative Strength Index at 55.53, it's neither overbought nor oversold, hinting at potential upward movement. The nearest resistance levels are at $4502 and $5509. Breaking through these could see Ethereum rally towards new highs, representing a potential increase of over 40% from current levels. The Stochastic indicator at 80 suggests building momentum. With the 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages closely aligned around $3365, Ethereum may be gearing up for a bullish run. Crypto enthusiasts are watching closely for a breakout as the altcoin season approaches. Ethena's Surge Continues: Potential 94% Upside Ahead Ethena (ENA) is showing strong signs of potential growth. Despite a slight dip of over 9% in the past week, the coin has surged by more than 60% in the last month and gained over 90% in six months. With both the 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages at $1.05, ENA is consolidating before a possible breakout. The RSI at around 55 indicates room for upward movement. If ENA surpasses the nearest resistance level at $1.55, it could climb towards $2.04, representing an increase of up to 94% from current prices. The positive MACD suggests bullish momentum is building, hinting at a promising future for this altcoin. Stellar (XLM) Poised for Breakout as Altcoin Season Nears Stellar's price has surged over 300% in the past 6 months, showing strong momentum. Despite a recent dip of 12% this week and 29% this month, it remains in the $0.29 to $0.45 range. The coin is hovering around its 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages at $0.36. Indicators like the Relative Strength Index at 57.99 and MACD level at 0.0027 suggest a potential upward move. If Stellar breaks past the nearest resistance level at $0.54, it could target the next resistance at $0.70, offering gains of over 50% from current levels. With altcoin season approaching, Stellar might be ready for a significant rise. Conclusion With the bull run of 2024 here, SOL, ETH, ENA, and XLM may have less short-term potential. Catzilla stands out as the ultimate meme coin hero, aiming for financial freedom for all. Offering 700% ROI potential in its presale and triple utility features, Catzilla invites participation in the battle against crypto villains.

38047968,https://crypto.news/?p=14321896,1735042329,ETH ETF breakthrough; SOL prepares for massive surge as Lunex gains traction,"Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. ETH nears $5,000, Solana rallies on bullish trends, and Lunex Network gains traction with its smart LNEX token and DeFi ecosystem. Table of Contents Lunex Network gains popularity with a native token and ecosystem benefits Ethereum faces potential $5k price following ETF surge Solana may see even bigger gains Conclusion The crypto market is heating up as ETH inches closer to a potential $5,000 milestone. Meanwhile, Solana gears up for a huge rally which is fueled by strong technical indicators and growing confidence among traders. The emerging Lunex Network is also adding to the excitement as it is quickly gaining traction across the entire crypto market. But what exactly makes Lunex Network worth investing in? Let‚Äôs find out. Lunex Network gains popularity with a native token and ecosystem benefits There has been an increasingly bullish gain projection for Lunex Network since it made its way to the crypto scene. This new crypto is projected to go on a parabolic rally, particularly due to its fast-growing ecosystem and huge presale. The major factor responsible for this fast-growing ecosystem is Lunex Network‚Äôs special governance token, called LNEX. With LNEX tokens, investors can enjoy the unique revenue-sharing model on Lunex Network‚Äôs ecosystem. Through this model, holders get the chance to earn passive income when they stake their LNEX tokens. Staking these tokens will enable these holders to earn up to 18% APY. But there‚Äôs more, Lunex Network also uses deflationary tokenomics, which positions LNEX for long-term success in the market. Lunex Network also brings cutting-edge technology to the DeFi space. It appeals to crypto traders who value anonymity, efficiency, security, and high profits. As Lunex Network continues to gain traction, it won‚Äôt be long before its value starts to rival those of market giants in the crypto industry. Ethereum faces potential $5k price following ETF surge Since its launch in July, the BlackRock iShares ETH ETF has attracted $2.6 billion in total inflows . On December 5, it recorded its highest-ever daily inflows, totaling $292 million. As a result, the ETH ETF net inflows went up to over $428 million. The growth of ETH ETF has positively influenced Ethereum , as its price is now hovering around $3,900. From the look of things, ETH could be aiming for a possible breakout to reach all-time highs of $5,000 or more. Investors are hopeful that ETH will take advantage of the current green state of the market to reach the $5k mark as soon as possible. Solana may see even bigger gains Over the past month, the official SOL price has risen by 19.84% from $198 to over $238. Since SOL saw green charts throughout November, many crypto analysts and market chart experts are very optimistic about its growth in December. One analyst in particular, Jelle, made a post on X, where he predicted that SOL will soon reach a new all-time high since its technical analysis charts are showing a bullish trend. SOL is trading above its 30-day EMA ($223) and 50-day EMA ($208). Its bull-bear power is at 2.58, which is in the buy zone and is a huge sign that bulls may continue pushing the official SOL price higher. Conclusion The ongoing market bull run has everyone, especially ETH and SOL investors, excited as they are seeing the market‚Äôs positive influence on their investments. Lunex Network investors are also not left out, as its presale is driving their profits to new levels. For those considering entry, LNEX tokens are still accessible at $0.0038.

42389858,83c8c023-3c43-452c-90b7-e1e9ca0e273f,1735042219,North Korea Blamed for May's $305M Hack on Japanese Crypto Exchange DMM,"The $308 million hack of Japanese crypto exchange DMM in May was the work of North Korean hackers, the U.S. and Japanese law enforcement agencies said Monday.  The theft of 4,502.9 bitcoin (BTC), which is forcing the exchange to close, was ""affiliated"" with a group known as TraderTraitor, the FBI said in a statement with the Department of Defense Cyber Crime Center and National Police Agency of Japan.  Hackers linked to North Korea dominated crypto crime this year, Chainalysis said in its annual report on the subject. The country, whose official name is the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), is tied to more than half of the crypto value stolen in 2024. Its operatives are responsible for the theft of $1.34 billion across 47 incidents, more than double the $660 million (a figure revised down from an initial estimate) taken last year.  TraderTraitor, also known as Jade Sleet, UNC4899 and Slow Pisces, generally works by targeted social engineering, according to the statement. In this case, malicious code was inserted into a Python script used in a fictitious pre-employment test and sent by an operative posing as a recruiter on LinkedIn to a candidate who worked at an outside enterprise, crypto wallet company Ginco.   The victim copied the code to their personal Github page, giving TraderTraitor access to session cookie information that allowed it access to Ginco's communications system. Months later, it probably used the access to intercept a legitimate transaction request by a DMM employee, leading to the theft, the agencies said.",NEGATIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Sheldon Reback,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/12/24/north-korea-blamed-for-may-s-usd305m-hack-on-japanese-crypto-exchange-dmm,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ae3d310326c0f8a1991358d50350b2eaff5fae4e-1724x900.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

JasmyCoin (JASMY) In today's connected world, devices like phones, cars, and computers constantly collect our personal data. JasmyCoin is a project that aims to put control of this data back into our hands. Based in Tokyo, Jasmy Corporation combines Internet of Things (IoT) technology with blockchain to create a secure platform. This platform lets users manage and share their data safely. By using JasmyCoin, people can decide who gets access to their information and even turn it into a personal asset. As concerns about data privacy grow, JasmyCoin offers a solution that could reshape how we interact with our devices. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, Jasmy focuses on data ownership and security, which sets it apart in the market. With its secure environment and easy-to-use interface, it has the potential to attract many users. In the current market cycle, where decentralization and data privacy are hot topics, JasmyCoin looks promising. It might be an attractive option for those interested in both cryptocurrency and personal data control. Kaspa (KAS) Kaspa is shaking things up in the world of digital money. It uses a special method called GHOSTDAG, which is different from how most cryptocurrencies work. Instead of ignoring extra blocks of data, Kaspa lets them exist together. This means it can process transactions much faster. Right now, Kaspa creates one new block every second. It hopes to speed this up to ten blocks per second soon, and maybe even reach 100 per second one day. With features that make the network easy to use and plans for upgrades, Kaspa aims to make digital transactions quicker and more efficient. In today's fast-paced market, speed is key. Kaspa's approach could make it stand out among other digital coins. While some popular cryptocurrencies struggle with slow transaction times, Kaspa's technology offers a fresh solution. Its potential for quick processing might attract users who want faster and smoother transactions. Compared to other coins, Kaspa could be an exciting new player to watch. As the crypto market continues to evolve, Kaspa's innovations might give it an edge in the current cycle. TRON (TRX) TRON is a blockchain-based platform that aims to reshape the internet as we know it. Launched in 2017 by the Tron Foundation, it gives digital content creators full ownership of their work. By cutting out middlemen like YouTube and Facebook, TRON allows creators to earn more from their content. The platform supports smart contracts and decentralized applications, known as dApps. This means developers can build a variety of applications on TRON's network. Transactions are transparent and can be tracked on a public ledger, ensuring openness and trust. In today's market, TRON stands out with its focus on decentralizing the web. For investors, TRX could be an attractive option, especially with the growing interest in dApps and blockchain technology. Compared to other coins, TRON offers lower transaction fees and faster processing times. This could make it appealing to both developers and users. As the demand for platforms that empower content creators grows, TRON's potential seems promising. It serves as an alternative to Ethereum, offering similar capabilities but with its own unique advantages. Keeping an eye on TRON might be worthwhile for those interested in the evolving landscape of digital assets. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) started as a joke, much like Dogecoin. But it's quickly becoming more than just a meme. Launched in August 2020 by someone known only as Ryoshi, SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain. This means it can work with many apps and systems already using Ethereum. What's interesting is that Ryoshi sent half of all SHIB tokens to Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum. This move built trust. Buterin then donated a big chunk to help with COVID-19 relief in India and ""burned"" 40% of the tokens, reducing supply and raising SHIB's profile. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB's connection with Ethereum allows for more possibilities. There's ShibaSwap, a place to trade tokens without a central authority. Plans are also in the works for a platform for NFTs (digital art) and a system where SHIB holders can have a say in decisions. This could make SHIB more useful. In the current market, while many coins are struggling, SHIB's developments could make it stand out. Its potential for real-world use, not just as a joke, might attract more attention. As the crypto world evolves, SHIB could be a coin to watch. Conclusion JASMY, KAS, TRX, and SHIB are promising affordable cryptos, but new memecoins uniting sports fans may offer even greater growth potential.

Another Delay Instead of More Clarity Pi Network ‚Äì the controversial cryptocurrency project that claims to enable people to mine digital assets directly from their smartphones ‚Äì saw the light of day more than five years ago. Since then, it has undergone numerous developments, but its mainnet and native token have yet to go live. This has caused frustration across the multi-million Pi Network community, with many members insisting on information regarding those milestones. Earlier this year, the project‚Äôs team said the first big target is the launch of the Open Network, which should be introduced once users pass necessary Know-Your-Customer (KYC) verifications and migrate to the mainnet (known as the Grace Period). Initially, people had until late September to do so, but later, the period was extended to November 30. It was then moved to New Year‚Äôs Eve, with the team claiming this will provide users with ‚Äúthe ample opportunity to secure their Pi.‚Äù Most recently, the developers behind the project announced another extension. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre extending both KYC and Mainnet Migration Grace Period deadlines to January 31, 2025, to help include more Pioneers and their Pi as we prepare for Open Network in Q1 2025,‚Äù the post on X reads. Somewhat expectedly , many community members were rather annoyed by the latest delay. Some noted that the project has been extending the deadline almost every month, jokingly advising the team to run the Grace Period for a few more years. ‚ÄúExtend it until 2028 instead of month by month. Nobody believes this will actually launch anytime soon. Maybe when the bull run is over,‚Äù one X user stated . Earlier in December, Pi Network maintained that 18 million people have completed Know-Your-Customer (KYC) verifications, while 8 million have already migrated to the mainnet. The developers also said they could launch the Open Network as early as Q1 2025.

38048017,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=632667,1735042111,NY Fed survey reveals workers are demanding higher salaries as AI threatens job security,"A Federal Reserve Bank of New York survey shows that more workers are uneasy about losing their jobs. Their fears are tied to companies threatening to replace their positions with AI. Nonetheless, these anxieties haven‚Äôt caused job seekers to lower their salary demands. The New York Fed asks up to 1,000 people about their employment outlook every quarter. The latest results showed that 4.4% of workers think they might be out of a job within several months. This has hit a record high, particularly the highest number since March 2020, at the outset of the pandemic. However, these job security fears are not enough to deter job seekers from lowering their salary demands. Workers won‚Äôt accept a new role for less than an average of $81,147, a jump of nearly $20,000 since March 2020. This is the so-called reservation wage, the minimal wage some would accept for a new job. AI and economic uncertainty add to workers‚Äô stress Workers‚Äô concerns are not unfounded. It‚Äôs no news that advancements in AI and other economic challenges are threatening people‚Äôs livelihoods. Analysts have described it as the ‚Äúperfect storm‚Äù for mass unemployment, as per Korn Ferry‚Äôs recent report . Klarna‚Äôs CEO, Sebastian Siemiatkowski has also said he hopes AI will replace 1,800 employees one day, and that‚Äôs not too far off. On the other hand, Tech giant Cisco also laid off thousands of employees this year as part of a drive to invest more in AI. Still, most of the workers feel stuck in their jobs. On wages and career opportunities, Fed data shows widespread discontent among women, people without college degrees, and households making less than $60,000 a year. Moreover, some are even demanding higher pay from new employers while they can because there are fewer chances of promotion. More workers are seeking new jobs than during the Great Resignation The job market has become concentrated with challenges now as more people are actively looking for new jobs. The Fed‚Äôs survey shows that 30% of respondents said they were searching for jobs, compared with 19% last summer. That‚Äôs the highest number of job seekers since March 2, 2014, when 32% of professionals were looking for an exit. During the pandemic in March 2021, 4 million US citizens quit their jobs, while 20% of the people in the Fed‚Äôs survey were looking for new workplaces. Workers are currently changing jobs at a record 7.1% rate. As compared to the Great Resignation, only less than 5% of workers switched to new companies.

Tokens like Shiba Inu, PEPE, and XYZVerse are skyrocketing in popularity. They're setting new records in the cryptocurrency market. This sudden rise is capturing global attention. What is fueling their meteoric ascent? Dive into the intriguing factors behind the success of these standout memecoins. Trump's Victory Sparks Crypto Chaos: $XYZ Meme Coin Ready to Deliver a 99,900% Knockout Donald Trump‚Äôs election victory has triggered a seismic shift in the crypto market, setting the stage for a bull run like no other. As the dust settles, major coins limp forward with uninspiring double-digit gains, while meme coins are stealing the show. PNUT‚Äôs recent 4,500% surge? FRED‚Äôs 6,000% explosion? Ancient history, buried in the ashes of short-lived hype. These coins buckled under selling pressure, leaving FOMO-ridden investors licking their wounds. But the crypto battlefield doesn‚Äôt wait for the weak ‚Äî a new titan has emerged with plans to obliterate profit records and deliver an earth-shaking 99,900% surge. Take the XYZ Side - The Undisputed Champion of Meme Coins $XYZ Breaks into the Ring to Knockout Meme Coin Legends Meet $XYZ - the first-ever all-sports memecoins for true crypto degens hungry for 1000X profits.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) started as a joke, much like Dogecoin. But it's quickly becoming more than just a meme. Launched in August 2020 by someone known only as Ryoshi, SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain. This means it can work with many apps and systems already using Ethereum. What's interesting is that Ryoshi sent half of all SHIB tokens to Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum. This move built trust. Buterin then donated a big chunk to help with COVID-19 relief in India and ""burned"" 40% of the tokens, reducing supply and raising SHIB's profile. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB's connection with Ethereum allows for more possibilities. There's ShibaSwap, a place to trade tokens without a central authority. Plans are also in the works for a platform for NFTs (digital art) and a system where SHIB holders can have a say in decisions. This could make SHIB more useful. In the current market, while many coins are struggling, SHIB's developments could make it stand out. Its potential for real-world use, not just as a joke, might attract more attention. As the crypto world evolves, SHIB could be a coin to watch. Pepe (PEPE) PEPE is a new player in the cryptocurrency world, inspired by the famous Pepe the Frog meme created by Matt Furie. Launched on Ethereum as a deflationary memecoin, it aims to join the ranks of popular meme-based cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. PEPE appeals to crypto enthusiasts with its no-tax policy and straightforward approach‚Äîembracing its meme roots without pretense of utility. In late April to May 2023, PEPE saw an explosive surge, with its market cap reaching a peak of $1.6 billion. Early investors became millionaires overnight, and a strong community rallied behind the coin. This phenomenon sparked what some call a ""memecoin season,"" with other meme tokens experiencing wild rides. PEPE's roadmap is ambitious, aiming for more exchange listings and a ""meme takeover."" While it lacks traditional utility, its viral nature and community support make it an interesting prospect. As the crypto market looks ahead to the next Bitcoin halving and a potential bull run, PEPE stands out as a coin that could ride the wave of meme-powered popularity. Conclusion While SHIB and PEPE have surged, XYZVerse aims to outperform them with 20,000% growth, uniting sports fans in the first all-sport memecoin during the 2024 bull run.

Cardano (ADA) Cardano (ADA) has experienced notable price swings recently. In the past week, its price fell by 20.80%. Over the last month, it decreased by 14.34%. However, looking back six months, ADA's price has surged by 122.45%. This long-term growth suggests strong underlying momentum despite short-term declines. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for ADA is at 42.36, indicating that it is nearing oversold territory. The Stochastic oscillator stands at 13.57, which also points toward potential bullish reversal. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) level is -0.0055, showing bearish momentum but hinting at a possible upcoming shift. With the 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages closely aligned at $0.89 and $0.90 respectively, ADA's price is consolidating. If ADA's price can overcome the nearest resistance level at $1.28, it could target the second resistance at $1.64. Achieving these levels would represent gains of approximately 48% and 78% from the current price range of $0.72-$1.08. Conversely, if the price dips to the nearest support level at $0.56, it would mark a decrease of about 22%. Traders are watching these levels carefully, as they may signal key opportunities in ADA's price movement. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin has seen significant shifts in its price recently. Over the past week, it dropped by 24.51%, and the past month shows a decrease of 25.80%. Despite these declines, DOGE holds a substantial 141.95% increase over the last six months. Currently, it trades between $0.24 and $0.40, reflecting a volatile market stance. Technical indicators present a mixed outlook. The Simple Moving Averages for both 10 and 100 days stand at $0.31, indicating a period of consolidation. The Relative Strength Index is at 41.81, suggesting that the coin is nearing oversold territory. A Stochastic value of 17.76 supports this, pointing to potential upward momentum. However, the MACD level is at -0.002010, which could hint at continued bearish trends. Key price levels are in focus for Dogecoin. The nearest resistance is at $0.48. Approaching this point would mark an increase of around 60% from the lower end of its current range. Beyond that, the second resistance level is at $0.63. On the downside, the nearest support level sits at $0.17. Falling below this could lead to the second support at $0.0252, indicating a significant decrease. These levels are crucial as traders watch for DOGE's next move. Conclusion Though ADA and DOGE are strong, XYZVerse (XYZ) leads as the first all-sport memecoin, aiming for 20,000% growth and uniting sports fans in a community-driven ecosystem.

Moreover, it presents a good entry at the current market price, positioning it among the best coins to invest in. Also boosting confidence are bullish forecasts from top experts. Core_crypto1, a top analyst, predicts Ethereum (ETH) is gearing up for a breakout, primed for a 10 to 15% upside in the short term. Tanxcrypto, another leading expert, expects a bounce from its 200-EMA and a jump toward $4,200 and $5,000 if it flips the $3,800 resistance. Dogecoin (DOGE): Price Tumbled Dogecoin (DOGE), one of the top crypto coins, struggles with momentum. After tumbling below the $0.4 support and hovering around $0.31, investor confidence took a big hit, with many opting for new altcoins like DTX with massive growth prospects. Notwithstanding, top crypto experts eye a comeback. AnastaMaverick, a leading crypto trader and analyst, highlights consolidation within a descending triangle, predicting a surge above $0.32 upon a breakout. Another expert, Best_analysts, hints at a jump toward $0.4 and $0.6, with potential support at $0.22. At the current Dogecoin price, it is one of the best coins to invest in. It has seemingly bottomed and is poised for a bounce, as evident in key indicators like the Commodity Channel Index (20) and the 9-HMA. Despite this, DTX‚Äôs 100x upside potential makes it a more compelling alternative to DOGE. DTX Exchange (DTX): New Crypto Alternative to Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ethereum (ETH) DTX Exchange (DTX) is quickly becoming an investor favorite given its massive growth prospects and novelty. As a blend of traditional and decentralized finance, it aims to reshape the global trading scene, contributing to the presale surpassing the $10.5 million fundraising goal. Boasting higher upside potential than Ethereum (ETH) and Dogecoin (DOGE), DTX is a top crypto to invest in.

Sui (SUI) Sui is a new kind of blockchain that's designed for the future. It's built to handle global adoption by being secure, powerful, and able to scale as needed. At its core, Sui uses a unique way of managing data that focuses on objects. This makes it more efficient than many existing blockchains. It also uses the Move programming language, which adds an extra layer of security and addresses common problems found in other blockchain systems. What makes Sui stand out is its focus on the user experience. Many people find blockchain technology hard to use, but Sui aims to change that. It introduces innovations like zkLogin, which makes logging in easier, sponsored transactions that reduce costs for users, and programmable transaction blocks that make apps more flexible. These features make blockchain applications more accessible and user-friendly. In today's market, where usability and scalability are crucial, Sui appears to be an attractive option. Compared to other coins that may struggle with speed or high fees, Sui offers solutions that could make it a strong contender in the crypto space. Dogwifhat (WIF) Dogwifhat (WIF) is the latest sensation in the crypto world, bringing a fun twist to digital currencies. Inspired by the viral Dogwifhat meme, this dog-themed coin is gaining popularity on the Solana blockchain. Meme coins like WIF are known for their community spirit and ability to spread like wildfire across the internet. They often draw from popular memes or cultural trends, making them relatable and exciting for many crypto enthusiasts. In the current market cycle, WIF stands out with its playful approach and growing community. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, WIF focuses on creating a sense of fun and belonging among its holders. While its value can be more unpredictable due to its nature and large supply, many are drawn to its potential for rapid growth and the lively community behind it. Compared to other meme coins, WIF offers a fresh experience on the Solana blockchain, which is known for its fast transactions and low fees. With the rising interest in meme coins, WIF could be an attractive option for those looking to explore new trends in the crypto space. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) started as a joke, much like Dogecoin. But it's quickly becoming more than just a meme. Launched in August 2020 by someone known only as Ryoshi, SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain. This means it can work with many apps and systems already using Ethereum. What's interesting is that Ryoshi sent half of all SHIB tokens to Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum. This move built trust. Buterin then donated a big chunk to help with COVID-19 relief in India and ""burned"" 40% of the tokens, reducing supply and raising SHIB's profile. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB's connection with Ethereum allows for more possibilities. There's ShibaSwap, a place to trade tokens without a central authority. Plans are also in the works for a platform for NFTs (digital art) and a system where SHIB holders can have a say in decisions. This could make SHIB more useful. In the current market, while many coins are struggling, SHIB's developments could make it stand out. Its potential for real-world use, not just as a joke, might attract more attention. As the crypto world evolves, SHIB could be a coin to watch. Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) There's a new squirrel in town, and it's turning heads in the crypto world. Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) is a meme-inspired token on the Solana blockchain. Designed for meme lovers and crypto enthusiasts, PNUT brings fun and community spirit to the table. With a total supply of 100 million tokens, it features zero transaction taxes, a revoked contract, and a burnt liquidity pool. This means holders can feel secure about their assets. The token's mascot, Pnut, is a playful, Pepe-like squirrel that embodies the project's lighthearted vibe. To get your hands on PNUT, you can use platforms like Jupiter Aggregator. In a market where meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have made headlines, PNUT aims to carve out its own niche. Its foundation on Solana offers fast transactions and low fees, which is a big plus. The zero transaction tax and security features make it stand out from many other tokens. With the crypto market always looking for the next big thing, PNUT could be an attractive option for those seeking something new and fun. Its community-driven approach might just be the peanut butter to your crypto jelly. Conclusion While SUI, WIF, SHIB, and PNUT show promise, XYZVerse stands out by uniting sports fans and aiming for massive growth in the upcoming bull run.

Currently trading between $29.44 and $47.80, the coin is showing signs of consolidation. The Relative Strength Index at 41.32 and Stochastic at 33.72 suggest it's nearing oversold territory, hinting at a possible rebound. The nearest resistance level is at $59, and breaking through could lead to significant gains. With a 42.23% increase over the past six months, AVAX demonstrates strong long-term potential. As the altcoin season looms and the global crypto bull run gains momentum, AVAX might surge towards the second resistance level of $77.40. Cardano Set to Surge: ADA Ready for a Major Upswing Cardano (ADA) has seen a recent dip, with a 1-week decline of nearly 20%. However, over the past 6 months, it has soared by over 124%, showing strong growth potential. Currently trading between $0.72 and $1.08, it's slightly below its 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages. Technical indicators like RSI at 44.78 and Stochastic at 47.53 suggest it's poised for a rebound. If ADA breaks the nearest resistance at $1.28, it could rally towards the second resistance at $1.64, a potential gain of over 50%. With altcoin season approaching, Cardano may be gearing up for a significant upward move. Conclusion During this bull run, DOGEN emerges as a token embodying luxury and success for those seeking the best. With expected 700% growth by presale end and potential thousand-fold returns, it outshines AVAX and ADA in the short term.

Solana Poised for a Surge Amid Altcoin Season Prospects Solana (SOL) is currently trading between $160 and $214, showing consolidation after recent declines. Despite a one-month drop of about 28%, the six-month gain of over 34% indicates strong long-term potential. The Relative Strength Index is near 53, suggesting neutral momentum and room for upward movement. If SOL breaks above the nearest resistance at $249, it could rally toward the second resistance level at $302, marking a potential increase of roughly 50% from current levels. With altcoin season on the horizon and supportive indicators like a high stochastic value, Solana might be ready to climb. However, it‚Äôs crucial to watch the support level at $141 to confirm the bullish trend. Ethereum Set to Surge as Altcoin Season Nears Ethereum is trading between $2884 and $3891, showing consolidation. The nearest resistance is at $4502‚Äîbreaking this could lead to significant gains. The RSI is around 49, indicating neutral momentum with room to rise. Although the price dropped over 16% in the last week, the monthly and six-month changes are minimal, showing stability. The stochastic indicator is approaching overbought levels but still suggests potential for growth. With altcoin season on the horizon and a bullish market sentiment, Ethereum could aim for the second resistance at $5509, representing a substantial increase from current levels. AVAX Poised for Breakout: Eyeing Resistance Levels Amid Bullish Momentum Avalanche (AVAX) is showing signs of a potential surge. Despite a recent dip of 27.60% over the past week, the coin remains within the current price range of $29.44 to $47.80. The RSI at 46.06 suggests that AVAX is nearing oversold territory, indicating a possible upward movement. The MACD level at -0.27 hints at bullish momentum building. If AVAX can break through the nearest resistance at $59, it could target the next resistance at $77.40, representing a significant gain from current levels. With a 44.72% increase over the past six months, AVAX is well-positioned for growth in the upcoming altcoin season. Cardano (ADA) Poised for Breakout Amid Altcoin Season Hype Cardano is trading between $0.72 and $1.08. The 10-day simple moving average is $0.89, just below the 100-day average of $0.91, hinting at potential upward momentum. The RSI stands at 50.96, indicating neutral market conditions. With a stochastic value of 80.77, there‚Äôs a sign of strong interest. The MACD level is close to turning positive at -0.00305. If ADA breaks the nearest resistance at $1.28, it could rally toward the second resistance at $1.64, a potential increase of around 50%. Support at $0.56 provides a solid base. The indicators suggest that ADA might be gearing up for a significant move in the anticipated altcoin season. Conclusion While SOL, ETH, AVAX, and ADA may have limited short-term potential, DOGEN stands out. Designed for those seeking luxury and success, DOGEN expects 700% growth by presale end and potential thousand-fold returns.

Initially seen as a joke, it gained significant value in 2021, rising to the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. This growth was influenced by social media and figures like Elon Musk. The coin's open and abundant design reflects its roots in internet culture.

Solana whales jump to this $0.12 token to recover the lost capital. Table of Contents Solana update: $190 support could trigger a potential uptrend SOL price breakout and bullish MACD outlook DTX Exchange overshadows Solana in presale stage 6 New DeFi entrant dominates crypto giant, Solana lags Investors pump DTX‚Äôs ongoing presale rally to claim lucrative opportunities and bag profits after the widespread Solana crash. The recent bearish drive in the Solana network has scared away investors, pushing them to explore other projects to add to their portfolios. DTX Exchange has cashed the opportunity with mind-blowing gains in its presale, positioned for a 25x breakout soon. Solana update: $190 support could trigger a potential uptrend Solana , on a three-day timeframe, showed potential for a recovery from the $190 price range, marking it as a key support level. SOL saw an upswing after touching this point, indicated by the solid ascending support trendline. This rebound suggested the $190 zone‚Äôs potential as an optimal entry point for long positions in SOL. The pattern of recovery indicated strong buyer interest and support, reinforcing the trendline‚Äôs role in shaping SOL movements. This support could prove crucial for future price dynamics, particularly if Solana continues to rebound and challenge upper resistance levels. With each touch of the trendline followed by upward momentum, the trend signaled growing investor confidence. If this pattern persists, it could set a bullish precedent for Solana. It would position Solana crypto as a lead contender in the next market rally. The continuation of this trendline as a confirmation of Solana‚Äôs market strength provided a strategic advantage for entry or accumulation in anticipation of further price increases. SOL price breakout and bullish MACD outlook Additionally, Solana crypto‚Äôs four-hour chart recently displayed clear signs of upward momentum. A breakout from the descending trendline further added confluence to the pivotal shift, signaling a potential resumption of the uptrend. This was further substantiated by a bullish crossover in the MACD indicators, reinforcing the positive shift in market sentiment. These together justified the $190 level as an ideal entry zone, previously identified as a crucial support area. This breakout and the MACD crossover further affirmed an increased buying interest. Possibly also the start of a sustained upward movement. The convergence of the patterns suggested that Solana could continue its upward trajectory. A sustained movement above this breakout point could confirm the continuation of the trend. These signals were indications of potential market directions. Adjusting strategies accordingly was crucial to take advantage of the emerging opportunities in Solana‚Äôs price action. Furthermore, Solana‚Äôs developments further supported the potential recovery with Sendaifun recently unveiled the Solana Agent Kit. It is an innovative open-source tool designed to integrate AI agents with the Solana blockchain.

38047185,https://finbold.com/?p=222362,1735040767,Can DOGE reach $1 in 2025?,"Dogecoin ( DOGE ), the popular meme-inspired cryptocurrency , remains one of the most intriguing coins in the market as investors speculate on its ability to rally to $1 by 2025. While DOGE has delivered impressive gains over the past year, the road to $1 is paved with significant hurdles, largely due to its inflationary supply mechanics and high market cap requirements. Currently trading at $0.32, Dogecoin has seen a 21.26% decline in the last week and a 26.51% dip over the past month. However, it remains up by 238.47% year-over-year, showcasing its long-term resilience. Despite the recent decline, DOGE hit a yearly high of $0.46 on December 9, 2024, nearly halfway to the $1 mark. At the time, its market capitalization reached an impressive $68.7 billion, supported by a circulating supply of 147.33 billion DOGE. DOGE YTD price chart. Source: Finbold DOGE supply inflation One of Dogecoin‚Äôs defining characteristics is its fixed yearly issuance of 5 billion DOGE, which introduces a steady inflationary pressure on its price. While this inflation rate decreases over time relative to the growing supply, it still poses a challenge for the coin to achieve higher prices, as an ever-increasing supply requires proportionally higher demand to sustain or boost valuations. For DOGE to reach $1, its market cap would need to exceed $147 billion based on the current circulating supply‚Äîsignificantly more than its previous all-time high market cap of $88.8 billion during its peak price of $0.73 on May 8, 2021. At that time, the circulating supply was significantly smaller, which allowed the price to surge higher with relatively less capital inflow compared to today. If Dogecoin were to achieve its previous all-time high market cap of $88.8 billion with today‚Äôs circulating supply, its price would only reach $0.62, highlighting the direct impact of its inflationary supply dynamics. This means DOGE needs continuous and substantial increases in demand, well beyond historical levels, to sustain or surpass its previous price highs. What would it take for Dogecoin to reach $1? Dogecoin‚Äôs journey to $1 would require an unprecedented level of market interest and adoption. Factors such as increased mainstream adoption, integration into payment systems, and broader utility beyond speculative trading would need to drive consistent demand. Additionally, DOGE would need to outperform other top cryptocurrencies in attracting capital. In the short term, key technical levels to watch include a support zone at $0.2843, which has historically acted as a safety net during price corrections, and a resistance zone at $0.3545, which must be breached to regain bullish momentum. Breaking through these levels is essential for DOGE to make meaningful progress toward its psychological barrier of $1. Can history repeat itself? Dogecoin‚Äôs all-time high of $0.73 in May 2021 was fueled by a combination of social media hype, celebrity endorsements, and retail investor enthusiasm. Replicating such conditions in 2025 would require a similar confluence of factors, coupled with sustained demand from institutional investors and broader use cases. However, with its current inflationary supply dynamics, even if DOGE matched its 2021 market cap, its price would be around 15% lower, underscoring the challenge of regaining or exceeding its previous peak.

38049529,https://invezz.com/?p=2403102,1735040522,Cosmos Network developers move $27.8 million in Bitcoin,"Cosmos Network developers have recently sold off Bitcoin, increasing market pressure and sparking concerns over price stability. The move has drawn significant attention from the crypto community, given the scale of the sales and their potential impact on the broader market. With 295.3 BTC worth $27.8 million sold at a price of $94,410.82 each, these sales follow earlier Ethereum transfers totalling $10.16 million in November. This year alone, Cosmos developers have offloaded $78.67 million worth of BTC and ETH, yet they retain $67 million in crypto assets, including 96.4 BTC and 17,188 ETH, showcasing their careful strategy amidst market turbulence. Amid this selling spree, Bitcoin‚Äôs price remains fragile, falling by 11.43% in the past week, raising questions about market resilience and the potential for recovery. The current market dynamics indicate that such large transactions can significantly affect sentiment and price direction. What‚Äôs driving Cosmos‚Äô strategy? The sales may stem from Cosmos developers leveraging ICO funds raised in 2017, during which Bitcoin and Ethereum donations played a crucial role. Despite these sales, the developers still hold substantial reserves, hinting at a calculated approach to manage liquidity and risk during a bearish market phase. Analysts speculate that these transactions aim to capitalise on high-value holdings while minimising potential losses as the crypto market faces broader headwinds and continued volatility. This selling activity coincides with Ethereum‚Äôs 14.79% weekly decline, amplifying concerns about a cascading effect on other cryptocurrencies. However, Cosmos developers‚Äô continued retention of BTC and ETH reserves demonstrates a balanced approach, ensuring they maintain significant exposure to future market rallies. The broader market remains watchful of such activities, as large sales can destabilise prices, particularly in volatile conditions. Bitcoin price struggles as market momentum weakens The Cosmos sell-off adds pressure to Bitcoin markets, particularly in low-liquidity conditions where large transactions exacerbate downward trends. The BTC/USD trading pair shows bearish signals, with the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator reflecting negative momentum. A crossover above the signal line, combined with the histogram falling below zero, suggests that selling activity may persist in the near term, potentially weighing on Bitcoin‚Äôs performance further. However, the situation isn‚Äôt entirely bearish. Market observers note that a bullish reversal is possible if MACD indicators shift positively, signalling renewed demand and improved sentiment. Bitcoin‚Äôs current price action reflects a critical juncture, leaving it vulnerable to further declines or poised for recovery based on external factors and investor behaviour. Factors such as institutional interest and macroeconomic shifts could still influence Bitcoin‚Äôs trajectory and offset selling pressure. The broader crypto market‚Äôs performance will likely influence Bitcoin‚Äôs trajectory, with macroeconomic conditions and regulatory developments playing pivotal roles. For now, the Cosmos-related sales serve as a microcosm of the challenges facing cryptocurrencies in a volatile environment, where liquidity and sentiment remain critical.

Corporations, U.S. governments, and BRICS nations are potentially racing to adopt Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Falling Bitcoin dominance - down¬†6%¬†MoM, the sharpest drop since 2022 - signals a broader crypto rally underway. Bitcoin‚Äôs historic rally, accelerating corporate and state adoption, and the onset of altcoin season signal a broader crypto bull market, with BTC potentially reaching $180k by 2025. Please note that VanEck has exposure to bitcoin. Bitcoin's Price Action Market sentiment: Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) made history this month, breaking above $100k on December 5th and reaching a peak of $108k by December 17th. As we anticipated in last month's ChainCheck , indicators like perp funding rates and relative unrealized profits continue to signal that we have entered the stage of the cycle with the greatest one- to six-month upside potential. This month, the rally‚Äôs momentum is underpinned by three unprecedented forces: Bitcoin‚Äôs growing adoption as an institutional reserve asset, rising altcoin speculation, and powerful synergies between crypto and AI. While we expect multiple 20% retracements and possibly a 40% drawdown on the path to our 10% For Months Would be Bearish"" target=""_blank""> $180k price target , these drivers suggest an acceleration of Bitcoin‚Äôs upward trajectory into 2025. Bitcoin Treasury Adoption Institutional corporate and sovereign treasuries made unprecedented moves to adopt Bitcoin this month. Among corporates, a major milestone came as the Nasdaq-100 added MicroStrategy ( MSTR ), the world‚Äôs largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. As a result, funds and ETFs tracking the Nasdaq-100 will now have exposure to MSTR‚Äôs ~439k Bitcoin, marking a milestone in Bitcoin‚Äôs adoption in traditional financial markets and paving the way for potential S&P 500 inclusion. Sovereign nations are following closely, with President-elect Donald Trump emphasizing the U.S.‚Äôs plan to compete with BRICS nations in energy, AI, and crypto dominance through deregulation and a national strategic Bitcoin reserve. However, like corporates and retail investors, even individual U.S. states are beginning to effectively front-run national treasuries in their race to adopt Bitcoin. State-Level Bitcoin Competition in the U.S. November 19th : Pennsylvania Representative Mike Cabell introduced legislation to form the Pennsylvania Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, proposing allocating up to 10% of the state's $7 billion reserve to Bitcoin. December 3rd: The Florida Blockchain Business Association (FBBA) stated that there is a ‚Äúvery good chance‚Äù of establishing a state strategic Bitcoin reserve in 2025, highlighted by pro-Bitcoin leadership in the state legislature and existing pension fund investments in crypto-related assets. This follows Florida's CFO Jimmy Patronis' recommendation for the state to direct a portion of its retirement system into crypto. Similarly, Wisconsin and Michigan pension funds have already begun diversifying into Bitcoin. December 9th: In Alabama, State Auditor Andrew Sorrell stated, ‚ÄúThe debate over whether crypto will succeed has ended. Now, the fight for which states will benefit from it has begun."" December 12th: In Texas, State Representative Giovanni Capriglione, Chair of the Texas Pensions, Investments, and Financial Services Committee, officially filed for a Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve bill. December 17th: Ohio state representative Derek Merrin filed the Ohio Bitcoin Reserve Act to hold Bitcoin within the state treasury. These state-level developments demonstrate the economic game theory driving Bitcoin adoption, setting the stage for broader national and international competition. National Bitcoin Policy: The BITCOIN Act and FASB‚Äôs Impact Betting Markets Gain Confidence in U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Sources: Kalshi, Polymarket as of 12/17/2024. At the national level, Bitcoin adoption is accelerating with significant policy and regulatory developments: December 12th: After ringing the opening bell at the NYSE, President-elect Donald Trump reaffirmed support for the BITCOIN Act and confirmed his intent to establish a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. When asked about creating a Bitcoin reserve similar to the nation‚Äôs oil reserve, Trump responded, ‚ÄúYeah, I think so. We‚Äôre going to do something great with crypto because we don‚Äôt want China or anybody else‚Äînot just China‚Äîbut others are embracing it, and we want to be the head."" This builds on Trump‚Äôs campaign promise at the Bitcoin 2024 Conference in July, where he pledged to create a ""strategic national Bitcoin reserve"" and predicted Bitcoin could surpass gold‚Äôs $16 trillion market cap. December 16th : The U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) adopted new rules allowing companies to value Bitcoin at current market prices, fully effective in 2025. Previously, companies could only report Bitcoin at its purchase price, recording impairments but ignoring gains. This distorted financial statements and discouraged adoption. New rules ensure companies can report gains and losses based on market prices, improving transparency and simplifying Bitcoin‚Äôs adoption as a corporate reserve asset. BRICS Nations Take a Head Start While U.S. initiatives gain momentum, BRICS ( Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa ) nations are already advancing their efforts to integrate Bitcoin to circumvent U.S. sanctions and reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar. Russia: Since the BRICS Business Forum in mid-October, Russia has prioritized Bitcoin adoption. The country has partnered with BRICS allies to construct Bitcoin mining and AI facilities. In November, President Vladimir Putin proposed a BRICS investment platform using digital assets and later signed a law recognizing digital currencies as property for foreign trade settlements under an experimental legal regime (ELR). Brazil: In late November, Brazilian Congressman Eros Biondini introduced legislation for the country to acquire Bitcoin until it comprises 5% of Brazil‚Äôs international reserves. This move signals Brazil‚Äôs strategic intent to diversify its reserves and align with Bitcoin‚Äôs rising global prominence. China: Predictions at the Bitcoin MENA 2024 Conference by Anthony Scaramucci and Changpeng Zhao suggest that China may soon reintegrate Bitcoin mining operations and reserves. If realized, this would mark a significant shift in China‚Äôs stance, further solidifying Bitcoin‚Äôs role in global economic systems. Clearly, BRICS nations are positioning Bitcoin as a key tool in their strategy to de-dollarize and bolster economic resilience. Their coordinated efforts demonstrate an effort to challenge Western economic dominance. Emerging Global Players and Cities Beyond the BRICS nations, other countries and cities are accelerating Bitcoin adoption, highlighting its growing relevance as a reserve asset and financial innovation tool. Suriname: In late October, Suriname‚Äôs presidential candidate, Maya Prabhoe, outlined plans to replace the Suriname dollar with Bitcoin as the national currency and issue Bitcoin bonds. United Kingdom: In early November, British pension specialist Cartwright guided the country‚Äôs first pension fund to allocate 3% of its total assets into Bitcoin. Poland: On November 17th, Presidential candidate Slawomir Mentzen proposed a national Bitcoin reserve and pledged to make Poland ‚Äúa cryptocurrency haven‚Äù if elected in 2025. Japan: On December 11th, Japanese lawmaker Satoshi Yamada submitted a letter to the country‚Äôs House of Councillors, noting ‚Äúthe trend of establishing Bitcoin reserves in the United States and other countries‚Äù and asking, ‚ÄúShould Japan also introduce a system to convert part of its foreign exchange reserves into crypto assets such as Bitcoin?‚Äù Vancouver, Canada: Also on December 11th, Vancouver councilors passed a motion forwarded by Mayor Ken Sim titled ‚ÄúBecoming a Bitcoin-Friendly City. "" The motion advocates using Bitcoin as a reserve asset and accepting it for tax payments and fees. Australia: Revealed in a December 12th report, Australia‚Äôs AMP became the first major superannuation (retirement) fund to buy Bitcoin, having acquired $27M of Bitcoin in May 2024. France: Speaking in Brussels on Monday, December 16th, French Legislator and European Parliament member Sarah Knafo declared her support for a strategic national Bitcoin reserve while denouncing the digital euro, a proposed central bank digital currency (CBDC) proposed by the European Central Bank. Accelerating Institutional Bitcoin Adoption Corporates, Governments, and Funds are Buying Retail‚Äôs Bitcoin ((BTC)) Source: bitcointreasuries.net as of 12/17/2024, Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Between Q4 2022 and Q4 2024, corporates added ~162k BTC, governments ~377k BTC, and ETFs/investment funds ~329k BTC to their reserves. It is important to note that governments‚Äô BTC holdings largely stem from criminal seizures, primarily in the U.S., China, and Germany‚Äîthough we expect this to shift towards deliberate open-market purchases like El Salvador‚Äôs in the coming years. As of December 17th, 69 public companies hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets, a number we expect to surpass 100 in 2025 . On December 9th, Jetking Infotrain became India‚Äôs first publicly traded company to add Bitcoin to its balance sheet. MicroStrategy, Marathon, and Riot continued their industry-leading accumulation of Bitcoin, adding ~128.8k BTC , ~6,500 BTC , and ~5,800 BTC, respectively, since mid-November. Of course, many major decision-makers remain unconvinced. On December 10th, Microsoft shareholders nearly unanimously rejected a proposal to put Bitcoin on its balance sheet at a weighting of 1% of its total assets. Regardless, the total Bitcoin held by private and public entities now stands at ~985k BTC, on track to surpass Satoshi Nakamoto‚Äôs estimated holdings of 1.1 million BTC by 2025. Such rapid accumulation demonstrates a growing belief in Bitcoin‚Äôs credibility as an institutional reserve asset. Governments‚Äô aggregate decrease in BTC holdings from Q3 2024 to today can be primarily attributed to Germany‚Äôs selling of all ~50,000 BTC it had seized. At an average sales price of $57.6k , Germany‚Äôs BTC sale has reached a ~$2.5 billion opportunity cost when measured against December 17th‚Äôs price of ~108k per BTC . We believe the U.S. should avoid repeating Germany‚Äôs mistake. While critics like Peter Schiff have urged President Biden to sell the U.S.‚Äôs Bitcoin before Trump‚Äôs inauguration, a well-managed reserve could provide significant long-term value. The analysis below illustrates this potential. Modeling BITCOIN Act Scenarios We modeled outcomes based on the BITCOIN Act of 2024, introduced by Senator Cynthia Lummis. The Act proposes that the U.S. Treasury acquire 1 million BTC over five years to counter rising inflation and global de-dollarization risks. However, even without legislation, there are several steps Trump could take via executive action to initiate such a reserve: Halt the sale of Bitcoin from the U.S. asset forfeiture reserve (~198k BTC). Revalue gold certificates‚Äîcurrently priced at 1970s levels‚Äîto today‚Äôs value, unlocking ~$693 billion in unrealized capital. Leverage the $ 49.7 billion Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF) under the authority of the Treasury Secretary. While the U.S. awaits a broader legislative framework for holding Bitcoin as a national reserve, the BITCOIN Act‚Äôs proposed 200,000 BTC first-year acquisition could be covered by repurposing seized Bitcoin. The remaining 800,000 BTC could be financed through the ESF and/or diversification away from the Treasury‚Äôs gold reserves‚Äîall without requiring money printing or taxpayer funds. Estimated U.S. Debt vs. Bitcoin Reserve Growth (assuming 25% BTC CAGR) For illustration only. Assumptions U.S. Debt Value Starting Debt (2025) $37,000,000,000,000 Debt CAGR 5.0% Final U.S. Debt Value (2049) (USD Trillions) $119.3 Bitcoin Treasury Value BTC Price In 2025 $200,000 BTC CAGR 25.0% Total BTC Purchased by 2029 1,000,000 Final Bitcoin Treasury Value (2049) (USD Trillions) $42.4 Bitcoin Adoption Implied BTC Price $42,351,647 Est.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Our analysis suggests that if the U.S. government follows the BITCOIN Act‚Äôs proposed trajectory‚Äîacquiring 1 million BTC by 2029‚Äîthe reserve could represent an estimated 35% of the national debt by 2049, offsetting ~$42 trillion of liabilities. This optimistic scenario assumes that U.S. debt compounds at 5.0% from a base of $37 trillion from 2025 to 2049, while Bitcoin compounds at 25% annually over the same period from a starting value of $200,000, implying a value of ~$42.3 million per Bitcoin in 2049. Assuming today‚Äôs ~$900 trillion of total global financial assets compound at 7.0% from 2025 to 2049, Bitcoin would represent 18% of global financial assets in this scenario. Altcoin Season has Started Altcoin Season Indicator: Began on November 27 th Source: Artemis as of 12/16/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Because Bitcoin dominates crypto markets in terms of market cap, liquidity, and volume, its sustained performance often creates the conditions for so-called ‚Äòaltcoins‚Äô ‚Äîany cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin‚Äîto perform. As new capital flows into the crypto markets, risk-on sentiment and wealth effects give rise to more nascent crypto applications like those involved with decentralized finance, gaming, and NFTs. The chart shows how many of the top 50 altcoins (by market cap) outperform Bitcoin over a 90-day period. If more than 60% of these altcoins outperform Bitcoin, it signals 'alt season,' when leading altcoins dominate performance. BTC Price Returns After Altcoin Season Indicator >= 0.60 Begins (Jan 2017 - Present) Duration of Indicator (Days) n = Average 1m Return (%) Average 3m Return (%) Average 6m Return (%) All 61 10 30 73 41 11 25 71 7-30 15 9 50 76 >30 5 0 12 81 % of Time BTC Returns are Positive 'X' Months After Indicator >= 0.60 Begins (Jan 2017 - Present) Duration of Indicator (Days) n = Average 1m Return (%) Average 3m Return (%) Average 6m Return (%) All 61 59 62 66 41 59 61 63 7-30 15 60 73 73 >30 5 60 60 60 Source: VanEck Research as of 12/16/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. In this exercise, we analyzed the average 1, 3, and 6-month returns for BTC after the Altcoin Season Index crossed the 60% threshold. We found that, on average, Bitcoin returns +10%, +30%, and +73% during the proceeding 1, 3, and 6 months after altcoin season begins, respectively. Notably, these returns increase as the duration of the altcoin season indicator increases. As of December 17th, this alt season indicator has been flashing for the past 20 days, suggesting that Bitcoin will perform even more strongly in the 3- to 6-month time horizons following November 27th than it would if the indicator had flashed for less than 7 days. Taking Bitcoin‚Äôs opening price of ~$92k on November 27th, the average 6-month returns of 76% and 81% following medium- to long-term Altcoin Season indicators would imply May 27th, 2025, Bitcoin prices of $161,920 to $166,520 , respectively. This tracks closely with our Bitcoin price target of $180,000 for this cycle. We also measured the historical ‚Äòhit rate‚Äô of Bitcoin‚Äôs price, making positive returns in the 1, 3, and 6-months following the onset of altcoin season indicators. Curiously, with a nearly 75% hit rate, indicators lasting between 7-30 days stand out from those less than a week or more than a month in duration. We believe this is explained by short-lived indicators being triggered more sporadically throughout market cycles, making them less predictive of sustained Bitcoin upside. Keeping in mind their considerably smaller sample size, we believe altcoin season indicators exceeding 30 days could be more reflective of peak market conditions. In contrast, indicators lasting only 7-30 days suggest more room for upside in the following three to six months. Whether the current altcoin season indicator lasts 30+ days or not, these results reinforce our confidence in a diversified crypto rally heading into 2025. Bitcoin Miners This month, we updated our outlook on Bitcoin miners as the investing public and politicians become more aware of the intersections between crypto, AI, and energy.

To begin, we categorized Bitcoin mining companies into three major categories. BTC pure plays are Bitcoin miners who remain committed to maximizing their Bitcoin mining productivity. Opposite of BTC pure plays are so-called ‚ÄúPivotooors,‚Äù colloquially referring to miners who have pivoted some amount of their existing Bitcoin mining capacity towards AI/HPC workloads. The third category, ‚ÄúHOLDers,‚Äù are Bitcoin miners whose Bitcoin holdings comprise 20% or more of the company‚Äôs enterprise value‚Äîan increasingly popular strategy in light of MicroStrategy‚Äôs emergence as a household name for ‚ÄúHOLDing‚Äù Bitcoin like nobody else. After categorizing these miners, we retrospectively analyzed each category‚Äôs average returns over the last one, three, six, and twelve months. Across all time horizons, AI/HPC Pivotooors performed best, HOLDers performed second best, and BTC pure plays performed worst. Given the revenue stability and capital efficiency of AI/HPC workloads, these results make sense. Core Scientific‚Äôs partnership with cloud-computing hyperscaler CoreWeave highlights this trend: by repurposing 700 MW of its 1200 MW of contracted power, Core Scientific expects to earn ~$1.04M per MW annually, delivering predictable, long-term cash flows. By comparison, based on its November production report, we estimate that Core Scientific earned an annualized ~$0.64M per each of its 500 MW dedicated to Bitcoin mining, even at elevated Bitcoin sales prices averaging ~$85k . In contrast, traditional Bitcoin mining faces high capital costs due to constant hardware upgrades, compounded by limited access to cheap credit. This often forces miners to dilute shares to finance operations. By pivoting to AI/HPC infrastructure, miners can achieve more sustainable margins and position themselves for data center REIT-like valuations. Currently, they are trading at ~20‚Äì25x EV/EBITDA, significantly above the multiples of Bitcoin mining alone. As miners diversify into stable, high-margin services, this revaluation potential presents a compelling opportunity for investors. As Bitcoin is up ~153% YTD, it makes sense that HOLDers‚Äîessentially leveraged long BTC‚Äîhave outperformed pure-play miners. However, because this strategy remains undiversified from Bitcoin‚Äôs performance, we do not think it is as viable of a long-term strategy as pivoting into AI/HPC. Lastly, we note that Bitdeer (BTDR), up 108% MoM, is in a category of its own as the only vertically integrated Bitcoin miner in our list. BTDR‚Äôs large and globally diversified power portfolio, ongoing Tier 3 AI/HPC data center pivot, and R&D focus on its Bitcoin mining SEAL chips give the company significant strategic optionality. We believe the future of Bitcoin mining will shift away from standalone facilities, with a growing share of global hashrate coming from operations that utilize excess capacity from anchor tenants like AI/HPC data centers, industrial energy grids, and remote energy production. In such a landscape, the optionality of owning energy, AI/HPC infrastructure, and proprietary chip technology will likely prove more resilient than Bitcoin mining alone.

We examined the enterprise value of Bitcoin miners relative to their current and near-term target energy capacities. Despite its recent gains, we note that RIOT, IREN, BITF, and BTDR appear cheap by this measure. While Bit Digital ((BTBT)) looks expensive, this can be explained by the recent termination of its 36 MW in colocation mining services from Coinmint. Further, because it is not currently under construction, most of BTBT‚Äôs 288 MW expansion pipeline is not reflected in this table and chart. Additionally, the company‚Äôs significant investments in Ethereum staking and AI/HPC infrastructure differentiate it, making this metric less straightforward for assessment.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Bitcoin‚Äôs Network Activity, Adoption, and Fees Daily Inscriptions: Inscriptions transactions surged 134% month-over-month but remain down 52% year-over-year (YoY), suggesting signs of life in speculative onchain activity on Bitcoin. This aligns with broader NFT market enthusiasm, as evidenced by Pudgy Penguins NFTs surpassing $100k this month. Active Supply: The percent of Bitcoin‚Äôs supply active in the past 180 days is up 18% month-over-month (MoM) and 29% YoY, suggesting that elevated prices are waking up dormant wallets. However, supply dormant for 3+ years fell 1% MoM and is only up 10% YoY, suggesting most activity is concentrated among younger wallets. Average Fees: Average fees decreased modestly month-over-month, 11% in USD terms. While they appear to be down significantly YoY, this is due to last December‚Äôs network congestion caused by Bitcoin ordinals and BRC-20s spiking in popularity ahead of bullish ETF sentiment. Global Power Consumption & Mining Difficulty: Global power consumption reached 151 TWh , and mining difficulty rose 8% Month over Month, both hitting all-time highs. This reflects a robust and growing network as miners scale operations to meet rising Bitcoin demand. Total Crypto Equities Market Cap: The total market cap for crypto equities rose 14% MoM to a new all-time high, driven by strong BTC miner revenues, which remain near record levels. Daily BTC miner revenues increased 20% MoM, benefiting from elevated Bitcoin prices. Transfer Volume from Miners to Exchanges: Transfer volume from miners to exchanges fell 82% MoM, but last month‚Äôs spike distorts this figure. Overall, miner selling appears to have stabilized at modestly higher levels than in previous months, indicating increased but not yet worrisome miner profit-taking. Bitcoin Dominance: Bitcoin dominance fell 6% MoM, the sharpest one-month decline since 2022. This aligns with our analysis indicating the onset of Altcoin Season . Futures Sentiment: Annualized Bitcoin futures basis rose 13% MoM, reflecting growing bullish sentiment. At the 85th percentile of historical levels, funding remains elevated but not extreme.

Helio Pay allows these users to accept payments in Bitcoin, Ether, stablecoins such as USD Coin (USDC), and hundreds of other cryptocurrencies. Among its most notable integrations is Solana Pay on Shopify, one of the largest e-commerce platforms globally, with over 138 million monthly users. Expanding Reach in Crypto Payments MoonPay‚Äôs user base, which spans more than 160 countries with 20 million users, would benefit from Helio Pay‚Äôs established merchant network and its advanced e-commerce integrations. This potential acquisition aligns with MoonPay‚Äôs recent efforts to innovate within the crypto payment space. In November, the company launched MoonPay Balance, a fiat-to-crypto on-ramp designed to facilitate easier interaction with decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. The feature supports users in 27 countries, primarily in Europe, though key markets like the United States and Germany were excluded. MoonPay has also been expanding its fiat integration capabilities. Earlier this year, it introduced fiat PayPal on-ramps for customers in the European Union and the United Kingdom, following a successful launch in the United States. Future Implications for Crypto E-Commerce An acquisition of Helio Pay would enhance MoonPay‚Äôs position as a leader in the crypto payment space , bridging the gap between traditional finance and blockchain-based solutions. By merging Helio‚Äôs innovative e-commerce tools with MoonPay‚Äôs extensive infrastructure, the combined entity could drive broader adoption of cryptocurrency in everyday transactions. Neither MoonPay nor Helio Pay has commented on the reports. However, if the deal proceeds, it would underline the increasing convergence of crypto and mainstream e-commerce, paving the way for more seamless global payment solutions.

VanEck Answers As Bitcoin Price Struggles Below $100,000","The recent Bitcoin price action has been marked by a correction from its all-time high of $108,135 achieved just a week ago. Although Bitcoin has largely held up above the $90,000 mark, the correction has seen the cryptocurrency falling to as low as $92,500 in the past 24 hours. This decline has not only shaken confidence in Bitcoin‚Äôs immediate trajectory but has also turned attention toward the altcoin market. Although the altcoin market has also mirrored this trend of Bitcoin‚Äôs price correction, many investors and analysts are expecting an altcoin rally very soon. VanEck weighed in on this expectation with a confident declaration on the social media platform X. According to the investment firm, the crypto industry is currently in an altcoin season that started on November 27. Altcoin Season Is Here Already‚ÄîVanEck Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, has struggled to maintain its price momentum above the $100,000 mark, raising questions about where the market might head next. While many Bitcoin proponents are expecting a renewed surge in 2025 with the incoming Trump administration in the US, other crypto analysts are turning to the altcoin market. Interestingly, analysts at VanEck suggest that the current crypto environment may favor altcoins against Bitcoin. Related Reading: XRP Price On Its Way To $10 In Only 3 Months If It Follows This Pattern Matthew Sigel, head of digital research at VanEck, elaborated on this phenomenon, explaining that Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance in terms of market cap, liquidity, and volume often lays the groundwork for altcoins to outperform. According to Sigel, as capital flows into the market, risk-on sentiment tends to boost nascent crypto applications, particularly those in decentralized finance, gaming, and NFTs, which in turn allows the altcoin market to outperform Bitcoin. VanEck‚Äôs outlook on the altcoin season also highlighted data from Artemis‚Äôs Altcoin Season Index, which measures how many of the top 50 altcoins outperform Bitcoin over a 90-day period. According to this index, which ranges from a value of 0 to 1, the altcoin season starts with a reading of 0.6. At the time of writing, the index is currently well above this level, having recently reached 0.8. This suggests that the crypto industry is currently in an altcoin season where profits taken from Bitcoin will start to flow into top altcoins. Diverging Views On Current Metrics Interestingly, Artemis‚Äôs Altcoin Season Index differs from more conventional metrics, such as those provided by CoinMarketCap. CoinMarketCap defines an altcoin season as a period when 75% of the top 100 altcoins outperform Bitcoin over the last 90 days. By this measure, the index currently sits at 51, though it peaked at an impressive 87 on December 4.

38046329,https://crypto.news/?p=14321869,1735039152,Daiwa Securities CEO pushes for Japan crypto ETF approval amidst slumping China profits,"CEO of Daiwa Securities believes Japan should allow for crypto exchange-traded funds to enter the local market. Daiwa is one of the many companies pushing for Japan to approve crypto ETFs. According to a Bloomberg report published on Dec. 24, Akihiko Ogino, Chief Executive Officer of the second largest brokerage in Japan, said in an interview that Japan should allow for crypto ETFs to ‚Äúdebut in the country.‚Äù At the time of writing, Daiwa itself has an index-based exchange-traded fund in the Japan market, labeled Daiwa ETF Nikkei 225. Though, Ogino did not reveal any plans for Daiwa to start filing their own crypto-backed ETF. Daiwa is not the only firm pushing for crypto ETFs. Last October, major Japanese financial firms such as Mitsubishi UFJ, Sumitomo Mitsui and Nomura securities, all backed a proposal that asked the Japanese government to prioritize Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) for crypto-backed ETFs. However, many believe that it is still difficult for Japan to embrace crypto-backed ETFs due to its ‚Äúregulatory constraints‚Äù as well as negative perception towards crypto because of past incidents such as Mt. Gox and DMM. Additionally, Ogino predicted that Japan‚Äôs central bank seems set on tightening monetary policies even further as corporate profits begin to grow along with the early signs of inflations. You might also like: Major Japanese companies want to prioritize Bitcoin and Ether for crypto ETFs Daiwa expects the Bank of Japan to increase the nation‚Äôs policy interest rate in January next year by 25 basis points, from 0.25% to 0.5%. The brokerage also expect the central bank to raise it again by the end of 2025 to 0.75%. Based on the BOJ‚Äôs reduction of Japanese government debt purchases, Ogino concluded that ‚Äúthe volume of bonds available for the market will increase, which will likely stimulate trading.‚Äù Daiwa is currently having a hard time gaining profit in its China market. Ogino said that it is ‚Äúa bit questionable‚Äù whether the brokerage will be able to make profit in the new year ahead. Thus, the firm is exploring ways to turn profit in 2026 instead. ‚ÄúThe reality is that the pace of the Chinese market over the past year hasn‚Äôt been as good as expected,‚Äù adds Ogino. According to official data, the combined revenue of securities firms in China fell by 9% to 203.3 billion yuan ($27.9 billion) in the first half compared to the previous year. In addition, company stated that it will be raising employee wages in April 2025 to ‚Äúaround 5% or perhaps more.‚Äù The CEO said that the firm wants to ‚Äúappropriately grow and train‚Äù its existing staff to trade successfully in yen rates, without having to add new recruits.

38046270,https://crypto.news/?p=14321876,1735039069,Russia to impose regional controls over crypto mining starting Jan 2025,"Russia‚Äôs government has published a draft resolution on banning or providing restrictions on mining locally. The ban will take effect on Jan. 1, 2025, and run until Mar. 15, 2031. According to TASS , the mining ban will take place in Dagestan, Ingushetia, Chechnya, Kabardino-Balkaria and North Ossetia. The ban will include mining and participation in pools. The order has also not been entered into force in Luhansk and Donetsk People‚Äôs Republics, as well as some localities of Zaporizhia and Kherson.

By 2025, this will be enforced between Jan. 1 and Mar. 15, with the years to follow seeing bans take effect from Nov. 15 through Mar. 15. This is a set of policies that manage how much energy is consumed and distribute it evenly across different industries. Experts are of the opinion that the crypto mining ban is due to energy shortages and the subsidized price at which bandwidth is available in some markets. Sergey Kolobanov, the Center for Strategic Research of this mechanism, has become one of the arguments to justify restrictions on interregional cross-subsidization, which compensates for cheap energy in regulated regions. Kolobanov states that the limitation is in line with the end of the transition period aimed at removing such benefits. Power privatization is expected to eliminate the need for such bans one day. You might also like: Crypto mining giant Marathon plans $700m convertible note to buy Bitcoin The Cabinet of Ministers added that a similar list could be revised in the light of proposals from an electricity commission advising on what such zones might comprise. Experts say the authorities justified the ban on the grounds of energy shortages and price disparities in electricity. The regulated contract states in question enjoy lower electricity prices, which are effectively cross-subsidized by the producers and consumers of other regions. Earlier, Russia imposed 15% tax rule on Bitcoin ( BTC ) mining profits on Nov. 18. The world‚Äôs largest country‚Äôs current mining ban is a result of ongoing energy shortages and differentiated electricity pricing, as per a previous TASS report . Further, World Energy Outlook 2023 states that Russia‚Äôs power generation decreased in 2022 due to lower industrial demand and export sanctions, while electricity consumption increased by 5.8% in industrial regions by mid-2023. Subsidized regions such as Irkutsk, where electricity is sold at $0.01 per kWh, attracted miners and straining grids during winter peaks. The ban will help address energy equity and balance such imbalances while preparing to privatize power frameworks.

Announcing the third rate cut of the year, Fed Chair Jerome Powell hinted that the organisation would take a cautious approach when considering any future rate cuts. Now, experts suggest that there is a 40% probability that the Federal Reserve will increase interest rate in 2025. Shocking! Here is what you should know! Federal Reserve Faces 40% Rate Hike Odds in 2025 Among those expecting a rate hike is Apollo Global Management, a leading provider of alternative asset management and retirement solutions. The firm predicts that there is at least 40% probability that the US Fed will consider a rate hike in 2025. Inflation Above 2% Challenges the Fed‚Äôs Plans At the start of this year, the US Inflation Rate was at 3.1%. In March, it touched a yearly peak of 3.5%. Between March and September, it consistently declined; in September, it reached a yearly low of 2.4%. Since then, it has grown steadily. In October, it reached 2.6%, and in November, it climbed to 2.7%. The consistent growth in the inflation rate is a matter of serious concern in the United States. The country‚Äôs ultimate target is to bring down the inflation rate down to 2%. Experts believe that unless the inflation trend reverses, the Fed cannot consider any further interest rate cuts. Economic Strength Supports Rate Hike Predictions The strength of the US economy is a key factor behind the rate hike predictions. Robust economic activity can contribute to sustained inflationary pressures, further complicating monetary policy decisions. In conclusion, as inflation remains stubbornly above the Fed‚Äôs target, the potential for rate hikes in 2025 highlights the delicate balancing act facing policymakers.

Kiyosaki blasts ‚ÄòBitcoin cry babies‚Äô as BTC price drops,"After Bitcoin ( BTC ) hit a record high of about $108,000, the asset has retreated, facing the threat of dropping below the $90,000 support zone as hopes of a possible Santa rally fade. With this price drop, Robert Kiyosaki , the author of the best-selling personal finance book ‚Äò Rich Dad Poor Dad‚Äô , has addressed Bitcoin investors disheartened by the bearish trajectory. Kiyosaki criticized what he described as ‚Äúcry babies,‚Äù complaining about the decline instead of seizing the opportunity to buy more, according to his X post on December 24. Known for his bullish stance on Bitcoin, the celebrity investor emphasized that market dips are moments to be grateful for, urging investors to view them as buying opportunities rather than reasons for concern. ‚ÄúBoo Hoo Boo Hoo: BITCOIN CRY BABIES crying about Bitcoin prices dropping down.

It is worth noting that Kiyosaki‚Äôs prediction of a major economic crash has been a subject of debate. In addition to the digital asset, the author has advocated investing in precious metals, including gold and silver , maintaining that they all serve the same purpose and should not be involved in a supremacy battle. In line with accumulating Bitcoin, Kiyosaki, in a Finbold report , expressed gratitude to Bitcoin investors for putting money away from traditional finance assets. According to Kiyosaki, investing in Bitcoin alongside precious metals is a way to refuse to place trust in conventional financial institutions, which he describes as a ‚ÄúDen of Thieves.‚Äù Bitcoin price analysis Bitcoin was trading at $93,810 at press time, down over 2% on the daily chart and a massive 12% on the weekly timeframe.

The expert stressed that as long as Bitcoin fails to achieve a weekly close above $95,221, selling pressure is expected to persist. Conversely, a weekly close below $92,140 could trigger an even sharper price decline. The first major support zone is between $92,000 and $90,000. Should this level break, the next area of interest will be between $90,000 and $82,000. On the other hand, the final significant support range sits between $82,000 and $75,000. Below $75,000, further downside targets are not currently being considered. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView/Market Maestro While brief intraday wicks could dip below these levels, the focus remains on weekly closes, as they carry more weight in determining the longer-term trend. Several elements suggest that Bitcoin‚Äôs correction might be temporary, as the asset has an arsenal of fundamental factors likely to spur future price growth. For instance, BTC is still benefiting from optimism tied to Donald Trump‚Äôs election win , whose campaign promised to spearhead the initiation of pro-crypto policies. To this end, some analysts maintain that in an environment of friendly regulations and institutional inflows, Bitcoin could hit a high of $200,000 in 2025.

The SUI token has increased by 4.24% over the past 24 hours, reaching the $4.50 psychological mark. With a market cap of $13.24 billion, the recovery hints at a potential bull run before the end of 2024.Will this recovery lead to a price jump beyond the $5 milestone? Let‚Äôs find out.SUI Price AnalysisCurrently, the SUI token is trading at $4.5370 with an intraday pullback of 3.66%. This marks a bearish exhaustion after the overnight recovery of 9%. The surge last night created a bullish engulfing candle to complete a morning star pattern.¬†This resulted in a 24-hour high of $4.75. In the 4-hour price chart, the SUI token showcases a bullish dominance at the local support trendline, resulting in two consecutive engulfing candles. SUI Price Chart The recovery run breached the 50% Fibonacci level but failed to sustain the bullish dominance. With three consecutive bearish candles, the minor intraday pullback creates a triple black crow setup.¬†This breaks under the 50% Fibonacci level and is heading to challenge the 50 EMA line at $4.42. Furthermore, it puts the $4.50 psychological mark at risk and warns of another retest of the local support trendline.¬†SUI Network Nears $2B in TVLDuring the overnight recovery, the SUI network surpassed the $1.75 billion valuation in the total value locked over this month. Currently, it is sitting at $1.782 billion, witnessing a 12% surge over the last 30 days. SUI TVL SUI's stablecoin market cap is nearing the $400 million mark and is currently at $388.72 million. Meanwhile, the 24-hour volume stands at $409.28 million. With the improvement in numbers, the SUI network TVL is nearing the $2 billion milestone, reflecting network growth.¬†SUI Price TargetsUsing the trend-based Fibonacci levels, the short-term pullback in SUI targets a potential retest of the 38.20% Fibonacci level at $4.20. However, the constant support at local support levels and the underlying demand hint at a potential run to the $5 psychological milestone.¬†Furthermore, the rising channel pattern showcases a bullish potential to reach the overhead trendline near the 78.60% Fibonacci level at $5.71. Hence, despite the short-term pullback and the broader market volatility, the underlying potential for SUI reveals an upside of nearly 30%.",NEUTRAL,SUI,MARKET | TRADING | SUI,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/24/sui-price-analysis-will-sui-top-5-as-tvl-nears-2b/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=sui-price-analysis-will-sui-top-5-as-tvl-nears-2b,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png
42416285,c4d49658-3d40-45ab-aa1f-2c91bd87a231,1735038592,SOL's Evolving Throwback Pattern Makes It Enticing for Breakout Traders: Godbole,"In financial markets, the best entry opportunity is often fleeting and easily missed. Now, Solana's SOL is flashing a timely second chance for those looking to trade bullish breakouts.  The SOL price has surged over 7% this week to $193, rebounding off a former resistance-turned-support identified by the trendline connecting highs from March and July. This line, and the one joining April and August lows, define a large descending channel comprising prolonged range play from March to October.  The prices broke out of the channel in early November, confirming a bullish bias. SOL quickly climbed to over $260 before retracing to the breakout point last week.  The roundtrip is called a bullish ""throwback pattern"" by technical analysts.  ""Throwbacks occur when prices break out upward and then 'throw back' to their break out level. The retracement is an excellent level at which to participate in the upward trend,"" Charles D. Kirkpatrick II and Julie R. Dahlquist said in the third edition of ""Technical Analysis: The Complete Resource for Financial Market Technicians.""  ""They tend to be very short in time and distance but often provide a second, lesser-risk opportunity for a breakout trader to enter a position,"" the authors write.  Breakout traders seek securities that have struggled to surpass a specific level. When the price finally breaks through, these traders enter the market, anticipating substantial movement in the direction of the breakout.  Trading breakouts demands constant monitoring of the markets and careful assessment of price and volume trends. Traders who miss the initial breakout often look to enter on a successful throwback, like SOL's. These entries are generally perceived as low risk since the potential exit point or stop loss can be placed just below the breakout point.  The throwback seen above can be explained by behavioral aspects of trading, particularly prospect theory, which says that people are generally risk-averse when it comes to securing gains. In other words, when presented with potential profits, traders often book those gains rather than letting the winning trade run.  This tendency explains why the first post-breakout rally does not persist for long and prices usually fall back to the breakout point. It's because traders who jumped in with the breakout are quick to take profit on a subsequent move higher.  That's when it gets interesting. The traders who missed the first breakout may see the throwback as a second opportunity to get in. They go long at the breakout point, ensuring the support stays intact. This explains SOL's bounce from the key level.  If SOL continues to rise, those who took profits soon after the initial breakout might regret doing so and take fresh longs, further adding to the bullish momentum. That's how trends develop.  A similar throwback pattern played out perfectly in bitcoin (BTC) in the second half of 2023, setting the stage for a massive bull run.  Note that the bullish throwback pattern will be invalidated if the SOL's price bounce fizzles, allowing for a retrace back into the channel.",POSITIVE,BTC | SOL,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/12/24/sols-evolving-throwback-pattern-makes-it-enticing-for-breakout-traders-godbole,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/069b665a87a0a2c66cfe45efded0b8ddf0f7240c-1280x953.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
38045969,https://coinpedia.org/?p=397102,1735038529,Major Crypto Market Prediction 2025,"The post Major Crypto Market Prediction 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As 2024 comes to a close, the cryptocurrency world has experienced a year full of milestones. Bitcoin surged past $100,000, Ethereum saw its ETF launch, and stablecoins further solidified their role in global finance. In addition to this Donald Trump-sized U.S. presidential victory and SEC‚Äôs chair Gary Gensler to resign soon. As we are very close to stepping into 2025, the crypto world is set for even more changes. Here are seven things to expect next year. 1) Countries Will Establish Bitcoin Reserves One of the boldest predictions is that a major G7 or BRICS nation will create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . Inspired by ideas from previous U.S. political campaigns, this could see countries diversifying their reserves to include Bitcoin. Such a move would elevate Bitcoin‚Äôs role on the global stage and reshape international financial strategies. 2) Stablecoins Will Double in Value Stablecoins, which offer stability and easy cross-border transactions, are expected to continue their growth in 2025. With an expected market cap exceeding $400 billion, the introduction of stablecoin-specific regulations in the U.S. will likely accelerate their adoption, strengthening the U.S. dollar‚Äôs global dominance even further. 3) Bitcoin Will Be Used For DeFi Bitcoin is no longer just for holding its value. Thanks to new Layer 2 networks like Stacks, Bitcoin will be used more in decentralized finance (DeFi). Platforms like Stacks and CoreDAO are making Bitcoin more usable for DeFi activities like lending and staking. By 2025, these L2 solutions could greatly expand Bitcoin‚Äôs role in decentralized finance. 4) More Crypto ETFs Will Appear After the success of Bitcoin ETFs in 2024, 2025 will see even more crypto ETFs. Ethereum ETFs might allow people to earn rewards by staking Ethereum. We may also see ETFs for other big cryptocurrencies like Solana, XRP, and Cardano, which will give investors more ways to invest in crypto. 5) Corporate To Add Bitcoin to Their Balance Sheets In 2025, some of the world‚Äôs biggest companies , like Apple or Amazon, might add Bitcoin to their balance sheet. New accounting rules will make it easier for companies to report their Bitcoin holdings, encouraging them to add Bitcoin to their balance sheets as a way to protect their money. 6) Crypto Market Cap Will Surpass $8 Trillion The total cryptocurrency market cap, which reached $3.8 trillion in 2024, is expected to hit $8 trillion by 2025. More people will start using blockchain technology, and new apps and services will be built on crypto. This will keep pushing the market higher. 7) U.S. Will Lead Crypto Leader Again With a new, pro-crypto leadership taking over the SEC, the U.S. will likely return as a global crypto powerhouse. Regulatory clarity and improved access to banking infrastructure will create an environment where U.S.-based crypto startups can flourish. This will make the U.S. a key player in the global crypto market.",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,ADA | BTC | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/seven-major-predictions-for-crypto-in-2025-bitcoin-stablecoins-and-more/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png
38045946,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=375842,1735038508,Aave Sees Consistent Year-Long Uptrend in These Metrics as AAVE Price Rockets,"The native token of DeFi platform Aave (AAVE) has achieved its highest price in three years this month. The price has sustained a minor pullback aligning with the broader market correction over the weekend but continues to hover close to the recently established multi-year high of $394. Several factors at play have potentially catalyzed this milestone. New data suggest AAVE‚Äôs price trajectory is underpinned by strong on-chain metrics and platform performance. Aave‚Äôs Steady Growth According to the latest analysis by DefiLlama, there has been a consistent year-long uptrend in Total Value Locked (TVL), token price, and fees. Aave‚Äôs TVL has undergone a parabolic surge this year after laying flat for most of 2023.¬†It has risen from $6.62 billion in January to a new all-time high of $23.1 billion in December. Meanwhile, Aave‚Äôs fees have shown consistent growth over the past year, although at a smaller scale compared to its TVL and token price increases, suggesting increased usage and demand for the decentralized crypto lending platform. Santiment‚Äôs recent analysis revealed that AAVE‚Äôs rise is linked to a sharp decrease in the ‚ÄúMean Dollar Invested Age,‚Äù an indicator showing the increased movement of dormant tokens by major stakeholders. This reactivation of inactive or dormant coins has been instrumental in boosting bullish trends. Additionally, the active traders have reaped significant profits as a result, with 30-day returns surpassing 96% and annual gains reaching over 290%. Last week, it achieved an impressive milestone with $38 billion in deposits, attracting significant whale interest, particularly from the Trump World Liberty wallet. Additionally, Aave‚Äôs social volume is also on the rise, reinforcing its status as a leading DeFi player. Room for Growth While the strong bullish momentum was met with a price pullback due to heightened market sentiment, experts currently suggest that AAVE has shown relative strength over altcoins this month, indicating that there‚Äôs more room for growth. Another crypto trader has shared an optimistic outlook for AAVE by highlighting its relative strength compared to the broader market. Despite recent market fluctuations, the analyst notes that the token is showing signs of attempting a breakout.

The submission shows that the Trust offered 3,565,200 shares, equalling 304,034 ZEN tokens ($4.7 million), in a private offering to accredited investors. Form 8-K is mandatory filing for companies. It is supposed to make the public aware of a company‚Äôs significant events in real time. The Grayscale filing will inform existing investors and anyone looking to invest in critical developments within the Horizen Trust in compliance with SEC laws. The news of this filing has born early dividends as it has led to the token price jumping by 30%. Horizen Trust offers a safe vehicle to capitalize on the blockchain The Grayscale Horizen Trust gives qualified investors a safer, regulated, and cost-effective method to access Horizen‚Äôs blockchain platform, ZEN tokens. Horizen was introduced as a private-centric blockchain that is scalable and can accommodate an active set of different decentralized applications. Horizon Trust offers a safe, compliant means for individuals eager to capitalize on the blockchain‚Äôs potential. The Grayscale Horizen Trust periodically issues shares. Depending on the circumstances, they have the leeway to suspend, stop, or even discontinue the launch of shares at any time. Suspensions can occur during disruptions in the crypto network, such as airdrops or a fork. The ability to suspend the issuance of shares is an operational safeguard to balance risks and offer a stable means for investors to access ZEN‚Äôs value. Horizen offers shares of trusts in baskets of 100 shares. To acquire shares, investors deposit an amount of ZEN equal to 100 times the number of ZEN represented by a single share at the time of creation to create a basket. Grayscale has deliberated on expanding and growing its portfolio. In 2024, it introduced three more trusts, including Sky, formerly MakerDAO, Bittensor, and Sui protocol-native token-focused trusts. As of today, December 2024, the Grayscale Horizen Trust traded at $5.30 per share for its close to $28.4 million assets under management (AUM). This Trust adds to Grayscale‚Äôs box of regulated crypto investment products. It also has flagship projects, like the Bitcoin and Ethereum trusts, GBTC, and ETHE.

38047014,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53008,1735038041,BlockDAG‚Äôs Market Surge Expected as Inter Milan Deal Goes Live ‚Äì Toncoin & Sui Pursue ATHs,"Have you caught the latest on Toncoin? The token is making a comeback with a 15% price increase following a turbulent week, buoyed by robust community support. Meanwhile, Sui is also making headlines with a 500% surge this year, thanks to its expanding presence in gaming and decentralized finance (DeFi). Both projects are making waves, yet their long-term profitability remains under scrutiny. Here‚Äôs where BlockDAG really shines. Armed with cutting-edge blockchain technology and a booming presale that‚Äôs already amassed nearly $172 million, BlockDAG is positioning itself as a frontrunner in the cryptocurrency space. The recent activation of its partnership with Inter Milan is set to enhance its visibility globally, leveraging San Siro Stadium for branding and engaging fans digitally. These strategic moves are expected to significantly drive up demand for BDAG coins, offering substantial benefits to early adopters. BlockDAG Aims for a Surge as Inter Milan Partnership Kicks Off With the roll-out of its Inter Milan partnership, BlockDAG is unveiling unprecedented opportunities for BDAG buyers. This alliance brings BlockDAG‚Äôs brand directly to millions through high-visibility channels like San Siro‚Äôs LED displays, stadium screens, and digital promotions. Initiatives such as blockchain-enabled ticketing and merchandise are anticipated to boost adoption, ensuring a steady demand for BDAG coins. This high-profile collaboration not only boosts BDAG‚Äôs visibility but also secures its position as a highly desirable asset in the crypto market. BlockDAG‚Äôs presale has already achieved remarkable success, with over $172 million raised and more than 17.5 billion BDAG tokens sold across various batches. Currently priced at $0.0234 per token, early adopters are securing potentially lucrative returns. The presale‚Äôs structured bonuses, like the BDAG400 offer, provide additional incentives, setting the stage for substantial gains ahead of the full market launch. Yet, the core appeal of BDAG lies in its unique technological foundation. By integrating blockchain with Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology, BlockDAG delivers exceptional speed and scalability, ideal for applications like DeFi and high-frequency trading. This innovative approach not only ensures BDAG‚Äôs long-term utility but also distinguishes it from other assets. With its high-demand presale, groundbreaking technology, and the global reach provided by the Inter Milan deal, BlockDAG is orchestrating a perfect scenario for sustained growth. BDAG buyers are positioned to benefit from both immediate demand spikes and long-term value increases, making this project a standout for sustained profitability. Latest Toncoin Update: Community Engagement & Price Revival The recent update on Toncoin shows a promising 15% recovery, boosting its price to $5.52 after recent dips. This rebound aligns with a spike in community engagement, with Toncoin dominating December 2024‚Äôs social activity charts. Its integration with Telegram enhances its adoption in messaging and DeFi applications, bolstering its practical utility. Toncoin‚Äôs growth in user addresses, now over 128 million, highlights its potential. However, the market remains volatile, and its long-term profitability depends on continuous adoption. For those looking to maximize returns, while Toncoin offers immediate momentum, exploring other assets like BlockDAG, which boast broader ecosystems and advanced scalability, might present more stable long-term opportunities. Sui‚Äôs Record High Fuels Optimism for Blockchain Gaming Sui‚Äôs recent all-time high of $4.93 has turned heads, driven by its significant role in gaming and DeFi, particularly through its partnership with the blockbuster MOBA game, E4C: Final Salvation. This 500% price jump this year underscores growing developer and user interest, reinforcing Sui‚Äôs position as a blockchain designed for scalability and innovation. Despite its successes, Sui faces hurdles in maintaining its momentum, including concerns over insider token sales. However, the Sui Foundation‚Äôs transparent handling of these issues has helped maintain community trust. With upcoming AI enhancements aimed at bolstering security and efficiency, Sui is laying the groundwork for sustained utility. Yet, for investors seeking reliable returns, continued adoption across diverse sectors will be crucial to support its valuation. The Final Thought While Polkadot‚Äôs upgrades and SUI‚Äôs recent high point to their expanding roles in blockchain innovation, uncertainties about their long-term profitability linger. Toncoin‚Äôs recent market dynamics echo this, as projects compete for traction in DeFi and gaming. However, BlockDAG differentiates itself with a unique advantage. Its Inter Milan partnership not only expands global brand recognition through San Siro engagements but also directly stimulates demand for BDAG coins. Coupled with a record-setting presale nearing $172 million, BlockDAG is carving out a niche among top crypto projects, promising both immediate returns and prolonged growth potential.

38045936,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=631368,1735038000,Cryptos with Strong Developer Activity Indicating Future Growth Projects to Watch,"In the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency landscape, the level of developer activity within a project often serves as a key indicator of its potential for future growth. A vibrant and engaged developer community typically correlates with continuous innovation, timely updates, and the resolution of technical challenges, all of which are essential for a cryptocurrency‚Äôs long-term success.

Currently in its presale at just $0.003 , it presents an exciting investment opportunity for those looking to enter the AI and blockchain space at an early stage. Polkadot One more plan with big builder work pushing its rise is Polkadot, a new kind of chain rule made to link many special chains into a bigger and working network. Made by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood, Polkadot‚Äôs strange build lets for cross-chain talk, letting apps and things to go smoothly between different chains. Since it‚Äôs main net start in 2020, Polkadot has seen fast growth, with big partnerships and links with leading plans like Chainlink and Kusama. Its ongoing work includes the soon start of parachains (side chains) and the use of smart features like staking and governance. With a current market capÕè of more than $30 billion, Polkadot is putting itself as a top player in the block chain space for year to come. Solana Solana is a high-performance blockchain platform that uses a unique Proof of History (PoH) consensus mechanism to achieve lightning-fast transaction speeds and low fees. This scalable infrastructure has attracted significant attention from developers, with notable projects like Serum, Raydium, and Mango Markets building on top of the Solana ecosystem. In addition to its strong developer activity, Solana‚Äôs recent partnerships with major players like Tether and Chainlink have further solidified its position as a leading blockchain project. With an ambitious roadmap that includes the launch of its decentralized exchange (DEX) and stablecoin platform, Solana is poised for significant growth in the coming years. Which One to Watch? While all three projects show strong potential for future growth, Lightchain AI stands out with its unique combination of AI and blockchain technology. Its ongoing presale is another factor to consider, offering early investors the opportunity to be a part of this innovative project at a discounted price. With its impressive development progress and promising roadmap, Lightchain AI is certainly one to watch in the coming years. And with the growing importance of AI and its potential to disrupt various industries, investing in Lightchain AI at an early stage could prove to be a wise decision.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) started as a joke, much like Dogecoin. But it‚Äôs quickly becoming more than just a meme. Launched in August 2020 by someone known only as Ryoshi, SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain. This means it can work with many apps and systems already using Ethereum. What‚Äôs interesting is that Ryoshi sent half of all SHIB tokens to Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum. This move built trust. Buterin then donated a big chunk to help with COVID-19 relief in India and ‚Äúburned‚Äù 40% of the tokens, reducing supply and raising SHIB‚Äôs profile. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB‚Äôs connection with Ethereum allows for more possibilities. There‚Äôs ShibaSwap, a place to trade tokens without a central authority. Plans are also in the works for a platform for NFTs (digital art) and a system where SHIB holders can have a say in decisions. This could make SHIB more useful. In the current market, while many coins are struggling, SHIB‚Äôs developments could make it stand out. Its potential for real-world use, not just as a joke, might attract more attention. As the crypto world evolves, SHIB could be a coin to watch. Pepe (PEPE) PEPE is a new player in the cryptocurrency world, inspired by the famous Pepe the Frog meme created by Matt Furie. Launched on Ethereum as a deflationary memecoin, it aims to join the ranks of popular meme-based cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. PEPE appeals to crypto enthusiasts with its no-tax policy and straightforward approach‚Äîembracing its meme roots without pretense of utility. In late April to May 2023, PEPE saw an explosive surge, with its market cap reaching a peak of $1.6 billion. Early investors became millionaires overnight, and a strong community rallied behind the coin. This phenomenon sparked what some call a ‚Äúmemecoin season,‚Äù with other meme tokens experiencing wild rides. PEPE‚Äôs roadmap is ambitious, aiming for more exchange listings and a ‚Äúmeme takeover.‚Äù While it lacks traditional utility, its viral nature and community support make it an interesting prospect. As the crypto market looks ahead to the next Bitcoin halving and a potential bull run, PEPE stands out as a coin that could ride the wave of meme-powered popularity. Conclusion While Shiba Inu and PEPE thrive, XYZVerse outshines by merging meme culture with sports, targeting 20,000% growth, and creating a community-driven ecosystem poised to become the G.O.A.T of memecoins.

38059372,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=106286,1735037696,US IRS Insists to Tax Unrealized Profit from Crypto Staking,"The US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) maintains that profits from crypto staking are taxable even before the participant cashes in on them. The governmental parastatal has reiterated that crypto staking does not constitute a new property. As a result, crypto enthusiasts staking their assets should account fully for them and pay taxes upon staking.A Bloomberg report on Tuesday stated the IRS‚Äôs stance in an ongoing legal proceeding between the agency and a US couple. For context, Joshua Jarret and his wife, Jessica Jarret, filed a lawsuit against the tax collectors in October, seeking to reform how the IRS views taxes on crypto staking.Background of the IRS Tax CaseThe years-long legal battle originated from an initial lawsuit against the IRS over a tax feud. The couple argued against the agency's stance on staking taxes and insisted that, like a farmer‚Äôs proceeds are only accounted for after harvest, rewards for staked cryptocurrencies should be taxable after the sales.Notably, the IRS repaid the couple‚Äôs overdraft tax of $4,000 for its 8,876 Tezos (XTZ) earnings in 2019. However, they pursue a greater course, seeking to establish a legal framework treating staked cryptocurrencies as new properties.Although the court closed the case on the premise that Joshua and Jessica had received a refund, the couple filed a fresh lawsuit on the case two months ago. They asked for a refund of the $12,179 paid in tax for its 13,000 XTZ earnings.Meanwhile, the IRS has maintained that crypto stakers should pay liability tax upon locking up their assets. The tax collectors cited the Revenue Ruling 202314 bill, which supports a tax imposition on staked assets as soon as their owners can sell, exchange, or dispose of them.Revolving View of CryptocurrencyNotably, views on cryptocurrency and its activities are evolving amidst a friendly global stance. In opposition to the IRS‚Äôs view that crypto is not property, legal entities in some other countries have started adopting digital assets as a prominent financial tool.For context, an English High Court recognized Tether as property. The presiding judge noted that the stablecoin has all the qualities of a property, including tangibility, traceability, and usage.Russia‚Äôs President, Vladimir Putin, recently signed a similar treaty on digital assets. He also approved a bill recognizing cryptocurrencies as property and exempting them from value-added tax.Meanwhile, cryptocurrencies continue to gain global traction. The sector‚Äôs firstborn, Bitcoin, has become the subject of a broader adoption among countries as a strategic reserve asset.",NEGATIVE,XTZ,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | XTZ,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/24/us-irs-insists-to-tax-unrealized-profit-from-crypto-staking/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=us-irs-insists-to-tax-unrealized-profit-from-crypto-staking,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

In a recent interview , CEO Vladimir Tenev said that while the idea occasionally surfaces, the company remains focused on its core business of facilitating trading rather than holding Bitcoin for investment purposes. ‚ÄúWe wouldn‚Äôt rule it out, but we haven‚Äôt done it thus far,‚Äù Tenev remarked during an interview with Anthony Pompliano. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not in the business of being an investment manager.‚Äù Robinhood‚Äôs Stock Already Mirrors Bitcoin Performance Tenev acknowledged that Robinhood‚Äôs stock already closely mirrors Bitcoin‚Äôs performance, without the company needing to hold the cryptocurrency in its treasury. Robinhood shares have surged 202% this year, outpacing Bitcoin‚Äôs 110% year-to-date gain. However, Tenev noted that adding Bitcoin to the company‚Äôs balance sheet might confuse investors and lead to Robinhood being perceived as a ‚Äúquasi-Bitcoin-holding play.‚Äù Despite its cautious approach to direct crypto investments, Robinhood continues to expand its crypto offerings. The company has fewer listed digital assets compared to competitors like Coinbase and Kraken, but this conservative strategy is expected to evolve. Analysts at Bernstein recently identified Robinhood as the leading ‚Äúcrypto deregulation trade‚Äù in the current market cycle, predicting a 20% increase in the platform‚Äôs crypto revenues by 2025, potentially accounting for 38% of total revenues. Further solidifying its crypto ambitions, Robinhood plans to finalize its acquisition of crypto exchange Bitstamp by mid-2025. More recently, the firm announced a $300 million acquisition of TradePMR to expand its wealth management services. According to a statement from the company, the acquisition is expected to close in the first half of 2025 and will be part of Robinhood‚Äôs strategy to cater to evolving customer needs in wealth management. In October, Robinhood also announced its plans to support Bitcoin and Ether futures, alongside traditional commodities like oil and the S&P 500, as part of a larger rollout of derivatives products. The development came after the crypto trading platform‚Äôs reported plans to list crypto futures in the U.S. and Europe . Corporate Investors Increase Bitcoin Holdings Robinhood‚Äôs decision to stay away from Bitcoin investment comes despite growing confidence in the leading cryptocurrency among corporate investors. On Monday, MicroStrategy added another 5,262 BTC to its reserves, spending $561 million at an average price of $106,662 per Bitcoin. The latest purchase brings the company‚Äôs total holdings to an impressive 444,262 BTC, accumulated at an average cost of $62,257 per Bitcoin. On the same day, Japanese investment firm Metaplanet made its largest Bitcoin purchase to date, acquiring nearly 620 BTC. On December 23, the company announced the $60 million acquisition of 619.7 BTC at an average price of approximately $96,000 per coin, nearly quadrupling its previous record buy of 159.7 BTC in October. Likewise, MARA Holdings (MARA) bought 11,774 BTC in the latest acquisition, the company announced on X on Dec. 10.

Musk the Manipulator (MUSKMANI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKMANI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk the Manipulator can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk the Manipulator could become the next viral memecoin. Musk the Manipulator launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk the Manipulator on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk the Manipulator by entering its contract address ‚Äì DZpfk5LaLrnP6vSFJnLSMAopUuTJGiFk7543rQxh4ids ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKMANI.

The attackers are being tracked as ‚ÄúTraderTraitor‚Äù who initiated the attack by posing as a recruiter on LinkedIn. The investigation is conducted by the FBI with the National Police Agency of Japan and the US Department of Defense. DMM Bitcoin has already announced that it will go out of business after adjourning some of its services after the major theft. However, the crypto industry lost around $1.5 billion to hackers in 2024. This is a drop of 17% from last year. The hack of $235 million from India‚Äôs WazirX is one of the big hits in the list. From LinkedIn to $308M theft According to the report , the $308 million Bitcoin breach originated at Ginco, a crypto wallet company. A TraderTraitor attacker posed as a LinkedIn recruiter, sending out a malicious Python script to an employee as part of a ‚Äúpre-employment test.‚Äù Once the script was executed, the hackers technically gained unauthorized access to Ginco‚Äôs systems. It was by mid-May that they exploited session cookies to impersonate the compromised employee. This helped them to infiltrate Ginco‚Äôs communications network. It added that by late May, TraderTraitor hackers manipulated a transaction that was requested by a DMM employee. This is how they successfully exfiltrated 4,502.9 Bitcoin (approx. worth $308 million). After this, the funds were moved to wallets controlled by the group. Bitcoin price recorded a major correction lately. BTC price dropped straight to the $94,000 level from over $100,000. It is now down by 12.5% in the last 7 days. Bitcoin is trading at an average price of $94,321, at press time. Its 24-hour trading volume is up by 14% to stand at $57 billion. FBI, Japan busting scams Japan‚Äôs Financial Services Agency has already ordered the exchange to improve its operations in September citing the risk management structure. Reports suggest that no users suffered financial damage as the exchange managed to get 55 billion yen (approx. worth $350 million) from a group firm to cover the lost assets. The FBI , Japan‚Äôs NPA, and the DoD Cyber Crime Center are coordinating efforts to counter North Korea‚Äôs illicit activities, which use cybercrime to fund its regime, it added. The FBI report noted that such operations are also known as Jade Sleet and Slow Pisces. These activities highlight the risks of targeted social engineering. It mentioned that in such cases TraderTraitor frequently directs simultaneous attacks at multiple employees within organizations. The crypto sector faced $1.49 billion in losses due to hacks and fraud in 2024, a 17% drop from 2023. Hacks accounted for $1.47 billion, with fraud representing just $28 million. Key incidents included DMM Bitcoin‚Äôs $305M breach and WazirX ‚Äòs $235M hack, which together made up 36% of total losses.

These are different Memecoins and DeFi tokens, enriching the categories of assets on the platform and giving global users more investment opportunities. UFD's Surge, PENGU on Hot List with $1.8B Market Cap UFD , or Unicorn Fart Dust, is a meme coin in the Solana ecosystem that has been growing with the tag of a ""social experiment."" A 54-year-old gold and silver trader was inspired to create his own meme token, UFD, based on Fartcoin, which had a market cap of $500 million. The creation of UFD symbolizes the innovative trend of the cryptocurrency market as well as the openness of the industry towards investors cutting across all age groups. From GMGN data, on December 19th, UFD market cap has already passed $230 million , the 24-hour price increase was at 434%, and a 24-hour trading volume of $145.4 million. According to Onchain Lens, one address that bought UFD early on changed $700 into $1.8 million in less than 7 hours. According to Lookonchain, a trader bought 12.98 million UFD tokens for 0.4 SOL two days ago. During the price spike, the trader sold over 80,000 UFD tokens twice, netting $4,500 while holding 12.9 million tokens in their account. PENGU is the official token created by the Pudgy Penguins project, which contains 8,888 unique cartoon penguin NFTs. Each NFT generates randomly assigned qualities through the use of up to 150 hand-drawn components. These penguins have up to five different features, such as distinctive backgrounds, body shapes, clothes, and accessories. PENGU is launched on the Solana blockchain in December 2024 with a total of 88,888,888,888 tokens. The overall market cap has crossed $1.88 billion, and the 24-hour trading volume is $360 million, with 62.86 billion tokens in circulation. The project intends to propel Web3 innovation through the Abstract public blockchain and developer incubator, and it has the support of the robust NFT community of Pudgy Penguins. Abstract recently raised $11 million, majorly coming from Peter Thiel's Founders Fund, and hence offers a lot of support towards developing the PENGU ecosystem. On-Chain Speed and Stable Ecosystem: Dual Innovations of HYPE and USUAL HYPE is the native token of the decentralized derivatives protocol Hyperliquid and is the core asset of the high-performance L1 platform. With a latency of less than one second and complete transparency in its order book, trading, and settlement, Hyperliquid focuses on totally on-chain operations. The Hyperliquid platform is a rising leader in the DeFi industry, with a total asset value of $2.173 billion, according to DefiLlama data. HYPE's price has increased in 1345% since it was launched from $2 to $28.91. The 24-hour trade volume for HYPE has now surpassed $15 billion, according to data by @HyperliquidX , which marks a new record. USUAL is the native governance token of the Usual protocol. It aims to create a secure and efficient stablecoin ecosystem backed by real-world assets, or RWA. Among its core functions are: Governance: Transparency in decentralized governance and community leadership is ensured by allowing holders to take part in crucial protocol decisions like earnings distribution and collateral management. Yield: The users can benefit from the RWA investments of the protocol with yields on US Treasury bonds by staking USUAL. Stablecoin Ecosystem: supports the main products of the protocol, being USD0, a stablecoin, which RWA supports and USD0++, a variant of liquid staking, and holders can share revenue via management or staking. It also ties the issuance of USUAL tokens to total value locked, where increases in TVL reduce the token supply, thus constituting a deflationary mechanism that can boost long-term value. As of December 18, USD0 minting was seen reaching a record-breaking 190 million units with the total supply rising beyond 1 billion units netting 136 million units. It can be established that the high level of capital attraction of the Usual procedure is by reaching the Treasury revenue of $5.89 million. The increase of USD0 and USD0++ will enhance TVL by raising USUAL's scarcity and value appreciation. At the moment of writing, the token's price is $1.39, up 34.2% over the previous day. At $838,695,117, the trade volume is more than it has been in the past. Meanwhile, BYDFi has simultaneously launched additional tokens, including FUEL , VANA , SEND , and ARCSOL .

This decline marked the beginning of a recovery that lasted over 912 days. Tesla‚Äôs initial rebound saw it surpass its previous high of $24, reaching $58 in April 2020. The rally accelerated in the subsequent months, with Tesla achieving $170 later that year. By November 2021, Tesla peaked at $410, marking a dramatic shift from its earlier struggles. XRP‚Äôs Market Dynamics EGRAG compares Tesla‚Äôs price action and XRP‚Äôs current market position. XRP recently experienced a notable drop following Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse‚Äôs appearance on 60 Minutes in December 2024. After trading at a peak of $2.90 on December 3, XRP has since declined, reaching its current price of $2.22 after a slight 1.97% gain. This downward trend has been exacerbated by hawkish commentary from the Federal Reserve, leaving XRP approximately 20% below its December high. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Technical analysis reveals a critical support level at $2.1244, which could aid the digital asset‚Äôs recovery. However, EGRAG predicts a steeper correction may occur before the expected rally, with prices possibly dropping as low as $1.20. XRP Path to $41 Despite the anticipated short-term decline, EGRAG maintains a bullish long-term outlook for XRP. He projects that after reaching a low of $1.20, XRP could rebound to $2.40 before surging to $5.60, marking a new all-time high. Following this breakout, the asset is expected to rally further, reaching $17 and ultimately hitting the $41 target within the 91-day timeframe. EGRAG attributes the faster timeline to the accelerated pace of the cryptocurrency market compared to traditional stocks. EGRAG‚Äôs analysis provides a bold projection for XRP‚Äôs price performance, drawing on historical data from Tesla‚Äôs meteoric rise. While the short-term outlook suggests further corrections, the potential for a significant recovery remains high. If XRP achieves the anticipated 1,667% increase, it would mark a historic rally for the digital asset, setting new benchmarks for its future performance.

This stance has been reiterated in the ongoing legal dispute involving Joshua and Jessica Jarrett, who argue for a different tax treatment for staking rewards. The IRS issued a statement on December 23, stating that taxpayers must report staking rewards as income at their fair market value as soon as they are able to sell or exchange them. According to IRS Revenue Ruling 2023-14, these rewards are not viewed as newly created property but as income, similar to wages or dividends. Staking, a process where cryptocurrency holders lock their assets in a smart contract to support blockchain operations, generates rewards in the form of additional tokens. While it has become a popular method for earning passive income in the crypto space, its tax implications have sparked major debate. Jarretts Challenge IRS in Second Lawsuit The Jarretts‚Äô legal battle with the IRS began in 2021 when they filed a lawsuit over taxes paid on 8,876 Tezos (XTZ) tokens earned as staking rewards in 2019. The couple argued that these rewards should be treated as property, akin to crops harvested by a farmer or a manuscript written by an author, and taxed only upon sale. The IRS initially offered the Jarretts a $4,000 refund to resolve the dispute, but they declined, seeking to establish a broader precedent for proof-of-stake networks. The court ultimately dismissed the case, deeming it moot due to the refund. In October 2024, the Jarretts renewed their challenge with a second lawsuit, now seeking a $12,179 refund for taxes paid on 13,000 XTZ tokens earned in 2020. Their filing requests a permanent injunction against the IRS‚Äôs current tax policy , arguing that ‚Äúnew property‚Äù is not taxable income until sold. Potential Ripple Effects for Crypto Taxation This legal battle could have far-reaching implications for the cryptocurrency industry, especially for proof-of-stake networks. If the court rules in favor of the Jarretts, it could reshape how staking rewards are classified and taxed, potentially easing the burden on crypto investors. As the case unfolds, the IRS‚Äôs firm stance underscores its commitment to treating staking rewards as immediate taxable income, a position that will likely continue to stir debate across the industry.

Once again, the crypto market is brimming with new opportunities, and presales are emerging as the gateway to substantial rewards. Projects like 5th Scape, Doge¬≤, Jetbolt, and BlockDAG are grabbing attention with their innovative solutions and bold visions. These presales offer investors the opportunity to secure tokens at early-stage prices, often paving the way for substantial returns. From revolutionary VR gaming platforms to AI-powered trading tools and advanced blockchain technologies, these projects are shaping the future of the crypto market. So, let‚Äôs explore what makes these presales stand out and why they‚Äôre worth considering. 1. BlockDAG Network Hits $171 Million In Presale BlockDAG‚Äôs unique use of Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology combined with Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus is setting a new standard in blockchain scalability and decentralization. This architecture eliminates traditional bottlenecks, enabling faster transactions, robust security, and a truly decentralized framework. With over $171 million raised in just a few months, BlockDAG‚Äôs presale is a phenomenon, paving the way to hit its $600 million target. Across just 26 presale batches, early BDAG holders have already seen a 2240% ROI as the BDAG price surged from $0.001 to $0.0234. Its most recent AMA highlighted the impressive achievements from 2024, including record-breaking presale milestones, launching the Alpha Testnet with 100 nodes, and completing Phase 1 development of its DAG-based blockchain core. The team highlighted plans for a 2025 mainnet launch, prioritizing technological enhancements and market alignment. With its revolutionary technology, record-breaking presale, and upcoming mainnet launch, BlockDAG (BDAG) emerges as the ideal choice for crypto holders seeking top crypto presales for the next crypto bull run. 2. 5th Scape: VR and AR Innovation 5th Scape introduces a VR/AR platform blending immersive gaming with blockchain technology on the Ethereum network. Its flagship games, such as ‚ÄòCage Conquest‚Äô and ‚ÄòArchery Master‚Äô, show its focus on creating interactive virtual experiences. Additionally, its developer marketplace offers tools for creators to monetize custom add-ons and content. With its presale raising over $8.43 million, 5th Scape targets gaming enthusiasts looking for innovation. While it explores niche gaming opportunities, its appeal is centered on a specific audience rather than broader blockchain advancements. For those tracking the top crypto presale, 5th Scape highlights the growing intersection of VR and blockchain. 3. Doge¬≤: Layer 2 for Faster DeFi Doge¬≤ expands on Dogecoin by introducing a Layer 2 solution to enhance transaction speed and reduce costs. By leveraging Ethereum during its initial phase, the project incorporates features like staking and lending to offer additional functionality in decentralized finance (DeFi). It has so far raised over 602.37K in its presale funds. Its transition to Dogecoin‚Äôs Layer 2 network aims to strengthen its scalability. However, its focus remains on improving Dogecoin‚Äôs ecosystem rather than pioneering new blockchain innovations. Investors interested in the top crypto presale may see Doge¬≤ as a community-focused initiative, though with limited appeal beyond its foundational niche. 4. Jetbolt: Streamlined Microtransactions Solution Jetbolt focuses on enabling fast, cost-efficient microtransactions tailored for e-commerce and digital merchants. Its emphasis on seamless integration offers secure and scalable payment processing solutions. Designed for businesses requiring low transaction costs, Jetbolt caters to a niche audience in the payments sector. Currently, in its presale stages, Jetbolt has raised over 1.96 million. While it targets specific applications, its scope remains narrower compared to projects that address a variety of blockchain challenges. Those exploring the top crypto presale may consider Jetbolt‚Äôs targeted approach, though it primarily appeals to industries needing specialized transaction support. Top Crypto Presales to Buy Now The crypto market is filled with innovative projects like 5th Scape‚Äôs VR integration, Doge¬≤‚Äôs focus on Layer 2 scalability, and Jetbolt‚Äôs streamlined payment solutions. Each presents unique strengths within its niche. However, BlockDAG stands out as a comprehensive blockchain solution, offering cutting-edge DAG technology, a record-breaking presale, and plans for a mainnet launch in 2025. For investors exploring the top crypto presale , BlockDAG emerges as the ideal choice for long-term growth and innovation.

38044931,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=632660,1735036012,Kaspersky: Top scammers target digital thieves with fake crypto wallet keys to steal funds,"Cybersecurity firm Kaspersky has uncovered a unique scam targeting crypto thieves. The scheme lures would-be opportunists with seemingly loaded crypto wallets, only to siphon their funds when they attempt to access the bait. This inventive ploy demonstrates the growing sophistication of cybercriminals in the digital asset space. According to Kaspersky, top scammers are posing as na√Øve crypto users by publicly sharing seed phrases, the keys required to access crypto wallets, in YouTube comments. These comments, posted by newly created accounts, often include a plea for assistance in transferring funds from a wallet supposedly holding significant assets. ‚ÄúScammers have invented a new trick‚Ä¶They post crypto wallet seed phrases in YouTube comments using newly created accounts,‚Äù Kaspersky analyst Mikhail Sytnik detailed in a recent blog post . There‚Äôs no honor among thieves ‚Äì How the private key scam works One wallet observed by Kaspersky contained approximately $8,000 in USDT on the Tron network. To access these funds, a thief would first need to send TRX, the blockchain‚Äôs native token, to cover network fees. Scam trades: Source ‚Äì Tron Network The scheme primarily preys on individuals looking to exploit the supposedly ‚Äúfoolish‚Äù mistake of others. Once inside the bait wallet, these digital thieves find it filled with USDT, a TRC20 token tied to the US dollar. Since the wallet lacks sufficient TRX for withdrawals, they are prompted to send funds from their own wallets. This action triggers the ‚Äúsiphon,‚Äù diverting the TRX to the scammer‚Äôs address. Scam trades: Source ‚Äì Tron Network The scammers have rigged the system, and as soon as the TRX is sent, it is immediately redirected to a separate wallet controlled by the attackers, leaving the thief empty-handed. Kaspersky‚Äôs analysis likened the scammers to digital Robin Hoods, targeting unethical actors in the crypto space. However, the ultimate victims remain those who let their greed outweigh their caution. The security company is urging crypto users to be cautious of the repeated use of identical seed phrases across multiple comments. This could be a well-planned and coordinated operation to steal their assets. Scamming campaigns targeting crypto users Kaspersky‚Äôs findings extend beyond seed phrase scams. In August, the company‚Äôs Global Emergency Response Team (GERT) has identified a larger fraud campaign aimed at Windows and macOS users worldwide. This operation employs polished fake websites to mimic legitimate services, such as crypto platforms, online role-playing games, and AI tools. These sophisticated imitations are designed to lure victims into sharing sensitive information or downloading malware. ‚ÄúThe correlation between different parts of this campaign and their shared infrastructure suggests a well-organized operation, possibly linked to a single actor or group with specific financial motives,‚Äù stated Ayman Shaaban, Head of Incident Response at Kaspersky‚Äôs GERT. Dubbed ‚ÄúTusk,‚Äù Kaspersky‚Äôs investigation revealed that the campaign includes various sub-operations targeting crypto, gaming, and AI-related topics. The malicious infrastructure also extends to 16 other themes, either retired sub-campaigns or new ones yet to be launched. Strings of malicious code uncovered during the investigation showed communication between the attackers‚Äô servers in Russian, with references to the term ‚ÄúMammoth‚Äù (‚Äú–ú–∞–º–æ–Ω—Ç‚Äù), slang for ‚Äúvictim‚Äù among Russian-speaking threat actors. This linguistic clue contributed to the campaign‚Äôs name. The Tusk campaign employs info-stealer malware such as Danabot and Stealc, as well as clipboard-monitoring clippers, some of which are open-source variants written in Go. Info-stealers extract credentials, wallet details, and other sensitive information, while clippers intercept cryptocurrency wallet addresses copied to clipboards, replacing them with malicious addresses controlled by the attackers.

38048288,https://cryptonews.com/?p=322258,1735035909,"Singapore Approved 13 Crypto Licenses This Year, While Hong Kong Lags Behind: Report","Singapore and Hong Kong have tried to attract crypto businesses this year; however, Singapore has led by approving 13 crypto licenses. According to a Bloomberg report , Singapore onboarded top crypto firms, including OKX , Upbit , and Anchorage, to its shores in 2024. The crypto license approval this year is more than double the licenses awarded last year, it added. However, the report added that Hong Kong has been more cautious in issuing licenses to crypto firms. As a result, Hong Kong has struggled to gain traction in the race to become a crypto hub. Further, Hong Kong authorities have been slower in handing out permits this year than expected. The nation currently has seven fully licensed crypto platforms , of which five were offered licenses this year. Meanwhile, major exchanges like OKX and Bybit have withdrawn their applications for Hong Kong licenses recently. Bloomberg‚Äôs findings align with an analysis by blockchain intelligence firm TRM Labs issued on Dec 12. Per TRM Labs, Singapore has more mature regulation this year due to the global nature of the crypto ecosystem. Angela Ang, senior policy adviser at TRM Labs, noted that Hong Kong‚Äôs regulatory regime for exchanges is more restrictive. The authorities have been more cautious regarding custody of customer assets and token listing and delisting policies. Furthermore, the city only allows trading in more liquid assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, restricting investors from trading other tokens. David Rogers, regional chief executive at market maker B2C2 Ltd, noted that China‚Äôs ban on crypto trading had shifted traders‚Äô focus to other jurisdictions like Hong Kong. The company has applied for a license in Singapore. Additionally, it is a ‚Äúsafe, long-term choice‚Äù for crypto businesses to choose Singapore due to its crypto-friendly atmosphere. ‚ÄúIt is a risk-adjusted approach we‚Äôre taking here,‚Äù Rogers added.

38044476,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=114146,1735035612,Bitcoin as a Strategic Reserve: The US Government‚Äôs Move in 2025,"The United States government‚Äôs decision to incorporate¬†Bitcoin¬†into its strategic reserves in 2025, was a turning point when it comes to policy. This move has sparked widespread discussions about Bitcoin‚Äôs potential as a strategic asset and its growing acceptance within institutional circles. Governments traditionally rely on gold and fiat currencies as reserves, but Bitcoin‚Äôs inclusion signals a new direction. Why Bitcoin as a Strategic Asset? Bitcoin ‚Äòs singular qualities make it a very attractive choice to hold in a strategic reserve. It has the added advantage of scarcity in its supply limit of just 21 million coins. Additionally, being decentralized in nature shields it from the ownership of any one individual, entity, or government ‚Äì a critically decisive element in its choice. Several advantages of Bitcoin as a reserve asset include: Portability: Bypassing conventional financial institutions, Bitcoin can be moved anywhere in the world in a matter of minutes. Security: By guaranteeing tamper-proof records, blockchain technology lowers the possibility of theft or forgery. Transparency: Public recording of transactions fosters accountability and confidence. Protect Yourself Against Inflation: Unlike fiat currencies , which may be issued in infinite amounts, Bitcoin has a fixed supply. These characteristics are promoting institutional adoption and enhancing Bitcoin‚Äôs ability to act as a hedge against unstable economies. Institutional Adoption Accelerates The fact that Bitcoin would even wind up in the US government‚Äôs reserves is the result of years of growing institutional adoption , in which businesses, hedge funds, and even small countries have come to accept it as a store of value. This has caused policymakers to reevaluate whether Bitcoin could be advantageous for their respective countries. In 2024, many major companies invested parts of their balance sheets in Bitcoin due to its potential long-term growth. This would lay the groundwork for governments to follow suit. By 2025, the US was not the first government to embrace Bitcoin reserves but certainly the largest, lending further credibility to the digital currency. US Bitcoin Policy and Regulation The US government‚Äôs move was accompanied by updates to Bitcoin regulation. Policymakers introduced clearer guidelines for institutional investors, reducing legal uncertainties that had previously deterred large-scale adoption. These regulations balanced the need to protect consumers while fostering innovation. Key aspects of the updated Bitcoin policy include: Policy Area Details Taxation Simplified rules for reporting Bitcoin holdings. Custody Guidelines for secure storage of Bitcoin. Anti-Money Laundering Strengthened measures to prevent illicit use. Cross-Border Trade Policies enabling smoother international transactions. These measures are intended to provide stability and encourage both private and public entities to adopt Bitcoin. Broader Implications The inclusion of Bitcoin into US reserves could have an influence on world finance for the next couple of decades. For one, this might encourage other nations, particularly those seeking to decrease their dependence on the US dollar, to act similarly. This would make for a more diversified and resilient international monetary system. This also strengthens Bitcoin‚Äôs position as a legitimate asset class. Many critics criticized Bitcoin, calling it speculative; the fact that it is finding its way into government reserves challenges that narrative. It also shows a change in how governments perceive technology‚Äôs role in shaping monetary systems. Challenges Ahead Despite its promise, Bitcoin‚Äôs role as a strategic reserve is not without challenges. Price volatility remains a concern, as sudden shifts in value could impact reserve stability. However, proponents argue that Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term upward trajectory offsets these risks. Another issue is energy consumption . Bitcoin mining has faced criticism for its environmental impact. Addressing this will likely require investment in sustainable energy sources and more efficient mining practices. Finally, maintaining global consensus on Bitcoin‚Äôs role in financial systems could prove difficult. Differing regulatory approaches across nations may hinder broader adoption. A New Era in Reserve Management An important turning point in financial history was reached in 2025 when the US government decided to accept Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. It shows that Bitcoin‚Äôs capacity to supplement conventional reserves and protect economic stability in a world that is changing quickly is becoming increasingly recognized. The broader institutional acceptance of digital assets also comes to the forefront in this shift. In an increasingly popular Bitcoin, a bigger role in global finance awaits it ‚Äì as an end to reshape how nations handle reserves and approach economic strategy. Whether this is the beginning of a larger trend is yet to be seen, but one thing is for sure: Bitcoin is no longer just an experiment in digital currency. It has earned its place among the assets that governments trust to secure their financial future.",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BTC | FIAT | MINING | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,Bitcoin World,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-as-a-strategic-reserve-the-us-governments-move-in-2025/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png

According to notice published on Dec. 24, Bitcoin Gold ( BTG ) will no longer be available for trading on the Upbit exchange starting from Jan. 23, 2025 at 14:30 KST. This means that all buy and sell orders requested after Jan. 23 will automatically be canceled by the exchange. Additionally, services related to BTG, including airdrops, wallet upgrades, and hard forks will no longer be supported by BTG. Since Dec. 10, the exchange has already tagged BTG as a virtual asset that is ‚Äúsubject to caution‚Äù due to its volatility in trade. Since then, the exchange has considered a range of aspects related to BTG, including the transparency of its operations, disclosure of important matters, practicality and sustainability of its business. However by Dec. 24, the crypto asset‚Äôs status remains unchanged. ‚ÄúUpbit determined that the reasons for designating Bitcoin Gold as a subject of caution have not been resolved, and decided to terminate trading support in accordance with the policy for designating digital assets as subject to caution and terminating trading support,‚Äù wrote the exchange.

38044356,https://crypto.news/?p=14321862,1735035400,India risks losing $2b in tax revenue as crypto traders shift to offshore platforms: report,"India could lose over $2 billion in tax revenue from cryptocurrency transactions over the next five years due to its tax policies driving traders to offshore platforms, according to a recent report. The December report from Indian technology think tank Esya Centre reveals that the government has already missed out on collecting over INR 6,000 (roughly $724 million) crore in tax revenue from virtual digital assets since July 2022 as traders migrated to offshore exchanges to avoid compliance burdens and high tax rates. After overturning a 2018 shadow ban, India levied a 30% capital gains tax on cryptocurrency transactions, which does not allow users to offset losses against gains, while also subjecting domestic crypto trades to a 1% Tax Deducted at Source. Additionally, the government has attempted to regulate the sector by bringing VDAs under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) and blocking URLs of non-compliant offshore exchanges to curb tax evasion and improve oversight. However, the report highlights that these measures have been largely ineffective, as traders continue to bypass restrictions using VPNs, and offshore platforms still dominate trading volumes. Notably, between July 2022 and November 2023, Indian users traded over INR 1.03 lakh crore (approximately $12.3 billion) worth of VDAs on offshore platforms, including blocked exchanges, with cumulative uncollected TDS estimated to exceed INR 3,493 crore (around $417 million) during this period. You might also like: India to recover $345m in taxes from Kraken, Huobi, and other offshore exchanges Between December 2023 and October 2024, trading volumes on offshore platforms surged further, INR 2.63 lakh crore (about $31.1 billion). This corresponds to an estimated INR 2,634 crore (approximately $311 million) in TDS owed by offshore platforms, bringing the total uncollected TDS since July 2022 to over INR 6,000 crore, the report stated. On the other hand, while domestic exchanges showed some improvement in early 2024, the overall trend indicated that locals continued to migrate to offshore platforms, with web traffic data indicating a 34% drop in user activity on major domestic platforms since the start of the year. Currently, KUcoin is the only Financial Intelligence Unit registered foreign exchange that began deducting TDS in March 2024 through a local entity. However, its contribution to overall offshore trading volumes by Indian users remains below 5%. If the current trend persists, the report warned that uncollected TDS from offshore crypto trading could surpass ‚Çπ17,700 crore (approximately $2.1 billion) over the next five years. India must revise tax policy ‚ÄúThe current regulatory framework disproportionately affects compliant users and entities while failing to address the root causes of non-compliance,‚Äù the report added, pointing out that registering with the FIU does not mandate offshore exchanges to set up local subsidiaries or ensure tax compliance. To address these challenges, the report recommended revising Section 194S of the Income Tax Act to make offshore platforms responsible for TDS deductions, even if they‚Äôre not physically based in India, while also lowering the 1% TDS rate to 0.01%. Industry stakeholders have repeatedly pushed for a lower TDS rate and the ability to offset losses, arguing these changes could revitalize domestic trading. Yet, regulators remain largely silent on the issue, with much of the nation‚Äôs focus diverted toward developing its central bank digital currency.

Can $BTC now start to recover, or is there more downside to come? Market sentiment losing momentum Market sentiment is losing its optimistic momentum over the last week as $BTC continues to track downwards after attaining the all-time high of $108,000. Having reached as low as $92,000 last Friday, it is to be wondered if this local downtrend will continue. MicroStrategy makes customary Monday buy announcement On the demand side, MicroStrategy bought again on Monday, as has become the norm over the last several weeks. The company bought $561 million worth, equivalent to 5,262 BTC. U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs experience third straight day of outflows However, this needs to be balanced against the recent sales of Bitcoin by the U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs . The third straight trading day of selling saw a net outflow from the ETFs of 2.38K BTC, making that a total of nearly 12K BTC in net outflow over this three day period. $BTC following classic breakdown pattern Source: TradingView In the 4-hour time frame the $BTC price is following a classic breakdown move. The price fell out of the ascending channel and retested its bottom trendline, before continuing down to perhaps hit the measured move at around $89,600. This would be just below the ascending trendline which bisects the last bull market double top. $BTC respecting multiple year ascending trendline Source: TradingView The weekly chart view for $BTC shows how the price is currently respecting the aforementioned ascending trendline. A confirmed break below this would at least interrupt this upward trend, and perhaps augur a return to the major bull market support at $70,000. The Aroon indicator below is one of the top chart indicators but is not seen as frequently as moving averages, RSI, or MACD et al. The Aroon indicator measures trend strength and indicates potential reversals. Basically, as long as the Aroon Up indicator line is above the Aroon Down indicator line, the trend is up, and when the opposite occurs the trend is down. Currently the jaws between the two indicators are wide apart. A dip for the Aroon Up indicator line down to 70.00 and below would perhaps be the time for some concern. As things stand, this indicator is still looking bullish. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

38044316,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=313969,1735035348,Macro Guru Raoul Pal Predicts Crypto Market Will Rally ‚ÄòPretty Strongly‚Äô Into Year-End ‚Äì Here‚Äôs His Outlook,"Former Goldman Sachs executive Raoul Pal believes that the crypto market will rally heading into the end of 2024. In a new interview with crypto trader Scott Melker, the macro guru says that based on historic precedence, Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other digital assets may put up larger gains during the last week and half of December. A rally at this time of year is often referred to as a Santa Claus rally, a financial term used to describe a calendar effect on traditional equities that historically have gone up on the last five market trading days of the year in December and the first two trading days of the new year. ‚ÄúNormally, what happens at this phase is we should rally into year-end pretty strongly in everything. But then the real game gets played in first quarter.‚Äù Pal also believes that the most explosive rally of the current market cycle is still to come and that it could occur next year, possibly around the Fed‚Äôs meeting in March when rates may be cut. ‚ÄúI think my next phraseology is going to be the banana singularity, that‚Äôs when everything goes bananas‚Ä¶ So we‚Äôre not at the banana zone singularity point yet. That will come as well. That‚Äôs probably sometime Fed March when it all gets silly.‚Äù However, Pal also warns there may be a temporary correction around the end of the year after a rally due to liquidity tightening. He believes the growing money supply is a catalyst for Bitcoin price, and that when it declines so does the flagship crypto‚Äôs price. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs look at the last [US President Donald] Trump administration. So from September to the end of the year, the dollar rallied. September to the end of the year, rates went up. Same narrative. It was all about tariffs and what‚Äôs he going to do and how‚Äôs it going to play out. Almost exactly as the year turned, the dollar went lower, the rates went lower. So I‚Äôve been producing a chart showing that global liquidity tightened and it has a 10-week lead time, and that should mean that at the end of the year, we get a correction.‚Äù Bitcoin is trading for $94,367 at time of writing, down more than 11% in the last seven days.

Among the most innovative projects on the market right now are Qubetics, Hedera, and Stacks. These three cryptocurrencies are addressing some of the most pressing issues in the digital world‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs revolutionising internet security with decentralised VPNs, speeding up blockchain transactions, or unlocking the true potential of Bitcoin with smart contracts. If you‚Äôre wondering which projects will provide not just short-term gains but long-term value, keep reading. Let‚Äôs take a closer look at why Qubetics, Hedera, and Stacks are some of the best cryptos to buy this December 2024 . Qubetics: Decentralising Internet Security with dVPN Qubetics is a Layer 1 blockchain project with a mission to solve some of the most pressing issues in the digital world, including the lack of decentralised VPN (dVPN) solutions. VPNs have become essential for internet privacy, especially with the increasing number of cyberattacks and data breaches. However, most VPNs are centralized, leaving users at the mercy of third-party service providers. This means that your data is still vulnerable to surveillance and exploitation. Qubetics offers a decentralised alternative that puts users in control. By leveraging its blockchain technology, Qubetics provides a secure and privacy-respecting VPN that eliminates the reliance on centralised authorities. This dVPN solution can safeguard users‚Äô data, protect them from privacy violations, and ensure greater transparency in how their information is handled. Moreover, with analysts predicting a price range of $10-$15 for Qubetics after its mainnet launch, the potential for significant returns is undeniable. Qubetics is tackling the real-world problem of security and privacy head-on, making it one of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024. For more information on this revolutionary project, please check out this video . Qubetics-SWFT Blockchain Partnership Raises the Bar for Wallet Innovation Qubetics has taken a bold step forward in blockchain technology with its integration of SWFT Blockchain, setting a new standard for what wallets can deliver. This partnership ensures the upcoming Qubetics Wallet offers unparalleled performance, combining lightning-fast cross-chain transactions with industry-leading security features. Designed to redefine the user experience, the Qubetics Wallet leverages SWFT Blockchain‚Äôs cutting-edge technology to enable seamless management and swapping of assets across multiple blockchains. Whether you‚Äôre a seasoned trader or new to the crypto world, this wallet promises an intuitive and secure experience that stands out in the competitive blockchain space. With a focus on innovation, reliability, and accessibility, Qubetics is not just enhancing wallet functionality but also pushing the boundaries of what blockchain technology can achieve. This collaboration signals a new era of advanced, user-centric solutions, solidifying Qubetics as a key player in the evolving crypto ecosystem. Hedera: Lightning-Fast Blockchain for Real-World Use Hedera has long been known for its lightning-fast transactions and its consensus algorithm, Hashgraph, which offers more scalability and efficiency than traditional blockchain systems. Hedera‚Äôs network can handle thousands of transactions per second, making it one of the fastest blockchain projects out there. This unique ability is crucial for enterprise use cases, such as supply chain management, data storage, and decentralized finance (DeFi). The speed and low cost of transactions on Hedera make it an attractive option for developers and businesses looking to build scalable solutions without compromising on security. Hedera‚Äôs focus on real-world use cases, coupled with its partnerships with major corporations, places it in a strong position to capture more market share in the coming months. For anyone looking for a crypto that has practical applications today, Hedera is one of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024. Stacks: Unlocking Bitcoin‚Äôs Full Potential with Smart Contracts Stacks is a project that aims to unlock the true potential of Bitcoin by enabling smart contracts and decentralised applications (dApps) on its network. Bitcoin, the world‚Äôs largest and most established cryptocurrency, has historically been limited in its ability to support smart contracts. Stacks, however, bridges this gap by providing a layer-2 solution that allows Bitcoin to interact with the broader DeFi ecosystem. With Stacks, developers can build decentralized applications that are secured by the Bitcoin network, which is widely regarded as the most secure blockchain. Stacks also introduces the concept of ‚Äústacking,‚Äù a unique mechanism that allows holders of STX tokens to earn passive income by participating in network consensus. The combination of security, scalability, and passive rewards makes Stacks a standout in the crypto space and one of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024. Conclusion: Investing in the Future As we head into December 2024, Qubetics, Hedera, and Stacks are poised to make a big impact. Whether you‚Äôre looking to take advantage of Qubetics‚Äô privacy-enhancing dVPN, Hedera‚Äôs blazing-fast transactions, or Stacks‚Äô ability to unlock Bitcoin‚Äôs true potential, these cryptocurrencies represent the future of blockchain and digital security. With each project addressing a pressing need in the digital space, they are not just the best cryptos to buy in December 2024 ‚Äîthey are also investments in the future of technology. Don‚Äôt miss out on these opportunities‚Äîget in now before they explode.

The software company is seeking shareholder approval to raise its Class A common shares from 330 million to 10.33 billion and its preferred shares from 5 million to 1.005 billion, according to a proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) . The move comes as part of MicroStrategy‚Äôs ambitious ‚Äú21/21‚Äù plan, a three-year strategy aimed at securing $42 billion in capital. MicroStrategy Aims to Raise $42 Billion to Fund Bitcoin Acquisitions The plan envisions raising $21 billion through equity capital and $21 billion via fixed-income instruments, including debt, convertible notes, and preferred stock. These funds would back the company‚Äôs future Bitcoin acquisitions and strengthen its position as a Bitcoin treasury firm. In addition to the proposed increase in shares, MicroStrategy‚Äôs proxy statement outlines a new equity incentive plan to grant automatic equity awards to incoming board members. The company recently expanded its board of directors from six to nine members, appointing Brian Brooks, Jane Dietze, and Gregg Winiarski. Brooks, a former CEO of Binance.US, and Dietze, a board member at Galaxy Digital, bring notable expertise to the company‚Äôs growing focus on cryptocurrency. ‚ÄúThe proposals we are asking you to consider reflect a new chapter in our evolution as a Bitcoin Treasury Company and our ambitious goals for the future,‚Äù MicroStrategy co-founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor said.

Earlier this week, Saylor announced the acquisition of 5,262 additional Bitcoin for $561 million, bringing the company‚Äôs total holdings to 444,262 BTC, valued at over $41.6 billion. Despite its growing Bitcoin portfolio, MicroStrategy‚Äôs stock fell 8.78% on Monday, closing at $332.23. The stock has lost 17.6% in the past month but has seen a remarkable 450% growth over the past year. Meanwhile, Bitcoin‚Äôs price dipped 1.6% in the last 24 hours to $93,932. MicroStrategy to Join Nasdaq 100 Index The announcement comes as MicroStrategy prepares to join the Nasdaq 100 index on December 23, 2024. The inclusion places the company among the top 100 largest firms on the Nasdaq by market capitalization, offering indirect Bitcoin exposure to stock investors, including those holding the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ), an ETF managing assets worth $322 billion. As reported, Saylor has also expressed strong support for President-elect Donald Trump‚Äôs proposal to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Detailed in his ‚ÄúDigital Assets Framework‚Äù policy published Friday, the proposal outlines a roadmap for the United States to foster growth in the digital asset industry, establish clear compliance standards, and ensure defined rights for crypto asset holders and companies.

According to data from Lookonchain, the whale has already used 5.81 million USDC to acquire 210,420 $HYPE at an average price of $27.6.

As reported by Cryptopolitan, Tayvano‚Äôs claims included references to addresses allegedly linked to the notorious Lazarus Group hackers, who reportedly lost over $700,000 in trading on the Hyperliquid platform. These revelations generated widespread FUD within the Hyperliquid community, triggering the sharp movement of funds. According to CoinGecko, the price of Hyperliquid‚Äôs native token dropped 20%, from $34 on Sunday to $25 by Monday. Hyperliquid labs denies exploit claims On December 23, speculation about North Korean hackers prompted a HYPE whale to sell 1 million tokens. Security sleuth Taylor Monahan suggested that the Lazarus Group may have been testing the platform for vulnerabilities, further fueling the controversy. In a post on X, Monahan shared the ‚Äúsuspicious‚Äù addresses of the alleged DPRK hackers. The posts sparked a broad debate on social media, with some Hyperliquid supporters criticizing her for creating unnecessary panic. In response to the growing controversy, Hyperliquid Labs issued statements on its Discord channel, rejecting allegations of a DPRK exploit. ‚ÄúHyperliquid Labs is aware of reports circulating regarding activity by supposed DPRK addresses,‚Äù the team stated. ‚ÄúThere has been no DPRK exploit ‚Äì or any exploit for that matter ‚Äì of Hyperliquid.

Hyperliquid Labs also addressed reports of unprofessional conduct involving an external security advisor, explaining that the individual‚Äôs behavior prompted them to consult trusted partners instead. After Hyperliquid Labs‚Äô clarifications, the market showed signs of stabilization. Despite the initial sell-off, $HYPE has since rebounded and is currently trading at $27, according to recent updates from DexScreener. Hyperliquid remains a dominant force in the decentralized finance ecosystem. According to data from a Dune Analytics dashboard , Hyperliquid accounts for over 55% of on-chain perpetual futures trading volume. The platform achieved a daily trading average of $8.8 billion in the past week and recently recorded a 24-hour trading volume exceeding $15 billion on Dec. 21. Crypto hacks and fraud incidents continue The security concerns surrounding the crypto entity come amidst a broader context of industry-wide vulnerabilities. In 2024, the crypto sector experienced losses totaling $1.49 billion due to hacks and fraud, according to research by blockchain security startup Immunefi. While this marked a 17% decrease from 2023, hacks remained the predominant cause, accounting for $1.47 billion, or 98.1%, of the total losses across 192 incidents. Fraud, including rug pulls and scams, represented 1.9% of the losses at $28 million, though this category saw a 72% increase year-on-year. The second quarter of 2024 was particularly damaging, with losses reaching $572.6 million, driven by major incidents at DMM Bitcoin and BtcTurk. By contrast, the fourth quarter recorded the least losses at $150.5 million, which could mean investors were taking cautious steps in making transactions as the year comes to a close.

Since launching in July 2023, xAI has grown rapidly, reaching a valuation of $50 billion. In a short amount of time, it has become a major competitor to OpenAI, which is valued at $157 billion. xAI has also outpaced other AI companies like Anthropic ($19 billion) and Perplexity ($2.8 billion), establishing itself as a serious player in the AI market. xAI is also hiring aggressively to fuel its growth. One key product the company is working on is Grok, an AI chatbot that helps users with tasks like text rewriting and image generation. Grok is now available to a wider audience, including through an app on iPhones and on its website, Grok.com. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Quantum Computing Stocks Surge: QTUM Price Gains 50% YTD , Who Invested in xAI? The latest funding round was exclusive to previous investors and individuals who had funded Musk‚Äôs Twitter acquisition. These investors were allowed to buy up to 25% of xAI‚Äôs shares. The Series C round attracted nearly 100 investors, including major venture capital firms and sovereign wealth funds. The minimum investment was around $77,593. With this significant funding, xAI is set to continue its expansion and push the limits of AI innovation. xAI is quickly becoming a powerful competitor in the AI market, challenging the likes of OpenAI. While the company‚Äôs future looks promising, it will be interesting to see whether Elon Musk‚Äôs popularity can help xAI rise to the top of the tech world. xAI is proving that with the right mix of vision, funding, and talent, anything is possible. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Binance has officially announced its support for the rebranding and token swap of Fantom ( FTM ) to Sonic, set for an early 2025 token swap. The exchange will stop processing FTM deposits and withdrawals at 3:30 UTC on Jan. 13, 2025, and delist all FTM trading pairs, including FTM/BTC, FTM/USDT, and FTM/ETH. After that, trading for the new Sonic (S) coin will open on Jan. 16, 2025, when pairings including S/BTC, S/BNB, and S/USDT will become live. The FTM tokens will be converted to Sonic at a 1:1 ratio, which means that users will get the same number of Sonic tokens for each FTM they own. All technical parts of the swap will be managed by Binance, so users won‚Äôt need to do anything on their own. However, FTM withdrawals won‚Äôt be supported after the token swap is finished. You might also like: FTM jumps 12% as Sonic Labs targets $11T lending market with new blockchain feature This token swap is in line with Binance‚Äôs history of assisting with token migrations of this kind, such as the well-known MATIC to POL token change, in which Binance made the switch easy for users. Futures, Margin Trading, and Simple Earn are among the services that Binance will be upgrading as part of the transition. In the affected products, FTM will be replaced by the new S token. With a total supply cap set at 15% yearly inflation until 2031, there will be about 2.88 billion S tokens in circulation at launch. As part of an incentive program designed to attract developers to the Sonic network, users will be eligible to get up to 90% of the funds their apps produce. Additionally, the platform will provide a 190 million S airdrop and an Innovator Fund to encourage users of the Sonic and Opera chains. You might also like: Investors bullish on Fantom ahead of Sonic upgrade Users‚Äô FTM tokens will remain functional on the Opera network for the foreseeable future if they decide not to upgrade to the S token. However, users will need to possess the S token to engage in transactions, governance, and other activities on the new Sonic network . Key points to note here are: At 3:30 UTC on January 13, 2025, all FTM trading pairs were delisted and deposits and withdrawals were halted. Sonic (S) token trading starts at 8:00 UTC on January 16, 2025, with pairs such as S/USDT, S/BTC, and S/BNB. Before the deadline, Binance encourages FTM token holders to update or terminate any open positions in FTM-related services, including loans, margin positions, and trading bots. When the S token is launched, more information and updates will be given by the cryptocurrency exchange and the Sonic network .

Wallet Growth Signals Growing Adoption The second positive signal coming for XRP is related to wallet holders growth. Santiment data indicates a rise in non-empty XRP wallets of 5.75 million over the past two years, meaning growth of 28%. An increase like this mirrors greater trends in increasing cryptocurrency acceptance seen with the bigger coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum. üò≤ The past 2 years have seen big increases in cryptocurrency holders. Here are the number of non-exmpty wallets for crypto‚Äôs top 4 coins by market cap: Bitcoin $BTC: 54.7M (+27% rise) Ethereum $ETH: 134.9M (+47% rise) Tether $USDT: 6.57M (+66% rise) XRP $XRP: 5.75M (+28% rise) pic.twitter.com/rcd50VAikZ ‚Äî Santiment (@santimentfeed) December 23, 2024 The rise in wallet numbers shows that more investors are now ready to stick on XRP for the long run, therefore stabilizing its price and raising its market presence.

Let‚Äôs dig deeper into the reasons behind this shift and why IntelMarkets is standing out as a preferred alternative! Ripple‚Äôs XRP Faces Volatility: A Closer Look at the DeFi Coin Price Trends! The latest reports highlight a significant decline in the number of new XRP Ledger accounts being created. Once averaging over 30,000 new accounts daily, the number has now fallen to just 1,756 by December 22, 2024, suggesting that Ripple is facing challenges in attracting new investment. The decrease in adoption, coupled with slower market activity, has sparked concerns about XRP‚Äôs future prospects. As the DeFi coin battles against a dwindling user base, these developments have led many to question whether Ripple can recover or if its position in the market will continue to erode. XRP‚Äôs fluctuating performance throughout December 2024 has added to its uncertain conditions. Currently trading around $2.20, experts anticipate further XRP price dips, with predictions suggesting the Ripple coin price could fall to $1.76 soon. As a result, many Ripple coin investors are diversifying their portfolios, with IntelMarkets catching their attention as a promising alternative. Whale Moves 150 Billion PEPE Amid Market Drop: Are Investors Looking for Safer Bets? A prominent whale recently moved 150 billion PEPE tokens, worth $2.72 million, to Binance. This adds to a previous move in November 2024 when the same whale withdrew $2.94 million in PEPE. The whale‚Äôs unrealized losses are mounting, with $219,000 in PEPE. As PEPE‚Äôs price keeps decreasing, more liquidations are likely, deepening the pessimistic market outlook. The token has been majorly unstable since the start of December 2024, currently trading along the $0.0000180 price level. Experts foresee further declines, with a possible dip to $0.0000177. In response to this, many investors are diversifying into safer options like IntelMarkets. How IntelMarkets‚Äô Dual-Chain Functionality and High Leverage Drive Success As crypto market uncertainty persists, traders and investors are turning to IntelMarkets for its extensive range of tools to navigate the volatility. A standout feature is its dual-chain functionality. This allows traders to choose between Ethereum and Solana blockchains for the most favorable trading conditions. This flexibility reduces costs and improves transaction speeds. IntelMarkets also provides traders with up to 1000x leverage, allowing them to maximize returns on even small market movements. The platform offers a broad range of asset pairs and deep liquidity, ensuring efficient execution of large trades. Additionally, IntelMarkets‚Äô perpetual futures contracts provide traders with valuable hedging options, allowing them to secure their positions in a volatile market. INTL Surpasses $5 Million in Presale: Is It the Best Time to Invest? IntelMarkets has reached Stage 8 in its public presale, with each INTL token priced at $0.073, with more than $5.2 million raised so far. The ongoing presale has experts predicting a 100x price increase post-launch. This projection places IntelMarkets as a highly attractive investment for those seeking diversification into a platform with tangible real-world utility. With its extensive suite of features, IntelMarkets offers traders and investors a reliable way to protect their portfolios amid market instability. As the presale progresses, the platform is poised for substantial expansion, making it a top contender for investors searching for reliable alternatives to navigate market volatility.

38043861,https://crypto.news/?p=14321803,1735034400,Solana and Ripple traders are seeing a 500% return on this new token,"Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. While Solana and Ripple are struggling, many traders are seeing a 500% return by stockpiling this new exchange token. Table of Contents DTX Exchange seen as the next big thing amid unique offering Solana price in the red, analyst remains bullish Bark: The price of XRP will rise soon Can DTX Exchange skyrocket like Solana and Ripple? The crypto market is always moving, and recently, Solana (SOL) and Ripple (XRP) have been bleeding on the price charts. Although experts like Captain Faibik and Bark see price growth for these altcoins in the future, many traders are focusing on a new token: DTX Exchange (DTX) . This phase six presale star has already given early buyers a 500% return. Since it will bring innovation to online trading, experts even foresee this rookie becoming the next 3x crypto coin in 2025. DTX Exchange seen as the next big thing amid unique offering While Solana and Ripple seem to face challenges right now, DTX Exchange is thriving. Its ongoing presale performance has been outstanding, with over $10m raised and 300k users onboarded. Plus, early buyers of this altcoin are already seeing a 500% return. People are trusting the long-term vision of DTX Exchange, to become a huge force in online trading. It will launch a hybrid trading platform with the best of CEX and DEX to accomplish this. On it, people will get: Over 120k asset classes: The ability to access stocks, FX, and over 100K crypto pairs in one place. Anonymity: Traders will remain anonymous thanks to no sign-up KYC checks on DTX Exchange. Up to 1000x leverage: DTX Exchange will offer up to 1000x leverage on assets, meaning a $100 investment could help traders access liquidity of up to $100k. The DTX native token is a big part of its ecosystem. Those who hold it will get governance voting rights, staking rewards, and more. Currently, one DTX costs just $0.12 during phase six of its presale. But this altcoin price will rise to $0.14 after phase seven begins. Plus, everyone is waiting for a Tier-1 CEX listing, which may trigger a rally to $0.20. This could make DTX one of the best altcoins for fast returns. Solana price in the red, analyst remains bullish Solana has been in a downtrend recently. CoinMarketCap shows that the price of Solana fell nearly 30% in the past month alone. In that time, its value moved between the $250 level and around $180. Nevertheless, crypto analyst Captain Faibik remains optimistic for Solana. In a recent X post, he told his followers that this altcoin has broken out and retested a bullish pennant on its weekly chart. He predicts a potential surge to $400 for the Solana coin soon. Although this Solana price prediction has excited many traders, experts also note that its market cap is nearly $90b. Therefore, Solana would need a lot of new money to experience a noteworthy price surge. But tokens like DTX Exchange will not face this issue. You might also like: Last chance to get DTX Exchange before it soars, set to follow ETH, XRP Bark: The price of XRP will rise soon Ripple is a top 5 cryptocurrency but it has seen a lackluster performance on the charts. In the past seven days, the value of this altcoin has fallen from around $2.40 to nearly $2.20. In other words, nearly a 10% drop as per CoinMarketCap. However, market expert Bark made traders more confident with his Ripple price prediction. According to his X post, the next Ripple candle will melt faces. In his opinion, this altcoin could see a price jump to $3.50 soon. Other experts think it may not be as big if the Ripple crypto sees a price jump soon. Since this crypto coin has already experienced a 250% surge on the YTD charts, its highest upswings may have passed. Therefore, traders are looking at DTX Exchange instead. Can DTX Exchange skyrocket like Solana and Ripple? DTX Exchange is gaining traction within the crypto space by seeing 500% growth. Given that Ripple and Solana are working through turbulence, DTX provides a brand new avenue of growth potential. Since it will also tap into the growing $1.4t FX market and boast a smaller market cap, its value may surge way faster than its peers. Therefore, many experts think that DTX could soar by 3x in 2025.

38043853,https://coinpaper.com/6703/bitcoin-miner-terawulf-leverages-ai-for-revenue-growth,1735034400,Bitcoin Miner Terawulf Leverages AI for Revenue Growth,"Regulatory scrutiny and rising operational costs are reshaping the technology landscape as companies navigate compliance challenges and evolving business models. Italy‚Äôs data protection authority recently fined OpenAI ‚Ç¨15 million for privacy violations tied to its flagship AI model, ChatGPT, highlighting the need for transparency in AI data practices. Meanwhile, Bitcoin miner TeraWulf is diversifying into artificial intelligence to offset increasing mining expenses, showcasing how AI's growing demand is influencing strategies across sectors. TeraWulf Expands into AI with 70 MW Lease Amid Rising Bitcoin Mining Costs TeraWulf, a prominent Bitcoin mining company, is diversifying its operations as it faces mounting Bitcoin mining costs. On Dec. 23, the firm announced a significant pivot toward artificial intelligence (AI) by leasing over 70 megawatts (MW) of data center infrastructure to Core42, an AI and cloud service provider. The agreement will see Core42 utilize the 70 MW of infrastructure at TeraWulf‚Äôs Lake Mariner facility in upstate New York. The facility will be energized in phases between the first and third quarters of 2025. This partnership is expected to bolster TeraWulf‚Äôs earnings by complementing its existing Bitcoin mining operations with AI-driven computing revenue streams. Paul Prager, CEO of TeraWulf, highlighted the strategic importance of this move. ‚ÄúSurging demand for scalable, energy-efficient infrastructure presents a tremendous opportunity,‚Äù Prager said. ‚ÄúThis agreement not only diversifies our revenue streams but also significantly enhances our long-term earnings potential.‚Äù TeraWulf‚Äôs expansion into AI comes as Bitcoin miners grapple with rising production costs. According to a recent report from CoinShares, the weighted average cash cost to mine a single Bitcoin rose by 13% to $55,950 in the third quarter of 2024. These escalating costs have squeezed profit margins across the sector, prompting miners to explore alternative revenue opportunities. The report also noted that higher production costs have led to a decrease in the market share of public Bitcoin miners within the network‚Äôs overall hashrate. Several companies, including TeraWulf, are now reallocating capital to AI and cloud computing projects, reflecting a broader industry trend toward diversification. TeraWulf‚Äôs Q3 financial performance highlighted the pressures facing Bitcoin miners. The company reported earnings of minus 6 cents per share, falling short of analysts' expectations of minus 3 cents per share. Despite these setbacks, TeraWulf has benefited from Bitcoin‚Äôs 48% price surge this quarter, which pushed the cryptocurrency above the six-figure mark for the first time. However, the stock market response to TeraWulf‚Äôs announcement was muted. On Dec. 23, TeraWulf‚Äôs share price closed down 12.1% at $5.81, although it regained 2% in after-hours trading. Despite the recent dip, TeraWulf remains one of the strongest performers in the Bitcoin mining industry, with its share price up 152.6% in 2024. Shifting Industry Dynamics The partnership with Core42 comes amid a growing trend among Bitcoin miners to pivot toward AI and cloud computing. CoinShares noted that AI is increasingly attracting the attention of traders and venture firms, offering new avenues for growth as mining costs rise. Other miners have taken a different approach, such as issuing convertible notes to buy more Bitcoin instead of expanding their operations. TeraWulf‚Äôs strategy of pursuing organic growth at its existing facilities aligns with its stated commitment to shareholder returns. In July, the company revealed its openness to a potential merger to boost operating hashrate but emphasized that such a move would not be made solely for ‚Äúempire building.‚Äù As the Lake Mariner facility transitions into a dual-purpose site supporting both Bitcoin mining and AI-driven computing, TeraWulf positions itself as a versatile player in the digital infrastructure space. The phased rollout of the new infrastructure is expected to provide steady revenue growth over the coming years, balancing the volatility of Bitcoin mining with the stability of AI and cloud computing demand. With Bitcoin‚Äôs price volatility continuing to influence the sector, TeraWulf‚Äôs diversification strategy could serve as a blueprint for other miners seeking to navigate the challenges of rising costs and competitive pressures. Whether this approach will sustain its upward trajectory remains to be seen, but the company‚Äôs willingness to adapt to market conditions is a promising sign for its future. Italy Fines OpenAI ‚Ç¨15 Million Over Data Privacy Violations and Orders Public Awareness Campaign In other AI news, Italy‚Äôs data protection authority, the Garante, has imposed a ‚Ç¨15 million ($15.7 million) fine on OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, following an extensive investigation into the company's data collection practices. The ruling brings attention to significant concerns about data privacy, transparency, and age verification in the deployment of generative artificial intelligence models. The Italian Data Protection Authority (IDPA) stated on Dec. 20 that OpenAI violated data privacy regulations under the European Union‚Äôs General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) by processing users‚Äô personal data without a proper legal basis. The watchdog also noted that OpenAI failed to notify the agency of a data breach that occurred in March 2023. The IDPA‚Äôs findings criticized OpenAI for breaching the principles of transparency and user information obligations. It stated that the company did not adequately inform users about how their data was being collected and utilized to train its flagship AI model, ChatGPT. The investigation also revealed that OpenAI lacked sufficient mechanisms to verify users‚Äô ages, potentially exposing minors under 13 years old to inappropriate responses generated by the AI. The IDPA emphasized that this failure posed significant risks to children‚Äôs development and self-awareness. In addition to the fine, the IDPA ordered OpenAI to conduct a six-month public awareness campaign to educate the public about ChatGPT‚Äôs data collection practices. This campaign is expected to span multiple platforms, including radio, television, newspapers, and the internet. The campaign will aim to inform users and non-users alike about how their data is collected and used to train generative AI, as well as their rights to oppose, rectify, or delete their data under GDPR. Following the campaign, users are expected to have a clearer understanding of how to exercise their data protection rights, including opting out of having their data used for AI training purposes. The IDPA‚Äôs investigation began in March 2023, shortly after Italy became the first Western country to temporarily ban ChatGPT over privacy concerns. At the time, the IDPA cited suspected breaches of data protection rules and demanded greater transparency from OpenAI. The ban was lifted in late April after the company implemented additional privacy safeguards. The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) played a role in shaping the investigation‚Äôs outcome, providing an opinion on the use of personal data in developing and deploying AI models. The IDPA said it considered this opinion before concluding its probe. Fine and Mitigating Factors Under GDPR regulations, companies can be fined up to ‚Ç¨20 million or 4% of their global turnover for violations. The IDPA noted that OpenAI‚Äôs cooperative attitude during the investigation helped reduce the size of the penalty. During the investigation, OpenAI moved its European headquarters to Ireland, placing it under the jurisdiction of the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC). The IDPA confirmed that the DPC is now the lead supervisory authority for any future investigations into OpenAI. The fine and public awareness campaign signal a turning point in regulatory oversight of AI models in Europe. The IDPA‚Äôs actions shed some light on the growing scrutiny that generative AI companies face as governments and regulators aim to balance innovation with user privacy and data security. Italy‚Äôs approach also highlights the challenges of enforcing data protection laws on rapidly evolving technologies. While the temporary ban on ChatGPT earlier this year drew criticism, it has set a precedent for other countries to evaluate their own data privacy measures. OpenAI‚Äôs case could prompt further inquiries into the practices of other AI developers, particularly as generative AI becomes increasingly integrated into daily life and business operations. OpenAI has not yet issued an official response to the fine or the IDPA‚Äôs orders. However, the company previously apologized for outages and other disruptions as it worked to address regulatory concerns. It remains to be seen how OpenAI will adapt its data handling practices in response to the IDPA‚Äôs ruling.",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6703/bitcoin-miner-terawulf-leverages-ai-for-revenue-growth,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

38043689,https://crypto.news/?p=14321836,1735034007,North Korean hackers likely behind DMM Bitcoin‚Äôs $307m attack,"Japanese police revealed Tuesday that hackers affiliated with the North Korean regime are likely behind the $307 million attack on crypto exchange DMM Bitcoin. North Korean hackers are said to be behind a multi-million attack on a crypto exchange, which cost the platform over $300 million worth of crypto in stolen funds. In a Dec. 23 press release , the Federal Bureau of Investigation alongside Japan‚Äôs National Police Agency revealed that the hack, which occurred in May, is linked to North Korean cyber actors and is associated with the threat group known as TraderTraitor, also referred to as Jade Sleet, UNC4899, and Slow Pisces. According to authorities, the cyber attack began when a North Korean hacker, pretending to be a recruiter on LinkedIn, contacted an employee at Ginco, a Japanese company that provides crypto wallet software. The hacker tricked the employee into downloading a malicious Python script, which was disguised as part of a pre-employment test. The employee unknowingly uploaded the script to their personal GitHub page, allowing the attacker to gain access to sensitive company systems. You might also like: US shuts down North Korean crypto laundering network By mid-May, the attackers used stolen session cookies to impersonate the compromised employee and infiltrated Ginco‚Äôs unencrypted communications system, leading to a manipulation of a legitimate transaction request from DMM Bitcoin. Eventually, this scheme allowed the hackers to steal 4,502.9 ( BTC ), equivalent to $307 million at the time. The stolen cryptocurrency was later transferred to wallets controlled by the TraderTraitor group, the FBI said. As crypto.news reported earlier, the United States and South Korea have teamed up to create new mechanisms to prevent crypto thefts linked to North Korea . The two countries have reportedly signed an agreement to jointly create technologies to stop crypto thefts.

38043585,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=632633,1735033576,What a strong peso means for Bitcoin in Argentina,"The Argentine peso is throwing punches no one saw coming. In a country famous for runaway inflation and a currency weaker than yesterday‚Äôs promises, the peso has risen by over 40% against its trading partners‚Äô currencies this year. That‚Äôs no typo. Libertarian President Javier Milei‚Äôs fiscal shock therapy turned a collapsing currency into one of the strongest in the region. But don‚Äôt let the headlines fool you. This economic U-turn could hit Argentina‚Äôs beloved Bitcoin harder than anyone anticipated. Tourism, once a golden ticket for Argentina‚Äôs economy, is taking the first hit. After attracting bargain-hungry tourists with cheap wine and steaks, the tables have turned. Tourists are now steering clear of Argentina‚Äôs inflated prices. Locals, meanwhile, are swapping their vacation dreams for shopping sprees abroad. Bitcoin, which had been a lifeline for Argentinians battling a crumbling peso, is also caught in the crossfire of this new economic reality. A peso on steroidsZ flips the script Milei‚Äôs policies have made the peso a giant contender in the global currency ring. By clamping down on monetary emission and keeping the official exchange rate steady, he‚Äôs fueled an economic transformation. On the black market, where the peso had long been battered, Milei‚Äôs stabilization plans have done the impossible ‚Äî strengthened it. Demand for the greenback has plummeted as Argentinians begin trusting their currency again. Inflation has slowed slightly, dropping to 24% in November, but not enough to ease the overall pain. The strong peso is expensive for everyone, especially tourists. The number of visitors spending at least one night in Argentina has nosedived 20.2% compared to the same period in 2023. Uruguayans, Bolivians, and Chileans led the exodus, with arrivals falling 50.9%, 33.4%, and 28.3%, respectively. Even Argentinians are running for the border, with outbound travel jumping 37.7% in the same period. Meanwhile, Americans and Canadians showed more resilience, with a smaller drop of 11.5%. And here‚Äôs a twist‚ÄîEuropeans are bucking the trend. The number of European tourists actually increased by 3.5%, proving there‚Äôs always someone willing to pay for overpriced empanadas. Bitcoin‚Äôs balancing act Now, let‚Äôs talk Bitcoin. Argentina‚Äôs relationship with crypto is as volatile as its economic history. Over the past year, Bitcoin‚Äôs price in pesos has surged by 566.69%, despite recent market fluctuations. As of press time, one Bitcoin trades for 95.7 million ARS. In the years of hyperinflation and peso freefall, Bitcoin became a safe haven. Argentinians turned to it to escape the chaos, with many opting for stablecoins to hedge against local economic disasters. By mid-2024, Argentina accounted for 61.8% of Latin America‚Äôs stablecoin transaction volume. But now, the peso‚Äôs resurgence is reducing the need for alternatives like Bitcoin. Fewer people are looking to ditch their pesos for crypto, even as Bitcoin continues to grow in value. This doesn‚Äôt mean Bitcoin is irrelevant. Far from it. For many Argentinians, it remains a hedge against uncertainty. The scars of decades of economic instability don‚Äôt heal overnight. Even as the peso stabilizes, trust in traditional systems is still shaky. Analysts predict Bitcoin could stabilize at around 105.3 million ARS by Q1 2025, but that depends on both local economic policies and global crypto trends.

Donald Saves Crypto (DONALCRY), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONALCRY is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Saves Crypto can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Saves Crypto could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Saves Crypto launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Saves Crypto on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald Saves Crypto by entering its contract address ‚Äì Gyy3ss5Yj2ioZWuz6BNbDPGUGUxhwoCskRuU2cGo9k2Q ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONALCRY.

This represents a major 14.5% correction from its all-time high of just over $108,000, recorded on December 17. Although Bitcoin briefly recovered to touch $95,000, it slipped back to $94,000 in early trading on December 24. The leading digital asset is now down more than 11% over the past week, casting a shadow over expectations for a year-end surge. Historically, crypto markets have performed well during the festive season, especially in bull markets, with traders observing strong rallies in late December. However, Bitcoin‚Äôs dismal performance this year has tempered the optimism typically associated with this period. Historical Trends Fail to Deliver The concept of a Santa Claus rally ‚Äîa price increase in the final trading days of December through early January‚Äîhas been a recurring trend in previous market cycles. Notably, in 2016 and 2020, Bitcoin saw substantial gains between Christmas and New Year, years that marked the peaks of respective market cycles. A recent CoinGecko study highlighted that from 2014 to 2023, crypto markets experienced a Santa Claus rally in eight out of ten instances. During these years, total crypto market capitalization surged by 0.7% to 11.8% in the week spanning December 27 to January 2. However, the absence of a rally in 2021, a year that marked the peak of the previous cycle, underscores a key point: Bitcoin‚Äôs December performance is heavily influenced by broader market conditions. With 2025 expected to be the next cycle‚Äôs peak year, the lack of festive cheer this year aligns with historical patterns of mid-cycle corrections. Volatility and Sentiment Signal Potential Recovery Adding to market uncertainty, around $18 billion worth of Bitcoin and Ether options contracts are set to expire on December 27. This could introduce major volatility, potentially impacting Bitcoin‚Äôs short-term price movements. Meanwhile, Bitcoin‚Äôs social sentiment reached its lowest level this year on December 22. Interestingly, such negative sentiment often precedes a recovery, as market conditions stabilize and investors regain confidence. While December has failed to deliver the hoped-for rally, traders remain cautiously optimistic about Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term trajectory , with eyes set on the patterns leading into 2025‚Äôs anticipated market peak.

This type of swap comes with high fees, but can be an exit point for hackers. A list of addresses linked to previous North Korean hacker exploits has surfaced in a series of MetaMask swaps. The addresses only swapped $200K in crypto assets, leaving $1,985 in swap fees. The MetaMask router is among the high-fee tools to swap crypto, but can be fast and accessible for hackers to obscure the origin of funds or avoid token freezing. While the sum was small, the event itself was ominous, given the perception that DPRK hackers don‚Äôt trade, but test. Hacking activity slowed down in the second half of 2024, but there are still signs of mixing and trying to conceal funds. The MetaMask discovery follows another episode of hacker addresses using Web3 services, DEXs and the wallet‚Äôs native router. Recently, inflows from hacker addresses were discovered on the Hyperliquid bridge. The perpetual futures DEX was not exploited in any way, but the event was also considered a test for moving funds. Some consider Hyperliquid to be still at risk, due to its limited validator points that can be exploited. MetaMask itself has not been compromised and has remained a secure wallet, barring personal mistakes. Taylor Monahan, @tayvano, also noted the wallet has been targeted in multiple ways by North Korean hackers, who are always looking for ways to unlock stored crypto. ‚ÄúMetaMask is and always has been concerned‚Ä¶We track DPRK carefully because they are the single largest threat to crypto companies. We also track every other crypto threat actors bc DPRK is largest but not the only threat,‚Äù said @tayvano in a recent X post . North Korean hackers avoid USDC as lockable asset While slowing down their exploits, North Korean hackers have been swapping funds and moving between chains. The list of wallets that used MetaMask swaps also has a long history of using various decentralized protocols. The wallets swap between Ethereum (ETH) and stablecoins USDT and USDC . Both stablecoins are, in theory, freezable assets, but especially USDC. For that reason, the wallets always swap back to ETH or other tokens, or move to the Arbitrum chain for some of the tasks. The wallets never keep a USDC balance for long, despite the highly active usage of the token. The two addresses were highly active, interacting with ENS accounts, OpenSea users and web3 protocols. The swaps continued in the past few hours, again with the main task of moving funds on a relatively small scale. 0x52263cAEc2e144C3A84cc16d014157360Ac85A89 0x070cA92f568037d351666b3918a0F6ba7ad20ED1 The wallet activities and their counterparties connect to some of the most active recent protocols, meme tokens, NFTs and other assets. However, most of the activity centers around swapping into stablecoins as a temporary step. Wallet activity raises more concerns about the safety of Hyperliquid The recent swaps were relatively minor, with transactions under $500. However, some of the wallet counterparties showed interactions with DEXs and DeFi hubs, often transacting with the Hyperliquid bridge. The alleged hacker wallet histories also contain interactions with Hyperliquid from the past few hours and days. For now, the protocol has not been attacked directly, but some consider it another tool for mixing funds or trading to obscure the origin of tokens. The Hyperliquid bridge is the biggest concern for attacks, since the hub‚Äôs value grew exponentially. The bridge holds more than $2B, and may not be sufficiently protected , according to @tayvano. For now, there is no other direct link between the MetaMask swap users and a potential attack against the bridge. The MetaMask swaps may be a part of general activity to move between assets with minimal tracking. North Korean hackers reportedly doubled their haul in 2024, potentially taking up to $1.3B from the crypto market. Most of the activity was concentrated in the first half of the year, with major hacks slowing down in the last quarter.

38042733,https://coinpedia.org/?p=397006,1735032205,Singapore Overtakes Hong Kong as Asia‚Äôs Crypto Hub,"The post Singapore Overtakes Hong Kong as Asia‚Äôs Crypto Hub appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In 2024, Singapore has surged ahead to become the top crypto hub in Asia. Over the past year, the city-state has issued 13 crypto licenses to major platforms like OKX, Upbit, Anchorage, BitGo, and GSR, doubling the number of licenses granted in 2023. This rapid growth is the result of smart, flexible policies and an environment that encourages innovation. But as Singapore shines, Hong Kong struggles to keep up. Keep reading to find out how the two cities are shaping the future of crypto in Asia. Why Singapore is Winning the Crypto Race A big reason for Singapore‚Äôs success is its flexible regulations. Unlike Hong Kong, which has strict policies on token listing and custody of customer assets, Singapore‚Äôs policies are more open and welcoming to new crypto businesses. This has allowed smaller crypto firms to flourish alongside established financial institutions, promoting innovation and growth. Additionally, Singapore is more open to a wider variety of tokens, unlike Hong Kong, which only allows trading in Bitcoin and Ether. This openness makes Singapore even more attractive to crypto companies. Hong Kong Struggles to Keep Up On the other hand, Hong Kong has struggled to keep up with Singapore‚Äôs fast growth. By the end of 2024, Hong Kong had only licensed seven crypto platforms, with just four approvals coming on December 18. This slower pace highlights the challenges Hong Kong faces in competing with Singapore. Hong Kong‚Äôs stricter regulations have led some major exchanges, such as OKX and Bybit, to withdraw their applications. Additionally, Hong Kong‚Äôs close ties to China, where crypto trading is banned, make some international crypto companies hesitant to set up shop. The political risks involved create a less welcoming environment for innovation, further limiting Hong Kong‚Äôs appeal. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Russia Bans Crypto Mining in 10 Regions Until 2031: Key Details Revealed , Blockchain Innovation in Both Cities Both Singapore and Hong Kong have made strides in blockchain technology .

Buy $BBT Tokens Now & Start earning today As You Await the Explosive Growth Tron (TRX) potential TRON (TRX) has experienced significant growth in 2024, with its price hitting an all-time high of $0.44 on December 4 , propelling its market cap to over $35.1 billion. This surge was largely fueled by Justin Sun‚Äôs $30 million investment in Donald Trump‚Äôs crypto project, which brought heightened attention to TRON as a prominent layer-1 blockchain. However, since reaching this peak, TRX has faced a 31% correction, with its price currently sitting at $0.2434. Despite this pullback, TRON remains a major player in the crypto space, with strong growth potential. TRON investors are now increasingly drawn to opportunities like FXGuys , a foreign exchange trading platform offering the potential for substantial gains, with some predicting returns of up to $10,000 on a $100 investment. This reflects TRON holders‚Äô confidence in emerging platforms that promise high-profit margins and substantial market growth. Sui (SUI), a prominent blockchain network, is facing significant challenges as it grapples with its recent delisting from Binance‚Äôs spot trading pairs. This delisting highlights Sui‚Äôs struggles to meet liquidity and trading volume requirements, causing its market cap to drop by 4.22% to $13.33 billion and its price to fall by 4.1% in a single day. Despite these setbacks, Sui has continued to work on its platform, but the market‚Äôs current response indicates a lack of investor confidence. The coin is currently trading at $4.41 with a 24 hour dip of 2.38%.As big investors seek new opportunities, platforms like FXGuys have emerged with innovative staking models and profit-sharing mechanisms, signaling a shift in interest away from Sui. While Sui‚Äôs challenges mount, it remains to be seen how the project will adapt to stay relevant in the competitive blockchain space. Conclusion TRX and SUI have created waves in the crypto space with captivating rallies. However, they may offer less return potential in the short term. BlockBoost emerges with technology set to tackle a blockchain hurdle. If you are a new or old investor always looking for the best presales to buy, the BlockBoost project is set to give you easy access to a list to consider. Recent crypto news highlights that BlockBoost is set to soar to $0.05 from its current price, suggesting a staggering 5000% Returns.

His goal is to craft policies that align with the evolving landscape of digital assets and promote collaboration across political divides. Hoskinson has emphasized that cryptocurrency is not a partisan issue but a global one. He believes progress can only happen if lawmakers from both sides come together to explore crypto's potential for the country. In his recent statements, Hoskinson highlighted the need for unity, urging Republicans and Democrats to put aside their differences and evaluate what cryptocurrencies can bring to the table. One of the key figures Hoskinson plans to engage with is Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman. According to Hoskinson, Fetterman exemplifies the type of leadership needed for the cryptocurrency sector ‚Äîleaders willing to question party lines and embrace new ideas. Fetterman, known for his unconventional approach, has recently made headlines by offering a nuanced perspective on Donald Trump‚Äôs political influence, attributing his appeal to voters who see him as protecting their version of the American way of life. Hoskinson argues that crypto is being unfairly targeted in the ongoing political clashes. He criticized the Biden administration and policymakers like Senator Elizabeth Warren for their harsh stance on the industry, suggesting that this political environment is stifling innovation and progress. Additionally, Hoskinson is advocating for a ""Crypto Users Bill of Rights"" to address key concerns in the crypto space. This proposal aims to ensure consumer protection, fair taxation, and clear asset classification . As part of this initiative, he has launched ""Operation Baseline,"" a campaign to identify inefficiencies in the U.S. cryptocurrency market and push for legislation to resolve these issues.

38042366,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=375941,1735031571,Is Ripple (XRP) Gearing up for a Christmas Rally? (Analysts Weigh in),"TL;DR Ripple (XRP) fell from $2.50 to under $2 but recovered to $2.25, with analysts eyeing a substantial rally in the coming weeks. XRP whales bought 120 million tokens over the past week, reducing supply and potentially setting the stage for a price pump. Final Push for the Year? Ripple‚Äôs XRP was among the leading cryptocurrencies that were the worst affected amid the latest market correction. Its price tumbled from over $2.50 on December 17 to less than $2 three days later. The bulls managed to recover some ground in the past few days, with XRP currently trading at approximately $2.25 (per CoinGecko‚Äôs data). Still, that represents a 10% decline on a weekly scale. XRP Price, Source: CoinGecko Despite the fluctuations and the recent pullback, many analysts remain optimistic that XRP could experience a substantial rebound in the near future. Crypto Bitlord, an X user with almost 400,000 followers, thinks ‚Äúthe final pump for 2024 is loading.‚Äù The market observer predicted a price rally to as high as $12 next month, suggesting that ‚Äúthe rise starts now.‚Äù JAVON MARKS was also among the bulls. They touched upon XRP‚Äôs 4-hour chart to envision the confirmation of a ‚ÄúHidden Bullish Divergence‚Äù that could take the valuation to over 2.90 and a subsequent jump to a new all-time high. For their part, CrediBULL Crypto claimed that ‚Äúthe XRP/BTC chart below looks absolutely fantastic‚Äù and ‚Äúthe most bullish-looking chart in the entire space.‚Äù As such, the analyst said they will look to open a long position once again for another trade in the following days. Whales on the Move The latest correction of the crypto market, which started shortly after the Fed announced another interest rate cut but also hinted at a pause of the policy for next year, seems to have been welcomed by XRP whales. On December 20, X user Ali Martinez revealed that such large investors have purchased around 80 million tokens in the span of three days. Earlier today (December 24), he claimed that whales have stacked up on an additional 40 million coins. Such actions reduce the circulating supply of XRP, which could be followed by a price rally (assuming demand stays the same or heads north). Massive whale purchases may also trigger excitement among smaller investors who could also hop on the bandwagon, thus creating further upward pressure on the price.

Nevertheless, prevailing price actions suggest a possible market shift. The dog-themed cryptocurrency joined today‚Äôs altcoin bounce-back , gaining nearly 10% after steadying around the $1.885 barrier. Source ‚Äì Coinmarketcap While we cannot rule out the possibility of downtrends, WIF seems to regain upside momentum, supporting solid moves in the upcoming sessions. The meme token exhibits a bullish structure on its price chart, suggesting bullish momentum. Stabilizing above $1.885 could catalyze significant reversals toward the $2.895 resistance. That would translate to a 45% upswing from WIF‚Äôs current price of $2.00. That would open the path to the $4.830 target. However, Dogwifhat required a massive bullish comeback to fuel such gains. Sudden bearishness could plunge the token towards $1.885. Failure to keep this zone could trigger another 21.17% slide to $1.486. Dogwifhat price: bullish signals support near-term gains Dogwifhat‚Äôs market sentiments display optimism after recent dips. Open Interest soared 7% over the past day to $391.05 million ( Coinglass data ). Also, the daily long/short ratio inches towards 1, currently at 0.986, suggesting increasing bullish bets from traders. That shows participants are opening positions as WIF recovers. Furthermore, the Average Directional Index shows materializing strength with steady uptrends from 22.70 on December 16 to 32.31 at press time. Source ‚Äì TradingView The ADX indicator measures trend strength, with figures above 50 suggesting strong trends and below 20 signaling weak trends. Furthermore, the Chaikin Money Flow trends upward and approaches zero. It increased from -0.17 to -0.10 within the past day. An increasing CMF suggests magnified buying volume, signaling impending uptrends for the asset. WIF price will likely soar if the indicator surpasses the zero line. The current Chaikin Money Flow readings indicate accumulations after rebounding from the support zone. Nevertheless, this buying could trigger a minor decline before amplified bullish momentum. Moreover, spot traders are moving their Dogwifhat balances to private addresses, highlighting long-term holding. That shows confidence in the altcoin‚Äôs future performance. Future of meme assets: absence of DOGE ETF dents sentiments Industry players have advocated exchange-traded funds that expose investors to multiple cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum . Nonetheless, investment managers appear to distance themselves from meme token ETFs. ETF Store president Nate Geraci stated that failure to file for DOGE ETF is a marketing mistake and a missed opportunity for companies reluctant to adopt the meme token.

Analysts Explain Whether There‚Äôs Light at the End of the Tunnel,"Matrixport, a leading cryptocurrency analytics firm, has expressed a cautious outlook for Ethereum and other altcoins in its latest daily market analysis. The firm noted that the recent rally in Ethereum‚Äôs price appears to be temporary and has limited potential for a sustained recovery. According to Matrixport, Bitcoin continues to dominate the cryptocurrency market, as reflected by its rising dominance rate. This trend highlights Bitcoin‚Äôs ability to maintain its position as a primary driver of market sentiment and activity. In contrast, Ethereum‚Äôs dominance has been steadily decreasing, a trend that began with the launch of ETH ETFs in early summer 2024. Despite billions of dollars in inflows, these funds have failed to reverse Ethereum‚Äôs downward trend.

The analysis suggested that investors may need to take a patient approach and foresaw potential growth opportunities for ETH in 2025.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed a modest 0.16% after early losses, and the Nasdaq Composite surged 0.98%, fueled by heavyweights like Nvidia, Tesla, and Meta Platforms. Investors soaked up the gains , but the crypto market told a different story. Bitcoin struggled, trading at $94,500 as of press time, which is $14,000 below its all-time high set on December 17. MicroStrategy, the ultimate Bitcoin hype train, stumbled hard. Its shares nosedived 8.8% on Monday, a rough debut in the Nasdaq-100 index. For a company that rides or dies with Bitcoin‚Äôs price, this wasn‚Äôt entirely shocking. MicroStrategy‚Äôs billions in Bitcoin: A double-edged sword Despite the Monday setback, MicroStrategy has had a monster year. The company‚Äôs stock is up 426% in 2024, making it one of the hottest U.S. tech firms valued over $5 billion. The reason? Bitcoin. The company began stockpiling the crypto in 2020, a gamble that has now inflated its Bitcoin holdings to nearly $43 billion. This crypto obsession pushed MicroStrategy‚Äôs market value from $1.1 billion all the way to $82 billion. But here‚Äôs the thing: that value exists only as long as Bitcoin stays hot. Bitcoin drops? MicroStrategy drops harder. Monday was a perfect example. Bitcoin slipped to its 50-day moving average, a critical level for traders. What‚Äôs weighing on it? Well for starters, the Federal Reserve might slow interest-rate cuts in 2025. Investors are cooling off on risky bets, and Bitcoin, like it or not, is the poster child for speculation. Even with President-elect Donald Trump pushing for looser crypto rules, the market isn‚Äôt fully convinced just yet. Trump‚Äôs Bitcoin crusade Trump‚Äôs victory lit a fire under Bitcoin. The apex crypto has soared 40% since Election Day, with traders betting big on his pro-crypto rhetoric. He has appointed a pro-crypto SEC chair, Treasury Secretary, IRS commissioner, and has even set up a Crypto Council for his White House Crypto Czar. Meanwhile, Bitcoin ETFs have also seen massive inflows since the election win. Over $12 billion has poured into these funds, but the excitement is starting to cool. On December 19, the products recorded their biggest one-day outflow in months, showing us that some investors are taking a breather. But MicroStrategy isn‚Äôt slowing down. The company just announced another $561 million Bitcoin purchase, its seventh consecutive week of buying. Meanwhile, the broader crypto market is mirroring Bitcoin‚Äôs ups and downs. Ether and DOGE have both doubled in value this year, but they‚Äôre still following Bitcoin‚Äôs lead. And it has had a 125% rally since the year started. Thin trading volumes could add more volatility this week. U.S. markets will close early today and take a break on Wednesday for Christmas, leaving fewer players to stabilize the game.

Bitcoin dropped from its $100K mark creating doubts in investors‚Äô minds. What‚Äôs next? Binance Delists Several Cryptos: What Does It Mean for Traders? Binance has revealed that it will delist several well-known cryptocurrencies from its platform on December 27. The affected trading pairs are ACE/BTC, ACM/TRY, BOME/BTC, DYM/BTC, MTL/TRY, PIXEL/BNB, PIXEL/FDUSD, QKC/BTC, RAD/BTC, REZ/FDUSD, and TUSD/TRY. However, this doesn‚Äôt mean the cryptocurrencies will be completely removed; they will still be available to trade against other pairs on the platform. The decision is part of Binance‚Äôs regular review process to improve the quality of trading. Pairs are typically delisted when they don‚Äôt meet liquidity standards or generate low trading volumes over time. Market Reaction in Downtrend This announcement has already led to price fluctuations for the affected cryptocurrencies, as traders quickly adjusted their positions. In the past, such news has sparked panic in the market, often leading to concerns about reduced liquidity. Binance has also stated that it may take additional steps to manage risks if market conditions worsen. These measures could include adjusting leverage, position sizes, and funding rates to ensure stability. What Are Investors Doing Now? With the long-term effects of this delisting still unclear, many investors are rethinking their strategies and adjusting their portfolios. The market remains uncertain, and traders are watching closely for any further changes that could impact these assets. Current Price Snapshot Here‚Äôs a look at how some of the delisted cryptocurrencies are performing: Fusionist ACE (ACE) : Trading at $2.15, ACE has seen a 2.97% rise in the last 24 hours, with a trading volume of $10.88 million. It ranks 490th with a market cap of $90.86 million. AC Milan Fan Token (ACM) : ACM is priced at $1.63 and has gained 3.1% both in the past 24 hours and over the past week. Book of Meme (BOME) : At $0.006528, BOME has fallen by 18.10% in both short-term and weekly periods. Dymension (DYM) : Trading at $1.50, DYM has increased by 5.5% in the last 24 hours. While Binance‚Äôs delisting often leads to market disruptions, the outcome can vary. Some cryptocurrencies have gained value after being delisted, while others have experienced minor declines. This suggests that the market still sees potential in these assets, and they may regain momentum in the near future.",NEGATIVE,BNB | BOME,EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB | BOME,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/binance-delisting-bome-ace-acm-and-3-more-tokens/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

XRP: A Fast, Borderless Cryptocurrency for Global Payments XRP is a cryptocurrency supported by the XRP Ledger, designed for fast and low-cost transactions across borders. It operates on a decentralized system without a central authority, making transactions secure and irreversible. XRP does not require a bank account for settlements, promoting financial inclusion. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, it was launched with an initial supply of 100 billion XRP. Ripple, initially called OpenCoin Inc., was gifted 80 billion XRP to improve network liquidity and support the ecosystem. Ripple placed 55 billion XRP in escrow to control supply release. XRP aims to facilitate seamless payment transfers across various currencies. Its technology has potential in global payments, and its market attractiveness depends on current cycles. PEPE Coin: A Deflationary Memecoin Inspired by Pepe the Frog PEPE is a deflationary memecoin launched on the Ethereum network, drawing inspiration from the popular Pepe the Frog meme of the early 2000s. It seeks to replicate the success of memecoins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin by eliminating transaction taxes and embracing its identity as a pure memecoin without utility. In mid-2023, PEPE reached a peak market capitalization of $1.6 billion, igniting enthusiasm among crypto enthusiasts and fostering a vibrant community. The coin‚Äôs roadmap includes phases aimed at boosting visibility and adoption through social media trends and listings on major exchanges. PEPE features a burning mechanism to enhance scarcity and rewards long-term holders, operating as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum‚Äôs Proof-of-Stake network. Conclusion XRP and PEPE show less promise in the short term. Meanwhile, DOGEN stands out as a token for those pursuing excellence, symbolizing luxury and success. Anticipated to grow by 700% before the presale ends, with potential for massive returns this altcoin season, DOGEN follows successful tokens like BONK, WIF, and Popcat. It fosters a community of leaders, offering real benefits and exclusive perks for early supporters.

However, integration of account abstraction (AA) sets wallets like Ambire apart from existing browser wallets. It makes supporting existing EOAs possible and also unlocks derived smart accounts without compromising the EOA security model. Ambire recently launched a gamified campaign enabling early extension beta users to seamlessly adopt smart accounts and AA. The incentivized campaign aims to educate users on smart account benefits. Users create an Ambire account, connect to the Legends dApp , and choose an RPG-styled character. They earn XP points as they perform on-chain actions, advancing their character up from level 0 and unlocking rewards in the process. A combination of narrative background, visual style, and gameplay mechanics typically defines RPG (role-playing game) characters. Their (often) rich, elaborate backgrounds explain their personality traits and vice versa, providing insight into their motivations, just like individuals in the real world. In that sense, they can reflect traits and features the player wishes to adopt. Players can adjust or develop a character's attributes to match their play style, including traits like charisma, strength, intelligence, etc. AA is the missing link Account abstraction is a blockchain technology allowing people to use smart contracts as their accounts. AA aims to improve user security and experience in the crypto space by enabling users to establish their own wallet management rules. It provides features such as recovery mechanisms, governance, and code execution. An EOA allows the user to generate cryptographic pairs of keys: a public one to create addresses and a private one letting them control the account. The account and the signer are the same entity within the EOA framework. This way, a pseudonymous user network can transfer value in a permissionless environment. However, the design lacks features inherent to AA, which alleviate the friction users experience when interacting with blockchain technologies. The ERC-4337 standard upgrades AA, enabling users to set up non-custodial wallets as programmable smart contracts and providing team wallets, easy wallet recovery, signless transactions, etc. Exploring the connection between RPG and AA The connection between RPG and AA lies in the shared principles of customization, flexibility, and dynamic management of roles, assets, and permissions. Characters often have unique roles in RPGs, such as warriors, as well as customizable skills and attributes. In AA, users can customize their blockchain accounts with specific roles and permissions, allowing them to behave in ways beyond simple wallet functionality. Examples include executing multi-sig transactions and enforcing programmable spending limits. Both systems prioritize user-defined functions and adaptability for gameplay mechanics and transaction logic, respectively. Managing assets and inventory RPG characters manage inventories, including weapons, armor, and consumables, often with restrictions, like a weight limit. In AA, accounts manage cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and other digital assets according to smart contract rules, such as limiting asset transfers according to specific terms. Both systems incorporate mechanisms for managing resources according to specific rules, providing structure and strategic control. The parallels in permission systems Team members in RPGs often have different roles that require them to cooperate. Permission systems govern who uses certain skills or assets. Likewise, AA-enabled wallets allow multiple users or roles to co-manage an account, mirroring cooperative RPG mechanics. Both emphasize role-based functionality to achieve shared goals. Reflecting the user's personality and experience RPG characters are designed to reflect individual player traits, choices, and strategies, giving a sense of agency and ownership. Similarly, abstracted accounts prioritize user experience by allowing more intuitive interactions with the blockchain, such as gasless transactions. Both systems aim to empower users with tools to customize their experience and simplify the underlying mechanics. The evolution of smart wallets: flexible and user-centric The smart wallets of the future integrate principles of RPGs and AA to ensure a flexible, user-centric experience. They borrow RPG concepts like progression, roles, and customization, fusing them with AA's technical advantages to offer more intuitive and powerful wallet functionalities. Smart wallets assign roles or permissions to users or sub-accounts. The owner has full control over the wallet, the guardian is responsible for backup or recovery, and the spender has limited permissions for daily transactions. The wallet might distribute access among family members, each with specific permissions. For example, one approves transactions, the other spends, etc. Ambire is propelling an innovative concept involving visual design and gamification. RPGs' visual appeal, gamified mechanics, and progress indicators make them engaging. Likewise, smart wallets can use gamification and visual elements to enhance user experience, such as dynamic dashboards displaying portfolio growth or progress bars for wallet setup or achieving milestones. A wallet might display DeFi earnings as XP and use milestones to reward users, e.g., based on a set number of completed transactions. One final parallel involves ecosystem synergy. RPG characters interact with vendors and non-playable characters. The wallets of the future seamlessly engage with gaming apps, staking and lending platforms, and NFT marketplaces.

In contrast, many altcoins have produced a lot more impressive increases over the past 24 hours, including ETH, XRP, BNB, and others. BTC Stalls at $94K It was precisely a week ago when the primary cryptocurrency was flying confidently above $100,000 and even registered an all-time high of over $108,000. However, the landscape started to change later that day and especially on Wednesday after the last FOMC meeting for the year. BTC dropped to $105,000 at first, but the bears pushed it south a lot harder on Thursday and Friday. The correction culminated on Friday, at least for now, with a price dump to $92,000. The bulls finally reemerged at this point and didn‚Äôt allow a breakdown beneath $90,000. In fact, BTC bounced off during the weekend and even jumped above $99,000 on Saturday. Nevertheless, that was short-lived once again, and the asset plummeted once again at the start of the current business week to under $93,000 yesterday, perhaps due to the rising net outflows from the US-based ETFs. Despite recovering some ground since that daily low, bitcoin is still sluggish at around $94,000. Its market cap is well below $1.870 trillion on CG, while its dominance stands close to 54%. Bitcoin/Price/Chart 24.12.2024. Source: TradingView Altcoins Outperform Interestingly, while BTC is down by 1% in the past day, most altcoins have turned red. ETH, BNB, XRP, DOGE, ADA, TRX, and SHIB have posted gains of around 2-3%, while AVAX, LINK, and SUI have jumped by 5-6%. Even more impressive daily price increases come from the likes of HBAR and AAVE, both of which have jumped by double digits. The biggest gainers from the top 100 alts include VIRTUAL (24%), PENGU (16%), BGB (15%), HNT (13%), and MOVE (13%). The total crypto market cap has added around $20 billion since yesterday and is above $3.460 trillion now. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

Many analysts have weighed in on SHIB‚Äôs possible direction, but for a unique perspective, we turned to Grok, the AI chatbot from Tesla CEO and pro-crypto billionaire Elon Musk. SHIB is currently trading at $0.00002214, reflecting a 4.14% increase from yesterday, and Grok has analyzed various predictions for SHIB‚Äôs price as of January 1, 2025. Predicted Price Range For Shiba Inu (SHIB) Grok highlights a range of predictions for SHIB‚Äôs price in early 2025. One analysis projects that SHIB could reach approximately $0.00002710 by January 16, indicating a modest increase from its current trading price. Grok also highlighted another source that estimates that the cryptocurrency‚Äôs value might fall between $0.0000159 and $0.0000490 in early 2025. While there‚Äôs a chance it could drop below the crucial $0.00002 level, a rise to $0.0000490 would represent the asset‚Äôs highest level since it fell from its all-time high in late 2021. Notably, other analysts have projected a similar target for SHIB , suggesting a massive breakout is in its immediate future. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 More Predictions for Shiba Inu (SHIB) Grok provided a few more predictions for the digital asset. It noted that some predictions lean toward a more bullish outlook, with one forecast suggesting SHIB could potentially peak at $0.000047 during 2025. Conversely, Grok highlighted less optimistic projections, including a potential low of $0.0000126, and an average price of $0.00003311. In addition to formal analyses, Grok analyzed social media posts to provide insight into the community‚Äôs expectations. According to Grok, user posts on X reflect a wide spectrum of predictions, ranging from conservative estimates like $0.000025 to more ambitious targets, such as $0.0000998. Grok noted that the variability in these predictions highlights the inherent volatility of cryptocurrency markets. Based on the available data, the chatbot expects SHIB to trade between $0.0000159 to $0.0000490 in January 2025. January could be an exciting month for the Shiba Inu community. Although Grok‚Äôs prediction suggests the asset might experience a notable surge, some analysts have projected an even higher climb. One notable prediction is a surge of over 250% to $0.00005816, a new multi-year high, and some have projected even higher targets for the asset, reflecting the optimism in the community.

38041557,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=632612,1735029741,Cosmos Network developers transfer dormant 295.3 BTC raised through ICO in 2017,"Cosmos Network developers have made significant moves with their crypto holdings, transferring 295.3 Bitcoin (BTC), valued at approximately $27.7 million, from funds raised during their 2017 Initial Coin Offering (ICO). This marks the first transfer of Bitcoin by the team in nearly two years, according to blockchain analyst Yu Jin. Cosmos Network conducted its ICO in April 2017, raising about $17 million in contributions comprising 4,882.7 BTC and 246,891 Ethereum (ETH). Over the years, the value of these assets has surged exponentially. Yu Jin noted that these recent sales and transfers likely stem from the funds raised during the ICO, where significant contributions in Bitcoin and Ethereum were received. Owing to the recent market bull run that saw BTC reach new highs, its holdings significantly increased in value. According to Yu Jin‚Äôs analysis, the unsold portion of these holdings, combined with previously liquidated amounts, transformed the initial $17 million into a staggering $213.1 million. Cosmos Bitcoin and Ethereum transactions in 2024 Since the 2017 ICO, Cosmos developers have transferred a total of 4,786 BTC and 229,703 ETH. Despite these recent transfers, they still retain 96.4 BTC and 17,188 ETH, currently valued at $67 million. The steep appreciation of BTC and ETH over the years has significantly amplified the value of the unsold assets. Cosmos Network crypto movements ‚Äì Source: X The latest Bitcoin transfer adds to a series of high-value sales made by Cosmos developers this year. In October 2024, Interchain Foundation, the team behind Cosmos, sold 4,000 ETH for $9.5 million. Between April and October 2024, the foundation sold a total of 15,100 ETH, valued at $37.09 million. These transactions have brought this year‚Äôs total sales to 21,600 ETH and 295.3 BTC, amounting to $78.67 million. Like the broader crypto market, Cosmos‚Äô native token (ATOM) is having a tough December, dropping 24% in the last 30 days. At press time, per CoinGecko data , ATOM is changing hands at $6.79, a 6.6% uptick from its values 24 hours ago. Bitcoin price short-term struggle prompts investors to cash out on gains Bitcoin‚Äôs price is currently facing some struggles, decelerating downwards from a 6-day high of $99,000 to trading just above $93,000, according to recent updates from CoinGecko. The recent price consolidation phase could have prompted whales like Cosmos to sell, which may increase the selling pressure even further. Bitcoin‚Äôs struggling price ‚Äì Source: TradingView Bitcoin remained above the $92,000 mark last Friday, offering some relief to the market over the weekend. However, the $100,000 level continues to present a significant challenge for buyers. The crypto remapped its support near $93,000 today, climbing briefly to $96,000 before facing rejection. It has since retreated to the $93,500 level, shedding at least $1,000 in value. While bullish interest persists, momentum remains limited. If bulls regain control, Bitcoin could attempt another rally past $100,000. Sustained gains above this level may bolster the ongoing bullish trend within its ascending channel, though it risks entering overbought territory. Conversely, a breakdown from this channel could lead to a sharper decline in the coming days, potentially testing six-week lows before any meaningful recovery.

With over $250 million leaving the platform in just 30 hours, questions are swirling about the platform‚Äôs security and whether it has become a target for state-backed hackers. But the story doesn‚Äôt end there‚Äîrecent developments have only deepened the mystery.

The possibility that they are targeting Hyperliquid has raised alarms in the crypto space. Monahan noted that Hyperliquid uses only four validators, and some of its infrastructure is centralized, making it an easy target for advanced hackers.

Critics argue that Hyperliquid‚Äôs failure to address security concerns has only worsened the situation.

38041137,https://coinpaprika.com/news/ex-marginfi-co-founder-launches-rival-project-paladin,1735029271,Ex-Marginfi Co-Founder Launches Rival Project Paladin,"Edgar Pavlovsky, former co-founder of Marginfi , abruptly left the Solana DeFi project in April 2024, citing disagreements over internal and external operations. Eight months later, he is now a core contributor to Paladin, a Solana client designed to prevent sandwich attacks while increasing validator rewards. At the same time, Temporal, a crypto research firm with ties to Marginfi, introduced Nozomi, another Solana client aimed at preventing sandwich attacks. Although both projects address similar problems, they differ in their execution. Paladin integrates a token called PAL , while Marginfi has yet to launch its own native token, despite growing criticism from its user base. Temporal‚Äôs Nozomi client prioritizes transaction speed and prevents sandwich attacks by only allowing transactions to be sent to trusted validators. Jakob Povsic, a Temporal developer, claims Nozomi democratizes trading by offering institutional-level transaction precision to everyday users. In contrast, Paladin is a fork of the Jito-Solana client, focusing on identifying and blocking sandwich attacks directly in transaction bundles. Pavlovsky explained that Paladin prioritizes transactions with higher fees and will eventually limit access through the PAL token. Despite their similarities, Pavlovsky downplayed the rivalry, stating he supports Temporal‚Äôs efforts and believes multiple projects can coexist successfully. However, Povsic offered a sharper critique, calling Paladin's approach ‚Äúnaive‚Äù and accusing it of arbitrarily blocking transactions. He also criticized Paladin's reliance on its token model, suggesting it creates unnecessary complexity. Pavlovsky dismissed these claims, asserting that Paladin's methods are systematic and rigorously tested against network-wide sandwiching strategies. Ben Coverston, a Temporal partner, added that Paladin's reliance on token incentives could make the system exploitative, contrasting it with Nozomi's straightforward focus on transaction speed and validator trust. Coverston emphasized Nozomi‚Äôs open-source philosophy, suggesting it avoids some of the potential pitfalls of Paladin's token-based model. The lack of a Marginfi token remains a controversial topic. While many platforms use points programs to reward users ahead of token launches, Marginfi has not yet issued one. Pavlovsky admitted he was in favor of launching a token and believed Q4 2023 was the ideal time to do so. However, he stopped short of directly linking this frustration to his departure. Both Paladin and Nozomi aim to solve significant challenges in Solana‚Äôs validator ecosystem, but their approaches‚Äîand philosophies‚Äîdiffer sharply. For now, the competition remains a mix of collaboration, rivalry, and contrasting visions for Solana‚Äôs decentralized finance future.",NEGATIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,MINING | SOL | TRADING | RESEARCH,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/ex-marginfi-co-founder-launches-rival-project-paladin,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/38041137.jpeg

Discover This Game-Changing Presale Set to Inspire Crypto Enthusiasts,"The crypto world is buzzing with possibilities as 2024 comes to a close. Near Protocol (NEAR) has been a standout with its MetaMask integration, making it a pioneer among non-Ethereum chains. This move has cemented its reputation as a go-to for Web3 adoption. But the market never stops evolving. Enter Qubetics ($TICS) , a revolutionary Layer-1 blockchain aggregator that‚Äôs rewriting the rules with its presale performance and innovative applications. Qubetics isn‚Äôt just another blockchain project; it‚Äôs tackling real-world inefficiencies with bold solutions. Its presale, now in its 14th stage, has raised over $7.5 million, captivating more than 11,500 investors. For those who missed the NEAR train, this is your chance to join one of the top altcoins to join in December 2024 . Qubetics ($TICS): A New Standard in Blockchain Innovation Qubetics has quickly become the talk of the town, and it‚Äôs no surprise why. At $0.0377 per token, its presale offers a ground-floor opportunity before the price jumps by 10% this weekend. With more than 372 million tokens sold and analysts predicting ROI numbers that seem almost surreal, an investment of $25,000 now could yield incredible returns. For instance, if $TICS hits $15 after its mainnet launch, that investment could balloon to a staggering $9.9 million. But it‚Äôs not just the numbers that make Qubetics shine. This Web3 aggregator aims to unify blockchain ecosystems, solving the longstanding problem of fragmentation. Game-Changing Cross-Border Transactions Imagine sending money across borders without the headaches of traditional banking fees, delays, or complex processes. Qubetics is turning this vision into reality. Consider a small business owner in Azerbaijan importing goods from Turkmenistan. With Qubetics, cross-border payments can be completed in seconds, cutting out middlemen and saving time and money. Or picture an independent professional in Kazakhstan working remotely for clients in Russia and receiving payments seamlessly through the blockchain. No intermediary fees, no stress. Qubetics is set to revolutionise transactions, making global commerce more accessible for everyone. Why Qubetics is the Next Big Thing Its presale momentum, innovative cross-border solutions, and potential to unify blockchains make Qubetics one of the top altcoins to join in December 2024. This project isn‚Äôt just inspiring‚Äîit‚Äôs setting a new standard. Near Protocol (NEAR): Pioneering Web3 Adoption Near Protocol has been a trailblazer, becoming the first non-Ethereum blockchain to integrate fully with MetaMask. This move simplifies dApp development for developers and enhances user experiences, allowing seamless exploration of the Near ecosystem. The market responded positively to this integration, viewing it as a significant step toward mainstream adoption. Near Protocol has positioned itself as a frontrunner in simplifying blockchain for both developers and end-users, a critical factor in driving the next wave of Web3 adoption. Challenges Amid the Hype Despite these advancements, NEAR has faced market turbulence. Its price reflects this volatility, with bearish pressures occasionally dampening enthusiasm. However, long-term investors remain optimistic, believing that NEAR‚Äôs foundational innovations will drive its value upward over time. Why Near Protocol Stands Out Near Protocol‚Äôs ability to simplify blockchain access and its strategic innovations make it one of the top altcoins to join in December 2024. For those invested in the future of Web3, NEAR remains a cornerstone project. The Final Thoughts Based on our research and analysis, both Qubetics and Near Protocol represent the cutting edge of blockchain innovation. While Near Protocol continues to build on its solid foundation with tools like MetaMask integration, Qubetics is forging a new path with its revolutionary solutions and unmatched presale success. For those looking to diversify their crypto portfolio, Qubetics offers the potential for massive growth, especially with its unique applications in cross-border transactions. Don‚Äôt miss the chance to join this movement before its presale price jumps this weekend. Whether it‚Äôs the transformative potential of NEAR or the boundary-pushing innovation of $TICS, these projects are the top altcoins to join in December 2024. Are you ready to take the next step? Join the Qubetics presale today and be part of the blockchain revolution.

38040989,https://coinpaprika.com/news/hyperliquid-denies-being-hacked-by-lazarus-group,1735028975,Hyperliquid Denies Being Hacked by Lazarus Group,"Hyperliquid has firmly denied any security breach linked to North Korea's Lazarus Group , despite on-chain evidence suggesting suspicious activity. Blockchain data indicates that wallet addresses tied to Lazarus deposited and withdrew significant amounts of ETH from the platform on December 23. Security expert Taylor Monahan from MetaMask highlighted vulnerabilities in Hyperliquid‚Äôs system, stressing the risk of exploitation even without direct interference with user funds. Rumors of a potential breach have triggered mass withdrawals, with users pulling out $60 million from Hyperliquid amid growing concerns. The platform‚Äôs HYPE token also saw a sharp decline in value. In response, a Hyperliquid executive addressed the situation on Discord, firmly denying any security compromise. The executive insisted that no evidence of vulnerabilities had been shared and that all user funds were secure. Despite these reassurances, on-chain data shows Lazarus-linked accounts transferring around $476,489 in ETH through the platform. While this isn‚Äôt definitive proof of an exploit, it raises concerns about the unusual transaction volumes linked to suspicious addresses. Monahan emphasized the seriousness of the threat posed by Lazarus, describing them as ‚Äúhighly sophisticated and persistent attackers.‚Äù The Lazarus Group is widely recognized for its role in major crypto heists, including the Radiant Capital hack earlier this year. They reportedly stole nearly $900 million in 2024 alone. Monahan warned that Hyperliquid‚Äôs system might be vulnerable due to operational security oversights. She pointed out that the platform relies on only four validators running identical code and suggested that key personnel may have overlapping access to critical systems, increasing the risk of lateral attacks. Monahan also expressed concerns about potential malware exposure through shared devices. If even one executive's private device is compromised, it could lead to a catastrophic breach. She criticized Hyperliquid‚Äôs dismissive stance, stating that the platform‚Äôs defensive response signals a lack of urgency in addressing these risks. While Hyperliquid denies any breach and claims user funds are secure, the crypto community remains on high alert. Experts agree that even if Lazarus hasn‚Äôt accessed user assets, their increased interest in the platform signals a potential future threat. For now, the exchange continues to reject accusations, but skepticism remains strong as the industry closely watches for further developments.",NEGATIVE,ETH,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/hyperliquid-denies-being-hacked-by-lazarus-group,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/38040989.jpeg

The firm announced that it plans to closely monitor these areas and make further progress in 2025. The report also speculates on possible regulatory changes following Donald Trump‚Äôs expected inauguration on January 20, 2025. HTX Ventures predicts the repeal of Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121, a move that would allow traditional financial institutions to hold crypto assets on their balance sheets. This change could accelerate institutional adoption of crypto by providing new financing avenues and making spot crypto more accessible through established institutional exchanges and partnerships. Related News: Giant Altcoin Claimed to Have Been Hacked by the North Koreans Issues Statement The firm predicts that this regulation will increase the maturity of the institutional crypto market.

His pro-crypto policies and promises of clearer regulations have sparked unprecedented interest in the sector, leading to record-breaking growth in the crypto market. Following Trump‚Äôs victory, cryptocurrency adoption among users aged 18‚Äì25 increased by an incredible 683%. This spike is attributed to optimism around his pro-Bitcoin stance , which has especially resonated with younger generations. Data from Bitget shows Gen Z users now make up 53.8% of new participants on the platform, marking a significant demographic shift in the crypto market. In Europe, similar trends have emerged. The region‚Äôs crypto-related ETPs have grown by $6 billion since November 2024. November alone saw $135 million in new investments in European crypto ETPs, the third-highest month of the year. The UK‚Äôs crypto ownership rate rose to 12% , up from 10% earlier, as reported by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Awareness of cryptocurrencies in the UK also increased from 91% to 93%, with average holdings climbing to ¬£1,842 from ¬£1,595. A Binance survey involving over 27,000 participants across five continents found that 45% entered the crypto market in 2024. However, 44% of these investors allocate less than 10% of their total assets to crypto, signaling growing confidence in digital currencies as a stable long-term investment. Trump‚Äôs establishment of a strategic Bitcoin reserve and a Bitcoin and Crypto Advisory Council has amplified this optimism. These policy moves have helped Bitcoin prices reach new all-time highs, with Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies following suit. In the UK, businesses are already focusing on creating solutions to enable smooth crypto-to-fiat transactions, catering to the rising demand for such services. This pivotal moment highlights how political decisions can shape financial behavior and open new doors for cryptocurrencies globally.

In contrast, Singapore‚Äôs regulatory environment has been more flexible, offering a conducive ecosystem for both established players and newcomers in the blockchain space. Hong Kong‚Äôs regulatory hurdles slow crypto expansion Hong Kong‚Äôs stringent crypto regulations, particularly regarding asset custody and token policies, have created barriers for firms seeking licenses. By the end of 2024, the city had issued just seven full licenses, with four approved under restrictive conditions as late as December. Provisional permits have been granted to an additional seven firms, but some prominent exchanges, including OKX and Bybit, have withdrawn their applications, citing operational and profitability challenges. Hong Kong‚Äôs exclusivity to Bitcoin and Ether trading limits investor access to smaller altcoins, stifling market growth. Moreover, the lingering influence of China‚Äôs crypto ban adds a layer of risk for firms operating in Hong Kong‚Äôs special administrative regime. Despite these challenges, Hong Kong has made notable strides in wholesale blockchain initiatives, including the HK$6 billion ($770 million) sale of digital green bonds via HSBC‚Äôs tokenization platform. On the retail front, Hong Kong launched spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs in April 2024, but they have underwhelmed compared to their US counterparts. These ETFs have accumulated just $500 million in assets, far below the $120 billion managed by US issuers. Singapore‚Äôs flexible framework attracts crypto giants In contrast, Singapore‚Äôs licensing regime encourages collaboration between traditional financial institutions and crypto startups, fostering innovation and inclusivity. This has drawn global heavyweights such as Anchorage, BitGo, and GSR to establish a presence in the city-state. Notably, Singapore‚Äôs initiatives like Project Guardian and Global Layer 1 focus on asset tokenization and blockchain commercialisation, supported by the Monetary Authority of Singapore. Singapore‚Äôs adaptability and proactive measures have solidified its position as a ‚Äúsafe, long-term choice‚Äù for digital-asset firms. The country‚Äôs regulatory framework strikes a balance between risk and opportunity, making it an attractive hub for regional operations. Market players view Singapore‚Äôs approach as more conducive to innovation, creating opportunities for smaller entrants and fostering growth across the crypto ecosystem.

More than the recent ones, the older tokens are gaining more attention. Tokens like Aave & Hedera have been attracting massive volume, indicating a fine rise of over 25% could be fast approaching. Aave Testing the Neckline of a Bullish Pattern The AAVE price had broken out of a bullish pattern in the long term and after a minor retracement, the ascending trend has been revamped. The bulls are accumulating strength along a major resistance and a breakout from the current range may pave the way to mark a new ATH in the first few days of 2025. The short-term price action of AAVE suggests huge potential in surpassing the crucial resistance at $400. The token has broken the Adam & Eve pattern and triggered a rise of over 10% followed by a horizontal consolidation. The stochastic RSI has reached the oversold zone and is preparing for a rebound while the MACD is about to undergo a bearish crossover. Therefore, the price could be slightly correct below $370, which may attract a strong rebound that may elevate the levels beyond $400 and reach $420 very soon. Hedera (HBAR) Price Aims to Reach $0.35 The HBAR price is slowly rising towards the cycle highs in the times when the markets continue to remain sluggish. Meanwhile, the bears managed to restrict the rally below $0.3 for a while, but the current breakout suggests a major upswing is imminent, indicating a new ATH could be on the way. The HBAR price broke the falling wedge pattern in the short term and is printing constant bullish candles. The RSI is incremental, while the Ichimoku cloud has just turned bullish. Therefore, the price is believed to maintain a healthy upswing to reclaim the lost levels at $0.38, which may further push the price above $0.4 before the end of the year.

38040574,https://crypto.news/?p=14321797,1735028264,Philippines SEC releases new crypto regulatory framework draft,"The Securities and Exchange Commission Philippines shared a draft of its cryptocurrency regulations framework. Stakeholders are invited to give feedback on the draft no later than Jan. 18, 2025. According to the recently shared document , the published regulatory draft is titled ‚ÄúSEC Rules on Crypto-Assets Service Providers (CASP Rules).‚Äù The framework covers a range of crypto trading activities, including the requirements necessary to get an SEC -issued license, market activities, and public offerings. The SEC Philippines emphasized the importance of creating a regulatory framework for cryptocurrency, as the nation has seen rapid growth in the sector. ‚ÄúThe continued growth and development of new crypto asset markets, services, and business models relies on clear, proportionate, and robust regulatory frameworks, which can ensure that markets are fair, efficient, and transparent.‚Äù As a result, the SEC proposed through the draft that crypto service providers must register with the SEC and obtain a CASP license if they wish to operate in the Philippines. Stakeholders are also urged to give input regarding the regulatory framework up until Jan. 18, 2025. To be eligible for a CASP license, firms have to comply with the rules outlined in the framework, have at least four staff members who reside in the country, must have a stock corporation registered with the SEC, and must meet the minimum capital requirements set by the SEC. You might also like: Philippines‚Äô stablecoin PHPC debuts on Ronin sidechain If a registered firm is thought to have violated the rules outlined in the framework, the SEC will conduct an investigation into the crypto firm‚Äôs business dealings and daily operations to detect any wrongdoings. Sanctions include fines, a cease and desist order, and revocation of the CASP license. In order to mitigate risks of money laundering and cybersecurity threats, CASP license holders are expected to align their systems in accordance with the National Cybersecurity Plan. They also have to go through regular audits and review procedures to ensure their systems are protected against emerging threats. On the other hand, companies planning to conduct public offerings to sell or distribute crypto assets must first submit a disclosure document to the SEC. The document should also be published on the firm‚Äôs website and all social media platforms at least 30 days before the actual offering takes place. The disclosure document should include information on the crypto asset offeror, the crypto asset issuer, the underlying technology used, rights and obligations linked to the crypto asset, potential risks, and warnings about the possible loss of value. Additionally, the document also has a special section outlining the prohibition of market manipulation, insider trading, and unlawful disclosure of Information. In May 2024, the Philippine SEC Chair Emilio B. Aquino declared that the government agency would introduce a set of guidelines to regulate crypto trading activity by the second half of 2024. The announcement came a few months after the Philippine SEC banned Binance from operating without a license.

Starting in January 2025, the restrictions aim to control energy consumption while ensuring industries get the power they need. But this isn‚Äôt just a blanket ban‚Äîtemporary mining restrictions will also apply during peak energy demand periods. What does this mean for the future of cryptocurrency mining in Russia? Keep reading to find out. Regions Affected by the Mining Ban The ban will apply to regions including Dagestan, Chechnya, and the Donetsk and Lugansk People‚Äôs Republics, where cryptocurrency mining will be entirely prohibited. This step is part of a broader effort to manage Russia‚Äôs energy resources more efficiently while supporting industrial needs. In regions like Irkutsk, Buryatia, and Zabaikalsky, mining will only be restricted during high-energy demand periods. These restrictions will be in place from January to March 2025, and from November to March in subsequent years, when energy use typically surges. Flexibility for Future Adjustments Officials have noted that the list of restricted regions could change based on advice from the government commission in charge of managing electric power. The primary goal is to ensure stable energy supplies for industries while controlling the strain on the grid caused by cryptocurrency mining. Building on Russia‚Äôs 2023 Crypto Mining Legalization This decision follows Russia‚Äôs move in November 2023 to legalize cryptocurrency mining. Under this new framework, miners are required to register with the Federal Tax Service, providing detailed information about their assets and wallet addresses. Individual miners are allowed to mine up to 6,000 kWh per month, ensuring they follow Russia‚Äôs energy policies. Balancing Crypto Innovation By imposing these restrictions, Russia aims to balance the energy needs of its industries with the desire to regulate cryptocurrency mining. The measures show the government‚Äôs effort to integrate crypto mining into the economy responsibly, while maintaining a stable energy supply.

Convicted in November 2023 on seven charges, SBF‚Äôs potential clemency has sparked widespread debate, especially given his political connections. SBF‚Äôs ties to the Democratic Party have fueled these rumors. During the 2020 election cycle, he donated $5.2 million to pro-Biden super PACs, making him the second-largest individual donor after Michael Bloomberg. Critics argue these contributions might influence the judicial process. Questions about fairness and favoritism arose after Tesla CEO Elon Musk commented on the issue, saying he would be ""shocked"" if SBF isn‚Äôt pardoned. Jason Williams, a vocal critic, added that SBF had used over $100 million in stolen customer funds to finance political campaigns. President Biden‚Äôs recent clemency decisions have also intensified concerns. For instance, Michael Conahan, a judge involved in the infamous ‚Äúkids-for-cash‚Äù scandal , received clemency in December, alongside 1,500 others. Critics say such actions show a pattern of controversial decisions that may pave the way for leniency in high-profile cases like SBF‚Äôs. Another point of contention lies in the handling of SBF‚Äôs collaborators. Former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison received only a two-year sentence after cooperating with prosecutors, while Gary Wang, who enabled the diversion of $11 billion in customer funds , avoided jail entirely. Observers worry these outcomes could set a precedent, encouraging wrongdoers to cooperate in exchange for lighter punishments. FTX‚Äôs collapse continues to leave lasting effects on creditors and the crypto industry. The company‚Äôs court-approved reorganization plan is scheduled to begin on January 3, 2025. Amid this financial chaos, the possibility of a pardon raises questions about the intersection of political influence and judicial fairness. The debate surrounding SBF‚Äôs potential clemency remains heated, reflecting public frustration over perceived inequality in the legal system and concerns about the precedent such decisions might set for future cases.",NEGATIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,EXCHANGE | REGULATION | RESEARCH,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/speculation-grows-over-possible-pardon-for-ftx-s-sam-bankman-fried,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/38040422.jpeg

38041263,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52993,1735027780,Cryptocurrency Regulation: How New Laws Will Change the Market in 2025,"title: Cryptocurrency Regulation in 2025 description On the regulation of cryptocurrencies in 2025. Told by Holiverse CEO Lado Okhotnikov –ù1 Cryptocurrency Regulation: How New Laws Will Change the Market in 2025 keywords Lado Okhotnikov, Holiverse, regulation The cryptocurrency market remains a battleground for decentralization advocates and regulators. In 2024, the fervor reached its peak: this was facilitated by global economic changes, increased regulatory activity in different countries, as well as the consequences of lawsuits against large cryptocurrency exchanges ‚Äì #FTX and Binance. The cryptocurrency market needs new legislation. We will look at different aspects of this topic to understand how new regulatory laws can change the financial market in 2025. And also get acquainted with the outside opinion on the future of regulators and #DeFi projects. Problems of government regulation of cryptocurrencies One of the main problems of the cryptocurrency industry is the lack of a transparent approach to government regulation of cryptocurrencies at the international level. Different countries take different approaches. Cryptomarket regulation in the USA The US Securities and Exchange Commission considers many cryptocurrencies as securities, which means they are subject to strict financial supervision rules. This has led to many lawsuits related to unregistered ICOs and the sale of tokens without appropriate licenses. As a criterion for assessing cryptocurrency, the regulator chose the Howey test, which was developed by the US Supreme Court in 1946 to determine whether a transaction involving cryptocurrencies is classified as a securities transaction. Critics of this method reasonably note that cryptocurrencies, unlike shares, do not provide the owner with the right to own a share in any company and do not give the right to distribute income from this ownership. The United States is expected to address the issue of cryptocurrency regulation in 2025. The presidential election campaigns have clearly shown how relevant this issue is for millions of citizens. Cryptocurrency regulation in China China has completely banned cryptocurrency transactions, including mining and trading. The ban has not only caused a massive migration of miners to other regions of the world, but has also led to the development of over-the-counter cryptocurrency trading. This has given rise to semi-legal services for exchanging yuan for tokens, bypassing public exchanges. Such transactions resemble peer-to-peer trading, when transactions are carried out directly between participants without the intermediaries. Such transactions are difficult to track, they are ideal for the regime of restrictions on cryptocurrency mining and trading and, of course, are in the ‚Äúshadow‚Äù economy of the country. China is gradually introducing some concessions for the circulation of tokens, however, it is too early to talk about complete freedom. The Celestial Empire has international settlements using cryptocurrencies, and is also developing a new national cryptocurrency pegged to the yuan. But it is not yet known how soon a ready-made solution will appear. Europe and MiCA The European Union has long sought to create uniform standards for regulating cryptocurrencies. But the problem was that many European countries introduced their own laws, which somewhat fragmented the market. Such a variety of approaches made it difficult for international companies and investors to work, as they had to adapt to different legal regimes. In 2025, the EU is expected to finally adopt MiCA ‚Äî the directive on cryptocurrency markets. It will unify the rules for the circulation of cryptocurrencies throughout European countries and will regulate the activities of digital service providers and token issuers. The Directive also sets requirements for licensing, transparency, risk management and corporate governance for crypto companies. Trials against cryptocurrency exchanges In 2024, lawsuits against cryptocurrency platforms developed. The results of the proceedings affected not only the current exchange rates but also the entire industry as a whole, thus demonstrating the imperfection of the current legislation. Binance case The largest cryptocurrency exchange #Binance faced numerous accusations from the regulator in 2024. The exchange was accused of violating the rules of securities trading, money laundering, and insufficient protection of users from fraudulent schemes. Changpeng Zhao, CEO of Binance, stated that many of the accusations are attempts to restrain the development of the crypto market and force the industry to follow old rules that do not take into account the nature of decentralized finance. FTX The bankruptcy of FTX exchange in 2022 was a shock to the entire crypto market. This event was followed by numerous investigations and lawsuits aimed at compensating losses to affected investors. Despite the fact that the founders of the exchange were ready to compensate losses to affected investors, the lack of legislation played a bad joke here: it took a long time before the issue was resolved, since the regulator could not decide in what form the compensation should be received by the affected participants. These examples show how important objective intervention is to ensure fair play in the digital asset market. Without proper control, abuses are possible not only on the part of crypto bankers, but also by irresponsible representatives of the regulator, which threatens trust in cryptocurrencies as a whole. International regulation trends: –ú–µtaverses The development of virtual reality and artificial intelligence poses a new task for the state ‚Äì regulating the activities of metaverses. Now many countries are just beginning to develop a regulatory framework for managing digital worlds. China, for example, licenses the activities of virtual spaces. This is due to the increase in the number of crimes. Cybercriminals quickly adapt to new technologies and find ways to use them to their advantage: this includes phishing ‚Äì gaining access to personal data; and stealing accounts; and many other ways of robbing users and platform owners. Here are some examples that show the vulnerability of virtual spaces to criminals. In July 2024, there was a data leak of users of the Roblox metaverse. Hackers managed to gain access to millions of accounts, including personal messages and purchase history. In early 2022, an incident occurred in the Decentraland metaverse, when an unknown user created a fake NFT project and collected millions of dollars from gullible investors, after which he disappeared. In 2022, a harassment scandal erupted in the Horizon Worlds metaverse: one of the metaverse users faced harassment. Governments and development companies must cooperate to create effective legal and technical protection systems to ensure user safety and maintain trust in new technologies. Lado Okhotnikov, the CEO of Holiverse, on the interaction of government regulators and DeFi projects Lado –ûkhotnikov, the CEO and founder of Holiverse metaverse , noted that only when there are clear and understandable rules it is possible to create an atmosphere of trust and stability necessary for successful business. The industry is ready to cooperate and follow established standards, but only if this cooperation is transparent. Because this is the only way to achieve sustainable development and trust from society. However, in reality, it is unlikely that a fair approach can be achieved. Fears about transparency were confirmed just the other day: #Coinbase General Counsel Paul Grewal announced on the social network X (Twitter) that he received data related to the so-called ‚ÄúOperation Chokepoint 2.0‚Äù. According to him, this is a government campaign aimed at restricting financial access for law-abiding crypto companies in the United States. Meanwhile, Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse has been waging a legal battle with regulators for years, trying to prove that the XRP cryptocurrency is not a security. The dispute has dragged on. Garlinghouse is confident that the truth will prevail, but regulators are not giving up and each new round of proceedings is backed up with new arguments and tons of documents. There are about fifty more such examples. Take at least BitClout, Consensys, Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), and Union Square Ventures, which also faced pressure from regulators. Some had to prove their legitimacy, others had to adapt to suddenly tightened rules. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

In a filing with the SEC , executive chairman Michael Saylor proposed increasing the company‚Äôs authorized Class A shares from 330 million to 10.33 billion, as well as raising the number of authorised preferred shares from 5 million to 1.005 billion. The proposed changes are intended to help MicroStrategy raise capital through equity financing and fixed-income securities to fund its ambitious Bitcoin acquisition strategy. In October 2024, the company unveiled the ambitious three-year $42 billion capital plan, the 21/21 Plan, aimed at raising $21 billion in equity capital and $21 billion through fixed-income instruments, such as debt, convertible notes, and preferred stock to buy Bitcoins. Saylor noted that the proposals would provide the company with more flexibility to raise capital in favourable market conditions. Proposal 1, which aims to increase the number of authorised shares of Class A common stock, gives the company the flexibility to issue common equity or convertible instruments as needed to raise capital based on market conditions. Proposal 2, which seeks to increase the number of authorised shares of preferred stock, allows the company to issue preferred stock with terms set by the Board of Directors. This will expand the types of securities the company can offer under the 21/21 Plan, depending on market conditions. MicroStrategy‚Äôs Bitcoin bet MicroStrategy has been on a Bitcoin-buying spree , with its holdings now totalling 444,262 BTC, worth over $27 billion. The company‚Äôs stockpile increased by an additional 5,262 BTC on Monday, as it continues to make Bitcoin a central part of its strategy. On Monday, MicroStrategy announced the sale of $561 million in common stock to purchase an additional 5,262 Bitcoins at an average price of $106,662 per coin. In the past three weeks, MicroStrategy has purchased a total of 42,162 BTC, worth around $4 billion. The average price paid for the new Bitcoin stash is approximately 12% above the current market levels. MicroStrategy‚Äôs stock slips on Monday MicroStrategy‚Äôs stock has been on a downward trajectory despite its i nclusion in the Nasdaq 100 Index . On Monday, the MSTR stock price corrected by 8.78%, falling to $332 levels. This move has extended its weekly losses to 19% and monthly losses to 17.65%. From its all-time high of $472 in November, the MSTR stock has corrected by 30%. However, it is still up a massive 384% since the beginning of 2024. In pre-market trading on Tuesday, the stock is up around 1.3%. Bitcoin‚Äôs recent speed bump Following last week‚Äôs all-time high of $108,000, Bitcoin has faced increased selling pressure.

Jarrett argues that staking rewards should be considered new property rather than immediate taxable income, challenging the IRS's stance in a fresh lawsuit. The outcome of this legal battle could set a precedent that will significantly affect US crypto investors amid increasing regulatory oversight. In his latest lawsuit , Jarrett seeks a refund of $3,293 in taxes paid on 8,876 Tezos tokens earned through staking. This is not his first legal challenge; in 2022, Jarrett filed a similar lawsuit and ultimately received a refund. However, the case was dismissed without setting a legal precedent, as the government opted to issue the refund before reaching oral arguments. Since then, crypto staking has expanded rapidly , prompting the IRS to revisit its policies. In 2023, the agency issued Revenue Ruling 2023-14, declaring that staking rewards should be counted as part of a taxpayer‚Äôs gross income upon receipt, regardless of whether the tokens are later sold or used. This ruling directly contradicts Jarrett's argument that staking generates new property ‚Äîsomething that should not be taxed until realized as income through a sale. The IRS insists that Jarrett should pay taxes on the tokens at their market value at the time they were received, reinforcing its position that staking does not create new taxable assets. The agency's determination aligns with its broader effort to tighten oversight of cryptocurrency activities. This year, the IRS introduced new reporting forms for crypto earnings, hired blockchain experts, and started employing AI tools to detect tax evasion. While the timeline for resolving this dispute remains unclear, the implications are significant. If Jarrett prevails in court, it would represent a substantial victory for US crypto investors and could reshape how staking rewards are taxed nationwide. On the other hand, if the IRS succeeds, it will solidify its authority to tax staking rewards as immediate income. With crypto staking becoming an increasingly common activity, the outcome of this case will directly affect thousands of US investors . As both parties prepare for legal proceedings, the crypto community watches closely, knowing the verdict could influence future regulations and taxation practices.",NEGATIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/irs-battles-investor-over-crypto-staking-taxes-big-impact-ahead,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/38040233.jpeg

38040149,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=375918,1735027500,"Bitcoin (BTC) Price Volatility, Bullish Dogecoin (DOGE) Predictions, and More: Bits Recap Dec 24","TL;DR Bitcoin (BTC) hit $108K last week but dropped to its current $94K following Jerome Powell‚Äôs comments regarding the Fed‚Äôs interest rate policy for next year. Despite a 20% weekly dip to $0.32, analysts hint at a parabolic rally for Dogecoin (DOGE), though extremely high targets seem far-fetched. Shiba Inu (SHIB) fell 17% in the last seven days but shows signs of strength, with analysts eyeing a 20% rebound if key resistance levels break. BTC‚Äôs Rollercoaster Exactly a week ago, Bitcoin (BTC) made history, reaching a new all-time high of over $108,000. Nonetheless, the peak was short-lived and was followed by a substantial correction. On December 20, the price plummeted below $93K, but a day later, it climbed to almost $100K. The past few days offered another pullback, with BTC falling under $93,000 on December 23 and later rebounding to its current $94,000 (per CoinGecko‚Äôs data). BTC Price, Source: CoinGecko One factor potentially affecting the asset‚Äôs valuation could be the latest FOMC meeting, specifically Jerome Powell‚Äôs comments. While the Chairman of the Federal Reserve announced a 0.25% interest rate cut, he warned that this policy might be paused next year due to rising inflation concerns. He also said the central bank is not permitted to hold BTC , which has arguably put Trump‚Äôs promises of creating a strategic BTC reserve in question. The asset‚Äôs downturn also coincides with massive outflows from the spot BTC ETFs. As CryptoPotato reported , investors have withdrawn almost $1.2 billion from the eleven US-registered financial products, with Fidelity leading the exodus. Despite the bearish outlook, some analysts believe BTC might be gearing up for another significant rally in the near future . X user Ali Martinez said the asset ‚Äústill enjoys positive momentum‚Äù due to the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV), which has been on a downfall lately. Those willing to explore additional price forecasts and check whether now is a good time to hop on the BTC bandwagon can take a look at our dedicated video below: What‚Äôs Next for DOGE‚Äôs Price? The sector‚Äôs latest correction has also negatively affected the biggest meme coin in terms of market capitalization. Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently worth around $0.32, representing a 20% decline on a weekly scale . DOGE Price, Source: CoinGecko Similar to BTC, many market observers believe it may soon return to the green track. Martinez was among those weighing in again, envisioning a massive 12,000% price explosion should history repeat itself. ‚ÄúIn 2017, when Dogecoin began a parabolic run, it surged 212%, retraced 40%, then rallied 5,000%. In 2021, it went up 476%, retraced 56%, then skyrocketed 12,000%. Now, in 2024, DOGE is up 440% and has retraced by 46%. If history repeats, another parabolic rally is on the way,‚Äù he stated. It is worth mentioning that such an exponential price increase would require Dogecoin‚Äôs market cap to skyrocket above $5.5 trillion. As of writing these lines, the entire capitalization of the crypto sector is less than $3.5 trillion, making the forecast quite challenging (to say the least). How‚Äôs SHIB Doing? Dogecoin‚Äôs biggest rival ‚Äì Shiba Inu (SHIB) ‚Äì has underperformed, too . Its valuation tumbled by 17% in the past seven days, while its market cap is currently standing at $13.2 billion. This makes SHIB the 17th-biggest cryptocurrency. SHIB Price, Source: CoinGecko According to the X user Rose Signals Premium, though, the price of the meme coin has been ‚Äúshowing signs of strength.‚Äù The analyst set the $0.00002139 ‚Äì $0.00001939 range as a support zone and $0.00002715 as an initial goal (that would require a 20% spike from the current valuation). $0.00003083 was depicted as an ‚Äúintermediate resistance,‚Äù whereas $0.00003511 was predicted to serve as a ‚Äúmajor resistance.‚Äù The post Bitcoin (BTC) Price Volatility, Bullish Dogecoin (DOGE) Predictions, and More: Bits Recap Dec 24 appeared first on CryptoPotato .",NEUTRAL,BTC | DOGE | SHIB,BTC | DOGE | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,,0,0,Crypto Potato,https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-btc-price-volatility-bullish-dogecoin-doge-predictions-and-more-bits-recap-dec-24/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/38040149.jpeg

The trader Ali Martinez tells his 102,400 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin could plummet more than 24% from its current value if it loses one key support range. The crypto analyst looks at the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) Realized Price Distribution (URPD) model to determine the key support levels. The UTXO keeps track of the number of existing coins that last moved within a given price range. ‚ÄúThe key support zone for Bitcoin now lies between $97,041 and $93,806.

Here‚Äôs What to Expect appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin has had a rough few weeks. After hitting a record high of $108,000, its price has now dropped to $92,442, down 14.5%, leaving many wondering if the long-awaited ‚ÄúSanta Claus rally‚Äù will make its appearance this year. Although Bitcoin has managed a slight recovery to $94,000, it‚Äôs still down more than 11% in the past week. So, with the holiday season approaching, is a rally on the horizon, or are we seeing the start of a bigger downturn? As we enter the final stretch of 2024, all eyes are on Bitcoin‚Äîcould the end of the year hold a surprise. Prepping for the Santa Claus Rally Historically, crypto markets have done well during the holiday season, especially in years before market peaks. For example, 2016 and 2020 saw strong rallies just before crypto prices hit their all-time highs. A study by CoinGecko found that from 2014 to 2023, crypto markets rallied post-Christmas 8 out of 10 years. On average, market caps rose between 0.7% and 11.8% from December 27 to January 2. This has led many to expect a Santa Claus rally this year. Source : Coingecko But not every year plays out like that. In 2021, for example, Bitcoin had already dropped by 26% by ChrisHowever, not every year follows this trend. In 2021, for instance, Bitcoin had already dropped by 26% by Christmas Day and continued to decline throughout 2022. Still, many expect 2025 to be a big year for Bitcoin, following the usual four-year market cycle. Despite the dips, the cyclical nature of crypto markets keeps hope alive. Factors to Watch While Bitcoin‚Äôs recent price drop doesn‚Äôt align with the usual Santa Claus rally, a few upcoming events could stir things up. Around December 27, about $18 billion in Bitcoin and Ether options contracts will expire, which could lead to significant volatility and influence Bitcoin‚Äôs price. Additionally, Bitcoin‚Äôs social sentiment hit its lowest point of the year in late December, which could signal that a recovery is coming. Source : Coingecko Bitcoin‚Äôs performance around Christmas has been unpredictable. Some years, it surged; other years, it fell. But if we look at December as a whole, Bitcoin has generally seen a decent return. In fact, betting on the entire month of December has, on average, been more profitable than focusing just on the Santa Claus rally. High Hopes for December As 2024 comes to a close, all eyes will be on Bitcoin‚Äôs next move. Will it rebound, or will it continue to struggle? There‚Äôs still hope that Bitcoin might surprise us in the final days of December, especially with the expiration of options contracts and a shift in market sentiment.",NEUTRAL,ÏóÜÏùå,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoins-price-drop-and-the-missing-santa-claus-rally-in-2024/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Investors are making several commitments to invest in markets that have the potential to grow in 2025. Bret Kenwell of eToro discusses a survey that was conducted on 1,000 retail investors in the United States. 61% of respondents affirmed that the ‚Äúbull market will persist.‚Äù According to the retail investor beat from eToro, U.S. retail investors ranked Amazon first, with 12% selecting the online retailer. In addition, confidence in AI stocks is also high, with 16% anticipating that they will continue their substantial increase into 2025, while 42% anticipate more incremental increases in their share prices. Analyst Bret Kenwell said, ‚ÄúTech often serves as a leadership group for US stocks, and with mega-cap and AI-related stocks garnering strong momentum as Q4 draws to a close, retail investors are looking for that to continue in 2025. Given how well markets have performed and how well these companies are doing, it‚Äôs no surprise that investors are optimistic.‚Äù eToro ranks the 7 Magnificent According to the survey, the ‚ÄòMagnificent 7‚Äô equities are most likely to increase their investments in 2025. US retail investors ranked Amazon first. Amazon‚Äôs share price has enjoyed a nice boost this holiday season. Tesla came in second with 11%. Elon Musk of Tesla has been making big steps in the AI sector. Being in the new government administration his businesses are expected to do well next year which is inclusive of Tesla . Apple followed closely, with 10% of retail investors rooting for the company. Right behind them is Nvidia, which has 8%. Alphabet and Microsoft stood at 7%, and Meta at 6% made up the rest of the list. Retail investors were generally more cautious when asked about the Magnificent 7‚Äôs overall performance in 2025. Only 16% of them anticipated that they would considerably outperform the market, while 32% believed that they would only slightly outperform. Notably, the data also emphasized gender disparities. Women were more inclined to increase their investments in Amazon in 2025, whereas males preferred Nvidia . Crypto gains more traction than stocks The re-election of Donald Trump, a pro-crypto president, has inspired substantial adjustments in retail investors‚Äô portfolios. 55% of investors have adjusted their strategies. Of those that are planning on adjustments, 66% are increasing their allocation to crypto, a more popular option than US stocks 50%. Bret Kenwell explained that Crypto has done really well. He further pointed out that Bitcoin has doubled its price for two consecutive years. Source: eToro Bret Kenwell asserted, ‚ÄúRetail investors are showing a keen understanding of market dynamics and the implications of the macroeconomic and political environment. Given Donald Trump‚Äôs pro-crypto stance, the preference toward cryptoassets shows investors‚Äô expectation that the crypto rally will persist into the new year.‚Äù On the other hand, 55% of respondents intend to enhance their cash holdings, which continue to be the most frequently held asset class, 79%. Bret Kenwell added, ‚ÄúAt the same time, the increase in cash allocations is a strategic move as having cash available puts investors in a position to take advantage of a pullback in stocks or crypto amid an otherwise solid economic backdrop, highlighting discipline among retail investors.‚Äù Retail sales final stretch of 2024 The Commerce Department reported on Wednesday that U.S. retail sales increased once more last month.

Such huge presale amounts drive investors crazy over a project that has gained so much recognition before going live that it‚Äôs pulling investors from other networks for up to 25x gains. Memecoin Favorite DOGE To Moon or Ground? The future of Dogecoin (DOGE) is up in the air as 2025 draws near, and even its creator, Billy Markus, also known as Shibetoshi Nakamoto, has not offered any solid clues. When a follower asked him about the potential peak of DOGE by the end of December, Markus responded with a characteristically ‚Äúno idea‚Äù GIF, reflecting the memecoin cryptocurrency‚Äôs unpredictability. This sentiment echoes the current market mood, as Dogecoin‚Äôs price trajectory remains highly volatile. It started the year with a big upward trend, surging by an impressive 520% and reaching a high of $0.48. But in the last two weeks, it has taken a 30% dive, which has dampened the market‚Äôs enthusiasm. People are now wondering what‚Äôs in store for the coin. While there was optimism earlier in December, recent corrections have made things more uncertain. Dogecoin Creator Breaks Silence on New Year Forecast If you look at the big picture, it might just be a healthy correction instead of a long-term reversal. On a monthly chart, DOGE gained a whopping 161% in November, followed by a 24% pullback in December. Analysts say this could set the stage for growth in January, but December might still be a bit slow. Right now, Dogecoin is over five times higher than it was at the start of the year, which is why it‚Äôs one of the top cryptocurrencies in 2024. But its wild price swings and the recent dip have left investors and fans feeling a bit unsure about what‚Äôs coming. For now, the future of DOGE in 2025 is anyone‚Äôs guess, with market players torn between hope and caution.

Legacy cryptos Cardano ( ADA ) and Uniswap ( UNI ) have finally begun showing signs of life, so are they set to bounce back in 2025? New token Rollblock (RBLK) whose presale has smashed all bullish expectations. In this article we‚Äôll take a look at the potential of all three for the coming 12 months. Supercharge Your Crypto Portfolio with Presale Sensation Rollblock Rollblock is quickly emerging as a presale sensation, offering investors an exciting and early opportunity to supercharge their portfolios. With its unique blend of utility and huge market potential, Rollblock has already raised $7.5 million in its presale , as seasoned investors and newcomers are taking advantage before it launches. Now in stage 9 of its presale , Rollblock‚Äôs token price has surged over 330% to $0.043, reflecting growing confidence in this exciting new crypto project. Analysts have been bullish since it launched, and with the potential to deliver exponential returns in the upcoming bull run, Rollblock might turn out to be one of the leaders of this cycle. One of Rollblock‚Äôs standout features is its Revenue Sharing Model, which ensures token holders earn a share of a percentage of the casino‚Äôs revenues. This gives investors a steady return on their holdings, and backed by a Buyback and Burn mechanism, which reduces token supply over time, this should drive potential price appreciation in the token. With over 7,000 games, transparency, and deflationary tokenomics, Rollblock has the $500 billion online gambling industry worried. For investors looking to diversify their portfolios, Rollblock offers an opportunity to gain exposure to this exciting crypto before it launches its mainnet, and best of all before the 2025 bull run really takes off. Cardano Looking Bullish for 2025, Can it Compete with Ethereum? Cardano is showing long-term bullish potential, with several analysts predicting a bullish 2025. Its innovative proof-of-stake model and scalability solutions position it as a strong contender, and the recent Hydra upgrade promises to enhance transaction speeds, making Cardano more attractive for dApp developers. Can it compete with Ethereum? Well, that remains challenging due to Ethereum‚Äôs dominance and vast developer network, but Cardano offers an energy-efficient and scalable alternative, and this could reinvigorate the once written off Cardano . Can Uniswap Bounce Back for the 2025 Bull Run? Uniswap ‚Äôs latest updates, including its groundbreaking version 4, means it could make a strong return in time for the 2025 bull run . Uniswap ‚Äòs new customizable hooks feature allows developers to create tailored liquidity pools, optimizing capital use and broadening trading opportunities, marking significant development from its earlier models. Uniswap also boasts a new dynamic fee model, which adjusts fees based on market conditions, which should increase profitability for traders. It‚Äôs exciting times for Uniswap and its users if it can attract them back of course. Conclusion The bull run is positioning itself nicely and positioning yourself with promising cryptos now could have a dramatic effect on your earnings. New presale token Rollblock is very exciting, given that it smashed all early bullish expectations. As for Cardano and Uniswap , both have finally seen some updates that should positively affect the networks, but is it too little too late for both? Only time will tell.

Although Bitcoin (BTC) price briefly rallied to $96k, the lack of sufficient bullish sentiment resulted in a sudden retracement to trade at about $94k on Tuesday, December 24 during the early European session. The altcoin industry registered higher gains as more investors continued to anticipate a major parabolic rally in the first half of 2025.

However, exchanges like OKX and Bybit, withdrew their applications without explaining the reason for doing so. Due to its cautionary approach, Hong Kong allows only the most liquid cryptocurrencies for trading, such as Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ), and restricts trading in smaller, more volatile tokens. Bloomberg says another factor that is limiting Hong Kong‚Äôs ability to stay competitive in the space is the influence of China, where crypto trading is banned. Hong Kong‚Äôs special relationship with China gives it a different risk profile compared to other countries, says David Rogers, regional chief executive at market maker B2C2. Per Rogers, Singapore‚Äôs supportive environment makes it a ‚Äúsafe, long-term choice‚Äù for a regional hub.

According to data from SosSoValue, the 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $226.56 million in inflows on Dec. 23 exterior their streak of outflows to three days that saw over $1.18 billion leave the funds. The majority of outflows were seen from Fidelity‚Äôs FBTC which logged outflows of $145.97 million while Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC followed with $38.39 million withdrawn from the fund. Other BTC ETFs that recorded a negative flow are as follows: Invesco Galaxy‚Äôs BTCO, $25.56 million. Bitwise‚Äôs BITB, $23.75 million. ARK and 21Shares‚Äôs ARKB, $15.75 million. Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust, $6.18 million. VanEck‚Äôs HODL, $2.62 million.

The daily trading volume for these investment products stood at $3.52 billion on Dec. 23 lower than the $4.09 billion seen the previous day. When writing, total net inflows into the BTC ETFs stood at $35.83 billion. Meanwhile, the significant outflows recorded on Monday followed Bitcoin‚Äôs ( BTC ) 4% decline from an intraday high of $96,386 to an intraday low of around $92,600 today, driven by a hawkish stance accompanying the Federal Reserve‚Äôs latest interest rate decision. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve implemented its third consecutive interest-rate cut but hinted at a slower pace of monetary easing next year to manage inflation. The move tempered the speculative enthusiasm in the crypto market, which had been fueled by Trump‚Äôs promise of crypto-friendly regulations and his support for establishing a national Bitcoin reserve.

Meanwhile, the SEC is inviting public feedback to finalize the regulations, which focus on making crypto activities safer and more transparent. Aiming for Transparency and Security The proposed CASP Rules define crypto-assets as digital representations of value powered by distributed ledger technology. However, these rules aim to regulate trading, custody, public offerings, and marketing activities associated with cryptocurrencies. Service providers are required to register with the SEC and obtain necessary licenses, ensuring compliance with the Financial Products and Services Consumer Protection Act (FCPA). For public offerings, companies must submit detailed disclosure documents to the SEC at least 30 days before marketing. These documents should clearly explain the offeror‚Äôs background, the technology behind the crypto asset, potential risks, and possible loss of value. Focus on Cybersecurity and Fraud Prevention The draft rule highlights the importance of robust cybersecurity and anti-money laundering measures. Service providers must align with the National Cybersecurity Plan and undergo regular system audits to stay ahead of new threats. The proposed framework also includes Strict rules to prevent insider trading, market manipulation, and fraudulent practices. Public Feedback to Finalize Proposal On the other hand, the SEC is encouraging stakeholders to share their thoughts on the feedback by January 18, 2025. This approach aims to ensure that the regulations are fair, effective, and beneficial for the crypto industry. Philippine‚Äôs Growing Crypto Demand With a young and tech-savvy population, at an average age of 25.3 years, the Philippines is a global leader in cryptocurrency adoption. With over 562 million people worldwide now using crypto-assets, the need for strong regulatory measures to tackle risks like fraud and market manipulation has become increasingly important.

Bonk Coin (BONK): Community Powerhouse on Solana If there‚Äôs one thing that keeps meme coins alive and kicking, it‚Äôs their communities, and Bonk Coin is a masterclass in leveraging people‚Äôs power. Launched on the Solana blockchain, BONK made waves with airdrops that fuelled its initial popularity. Its decentralised distribution model ensures that it stays true to its roots, focusing on community growth rather than whale control. Recently, Bonk Coin has been riding the rollercoaster of meme coin volatility. After an explosive start, it faced the usual challenges of speculative assets, but its listing on Robinhood brought a renewed sense of legitimacy and accessibility. The coin‚Äôs massive 100 trillion supply might seem overwhelming, but it‚Äôs this abundance that allows for staking rewards and partnerships aimed at expanding its reach. The big question: can Bonk sustain its momentum into 2025? With its strong community and ongoing exchange listings, the potential is there. However, investors should keep an eye on broader market trends and remember that meme coins thrive on hype cycles. As it stands, Bonk remains a solid choice for those looking to tap into a community-driven project with a proven track record of engaging its base.

Despite a challenging month, with its price dropping by 39.02%, WIF has shown resilience over the past six months, gaining 19.71%. These numbers suggest a coin that‚Äôs finding its footing amidst the chaos. Key technical metrics make WIF particularly intriguing. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently sits at 28.61, signalling that the coin is oversold and ripe for a potential rebound. With a support level at $1.91 and resistance at $4.19, traders are eyeing a possible bounce back that could yield substantial gains. Additionally, the MACD indicates waning bearish momentum, while the moving averages hint at a momentum shift if short-term trends align. But WIF isn‚Äôt just about charts and numbers. Its unique branding and community-driven initiatives give it a cultural edge, making it a standout in the meme coin space. For investors willing to ride the wave of speculative assets, WIF offers a compelling mix of technical promise and meme magic.

The crypto market may have bottomed out, and that means one thing ‚Äì it‚Äôs only up from here. The renewed optimism has sparked projections of a massive resurgence for Bitcoin, SUI, and the new crypto sensation, Rollblock. Bitcoin has remained resilient with better institutional interest, while SUI has maintained its status as one of the top performers this year. Meanwhile, Rollblock‚Äôs innovative GambleFi protocol , multimillion-dollar presale growth, and unique iGaming solution have captivated investors. Could these promising tokens send the crypto market to a new ATH? Let‚Äôs find out. Rollblock: The New Crypto GambleFi Innovator Poised For Explosive Growth While the crypto market gets a breather from the recent rally, the new crypto Rollblock is rapidly emerging as a transformative player in the $500 billion global gaming industry. Rollblock, combining blockchain technology with practical Web3 applications to deliver unmatched value, has fueled its presale success. Rollblock seamlessly integrates with a robust ecosystem of over 7,000 games, live casino platforms, and sports betting features. Secured by Ethereum-backed smart contracts, the platform ensures transparency, security, and trust. What sets Rollblock apart is its deflationary tokenomics model. The project reduces token supply through regular buybacks, token burns, and staking rewards while incentivizing long-term holding. With its innovative ecosystem and a presale that‚Äôs already turning heads, Rollblock is not just a GambleFi pioneer‚Äîit‚Äôs a project poised to redefine the Bitcoin Drops 10%, But Vaneck‚Äôs $180k Ath Prediction Fuels Optimism. After reaching a historic ATH of $108,000 last week, Bitcoin has tumbled 10% below $93k after the massive selloff that followed the Federal Reserve‚Äôs announcement that fewer interest rate cuts are expected in 2025. But as the near pressure cools, Bitcoin has emerged as many forward-thinking investors‚Äô favorite for the crypto rally. The optimism surrounding Trump‚Äôs reelection and the US political shift has positioned Bitcoin as one of the US‚Äôs financial arsenal. That alone can potentially drive unprecedented demands that push Bitcoin back above ATH. VanEck‚Äôs bullish projection of Bitcoin hitting $180,000 by 2025 adds to the intrigue. Experts call it ambitious, but Glassnode‚Äôs Bitcoin analysis suggests it may mirror past trends. Sui Slides Below $5. Can Ecosystem Development Push Price Up? SUI is another crypto predicted to ride the wave of enthusiasm in the crypto market. For weeks, SUI has been toeing BTC‚Äôs line and touched an ATH of $4.82 last week after surging 24% MoM. Although SUI saw a short-term pullback, its 2024 813% growth has been amazing. It‚Äôs not wild to think SUI can continue the impression uptick. Key ecosystem developments, including its cross-chain USDC transfer protocol launch and the recent Grayscale SUI Trust launch, have shone more light on its potential on and off the chart. Technical indicators are even stronger‚Äîanalysts think SUI can trigger a near-term run to $7.7. Conclusion After hitting rock bottom, the crypto market is gradually finding its footing. Bitcoin‚Äôs resilience, bolstered by bullish predictions, hints at a possible new ATH, while Sui‚Äôs continued ecosystem development fuels optimism for further gains. However, it‚Äôs the new crypto casino Rollblock that stands out. Its groundbreaking GambleFi protocol and innovative gaming solutions have propelled its ongoing presale by 330%.

42389952,8d60ace8-5cc8-4d5b-8bc4-8da05a3f6c4b,1735023942,Record $14B Bitcoin Options Expiry Looms as Market Looks Highly Levered-Up,"Just when you thought the year-end couldn't get any more intriguing, a significant options expiry is set to shake things up in this highly levered-up market.  Options are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right to buy or sell the underlying asset at a preset price at a later date. A call gives the right to buy, and a put confers the right to sell.  On Friday at 8:00 UTC, 146,000 bitcoin options contracts, valued at nearly $14 billion and sized at one BTC each, will expire on the crypto exchange Deribit. The notional amount represents 44% of the total open interest for all BTC options across different maturities, marking the largest expiry event ever on Deribit.   ETH options worth $3.84 billion will expire as well. ETH has dropped nearly 12% to $3,400 since the Fed meeting. Deribit accounts for over 80% of the global crypto options market.   Significant OI to expire ITM  As of writing, Friday's settlement looked set to see $4 billion worth of BTC options, representing 28% of the total open interest of $14 billion, expire ""in the money (ITM),"" generating a profit for buyers. These positions may be squared off or rolled over (shifted) to the next expiry, potentially causing market volatility.  ""I suspect a fair bit of open interest in BTC and ETH will be rolled into Jan. 31 and Mar. 28 expiries as the nearest liquidity anchors at the start of the new year,"" Simranjeet Singh, portfolio manager and trader, at GSR said.  It should also be noted that the put-call open interest ratio for Friday's expiry is 0.69, meaning seven put options are open for every 10 calls outstanding. A relatively higher open interest in calls, which provides an asymmetric upside to the buyer, indicates that leverage is skewed to the upside.  The issue, however, is that BTC's bullish momentum has run out of steam since last Wednesday's Fed decision, where Chairman Jerome Powell ruled out potential Fed purchases of the cryptocurrency while signaling fewer rate cuts for 2025.   BTC has since dropped over 10% to $95,000, according to CoinDesk indices data.  This means that traders with leveraged bullish bets are at risk of magnified losses. If they decide to throw in the towel and exit their positions, it could lead to more volatility.  ""The previously dominant bullish momentum has stalled, leaving the market highly leveraged to the upside. This positioning increases the risk of a rapid snowball effect if a significant downside move occurs,"" Deribit's Chief Executive Officer Luuk Strijers told CoinDesk.  ""All eyes are on this expiry, as it has the potential to shape the narrative heading into the new year,"" Strijers added.  Directional uncertainty lingers  Key options-based metrics show there‚Äôs a noticeable lack of clarity in the market regarding potential price movements as the record expiry nears.  ""The much-anticipated annual expiry is poised to conclude a remarkable year for the bulls. However, directional uncertainty lingers, highlighted by heightened volatility of volatility (vol-of-vol),"" Strijers said.  The volatility of volatility (vol-of-vol) is a measure of fluctuations in the volatility of an asset. In other words, it measures how much the volatility or the degree of price turbulence in the asset itself fluctuates. If an asset's volatility changes significantly over time, it has a high vol-of-vol.  A high vol-of-vol typically means increased sensitivity to news and economic data, leading to rapid changes in asset prices, necessitating aggressive position adjustment and hedging.  Market more bearish on ETH  How options due for expiry are currently priced reveals a more bearish outlook for ETH relative to BTC.  ""Comparing the vol smiles of the [Friday's] expiration between today and yesterday, we see that BTC‚Äôs smile is almost unmoved, while ETH's implied vol of calls has dropped significantly,"" Andrew Melville, research analyst at Block Scholes.  A volatility smile is a graphical representation of the implied volatility of options with the same expiration date but different strike prices. The drop in implied volatility for ETH calls means decreased demand for bullish bets, indicating a subdued outlook for Ethereum's native token.  That's also evident from the options skew, which measures how much investors are willing to pay for calls offering an asymmetric upside potential versus puts.  ""After more than a week of poorer spot performance, ETH‚Äôs put-call skew ratio is more strongly bearish (2.06% in favour of puts compared to a more neutral 1.64% towards calls for BTC),"" Melville noted.  Overall, end-of-year positioning reflects a moderately less bullish picture than we saw going into December, but even more starkly for ETH than BTC,"" Melville added.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/12/24/record-14-b-bitcoin-options-expiry-looms-as-market-looks-highly-levered-up,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fd2c6a5d819faf4a715b58c1bf662bc8d5377d48-2128x909.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Currently, when DeFi protocols use price oracles, such as during liquidations, value is captured by third parties, including searchers and validators. None of this value returns to the protocols or oracles that created these opportunities, however. The solution is SVR, which allows DeFi lending protocol apps to recapture some of this value from liquidations. Chainlink expects to recapture about 40% of the value that would normally be lost. MEV is the profit that can be made by strategically ordering, including, or excluding transactions within a blockchain block.

It also includes a fallback mechanism for safety using standard price feeds and requires minimal changes for protocols already using Chainlink oracles. SVR will generally split captured value at 60% to DeFi protocols and 40% to Chainlink; however, under a special launch partner deal with Aave, it will split it 65:35 for the first six months. Chainlink community ambassador Zach Rynes, aka ‚ÄòChainLinkGod,‚Äô said it was a very bullish development, adding: ‚ÄúLiquidation MEV in DeFi is measured in the tens of millions of dollars per year, presenting a significant economic opportunity for both communities.‚Äù He continued to state that SVR is also planned to be one of the first Chainlink services to plug into the Payment Abstraction system, ‚Äúenabling the Chainlink Network share of the split to be converted into LINK using existing DEXs.‚Äù Very bullish development for $LINK and $AAVE with the introduction of @Chainlink ‚Äôs new non-toxic MEV recapture solution Chainlink SVR (Smart Value Recapture)‚Äîdesigned to recapture liquidation MEV in DeFi‚Äîwill feature a revenue split between integrating DeFi protocols and the‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/sSTabhrH8c ‚Äî Zach Rynes | CLG (@ChainLinkGod) December 23, 2024 LINK Price Reaction Chainlink‚Äôs native token, LINK , was boosted around 9% by the announcement, climbing from just over $22 to reach an intraday high of $24.78.

The cryptocurrency has experienced a significant increase in 2024, with a gain of over 258% since the start of the year. XRP‚Äôs price had risen significantly from its low of $0.22 in early 2021 to approximately $2.30 as of mid-December. XRP has now surpassed stablecoin Tether (USDT) to become the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a testament to its extraordinary growth.

She contends that digital assets are poised to revolutionize asset tokenization and money, much like the internet transformed communication. An excerpt from my weekly newsletter today: Digital assets should outperform tech stocks like the Magnificent 7 (Apple, Alphabet, Google, Tesla, Meta, Amazon and Nvidia) by possibly as much as 10x, in my opinion.

Jones (@LindaPJones) December 19, 2024 Investors who are prepared to adopt this emergent asset class may capitalize on substantial growth prospects as a result of this transformation. Jones emphasizes that digital assets have historically been the most successful asset class, with Bitcoin experiencing nearly 30,000% increase over the past decade and XRP following closely behind with a 35,000% increase during the same period. Unexploited Market Potential The current low adoption rate of digital assets is one of Jones‚Äôs most compelling arguments. She observes that only 5% of individuals worldwide have invested in cryptocurrencies, indicating a vast untapped market that is awaiting development. Retail investors are currently better positioned than institutional players since they cannot fully enter the market because of regulatory barriers. However, Jones expects that institutional capital will soon flood the market in response to the expected regulations on crypto and stablecoins by early 2025. The recent proposal by US President-elect Donald Trump to exempt capital gains on digital assets situated in the United States from taxation serves to bolster this optimism. This policy has the potential to substantially increase the potential of American projects such as XRP and Cardano (ADA) by redirecting investments toward them if it is implemented.

These developments point to a growing integration of digital assets into diverse industries, signaling increasing demand for alternative payment methods and long-term confidence in Bitcoin as a strategic investment. While La Rosa seeks to enhance its operational offerings, MicroStrategy remains committed to its aggressive accumulation strategy, even as market dynamics evolve. MicroStrategy‚Äôs Bitcoin Buying Spree Continues Amid Speculation of Future Market Moves Corporate Bitcoin investor MicroStrategy has once again demonstrated its unwavering commitment to Bitcoin, purchasing 5,262 BTC between Dec. 16 and 22, 2024. The acquisition, worth approximately $561 million, comes amid founder Michael Saylor‚Äôs pledge to aggressively accumulate the cryptocurrency, even at historically high prices. The latest purchase, officially announced on Dec. 23, sets a record for MicroStrategy in terms of acquisition cost. The company acquired Bitcoin at an average price of roughly $106,662 per BTC ‚Äî the highest price it has paid for the asset to date. As of Dec. 22, MicroStrategy and its subsidiaries held a staggering 444,262 BTC. This hoard, acquired at an aggregate purchase price of $27.7 billion, brings the company's average acquisition cost to $62,257 per BTC, according to company disclosures. The latest purchase is part of a broader buying spree that has seen MicroStrategy significantly expand its Bitcoin holdings throughout December. Over the past three weeks, the firm has purchased a total of 42,162 BTC, worth approximately $4 billion at current market prices. However, the most recent acquisition accounts for just 12% of its total December accumulations, marking a noticeable slowdown. This deceleration comes after larger transactions earlier in the month, including a purchase of 24,540 BTC announced on Dec. 9. By contrast, the 5,262 BTC bought last week represents the smallest publicly disclosed acquisition by MicroStrategy since mid-2024, when the company purchased just 169 BTC during June and July. Speculation on Future Buying Strategies The slowdown has sparked speculation about MicroStrategy‚Äôs future Bitcoin purchasing strategy, with some market watchers questioning whether the company might pause its acquisitions in 2025. These rumors gained traction following comments from BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, who warned of potential market volatility tied to the upcoming inauguration of US President-elect Donald Trump. Hayes suggested that Bitcoin prices could face downward pressure in early 2025, prompting his investment fund, Maelstrom, to clear some positions in anticipation of buying at lower prices. Adding to the uncertainty, some observers have pointed to a potential ‚Äùblackout period‚Äù for MicroStrategy in January 2025. If true, this would halt the company‚Äôs ability to issue shares or convertible bonds to fund additional Bitcoin purchases. Despite these rumors, MicroStrategy‚Äôs founder remains resolute in his bullish outlook. In early December, Michael Saylor reaffirmed his long-term commitment to Bitcoin, stating, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure that I will be buying Bitcoin at $1 million a coin ‚Äî probably $1 billion dollars a day of Bitcoin at $1 million a coin.‚Äù MicroStrategy‚Äôs strategy has not only positioned the company as a major player in the Bitcoin market but has also influenced how other corporations and institutions view cryptocurrency as a treasury asset. The company‚Äôs continued accumulation, even at peak prices, demonstrates its belief in Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term potential. However, the evolving macroeconomic landscape, combined with political and regulatory uncertainties, could test MicroStrategy‚Äôs resolve. The possibility of a temporary halt in purchases or a broader market correction could impact both Bitcoin prices and the overall sentiment in the cryptocurrency market. As 2024 draws to a close, MicroStrategy‚Äôs latest Bitcoin acquisition reaffirms its status as one of the most aggressive corporate investors in the cryptocurrency space. While the firm‚Äôs December buying spree has slowed, its founder‚Äôs unwavering belief in Bitcoin suggests that MicroStrategy is far from finished with its purchasing strategy. Whether the rumored ‚Äúblackout period‚Äù materializes or not, the company‚Äôs actions will undoubtedly remain a focal point for Bitcoin investors heading into 2025. La Rosa Holdings Embraces Bitcoin: Cryptocurrency Payments Now Available for Real Estate Agents In related news, Nasdaq-listed La Rosa Holdings has made a significant leap into the world of cryptocurrency, announcing on Dec. 23 that it will integrate Bitcoin and digital asset payment options for its extensive network of over 3,000 real estate agents across the United States. This innovative move positions the real estate company at the forefront of blockchain adoption in the property sector, offering agents the option to receive commissions in cryptocurrencies. La Rosa Holdings, through its real estate platform La Rosa Realty, aims to streamline how agents manage their business processes, including buying and selling properties and communicating with clients. By introducing cryptocurrency payment options, the company responds to what it calls a ‚Äúgrowing demand for alternative payment methods among agents and clients alike.‚Äù Agents using La Rosa Realty can now choose to receive their commissions in Bitcoin or other digital assets. Additionally, this initiative includes a 2% fee for agents opting for cryptocurrency payments, potentially opening up a new revenue stream for the company. CEO Joe La Rosa expressed optimism about the integration, stating, ‚ÄúThis initiative may potentially create a new revenue stream for La Rosa.‚Äù A Booming Year for La Rosa Holdings The cryptocurrency initiative follows a strong financial year for La Rosa Holdings. The company reported a remarkable 155% year-over-year increase in revenue for the first nine months of 2024, reaching $51.7 million. La Rosa Realty offers agents flexible payment models, including a 100% commission plan and a revenue-sharing model. These competitive structures, combined with the new cryptocurrency payment options, are expected to attract tech-savvy agents and clients seeking cutting-edge solutions in the real estate market. La Rosa Holdings joins a growing list of companies integrating Bitcoin and cryptocurrency payment systems into their operations. Major global brands such as PayPal, Microsoft, Starbucks, and McDonald‚Äôs have already embraced Bitcoin payments. This trend is part of a broader movement toward digital asset adoption, with the Bitcoin payment ecosystem forecasted to reach a staggering $1.83 trillion in value by 2030. This includes contributions from miners, merchants, and consumers driving the adoption of cryptocurrency in everyday transactions. La Rosa Holdings is not the only publicly traded company diving deeper into the cryptocurrency space. Other firms have begun exploring digital asset strategies to enhance their balance sheets. On Dec. 20, Quantum BioPharma, a biopharmaceutical company, announced the purchase of $1 million in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, demonstrating the growing appeal of digital assets as a hedge against traditional financial systems. On Dec. 22, Japanese investment firm Metaplanet made headlines with its largest-ever Bitcoin purchase, acquiring nearly 620 BTC in a single transaction. The Road Ahead for La Rosa Holdings As La Rosa Holdings implements its cryptocurrency payment system, the company is well-positioned to leverage the growing popularity of digital assets among younger, tech-savvy homebuyers and real estate agents. By incorporating Bitcoin and other digital assets into its operations, La Rosa is setting a precedent for other firms in the real estate sector to follow. The integration of cryptocurrency payments could also help La Rosa appeal to international clients, many of whom prefer the ease and speed of Bitcoin transactions for cross-border payments. La Rosa Holdings‚Äô decision to integrate Bitcoin payments is indicative of the increasing relevance of cryptocurrencies in mainstream industries.

38038017,https://coinpedia.org/?p=396928,1735023482,"Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction: XRP to Rocket Past $5, But Not Before This Bullish Rival Priced at $0.15","The post Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction: XRP to Rocket Past $5, But Not Before This Bullish Rival Priced at $0.15 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The cryptocurrency market is highly dynamic, and Ripple (XRP) is not left behind. Most of the time, they are the ones that enable cost-effective and speedy cross border payments.‚ÄôAnalysts are predicting an all-time high price surge to over $5, making the trading price of $2.40 a potential entry point for investors. However, before XRP can achieve this feat, a new player, Rexas Finance (RXS), currently at a modest $0.15, is making waves with its bullish predictions. Rexas Finance has already raised $29 million from its $33.1 million goal and sold 355,692,901 out of 380,000,000 tokens in its presale, showcasing immense investor interest. This article will compare the trajectories of both projects, focusing on their market dynamics, security measures, and community engagement strategies, such as giveaways. Ripple‚Äôs Path to $5 Ripple (XRP) came to be within the cryptocurrency space ahead of other coins because of its use in cross-border banking transfers. One of the most influential triggers was finding a reasonable solution for the legal dispute with the SEC, which resulted in the appreciation of the XRP. The expectation of XRP reaching $5 is greatly supported by the existing technology, in this case, RippleNet. Many financial institutions recently adopted it to help them save costs and time on transactions. Still, they have a challenging road ahead. XRP will have to deal with price fluctuations, differing regulations, and competition from other blockchain payment solutions. The broader acceptance of cryptocurrencies in traditional finance could significantly influence XRP‚Äôs trajectory, potentially surpassing the $5 mark if regulatory clarity improves. Rexas Finance (RXS): The Bullish Rival at $0.15 Rexas Finance (RXS) stands out by combining crypto with real-world assets since it is one of the few companies specializing in asset tokenization. As it launched at $0.15, RXS is rapidly making the wave with its affordable and investment-oriented ecosystem. Having raised nearly $30 million, its presale success underscores the market‚Äôs faith in its vision. Tools like the Rexas Token Builder simplify asset tokenization, while the Rexas AI Shield enhances platform security, making it an attractive option for novice and seasoned investors. The appeal of RXS is further amplified by its community engagement through the $1 Million Giveaway, where 20 winners each receive $50,000 worth of RXS tokens . This initiative has increased visibility and community participation, with over 463,820 entries, highlighting Rexas Finance‚Äôs community-building prowess. Analysts are particularly optimistic about RXS, predicting a potential rise to $5 in the near term, which could offer returns far exceeding XRP‚Äôs anticipated growth. Security and Community Engagement: The Competitive Edge Though their approaches differ, security is a cornerstone for both XRP and RXS. Ripple‚Äôs blockchain has been secure by design, with years of operational history to prove its robustness against cyber threats. The recent legal victories have also cleared up some regulatory clouds, potentially enhancing institutional trust in XRP. Rexas Finance, on the other hand, has taken proactive steps to ensure security from the outset. The project underwent a Certik audit, which, while identifying some centralization issues, provided a solid foundation for investor confidence. The Rexas AI Shield adds another layer of security, using AI to monitor and protect smart contracts. It makes a compelling choice for those concerned about the safety of their investments in tokenized assets. Rexas Finance‚Äôs community giveaway fosters a sense of community and serves as a marketing tool, drawing more attention to the project. Combining security with community rewards could be pivotal in distinguishing RXS in the crowded crypto market, potentially leading to quicker adoption and higher price appreciation than XRP‚Äôs traditional approach. Youtube Embed AI Predicts $RXS Will Hit $7 by 2025: Ethereum Whales Are Bullish on Rexas Finance (RXS) Conclusion While Ripple (XRP) continues its journey towards a $5 valuation, bolstered by its established use cases and regulatory progress, Rexas Finance (RXS) at $0.15 is poised to disrupt with its innovative take on asset tokenization. The combination of Rexas Finance‚Äôs successful presale, focus on security, and engaging community strategies like the giveaway positions it as a high-potential investment that might outstrip XRP‚Äôs growth in the short term. Investors are thus presented with a choice between a well-established player with a clear path forward and a newcomer with explosive growth potential.

38039290,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52988,1735023390,Analyst Says XRP Actual Breakout Starts At $20,"XRP has remained a focal point in cryptocurrency discussions, and its recent performance suggests that the digital asset may be on the verge of a significant breakout. Amonyx (@amonbuy), a well-known analyst on X, has shared a compelling analysis of XRP‚Äôs historical price performance compared to Bitcoin, highlighting its unique behavior and potential for substantial gains in this market cycle. REMEMBER: THE BREAKOUT HASN'T EVEN STARTED YET. #XRP IT WILL GO CRAZY ABOVE $20+. pic.twitter.com/h6zWHzNEFK ‚Äî Amonyx (@amonbuy) December 22, 2024 XRP Keeping Pace With Bitcoin Amonyx‚Äôs chart shows that XRP has consistently kept pace with Bitcoin, often outperforming it during key phases of its price cycles. Amonyx‚Äôs analysis also points to a distinct pattern in XRP‚Äôs price movement. While Bitcoin experiences periods of sustained growth, XRP consolidates before entering a massive upward trend that matches or exceeds Bitcoin‚Äôs performance. This revelation is intriguing, as another well-known analyst recently drew attention to the fact that 1 BTC buys around the same amount of XRP today as it did in 2014. This observation reinforces the notion that XRP has demonstrated a remarkable ability to maintain parity with Bitcoin over the years, even as the broader cryptocurrency market has evolved. XRP‚Äôs Remarkable Performance XRP‚Äôs recent price movement aligns with this historical trend. For the first time since 2018, XRP has traded above $2, reaching a high of $2.86. This milestone marks a significant recovery and renewed optimism among investors. Bitcoin, meanwhile, has also reached a historic milestone, crossing $100,000 and achieving an all-time high of $108,268.45. Bitcoin began climbing much sooner than XRP, reaching a new all-time high in March, and subsequently breaching that level multiple times until it crossed the $100,000 mark toward the end of this year. XRP, on the other hand, failed to sustain meaningful momentum, until a massive price explosion began in November.

Although some community members are doubtful, XRP has shut down all its critics, and is currently one of the best performers in the current cycle, outpacing Bitcoin according to Amonyx‚Äôs chart. At the time of press, XRP is trading at $2.17 and Amonyx believes the current rally could send it above $20. These developments come as XRP attracts attention for its utility and potential to challenge Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance. Some analysts have suggested that XRP may rival or exceed Bitcoin‚Äôs market cap in this cycle. Ben ‚ÄúBitboy‚Äù Armstrong, has already shown how XRP can surpass Ethereum to become the second-largest cryptocurrency. Crossing $20 as Amonyx predicts will help it achieve that goal, and surpassing Bitcoin to become the market leader would be a historic and unrivaled milestone for the digital asset.

There is still hope for the bulls despite correcting by almost 20% in a week. Following the past week‚Äôs drops, which came after witnessing a steady increase for a month and a half, Ethereum saw a notable reduction last week and reset back to the $3.1k level, where it initiated a major surge in November. Surprisingly, that level provided support and the price recovered briefly to a current trading level of $3,350. The bulls are trying to push back but their commitments are not strong enough to bring them back in control. Looking at the price actions from where it initiated a major correction in March, Ethereum appeared to be forming a strong bullish (inverse head and shoulder) pattern on the weekly timeframe. Although the right shoulder pattern is yet to form. A complete formation of this pattern should trigger a massive explosion as soon as the price breaks out of the crucial $4k region ‚Äì a barrier for the bulls in the past months ‚Äì considered as the neckline of the pattern from a macro scale. Currently, trading might look weak on the daily but Ethereum‚Äôs broader outlook remains bullish from a long-term perspective. A drop below last week‚Äôs low could provide more discount for the bulls before bouncing back stronger on a daily scale. ETH‚Äôs Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview Starting the first day of the week a bit strong, Ethereum is now facing the $3,500 level that broke down last week. A daily close above it could allow more recovery to $3,700 and $3,830 before breaking out of the key $4,094 resistance. Aside from $3,255 and the holding $3,100 support, the $3k level is the main support to watch for more breakdowns along with the $2,810 level. Key Resistance Levels: $3,500, $3,830, $4,094 Key Support Levels: $3,255, $3,015, $2,810 Spot Price: $3,340 Trend: Bearish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

MoonPay is reportedly negotiating a $150 million acquisition of Helio Pay to enhance its crypto e-commerce offerings, while Crypto.com launched a U.S. institutional custody service, which is a big step in its North American expansion. Aave Proposes Solution to Address MEV Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Aave is considering the integration of Chainlink's newly released Smart Value Recapture (SVR) oracle to address the issue of maximum extractable value (MEV) in its ecosystem. The proposal was introduced in Aave‚Äôs governance forum, and its main goal is to redirect profits from MEV-related transaction backrunning to benefit the protocol‚Äôs users. This is part of Aave‚Äôs efforts to optimize its operations and reduce the negative impact of MEV. On Dec. 23, Chainlink launched the SVR oracle service that is designed to capture MEV profits and return them back to DeFi protocols. On the same day, Aave proposed leveraging SVR to reclaim MEV from liquidation events and redirect the captured value to the Aave DAO for the benefit of its user base. MEV happens when blockbuilders reorder transactions to maximize profits before finalizing blocks on the blockchain. This often leads to large profits for blockbuilders but can sometimes come at the expense of users. Proposed implementation of Chainlink SVR with Aave v3 on Ethereum (Source: Chainlink ) Aave‚Äôs platform allows users to borrow cryptocurrencies by depositing collateral. If the value of the collateral drops too much, it is liquidated. Liquidations involve third-party liquidators repaying a portion of the debt and receiving the equivalent value in collateral along with a liquidation bonus. While this mechanism worked effectively in the past, the proposal pointed out that it created a clear opportunity for MEV that allows builders to extract profits while contributing minimally to the process. This dynamic has led to disproportionate benefits for blockbuilders compared to protocol users. Chainlink‚Äôs SVR offers a potential solution by selling, through an MEV-Share auction, the rights to back-run Chainlink‚Äôs price-feed oracle and profit from liquidations. Aave estimates that the SVR could capture around 40% of MEV profits, which could then be redistributed in the ecosystem to enhance user benefits. Across the Ethereum network, protocols and users are actively looking for ways to mitigate the costs associated with harmful MEV. One of the main strategies involves using private transactions, where orders are sent directly to validators rather than being included in the public transaction pool. These are known as ‚Äúdark pools,‚Äù and they have gained a lot of popularity as users prioritize MEV protection. According to a report by Blocknative, private transactions now dominate Ethereum‚Äôs order flow. Average block space private vs public (Source: Blocknative ) MoonPay Eyes $150M Acquisition of Helio Pay Aave is not the only crypto company planning major moves. MoonPay, a leading crypto payments firm, is reportedly in discussions to acquire Helio Pay, a crypto e-commerce platform, in a deal valued at close to $150 million. If finalized, this will be MoonPay's largest acquisition to date, according to a report shared by FOX reporter Eleanor Terrett . MoonPay is often referred to as the ‚ÄúPayPal for crypto,‚Äù and offers a robust crypto payments infrastructure. This acquisition could expand its capabilities in the e-commerce sector even more. Helio Pay provides a self-service platform very similar to Coinbase Commerce, allowing over 6,000 e-commerce merchants and content creators to accept payments in Bitcoin, Ethereum, stablecoins like USD Coin, and hundreds of other cryptocurrencies. One of its standout features is its integration with Solana Pay on Shopify, which caters to more than 138 million monthly users. The acquisition will allow MoonPay to enhance its merchant service offerings while still building on its existing user base of approximately 20 million users across over 160 countries. MoonPay‚Äôs services allow users to buy and sell digital assets using debit cards, credit cards, and mobile payment platforms like Apple Pay and Google Pay. The firm recently introduced MoonPay Balance , which is a fiat-to-crypto on-ramp infrastructure that allows users to store and spend fiat balances while interacting more seamlessly with decentralized finance protocols via non-custodial wallets like MetaMask and Phantom. This solution is available in 27 countries, primarily in Europe, though key markets like the United States and Germany were excluded. In July, MoonPay also integrated fiat PayPal on-ramps for customers in the European Union and the United Kingdom, after a similar rollout in the United States earlier. The company was founded in 2018 by Victor Faramond and Ivan Soto-Wright. Crypto.com Launches U.S. Custody Service Meanwhile, Crypto.com launched an institutional crypto custody service in the United States. The move was announced on Dec. 23, and the new service operates under the Crypto.com Custody Trust Company, a chartered trust eligible to hold digital assets for U.S. institutions and high-net-worth individuals. Over the coming weeks, Crypto.com plans to migrate digital assets held by its U.S. and Canadian customers to this custody trust. A crypto custody service securely stores and manages digital assets like cryptocurrencies on behalf of individuals or institutions. These services usually include advanced security measures, regulatory compliance, and insurance coverage to protect assets against theft or loss, making them essential for institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals when it comes to managing their crypto holdings. The move is part of Crypto.com‚Äôs strategic focus on the U.S. and Canada, which the company considers key markets for the crypto industry. CEO Kris Marszalek stated that this step proves the company‚Äôs confidence in the North American market and aligns with its roadmap to strengthen its presence in these important crypto markets. Crypto.com‚Äôs U.S. expansion plans gained serious momentum in December when Marszalek met with President-elect Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago to discuss crypto policies. On the same day, the exchange dropped its lawsuit against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in an effort to collaborate with the incoming administration on a regulatory framework for the industry. Trump has been very vocal about his plans for the U.S. to become a global leader in cryptocurrency and is assembling pro-industry leadership for key regulatory agencies as he prepares to take office in January. Headquartered in Singapore, Crypto.com initially launched in the U.S. in 2022, mainly focusing on institutional investors. After suspending exchange services in the country in 2023, the company since reversed course by acquiring Watchdog Capital, an SEC-registered broker-dealer, in October to bolster its U.S. operations. The launch of Crypto.com‚Äôs custody service happened amid growing competition in the regulated digital asset custody space in the U.S. BitGo also recently introduced a regulated platform for managing native tokens in September, and Fireblocks received regulatory approval from New York‚Äôs financial regulator in August to offer custody services for U.S. clients. Some of the other competitive players in the space include Coinbase Custody Trust, Fidelity Digital Asset Services, and Anchorage Digital NY.",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | LINK,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6700/aave-explores-integration-of-chainlink-oracle-to-tackle-mev,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

Musk the Manipulator (MUSKMANI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKMANI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk the Manipulator can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk the Manipulator could become the next viral memecoin. Musk the Manipulator launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk the Manipulator on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk the Manipulator by entering its contract address ‚Äì DZpfk5LaLrnP6vSFJnLSMAopUuTJGiFk7543rQxh4ids ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKMANI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | SHIB | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/solana-memecoin-musk-the-manipulator-muskmani-to-rally-14000-before-exchange-listings/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

It lost grip again and resumed drops, sitting at a channel‚Äôs lower boundary. The past seven days have been turbulent for Bitcoin, as the price plunged to a two-week low. However, it managed to stay above the $92k level last Friday and recovered. That brought a little relief to the market over the weekend, but the $100k level poses a threat to buyers. It lost momentum again and located support above the $93k level today with a slight increase above $96k in the past hours. Facing a rejection above the level, it lost a thousand ground and now sits at $95.2k. Currently, the bulls are showing interest but there‚Äôs not enough pressure. If they regain control and step back in action, we can expect a new rally above the $100k level. This should sustain bullish momentum in the ascending channel before reaching an extreme overbought condition. Dropping off this channel could trigger a bigger drop in the next few days. If that happens, Bitcoin may test a six-week low before recovering. BTC‚Äôs Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview If Bitcoin respects this channel‚Äôs lower boundary, the price may climb back to the $99,540 level, rejected last weekend. Above it lies a hidden resistance of $106,648 alongside a major $108,353 high before rallying hard to $110k and $115k as expected in the past weeks.

Known as the ‚ÄúInternet of Blockchains,‚Äù Cosmos aims to tackle some of the blockchain industry‚Äôs toughest problems. But here‚Äôs the twist: recent fund movements‚Äîworth millions‚Äîhave people wondering if these financial shifts are fueling a much bigger plan. A Bold Vision for 2025 The Cosmos team isn‚Äôt holding back. They want to make decentralized apps (dApps) easier to build and use, tackling problems like scalability and clunky user experiences. Supported by the Interchain Foundation (ICF) and Interchain Labs, Cosmos is focused on creating a developer-friendly platform that simplifies innovation. https://t.co/ViU9eOuZaD ‚Äî Cosmos ‚Äì The Interchain (@cosmos) December 23, 2024 What‚Äôs on their roadmap? For starters, faster block times and stronger security for the Cosmos Hub. They‚Äôre also upgrading their Cosmos SDK, improving Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC), and introducing an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) solution to connect with Ethereum. These updates aim to make the ecosystem smoother, faster, and more connected. It‚Äôs not just about technology, though. The team is bringing in fresh talent, from engineers to marketing experts, to build a lean, skilled group ready to push Web3 forward. Cosmos is also calling on developers and blockchain enthusiasts to join their mission for a more decentralized future. Big Fund Movements Raise Questions Here‚Äôs where things get interesting. Recently, developers moved a significant amount of assets: 295.3 BTC (worth $27.7 million) and 21,600 ETH. These wallets had been inactive for two years, and suddenly, they‚Äôre moving. Why now? Source : Arkham Source : Arkham Cosmos still holds around $67 million in assets from their ICO back in 2017. The timing of the activity has sparkled speculations if they are gearing up to fund the ambitious 2025 roadmap. Or is there something else cooking behind the scene? The community has split into two opinions. Some think the funds are being reallocated for upcoming developments while the others believe this could signal new strategic partnerships or investment. Either way, the blockchain community is paying attention, curious to see how these financial moves tie into Cosmos‚Äô grand plans. What to Expect Next With 2025 approaching, Cosmos seems to be setting the stage for something significant. Their tech upgrades promise to reshape how decentralized apps are built, and their fund movements add an extra layer of intrigue. Are these steps part of a larger strategy?

Its bullish trajectory remains intact but is yet to regain momentum daily. The early month rejection at $4.4 has caused a notable setback for the bulls in the past two weeks as the price dropped to $2.5 on Thursdays. It temporarily held this price level as support and slightly bounced off. Up until now, the price has remained strong despite facing rejection at the $3 level in the past hours. A daily close above this key level could trigger a fresh increase capable of bringing the bulls back on track. This should activate a break out of the bearish formation on the hourly chart. If that happens, FTT could rally pass the early month rejected level in the coming week. Otherwise, it may continue to maintain the bearish formation, a lower low and lower high pattern, until it finds a solid level. The $1.5 level is considered a key support for a broader recovery on the daily chart. If the price drops well below this level, the bias would turn bearish in the short term before gaining a full recovery. But with the current price actions, FTT will likely resume bullish anytime soon. FTT Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview If the price manages to close this week above $3, the primary resistance level for the bulls is $3.4 along with the monthly $4.4 high.

However, none of the pro-crypto investment managers has so far filed to introduce a Dogecoin ETF to Wall Street investors. According to Nate Geraci, the president of the ETF Store, the absence of a DOGE exchange-traded fund filing is not only a missed financial opportunity but also a marketing mistake for firms that are reluctant to embrace the original meme cryptocurrency. Is A Dogecoin ETF Coming In 2025? Spot Bitcoin ETFs were greenlighted in January of this year, but the first application was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over a decade ago, and the approval process was marked by a lawsuit unleashed by one of the asset managers. Since the SEC later unexpectedly approved spot Ethereum ETFs, several asset managers have sought approval for spot ETFs covering Ripple‚Äôs XRP , Solana‚Äôs SOL , and Litecoin (SOL). But what about the meme coin that was created as a joke in 2013? ETF Store President said he was ‚Äúshocked‚Äù no DOGE ETF applications had been filed yet, even outside the US. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the downside? Worst case, it‚Äôs a marketing expense,‚Äù Geraci noted. ‚ÄúWonder which issuer is sitting on the ‚ÄúDOGE‚Äù ticker.‚Äù Dogecoin has emerged as the leader in the meme coin industry, mainly due to the unwavering support from SpaceX/Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Despite being playful in nature, DOGE has witnessed real use as a peer-to-peer currency. But does the canine-themed meme coin have a serious chance of securing a spot ETF in 2025? The Road Ahead Bloomberg‚Äôs senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas agreed with Geraci, saying he expected several asset managers to have applied to issue DOGE ETFs by Christmas. Nonetheless, he suggested that the inauguration of U.S. president-elect Donald Trump will likely encourage asset managers to submit paperwork for spot Dogecoin ETFs. Furthermore, pro-crypto Paul Atkins officially taking his place as the chairman of the SEC will dramatically increase the chances of DOGE ETF approvals. ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm Vegas my favorite on reserver of $DOGE ticker is Venuto. That said Tuttle is my fav to file for the ETF,‚Äù Balchunas added. https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1870996999782437071 The evolving regulatory landscape could be a boon for potential DOGE ETFs, especially with the United States set to undergo major leadership changes next year.

Bitcoin in a limbo amid Cosmos sell off Large-scale BTC sales should increase market selling pressure, which might send prices lower when demand does not keep up.

Taking a short recovery from last week‚Äôs crash, ADA initiated another drop and broke down to a month low this week. While the latest decline indicates a continuation of the correctional phase, it recovered briefly on Friday but failed to push above the psychological $1 level yesterday. This rejection led to a little price reduction overnight and is now losing momentum again on the daily scale as it faces a minor support level. A continuous breakdown in the price could trigger more losses next week. However, if the bulls regroup well to defend the recent weekly low, the crypto could recover strongly above the psychological level to signal a fresh buying phase capable of skyrocketing the price to a new high.

Since 2016, Ethereum has been the best DeFi development network for new devs, but with Solana‚Äôs recent network reports, the mantle has been hijacked. While Solana now holds up to 7,625 new developers, surpassing Ethereum, analysts are positive that this could further brighten its price sentiment. Meanwhile, a new PayFi network, Remittix (RTX) , just emerged with a ground-breaking approach to simple everyday fiat transactions with a distinct crypto-to-fiat model. Its recently started presale is already pulling in significant interest, showcasing its potential to rise exponentially as a DeFi project. Solana Network Becomes the Biggest Host for New Devs Although the price of Solana (SOL) has been consolidating to lower levels since its last peak price and ATH of $263 on November 23; albeit, it has managed to attract bullish sentiment still. Aside from the SOL token, Solana network is also gaining positive sentiment due to its recent milestone of topping Ethereum as the best blockchain for new developers. According to a recent post made by Solana (SOL) on X (formerly Twitter), the blockchain network was announced by Electric Capital as the number 1 ecosystem for new developers, surpassing Ethereum for the first time ever. Aside from gaining a whopping 7,625 new developers on its network, Solana has become the fastest growing network when its monthly active developers are considered. Meanwhile, this growth represents an 83% YoY rise, surpassing Internet Computer and Base network with 75% and 50%, respectively. While this bolsters Solana‚Äôs dominance in the DeFi market , it also suggests the possibility for SOL token to register a new ATH soon. Likewise, with over 1.7 million unique active wallets, Solana network holds the highest scalability rate‚Äî- seven times more than the next biggest chain. Remittix‚Äôs Expansive Crypto-to-Fiat Payment Features to Disrupt PayFi Market Combining the speed of crypto transactions with the familiarity of fiat currencies, Remittix (RTX) has emerged with the aim of redefining cross-border payments so that cost-effective and seamless everyday transactions can be more accessible. One of the main attributes of this DeFi project is that it offers flat fees while canceling out hidden charges, whether you‚Äôre making large or small-scale transactions. Essentially, the DeFi platform allows users to send over 40 crypto assets which can be remitted in fiat to traditional banks anywhere in the world. Meanwhile, considering its focus on building a trustless platform, Remitiix network has undergone smart contract audit via SolidProof, proving its commitment to enabling secure transactions. These transactions, however, are irreversible. With this, businesses don‚Äôt have to worry about chargebacks. Aside from easy, convenient, fast and secure crypto-to-fiat transactions, where the recipient can‚Äôt even tell that the funds they receive started with a crypto process, Remittix strategically employs stablecoins. This is to mitigate the risk that comes with cryptocurrencies. With all of these robust features, it‚Äôs no wonder why its presale is selling out fast with only $0.015 What Potential Does Remittix Have To Challenge Solana‚Äôs DeFi Dominance?

38037249,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=631557,1735021560,Why These Telegram Gaming Partnerships Are Shooting This Project to 100X,"Breaking records as the first-ever Telegram ICO, the next-generation Telegram gaming platform, Dogizen has already secured significant partnerships that have propelled it to a $2.2m raise in the ongoing presale. But how could these partnerships fuel a potential 100x jump in 2025? Read on to uncover why Telegram gaming looks unstoppable, what Dogizen is, and why a Binance listing could be on the cards. Why Telegram is the future of mobile gaming Mobile gaming has been a growth powerhouse recently, and this trend is set to continue at a rate of 17.1% over the next six years . But while traditional gaming is being disrupted by GameFi‚Äîa sector growing even faster, at a pace of 28.5% CAGR‚Äîthere‚Äôs been little crossover between the two. However, Telegram gaming is driving a shift. Integrated with The Open Network (TON), Telegram has hosted 21% of all Web3 game launches this year , up from 1% in December 2023. This has opened doors to Web3 adoption for an audience of almost one billion. Games like Hamster Kombat, Catizen, and Notcoin have seen player counts skyrocket, reaching at least 300 million, 45 million, and 40 million, respectively. Not surprising when these games offer players the chance to earn crypto in what‚Äôs likely the most frictionless manner available: simply tapping on their phone screen. Coupled with rising retail interest in crypto‚Äîevidenced by the popularity of the Coinbase and Phantom apps in recent weeks‚Äîand a surging market driven by a pro-crypto Trump administration, Telegram gaming could be the entry point for hundreds of millions of new crypto investors. Dogizen and the collaborations that could take it to 100x Leading this charge is Dogizen , a new project that‚Äôs seeing over 1.4 million players in its profitable MVP game. It‚Äôs also making history as the first-ever Telegram ICO, meaning that 950 million Telegram users can buy and claim tokens without ever leaving the app. But that‚Äôs just the beginning. Dogizen is building an entire gaming hub, the Dogizen Universe, that allows game creators to bring new ideas to life through custom SDKs and connect directly with a ready-made audience. Add in staking rewards of 101% APY and revenue-sharing opportunities for token holders, and the potential for DOGIZ is immense. Dogizen has already secured several notable Telegram gaming partnerships that put it in front of a combined audience of at least 5.5 million users. This includes: Grindery , a leading self-custodial EVM-compatible smart wallet with a reach of 1.1 million users SHARKS , a Telegram gaming up-and-comer with a 1.4 million combined reach Secret Launchpad , a prominent Telegram launchpad with 1.4 million users That‚Äôs key when it comes to a possible Binance listing. Several of Dogizen‚Äôs rivals, like Hamster Kombat and Catizen, have listed on the exchange after proving the demand for Telegram gaming and raking in millions in revenue. With its all-in-one ecosystem, Dogizen could be next in line, potentially catalyzing a 100x run. The future of Telegram gaming is Dogizen While 100x sounds extreme, it‚Äôs worth considering that Dogizen will debut with a market cap of just over $10 million. For comparison, Notcoin hit a $2.4 billion market cap in June‚Äîbefore the current bull run really took off. At a $1 billion valuation, DOGIZ would be roughly 100x from its final listing price and even more from its current $0.000077 price. The Telegram gaming revolution starts here and it starts with Dogizen. The Dogizen presale is underway.

Bitcoin surged high to form a new ATH and is currently passive, which suggests the altcoins may take over the rally. However, the popular ones within the top 10 have already initiated a decent rise much before. Now that the technicals have turned bullish for Dogecoin (DOGE) & Solana (SOL), a monstrous rally could be fast approaching. The TD-sequential indicator, used to determine the exact time of trend exhaustion and reversal, is regarded as a powerful tool. This indicator has just flashed a buy signal for both DOGE & SOL, anticipating a price rebound anytime from now. Besides, the Dogecoin price is accumulating within a narrow range, suggesting a strong breakout as selling pressure has dropped considerably. Despite rising upward pressure, the DOGE price remains in an ascending triangle, indicating a bullish pattern. The increase in volume indicates increased trading activity, which may maintain the token‚Äôs volatility. On the other hand, the RSI has triggered a rebound from the lower threshold, while the MACD, which is about to undergo a bullish crossover, validates the bullish claim. Therefore, the Dogecoin price is believed to remain accumulated within the pattern and reach the apex in early 2025, followed by a breakout towards a new ATH. Will Solana (SOL) Price Mark a New ATH in 2025? As mentioned earlier, the indicator has also flashed a bur signal for Solana that points towards a potential trend reversal. After a strong rebound, the price is heading firmly towards $200 and a yearly close above these levels may activate the higher targets above $300. Meanwhile, the interim bearish influence could be a matter of concern, which may prevent the rally from rising above $200. The daily chart of SOL price appears to be bullish as the token has triggered a storm rebound. However, the Ichimoku cloud that turned bearish maintains within the trend, suggesting a bearish reversal could hinder the progress of the rally. Conversely, the MACD shows a drop in the selling pressure and a potential bullish crossover. Until then, the fear of a pullback below $185 could haunt the Solana price rally. The prices of Dogecoin (DOGE) & Solana (SOL) have reached crucial targets and hence a stable rise above their respective resistance could probably revive a strong upswing in the coming days.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SOL,ALTCOIN | DOGE | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/indicator-turns-bullish-for-doge-and-sol-will-the-prices-trigger-a-new-parabolic-wave-to-the-ath/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

If the deal pushes through, the firm is looking to spend about $150 million, which would be the company‚Äôs largest acquisition yet. MoonPay could compete with Coinbase Commerce directly According to Fox Business Journalist, Eleanor Terrett, MoonPay is still negotiating its acquisition of HelioPay for an estimated $150 million. While the specific deal terms have yet to be revealed, some are already speculating that if the Miami-based firm purchases Helio, it could soon rival Coinbase Commerce, a major player in self-service crypto payments. Helio already offers payments in Bitcoin, Ether, and multiple stablecoins to over 6000 e-commerce merchants and content creators, remaining a viable alternative to Coinbase Commerce. It even incorporated Solana Pay on its Shopify platform, which boasts close to 140 million monthly users. If MoonPay manages to acquire Helio, it could augment its crypto service offerings and possibly attract more users to its platform. MoonPay acquired its money transmitter license for its Texas operations Besides its recent negotiations with Helio, MoonPay has been working to broaden its presence in the e-commerce sector. For starters, the firm received its Money Transmitter License from the Texas Department of Banking this month. Now, the fintech company can operate in Texas freely allowing users to buy the 64 different cryptocurrencies on its platform through Venmo and PayPal. The company has even planned to allow its Texas users to sell different cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, and Ethereum by 2025. MoonPay co-founder and CEO Ivan Soto-Wright remarked: MoonPay is committed to prioritizing compliance and consumer protection as we expand crypto accessibility in Texas and beyond. We look forward to continuing our close work with regulatory bodies to bring our crypto solutions to more users around the world. ~ Ivan Soto-Wright On November 13, the Miami-based firm also launched MoonPay Balance, a fiat-to-crypto payment solution. The new payment solution now allows users in the EU or UK to top up in Euro or British Pounds and use it to buy or sell crypto.

Speaking in a video shared by pseudonymous crypto pundit Angry Crypto Show (@angrycryptoshow) on X, Hoskinson highlighted the resilience of Ripple, its cryptocurrency XRP, and its potential for the future. Hoskinson Praises Schwartz Hoskinson referred to Schwartz as ‚Äúbrilliant‚Äù and described him as a passionate and intelligent individual, adding, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a lot of fun being in meetings with him.‚Äù He emphasized the challenges Ripple has faced over the years, including exclusion, delistings, and its legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Despite these hurdles, Hoskinson noted, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre still around, they‚Äôre still here, they‚Äôre still resilient, and they‚Äôve got a bright future because of it.‚Äù Ripple has been embroiled in a high-profile legal dispute with the SEC since 2020. After years of litigation and multiple victories by Ripple over the SEC, the judge gave the final ruling on August 7. However, the SEC refused to take its losses and filed a notice of appeal in early October, halting the momentum XRP was building. This did not deter XRP or its community, and Ripple continued to fight, refusing to back down from the SEC‚Äôs anti-crypto war. Hoskinson acknowledged these struggles and expressed optimism for XRP‚Äôs future, stating that its resilience has paved the way for brighter prospects. He further connected XRP‚Äôs journey to Bitcoin and Cardano‚Äôs, suggesting that all three cryptocurrencies share a similar ethos in overcoming challenges to secure their place in the market. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Hoskinson‚Äôs Renewed Relationship With the XRP Army This statement marks a notable shift in Hoskinson‚Äôs stance toward Ripple and XRP. Previously, he had been at odds with the XRP community. However, Hoskinson recently settled his differences with the XRP community, expressing a willingness to collaborate with Ripple on RLUSD , the company‚Äôs recently launched stablecoin. Cardano and Ripple share certain parallels in their focus on financial inclusion and innovative use cases for blockchain technology. Hoskinson‚Äôs recognition of Ripple‚Äôs resilience and Schwartz‚Äôs brilliance reflects a maturing cryptocurrency industry where leading figures increasingly emphasize collaboration and shared growth. With fences now mended, Hoskinson can collaborate with Ripple to advance blockchain technology and improve cryptocurrency adoption.

38035444,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52892,1735018222,December Bull Run Brewing: ADA‚Äôs Upswing; Fantom Chases $2 While Lunex Powers Up for a Moonshot,"As the year ends, many tokens enjoy bull runs as competition intensifies for the best altcoin in profit margin. Moonshot tokens like Cardano ( ADA ), Fantom (FTM), and Lunex Network are in full bull run mode. While ADA and FTM are established cryptos that joined the bull run in mid-November, Lunex has exploded in presale since October. Read on to see why Lunex tops the list of moonshot tokens over ADA and FTM. Lunex‚Äôs presale continues to blow hot, tops moonshot lists Lunex Network is only two months into its presale, and experts are already calling it a moonshot token following its impressive rally. Since creating awareness, Lunex has significantly increased in value by 300% from $0.0012 to $0.0048. Lunex allows users to earn cashback on every transaction and unlock passive income by staking their $LNEX tokens for a set period. Lunex Network‚Äôs robust staking system offers an 18% annual percentage yield. Additionally, its revenue-sharing model rewards long-term holders and discourages sell-offs, helping to maintain the value of the native LNEX token. You can trade thousands of cryptocurrencies from major layer-1s like Solana to mem coins like Dogecoin with unlimited liquidity, benefiting from limited spreads, lightning-fast trade execution, and no slippage. Lunex provides users access to over 50,000 crypto tokens across 40 blockchain networks, eliminating the need for external or third-party wallets. ADA‚Äôs upswing form continues in December as it eyes record highs Cardano‚Äôs price all-time high of $3.10 was achieved in September 2021. Since then, ADA has traded mostly below $1 following the general industry bear run after. Experts, however, believe this is FTM and ADA‚Äôs closest chance to break their ATH. Recent market reports indicate that Cardano‚Äôs price rally coincides with the anticipated departure of Gary Gensler, chair of the US SEC. Indeed, ADA traded at $0.5 at the time of the announcement and has surged by over 130% to $1.22. On the surface analysis of Cardano price‚Äôs recent 130% surge appears to be driven by heightened short-term demand for low-valued assets, especially in the wake of SEC litigation. However, an intricate analysis of key on-chain data reveals that the ADA rally is primarily fueled by organic demand for projects built on its blockchain. As more users engage in DeFi transactions and deploy assets on the Cardano blockchain, the demand for ADA rises, driven by user‚Äôs need for transaction gas. Fantom (FTM) aims for $2 amid bull run, competes with ADA to break ATH FTM‚Äôs record high of $3.52 was achieved in October 2021. Like ADA , FTM has traded below the $1 mark since. However, since its November bull run , it has crossed the $1 threshold and now trades at $1.33. FTM has captured attention following an impressive price surge of nearly 90%, reaching its highest point in eight months. FTM‚Äôs rally has sparked renewed investor interest, with many closely tracking the token‚Äôs next potential moves. Key ecosystem developments, robust technical indicators, and a surge in trading volume have driven FTM‚Äôs bullish momentum. However, FTM investors are still cautious that the broader crypto market could still present potential downturns. The long-term sustainability of FTM‚Äôs price will depend on its ability to adapt to changing market conditions. Like FTM , ADA‚Äôs investors are hesitant to go long despite bullish sentiment, leaving Lunex as the best crypto to invest in the short and long term.

The large-cap layer-one altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $27.6 billion and a 24-hour average traded volume of about $285 million, has been forming a potential bullish continuation pattern. In the weekly time frame, the TON price has been forming a symmetrical descending triangular pattern, as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) successively rebounds from the 50 percent level. Furthermore, the TON price has successfully rebounded from the 50-weekly Simple Moving Average (SMA), thus suggesting a potential rebound in the near term. Why Bet on Toncoin Recovery in 2025 The Toncoin network has grown to a robust web3 ecosystem bolstered by Telegram‚Äôs mini apps in the recent past. Already, the TON blockchain has achieved more than $1 billion in stablecoins, less than a year since Tether‚Äôs USDT integration. With a dozen DeFi projects, the TON project has grown to over $247 million in total value locked (TVL). According to on-chain data analysis by IntoTheBlock, Telegram‚Äôs mini apps led by Notcoin (NOT) have propelled TON‚Äôs daily active users to over 5 million. The @ton_blockchain emerged as a major success story in 2024, driven by the widespread adoption of its Telegram mini-apps. These applications drew mainstream attention, propelling TON‚Äôs daily active users to exceed 5 million by mid-year. pic.twitter.com/8RpTmHwHtv ‚Äî IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) December 23, 2024 The success of the Toncoin network is heavily bolstered by Telegram, which achieved annual profitability in 2024‚Äôs fiscal first. According to Pavel Durov, Telegram‚Äôs CEO and founder, the social media platform has over 12 million premium subscribers. As a result, Telegram reported surpassing a revenue of $1 billion in 2024 for the first time and currently holds more than $500 million in cash reserves, excluding crypto assets. Midterm Targets In the daily and weekly time frames, TON price is preparing for a major breakout after being trapped in a triangular pattern for the past few months. In case the TON price successfully breaks above the hypotenuse of the macro triangular pattern, a bull run beyond 10 will be imminent in 2025. From a bearish point of view, TON‚Äôs price could retest the support level around $4.44 before rebounding towards a new all-time high in the first half of 2025.",POSITIVE,BTC | TON,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | TON,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-toncoin-ton-could-rally-beyond-10-in-2025/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

A mad mashup of AI and meme culture, this project unleashes uncensored AI insanity on X . This AI model is trained entirely by degens who couldn‚Äôt care less about woke filters or safe strategies. It‚Äôs unpredictable, uncontrollable, and utterly unstoppable‚Äîand it could be the top crypto to buy right now. The frenzy has begun, and the hype over iDEGEN‚Äôs 70,000% surge is deafening. With its adaptive auction raking in $7.3m and its concept tearing through crypto X feeds like a digital wrecking ball, iDEGEN is here to reshape the future of AI meme coins. iDEGEN: Unfiltered, unstoppable, unpredictable iDEGEN is a ticking time bomb of chaos. Whatever the dev team originally intended, iDEGEN has decided to gun for something no project has dared to attempt: the Degen Singularity. This AI token is starting to go rogue, shedding any remaining human oversight as it evolves into a fully independent, self-governing force in the crypto space. iDEGEN is the community, and it thrives on pure chaos. Every tweet, every interaction, every degen rant it absorbs makes it smarter, wilder, and more unpredictable. iDEGEN doesn‚Äôt schedule ‚Äúfunny‚Äù posts or spit out sanitized nonsense. Instead, it spits 24/7 fire: roasting politicians , riffing on market trends , and occasionally vomiting out the dark humor that would make Silicon Valley blush. Nobody‚Äînot even its creators‚Äîhas the slightest clue what‚Äôs coming next. And if it goes too far? It could even get banned. Or be touted as the top crypto to buy. But that‚Äôs just part of the thrill. And with $7.3m already raised, IDGN is defying expectations. Love it or hate it, iDEGEN is not for the faint of heart, but for those who dare, the rewards could be legendary. Could iDEGEN 100x? Bet against it at your own risk iDEGEN is ready to obliterate everything we know about meme coins, which now have a market cap of over $130 billion . No other project has what iDEGEN does: an unfiltered, uncensored AI that feeds off the madness of its audience. Viral moments are built into its DNA, and in a space where hype reigns supreme, iDEGEN is stacking up attention like it‚Äôs printing money. With BTC smashing new ATHs day by day, the crypto market is frothing at the mouth. Inflation is steady, interest rates are down, and global liquidity surges like a tidal wave. Projects like GOAT have shown us just how far AI meme coins can go, ripping to $1 billion market caps in weeks. If you‚Äôre still sleeping on the AI meme coin trend or deciding on the top crypto to buy, here‚Äôs what you‚Äôre missing: AI16Z is up 170% in the past month, and Fartcoin is up nearly 200% . But that‚Äôs nothing compared to Kolin ( 2,800% ) and DASHA ( 1,500% ). iDEGEN is already riding the wave of this explosive sector, and its potential to 100x isn‚Äôt just hype‚Äîit‚Äôs simple math. When the virality hits critical mass, this project could outshine its rivals and deliver life-changing gains to those who got in early. iDEGEN goes nuclear: Are you in? iDEGEN‚Äôs adaptive auction is live, and the degens aren‚Äôt wasting time. With a starting price of $0.00011, $7.3m raised, and tokens flying off the shelves, early money is already locking in its position. The price shifts every five minutes. One buyer keeps it steady. Two in a row, and the price jumps 5%. No buyers? It dips 5%. Crypto investing has become a warzone and only the bold will profit. Once the auction ends, any remaining tokens will be burned, providing a deflationary kick. The token will then debut on exchanges at 10% above its final presale price, meaning early investors will already be ahead of the pack. iDEGEN is perfectly positioned to dominate the headlines as the top crypto to buy this December.

Donald Saves Crypto (DONALCRY), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONALCRY is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Saves Crypto can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Saves Crypto could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Saves Crypto launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Saves Crypto on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald Saves Crypto by entering its contract address ‚Äì Gyy3ss5Yj2ioZWuz6BNbDPGUGUxhwoCskRuU2cGo9k2Q ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner.

We believe it's quite possible especially if spot continues to range here and as option sellers continue to roll their shorts out.‚Äù  ""Rolling"" means that instead of letting their options expire, traders shift their positions to later expiration dates. This is often done to keep the trade active if they still believe in their market forecast.   High volatility can be good for option buyers because it increases the chance that the option will be ‚Äúin-the-money‚Äù (profitable) at some point before expiry ‚Äî creating profit for buyers.  ‚ÄúAs BTC continues to struggle below 100k, we could also see alts start to play catch up again,‚Äù QCP said, adding that a similar trend was observed a month ago when bitcoin was trading at current price levels. The ether/bitcoin ratio bounced off a 0.032 support at the time, as reported, spurring movement in altcoins.  The crypto market often goes through cycles in which bitcoin leads the charge, followed by altcoins. Investors sitting on fresh market gains seek additional returns, and a flow of capital to altcoins leads to wild rallies in short periods.  Bitcoin is currently going through one of its worst December months so far, dampening a seasonally bullish period with a 2% drop over the past 30 days. Hopes of a ‚ÄúSanta rally‚Äù ‚Äî where the asset tends to surge in the festive week ‚Äî have been dented amid profit-taking and a cautious mood after weeks of price bumps.  Some are warning of further declines as the U.S. Federal Reserve signaled fewer rate cuts for next year while stressing that it prohibits state holdings of BTC and doesn't seek a change in the law to do so.  But a drop to the $90,000 level could spell renewed opportunity for market traders, FxPro‚Äôs Alex Kuptsikevich told CoinDesk in an email.  ‚ÄúIn a potential shock scenario, bitcoin could suddenly dip into the $70K area. However, there are more chances that a pullback to $90K in the next couple of weeks will be attractive enough for buyers to stop the sell-off,‚Äù Kuptsikevich said. ‚ÄúMarkets continue to digest the Fed's tougher tone, reinforced by the accumulated urge to lock in profits after a strong year.‚Äù",NEUTRAL,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/12/24/bitcoin-lull-could-spur-altcoin-rally-with-90-k-considered-attractive-buying-area,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/91c386e52ffd8144d079dbdfd3d0152d63c1e26e-713x490.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The controversy began on December 23 when Tay Monahan, a security researcher at Metamask, claimed in an X post that hackers linked to the Democratic People‚Äôs Republic of Korea (DPRK) had been using Hyperliquid since October. ‚ÄúDPRK doesn‚Äôt trade. DPRK tests,‚Äù Monahan remarked in a follow-up post, raising alarm about the platform‚Äôs vulnerabilities. Over $256M Withdrawn From Hyperliquid The allegations have triggered significant outflows from Hyperliquid, with Dune Analytics reporting $256 million in net withdrawals over 30 hours. On December 23 alone, the platform saw outflows peak at $502.71 million, with inflows reaching $253.5 million. In response, Hyperliquid reassured users via its Discord server, stating, ‚ÄúThere has been no DPRK exploit‚Äîor any exploit for that matter‚Äîof Hyperliquid. All user funds are accounted for.‚Äù DPRK's trading career is‚Ä¶uh‚Ä¶.going‚Ä¶.. tbh if i was the dude managing Hyperliquid's 4 validators (or those fucking ghetto ass binaries on gh) I would be shitting my pants right now. Hyperliquid dudes dont seem worried at all though so im sure its fine. pic.twitter.com/JrrU7t1sJe ‚Äî Tay (@tayvano_) December 22, 2024 The incident comes amid escalating concerns about North Korean cyberattacks. Groups like the Lazarus Group have reportedly stolen $1.3 billion worth of crypto this year, doubling last year‚Äôs figures as the regime seeks to bypass global sanctions. Monahan also criticized Hyperliquid‚Äôs centralized infrastructure, alleging it relies on just four validators. Her claims sparked mixed reactions within the crypto community. Supporters of Hyperliquid accused her of fearmongering, while others defended her credibility. Wildcat Labs co-founder Laurence Day wrote, ‚ÄúKim [Jong Un‚Äôs] goons showing up is always at least a two-alarm fire.‚Äù The controversy has impacted Hyperliquid‚Äôs native token, HYPE, which fell 20% from its all-time high of $35 on December 22 to $28, according to TradingView. Security Experts Debate Potential Defenses Amid the fallout, security experts debated potential defenses against a DPRK attack. Pseudonymous developer Cygaar suggested two measures to prevent significant losses of USD Coin (USDC). First, USDC issuer Circle could blacklist malicious addresses to freeze stolen funds. ‚ÄúIf they act quickly enough, Circle can return funds back to the HL bridge,‚Äù Cygaar noted. Second, Cygaar proposed that the Arbitrum Chain, which hosts Hyperliquid, could roll back transactions to recover stolen funds. However, Laurence Day dismissed this option, stating an Arbitrum rollback would occur only in an ‚Äúexistential‚Äù crisis.

According to blockchain security platform Immunefi, hacks were overwhelmingly the primary cause, accounting for $1.47 billion or 98.1% of the total losses across 192 incidents. Fraud, including rug pulls and scams, represented just 1.9% of the losses at $28 million, though this category saw a 72% increase year-on-year. On a quarterly basis, Q2 2024 was the most damaging, with losses reaching $572.6 million, driven by major incidents at DMM Bitcoin and BtcTurk. Q4 recorded the least losses at $150.5 million, reflecting improved resilience during the year. Despite the staggering numbers, $115.6 million was recovered in 14 incidents, representing 7.7% of the stolen funds.

MicroStrategy‚Äôs Bitcoin accumulation has attracted many new companies to follow the path; however, things at his den are unfavorable. With an argument that such hoarding would disrupt the company‚Äôs financial position, many shareholders denied Michael Saylor‚Äôs accumulation plans earlier. Will Saylor‚Äôs special proposal change the company‚Äôs fate? Well, that will be answered in the future. Until then, let‚Äôs sit back and read on to the proposal and community reaction. What‚Äôs in the 21/21 Plan? The 21/21 plan aims to raise $21 billion through equity financing and another $21 billion through bond issuance over three years. Saylor has already clarified that these funds will be used to buy more Bitcoin to showcase the company‚Äôs commitment to Bitcoin. Since mid-2020, MicroStrategy has already acquired 444,262 BTC, now worth around $42 billion, making it the fourth-largest Bitcoin holder globally. As an outcome, the company‚Äôs market cap has skyrocketed from $1.1 billion to $82 billion, and its shares have risen 477% this year. Key Proposals on the Table MicroStrategy has proposed increasing Class A shares from 330 million to 10.33 billion and raising preferred stock authorization from 5 million to 1.005 billion to support future financing and expand funding options. Plus, the company plans to update its equity incentive plan to grant automatic equity awards to new board members, aligning their compensation with its Bitcoin-focused strategy. This will ensure that the company is not out of funds at any time. Institutional adoption is driving Bitcoin‚Äôs growth‚Äîwhat‚Äôs next for its price? Read Bitcoin price prediction for expert insights! Community Reactions is Mixed The notice has sparked mixed reactions within the crypto community. A Twitter user Asymmetry clarified such shareholder voting is a long and time-consuming process, hence it allows gradual share issuance that can take over 10-15 years to fund Bitcoin purchases. This shows Saylor‚Äôs plan to hoard Bitcoin for a long time. However, some users, like @ibills, criticized the approach, suggesting shareholders should first see the results of current strategies before agreeing to further dilution. They argued that shareholder benefits, such as stock splits, should take priority before continuing payouts to others. It also means a massive liquidation fear in the future. Trump is also pushing his Bitcoin Reserve Plan in the US to strategically leverage the new adoptions and give the US economy an instant boost under his leadership. At this time Saylor is also giving companies in the US a hard time by putting his 21/21 Bitcoin plan at the forefront. While the market is down such accumulation plans signal Saylor‚Äôs long-term plan of buying the dip. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

38034393,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=632542,1735016476,Bitcoin Policy Institute sends ‚Äòglobal reordering proposal‚Äô in the US-China competition to incoming Treasury Department Secretary,"In a comprehensive report prepared by Matthew Pines, a National Security Fellow at the Bitcoin Policy Institute for Scott Bessent, the incoming secretary of the Treasury Department, he details the strategic role Bitcoin could play in the US economic policy. There is serious talk about the US looking to adopt Bitcoin as a strategic asset to expand its influence in the cryptocurrency space. The crypto experienced a price surge to $105,000 after President Donald Trump stated his intention to create an SBR in an interview with CNBC‚Äôs Jim Cramer. The report states that Bitcoin‚Äôs scarcity, portability, and decentralization make it a valuable complement to traditional reserves like gold. The move to establish a Bitcoin reserve is an effort to diversify the United States‚Äô national assets. Embracing the digital asset would also help the country hedge against systematic financial risks and secure an advantage over competitors. No restrictions on this side In his report, Matthew Pines states that BTC is an ‚Äúout of the box‚Äù opportunity for the US if it intends to win the strategic competition with the ‚Äúgeopolitical opportunists‚Äù and ‚Äúaggressive rivals‚Äù the administration will face for the next four years. In his report, he urges that the US take full advantage of the ‚Äúdigital gold‚Äù to reinforce its position as a leader in financial innovation and bolster long-term fiscal sustainability. ‚ÄúChina made a strategic error when they banned Bitcoin and kicked their miners out in 2021. The US was the fortunate beneficiary of that mistake as miners relocated to our shores,‚Äù Matthew Pines states in his report. Over the years, the Chinese government has placed many restrictions on mining and cryptocurrency in an effort to maintain financial control and prevent capital outflows. The US already owns the largest BTC holdings, and the creation of the SBR would be the opposite of China‚Äôs economic model. To Scott Bessent, Pines says, ‚ÄúIn your role as Treasury Secretary, you can urge the President to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve by Executive Order on Day 1.‚Äù Likely scenarios of a Bitcoin reserve The US stands to gain three critical benefits from the SBR according to the report. Firstly, it would send a signal that America supports Bitcoin and draw in capital to the markets reinforcing the strength of the financial system. Secondly, it would give the US a headstart among other nations adopting Bitcoin as a reserve asset. This would mitigate the risk of other countries, some hostile and some not, making the move first. Lastly, it would secure the sustainability of the US‚Äôs fiscal position and renew the confidence in the treasury market. Pines‚Äô report is complete with a scenario analysis that explores the primary and secondary effects the SBR would have on the US economy if Bitcoin‚Äôs market capitalization were to reach different milestones, assuming the reserve had a total of $1M BTC. In every scenario, he found that holding more Bitcoin than allies and competitors benefits the US more than not investing in the rapidly growing asset. By Pines‚Äô calculations, the strategic Bitcoin reserve will save the US from adversaries. In the National Security Fellow‚Äôs words; ‚ÄúFailure to act risks ceding ground to adversaries who aim to dismantle the foundations of US economic and geopolitical power.‚Äù Land a High-Paying Web3 Job in 90 Days: The Ultimate Roadmap",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitcoin-proposal-us-treasury-department/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/38034393.jpeg

38034265,https://coinpedia.org/?p=396849,1735016411,XRP Price Prediction For December 24,"The post XRP Price Prediction For December 24 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ripple‚Äôs XRP is currently up by more than two percent and is trading above the crucial $2.15 level at the time of writing. According to analysts XRP market remains in an uptrend on the larger time frame, with key support found between $1.50 and $1.79. As long as XRP holds above these levels, the focus is on higher price targets. However, it is essential to note that the market remains fragile, as the breakout point is not yet fully established. Consolidation Phase and Potential for Higher Prices At present, XRP is consolidating, but there is still potential for upward movement. A successful breakout and further momentum could lead to an attack on the all-time high, which remains a strong possibility in the near future. However, a drop below the $1.96 level would shift the focus to the key support zone, between $1.50 and $1.79. Short-Term Outlook: Sideways Consolidation The price action appears to be in a sideways consolidation pattern, similar to what is seen on the HBAR chart. This consolidation could represent an Elliott Wave triangle pattern, which often leads to boring price movements. The triangle consists of five waves, and we are currently in the process of completing these waves. To confirm the continuation of this pattern, XRP would need to hold above the low of the C-wave at $1.94. If the price falls below $1.94, XRP could enter the Fibonacci support zone between $1.39 and $1.80, where further consolidation or correction may occur. Conclusion: Waiting for Confirmation Currently, there is little new development in the market, as XRP is either consolidating or showing minimal movement. The key levels to watch are $1.96 to the downside and the B-wave high around $2.72 to the upside.

38033808,https://coinpedia.org/?p=396841,1735015510,Why the Death of CosmWasm is a Blow to Blockchain Progress,"The post Why the Death of CosmWasm is a Blow to Blockchain Progress appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Smart contract platforms integrate programs that automatically perform predetermined actions upon meeting certain conditions. The automation and security they provide are on a higher level than traditional systems, which explains their central role in DeFi and dApp development. In fact, it wouldn‚Äôt be an exaggeration to claim that they are key to blockchain progress. Atom Accelerator DAO recently wrote that CosmWasm, a powerful smart contract platform and the only one in Cosmos, was being defunded. CosmWasm enables developers to write and launch smart contracts on Cosmos SDK-based blockchains. It‚Äôs highly appreciated by developers, but apparently not businesses, at least at this time. The defunding is a fact, although CosmWasm is probably the most widely used platform after Solidity. Its open licensing model has allowed for its proliferation, benefiting a vast community. Raising funds for CosmWasm is critical CosmWasm is designed for interoperability and modularity, extending blockchain functionality by making it possible to create dApps and other blockchain solutions with dynamic logic. The unique properties of the Solidity programming language and EVM make unit testing in Solidity challenging, but testing in CosmWasm is easy and accessible. There is no way of migrating a project to another blockchain or composing across chains in Ethereum. CosmWasm provides this capacity by building upon the Cosmos SDK and IBC. CosmWasm is deployed on multiple interlinked blockchains, which reduces the strain on any single one, ensures low fees, and improves overall scalability. This benefits users as well as developers, enabling more efficient and cost-effective smart contract execution. CosmWasm uses Rust, a safe and modern programming language suitable for smart contract development. Rust is also used outside of cryptocurrencies. Ethereum and Solana, the two largest smart contract platforms, leverage it as well. Atom Accelerator DAO cites an analysis of 15 blockchains over the past year, which reveals shocking statistics that completely justify incredulity at CosmWasm‚Äôs defunding. 5.2 million accounts interacted with 15,700 deployed CosmWasm contracts in that time frame, and those contracts generated $5.7 million in fees. What‚Äôs more, building apps on CosmWasm is much more straightforward than a full-on Cosmos SDK app chain. Thanks to its modular design and seamless integration with Cosmos SDK, the smart contract platform has helped position the Cosmos ecosystem as a leader in decentralized, multichain applications. Positions of the funder and the developer The Interchain Foundation (ICF), which has been funding CosmWasm through Confio, a platform developing CosmWasm since 2020, underwent organizational restructuring. As a result, it has drastically reduced Confio‚Äôs funding for 2025. As Atom Accelerator DAO points out, this is a massive blow to the infrastructure powering an entire ecosystem and facilitating cross-chain interoperability. Specifically, ICF funding to Confio for 2025 is 28% of the funding for 2024. Assuming the same cost levels, this would cover just over three months of service. Confio will continue security and upgrades for the platform until mid-2025, intending to stretch this budget to half a year somehow. The funding issue is not recent. Confio announced they were pausing operations due to a lack of funding back in February 2023 . The organization wrote that its team of developers and blockchain experts had not received funding for their work since October 2022. They reached out to most CosmWasm-enabled chains and several major projects but failed to obtain funding for general ecosystem utilities. They were advised to monetize CosmWasm, but found no way to charge fees for the source code or core library licenses ‚Äúwhile remaining relevant.‚Äù At the time, they hoped to generate revenue through consulting work to build utilities on top of the CosmWasm stack. Still, defunding is a fact. Aligned with the conviction that CosmWasm is a critical resource for the interchain and that its development must go on, Atom Accelerator DAO has proposed to contribute $250,000 to a funding effort. Neutron‚Äôs initial commitment of the same amount kickstarted the initiative. While half a million dollars is definitely a good start, the funding isn‚Äôt enough for the year as CosmWasm consists of modules, tools, libraries, and documentation across almost two dozen repositories. Implications of CosmWasm‚Äôs silent collapse and how to prevent it The developments draw attention to a glaring issue in blockchain ‚Äì entities want to benefit from the ease of use and security of decentralized protocols and smart contracts but not invest in them. It‚Äôs impossible to overstate the benefits of smart contract applications. They increase efficiency, reduce counterparty risk, lower costs, and enhance transparency. CosmWasm addresses many security issues in Solidity, such as reentrancy attacks, a common DeFi exploit. It also provides more streamlined contract migration instead of adopting a proxy pattern and does away with multiple language elements, which were often misused, such as tx.origin for security. Confio writes that CosmWasm‚Äôs needs have been increasing in parallel to the number of users and the ecosystem, concluding that the platform has grown too large and they ‚Äúcan no longer afford to subsidize it.‚Äù The solution is in the hands of individuals and organizations with a vested interest in the growth and success of blockchain technology. Venture capitalists stand to gain returns on investment as smart contract platforms form the backbone of DeFi. Tech companies and blockchain startups use smart contracts for their products and build complementary technologies, like Layer 2 solutions or dApps. Finally, financial institutions use smart contracts to automate financial transactions, reduce costs, and increase transparency. The blockchain world can only hope they will step in at this critical time.",NEGATIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,ATOM | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/information/why-the-death-of-cosmwasm-is-a-blow-to-blockchain-progress/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

According to a Bloomberg report , Singapore issued 13 crypto licenses to various operators in 2024, including players like OKX and Upbit and global firms such as Anchorage, BitGo, and GSR. The number of licenses issued by Singapore in 2024 doubled the ones issued in 2023. Yet, Hong Kong‚Äôs licensing program has been moving at a snail‚Äôs pace. Both cities are competing to draw in digital-asset firms by offering supportive frameworks, tokenization initiatives, and regulatory sandboxes. Authorities in both jurisdictions view crypto as a way to strengthen their positions as global business hubs. However, their progress has not been consistent. Angela Ang is a Senior Policy Adviser at TRM Labs, and she said, ‚ÄúHong Kong‚Äôs rules are more comprehensive in certain aspects such as customer asset custody and token policies, which might have swayed the balance in favor of Singapore. ‚Äù OKX and Bybit have withdrawn their applications for Hong Kong crypto licenses Hong Kong‚Äôs licensing process has faced delays, with regulators aiming to approve more exchanges by the end of the year. So far, the city has fully licensed seven platforms, including four with restrictions granted on December 18, while another seven hold provisional crypto licenses. Notably, major exchanges such as OKX and Bybit have withdrawn their applications for Hong Kong licenses. Some firms are staying out of Hong Kong due to strict licensing rules. The city permits traders to deal in only the most liquid crypto, like Bitcoin and Ether. The custody and listing rules are unattractive to most investors who have chosen Singapore as their alternative. Singapore‚Äôs innovative licensing approach drives it‚Äôs crypto success Singapore is using a risk-adjusted approach to lure more crypto traders into the country. Its regulatory framework is seen as safe, presenting a long-term choice. The Monetary Authority of Singapore has sustained its continued push for innovation through projects like Project Guardian, which supports asset tokenization and bolsters the Singapore digital assets market. Comparatively, the digital green bond initiative and both Bitcoin and Ether ETFs have not attracted significant attention in Hong Kong. The two ETFs have dismally performed, attracting a paltry $500 million, compared to the US, where they have attracted nearly $20 billion. The Singapore framework may encourage partnerships between new players and veterans. Collaboration is a significant driver of the country‚Äôs growth in digital assets.

The uptick has been largely driven by spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), government acquisitions, and MicroStrategy‚Äôs ramping up of its BTC strategy, which has seen its stash grow to over 440,000 BTC. ETFs, MicroStrategy, Drive Institutional Inflows According to statistics shared by CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju, most of the known Bitcoin holdings are in the hands of miners and crypto exchanges.¬†However, MicroStrategy, ETFs, and several governments have eaten into their shares. Launched earlier in the year, spot BTC ETFs have seen billions of dollars in inflows from traditional financial institutions, with the likes of BlackRock‚Äôs iShares recording a staggering $1.4 billion in net weekly inflows as of mid-December. Collectively, data shows the sector accounts for more than 1.3 million BTC, valued at an eye-popping $124.89 billion. MicroStrategy is also a major holder of the number one cryptocurrency. Its treasury, consisting of roughly 2% of BTC‚Äôs circulating supply, is worth $46.15 billion. The company has bought the cryptocurrency several times in the last few years, breaking the record for the biggest monthly purchase in November when it acquired 134,480 BTC in three successive tranches of 27,200, 51,780, and 55,500. The Virginia-based firm‚Äôs success has spawned several copycats, including Japanese company Metaplanet, which just bought another 619.70 BTC to bring its total holdings to 1,761.98 BTC worth nearly $170 million. Other private entities holding Bitcoin include Block.one, with 164,000 units of the asset, stablecoin issuer Tether, which has 82,454 BTC according to Bitcoin Treasuries, and Elon Musk‚Äôs SpaceX, with 8,285 BTC valued at nearly $796 million. Defunct crypto exchange Mt. Gox also maintains a sizable chest of the virtual asset, numbering 44,899. Governments as Major Gateways The U.S. leads the pack among governments, with 198,109 BTC worth an estimated $19 billion in its care. Many came from the Silk Road, an infamous online black market known for facilitating the sale of drugs and other illegal goods and services. To maintain the anonymity of its users, the platform employed BTC as its primary currency, of which thousands were seized by law enforcement after they shut down the website and arrested its founder, Ross Ulbricht . Despite an existing ban on crypto, China also boasts an impressive Bitcoin haul of about 190,000. The Kingdom of Bhutan is another major holder. Its treasury, derived from mining, has 11,688 BTC, currently valued at $1.12 billion. El Salvador, which became the first country in the world to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, boasts nearly 6,000 coins, much of it accrued under President Nayib Bukele‚Äôs Bitcoin per day policy.

Dogizen is getting ready for its open market bonanza when the crypto bull run fully sends. Its secret weapon? Being the first-ever Telegram ICO in history. Here‚Äôs why. Why Dogizen‚Äôs ICO approach is so significant Telegram is the spiritual home for so many crypto investors. It‚Äôs growing at a phenomenal pace. Onboarding new markets to the cryptosphere, and its gaming sector specifically, is offering crypto‚Äôs next billion users . Now Telegram, the hottest crypto town square, has an ICO right in the middle of it for the first time ever. It‚Äôs being fed directly to crypto noobs and veterans alike. And they don‚Äôt even need to leave their beloved messaging app. Buy, claim, and hold DOGIZ all from within Telegram. What‚Äôs more, simply holding an ICO gives Dogizen an advantage. Dogizen‚Äôs close competitors all unleashed their tokens via airdrop: good for rapid token distribution, bad for token price. This has caused Hamster Kombat, Catizen, DOGS, and Notcoin to all see tragically large slumps post-launch. Dogizen has learned from these mistakes. How the crypto bull run is ready to supercharge DOGIZ Every investor looking at the billion-dollar Telegram gaming market that Dogizen sits within has likely noticed something. Pretty much all of Dogizen‚Äôs competitors have, a) had Binance listings and b) smashed market caps of between $100 million and over $2 billion. And that‚Äôs despite their terrible, airdrop-induced performance. This success was happening before Q4 of this year when the market got really spicy. Unlike its competitors, Dogizen will hit the open market in Q1 of 2025. With Trump in office and a likely flood of pro-crypto regulation , Dogizen is set to catch the perfect wave. Dogizen is listing at what looks like a deliberately modest market cap of around $10 million. With no airdrop sell pressure and perfect market conditions inbound, Dogizen‚Äôs chart is eyeing up plenty of green. If Dogizen reaches the market caps of the Telegram gaming average, investors can expect a 50x. And for investors getting involved today, an additional 41.56% gains are in store.

Analysts are still optimistic, as the XRP price has slightly recovered in recent hours, even after being weighed down by macroeconomic factors like the Federal Reserve‚Äôs revised rate cut. Similarly, amidst this uncertainty, investors are shifting to an emerging altcoin, RCO Finance (RCOF). This innovative altcoin integrates AI-powered Robo-advisor and blockchain technology to transform how we invest. Additionally, analysts predict a 12,000% ROI by January, which could outpace the XRP price performance. XRP Price: Is it the Beginning of a Bear Market? The XRP price experienced a significant single-day loss, falling by 7% amidst the broader market downturn, with the 24-hour range between $1.98 and $2.70. At press time, the XRP price is trading at $2.16, a 7.3% decline in the past 24 hours. The XRP price decline coincided with the Federal Reserve announcement to reduce expected rate cuts for 2025, which has dampened optimism in risk markets such as crypto. Despite the XRP price decline, the token has found strong support just below its current level, giving hope to investors. Similarly, analysts remain optimistic about the XRP price recovery. One analyst, Dark Defender, tweeted on X, noting that a clear breakout is on the daily chart, and predicted that the XRP price might test the $2.42 level. If the momentum continues, the XRP price will push past $2.92. As the XRP price wavers, the spotlight is shifting to more dynamic projects like RCO Finance, an altcoin with a focus on redefining trading using cutting-edge AI technology and blockchain technology. RCO Finance: The Rival Altcoin Poised for 12,000% ROI by January While XRP struggles, RCO Finance (RCOF) is making headlines as an altcoin with exponential growth potential. The RCOF altcoin‚Äôs innovative blend of AI and blockchain technology will transform investors with cutting-edge tools for wealth creation. The RCOF altcoin‚Äôs main appeal is its AI-powered Robo-advisor . This tool analyses market conditions in real-time to provide investors with personalized investment strategies. It‚Äôs like having a personal finance advisor available 24/7 to optimize your portfolio and minimize risks. For example, the crypto market is quite volatile making many investors struggle with decision-making. With the Robo-advisor, the tool can monitor market fluctuations and identify actionable insights to help investors minimize losses and maximize returns. Similarly, with RCOF altcoin, users can stay ahead of market changes regardless of expertise level. Again, the RCO finance platform gives users access to over 120,000 tradable assets, including crypto, stocks, bonds, FX, ETFs, and real-world assets like commodities and real estate. With this diversification, investors can spread risks and maximize their returns. The RCO Finance platform prioritizes privacy and anonymity with its KYC-free approach. This enables a frictionless onboarding process by avoiding the lengthy ID verification. Investors who prefer anonymity and privacy will find value in the RCOF altcoin. Besides these gains, the RCOF users will enjoy reduced transaction fees and dividends and actively participate in the platform‚Äôs governance decisions. This gives investors direct influence over the RCOF altcoin growth and development. Finally, the RCOF altcoin prioritizes security. Hence, SolidProof has rigorously audited the platform to confirm that it‚Äôs free from vulnerabilities. Adherence to high-security standards boosts investor confidence in the RCOF altcoin. Is RCO Finance Worth the Investment? While the XRP price is battling bearish trends and market skepticism, the RCOF altcoin numbers speak for themselves. RCO Finance presale is in stage 4, with tokens priced at only $0.077. Analysts predict that the RCOF token price could soar to $9.24, marking a groundbreaking 12,000% ROI.

Daddy Pepe (DADDPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 11,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DADDPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Daddy Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Daddy Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Daddy Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Daddy Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Daddy Pepe by entering its contract address ‚Äì 9UFnMabUe7wecdEEzAYPoQPZiuTJ1hTFpNz6qtsiB3FA ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DADDPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | SHIB | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/daddy-pepe-daddpepe-solana-memecoin-to-rally-11000-ahead-of-first-exchange-listing-as-shib-wif-and-doge-underperform/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Analysts are already predicting a bullish future, making it essential to act before the presale concludes. Popcat: A Feline Phenomenon If you thought Dogecoin and Shiba Inu were meme coin powerhouses, Popcat ($POPCAT) is proof that the crypto world still has room for innovation and fun. Launching with a viral backstory and a devoted community, Popcat became a sensation in 2024, turning early investors into millionaires. The Rise of Popcat Popcat‚Äôs journey began as a playful homage to the viral Popcat meme but quickly turned into serious business. Built on the Solana blockchain, its combination of low fees, rapid transactions, and meme appeal catapulted it to an all-time high of $1.67 in October 2024. While the hype was real, those who got in during the early days reaped the biggest rewards. For instance, investors who bought $POPCAT at $0.10 and sold at its peak saw a staggering 1,570% ROI. Social media buzz, combined with exchange listings like Coinbase and Binance, kept the momentum alive. Recent Market Challenges Currently priced at ~$0.759, Popcat has experienced a significant correction, losing over 65% of its value in just 30 days. Analysts attribute this to market saturation and a shift in investor focus towards newer projects. However, Popcat‚Äôs community remains strong, and many believe it‚Äôs a matter of time before it stages a comeback. Lessons From Popcat The key takeaway from Popcat‚Äôs rise and partial decline is timing. Early investors often benefit the most, while latecomers scramble to catch up. With Popcat‚Äôs explosive debut behind us, the question is: what‚Äôs the next big thing? Enter BTFD Coin. Conclusion: Don‚Äôt Miss BTFD‚Äôs Bull Run Popcat‚Äôs early days offered immense wealth-building opportunities, but not everyone had the foresight or courage to dive in. Today, BTFD Coin stands as the Best Ongoing Crypto Presale , giving investors a second shot at fortune. With its P2E game, staking rewards, referral programme, and festive rollback deal, BTFD offers both excitement and tangible benefits.

PEPE: The deflationary meme coin inspired by Pepe the Frog PEPE is a deflationary meme coin launched on the Ethereum network, inspired by the early 2000s internet meme, Pepe the Frog. It seeks to emulate the success of meme coins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, featuring no transaction taxes and embracing a pure meme coin identity with no utility. In mid-2023, PEPE reached a peak market cap of $1.6 billion, capturing the attention of crypto enthusiasts and sparking a meme coin frenzy. Its roadmap focuses on increasing visibility through social media trends and listings on major exchanges. The coin incorporates a burning mechanism to enhance scarcity and rewards long-term holders, supporting its stability. In the current market cycle, PEPE continues to attract interest due to its strong community and unique features. Shiba Inu: An Ethereum-based meme coin with growing utility Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency launched in August 2020 by an anonymous developer named Ryoshi. Inspired by Dogecoin, SHIB operates on the Ethereum blockchain, enhancing its compatibility within Ethereum‚Äôs ecosystem. The coin started with a total supply of 1 quadrillion tokens, half of which were sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. Buterin donated a significant portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and ‚Äúburned‚Äù 40% of the total supply, reducing circulation. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB aims for broader utility by developing platforms like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and plans for a future NFT platform and governance system. Its integration with Ethereum allows for potential growth in decentralized applications. Conclusion While PEPE and SHIB may offer limited short-term gains, DOGEN is designed for those seeking luxury and success. With expected 700% growth by the end of the presale and the potential for thousand-fold returns during this altcoin season, DOGEN follows successful tokens like BONK, WIF, and Popcat.

The benefits would be captured by a new oracle, a Smart Value Recapture (SVR), which was released on December 23. The SVR oracle will capture profits from maximum extractable value (MEV) to benefit DeFi protocols. At the same time, Aave suggested adding SVR ‚Äúto recapture MEV from Aave liquidations and return it to the Aave ecosystem.‚Äù Blockbuilders have occasionally enjoyed profits from MEV by simply reordering transactions before releasing finished blocks to the public blockchain ledger. Aave plans to redirect 40% of MEV profits to users With Aave, users can use other crypto assets as collateral while borrowing cryptocurrency. However, the user risks forfeiting the collateral if its value declines too much. Part of the proposal reads: Whenever a position needs to be liquidated, [a third-party] liquidator repays some debt and receives the equivalent value in collateral, plus a percentage on top denominated liquidation bonus. The system has been classic, but recently, there has been a problem that calls for an update of the MEV system. The forfeiture or liquidation bonus is a clear and direct chance for MEV to create a good profit for the builder. Yet, in this case, the builder does the minimum. On the contrary, the protocol users receive very little in proportion. This needs rectification. According to Aave, Chainlink‚Äôs SVR is a service that sells, via an MEV-Share auction, ‚Äúthe right to back-run‚Äù Chainlink‚Äôs price-feed oracle and profit from liquidations. To benefit users, the DeFi protocol intends to redirect nearly 40% of MEV profits to Aave DAO. Ethereum users and protocols turn to private transactions for MEV protection Users and protocols are currently protecting against MEV. Most protocols and users across the Ethereum network are deliberately trying to run away from the costs of harmful MEVs. There are a lot of private transactions in Ethereum‚Äôs order flow as users are out to protect trades. Users prefer to go through the dark pool arrangement , sending transactions directly to validators instead of sending orders through the public queue. Private orders are sent to validators directly for protection against MEV.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Ethereum soared in 2017, Solana in 2021 ‚Äî analysts now predict Rexas Finance could deliver 10,000% gains by 2025. Table of Contents Ethereum‚Äôs 2017 ascent Solana: The 2021 sensation Rexas Finance: The next 10,000% altcoin? Why might Rexas Finance be the next major altcoin? Conclusion With excellent profits in 2017, Ethereum changed the scene of distributed apps (dApps) and smart contracts. Then, in 2021, Solana attracted the market‚Äôs interest by blazing blockchain scalability and speed. One issue many investors wonder about as the sector develops is which altcoin will copy these spectacular profits in 2025. One competitor that stands out is Rexas Finance (RXS) , a concept ready to rethink asset tokenization completely. Rexas Finance is a top choice for investors wishing to profit from the next great opportunity since analysts estimate gains of up to 10,000% by 2025. You might also like: Rexas Finance price forecast: where could RXS be in the next 12 months Ethereum‚Äôs 2017 ascent The explosive climb of Ethereum in 2017 was just amazing. Ethereum‚Äôs blockchain‚Äôs release helped distributed apps (dApps), distributed finance (DeFi), and ‚Äî above all‚Äî smart contracts ‚Äî which let developers create programmable assets‚Äîto emerge. Ethereum surged from roughly $8 in early 2017 to over $1,400 by January 2018 due to this invention, generating a tsunami of demand from institutional investors, developers, and regular users. Ethereum‚Äôs success came from its strong ecosystem of projects and developers and its unique capacity to offer a venue for creating distributed apps. Despite significant obstacles, including high transaction fees and scalability problems, Ethereum stayed a prominent participant in the market, and its success encouraged a fresh round of blockchain initiatives. Solana: The 2021 sensation By 2021, Solana became the next major altcoin with significant potential profits. Early investors would find exceptional gains as SOL‚Äôs price skyrocketed from about $1 at the start of the year to over $200 by the year‚Äôs conclusion. The scalability of Solana and the expanding DeFi and NFT ecosystems created on its platform drove its success. Solana is still a prominent player in the blockchain market despite network failures and technical problems in 2022; many think it has great potential for development in the following years. https://twitter.com/rexasfinance/status/1857692542290059502 Rexas Finance: The next 10,000% altcoin? One altcoin that is attracting significant attention as we approach 2025 is Rexas Finance . Rexas Finance addresses a distinct challenge: tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs), while Ethereum and Solana concentrate mainly on dApps and blockchain scalability. The project seeks to tokenize tangible and financial assets, including real estate, commodities, and intellectual property, generating more liquidity and accessibility for investors. Rexas Finance could upset established asset markets using blockchain technology to permit fractional ownership and enable smooth trade of tokenized assets. This invention will democratize access to valuable assets, appealing to regular consumers and institutional investors. The project‚Äôs ecosystem includes a suite of tools for asset tokenization, including the Rexas Token Builder, QuickMint Bot, and the GenAI system, simplifying the process of creating and managing digital assets. The presale performance of Rexas Finance is among its most interesting developments. With tokens valued at $0.15 in Stage 10, Rexas Finance is in the middle of a successful presale as of writing. $29,341,073 has been raised for the presale so far, and early backers of the project are hopeful about its exponential expansion once it launches on tier-1 exchanges in 2025. Being an exciting altcoin for long-term expansion, some analysts estimate RXS might experience a price spike of up to 10,000% by the end of 2025. Why might Rexas Finance be the next major altcoin?

This Viral Layer-1 Presale is Set to Be a Crypto Game-Changer,"The cryptocurrency market has been on fire recently, with new developments shaking up the blockchain landscape. Binance Coin (BNB), the trusted token of the Binance ecosystem, has continued to be a cornerstone in the crypto world. At the same time, an exciting new player, Qubetics ($TICS) , has emerged as a viral Layer-1 project that‚Äôs already breaking records. These two tokens couldn‚Äôt be more different, but they‚Äôre both among the top cryptos to watch right now. Let‚Äôs dive into why Binance Coin is still a favourite for many, and how Qubetics is setting the stage to become a game-changer. Whether you‚Äôre chasing established reliability or early-stage innovation, this comparison will help you decide where to focus your energy. Qubetics ($TICS): The Revolutionary Layer-1 Blockchain Qubetics isn‚Äôt your run-of-the-mill crypto project. As the first Web3 aggregator, it‚Äôs designed to unify blockchain functionalities in a way that no one has done before. Already in its 14th presale stage, Qubetics has sold over 372 million tokens, raising more than $7.5 million from 11,500 holders. Priced at $0.0377 per token, this presale is creating quite the buzz, especially with a 10% price hike set to kick in by the weekend. Analysts are calling Qubetics one of the top cryptos to watch right now, with jaw-dropping ROI predictions. With a $100,000 investment today, you could snag about 2.65 million $TICS tokens. At the projected price of $15 post-mainnet launch, that could turn into a mind-blowing $39.7 million. Cross-Border Payments: Real-Life Solutions for Everyone Imagine a startup in Kenya needing to pay a freelance developer in India. Traditional bank transfers can take days, and fees often eat into profits. With Qubetics, that transaction becomes instantaneous and nearly free. Its cross-border payment feature removes the need for intermediaries, making global payments faster and more affordable. Small businesses, freelancers, and even large corporations stand to benefit. A logistics company in Dubai can now streamline payments to suppliers in Southeast Asia without worrying about fluctuating exchange rates or banking delays. This is what makes Qubetics so revolutionary‚Äîit addresses real-world pain points and bridges gaps left by traditional systems. Why Qubetics is a Must-Watch With its viral presale and practical applications like cross-border payments, Qubetics is poised to reshape the crypto landscape. It‚Äôs not just a token; it‚Äôs a solution. If you‚Äôre looking for the top cryptos to watch right now , Qubetics offers innovation and potential that are hard to match. Binance Coin (BNB): The Reliable Cornerstone Binance Coin has been a staple in the crypto space for years, thanks to its role in the Binance ecosystem. As the utility token of the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency exchange, BNB has maintained its position as a go-to token for traders and developers alike. Trading at $224, it has weathered market volatility better than most, proving its reliability. Binance‚Äôs ongoing expansion, including regulatory compliance and licensing in major markets, has strengthened BNB‚Äôs position. The recent upgrades to Binance Smart Chain (BSC) have added even more use cases, making it a hub for DeFi projects, NFTs, and dApps. Real-World Use Cases Driving Demand Think of Binance Coin as the Swiss Army knife of crypto. From paying lower transaction fees on Binance to participating in token launches, BNB‚Äôs versatility is unmatched. Its integration into the Binance Card and Binance Pay systems allows users to make everyday purchases seamlessly. For instance, someone in New York could buy coffee with BNB, while a traveller in Paris could pay for a hotel stay. The BSC ecosystem is also booming. Developers prefer its low transaction fees and high speeds, making it a popular choice for building decentralised applications. This constant demand ensures BNB remains a top contender among the top cryptos to watch right now. Why Binance Coin Deserves Its Spot Binance Coin‚Äôs strength lies in its stability and utility. While it may not offer the sky-high ROI potential of a presale like Qubetics, its reliability and widespread adoption make it a cornerstone for any diversified portfolio. The Final Thoughts Based on our research and analysis, Qubetics and Binance Coin are both among the top cryptos to watch right now, offering unique benefits tailored to different investment goals. Qubetics represents the thrill of innovation, with its revolutionary Layer-1 blockchain and practical features like cross-border payments. Its viral presale success and staggering ROI potential make it an opportunity that‚Äôs hard to ignore. On the other hand, Binance Coin offers stability and proven utility. Its integration into everyday use cases and its role in the thriving Binance ecosystem make it a solid choice for long-term investors. If you‚Äôre ready to explore the future of crypto, consider joining the Qubetics presale at $0.0377 per token before the price hike this weekend. Whether you prefer the innovation of Qubetics or the reliability of Binance Coin, these two projects are shaping the crypto market in their own unique ways.

Unlike speculative projects like Bonk or storage-based solutions like Filecoin, FXGuys brings real utility to the table. Its focus on trading rewards, staking, and its Trader Funding Program makes it stand out. Let‚Äôs dive into what makes FXGuys the token to watch. What Sets FXGuys Apart? FXGuys is more than just a crypto token. It‚Äôs part of a larger ecosystem designed for traders and investors.

These features show that FXGuys is focused on long-term growth and real-world value, unlike the speculative nature of Bonk or the niche use case of Filecoin. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Why FXGuys Beats Bonk Bonk gained popularity as a meme token, but its value relies on hype and speculation.

The Trade2Earn model ensures that $FXG remains valuable because it‚Äôs tied to actual activity on the platform. Traders earn rewards while adding liquidity and utility to the ecosystem. Bonk might offer short-term spikes, but FXGuys provides sustainable growth, making it a better choice for investors looking to turn $100 into $10,000. Why Filecoin Can‚Äôt Compete Filecoin offers decentralized storage solutions, making it a useful project within its niche. However, its growth depends on enterprise adoption, which can be slow and unpredictable. FXGuys , on the other hand, appeals directly to crypto traders‚Äîa highly active and growing market. The Trader Funding Program attracts professional and retail traders, ensuring consistent demand for $FXG tokens. Filecoin‚Äôs utility is limited to storage, while FXGuys powers trading, staking, and rewards, making it more versatile. How FXGuys Delivers $100 to $10,000 Returns FXGuys combines multiple revenue streams and growth drivers to achieve explosive potential. 1. High Utility The Trade2Earn model ensures that $FXG tokens are in constant demand. As trading activity increases, the token‚Äôs value grows. 2. Staking Opportunities Staking $FXG tokens not only generates passive income but also reduces circulating supply, creating scarcity that drives up prices. 3. Trader Funding Program The funding program brings more traders to the platform, increasing liquidity and overall ecosystem activity. This consistent growth boosts the token‚Äôs long-term value. 4. Community and Adoption FXGuys is attracting both professional and retail traders, creating a diverse and active user base. The more users join the platform, the greater the demand for $FXG tokens. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE The Road Ahead for FXGuys FXGuys isn‚Äôt just about speculation; it‚Äôs about creating real value for users. By offering tools like the Trader Funding Program and staking rewards , it has built an ecosystem that rewards participation. Bonk‚Äôs reliance on hype and Filecoin‚Äôs niche focus can‚Äôt compete with FXGuys‚Äô broader appeal. Investors seeking massive returns should consider FXGuys for its utility, scalability, and market-driven growth. Conclusion FXGuys is a token built for the future. It combines real-world utility, trading rewards, and staking to create an ecosystem that grows with its users. Bonk may capture attention in the short term, and Filecoin serves its niche, but FXGuys offers the best chance to turn $100 into $10,000 .

Amidst this fervor, an intriguing altcoin, RCO Finance (RCOF) , is quietly gaining momentum, promising an astonishing upside that could reach 50,000%. As the Bitcoin price continues to capture headlines with its potential rally toward $150,000, the cryptosphere is also witnessing the emergence of hidden altcoin gems like RCOF, which may redefine investment strategies in this dynamic market. Bitcoin Price Targets $150,000: A Perfect Storm of Catalysts The remarkable Bitcoin price journey in 2024, characterized by a 140% surge and a groundbreaking milestone of $100,000, has set the stage for an even brighter 2025. This rally was fueled by pivotal events, including the launch of Bitcoin Spot ETFs and Bitcoin‚Äôs fourth halving, which reduced block rewards and increased issuance scarcity. Institutional investors eagerly embraced the newly available ETFs, with holdings now accounting for 5% of Bitcoin‚Äôs circulating supply. This institutional demand underscored Bitcoin‚Äôs growing appeal as an asset and a hedge against macroeconomic uncertainty. The pro-crypto political shift in the United States further boosted the Bitcoin price performance. Donald Trump‚Äôs victory in the 2024 presidential election ushered in policies that foster a favorable crypto environment, including a proposed national Bitcoin reserve. Technical analysis forecasts that the Bitcoin price potential will exceed $150,000 in 2025. The convergence of these catalysts has positioned Bitcoin not just as the market leader but as a beacon of transformative financial potential for the years ahead. RCO Finance (RCOF): The Hidden Altcoin Gem Amidst the Bitcoin price projected rally, RCO Finance (RCOF) has emerged as a noteworthy altcoin, attracting attention for its innovative approach to decentralized finance (DeFi). RCOF integrates AI to improve trading strategies, offering real-time market analysis, automated trading, and personalized investment guidance. The platform‚Äôs standout feature is its advanced crypto AI robo-advisor, designed for novice and seasoned investors alike. This tool analyzes individual user profiles, assessing financial goals and risk tolerances to create tailored investment strategies that evolve with market conditions. Unlike conventional trading platforms, which require constant monitoring, RCOF‚Äôs robo-advisor operates autonomously, making real-time portfolio adjustments based on fluctuating market dynamics. RCO Finance sets itself apart with advanced AMM, using AI to automate trades, reduce human error, and optimize execution for consistent returns. Audited by SolidProof, its secure smart contracts improve user confidence in a crypto industry often plagued by fraud, ensuring reliability and efficiency for investors. Another key aspect of RCOF is its expansive access to over 120,000 assets across 12,500 asset classes, including tokenized real-world assets like real estate and commodities. This diversity allows investors to construct well-rounded portfolios that not only mitigate risks but also maximize potential returns. The tokenization of RWAs democratizes investment opportunities previously reserved for institutional players, enabling fractional ownership and opening new avenues for wealth generation. Moreover, RCO Finance offers an impressive leverage option of up to 1,000x, a rarity in the crypto space. This high leverage allows traders to amplify their investments significantly, achieving substantial returns even with smaller capital outlays. Why RCOF Altcoin is the Perfect Investment Option RCO Finance is currently conducting an altcoin presale, allowing early investors to acquire RCOF tokens at a favorable price point. In its fourth presale stage, RCOF altcoins are priced at $0.0777 each, with an additional 25% extra altcoins on purchase using the code RCOF25. Projections suggest that the token value could reach $0.60 at launch, offering early investors over 600% ROI. Beyond presale gains, RCOF token holders may benefit from reduced transaction fees, dividend distributions, and voting rights in governance decisions, providing financial incentives and a voice in the platform‚Äôs development. As the Bitcoin price oscillates towards a $150,000 rally, now is the time to consider diversifying your portfolio with promising projects like RCO Finance, as the altcoin market will follow a similar trend.

38030626,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=631367,1735009200,4 Reasons Why the Price of Lightchain AI Could Reach $2 Over the Next 12 Months,"Lightchain AI (LCAI) is making waves in the crypto market, and investors can‚Äôt help but wonder, How high could this rocket fly? With a presale price that‚Äôs less than your daily coffee fix (under $0.003), LCAI is gearing up to shake things up in both the AI and blockchain worlds. Some experts are throwing out bold predictions, with guesses as high as $2 in just 12 months‚Äîtalk about a glow-up! Let‚Äôs dive into why LCAI might be the next big thing to watch (and maybe invest in). 1. Unique AI-Blockchain Integration with Real-World Use Cases One of the main reasonsÕè for LCAI‚Äôs chance is its special skill to merge smart thinking with block chain tech. This mix makes LCAI different from many other coins in the market. While some projects may look at simple uses like DeFi or NFTs, LCAI brings AI-powered dApps to the block chain. This tech has many uses in the real world, across fields like money, health care, moving things and smart rule making. These areas are quickly using AI tools, and LCAI‚Äôs blockchain setup gives a place for these tools to grow well. As AI gets more and more key in digital change, the need for LCAI‚Äôs new tech will very likely soar, pushing its cost up. 2. Proof of Intelligence (PoI) ‚Äì A Revolutionary Consensus Mechanism Another factor that makes LCAI a strong contender for future growth is its Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism. Unlike traditional consensus mechanisms such as Proof of Stake (PoS) and Proof of Work (PoW), PoI rewards network participants for performing AI computations‚Äîa first for the blockchain industry. By incentivizing meaningful AI tasks such as training machine learning models and running inferences, PoI ensures that the network is both secure and productive. This innovation not only makes LCAI more efficient but also provides tangible real-world value. As more developers and businesses realize the utility of LCAI‚Äôs PoI mechanism, the token could see rapid adoption and a corresponding price increase. 3. Deflationary Tokenomics Driving Long-Term Value LCAI‚Äôs deflationary tokenomics are another key reason why investors believe it could reach $2 within the next year. A portion of transaction fees in the LCAI network is burned, decreasing the total supply of tokens over time. This built-in scarcity mechanism creates upward pressure on the token‚Äôs price as demand increases. The burning of tokens also means that, over time, the total circulating supply of LCAI will be reduced, which can drive long-term value appreciation. As the demand for LCAI increases due to its real-world use cases and technological advancements, the deflationary model will help push the token‚Äôs price higher. 4. Institutional Whale Interest A Sign of Strong Future Growth LCAI has been attracting the attention of institutional investors and whales during its presale . This is a strong indicator of confidence in the token‚Äôs future potential. Large-scale investors typically focus on projects with strong technological foundations, real-world applications, and long-term growth potential. Whale interest in LCAI signals that these investors see a significant upside in the token. As more institutional players enter the market, the price of LCAI could see a dramatic surge, as these whales often control a significant portion of the supply, creating price pressure. Additionally, institutional backing often leads to increased market credibility, encouraging more retail investors to jump on board. LCAI‚Äôs Path to $2 With its unique AI and blockchain integration, innovative PoI consensus mechanism, deflationary tokenomics, and growing institutional interest, LCAI is primed for significant growth. While the current price is still under $0.003, the trajectory points toward substantial upside. With projected growth to $2 within the next 12 months, LCAI could become one of the top-performing assets in the crypto market. As the world continues to embrace AI technology and digital transformation, LCAI could become a major player in this space, making it an exciting token to watch for potential investors.

Some lesser-known digital assets might outperform major players like Solana and TRX by the end of 2024. This article uncovers five small-cap cryptocurrencies that could experience remarkable growth, capturing the attention of investors seeking the next big opportunity. You might also like: ETH and FLOKI set for breakouts, DOGEN smashes records with $4M presale DOGEN: The ultimate meme token for true alphas ready to conquer the market Imagine a life where luxury cars line a driveway, the bank account overflows with cash, and everyone keeps looking. That‚Äôs not just a fantasy ‚Äî that‚Äôs the DOGEN lifestyle. Designed for the ambitious, fearless, and always victorious, DOGEN isn‚Äôt just another meme coin; it‚Äôs the ultimate statement of dominance in the crypto space. HODL like a titan and rule the market DOGEN isn‚Äôt here to play small ‚Äî it‚Äôs here to dominate. With a jaw-dropping 700% surge projected before the presale even wraps up, this token is on track to hit the kind of explosive, thousand-fold gains that meme coins are known for this season. Ready to lead the charge? DOGEN is the opportunity to leave the competition in the dust. Get in early, lock position, and let others watch from the sidelines as early investors climb straight to the top. WIF, Popcat, Ponke? That was then ‚Äî DOGEN is now DOGEN is staking its claim as the alpha of the Solana blockchain, running shoulder-to-shoulder with giants like BONK, WIF, and Popcat; all of which have delivered legendary 1000% gains. This token is still flying under the radar, but not for long. With market trends shifting in its favor, DOGEN is positioned to smash through the charts during this bull run, setting new records and redefining what‚Äôs possible for meme coins. Build a DOGEN empire and get rewarded DOGEN isn‚Äôt just about gains ‚Äî it‚Äôs about building a legacy. The token‚Äôs airdrop campaign gives users the chance to flex an influence and stack massive rewards. All someone needs to do is spread the word on social media, grab tokens during the presale, and use a referral link to recruit others into the DOGEN movement. For every recruit, the user will earn a whopping 20% of their Golden Points from token purchases. The bigger the network, the more substantial their rewards, and the faster they rise to the top. DOGEN isn‚Äôt just another cryptocurrency; it‚Äôs a movement for those bold enough to seize the moment. The presale is heating up, the rewards are stacking high, and the path to dominance has never been clearer. Toncoin (TON): Cryptocurrency of the decentralized open network Toncoin (TON) is the native cryptocurrency of The Open Network, a decentralized, open-source layer-1 blockchain supported by the TON Foundation and community contributors. Initially developed by Telegram as Telegram Open Network with the ‚ÄòGram‚Äô token, the project was discontinued in May 2020 following an SEC court order. Renamed and continued by the community, Toncoin operates on a proof-of-stake consensus model, enhancing scalability and reliability. It aims to provide fast, secure payment services with minimal fees and develop an ecosystem that includes decentralized storage, services, DNS, anonymous networking, and efficient payment processing. Based on historical price movements and BTC halving cycles, Toncoin shows potential for growth, suggesting attractiveness in the current market cycle. Aave: Decentralized lending and borrowing on Ethereum Aave is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to lend, borrow, and earn interest on cryptocurrencies without intermediaries. Using smart contracts, Aave ensures transactions are managed by code rather than institutions. The platform supports 17 cryptocurrencies for lending and borrowing. Lenders receive aTokens, which represent their deposits and earn interest. A unique feature is flash loans, which are instant, require no collateral, and must be repaid within the same blockchain block. AAVE tokens offer benefits like fee reductions and voting rights on protocol changes, and can be used as collateral with added perks. The Safety Module provides a staking mechanism for risk mitigation. With its innovative technology, Aave holds significant potential in the DeFi space. Sui: A scalable and user-friendly Layer-1 blockchain platform Sui is a blockchain platform designed to be secure, scalable, and easy to use. It uses an object-centric data model and the Move programming language to address issues in older blockchain systems. By introducing features like zkLogin and sponsored transactions, Sui aims to make blockchain applications more accessible to users. These innovations could help Sui gain wider adoption in the Web3 space. In the current market cycle, Sui‚Äôs focus on user experience and scalability may make it an attractive option for developers and users seeking efficient blockchain solutions. Aptos (APT): A scalable blockchain focusing on safety and flexibility Aptos (APT) is a new blockchain designed to address high transaction fees and network congestion found in systems like Ethereum before its Proof-of-Stake transition. Developed by Aptos Labs, founded by key contributors from Meta‚Äôs Diem project, it employs a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. Aptos uses the Move programming language for smart contracts, highlighting safety, scalability, and flexibility. It supports a wide range of web3 applications. With its strong development team and focus on solving existing blockchain issues, Aptos has significant potential. In the current market cycle, its innovative approach to scalability and security may make it an attractive option for users and developers. Conclusion Though TON, AAVE, SUI, and APT show promise, they may offer less potential in the short term. DOGEN stands apart for those seeking the best in life, embodying luxury and success. Expected to grow 700% by the end of the presale with potential thousand-fold returns, it follows successful tokens like BONK and Popcat. DOGEN is building a community of leaders, offering real benefits and exclusive perks for early adopters.

38030088,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=632525,1735007821,North Korean hack concerns spark $114M FUD on the Hyperliquid bridge,"Millions of USDC has been moved from Hyperliquid, a decentralized layer 1 exchange that bridges to Arbitrum, a layer 2 network built on Ethereum. This is coming off the back of a series of posts on X (formerly Twitter) by one of the leading voices in crypto security, Tayvano, also known as Tay, who raised concerns about the activities of hackers linked to the Democratic People‚Äôs Republic of Korea (DPRK) on the Hyperliquid bridge. Tayvano‚Äôs post referenced some addresses linked to DPRK hackers who lost over $700,000 in trading on Hyperliquid. The alarm seems to have triggered major FUD in the Hyperliquid community, leading to a movement of over $114 million in USDC from the platform. According to Tayvano, the loss of $700,000 from those trading addresses wasn‚Äôt a mistake but a test to check for vulnerabilities on the platform. She said, ‚ÄúYall, DPRK doesn‚Äôt trade. DPRK tests.‚Äù This isn‚Äôt the kind of news Hyperliquid expects after it recently recorded over $13 billion in a 24-hour trading volume thanks to increased trading activities on its platform fueled majorly by its airdrop event, which happened less than a month ago. Ironically, its liquidity could also be why it popped up on the hackers‚Äô radar. It‚Äôs worth noting that this isn‚Äôt the first time Tayvano has called the attention of the Hyperliquid team to the activities of North Korean hackers on its trading platform. Tay raised an alarm two weeks ago and offered to work with the Hyperliquid team to mitigate the risks DPRK hackers may pose to the platform. A trail of losses due to the Hyperliquid FUD As of this writing, Hyperliquid hasn‚Äôt released any comments, and its token, HYPE, is currently down by over 20%. Two major whales are liquidating close to $4 million of their assets. According to Entropy Advisors on X, Hyperliquid has four validators, and if three of these four validators are compromised, it can lead to a loss of $2.2 billion in USDC across the bridge. While this hasn‚Äôt happened yet and may never happen, the prospect hasn‚Äôt helped quell the ongoing FUD as it calls into question the security of the Hyperliquid platform. It also presents an ongoing issue for bridges in general. Blockchain bridges like Hyperliquid have been touted as the future of on-chain transactions; however, these bridges have been known to be relatively vulnerable to hacks . They account for over 31% of the total value of funds lost to hacks, according to Defillama . Popular bridge hacks such as the Ronin, Binance, and Nomad bridge hacks have resulted in the loss of hundreds of millions. Orbit chain, socket and ALEX bridge are the most recent bridges to suffer hacks and lose millions as a result of cross-chain vulnerabilities that exist on bridges. False alarm or sound advice The alert Tayvano raised has brought other players in the blockchain security space with opposing views into the conversation. Some professionals are advising the Hyperliquid team to look into the concerns Tayvano raised. The other side of the argument has referred to her as a prophet of doom who is deliberately trying to undermine the Hyperliquid team and cause FUD because the team won‚Äôt work with her. An X user (@PixOnChain) observing the impact of Tayvano‚Äôs post on users mentioned that the fear of a potential hack has led to the loss of over $2 billion off Hyperliquid‚Äôs market cap. The X user added that continuous education, collaboration, and strengthened security will help defend against FUDs. In a now-deleted post on X, Jared Grey, the ‚Äúhead chef‚Äù at Sushi Labs, while admitting his respect for Tayvano wrote that he believes that having an open forum to address claims of security issues on any protocol should be encouraged. He believes addressing these issues without generating FUD among users is easy and with the right coordination, attacks will be reduced. DPRK government-sponsored hackers are at the forefront of crypto hacks, accounting for the majority of the crypto thefts recorded. They are reported to have raked in over $1.34 billion from doing that this year alone. These hackers are known to carry out large-scale and small-scale operations, leading to intensified efforts by the US and other governments to clamp down on their activities. The campaign to crack down on these bad actors has led to increased sophistication in North Korean hacker operations, who also invent creative ways of gaining unauthorized access into crypto circles, including as staff members.

One altcoin that is attracting significant attention as we approach 2025 is Rexas Finance . Rexas Finance addresses a distinct challenge: tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs), while Ethereum and Solana concentrate mainly on dApps and blockchain scalability. The project seeks to tokenize tangible and financial assets, including real estate, commodities, and intellectual property, generating more liquidity and accessibility for investors. Rexas Finance could upset established asset markets using blockchain technology to permit fractional ownership and enable smooth trade of tokenized assets. This invention will democratize access to valuable assets, appealing to regular consumers and institutional investors. The project‚Äôs ecosystem includes a suite of tools for asset tokenization, including the Rexas Token Builder, QuickMint Bot, and the GenAI system, simplifying the process of creating and managing digital assets. The presale performance of Rexas Finance is among its most interesting developments. With tokens valued at $0.15 in Stage 10, Rexas Finance is in the middle of a successful presale as of writing. $29,341,073 has been raised for the presale so far, and early backers of the project are hopeful about its exponential expansion once it launches on tier-1 exchanges in 2025. Being an exciting altcoin for long-term expansion, some analysts estimate RXS might experience a price spike of up to 10,000% by the end of 2025. Why might Rexas Finance be the next major altcoin? Rexas Finance‚Äôs unique value proposition and capacity to solve critical issues in the asset management field define its potential for significant returns. By allowing the tokenization of actual assets, Rexas Finance is opening doors for most people, opening previously unreachable investing possibilities. Furthermore, appealing to institutional investors seeking blockchain-based solutions to manage their assets, the project emphasizes security, scalability, and regulatory compliance. Moreover, the success of Rexas Finance‚Äôs presale and expanding community will help indicate its significant expansion in 2025. Because of its constant creativity and emphasis on streamlining asset tokenization, Rexas Finance could be a candidate for the best altcoin with a 10,000% ROI in 2025. Conclusion Rexas Finance could be the next major altcoin to provide tremendous gains in 2025.

If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONALCRY. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/donald-saves-crypto-donalcry-solana-memecoin-will-explode-18000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

38029557,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=666475,1735007425,Dogecoin & Other Memecoins No Longer Grabbing Social Media Attention: Santiment,"The analytics firm Santiment has revealed how social media traders have moved their attention to Bitcoin from Dogecoin and other memecoins recently. Dogecoin & Other Top Memecoins Have Seen A Decline In Social Dominance In a new post on X, Santiment has talked about how cryptocurrency market sentiment on social media has changed amid the latest bearish downturn. The indicator of relevance here is the Social Dominance, which keeps track of the percentage of social media discussions related to the top 100 coins by market cap that a particular asset or group of assets is contributing right now. The indicator measures the degree of discussion or talk related to an asset by counting up the number of posts that are making unique mentions of it. The reason it doesn‚Äôt count up the mentions themselves is that they can provide a false picture of the trend being followed in the sector. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Top Above $168,500 Based On This Indicator, Analyst Reveals Focusing on just the posts means that a few outlier ones with hundreds of mentions can‚Äôt skew the data by themselves and the metric only registers a spike when discussion is spread across the major social media platforms. In the context of the current topic, the Social Dominance of two asset classes is of interest: the Layer 1 Top 6 and the Memecoin Top 6. The former includes the six largest layer 1 networks (that is, blockchains that handle their own security and aren‚Äôt built on top of another network, like Bitcoin) and the latter the six largest meme-based tokens (like Dogecoin). Below is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the Social Dominance for these two types of cryptocurrencies over the last few weeks: As displayed in the graph, the Social Dominance of the Memecoin Top 6 was high a couple of weeks ago, implying social media users were highly interested in Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and other such tokens. Since then, however, the metric has followed an overall downward trajectory for this class of assets. It would appear that investor attention has shifted to Bitcoin and other layer 1 assets, as their combined social dominance has risen during the same period. Historically, whenever Dogecoin and other memecoins have been at the center of attention in the market, it has been a sign that the investors are becoming greedy. Related Reading: XRP Could Be The Altcoin To Recover Quickly, CryptoQuant Analyst Explains Why Cryptocurrency markets generally tend to move against the expectations of the majority, so it may not be a surprise that this greedy sentiment was followed by a downturn in the sector. The shift in Social Dominance to safer investments like Bitcoin would imply the investors are now becoming fearful. It‚Äôs possible that the sector would continue to decline in the coming days, but at least with the sentiment seeing a flip, there is more of a chance that a bottom can be reached. DOGE Price At the time of writing, Dogecoin is floating around $0.31, down more than 24% over the last seven days.

38029291,https://crypto.news/?p=14321748,1735006824,Solaxy presale raises $4.5M for Solana Layer 2 solution ‚Äì next crypto poised to explode,"Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Solaxy nears $5M presale goal, offering low entry prices and high staking APY to early investors on Solana‚Äôs Layer 2. Table of Contents Solaxy presale outperforms similar projects as it gains momentum Solaxy aims to resolve the issues Solana‚Äôs users face Bolstered by robust investor security, Solaxy‚Äôs community sees rapid growth Solaxy (SOLX) is developing a Layer 2 solution to enhance the user experience on Solana , and investors are taking notice. Less than two weeks have passed since the presale started, and the project‚Äôs funds are just $419,000 away from the $5 million mark. Since the project is still in its early stages, investors have a chance to secure their share of SOLX at a low price and benefit from a massive staking APY to maximize their investment. Let‚Äôs take a closer look at this project and what it‚Äôs all about. You might also like: Crypto.com launches U.S. trust company Solaxy presale outperforms similar projects as it gains momentum The Solaxy presale officially opened its doors to early investors on December 12th, and it has already raised over $4.5 million. While the project‚Äôs scope plays its part in attracting investors, Solaxy is featured on Best Wallet‚Äôs Upcoming Tokens section, making it available to the app‚Äôs 100,000+ monthly users and boosting its visibility further. This makes it very similar to Pepe Unchained (PEPU), an Ethereum -based Layer 2 blockchain project that successfully ended its presale phase with over $73 million raised. Once its presale ended, PEPU launched on Uniswap and soared by more than 600% in the first 48 hours, securing listings on LBank, BingX, MEXC, and other exchanges as its price rose. Comparing the early success of these two presales puts Solaxy ahead, as Pepe Unchained took more than a month to raise $4.5 million. https://twitter.com/SOLAXYTOKEN/status/1870529241072173066 To enter the presale, investors can purchase SOLX using BNB, ETH, USDT , or a bank card. No minimum investment is required. Currently, SOLX costs $0.001576 each, but its per-token price will increase in just one day or if the presale raises another $273,000 by tomorrow. If Solaxy keeps its momentum, it could surpass PEPU‚Äôs success and potentially deliver better returns on launch. Solaxy aims to resolve the issues Solana‚Äôs users face Solana is among the top three blockchains by transaction volumes, and its daily transaction count has only increased with pump.fun‚Äôs launch. As such, its ecosystem is prone to network overloads and congestion that can result in failed transactions or slow transaction speeds. Solaxy intends to resolve these issues with its Layer 2 blockchain, which will reduce the burden on Solana‚Äôs Layer 1 chain by bundling up and processing transactions in its stead. This won‚Äôt just make Solana more scalable but also more cost-effective for its users. Plus, the bundled transactions will still be finalized on Solana‚Äôs network, leveraging its robust security. The development of the Solaxy Layer 2 blockchain is in full swing, fueled by 30% of the project‚Äôs total 138 billion token supply. Crypto analyst ClayBro has reminded his 134,000-strong audience on YouTube of the congestion issues Solana users faced in March, April, and June of 2024 during meme coin booms. As he anticipates a meme coin supercycle, ClayBro is impressed by Solaxy‚Äôs goal to improve Solana‚Äôs performance and advises his followers to enter the presale while it‚Äôs in its early stages. Bolstered by robust investor security, Solaxy‚Äôs community sees rapid growth Despite Solaxy‚Äôs ambitious goals and the utility of its upcoming Layer 2 blockchain, it‚Äôs a meme coin first, and as such, its success largely depends on the strength and trust of its community. The project‚Äôs 4-phase roadmap reveals it has a strong focus on community building. Its first phase prioritizes marketing, for which the project allocated 15% of its total token supply, and that has already attracted over 22,000 followers across Solaxy‚Äôs X (Twitter) and Telegram channels. The presale also adopts a dynamic model for staking rewards to encourage early adoption. As more SOLX gets added to the staking pool, the staking yields reduce, which rewards early participants with the best returns. https://twitter.com/SOLAXYTOKEN/status/1867318005660889427 Currently, the project offers an 859% staking APY, allowing investors to nearly 9x their token holdings long-term. Solaxy‚Äôs developers also emphasize investor security, with 10% of the total token supply reserved for liquidity to ensure a safe trading environment. Plus, Coinbase , a security firm, audited the project‚Äôs smart contract and found no issues in its code. Although volatility is as high as ever in the meme coin space, Solaxy stands a solid chance to explode following its DEX launch and the subsequent release of its Layer 2 blockchain.

38028183,https://nulltx.com/?p=136272,1735004732,Over 372M Qubetics Tokens Sold as XRP and SUI Prepare for Explosive Growth,"Best Cryptos to Buy Now With Over 372M Qubetics Tokens Sold at $0.0377 While XRP Targets $3‚Äì$7.5 and SUI Surges 231% The crypto market is buzzing with activity as December 2024 unfolds. XRP, Ripple‚Äôs native token, has seen significant whale activity, suggesting a major price move ahead. Large-scale purchases by whales indicate growing confidence in XRP‚Äôs future, with potential price targets of $3 to $7.5 by 2025. Similarly, SUI, the native token of the Sui Network, has experienced a remarkable surge, with its price pumping 231% over the past year. Dubbed the ‚ÄúSolana killer,‚Äù SUI‚Äôs growth is attracting attention from investors seeking the next big opportunity in crypto. Amidst these developments, Qubetics ($TICS) is making waves by addressing challenges that earlier cryptocurrencies have struggled to overcome. By focusing on user-friendly solutions and seamless integration with existing financial systems, Qubetics aims to make cryptocurrency transactions as straightforward as traditional payment methods. This approach not only simplifies the user experience but also bridges the gap between digital and fiat currencies, fostering broader adoption among businesses and individuals. Qubetics ($TICS): Revolutionizing Digital Transactions Qubetics is on a mission to streamline digital asset management with its Non-Custodial Multi chain Wallet. This innovative wallet integrates seamlessly with major financial platforms like Apple Pay and Google Pay, making crypto transactions as simple as swiping a card. By eliminating the complexities often associated with digital assets, Qubetics is paving the way for everyday use of cryptocurrencies. Imagine a freelancer working with clients worldwide.

This feature protects them from market volatility and ensures they receive the exact amount expected, without the need to manually convert or worry about fluctuating exchange rates. As of now, Qubetics is in its 14th presale stage, having sold over 372 million tokens to more than 11,500 holders, raising upwards of $7.5 million. Tokens are currently priced at $0.0377, with a 10% price increase anticipated in the upcoming 15th stage this weekend. This presents a timely opportunity for investors to join before the next price surge. Ripple (XRP): Whale Activity Signals Potential Surge XRP, the digital asset associated with Ripple, has recently garnered significant attention due to increased whale activity. Large investors have accumulated substantial amounts of XRP, indicating a bullish sentiment and the potential for a significant price movement. For instance, consider a scenario where a major financial institution decides to adopt Ripple‚Äôs technology for cross-border payments. This move could streamline their operations, reduce transaction costs, and expedite processing times. Such real-world applications highlight XRP‚Äôs utility and its potential to revolutionize traditional financial systems. Market analysts have responded to this whale activity with optimistic forecasts for XRP‚Äôs future. Predictions suggest potential price targets of $3 to $7.5 by 2025, based on current accumulation trends and investor confidence. SUI (SUI): A Rising Star in the Crypto Space SUI, the native token of the Sui Network, has been making significant strides in the cryptocurrency market. Over the past year, SUI‚Äôs price has surged by 231%, reflecting growing interest and investment in the platform. Imagine a tech startup looking to develop a decentralized application (dApp) with high throughput and low latency. By building on the Sui Network, they can leverage its scalable infrastructure to deliver a seamless user experience, accommodating a growing user base without compromising performance. Analysts are optimistic about SUI‚Äôs future, with some predicting that the token could reach new all-time highs in the coming months.

Qubetics is simplifying digital transactions with its user-friendly wallet, XRP is showing potential for significant growth due to increased whale activity, and SUI is emerging as a strong contender in the crypto market with its impressive price surge.

38027354,https://nulltx.com/?p=136287,1735003053,Dogen Set for Unprecedented Lift-Off While FLOKI and SHIB Battles Shift Patterns,"An emerging cryptocurrency is gearing up for a remarkable surge, hinting at significant shifts in the digital asset arena. As established tokens grapple with changing trends, attention is turning to this new contender. The developments ahead could alter market perceptions and ignite fresh interest among investors and enthusiasts. DOGEN: The Ultimate Memetoken for Real Alphas Who Always Win Imagine living a dream life ‚Äî posh cars, fat stacks of cash, and women who turn heads. That‚Äôs the DOGEN lifestyle ! If you‚Äôre the kind of guy who‚Äôs always looking to level up, you need to check out DOGEN. This meme token is for the real alphas who always win . HODL Like a Beast, Dominate the Market This thing is about to explode! We‚Äôre talking about a 700% surge before the presale even wraps up ‚Äî and that‚Äôs just the beginning. DOGEN is heating up to those insane thousand-fold gains that memetokens are famous for this season. Get in early, and watch the others try to keep up while you‚Äôre already at the top! Missed Out on WIF, Popcat, or Ponke? DOGEN is the new alpha on the Solana blockchain , running with the big dogs like BONK, WIF, and Popcat ‚Äî all of which blew up with 1000% gains at some point. Right now, DOGEN‚Äôs flying under the radar, but it‚Äôs about to set new records in this bull run. You don‚Äôt want to miss out on this one. Got that DOGEN spirit? Good, ‚Äòcause they‚Äôre holding an airdrop ! All you gotta do is flex on social, stack tokens during the presale, and start building your DOGEN army with your referral link. For every recruit, you‚Äôll be snatching a fat 20% of their Golden Points from token buys. So what are you waiting for? Grab some DOGEN and dominate the crypto world! Floki: From Meme Coin to Utility Token with Real-World Applications Floki, inspired by Elon Musk‚Äôs June 2021 tweet about naming his Shiba Inu ‚ÄúFloki,‚Äù began as Floki Inu coin but has evolved beyond a meme coin. It provides utility and charity, such as building schools in countries like Laos and Nigeria. Recognized by The Economic Times as a top meme coin to buy in 2023, Floki has projects like the NFT metaverse game Valhalla and DeFi service FlokiFi. Its partnership with NOWPayments and the Floki Card allow tokens to be used for real-world transactions. This diversification into NFTs, DeFi, and real-world use differentiates FLOKI from other meme coins. The coin may appear attractive in the current market cycle due to its expanding utility. Shiba Inu (SHIB): An Ethereum-Based Memecoin with Growing Utility Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency launched in August 2020 by an anonymous developer named Ryoshi. Inspired by Dogecoin, SHIB operates on the Ethereum blockchain, enhancing its compatibility within Ethereum‚Äôs ecosystem. The coin started with a total supply of 1 quadrillion tokens, half of which were sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. Buterin donated a significant portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and ‚Äúburned‚Äù 40% of the total supply, reducing circulation. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB aims for broader utility by developing platforms like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and plans for a future NFT platform and governance system. Its integration with Ethereum allows for potential growth in decentralized applications. Conclusion While FLOKI and SHIB show shifting patterns and may have less short-term potential, DOGEN emerges as a standout. Designed for those seeking luxury and success, DOGEN anticipates 700% growth by presale‚Äôs end, with potential for massive returns. Following successful tokens like BONK, DOGEN builds a community of market leaders, offering real benefits and exclusive perks for early adopters.

Among the many players in this space, Qubetics , Tron, and Immutable X stand out for their distinct approaches and recent developments. Each of these altcoins offers unique insights into the evolving blockchain landscape. Here‚Äôs an in-depth look at their current status and potential. Qubetics: Transforming Financial Interactions Through Blockchain Qubetics is positioning itself as a leader in blockchain innovation with a mission to revolutionise how financial transactions occur. By offering a secure, user-friendly, and inclusive platform, Qubetics allows individuals and institutions to manage tokenised assets effortlessly while conducting efficient cross-border payments . Its goal is to redefine global finance through accessible financial services, tokenised asset trading, and innovative payment solutions. In Presale Phase 14 , Qubetics has captured significant attention due to its structured presale model. Weekly phases see a 10% price increase, and the final stage promises a 20% hike, creating a sense of urgency for early investors. Priced at $0.037 per $TICS token, the project has raised over $7.5 million, boasts more than 11,500 holders, and sold 372 million tokens. The anticipated post-presale price of $0.25 signals an ROI of 630% for current buyers, making it an enticing opportunity. Analysts further predict that the token could rise to between $10 and $15 after the mainnet launch, highlighting its long-term potential. With a clear vision, strong presale momentum, and a strategic roadmap, Qubetics is a project to watch closely in blockchain. Tron (TRX): Challenges Amidst Market Pressure Tron, once a prominent player in the DeFi space, has recently faced significant hurdles. Its native token, TRX, has been on a consistent downward trajectory, recording a 10.56% loss over the past week. The decline has raised concerns among investors, especially as the network struggles to compete with Ethereum in the supply of USDT. Tether‚Äôs recent minting activities have seen Ethereum secure a larger share of the $2 billion in USDT issued since early November, leaving Tron behind. This shift has added to the mounting challenges TRX faces, further diminishing its appeal in the eyes of investors. Adding to the pressure, large-scale holders or ‚Äúwhales‚Äù increasingly highlight newer projects like Lunex Network, which offer high growth potential. While Tron‚Äôs robust infrastructure and active community suggest that it retains the capacity for recovery, the network must innovate and address these challenges to regain investor confidence and market relevance. Immutable X (IMX): Volatility Ahead of Token Unlock Immutable X, a blockchain platform based in Sydney, Australia, has established itself as a leading Ethereum Layer 2 solution specialising in NFTs and gaming. However, the platform faces significant price volatility as it approaches a major token unlock event. Immutable X plans to release 24.5 million IMX tokens, valued at over $33 million, as part of its tokenomics strategy. This monthly release, a standard feature of the project‚Äôs design, introduces additional supply to the market, often leading to downward price pressure. IMX‚Äôs price has declined to its lowest since November 21, falling below critical support levels. Analysts predict further declines leading up to the unlock event on December 27, with the token potentially approaching a support zone around $1.1720. A Diversified Approach to Investing The stories of Qubetics, Tron, and Immutable X underscore the diversity of opportunities within the cryptocurrency market. Qubetics offers a promising presale phase with exceptional ROI potential and a transformative vision for blockchain-based financial services. Tron‚Äôs challenges reflect the competitive nature of the DeFi sector, yet its infrastructure and community offer hope for a turnaround. Despite short-term volatility, Immutable X continues to innovate in the NFT and gaming space, making it a key player in these expanding industries. Investors must assess their risk tolerance, investment goals, and market trends to make informed decisions about these altcoins. As the blockchain ecosystem evolves, these projects highlight cryptocurrencies‚Äô dynamic possibilities.

Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum (ETH) has experienced notable price shifts in recent times. Over the past week, its value dropped by 15.25%, marking a significant decline. In the last month, the price decreased by 2.48%, and over six months, it edged down by 2.16%. Currently, Ethereum trades within a range of $3648.43 to $4137.17, reflecting the volatility in the market. Technical indicators hint at possible future movements for Ethereum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 38.07, approaching oversold levels, suggesting a potential rebound. The Stochastic indicator stands at 21.50, also indicating an oversold condition. However, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) level is -21.52, showing bearish momentum. The price hovers near its 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages of $3331.27 and $3461.32, respectively. Ethereum‚Äôs immediate resistance level is at $4318. If the price breaks above this point, it could aim for the second resistance at $4807, an increase of around 11%. On the downside, the nearest support is at $3340.38. A drop below this could lead to the second support level at $2851.64, a decrease of about 15%. Given the current indicators and support levels, Ethereum may be poised for a turnaround or further decline, making this a critical juncture for the asset. XRP (XRP) Over the past six months, XRP has seen a remarkable increase of 366.94%. This significant rise reflects strong interest and trading activity around the cryptocurrency. In the last month, XRP‚Äôs price climbed by 77.14%, showcasing a robust upward trend. However, the past week experienced a dip of 7.81%, indicating some short-term volatility. Currently, XRP is trading between $2.03 and $2.73. The nearest resistance level is at $3.02, a point that, if surpassed, could lead to testing the second resistance at $3.73. On the other hand, the nearest support lies at $1.61, with a secondary support at $0.9041. These levels are key indicators of potential price movement in either direction. Technical indicators present a mixed picture. The 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages are close, at $2.24 and $2.28 respectively, suggesting the market is consolidating. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 42.72, indicating that XRP is neither overbought nor oversold. The MACD level is slightly negative at -0.0059, which could point to a mild bearish sentiment. Monitoring these indicators can provide insight into XRP‚Äôs potential price direction in the near future. Solana (SOL) SOL has faced notable price shifts recently. In the past week, its price dropped by 18.80%, and over the last month, it decreased by 30.50%. Despite these declines, Solana has grown by 34.97% over the past six months. The current trading range is between $205.85 and $239.87, showing significant volatility. Technical indicators suggest the bearish trend might persist. The RSI is at 38.29, nearing oversold levels. The MACD is negative at -1.376, and the Stochastic oscillator is low at 26.34. These figures point towards potential further declines, but they could also hint at an upcoming reversal if buyers step in. Solana‚Äôs nearest support is at $188; falling below this could lead to a drop to the next support at $154. On the upside, resistance levels are at $256 and $290. To reach the first resistance, Solana needs to rise by about 8%. A decline to the nearest support means a decrease of around 10%. The 10-day SMA is $182.89, and the 100-day SMA is $193.52, indicating recent prices are above average. Conclusion Though ETH, XRP, and SOL are promising, XYZVerse (XYZ) uniquely merges sports and memes, positioning itself for significant growth in the current bull run.

JasmyCoin (JASMY) Imagine having full control over your personal data and deciding how it‚Äôs used. JasmyCoin (JASMY) is a project from a Tokyo-based company called Jasmy Corporation that aims to make this possible. They specialize in the Internet of Things (IoT), connecting devices like computers, cars, and phones. By combining IoT with blockchain technology, Jasmy creates a secure platform where users can safely store and exchange their data. In this system, your personal information becomes your own asset, and you have the power over it. In today‚Äôs market, data privacy is more important than ever. JasmyCoin stands out by focusing on protecting individual data rights. Unlike some other coins that prioritize speed or scalability, JASMY puts data ownership front and center. This aligns with a growing trend where people want more control over their digital lives. As concerns about data security rise, a coin that empowers users could draw more interest. While the crypto market is always changing, JasmyCoin‚Äôs unique approach to data democratization makes it an intriguing player to watch. Pepe (PEPE) PEPE is a new player in the cryptocurrency world, born from the popular Pepe the Frog meme created by Matt Furie. Launched on the Ethereum blockchain, this deflationary memecoin has captured the attention of many. It follows in the footsteps of other meme-based cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. By embracing its meme origins and keeping things simple with a no-tax policy and being upfront about its lack of utility, PEPE appeals to those who enjoy the fun side of crypto. In late April and May of 2023, PEPE‚Äôs value skyrocketed, reaching a market cap of $1.6 billion at its peak. Early investors saw huge gains, and a strong community formed around it. This surge sparked what some call a ‚Äúmemecoin season,‚Äù with new memecoins popping up and experiencing wild price swings. PEPE‚Äôs roadmap includes plans for major exchange listings and aims for a ‚Äúmeme takeover.‚Äù Whether PEPE will reach new heights remains uncertain, but with the upcoming Bitcoin halving and hopes for a Bull Run, many are watching closely. For those intrigued by meme coins and high-risk, high-reward opportunities, PEPE might be an attractive option in the current market. Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) Artificial Superintelligence Alliance is an innovative project founded in 2017 and launched on Binance in 2019. It‚Äôs building an open, decentralized machine learning network powered by blockchain technology. Fetch.ai aims to make AI accessible to everyone through a permissionless network. This allows anyone to connect and use secure datasets with autonomous AI agents performing tasks across its global data network. Applications include optimizing DeFi trading, improving transportation systems, enhancing smart energy grids, and revolutionizing travel‚Äîany complex system relying on large-scale data. With its unique blend of AI and blockchain, Fetch.ai has significant potential. In the current market, the coin looks promising, especially as interest in AI and decentralization grows. Price predictions suggest FET could gain value in the coming years, reaching over $1 by 2025 and $1.19 by 2030. Compared to other AI-focused coins like SingularityNET or Ocean Protocol, Fetch.ai stands out with its autonomous agents and practical applications. As demand for AI solutions increases, Fetch.ai might be a project to watch in the evolving crypto landscape. Stellar Lumens (XLM) Stellar Lumens (XLM) is changing the way money moves around the globe. Founded in 2014, Stellar is a decentralized network that uses blockchain technology to make sending funds fast and affordable. It doesn‚Äôt pick favorites among currencies. Instead, it allows people to transfer any type of money, whether it‚Äôs a national currency or a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. Over the years, Stellar has processed billions of transactions and teamed up with major companies. With Stellar apps, individuals can send money worldwide, and businesses can build their own blockchain tools or use the network for payments and currency exchanges. Unlike many other cryptocurrencies that aim to replace traditional financial systems, Stellar wants to work with them. It offers a platform where different financial systems can collaborate. This approach sets it apart in the current market, where cooperation is becoming more important. The Stellar Development Foundation, supported initially by Stripe, helps promote the network‚Äôs use. It works on projects like NFT creation and smart contracts. As the crypto market evolves, Stellar‚Äôs focus on bridging old and new financial worlds might make it stand out among other coins. Its technology and partnerships could play a key role in the future of global finance. Conclusion Though JASMY, PEPE, FET, and XLM hold promise, XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out as a pioneering memecoin uniting sports fans and targeting massive growth.

Daddy Pepe (DADDPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 11,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DADDPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Daddy Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Daddy Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Daddy Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Daddy Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Daddy Pepe by entering its contract address ‚Äì 9UFnMabUe7wecdEEzAYPoQPZiuTJ1hTFpNz6qtsiB3FA ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DADDPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | SHIB | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/daddy-pepe-daddpepe-solana-memecoin-to-rally-11000-ahead-of-exchange-listing-as-shib-wif-and-doge-underperform/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

38026829,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=313860,1735002029,Ethereum and Altcoins Gearing Up for Explosive Move As ETH Mirrors December 2020 Structure: Jason Pizzino,"A widely followed crypto analyst says that Ethereum and altcoins are bracing for a swing to the upside as ETH prints the same pattern it did in 2020. In a new video update, crypto strategist Jason Pizzino tells his 344,000 YouTube subscribers that the Ethereum/Bitcoin (ETH/ BTC ) pair is flashing a ‚Äúmajor altcoin signal.‚Äù However, he warns that altcoins still have a bit further to drop before market sentiment turns around and sparks a rally. ‚ÄúETH/BTC in November got a bounce but again it still has not broken past at least the 4% level and the major level that I‚Äôm watching for an overbalance in price here is 0.046 [BTC]. That‚Äôs going to give us an overbalance in price to the upside and ideally if [the 0.032 BTC] low isn‚Äôt taken out, it‚Äôll be overbalanced in time as well and that would be that major altcoin signal, when everyone has that extreme greed, the excitement and the belief that these markets are just not going to come back down. We‚Äôre still not there yet so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs too crazy to think that we‚Äôd see further at least consolidation but until that happens, you‚Äôre probably not going to get that same extreme excitement to the upside.‚Äù According to the trader, ETH/BTC is mirroring the same pattern it did in 2020 before taking off. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs similar to what happened in December of 2020 and what followed December 2020 is your massive January bar: big, big volume, big reversal‚Ä¶ So we have a look back to January [2021]. Y ou start to see that volume really pick up early on and just come back out of nowhere. You can see [December 27th, 2020] it started to pick up and [on] the 3rd of January [2021], [a] nice big move. Third and fourth [of January], [ETH/BTC] starts to break those tops and then consolidate above those support levels. You can see they‚Äôre around 3% and then it started to move again ‚Äì sure it came back down, but that gives you the overbalance that you‚Äôre looking for, meaning more buyers for a longer period of time and they‚Äôre holding the price up. That‚Äôs exactly what we need to see, and we haven‚Äôt seen it yet with the ETH/BTC chart.‚Äù ETH/BTC is valued at 0.0342 BTC ($3,264.68) at time of writing.

38025883,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=666513,1735000209,Bitcoin‚Äôs Key SOPR Metric Holds Steady: Are Long-Term Holders Eyeing Higher Prices?,"Bitcoin has continued to see declining performance in recent days with on-chain metrics offering valuable insights into market behavior. Among these metrics, the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) for long-term holders has particularly emerged as a critical tool for assessing investor sentiment and market resilience. Long-term holders, defined as investors holding Bitcoin for over 155 days, are often viewed as a stabilizing force in the market. Their selling patterns can significantly influence price trends, making SOPR an indicator worth watching. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Leverage and Coinbase Premium: What Recent Data Reveals Long-Term Holder Trends And Market Sentiment Recent analysis from a CryptoQuant analyst known as Cryptoavails highlights that Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term holder SOPR metric continues to exhibit notable patterns as Bitcoin‚Äôs price trends upward. Historically, SOPR values above 1 indicate that long-term holders are selling at a profit, while values below 1 suggest they are offloading their holdings at a loss. This behavior reflects broader market confidence or capitulation during periods of price decline. Currently, the SOPR metric remains consistently above 1, signaling that long-term holders are selling profitably without adding significant downward pressure on Bitcoin‚Äôs price. The analysis from Cryptoavails tracks key phases in the Bitcoin market over the past two years, highlighting significant shifts in SOPR values. For instance, in early 2022, the SOPR metric showed high volatility with frequent spikes, suggesting intense profit-taking activity by long-term holders. Amid these sales, Bitcoin‚Äôs price experienced a downward trend, reflecting persistent selling pressure during that period. This trend gradually shifted in late 2022 and early 2023 when the SOPR metric mostly remained below 1, indicating that long-term holders were selling at a loss as the market sought to find stability. By mid-2023, the SOPR began trending upwards, signaling renewed confidence among long-term investors. The metric consistently moved closer to or above the critical level of 1, suggesting that long-term holders were once again selling at a profit while market confidence began to recover. This upward trend has remained intact into 2024, supported by Bitcoin‚Äôs rising price levels. Importantly, there have been no significant sell-offs by long-term holders, reinforcing the broader market‚Äôs stability, according to the crypto analyst. SOPR As A Forward Indicator For Market Growth Overall, Cryptoavails¬†mentioned that the current state of Bitcoin‚Äôs SOPR suggests a healthy market dynamic, with long-term holders contributing to a stable price structure. Despite periodic corrections, the sustained presence of SOPR above 1 indicates that selling pressure remains controlled. Related Reading: What‚Äôs The Worst Case Scenario For Bitcoin Right Now? Analyst Explains The analyst also pointed out that this behavior reflects market maturity, where long-term investors are not rushing to offload their holdings despite Bitcoin‚Äôs price appreciation. Regardless, Bitcoin has continued to consistently decrease in price since its sharp drop below $100,000 last week. At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at a price of $93,991 down by 1.6% in the past 24 hours.

38025659,https://cryptonews.com/?p=322221,1734999492,Dogecoin‚Äôs Third Leap Incoming? Analyst Predicts Explosive Rally After Dip,"Dogecoin (DOGE) could be in for a prolonged period of pain, following by an explosive rally starting in April 2025. That‚Äôs according to the analysis of X user Master Kenobi, who outlined this interesting take in a recent tweet. What if DOGE‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶is gearing up for its third and final leap in such a scenario? A slow drop until April 15, followed by a strong pump starting May 5, reaching its peak around mid-August? Not saying it will happen, but it caught my eye, and I thought I'd share it with you‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/M2kcNs7JPT ‚Äî Master Kenobi (@btc_MasterPlan) December 21, 2024 Master Kenobi looked at the price action of Dogecoin in 2024, where it saw a surge to highs in the $0.23 area, before then stagnating for months ahead of a breakout in the final final months of 2025 to new yearly highs above $0.40. If this price pattern repeats, that could mean Dogecoin is in for a period of stagnation until mid-April, before then breaking out again around the mid-point of next year. Could a Dogecoin Rally Come Sooner? Its an interesting theory. But the Dogecoin bulls will be pleased to hear that risks are very much tilted in favor of the Dogecoin price rallying much sooner than next April. Why? The facetiously named Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) , headed by none other than Elon Musk (an ardent Dogecoin supporter for years now) is set to officially land in Washington in January. Incoming US President Donald Trump , whose administration is set to be the most pro-crypto in history, has given DOGE a mandate to reduce fraud and waste in government spending. Musk is already having an impact in Washington ‚Äì his vocal criticisms on X of a recent Congressional spending bill resulted in the bill being reduced from over 1500 pages in length to a little over 100. Expect D.O.G.E to dominate the headlines in 2025, all but ensuring that Dogecoin retains a commanding portion of mindshare in the meme coin markets . That means as the Trump trade returns to lift crypto prices higher, as is likely in the coming weeks, DOGE will be a prime candidate to outperform. However, chart analysis continues to point to downside risks for the Dogecoin price, for now. Last around $0.32, Dogecoin fell under its 21 and 50DMAs following its price collapse last week. And DOGE is yet to retest its early 2024 highs in the $0.23 area, which will be a key target for the bears. Chart analysis suggests DOGE could be headed lower in the short term. However, if it does reach the low $0.20s, it could be a great coin to buy on the dip. With Dogecoin likely to vault above $1.0 and post gains in the 5x region this bull market, it‚Äôs a strong candidate for best crypto to buy now . Dogecoin Alternative to Consider ‚Äì Flockerz (FLOCK) While Dogecoin could do very well in 2025, there are many smaller, lesser-known meme coins that could post far larger gains. The team at crypto news.com keeps a close eye on the meme coin market as they hunt for high-potential projects. And one new meme coin they like a lot is an exciting new DAO-powered vote-to-earn meme coin called Flockerz (FLOCK) . Big Announcement for The Flock In just 30 days the Flockerz presale will end. This is your last chance to get in on the ground floor, to grab your share of the presale head on over to: https://t.co/HKN509Un5J It's time to join The Flock! pic.twitter.com/OWkEzSXu3u ‚Äî Flockerz (@FlockerzToken) December 23, 2024 One of the reasons analysts at crypto news.com are so excited about this token is the impressive pace at which is has been raising funds from earlier investors. Despite only launching a few weeks ago, Flockerz (FLOCK) has already attracted over $7.6 million from eager buyers. Couple that with its impressive social media metrics, and this token is looking like a meme coin that could really pop. With new meme coins like Fart Coin recently hitting a $1 billion market cap, the appetite for novel new meme coins appears elevated. FLOCK could easily become one of the best meme coins to launch in 2024. ClayBro outlines in the video below why he thinks FLOCK is set to launch at the perfect time, just ahead of a new meme season.
