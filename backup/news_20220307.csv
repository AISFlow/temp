Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and other major cryptos decline.  Insights: Malaysia has the ingredients to become Asia's next crypto hub.  Technician's take: BTC appears to be oversold on intraday charts, although momentum has weakened.

Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $38,311 .2%  Ether (ETH): $2,510 -1.7%  Top Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Cosmos ATOM +1.8% Smart Contract Platform XRP XRP +0.0% Currency  Top Losers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Chainlink LINK −4.3% Computing Polkadot DOT −3.2% Smart Contract Platform Cardano ADA −2.8% Smart Contract Platform  Bad news continued flowing from the Ukraine on Monday, pushing investors away from cryptocurrency and other higher-risk assets.  At the time of publication, bitcoin was trading at about $38,300, off slightly over the past 24 hours. Ethereum was changing hands just above $2,500, down 1.7%. Most other major cryptos were firmly in the red. It was the third consecutive day of crypto declines, which started late on Friday as faint hopes for a ceasefire or targeted truce to allow civilians to evacuate besieged cities evaporated.  Ukrainian civilian casualties mounted as Russia continued to bomb non-military targets. Delegations from the Ukraine and Russia failed in their latest attempt to negotiate safe passage for citizens of the Black Sea port of Mariupol and other major Ukraine cities that are under bombardment.  Investors worried about rising energy prices that have already increased significantly over the last few months and wider inflationary pressures. The average price of gasoline rose to $4.009 per gallon on Sunday, according to the travel and other services organization, American Automobile Association (AAA). That was not far off the all-time high of $4.11 set in July 2008.  Oil is a tax on everything,"" Ben McMillan, the chief investment officer for IDX Digital Assets, told CoinDesk TV's First Mover show Monday. ""Oil at this level, which we haven't seen for more than 10 years is just a drag on economies globally. So I think the big question really is 'how bad does this war get, how long does it persist.'""  The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite fell 3.6% and the S&P 500 nearly 3% as equity markets slogged through their worst day in over a year.  McMillan noted that bitcoin had ""priced in a lot of bad news"" and that ""the war in Ukraine certainly didn't help."" But he also struck a somewhat upbeat note, highlighting investors recent preference for the two largest cryptos by market cap, bitcoin and ether, over other digital assets.  ""We are at a period now below $40,000 where historically we've started to see the buyers come out of the woodwork,"" he said. ""The structural bull case is intact. I think part of that is there was a migration or consolidation within the crypto sphere around core holdings of Bitcoin and Ethereum.""  Markets  S&P 500: 4,201 -2.9%  DJIA: 32,817 -2.3%  Nasdaq: 12,830 -3.6%  Gold: $1,998 +1.3%  Insights  Is Malaysia the Future Crypto Hub for Asia?  Financial centers usually need three things: nice weather, common law and a bilingual workforce.  When people think of financial centers in Asia, Hong Kong or Singapore usually come to mind. The two cities share a lot of similarities as they retain a common law court system, and the workforce has a high command of English as artifacts of Britain’s legacy of colonialism.  Singapore is often called Asia’s crypto hub, and that term makes sense on the surface. The Monetary Authority of Singapore’s regulatory framework has been thought of as a comprehensive approach to crypto that understands the unique complexity of the asset class while Hong Kong takes a fragmented approach that often feels like there’s a square peg in a round hole happening despite everyone’s best efforts.  But we’re forgetting about Malaysia. Also a former Crown colony, Malaysia retains the institutional use of English as well as a common law court system. There’s no erosion of this legacy like in Hong Kong, the beaches are better than Singapore and the cost of living is low.  Yes, Malaysia isn’t spotless and graft-free like the Lion City but it didn’t have Gigachad Lee Kuan Yew at the helm to fight corruption. Sovereign wealth funds get raided (to bankroll the Wolf of Wall Street no less) and police take the occasional bribe. But they know it's wrong and people get prosecuted; parties get tossed at the ballot box in their raucous democracy.  The judicial DNA is in the right place, and the ""bones"" of the system are solid. A land title, for example, is secure through the use of the Torrens system of title, another fine commonwealth legacy that enshrines property rights through professional surveying and a central registry not a mishmash of fiefdoms. Singapore and Malaysia used to be one, in fact, until Malaysia’s parliament voted to expel the island from their confederation making Singapore the only country to gain independence involuntarily (take that, Taiwan).  One key thing Malaysia has going for it, with the British common law in place, is its ability to pull in case law (law that is based on judicial decisions) when making a regulatory decision. Because of its clarity, case law is always a preferred method of dealing with an evolving landscape that statute or regulation isn’t a precise enough tool to hit. Lawyers who specialize in regulatory affairs in common law jurisdictions get a bit uneasy when authorities decide to use statute to rule by enforcement.  This seems to be going well for Fusang, based in Malaysia’s Labuan territory. Labuan, formed in 1990, is being marketed as Malaysia’s Hong Kong, a midshore jurisdiction that’s in the country but exempt from some of its rules and tax burden. Labuan was a bit underground and not well known until Fusang put it on the map with its digital equities and bond offerings.  “Paper shares today, digital shares tomorrow” is how its CEO Henry Chong puts it, explaining that this isn’t a novel asset class in need of a new set of rules. Clarity is already there, because there are existing securities rules.  Chong thinks there is plenty of clarity on the market about digital assets. Those that say otherwise are complaining about having to follow the rules.  But what Malaysia doesn’t have is the sophisticated capital market of Hong Kong. Kuala Lumpur isn’t synonymous with being a financial center the same way that Hong Kong is. Singapore, looking at the numbers, isn’t even there either.  “In the digital world, geography starts to matter a lot less. Financial centers typically grew up around geography – Hong Kong is a prototypical example. There’s proximity there,” Chong said. “Hong Kong became Hong Kong because people wanted to meet and interact.”  Jurisdictions will start competing more, Chong said, and the case is there for Malaysia to become this next hub.  Chong isn’t the first one to champion this. CoinGecko, a fierce competitor to CoinMarketCap, was founded in Malaysia and continues to operate there while maintaining a presence in Singapore. Malaysia remains free of capital gains tax on crypto, and its educated, English-speaking workforce is quickly making a good impression on stakeholders in the decentralized finance (DeFi) industry.  Hong Kong’s response to COVID-19 has caused a mass exodus that might just be Malaysia’s gain. Published statistics show that since March 2020, 76,000 more people have left the city than arrived, and the tempo of departures has increased in the last week as the City tries to enforce its most restrictive covid rules yet (even its most vocal fans are deciding now is the time to go).  Some are headed back to Europe, others for a staycation in Thailand, and perhaps some to Malaysia. Work will still be the order of business, as remote working is the norm. But the question is, how many will return? This could be what it takes for the industry to consider decentralizing – especially to areas that share the same legal DNA.  Technician's take  Bitcoin Holding Support Above $35K-$37K, Resistance at $45K  Bitcoin (BTC) traded lower over the weekend after buyers were unable to break above the $40,000 price level. Immediate support is at $37,000, which could stabilize the pullback, although stronger support is seen at $35,000.  The cryptocurrency continues to trade in a tight price range and is down 2% over the past 24 hours to about $38,000.  Upside momentum is slowing on the daily chart, which points to further consolidation around the current price. Resistance is seen at $45,000.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the four-hour chart is rising from oversold levels, similar to what occurred during the last week of February, which preceded a price jump. Still, the RSI can remain in oversold territory for a few days before confirming an upswing (typically with a reading above 50).

It is still one of the most promising investment options in the space with growth speculated to skyrocket in the next five years. Through all of the recent downtrend, there have been widespread concerns that the cryptocurrency has officially entered another stretched-out bear market. Not everyone subscribes to this school of thought, however. The current bearish climate does nothing to deter bulls as there are still various scenarios that put bitcoin in another bull trend. The one discussed in this article sees the digital asset growing at least another 300% before the expected decline to the $20K level. Bitcoin At $165K The argument that bitcoin is headed for the $20K range is stronger now more than ever following another decline below $40K. There is still significant support for the asset at the $36k-$38k level but with the sell-offs and bears working overtime to pull down the price, expectations have skewed largely in favor of seeing bitcoin touch below $30,000 in the near term.

Lately, the industry has been able to attract potential investors from all around the world, establishing its global reach. What is COVAL? COVAL, also known as Circuits of Value, is a pretty well-known cryptocurrency that uses Proof of the mechanism of Work consensus and many algorithms to mine the latest coins. It works similarly to the popular cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. Found in November 2014, COVAL (Circuits of Value) is an Ethereum token that ultimately powers Emblem. Wondering what that is now? The emblem is a platform that lets users create an amalgamation of ERC-20, ETH, and NFT tokens to form a single and tradeable currency called Vault.

42375185,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw69Bj,1646689086,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Dips; Trading Range Could Result in Sharp Price Swings,"Bitcoin (BTC) remained below $40,000 on Monday as selling pressure intensified. Equities also traded lower amid Russia's increasing attacks on Ukraine.  Talks among U.S. officials of a potential ban on Russian oil imports triggered a surge in energy prices over the past few days. Higher prices at the pump could lead to slower economic growth and lower stock prices.  In crypto markets, bitcoin was down 3% over the past 24 hours, compared to a 5% drop in ether (ETH). Trading volume remains low, and analysts noticed a loss of short-term buying pressure, which could point to limited upside in prices.  Still, sentiment and technical indicators are neutral, which typically precede a pickup in volatility.  Latest prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $37933, −3.54%    ●Ether (ETH): $2485, −6.04%    ●S&P 500 daily close: $4201, −2.95%    ●Gold: $2001 per troy ounce, +1.85%    ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 1.75%     Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Trading the range  Bitcoin's year-long trading range between $28,000 and $69,000 has been eventful. A mix of economic, regulatory and geopolitical headlines triggered 20%-50% price swings, which left some buyers on the sidelines.  Typically, price ranges benefit short-term traders who enter positions at support and resistance levels, aiming to profit when the price returns to its midpoint.  The chart below shows the most recent price range between $34,000 and $45,000. Peaks in trading volume are seen at support/resistance, indicating a high level of activity with buying or selling strength. Additionally, transaction activity on the Bitcoin blockchain confirms spikes in supply and demand at key technical levels.  For now, some analysts expect the trading range to persist over the short term.  ""Crypto markets will need to see a period of stabilization in the next two or three months before a more sustainable recovery can get under way,"" David Duong, head of institutional research at Coinbase (COIN), wrote in a report. The next major move in crypto could occur once investors have greater clarity on central bank policy and geopolitical events, according to Duong.  Sentiment among crypto traders has been bearish throughout the recent price range.  The chart below shows the bitcoin Fear & Greed Index, which has remained in ""fear"" territory over the past three months, which could leave bitcoin vulnerable to volatility shocks. (The index runs from 0 to 100, with ""fear"" between 0 and 49 and ""greed"" between 50 and 100.)  ""With prices trading sideways in recent weeks, a relative equilibrium has been established,"" Glassnode, the crypto data firm, wrote in a blog post. ""However, given the limited incoming fresh demand, this delicate balance can be disrupted by any significant degree of seller exhaustion, or conversely a re-invigoration of sellers.""  Crypto inflows tripled last week  Fresh investment inflows into crypto funds tripled last week to the highest in almost three months, despite outflows from European products.  Digital-asset investment funds attracted $127 million of new money during the week through March 4, a report Monday from digital-asset manager CoinShares showed. The regional breakdown comprised $151 million of inflows in the Americas and outflows of $24 million in Europe.  Bitcoin funds saw inflows of $95 million last week, the most since early December. Meanwhile, ether funds saw minor inflows of $25 million, the most in 13 weeks.

42421649,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXotW1,1646684465,ENS and the Limitations of DAO Governance,"Last month, Twitter sleuths uncovered a cache of homophobic and transphobic posts from Brantly Millegan, one of three directors of the Ethereum Name Service Foundation (ENS), roiling the crypto community.  “Homosexual acts are evil. Transgenderism doesn’t exist. Abortion is murder. Contraception is perversion. So is masturbation and porn,” read one of Millegan’s tweets from May 2016.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Responding to backlash, Millegan doubled down, chalking up the perspective to his Catholic faith. “Nice to see some ppl finally read the first word of my bio,” he wrote (his Twitter bio says “Catholic, husband, father”).  It was enough to get him fired from his position as director of operations at True Names Limited, the Singapore-based nonprofit that organizes and funds the Ethereum Name Service. After two days of deliberation, Nick Johnson, Millegan’s boss at True Names and the founder of ENS, said he felt Millegan’s position was “no longer tenable.”  The catch is that while Millegan had been removed from True Names Limited, he wasn’t really gone from the organization as a whole – and in a vote that ended this past weekend, the community confirmed that Millegan will stay on as director of the ENS Foundation and remain a core developer on the project.  That’s because, somewhat confusingly, “ENS” refers to a multi-part organizational structure, as opposed to a single company.  ENS is a program on the Ethereum network, a system for turning long, numerical Ethereum addresses into text-based shortcuts. It functions like a top-level domain on the internet we’re already used to. In the way that the “.com” suffix shortens an otherwise unwieldy IP address into something handy and readable (e.g. “google.com” instead of “142.250.65.238”), the “.eth” suffix gives traders a quick way to identify a specific address on the Ethereum network.  The ENS Foundation is a company incorporated in the Cayman Islands, the legal entity behind ENS. It’s governed by the ENS DAO (decentralized autonomous organization), which is essentially a crypto-backed voting service on the blockchain. It uses a home-brewed cryptocurrency, ENS, to assign proportionate voting power (one token is one vote).  When a DAO member puts forth a proposal, it’s up to other members to use their ENS to either vote for it or against it. There’s also a delegate system, through which token holders can choose a representative to control their votes for them.  ENS distributed ENS tokens to anyone who’d used the service on or before Oct. 31, 2021. To those who didn’t care about participating in DAO votes, it felt like free money, since the tokens are also worth something on decentralized exchanges. (Disclosure, I claimed some ENS tokens last fall and cashed out immediately.)  Because True Names Limited operates as a conventional company and isn’t beholden to a decentralized governance structure, it was able to fire Millegan shortly after the offending tweets were unearthed.  Removing Millegan from the ENS Foundation, however, had to be put to a DAO vote.  That vote was active for the past week days on a crypto voting platform called Snapshot. On Saturday afternoon, it officially failed to pass, with 1.6 million ENS tokens voting “against” Millegan’s removal, and 1.4 million tokens assigned to the “for” position. Around 19% of the total votes cast (698,000 tokens) were abstentions.  While the decision not to remove Millegan from the ENS Foundation seems democratic, it’s important to remember how exactly voting power was initially distributed this past fall. Thanks to the lopsided distribution and delegation of tokens, Millegan has always had outsize power over this ecosystem. This is what distinguishes the DAO governance model from the co-op model, wherein each community member gets one vote no matter their position in the hierarchy.  A quarter of the total ENS supply went to early adopters (everyday users like me, who procured an ENS domain name before November), and 50% went to the DAO treasury, for community members to control via votes. As a way to reward participation in the project (a la equity in a conventional startup), the final 25% went to ENS contributors and developers.  Not coincidentally, Millegan himself holds a massive amount of ENS tokens, and used them to vote against the proposal. He’s also been delegated votes by other ENS holders: He holds around 1,600 tokens in his public wallet, but he’s also controlling the combined voting power of everyone who delegated their votes to him when they claimed their ENS tokens. With some 363,000 votes in his charge, he was able to sway the results in his favor.  Without those votes, the proposal would have passed.  Nick Johnson, part of the team that fired Millegan from True Names, chose to abstain, as did ENS co-founder Alex Van de Sande. Major delegates like Coinbase and Mike Demarais, of the crypto wallet app Rainbow, didn’t vote at all. Why bother campaigning to be a delegate if you’re not going to vote?  It reminded me of a scene in the first season of “Succession,” where board members are voting on whether to remove Logan Roy, CEO of the media conglomerate Waystar Royco, from the company he founded so many years ago. Logan is forced to recuse himself, since he’s the subject of the vote, but he refuses to leave the room, staring down individual board members as they make their choices. Spoiler alert: The vote fails, and Logan fires everyone who voted for his removal.  That is to say, it’s only human to think about changing your vote when you’re under pressure, in the heat of things, or when you know you’re being watched. Even worse, you might decide not to vote at all. Social pressure doesn’t just disappear in the context of a transparent DAO vote.  You can imagine ENS holders and delegates feeling reluctant to vote for fear of being branded a proponent of “cancel culture” on the blockchain (the issue of accountability has only recently become a major issue in the historically libertarian, do-what-you-want environment of crypto).  And you can imagine it going the other way, too, with potential voters afraid to express their support of Millegan in an environment they see as too oppressively “woke.” More than a few influencers have framed Millegan’s firing from True Names as a violation of the right to freedom of religion. (Though, is discrimination a constitutionally protected right?)  In-person voting processes for political races are designed to be private to protect against this sort of thing. The counterargument is that transparent voting is crucial for a delegate system, ensuring that voters act responsibly.  In the case of ENS, the system worked as it was meant to – no one is alleging voter fraud or foul play – and yet the result has enshrined a kind of exclusivity on-chain. The ENS Foundation will continue to be led by a self-professed bigot, according to a simple majority of votes.  What does it mean that one of the most “decentralized” organizations out there, a community with a real system in place for determining its collective future, has chosen this outcome?  Equating DAO votes with monetary value (one vote = one ENS token = around $14) gives the richest community members the biggest say, and the power to tip crucial decisions in their favor. But the lack of standards around recusal may be the bigger culprit here. Because Millegan voted against removing himself from DAO leadership while other ENS leaders chose to abstain, he effectively gave himself the last word.  “If this were web2, a board would remove Brantly immediately simply because ENS itself is at risk,” tweeted the investor David Phelps. “Who would work there now?”  Read More: Of Course It’s OK to Out the BAYC Founders  Now that he’s mostly avoided consequences, the question is whether Millegan will be able to rebuild a fractured ENS – a community that undoubtedly includes gay and trans people, as well as people who simply don’t want to support an organization whose director holds these prejudices.  The crypto industry has a long history of disavowing politics and avoiding conversations related to social justice, but ignoring the potential for discrimination doesn’t make it go away.

That figure accounts for years of sanctions and compliance efforts against Russian bad actors. In other words, it is not specific to the war in Ukraine. Coinbase said it has not seen a surge in illicit activity following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Grewal said.  Exchanges have been under pressure to closely monitor Russian-linked crypto activity in the days following Russia’s attack on Ukraine. Much of that is due to crypto’s purported risk as a tool for sanctions evasion. Coinbase and other industry participants say those fears are overblown.  “Digital assets have properties that naturally deter common approaches to sanctions evasion,” Grewal wrote in the blog post. He later claimed those properties “can actually enhance our ability to detect and deter evasion compared to the traditional financial system.”  Coinbase cast the 25,000 blocks as evidence of its “proactive” work in rooting out bad actors. It said it can anticipate threats, block sanctioned individuals from engaging with the company and detect attempts at evasion.  It's unclear if any of those addresses are controlled by Coinbase or are instead external wallets that it has blacklisted. Coinbase has a very limited business footprint inside Russia, offering only non-custodial services.

During a trial period in February, Santander already delivered loans to Argentine farmers in conjunction with Agrotoken, an Argentina-based agricultural commodities tokenization platform.  ""This is the first time a financial services platform has used blockchain technology and crypto assets to expand the agricultural credit market and unlock farmers’ business potential,"" Fernando Bautista, head of agribusiness at Santander Argentina, said in a statement.  Agrotoken expects that over the next six months, 1,000 Argentine farmers will receive Santander credits collateralized with tokens based on soybeans (SOYA), corn (CORA) and wheat (WHEA) launched by Agrotoken, the company’s co-founder and chief technology officer, Ariel Scaliter, told CoinDesk.  Agrotoken began working with Santander seven months ago, with the project involving both the bank's local team and its global blockchain division.  Santander and Agrotoken plan to offer the crypto-backed loans in Brazil in June, and in the U.S. in late 2022, Scaliter said, noting that the three countries together comprise 70% of global wheat, corn and soybean production.  How it works  According to Agrotoken, each token corresponds to a ton of grain that the farmer has sold and delivered to a grain elevator, which is then validated through a proof of grain reserve test (PoGR).  After a farmer requests a loan from Santander, the bank will confirm on a platform developed in partnership with Agrotoken whether the farmer complies with the conditions to receive the money.  Once the loan is approved, tokens will be sent to an escrow, which is a third-party smart contract, until the credit is repaid with fiat or tokens, Scaliter said. If a farmer repays the loan with tokens, Santander will automatically convert them to Argentine pesos on the Agrotoken platform, Scaliter said.  The SOYA, CORA and WHEA tokens were initially listed in February on Matba Rofex, an Argentinian stock exchange. ""If the tokens were not listed, a bank like Santander would not be able to operate with them,"" Scaliter said.  On March 9, Santander and Agrotoken will officially launch the initiative at Expoagro, Argentina's biggest agribusiness event.

With Tectonic, users can act as lenders or suppliers of liquidity using an algorithmic-based non-custodial money market protocol. Suppliers supply liquidity to earn passive income, while borrowers borrow liquidity in an over-collateralized fashion. Tectonic references Compound, a tried and tested protocol, as part of its protocol design and architecture. With it comes an attractive incentive program powered by the native token for the Tectonic protocol, $TONIC. The tectonic protocol enables cryptocurrency money market implementations securely and seamlessly, allowing users to gain multiple use cases. How Does It Function? Liquidity is provided to borrowers through deposits by users, who may borrow at variable interest rates. According to Tectonic&apos;s smart contracts, these rates are adjusted based on each market&apos;s utilization rate. Is Tectonic a Noteworthy Investment? It is challenging to answer this question. It appears, however, that long-term investment in this cryptocurrency would be a good idea. The graphs for Tectonic will fluctuate in the future depending on the price evolutio...",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ICO | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/is-tectonic-crypto-the-future/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png

42420986,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXAqbN,1646677129,"On Chinese Social Media, Justin Sun Says He Hopes to 'Strengthen Cooperation' With Russia","Justin Sun appears to be hedging his political bets.  In less than a week, the Ukrainian government raised more than $50 million worth of crypto after Russia launched a full-scale invasion on Feb. 23.  Crypto heavyweights were quick to show their support, announcing millions in donations to the cause. Justin Sun, diplomat and founder of the popular blockchain Tron, quickly emerged as a loud voice in the crypto fundraising movement for Ukraine.  But on his Chinese social media platforms he took a somewhat different approach. In addition to writing and publishing posts about fundraising for Ukraine, on March 1 he posted the following message in Chinese to both his Chinese Twitter and Weibo accounts, referencing a virtual meeting with a Russian diplomat:  “In a video call with Russia’s [World Trade Organization] Ambassador Dmitry Lyakishev, we discussed how technology could be used for humanitarian cases for Russia’s development, such as the use of blockchain tech to help citizens that don’t have access to the financial system. Hope to strengthen future cooperation with Russia!”  This message was notably absent from his English language Twitter account, which boasts 3.3 million followers.  A high-profile cryptocurrency figure with a large following in both the U.S. and China, it looks like Sun is walking a political tightrope right now. While the rest of the world has largely condemned Russia’s unprovoked attack on Ukraine, online opinion in China tends to be more sympathetic to Russia, the New York Times reported on Feb. 27.  Sun, a Chinese national who became Grenada’s permanent representative to the WTO last year after stepping away from Tron, said elsewhere on Twitter that his “duty” is to protect Tron users’ interests.  Not only was Sun one of the first to confirm the Ukrainian government was indeed collecting crypto donations – personally reaching out to the Ukrainian government for confirmation – he also announced a sizable personal donation to the cause, all through his verified Twitter account. Through the week, he rallied his Twitter supporters to donate more of Tron’s native token TRX to the cause.  “My guess is simple – it is difficult to write about fundraising for Ukraine in Weibo, given Chinese censorship and predominant pro-Russian narrative,” said Igor Denisov, senior research fellow at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations’ institute for international studies in an email to CoinDesk. (Sun’s Weibo posts on Ukraine fundraising were not, in fact, censored. But other war-related content has been.)  “Brother Sun, help Russia bypass financial regulations and take care,” one Weibo user commented in Chinese on the post about Sun’s meeting with the Russian diplomat. Another said, “[You have] more than $10 billion, that’s enough to [run for president of the United States]”  “This is the right attitude,” said yet another user.  Meanwhile, one of Sun’s posts in support of Ukraine, from Feb. 26, was less well-received by his Chinese followers.  “Brother Sun is pro-NATO?” one user commented, referring to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Russian President Vladimir Putin is against the expansion of this intergovernmental military alliance to eastern Europe. This is cited as a key motivation for Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, which was interesting in joining NATO.  “Ukraine is anti-China,” another user commented, while yet another asked Sun: “Are you a spy sent by the United States?”  A representative from Grenada’s permanent mission to the WTO said during a call with CoinDesk on Friday that Sun’s meeting with the Russian diplomat was simply a courtesy.  “H.E. Mr. Justin Sun paid an introductory courtesy call on his Russian counterpart H.E. Mr. Dimitry Lyakishev on 1 March 2022 via videoconference. Both Ambassadors discussed the latest developments at the WTO. They also discussed potential use-cases of Blockchain technology to help various communities in the world – including in Russia - who might not have access to the traditional finance system,"" the representative said in a written statement later.  Tron “is neutral and decentralized,” Sun tweeted on his main account on March 1, the same day he posted about his meeting with a Russian official.  Stefan Wolff, professor of international security at the University of Birmingham, said Sun’s desire to strengthen cooperation with Russia could be a positive thing at a time when diplomacy has been sidelined.  “I would not rule out that his first and foremost interest is in stability. That requires getting Russia to stop its aggression and it requires that there is a functioning Ukrainian state left once this happens,” Wolff said in an email to CoinDesk.  But it could also just be a matter of image.  “Whether he is sincerely doing the fundraising on other platforms, I honestly do not know. Perhaps it is an attempt to draw attention to himself with a topic that is now in high demand among Western audiences. Perhaps in both cases it is a cynical [public relations] campaign,” Denisov said.  “I am so convinced, he is [f-ing] awesome, a smooth opportunist, doesn’t know what to choose until the last minute,” one Weibo user commented.  Airdrop controversy  On Feb. 26, after Ukraine’s announcement about accepting crypto donations, Sun publicly requested that a Tron address be added to the official list of digital wallets. Less than an hour later, he tweeted he had made a $200,000 donation to the Ukrainian cause in the Tron blockchain’s native token TRX.  On Wednesday, in yet another historic move, the Ukrainian government announced a crypto airdrop (a distribution of tokens) to thank donors who have been sending in millions to the cause.  While Sun was receiving some praise for his meeting with the Russian diplomat on Chinese platforms, he drew heavy criticism from Twitter users from the rest of the world.  In now-deleted tweets, Sun complained that Tron had been excluded from the airdrop. In one tweet that is still live, Sun said the Tron community is continuing to support Ukraine even after being excluded from the airdrop.  “But it is just UNFAIR to exclude them! Every donation should be treated equally!” Sun said.  He was responding to a tweet from crypto entrepreneur Farokh Sarmad that said, “You are screaming about ""unfairness"" while the people of Ukraine are hiding hoping not to get bombed. Please put that into perspective.”  While Sun may have simply been defending the interests of 5,000 or more Tron users that donated to the Ukraine’s cause from unfair treatment, Wolff says Chinese entrepreneurs with a global platform have a part to play in stabilizing a region plagued with uncertainty.  According to Wolff, aside from it being a humanitarian catastrophe that any sensible human being must have an interest in bringing to an end as quickly as possible, what’s unfolding in Ukraine is also hugely disruptive to the global economy.  “So any rational economic actor will also have an interest in ending the war as quickly as possible,” Wolff said.  Wolff pointed to the many major multinationals that have suspended their operations in Russia along with big investors are beginning to divest from the country.  When asked if Sun’s team had any plans to publish the post about strengthening cooperation with Russia on his main Twitter profile, his representative declined to comment on the record.  Meanwhile, Sun has been tweeting about meeting with other ambassadors: On March 1, he tweeted about meeting Jonathan Kaplan, U.S. ambassador to Singapore.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | AIRDROP,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/03/07/on-chinese-social-media-justin-sun-says-he-hopes-to-strengthen-cooperation-with-russia,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

42421656,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXotY5,1646673501,Why Stablecoin Interest Rates Are So Damn High,"Why are interest rates on dollar-pegged stablecoins so much higher than interest rates on actual dollars? You’d think that a stablecoin worth a dollar would command the same interest rate as a dollar, namely zero. But a quick search of lending rates on stablecoins reveals rates of anything from 9% to 13%, or even more.  The easy explanation is that high interest rates compensate people for the risk that the stablecoin will fall off its peg. But prime stablecoins like USDC and Pax (USDP) are fully backed by high-quality dollar assets, so the risk that people will lose their money is small. No, there is another reason – and it highlights a fundamental conflict in the purposes for which stablecoins are used.  Frances Coppola, a CoinDesk columnist, is a freelance writer and speaker on banking, finance and economics. Her book “The Case for People’s Quantitative Easing,” explains how modern money creation and quantitative easing work, and advocates “helicopter money” to help economies out of recession.  We know why interest rates on actual dollars are so low. The Federal Reserve has cut interest rates to zero, so banks have no reason to pay interest on deposits. And the Fed has issued trillions of new dollars, so there are far more cash dollars circulating in conventional markets than anyone has a use for. No one wants dollars so they don’t command any interest.  But the reverse is true for stablecoins. Demand for stablecoins constantly exceeds supply. So people with stablecoins to lend can charge premium interest rates, and crypto platforms desperate for stablecoins offer high interest rates to attract new stablecoin lenders. That’s why stablecoin interest rates are so high. It’s simple economics.  You’d think stablecoin issuers would issue enough coins to satisfy demand. There are, after all, no limits on stablecoin issuance. Stablecoins can be created from thin air at the press of a button. They are the crypto world’s equivalent of quantitative easing (QE), only without the asset purchases. And, indeed, stablecoin issuers have been minting new coins at an extraordinary rate. But Jeremy Allaire printing billions of USDC doesn’t bring down interest rates. The market simply swallows everything he prints and comes back for more. Where is all this demand coming from?  Read more: What's the Point of Stablecoins? Understanding Why They Exist  The most obvious place is exchanges. Stablecoins make great liquidity for crypto exchanges. They enable people to trade in and out of cryptocurrencies easily and quickly without risking losses on the bridging asset. As crypto trading increases, so, too, does demand for stablecoins. A growing exchange such as FTX needs ever-larger quantities of stablecoin liquidity to maintain trading activity. Without these infusions, it would either have to restrict trading in and out of stablecoins or allow stablecoins to fall off their dollar pegs at times of high demand.  Stablecoins also provide crypto investors with a “safe haven” when cryptocurrency price volatility is high. So when cryptocurrencies go on a wild roller-coaster ride, as they have in recent months, demand for stablecoins rises. This tends to push them off their pegs, which rather destroys their purpose. So when people are cashing out of risky crypto into nice, safe stablecoins and USDC is starting to look expensive, Jeremy Allaire cranks up the printing presses.  But although printing more stablecoins keeps them on their pegs when demand is high, it doesn’t bring down interest rates on stablecoin lending. In this respect, stablecoin issuers are not like central banks. Central banks aim to control interest rates. Stablecoin issuers only control exchange rates. When you print money to hold an exchange rate peg, interest rates rise. Jeremy’s printing therefore contributes to the high interest rates on stablecoins.  But it’s not the only reason. There’s an insatiable demand for stablecoins – and it doesn’t come from exchanges. It comes from decentralized finance.  Dollar-pegged stablecoins are used as prime collateral in DeFi lending and staking pools. As more and more people dip their toes into DeFi and more and more new platforms appear, demand for stablecoins as collateral is rising exponentially. In December, research by The Block revealed that stablecoin issuance had risen by 388% in a year, mainly driven by demand from DeFi. If this trend continues, demand for stablecoins as collateral may outstrip use of stablecoins as safe assets on exchanges.  Collateral is by definition illiquid. When you borrow against an asset, that asset becomes “encumbered.” You can’t sell it and you can’t lend it out without your lender’s permission because the lender wants to be able to seize that asset if you default on your loan. So if you pledge USDC in return for DAI stablecoins, you are locking up your stablecoins in MakerDAO’s vaults. They are no longer in circulation. And the same happens if you pledge stablecoins in return for governance tokens on DeFi platforms.  All over the crypto world, there are vaults full of stablecoins. As demand from DeFi grows, more and more stablecoins are being locked up in vaults almost as soon as they are issued. That giant sucking sound you can hear is DeFi draining liquidity to support its massive derivatives pyramid. No wonder Jeremy has to keep printing. If he didn’t, the system would gradually freeze as liquidity becomes scarcer and scarcer and stablecoins less and less like actual dollars.  It is possible to make collateral liquid – if you don’t mind putting other people’s assets at risk. The conventional financial system, which had a similar liquidity-draining derivatives pyramid in the mid-2000s, invented what it thought was a sure-fire way of preventing collateral illiquidity from collapsing the pyramid. It’s called rehypothecation. Instead of locking up pledged assets in vaults, lenders lent them out, over and over again. The double spiral of cash lending and collateral rehypothecation enabled the derivatives pyramid to grow to a dizzying size. But it wasn’t sustainable. It collapsed disastrously in 2008.  Read more: What Is a Stablecoin?  Now those long rehypothecation chains have been regulated away, conventional markets have become reliant on infusions of liquidity from central banks. The Fed has even invented a liquidity pump: It lends dollars to banks in return for pledged securities (the “standing repo facility,” or SRF), and lends securities to non-banks in return for dollars (“overnight reverse repos”, or ON RRP). The idea is to keep control of interest rates. No way is the Fed going to let them fall through the floor or rise to the heights that stablecoin interest rates are reaching.  The crypto world rejects both central bank interference in markets and the regulation that makes it necessary. Unsurprisingly, therefore, crypto lenders are finding ways of making collateral liquid. And whether knowingly or unknowingly, they are reaching for the same tools. Rehypothecation is back. Lending platforms like Celsius use rehypothecation to generate high returns for its depositors: Celsius has been accused of “endlessly rehypothecating” pledged assets, though it denies that it does this.  But at present, rehypothecation in DeFi is small beer. Constant infusions of new stablecoins are the only significant relief for the terrible illiquidity that comes from feeding crypto’s main medium of exchange to the ever-thirsty derivatives monster. And that is why Jeremy Allaire can’t stop printing.",NEUTRAL,USDC,EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | USDC,Frances Coppola,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/03/07/why-stablecoin-interest-rates-are-so-damn-high,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0073d822ee21b6515be52bd44c6991302526b3a8-1936x1549.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394548,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwBXwv,1646672410,An Introduction to Sidechains,"The first concept of a sidechain was published in an academic paper on the Oct. 22, 2014, by Adam Back, the inventor of HashCash and current CEO of Blockstream. Also involved were a host of legendary Bitcoin engineers such as Matt Corallo, Luke Dashjr, Blockstream co-founder Mark Friedenbach and more.  While many of the paper’s authors played instrumental roles in developing Satoshi Nakamoto’s idea of an electronic cash system – namely the integration of HashCash’s proof-of-work consensus mechanism into Bitcoin’s blockchain – they realized there was still room for improvement if Bitcoin was going to service a global audience.  In the sidechain white paper, the authors noted that Bitcoin’s infrastructure, at the time, faced trade-offs between scalability and decentralization. There were also concerns about Bitcoin’s privacy and censorship, with new technologies improving Bitcoin’s cryptographic security deemed necessary if more people were to adopt the bitcoin (BTC) currency.  Read more: What Is Cryptography?  Taking this into consideration, the authors put forward the following:  “We propose a new technology, pegged sidechains, which enables bitcoins and other ledger assets to be transferred between multiple blockchains. This gives users access to new and innovative cryptocurrency systems using the assets they already own.”  What is a sidechain?  A sidechain is a separate blockchain network that connects to another blockchain – called a parent blockchain or mainnet – via a two-way peg.  These secondary blockchains have their own consensus protocols allowing a blockchain network to improve its privacy and security, and minimize the additional trust required to maintain a network.  A key component of sidechains is their ability to facilitate a smoother asset exchange between the mainnet and the secondary blockchain. This means that digital assets such as tokens can be securely transferred between blockchains – allowing projects to expand their ecosystem in a decentralized manner.  In practical terms, an individual using the Bitcoin mainnet needs to send bitcoin to an output address. This address could be a hard wallet, a hot wallet or a sidechain. Once the transaction is confirmed, a notice of the completed transaction is broadcasted across Bitcoin’s network.  Following a brief security check, the sent bitcoin is transferred onto the sidechain, allowing users to freely move their assets across the new network.  Now, as simple as that may sound there are a few key components that allow sidechains to operate effectively. These components include:  A two-way peg  Smart contracts  Two-way peg  Sidechains were developed to facilitate the transfer of digital assets between blockchains, regardless of who is the holder of the assets. Digital assets should be able to be moved without any counterparty risk – meaning that no secondary actor should be able to stop the transfer of the asset from occurring.  To facilitate this transfer back and forth between blockchains, a two-way peg is required. You can think of this as a two-way tunnel with cars driving in both directions.  According to the sidechain white paper, a two-way peg is defined as:  “The mechanism by which coins are transferred between sidechains […] a pegged sidechain is a sidechain whose assets can be imported from and returned to other chains.”  Put plainly, a two-way peg allows digital assets such as bitcoin to be transferred back and forth between the mainnet and the new sidechain. Interestingly, the “transfer” of a digital asset never occurs. The assets are not actually transferred; instead, they are simply locked on the mainnet while the equivalent amount is unlocked in the sidechain.  As a result, any two-pegged operation needs to assume the actors, or “validators,” involved in the two-way pegged are acting honestly. Otherwise, fraudulent transfers could be made, or genuine transfers could be halted.  Smart contracts  To transfer digital assets between a sidechain and its mainnet, an off-chain process – transactions occurring outside of the parent blockchain – that transfers data between the two blockchains must be built.  As mentioned above, because the transfer of digital assets between a parent chain and sidechain are imaginary, digital assets are locked in and released on either end of the two blockchains once the transaction has been validated via a smart contract.  Smart contracts are used to ensure that foul play is minimized by enforcing validators on the mainnet and sidechain to act honestly confirming cross-chain transactions. Once a transaction has occurred, a smart contract will notify the mainnet that an event has happened.  Then, the off-chain process will relay the transaction information to a smart contract on the sidechain, verifying the transaction. After the event has been verified, funds can be released on the sidechain, allowing users to move digital assets across both blockchains.  Note, this process can occur from the mainnet to the sidechain or vice versa.  Bitcoin’s sidechains  Real-life examples of sidechains are Bitcoin’s Liquid Network and RootStock (RSK). Since both sidechains are tied to Bitcoin’s mainnet, only activities involving bitcoin are possible.  The Liquid Network is an open-source sidechain created by Blockstream built on top of Bitcoin’s mainnet. By using the features inherent in sidechains, the Liquid Network’s block discovery time is just one minute, a lot quicker than Bitcoin’s 10-minute block-time. This means 10 times as many blocks can be added to the sidechain versus Bitcoin’s blockchain. The network also allows users to transact digital assets more privately, by masking the amount and asset type being transferred.  Read more: What Is Sharding?  RSK is a sidechain designated to run smart contracts. When using RSK, bitcoin is locked on the Mainnet and is released as smart bitcoin (SBTC), RSK’s native currency.  Due to RSK’s smart contract proficiency, users do not need to convert their bitcoin into other assets to make use of the smart contract. This means they are interoperable on other blockchains networks such as Ethereum.  The potential of sidechains  Sidechains have great potential to expand the scope, scale and dynamics of blockchain technology, allowing previously secluded blockchain networks to become integrated into one common ecosystem.  Taking a macro perspective, imagine a universal blockchain network consisting of numerous blockchains, each with its own consensus mechanism, governance rules and vision yet they all remain independent from one another.  The cross-chain interoperability facilitated by sidechains would allow users to seamlessly navigate across these various projects. This is the fundamental value proposition of sidechains.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Stephan  Roth,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/an-introduction-to-sidechains,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/271ab2b2c7cc275ad02b01fd69073ce951a20087-1999x1499.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421841,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXwSKL,1646672200,What Are Blockchain Bridges and How Do They Work?,"A blockchain bridge is a tool that lets you port assets from one blockchain to another, solving one of the main pain points within blockchains – a lack of interoperability.  Since blockchain assets are often not compatible with one another, bridges create synthetic derivatives that represent an asset from another blockchain.  If you use a bridge to send one Solana coin to an Ethereum wallet, that wallet will receive a token that has been “wrapped” by the bridge – converted to a token based on the target blockchain. In this case, the Ethereum wallet would receive a ""bridge"" version of Solana that has been converted to an ERC-20 token – the generic token standard for fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.  While bridges open up new markets and work toward a brighter multi-chain future, they come with their own security challenges, as proven by a huge $326 million exploit on the nascent Wormhole bridge in February 2022.  Types of blockchain bridges  Some bridges, known as unidirectional or one-way bridges, allow you to port assets only to the target blockchain and not the other way around. For instance, Wrapped Bitcoin allows you to send bitcoin to the Ethereum blockchain – to convert BTC to an ERC-20 stablecoin – but it doesn’t let you send ether to the Bitcoin blockchain.  Other bridges like Wormhole and Multichain are bidirectional, or two-way, meaning you can freely convert assets to and from blockchains. Just as you can send Solana to Ethereum’s blockchain, you can send ether to Solana.  Read more: What is Solana?  Bridges are either custodial (also known as centralized or trusted) or noncustodial (decentralized or trustless). The difference explains who controls the tokens that are used to create the bridged assets. All wrapped bitcoin (WBTC) is held in custody by BitGo, making it a centralized bridge. Conversely, bridged assets on Wormhole are held by the protocol, meaning it is more decentralized.  While hardline advocates of decentralization might venture that the custodial nature of WBTC makes it less secure than decentralized alternatives, bridges that decentralize custody over bridged assets aren't necessarily safer, as shown by the Wormhole bridge exploit.  Why use a blockchain bridge?  Porting assets from one blockchain to another blockchain comes with a myriad of benefits. First, the blockchain onto which you port assets might be cheaper and faster than its native blockchain. This is certainly true for Ethereum, where high transaction fees and slow throughput make it difficult for newcomers to get involved in decentralized finance (DeFi).  If investors ported assets to a layer 2 network – a faster blockchain that sits atop the Ethereum blockchain, like Arbitrum or Polygon – they could trade ERC-20 tokens for a fraction of the cost without sacrificing exposure to Ethereum tokens.  Other investors might use bridges to make the most of markets that exist only on another blockchain. For instance, the DeFi protocol Orca is available only on Solana, but supports a wrapped version of ETH.  Bridges are becoming easier to use. Many DeFi protocols have integrated bridges to let their users swap tokens from different protocols without having to leave the platform. This makes the process of converting tokens through bridges less cumbersome.  What are the biggest blockchain bridges?  According to DeFi Llama, there was $21.8 billion worth of crypto locked in bridges as of March 2022. The largest blockchain bridge is Wrapped Bitcoin, accounting for almost half of the bridge market, with $10.2 billion in total value locked (TVL). DeFi Llama pegs Multichain as the largest cross-chain bridge, with about $7 billion in TVL.  A dashboard on Dune Analytics shows that the Avalanche Bridge is the largest Ethereum bridge, with about $6 billion in TVL, followed by Polygon ($5 billion TVL) and the Fantom Anyswap Bridge ($4.2 billion TVL).  Are blockchain bridges safe?  Like with all of crypto, your capital is at risk. Some novel decentralized bridges are relatively untested and even those that have been tested are subject to exploits. The most notable recent example is Wormhole, but a week before that attack, a bridge called Qubit was exploited for $80 million.  Read More: How to Stay Safe in DeFi  According to analysis from blockchain analytic firm Elliptic, the Wormhole attack occurred because Wormhole allowed the attacker to mint 120,000 worth of wrapped ethereum without having to stake any ETH. The attacker then withdrew the free WETH. A high-frequency trading firm called Jump Trading covered the losses to bail out the protocol.  Trusted bridges have different risk profiles. Instead of the risk that an attacker exploits the protocol and drains it of funds, the risk is that the company that holds staked assets is corrupt or negligent or loses control over the assets because of incompetence or because of orders from a third party, such as if a government requests that the company freeze assets.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | SOL,Robert Stevens,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/what-are-blockchain-bridges-and-how-do-they-work,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/35c890a3eb196399067bebc1bee5015109eb1d7d-1440x959.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42395898,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASzmmR,1646671810,Ukraine Is Buying Bulletproof Vests and Night-Vision Goggles Using Crypto,"Some of Ukraine’s weapons suppliers are accepting payments directly in crypto, a senior official told CoinDesk Monday.  Ukraine “weaponized” crypto after Russia invaded the European nation at the end of February, raising over $60 million in bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and other cryptocurrencies and immediately spending some of these funds on fuel, food and other supplies – including bulletproof vests for soldiers.  Ukraine’s de facto crypto ministry, the Ministry of Digital Transformation, is facilitating the buying of military equipment based on the demands of the Ministry of Defense, said Alex Bornyakov, the deputy minister at the ministry. The operation involves Kuna, the Ukrainian exchange that set up the donation addresses; two ministries; five signatories and several other government officials as key players.  Bornyakov is the deputy to Mykhailo Fedorov, the Minister of Digital Transformation and vice prime minister. He told CoinDesk he was not in the nation’s capitol of Kyiv but did not specify further.  Spending crypto  At least three of five authorized signatories have to approve any expenditure of Ukraine’s crypto funds. The process has been put in place in order to avoid a situation in which signatories are stuck in bunkers or incommunicado.  “Most of the people are in Ukraine. And it is a terrible situation right now. The war zone is in different parts of Ukraine. It is possible that people could be in a shelter or they can lose connection for days and so we have to have a redundancy plan just in case someone can’t be in touch,” Bornyakov said. The ministry is working with Ukraine’s Kuna exchange in a public-private partnership as the exchange already had an infrastructure in place to receive the funds or transact on behalf of the government.  What also helps Ukraine is some of its vendors are willing to accept crypto payments directly.  “Some of the military suppliers have accounts in crypto. Actually, some of them have companies and bank accounts in jurisdictions where cryptos are allowed. And they can just get crypto in ethereum, bitcoin and, of course, in some stablecoins,” Bornyakov said.  For Bornyakov, crypto has been a more flexible and cheaper tool than bank transfers.  “It is easier, not complicated, transparent, and faster in comparison to a SWIFT transaction, which could take more than a day,” he said.  3 of 5 signatories  Ukraine operates a multisignature wallet to control the donated cryptocurrencies, Bornyakov said.  “I cannot say who controls the multi-sig wallet since it is a security matter,” he said. “We moved to a safe location because it is impossible. A couple of times a day there are airstrikes, sirens, so we have to go in the shelter, the bombings, it’s complicated,” Bornyakov said.  Officials within Ukraine’s Ministry of Defense decide how the crypto donations are to be spent, though Bornyakov declined to name any specific individuals involved in the process.  “It’s not just one person who decides. Three people have to sign out of the five authorized signatories, and so who makes the decision doesn’t really matter,” Bornyakov said.  Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has emerged as a rallying figure for the country, does not seem to be involved in these purchases.  “We don’t speak to him directly. There is a big structure and there are people who are taking that decision. I don’t know. They are more like a black box to me. I know people who were appointed and who said you have to deal with this guy,” Bornyakov said, refusing to say who “the guy” was.  Ukraine has not revealed a complete list of where the crypto donations are being spent for “security purposes” but Bornyakov has promised to do so in the future.  “Right now we can’t just put a list of what we bought because the enemy is watching,” Bornyakov said.  Bornyakov said that the crypto fund is being used to purchase non-lethal equipment for military purposes such as bulletproof vests, night vision goggles, military-grade food rations and medical equipment that helps with hemostasis such as tourniquets.  Ukraine’s crypto fund has received $60 million, while Ukraine’s national bank has received $280 million to 300 million in fiat currency donations from private parties.  Lobbying the world  Even as Ukraine raises millions in crypto to fight Russia, it has lobbied crypto exchanges to prevent anyone in the aggressor nation from accessing the same services.  Ukraine’s government has asked eight different exchanges to freeze Russian accounts. So far, only some have responded directly, Bornyakov said, though he did not identify these exchanges.  “In general all of them have said they have to be compliant with the sanctions list. But it’s a private business. It’s up to them to stay in Russia or leave Russia, but what everybody agrees on is that if there is a sanction from Europe or Ukraine to specific people then they will block them,” he said.  According to Bornyakov, these exchanges have already blocked accounts of a “couple of thousand people and their relatives who were sanctioned by the U.S or those connected with the Russian government.”  Some exchanges appear to be blocking Russian accounts, but have not responded to the Ukrainian government directly, he said.  “So if you work with Russia even for crypto you basically support the killing of innocent [civilian] people and that’s unacceptable, and if you stand for human values then you have to pull out of Russia,” Bornyakov said.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | FIAT,Amitoj Singh,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/03/07/ukraine-is-buying-bulletproof-vests-and-night-vision-goggles-using-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fc68c2d1c1d34922504fdd3d096940deded69f5f-4256x2832.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Some have pointed out the regulation blueprint resembles the official advice of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) – an intergovernmental organization founded by the G7 group of nations to combat money laundering and terrorism financing – a little bit too closely.  “Is the FATF supposed to have such a strong influence on how European policy is shaped?"" asked Thomas Spaas, a Belgian attorney specializing in crypto regulation. “With such legislation, crypto exchanges will have to do even more of what they were already doing anyway: keeping records of their customers. This means yet more paperwork for crypto companies and another obstacle for new entrepreneurs to overcome.”  The regulation was introduced independently of FATF.  Kanko and Urtasun propose to drop the threshold for crypto transactions, which would effectively force exchanges and wallet providers to record the ""travel information"" for every single transfer. European authorities would obtain the name of the sender and the recipient, the sender's home address, passport number and the wallet address of both the sender and recipient.  Kanko and Urtasun argue in their draft that small transactions with cryptocurrencies are often used to fund terrorism or launder money. Such a loophole would enable the use of digital assets to fund and hide criminal activities, since illicit capital can anonymously move without any geographical limitations with a good chance of remaining undetected, the MEPs explain. This would justify the need to remove the 1,000 euro threshold for crypto transactions.  The blueprint also mentions the curation of a white list for crypto exchanges that successfully implemented satisfactory KYC procedures for users. They could possibly be exempted from having to record every single transaction. Kanko specifically mentioned Binance as a crypto exchange that could possibly acquire a spot on the white list.  Uneven playing field  The regulation draft sparked debate within the European crypto industry. Key players in Europe are often receptive to and relaxed about regulations being drafted in Brussels. However, the hefty expansion of the ""travel rule"" has business owners worried about the possible risk of stifling the competitiveness of the region.  “A complete implementation of the ‘travel rule’ will prove to be difficult, considering not every technology allows this particular information to be stored and transferred. It would be much easier to set up a global register of identified addresses, a procedure also used in banking,” said Marc Toledo, managing director of Belgian crypto exchange Bit4You and director of the Blockchain Association of Belgium.  According to Toledo, the EU shouldn’t identify crypto as an enemy in their fight to combat financial crime.  “The enemy is and will always be anonymity and badly implemented KYC procedures. Regulators will have to coordinate closely with crypto exchanges to pinpoint solutions that increase security without hindering the future and competitiveness of the European crypto industry,"" he said.  Olivier van Duijn, CEO of the Dutch crypto exchange LiteBit, also pointed to possible risks of weakening Europe’s crypto industry.  “It’s always great to take further measures against money laundering and terrorist financing, but it is unfortunate that a ‘traditional’ approach to managing risks in a new sector is being adopted. This policy will be implemented in certain countries or regions sooner than within others. That could create an uneven playing field,"" van Duijn said.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | BNB,Jeremy Van der Haegen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/03/07/european-parliament-proposes-expanding-travel-rule-to-every-single-crypto-transaction,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4aabf9a29692cfbc52d3f9610b2c8dfacf7cc84f-2400x1597.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The process is expected to take about 18-24 months, and would expand the company’s mining capacity to 12 exahash per second (EH/s), or an annualized bitcoin (BTC) production capacity of about 19,600. This would make BitNile one of the top 10 publicly traded North American miners, said the company.  BitNile already has about 2,160 Bitmain S19j Pro Antminers at work at the data center, has 300 more in transit and has purchase agreements for another 18,140, with monthly deliveries to begin in December.  The accompanying power expansion is part of the company’s multi-year agreement with a nuclear energy plant. BitNile expects about 85% of power will come via emission-free sources.  “The planned expansion of the power capacity at the Facility to 300MW over the next 18 to 24 months would, if achieved, enable BitNile to grow its existing partnership with Bitmain while potentially attracting other strategic joint-venture partners,” said the company’s founder and executive chairman, Milton Ault, III.

42420992,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXAqfV,1646665739,"‘How Can Information Be Free but Expensive?’: Holly Herndon on Web 3, Art and the Future of IP","February’s ETHDenver convention was a celebration of a very specific strain of crypto-culture.  Just as much floorspace was devoted to an augmented reality sculpture garden as to sponsor tables. Just as much stage time was given to discussion of public goods funding as cryptography. Ethereum is correctly seen as a culture of weirdos and do-gooders, and ETHDenver was a showcase for the weirdest and do-goodiest of them all.  Read more: How Ethereum Will Be Transformed in 2022  Few represent that nexus better than Holly Herndon, Mat Dryhurst and Dan Keller. The three traveled to ETHDenver from their shared home base in Berlin, which rarely gets credit for its thriving community at the intersection of crypto, art and politics. Herndon may be best known as a musician – I’ve been a fan since 2015’s “Platform,” an elegant but unnerving slice of drum-and-bass and vocal manipulations released on the legendary 4AD label.  Dryhurst, Herndon’s partner, is both a multimedia artist, a music industry veteran and a lecturer on music at New York University’s Berlin campus. Herndon and Dryhurst co-host “Interdependence,” a podcast about technology and culture. Keller is a longtime fine artist and co-founder of New Models, an online art and philosophy community.  Their creative accomplishments aren’t the main reason I sat down to interview the trio, though. They have also worked for decades pushing forward the technology and business side of creativity, with a particular focus on building infrastructure to support independent artists. Now, they see blockchain and Web 3, particularly DAO-like communities and NFT-gated content, as one of the most promising avenues for indie artists. And they were way, way ahead of the curve: One of the best tracks on “Platform,” an album that’s now seven years old, is titled simply “DAO.”  Read more: What Is a DAO?  Keller is helping develop a non-fungible token-based content platform called Channel. Looking even further ahead, Herndon and Dryhurst are working to develop systems to track the provenance of remixed intellectual property using blockchains. We discussed where they see Web 3 taking culture, why weirdos thrive in a Web 3 world, and what makes Berlin so cool. Their ideas are exciting, radical – and best of all, optimistic.  This interview has been edited for length and clarity.  CoinDesk: I’d love to start by just talking about what you’ve done in crypto and blockchain, and what you find promising about the technology.  Holly Herndon: We all have multiple projects spinning at any one time. I’m working on something called Holly Plus, though it’s not out yet. We see machine learning models getting really sophisticated over the next few years. So you’ll be able to make models of my speaking voice, my singing voice, my physical likeness.  Holly Plus is a proof of concept for that. We started out with a rough model of my voice [as a filter] and made it free for anyone to use in any way that they want. They don’t have to ask permission. But a cohort of people made submissions of their creations to our NFT gallery, and we’re auctioning those off to raise funds to do the next season. The idea is eventually to release a naturalistic version of the voice.  Essentially, we’re interested in this concept of IP, not as intellectual property, but as identity play. I think there will be a place where people will want to perform through one another. Fans will want to perform through the bands and musicians that they follow.  And there are interesting ways to do that, to have things registered on-chain and find a way for some of that money to flow back to the creators themselves and the people who are providing the models … You can have approved versions, and say, “I sanction this one.” But if someone wants to do something gnarly with the [Holly Plus] voice and I don’t approve, you can see that I haven’t approved that.  We’re taking a bet that NFTs have changed the way that people deal with IP. This idea that the more something spreads, the more valuable it is – that’s a very different paradigm from Web 2.0. Like with NounsDAO – to open up the IP, even to pay people to create derivative work, makes the original work more valuable.  Read more: Web 3 Is a Return to the Internet’s Wild Spirit  The narrative in the technology press is focused on the risk around deepfakes and simulation. Can you talk about why you find it interesting artistically to have yourself copied and not approach it with this anxiety of imitation?  Holly: I’m a computer musician first and foremost, and I started using my voice as a way to make the laptop a more embodied performance. I didn’t see myself as a singer – I was like, what if I use my voice as a data input, as a control? What can I do with my voice to make it live in this electronic landscape that I’m creating?  So you had a less precious relationship with your voice from the start.  Holly: I mean it’s still precious, I love it. But my idea of what’s natural or what isn’t may be slightly different. I became obsessed with vocal processing. I was thinking, what are the physical limits of my voice, and how can I use technology to go beyond those physical limitations? I can use freeze functions to never have to breathe. I can use transposers to hit registers I never could physically.  For me, a machine learning model of my voice is an extension of that. That model never has to breathe. It has perfect pitch. It can sing in Hindi with a perfect accent. I can’t do that. So for me, it’s still my one-of-one voice. But I’ve always seen technology as something that lets me do something beyond my immediate physical limitations.  Mat Dryhurst: And beyond that, you know, we’ve devoted ourselves to this. Holly wrote her dissertation on intellectual property and machine learning voice models. So [blockchain] wasn’t a matter of fitting a square peg in a round hole. It just happens that establishing provenance, letting people permissionlessly interact with media but have some protections there for the artist – these tools are really useful, genuinely useful for this “deepfake problem.” It’s like, no, this is kind of an opportunity.  That lines up with a really notable thing about ETHDenver this year: The actual applications for this technology are starting to come into focus.  Mat: Totally. We’re quite close to the grind: In crypto, we know the developers working on these protocols. In the machine learning space, we’re very close to machine learning engineers. So when we’re making decisions about this stuff, we can tell you with some certainty, this is coming now. Because we’ve seen the research-level stuff, and it’s coming.  I don’t know when it’s happening, but it’s happening, and everyone’s going to have to deal with it. So why not approach it as an opportunity? We know that people will probably really enjoy using [this technology], because it’s really remarkable. So how do you make it not suck?  Holly: Because it could go in a direction that would really suck for the creators, and we’re trying to mitigate that.  Mat: We came up with the term “spawning” as opposed to sampling. You can sample a David Bowie line and you can pitch it up or you can pitch it down. That’s not the same thing as you being able to sing anything you want as David Bowie.  Holly: It’s like, if a sample is dead, a spawn is a reanimated corpse or something.  Mat: A sample is like “Weekend at Bernie’s” – you can position it to look alive. But spawns have a life of their own. We premiered tech at Sonar last year where I sang as Holly, and it’s very convincing. In five years it will be incredibly convincing.  Holly: I want to go to karaoke and I want to sing as Beyoncé. And I want to be able to do a Beyoncé-Michael Jackson hybrid. Or a duet. It’s just going to get weird.  Mat: And as fun as it is going to be, there will also be business opportunities there. The amazing thing about crypto, which we tried to figure out for a long time, is how can you make something free for everyone to use, but also have value exchanged?  Holly: How can information be free, but also expensive?  Read more: Snoop Dogg's NFT Mixtape Invites Remixes. Does It Authorize Them?  We have a shared background in punk culture, experimental noise music, and DIY art and performance spaces. And now we’re part of this extremely weird tech that is becoming suddenly mainstream. What’s the connection between fringe culture and this (until recently) fringe technology?  Mat: We talk about this a lot. From maybe 2014 to 2016, in scenes we were familiar with, there were factions that were splitting off to think about cultural infrastructure. And that happened to dovetail really heavily with the conversation that was happening in Ethereum.  I think Vitalik [Buterin, creator of the Ethereum blockchain] spoke in New York in 2015 or so, and for people in our scene, Ethereum became a discussion point. That’s when we started making art with DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) in mind. What if you could have transnational co-ops that everyone had ownership in? It became a very progressive set of ideas.  And since then, people like Jesse Walden, who comes from a music management background, he’s a big crypto VC now. The Friends with Benefits founding crew are almost exclusively from music subcultures. Trevor [McFredries] used to DJ [including for Katy Perry – ed.]. Alex Zhang at FWB comes from a strange DIY space background.  When I look at the mainstage here at ETHDenver, it’s about half people who are really deep in Ethereum, and there’s a significant share of people coming to prominence from this [art] community. People who were our friends from art circles, are up on the main stage discussing governance and DAOs, and thinking about public goods.  Holly: And they started thinking about governance outside of crypto, in artist’s collectives, at monasteries in Italy.  Dan Keller: This is the first year or two where I feel like wordcels and shape rotators can actually work together. If we were at this conference a couple of years ago, we would be talking about transactions per second, and we’re actually at a point where people are actually building stuff with it. It’s very exciting.  You’re all based in Berlin, along with a lot of other people at that intersection of art and blockchain. What is it about Berlin that creates that crossover?  Holly: I think every city has its own crypto scene and vibe, and the Berlin vibe is definitely the art and crypto intersection. Thoughtful crypto, you might call it. I think one of the backgrounds is Germany’s really big focus on privacy. Cryptography, in its original sense, is a really big thing there. (Edward) Snowden is a hero. You have a lot of privacy journalists, activists. And so a lot of the interest we had was coming from that direction.  Dan: Before crypto was a thing, Berlin was a center of the post-internet art scene. So there were just a lot of people thinking about these things.  Mat: Also, a lot of people don’t know that the Ethereum genesis block was published in Kreutzberg (a district in Berlin). Berlin should know that – the city of Berlin should really do more. “Web 3” was coined in Berlin by Gavin Wood (one of Ethereum’s founders). Gnosis was founded in Berlin by Martin Koppelmann. There was a phenomenon in 2017 of crypto raves, the first one was in Berlin.  As people who are on both sides, doing the creative thing and engaged in the technology and business of art, how do you balance those?  Holly: Those things have always been intertwined. There’s this idealized 20th-century myth of the artist somehow being removed from the economy. And either they were wealthy enough to pay people to be these intermediaries, or they just weren’t highlighting that side of the story. That’s how you’re a self-sustaining, successful artist. You figure out the business side as well.  The difference with crypto is that it’s all very public, so the, I don’t know, romance around a lot of that stuff is gone. It’s a bit more honest. I think that’s jarring for people to see how much money someone is making, the money flow, but I think that has always been part of the story.  Mat: I can only speak for us, but it comes from a very progressive place, having an interest in this – giving people agency over the networks they use. Given it’s decentralized, you can’t take responsibility for decisions other people [working in crypto] are making. I don’t personally care about 95% of music, and it’s kind of the same with this.  Tell me about Channel.  Dan: We think of it as Web 3 Patreon for squads, by squads. Three communities – “Interdependence,” New Models and Joshua Citarella at [art publisher] Do Not Research – we all squadded up and created a single NFT that provides token-enabled access across all three.  That’s the minimum viable product, but the goal is to build a new institution. We thought there should be new systems where we’re not competing with our peers for the same audience. We’re going to build features for ourselves that we need for our own communities, generalize those into a product and eventually build it into a hyper-structured permissionless protocol. That’s the goal.  Holly: If you think about the Web 2 paradigm, it’s like, everyone can be a creator, everyone can do anything. And a lot of interesting stuff came out of that. But everyone became this individual little company that was competing with everyone else. We’re really interested in crewing up, creating channels, creating a la carte magazines.  On the consumer side, you don’t have 20 subscriptions you’re dealing with, it’s all in this one channel. And on the creator side, you can really crew up and support each other, collaborate on editorial and not cover the same stuff.  Mat: The reason we called the podcast “Interdependence” is that was the observation going back to our involvement in independent music. I worked in sort of “late” independent music infrastructure [as a staffer for London label Southern in the early 2000s], the last record labels that had the warehouses and sold directly to customers.  And Web 2 absorbed a lot of the independence narrative and all of the romance of independence culture that I associated with a previous time. It was all kind of reduced down to this idea of individuated actors outside of any institution, outside of a label. This was the promise of Spotify – you don’t need anyone anymore. That’s cool, but what we find out over time is that things collect at the top. The very top, who generally tend to be pretty in bed with older institutions.  Absolutely. It’s blockbuster-driven, it’s lowest-common-denominator driven. I guess one thing we’re discovering is that when there’s no friction, everything tends to concentrate toward one point. When there’s a little bit of friction – you have to make a choice, make a commitment, spend some money, get involved – then you get a lot more diversity, it feels like.  Mat: Totally. And that’s the opportunity now – experimenting with re-valuing culture in some way. We release records on 4AD, a very venerated independent institution. And you need those institutions, you need them to represent that. Otherwise, it’s cool that everyone can go on TikTok and try to make a jingle, but …  You need some curation. I’ve had to write so often about this deluge of PFP (profile picture) NFTs, you know, that’s not art. That’s not how art works. There’s a system, and it’s there for a reason. It’s not just about elitism.  Dan: And calling it art or not isn’t a value judgment, it’s just a comment about what system it’s participating in. Thinking about the social mechanism is interesting, even if it’s not visually interesting to me.  I mean, I intend it as a value judgment. My wife’s a painter near the beginning of her career, and she’s seen other people her age who sort of blew up very quickly. And in each case, I had to go, no, that’s a commercial artist. That’s different than what you’re doing, and the timescales are different.  Mat: And even for these things to be debated, I’m really concerned about canon disappearing, about discourse disappearing. You need that debate. Well-funded writers debating whether a PFP is art. In our career spans, that has eroded significantly in the music world and in the art world. And it has ended up relenting to more populist dynamics where it’s just, okay, let’s just be a commentary on the fashion system, or the influencer network, just slowly relenting to poptimism.  The point being, all these institutions need funding, all these middle entities. It’s become quite common in crypto to parrot the same kind of liberatory promises of a Web 2, where you’re borrowing again from the romance of the independence economy. It’s like, no, no, no. The opportunity here is to rebuild lots of different competing institutions. I don’t want there to be just one, and I don’t want everyone to be atomized. But we need these scenes and factions to be established again, and that’s absolutely happening.  Holly: I think that’s also why people are skeptical of the [crypto] space. We’ve had this massive techlash in the last two years. Everyone saw how Web 2 started out, with all this liberatory language. And then all the value kind of accumulated at the top, and I think people have been burned by that. It’s like, here we go again. You’re going to save me again.  There’s two sides to that though – there’s the liberatory language that gets used for Super Bowl commercials. But in practice it’s very exclusionary in a way that I think is not necessarily bad. I love to see all the people here at the conference, but I’m sure some of them just had their minds blown and others are just so intimidated that they’re not going to come back.  Holly: I don’t want people to be excluded for financial reasons, and that’s a real problem. There are technical barriers, and we do need more tools for on-boarding. But I do like when people have to spend time with a subject in order to be part of a community. We come from deep scenes, where you don’t just show up and say, “I know everything and I have an opinion on everything.” You learn who the scene elders are, you learn what conversations have happened, and you get up to speed.  And that’s what’s been so shocking about this whole NFT thing. So many of the criticisms that have come out, it’s like, that conversation happened three years ago. Check it out, we’ve been there.  Mat: To me, anything interesting that happens culturally, that’s how it spreads. I vividly remember going to shows and someone being like, ‘You need to get into the Dillinger Escape Plan’ or whatever. And I went to the shows for six months and I didn’t enjoy it. And then eventually I’m like, “I get this now.”  It’s no different going to a weird Web 3 conference, and you’re like, “I don’t know what a smart contract is.” Stuff’s hard. You could make the analogy with participating in a Discord – you see people dedicating immense amounts of time to these communities. Dan refers to it as “The Dark Forest.” There is this other layer of culture that exists now on Discords and the like.  Dan: Well, there’s no masterworks being created there, but it’s an incubator for an interesting new culture that you do not see on the surface.  It’s hard to quantify, but I think a lot of people would agree that the last 10-15 years have been, culturally, a desert. There’s just something missing. And you seem to feel like the main culprit is the collapse of institutions caused by Web 2.  Mat: I feel stalked by the 20th century. We’re very lucky, we get to go to fancy art things, and I go and I feel like I’m 19, because I’ve seen it all before. Sometimes I feel like I’m going insane. It’s the same modernist, weird…  Holly: The same romance over and over again.  Mat: There’s no shortage of interesting things that are being incubated, but we’ve lost all the funding structures. Web 3 is one potential avenue. I would love for some other avenues to appear miraculously out of nowhere. But I’m not holding my breath for, like, state support of experimental art. That’s why we have to be close to the development of the infrastructure, it’s our responsibility.  There was a period in the 20th century where a lot of things were aligned, where there was an economy around writing, art, culture. People were surprised and in awe of a new cultural thing every three years, like clockwork. We’ve lost that.  There’s this very famous studio in Berlin, and we couldn’t afford to record there, but we booked a photo shoot. And I told the guy, “I’m so embarrassed we can’t afford to actually record here.” And he said, “Nobody can afford to record here. We’re booked for photo shoots five days a week.”  Because we live in this zombie cultural existence now, this hangover of the 20th century. We still live under those auspices, but professionals know that it’s barren. There’s no cavalry coming, you know what I mean?  So it’s, like, I have some critiques about Web 3, but this techlash stuff … John Chowning and the people who invented commercial synthesis [leading to mass-market electronic keyboards and drum machines], basically democratized music making, democratized art making, they were techno-optimists too. Do we retroactively take the techlash to them? All of this s**t came from interesting cultural moments when funding was apportioned to new, dynamic cultural ideas. Where’s that happening? Web 3. I don’t see that happening anywhere else. And I lament that. I wish there was more.  Holly: Those are my cultural heroes, people like John Chowning. So when you ask, what’s the connection between experimental art and crypto, I’m running toward, for better or for worse, what is the most interesting new thing that creates genuinely new interactions or art making capability?  That’s what I find exciting.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,David Z.

As of press time the largest cryptocurrency by market value was changing hands just above $39,000, after dipping below $38,000 earlier in the session.  Brent crude jumped as high as $139 a barrel on Monday, a 14-year high – not too far away from the record $147 reached in 2008.  Europe’s Stoxx 600 and Asia Dow dropped more than 3%, while U.S. S&P 500 futures traded 1.4% lower. In India, the rupee lost 1.1% to trade at a record 76.98 per dollar. Germany’s benchmark DAX Index lost 4% on Monday, entering the dreaded “bear market” territory – a term for when assets lose more than 20% of their value over two months.  The fear in traditional markets is that soaring oil prices might put more upward pressure on inflation, already running at its fastest in four decades, adding to economic challenges that include Russia's invasion of Ukraine and supply-chain bottlenecks.  During Asia morning hours, losses on most major cryptocurrencies ranged from 5% to over 8% before bitcoin’s run caused a slight recovery. Binance’s BNB, Terra’s LUNA and XRP regained losses to trade flat in the past 24 hours, while Solana’s SOL and Cardano’s ADA lost over 3%.  The crypto fear and greed index – which tracks market sentiment – reached readings of 23, implying a state of “extreme fear” in the market. Such values are a sign that investors are too worried and the market could see a recovery, compared to readings above 60 while signal greed in the market and the chance of a due correction.  Some analysts say the crypto market’s correlation to broader traditional finance has weakened its narrative as an inflation hedge. On the other hand, bitcoin has reacted negatively to the Federal Reserve's efforts to tamp down the upward pressure on consumer prices.  “Cryptocurrencies do not remain aloof from politics, and they are weakly confirming the role of an alternative to the banking system now,” shared Alex Kuptsikevich, financial analyst at FxPro, in an email to CoinDesk. “With a sharp decline over the weekend, bitcoin wiped out the initial gains, gave away the positions to bears after the third straight week of gains.”  Others say a global recession could materialize if the Fed pushes forward aggressively to boost interest rates.  “Many predict a global recession is on the horizon if the Federal Reserve decides to hike rates aggressively starting from March 16,” wrote Marcus Sotiriou, an analyst at the crypto broker GlobalBlock, in an email.  Sotiriou, however, is among traders who remain bullish on the long-term promise of cryptocurrencies.  “I think that the introduction of regulatory clarity in the U.S., even if it hinders innovation at first, will ignite the next wave of money to enter the crypto markets,” Sotiriou stated. “This is how a $100,000-$500,000 price for bitcoin is achievable over the next five years.”",NEGATIVE,ADA | BTC,ADA | BTC | COMMODITY | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/03/07/bitcoin-creeps-toward-40k-as-surging-oil-prices-create-bear-market-worry,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/58c49ddf1f88b8cdd3a7473cff5e97e4ff81bb79-733x553.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421669,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXotgL,1646663400,It’s Complicated: The Relationship Between Crypto and NFTs,"If the last 12 months in cryptocurrency has taught us anything, it's that people really like owning a piece of code that proves they overpaid for a JPEG file. And it's not just about monkey pictures either. Soon NFTs (non-fungible tokens) will be used to trade music rights, real estate and debt instruments.  NFTs have a strange relationship with cryptocurrencies. It’s similar to that of a parent and child. When the NFT market was small, it depended on the crypto markets for its price action, but as they have matured, they have been breaking away.  When the cryptocurrency market did its best impression of a downhill ski slope in January, NFTs were booming, with NFT trading platform OpenSea recording $5 billion in sales volume, an all-time high. Some crypto observers thought that meant there was a reverse correlation between crypto and NFT markets: When bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market goes up, NFTs go down, and vice versa.  Others have pointed out times when both markets have moved in sync as was the case recently when NFTs sank along with the rest of the market when the war in Ukraine began.  Some correlation found  Professional research on NFTs is thin, because just a couple of years ago, most of the market didn’t exist. One study that looked into the subject is titled “Is Non-Fungible Token Pricing Driven by Cryptocurrencies?” by Dublin City University professor Michael Dowling.  “Anyone active in the NFT market will be aware of the strong crossover between cryptocurrency market participants and NFT market participants,” the paper states.  That is partly because to buy an NFT you need to use cryptocurrencies as a means of payment, a nontrivial level of complexity for many people.  Crypto exchange Coinbase, however, plans to make participation easier. Its much anticipated NFT marketplace will allow users to buy NFTs with fiat using their credit cards. Indeed, companies like eBay, Reddit and Instagram all have plans to integrate NFTs, also likely using fiat options that may cause NFTs to further decouple from crypto. But until that happens, the connection between the two markets remains pertinent, and besides, NFTs will always need a blockchain like Ethereum and Solana to function.  “Immediately apparent from the results is that, compared to cryptocurrencies, there is much lower spillover from and to NFT markets,” Dowling's paper says. “Further, even among the NFT markets there is quite limited spillover, suggesting these markets are quite distinct from each other.”  A study last June by Blockchain Research Lab agrees with Dowling. “A drop in cryptocurrency value means lower purchasing power, which is likely to depress the NFT market,” the study says. “Conversely, when cryptocurrencies appreciate, investors tend to look for new or alternative investment opportunities. This is especially plausible in the context of ETH, the standard denomination of NFTs.”  Both papers, however, were released in the first half of 2021 before the NFT market took off. Data from this year suggests that there might not be much correlation between the two after all.  An independent market?  A Coin Metrics report from February looked at the correlation between the price of Ether (ETH) and the sales volume of OpenSea to see if rising ETH price caused a drop in NFT sales. “Looking at the data there does not appear to be a consistent correlation between OpenSea sales volume and ETH price,” the report says. “It appears that NFTs are a relatively independent market and may, for the most part, move separately from the rest of the crypto market.”  DappRadar also concluded that NFTs respond differently to macro factors than the rest of the crypto markets. “The undeniable role that NFTs play in both the metaverse and the play-to-earn narratives has primarily contributed to positive on-chain metrics despite unfavorable macro indicators,” a DappRadar report from January says.  Some prominent traders, however, still see patterns between NFTs and crypto markets. They argue that when the prices of bitcoin and altcoins decline, money moves into NFTs. That could be because traders are looking for somewhere to take profits or to chase more gains or because trading JPEGs is a fun diversion during times of market turmoil.  Using data on OpenSea’s daily sales volume from Dune Analytics, we can identify two so-called “NFT bull runs.” The first started in late July and picked up steam in August before declining in September. A second major NFT uptrend began in mid-November and peaked on Feb. 1.  While NFT volume started to increase in July when BTC's price was in the doldrums, both crypto and NFTs posted gains In August. bitcoin gained 76% that month before declining in September along with NFTs. So the only clear case of inverse correlation has been November-February when NFT volume boomed while BTC and altcoins declined.  A muddled situation  It’s interesting that those most likely to argue for patterns and correlations are traders whose job it is to see patterns and act with conviction. On the other hand, analysts and academics are less cocksure in their conclusions. “I don’t believe crypto markets are so easily related,” said Lennart Ante, co-founder of Blockchain Research Lab. “If bitcoin drops 10%, no one wants NFTs; people would rather move to stablecoins.”  What’s clearer is that when NFTs were in their infancy – before March 2021 – there was a spillover effect from the larger cryptocurrency markets. But since the late 2021 boom, the NFT market has behaved differently.  Maybe it’s just a bubble that has been big enough to elevate the NFT market even as the rest of crypto is floundering. Or maybe we are seeing a maturing NFT market decouple from crypto and go its own way. “The January NFT boom was mostly driven by social media hype and fear of missing out,” Ante said. “The boom could still have a way to go and you never know how big something can get.”  NFTs seem to be moving away from the cryptocurrency markets that birthed them but are also not fully independent. They are behaving like teenagers: experimental, rebellious and keen to go in their own direction.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Nathan Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/03/07/its-complicated-the-relationship-between-crypto-and-nfts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7d6858329c6c21f1ae738ed368df406b3b0fc5a5-612x409.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Hive said an original design manufacturer (ODM) will incorporate the Intel (INTC) chips into an air-cooled bitcoin mining system. The system is expected to be delivered over a period of 12 months starting in the second half of 2022.  “Intel’s energy-efficient and high performance blockchain accelerator is expected to reduce our power consumption over current ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) miners on the market,” Hive President and Chief Operating Officer Aydin Kilic said in a statement.  Intel revealed the details of the first generation of its mining chip, which failed to match current rivals, at a semiconductor conference in February. However, it is the second generation that will be shipped to Hive as well as to peers Griid, Argo Blockchain and Block (formerly Square) later this year.  Last month, Griid said Intel’s second-generation mining machine, Bonanza Miner 2, will be the second most efficient on the market with a hashrate of 135 terahash/second (TH/s) at an electricity efficiency of 26 joules/terahash (J/TH).  Vancouver, British Columbia-based Hive also signed a deal with Compute North to deploy 100 megawatts of miners at a Texas facility that is run by renewable energy.

The funds will be used toward global expansion, including boosting Immutable Gaming Studio and merger-and-acquisitions activity.  Other participants in the round included Mirae Asset, ParaFi Capital, Declaration Partners and Tencent Holdings, among others.  Immutable last raised money at a $410 million valuation in September, the company told Reuters, which was the first to report on the latest funding round. Last fall, Immutable raised $60 million in a Series B funding round.

Sign up here to get it in your inbox each weekday morning.  Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market Moves: Macro factors continue to weigh over bitcoin. Weekly chart offers hope to battered bulls.  Featured stories: Professional investors see bitcoin as an inflation hedge, a hedge fund survey shows.  And check out the CoinDesk TV show “First Mover,” hosted by Christine Lee, Emily Parker and Lawrence Lewitinn at 9:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern time. Today’s show will feature guests:  Ben McMillan, chief investment officer, IDX Digital Assets  Lisa Mayer, founder and CEO, Boss Beauties  Arthur Falls, team member, cycle_dao  Market Moves  By Omkar Godbole  Legacy risk assets saw yet another sell-off early Monday as surging crude prices threatened to push the global economy into stagflation.  Gold responded by rallying above $2,000 per ounce for the first time since August 2020. However, bitcoin, often touted as digital gold, fell under $38,000 early Monday.  While the cryptocurrency has since bounced back to $38,700 alongside a recovery in the S&P 500 futures, prices remain well below last week's highs above $45,000.  ""The pullback [from past week's high] is being driven by macroeconomic issues,"" Quinn Thompson, head of growth at blockchain-powered institutional capital marketplace Maple Finance, told CoinDesk in a Twitter chat. ""Global commodity prices are going to all-time highs (part supply chain issues, part fiat debasement) and are weighing heavily on consumers.""  ""With previous economic slowdowns occurring in a low inflation environment, central banks are facing a new problem this go around and may not be able to add additional monetary stimulus as support,"" he added.  While money markets have scaled back expectations for rate hikes by the Federal Reserve in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine war, the central bank is still seen raising rates at least five times this year. The first 25 basis point rate hike is likely to happen next week.  In other words, the Fed put – a notion that the central bank will come to the rescue if assets tumble – appears to have expired. That said, emerging economies and European countries, which are likely to take a bigger hit from the Russia-Ukraine war, may keep their policy accommodative, lending support to bitcoin and asset prices, in general.  ""I suspect growth projections for 2022 around the world will need to be sharply revised lower, and it will be interesting to see what the central banks of the world will do. I believe Europe and Asia will halt thoughts of monetary policy normalization, and with Europe on the front lines, I can't blame them,"" Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst, Asia Pacific, Oanda, said in an email.  Bitcoin rose more than 14% to nearly $45,000 on Feb. 28, decoupling from the lingering weakness in stock markets to register its biggest single-day percentage gain in over a year. The rally was supposedly driven by expectations that Russians and Ukrainians would pour money into crypto to hedge against the heightened volatility in their fiat currencies.  ""Last week's relief rally stemmed from the idea that Russia (and others) could potentially be large buyers of BTC as an alternative reserve asset after the world was able to unanimously disconnect a country from the global monetary system almost overnight,"" Maple Finance's Thompson said.  While the cryptocurrency has reversed the past week's spike, it has been relatively more resilient than traditional markets since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 25, according to Coinbase. ""Bitcoin's $34,400 support level was tested twice on February 25 and rallied both times, indicating strong buy interest around that price,"" Coinbase's February review published last week said.  Several reasons, including expectations of fewer Fed rate hikes, appear to have cushioned bitcoin from continued sell-off in stocks, the exchange noted.  According to technical charts, the cryptocurrency may be close to turning the corner.  On the weekly price chart, bitcoin formed an inverted hammer candle at the Ichimoku cloud support last week.  The candlestick pattern is identified by a long upper wick and a small body. The appearance of the candle after a prolonged bear run or at major lows often portends a bullish reversal.

Hedge fund Nickel Digital Asset Management's latest survey of institutional investors and wealth managers, who collectively manage around $110 billion in assets, shows that most heavyweight market participants see the leading cryptocurrency as a store of value asset.  ""Three in four professional investors (73%) believe that because there are a finite number of bitcoins, the cryptocurrency is a viable asset to hedge against rising inflation,"" the survey's press release shared with CoinDesk said.  Further, 78% of the respondents said bitcoin's unique supply-side dynamics would bring more institutional allocation to bitcoin.  Bitcoin's supply has a hard limit of 21 million coins, and the pace of supply expansion is cut by 50% every four years via a programmed code called mining reward halving. That puts the cryptocurrency's monetary policy in stark contrast to traditional central banks, which have been expanding the fiat money supply for decades.  The institutionalization of bitcoin seen since the March 2020 crash has proved to be a double-edged sword. While on the one hand, it has legitimized crypto as an asset class, on the other, it has led to a stronger correlation with riskier assets.  The digital asset tends to move in tandem with high beta stocks, as Piper Sandler's Michael Kantrowitz tweeted.  According to Nickel Digital Asset Management, bitcoin's correlation to risky investments will eventually weaken and the cryptocurrency's inflation hedging narrative will become dominant.  ""Investors should not view bitcoin as a safe haven asset at the current early stage of its adoption curve. Bitcoin clearly behaves as a risk-on asset and will remain such until wider institutional adoption takes place,"" Anatoly Crachilov, CEO and founding partner of Nickel Digital, said. ""However, this does not undermine bitcoin's ability to provide a long-term hedge against inflation term thanks to its immutable, finite supply and credible neutrality, i.e., independence from any single country's monetary policy.""  Investors could continue to look at alternative assets like bitcoin for inflation-beating returns in the long run. The real or inflation-adjusted returns on traditional fixed-income investments are likely to remain negative despite rate hikes, as elevated inflation is expected to rise further in the coming months. Together, Russia and Ukraine reportedly account for about a quarter of the global trade of staple goods.  The U.S. 10-year real yield has declined to -0.93% – a 50 basis point collapse in two weeks, according to data provided by Reuters. That's perhaps powering gold higher at the moment.  Some observers are hopeful that a continued move higher in the yellow metal would eventually put a bid under bitcoin. Note that gold led the cryptocurrency higher in 2020. The yellow metal rose to fresh record highs in August 2020, and four months later, bitcoin followed suit.  ""The higher gold goes, the more likely BTC starts getting that correlation going again,"" Split Capital's Zaheer Ebtikar tweeted. ""But buying gold is actually the worst.""",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,"Omkar Godbole, Bradley Keoun",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/03/07/first-mover-americas-investors-see-bitcoin-as-inflation-hedge-nickel-digitals-survey-shows,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a5343e09fd81f37c89cec748ef8ce369e782b7f9-720x406.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Everyone&apos;s Focused on Crypto Instead of Banks: Changpeng Zhao In the latest tweet posted today, the CEO of Binance, Changpeng Zhao pointed out that there are about 350 Russian banks and only about a dozen or so are on the sanctions lists. In comparison, there is only a minuscule portion of crypto firms but the entire focus has been put on the nascent asset class. His comments come from the fact that the media and politicians have repeatedly highlighted in recent times that cryptocurrencies are used to evade sanctions. In a blog published last weekend on Russian sanctions and crypto, Changpeng Zhao had said that even if crypto helped Russia evade sanctions, it had a negligible presence. He clarified in the recent post that banks, which hold 99.7% of the money, the media and politicians are instead focusing on only 0.3% of the money. He concluded his note by saying that instead of focusing on bitcoin, it may be far more effective to focus on banks, oil/gas, or other means.The post 350 Banks in Russia But Everyone&apos;s Focused on Crypto: Changpeng Zhao appeared first on Cryptoknowmics-Crypto News and Media Platform.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | BNB,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/350-banks-in-russia-but-everyones-focused-on-crypto-changpeng-zhao/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png

Griffin Gaming was founded in 2019 by Sanderson, Tuosto and Peter Levin, with LionTree – a boutique merger-and-acquisition firm where Tuosto serves as managing director – as a strategic partner to Griffin, which has more than $1 billion in assets under management.

FTM dropped 8% in the past 24 hours to as low as $1.32 in early Asian trading hours, more than 60% below its lifetime high of $3.46 in October.  Foundation CEO Michael Kong addressed investor concerns in a tweet earlier today as prices fell. “The Fantom ecosystem consists of hundreds of developers building many great applications. They will continue,” he said. “Anton (Nell), who works with Andre, tweeted that they were 'terminating' 25 projects. This was misunderstood. They are 'terminating' their involvement, but handing over anything they run to the existing teams.”  Multichain and Solidex, among the largest Fantom projects by total value locked, will continue to operate with their existing team of developers, Kong confirmed. “These projects are not closing down development. Some of them have been running independently for years,” he said.  FTM gained 10 cents in the hours following Kong’s tweets. Meanwhile, the price volatility caused just under $6 million in losses to FTM-tracked futures, data shows.  Cultish following  Cronje was one of the many developers who built products based on Fantom and Ethereum, garnering a cult following. He was the key architect behind successful projects like Yearn Finance and Keep3r Network on Ethereum, and he also served as an adviser to the Fantom Foundation until last month.  Tokens of Ethereum-based Yearn, one of Cronje's first projects, boasted a market capitalization of over $3 billion at their lifetime peak, trading as high as $90,700 from lows of $31 in 2020, data show. In the past 24 hours, YFI dropped as much as 25% before recovering.  Yearn’s success fueled a ""Cronje Effect"" in crypto circles. In the past years, projects built by or associated with the developer have garnered millions of dollars within hours of their launch.  The frenzy included unfinished projects like Eminence, which attracted $15 million from investors even before a full rollout. It was ultimately exploited for the full $15 million before hackers returned $8 million to Eminence’s deployer address.  Meanwhile, Yearn developers suggested the YFI market had overreacted to the announcement as Cronje hasn't been involved in recent months.  “You do realize Andre hasn’t worked on it for over a year?,” tweeted pseudonymous Yearn developer Banteg. “And even if he did, there are 50 full-time people and 140 part-time contributors to back things up.”  YFI seems to have stabilized near $18,100 at the time of writing after falling from $19,500 on Sunday.",NEUTRAL,FTM | YFI,BUSINESS | FTM | MARKET | TRADING | YFI,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/03/07/fantom-ftms-loss-eases-as-foundation-soothes-investor-concerns,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9a165b605041ce4513f0bae8eaab8d4fd22b8771-2238x1428.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Tokens of the Fantom ecosystem dropped as much as 33% in the past 24 hours after influential developer Andre Cronje called it quits on developing decentralized finance (DeFi) projects, a multibillion-dollar crypto sector that relies on smart contracts instead of third parties to provide financial services like trading, lending and borrowing  Investors initially started to react as Cronje – who had served as an adviser to the Fantom Foundation since mid-2018 – updated his LinkedIn bio to reflect the end of his tenure at the foundation last month.  Business partner Anton Nell then confirmed the exit in a tweet.  “Andre and I have decided that we are closing the chapter of contributing to the defi/crypto space,” Nell wrote. “There are around ~25 apps and services that we are terminating on 03 April 2022.”  FTM lost 30 cents in the following hour as the tweet went viral. Reactions were mixed, with some supporting the move and others seeing it as suspicious. FTM fell as much as 18% in the past 24 hours, dropping to a weekly low of $1.32 in early Asian hours before slightly recovering to $1.42 at the time of writing.  The drop contributed to an exodus of the total value locked (TVL) in Fantom-based DeFi protocols, which have slumped 20% in the past 24 hours. TVL on decentralized exchange SpookySwap and lending platform Scream dropped over 21%, while recently released Solidly – which Cronje was part of – lost 42% in TVL, data from DeFi Llama show.  Fantom ecosystem tokens plunged with the drop in FTM prices even though there's no apparent connection between their related projects and Cronje. In the past 24 hours, SpookySwap’s BOO tokens lost 16%, SpiritSwap’s SPIRIT fell 21%, and Scream’s SCREAM tumbled 30%.  Solidly’s SOLID tokens took the biggest hit, with prices dropping to as low as $0.80 on Sunday before recovering to $1.29. The price is now down 92% from highs of $15 in February, data show.  Overall, Fantom ecosystem projects lost $1.5 billion in market capitalization, data from analytics tool CoinGecko show.  Meanwhile, some investors said Cronje’s exit won't mean the end of the projects he worked on because the underlying smart contracts continue to exist.  “While Cronje’s departure from crypto and DeFi is undoubtedly a great loss, the developer has helped build the projects in a way that will allow them to function without him,” Dmitry Mishunin, founder of a DeFi analytics company HashEx, wrote in a Telegram message to CoinDesk.  “Since they are deployed as immutable smart contracts, there is no way to shut them down, so as long as there is a community to run them, the projects will survive,” Mishunin said.",NEGATIVE,FTM,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FTM | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/03/07/fantom-ecosystem-coins-defi-value-locked-plunge-after-developer-exit,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/60132411b327a4c9ce2b1833bccca5d556dd3f22-1900x1268.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Past Performance of SAND SAND prices continue to trend lower under the highly influential bearish trendline, and the selling observed in the entire crypto market. The downtrend breaks the 200-day EMA and the psychological support of $3. Hence, the downtrend may shortly reach the $2.65 mark. Source-Tradingview SAND Technical Analysis SAND prices fell by almost 20% last week after facing rejection from the confluence of 50 and 100-day EMAs. Hence, the altcoin may find support at the previous lower price rejection spot at $2.65. However, a tighter bearish grip over trend control will result in a downfall to $2.30. The 50 and 100-day EMAs maintain a negative trend after the bearish crossover. Hence, with the negative direction, the 50-day EMA might shortly result in a death cross. RSI Indicator: The RSI slope continues a negative trend after failing to rise above the 50% mark.

42423713,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2ecxh,1646643726,Whale Holdings in Cardano's ADA Token Hit Record High,"Large investors, known as whales, appear to be bargain-hunting Cardano's ADA token as the programmable blockchain's decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols see rapid growth.  The balance held by addresses with 1 million to 10 million coins rose to a record 12 billion ADA ($9.72 billion) last week, a 41% gain since late January, data provided by blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock show.  The total value locked in the Cardano network has increased by $50 million in a week, hitting a lifetime high of $160.79 million, according to DefiLlama. More than 70% of the funds are locked in decentralized exchange (DEX) SundaeSwap.  ""Cardano appears to be showing signs of promise for more to come after years without launching smart contracts. This appears to be translating into an accumulation of ADA from large players,"" Lucas Outumuro, head of research at IntoTheBlock, said in a weekly report published on Friday.  ""After years of lacking smart contract capabilities, Cardano is starting to show some traction in its application layer,"" Outmuro noted. ""DEXs on Cardano have raised capital from reputable crypto funds such as Three Arrows Capital.""  Last week, Cardano-based DEX AdaSwap announced a $2.6 million fund raise led by venture capital firm iAngels and several other investors, including actor and producer Gal Gadot and her husband Jaron Varsano.  Whale holdings have increased by over 40% this year. ""Following a 70% correction, these addresses have now been accumulating aggressively. This group, as well as those holding over 100M ADA, recorded double-digit growth month over month,"" Outumuro said.  The renewed interest by large investors may be a sign of good times ahead, assuming the broader market finds a footing. Whale selling in early September turned out to be an advance indicator of a price slide. ""These [whale] addresses had previously sold a large amount of their holdings right before ADA began to crash,"" Outmuro noted.  ADA peaked above $3 on Sept. 2 and has lost more than 70% since then. The ninth-largest cryptocurrency by market value was last trading near $0.8080, a 5% drop on a 24-hour basis.",POSITIVE,ADA,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/03/07/whale-holdings-in-cardanos-ada-token-hit-record-high,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/665f5e9296cd1430bf54c6881a9ac87993f674ca-1920x1440.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Top Losers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Cosmos ATOM −9.3% Smart Contract Platform Solana SOL −5.2% Smart Contract Platform Internet Computer ICP −4.8% Computing  Cryptos Has a Lost Weekend  Bitcoin began falling late Friday and continued to drop through the early part of the weekend before coming to a temporary rest at about $39,000. At the time of publication, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was trading below $38,500. Ether and major altcoins were in the red on Sunday.  Bitcoin's decline began as bad news throughout last week quashed even the faintest hopes of a resolution to the Russian onslaught and erased gains from earlier in the week when investors saw Ukraine and Russia's separate use of crypto as proof of its potential.  ""The drop on Friday was a reversion to prices that shot up when people believed there might be more of an escape to crypto in the wake of fiat banks and payment gateways in Russia and Ukraine restricting access,"" Joe DiPasquale, CEO of fund manager BitBull Capital, wrote in a text to CoinDesk. ""The price would be buoyed if there were a de-escalation with the Russia/Ukraine conflict.""  That seemed unlikely on Sunday as Russia continued its brutal attacks against Ukraine with Russian President Vladimir Putin rejecting all overtures for a ceasefire, even to a targeted truce that would allow citizens of Mariupol, a besieged port of roughly 500,000 people, to flee. Russia has been targeting Mariupol and other Black Sea ports to isolate Ukraine's southern coast with its access to shipping and industry.  Russian forces pounded other major Ukraine cities with artillery and rocket fire, according to multiple reports. In one instance, mortar fired killed a mother and two children as they evacuated the town of Irpin near the capital of Kyiv. European and North American media outlets reporting on the invasion even found themselves under attack on at least one occasion.  Meanwhile, the three largest credit card companies, American Express, Visa and Mastercard announced over the weekend that they would be suspending operations in Russia. The decision added to a flurry of sanctions by countries aligned against Russia in hopes of crippling its economy. Already there are signs that the sanctions are biting hard as the ruble's value against the dollar has plummeted to less than a penny.  At the time of publication, Bitcoin was down about 2.5% over the past 24 hours and over 7% from early Friday when the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was still trading at roughly 41,600. Ether was changing hands at about $2,550 on Sunday, off over 4% from a day ago.  DiPasquale believes that bitcoin could hit ""its next resistance just below $36,000 before bouncing back up to $40,000,"" and noted that ""many, long-term investors"" may see this as ""a buying opportunity."" But he added that that ""new investors are skittish given global uncertainty, as well as uncertainty"" about the Biden Administration's executive order on crypto in the near future.  Markets  S&P 500: 4,328 -0.7%  DJIA: 33,614 -0.5%  Nasdaq: 13,313 -1.5%  Gold: $1,970 +1.7%  Insights  Singapore's Lightbulb Capital Considers E,S and G Equally Important  ESG is a divisive issue in crypto.  Many in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector associate the acronym with the first letter: E, for environmental (the rest is Social and Governance). And with this comes conceptions of militant greenism, with all its criticisms of blockchain technology for “melting the earth.”  Elon Musk’s concerns over bitcoin’s ESG credentials helped cause a crypto crash last May, and crypto developers and entrepreneurs term receives a certain degree of hostility in the industry.  But wait a minute, argues Lightbulb Capital’s Daniel Liebau. Lightbulb Capital is working with Singapore-based Modular to bring some reform to DeFi using a term familiar to TradFi investors. Lightbulb is acting as an advisor, while Modular is the investor.  Liebau wants the world to know that the S and the G are separate sometimes overlooked criteria in ESG – and we need to focus on all three aspects equally.  For Modular, the S in ESG may stand for social but it also wants to use the S to emphasize sustainability. It’s not just about the carbon footprint (important because Modular prefers less energy-intensive proof-of-stake projects) but rather about the project’s long-term potential.  “It’s interesting to see how people or projects drop in and out of the top 10 on CoinMarketCap over time,” Liebau told CoinDesk. “We want to eventually be invested those platforms that stay for a very long time because other people can build on them and create peer-to-peer commerce type of applications.”  Liebau argues that platforms focusing on things like financial inclusion rather than, say, lottery apps are the sustainable ones.  The other way Modular uses S is for social. When analyzing an investment opportunity the firm looks for the projects following on social media platforms. Why? Liebau points out there’s plenty of research that correlates between social following and platform adoption.  “You can tell that there are some platforms that are perhaps technically brilliant. … They tick all the boxes from an economics, technology and design perspective, but they haven't managed to attract a community, which can then drive the adoption,” Liebau said.  And what about G for governance? It seems that every major DeFi scandal involves problems with governance. The DeFi project Wonderland had quite the scandal recently when it turned out that ""Sifu,"" a core member of the founding team, was actually Michael Patryn, the co-founder of failed Canadian crypto exchange QuadrigaCX and a serial scammer with a criminal record.  In the TradFi world, to get close to managing money Patryn would have to do a FINRA background check, which would likely reveal his sordid past.  “That's why we spend a whole lot of time to think about how is governance organized,” Liebau said. “What we basically bet on is that good governance eventually will be priced in, but then, obviously, it's too late to get in.”  Sometimes this means that a “benevolent dictator” at a project isn’t a bad thing, because that means progress can be made even if decentralization is slowed down.  “Decentralization is non-binary. It's not like you are decentralized or you're not decentralized. Especially if you're trying to create a new platform, then that needs to have a roadmap towards decentralization attached to it,” Liebau said. “When you try to decentralize everything on day zero, it's not manageable.”  The question is, however, whether bold attempts at corporate governance coming from Singapore – where many of these projects have their real-world entities registered – make much of a difference?  A16z’s approach to DeFi governance, centered around distributing governance tokens to outside groups to decentralize the project, went sideways when it turned out that some of these decentralized groups had financial interests in the project itself.  In theory, this approach to ESG melds well with the thesis that DeFi needs to embrace the best practices of traditional finance to attract that next institutional dollar. After all, that next dollar raised will likely come from an ESG fund.  It will only make a difference if DeFi, as a whole, feels it’s ready for this. After all, this is an industry that still has issues with revealing true names and prefers to operate with pseudonyms.  Pseudonyms wouldn’t necessarily exclude a project from Liebau’s vision of ESG.  “I think I'd be more comfortable if you could uniquely identify who they are. Do they need to be KYC? I think the future will tell,” he said, referring to know-you-customer rules. “That's something that we're not so certain about at this moment.”  After all, a pseudonym is how Michael Patryn became Wonderland’s 0xSifu.  Technician's take  Bitcoin Extends Pullback Toward $37K-$40K Support Zone  Bitcoin (BTC) was unable to catch a bid after overbought conditions appeared on the charts earlier this week. The pullback generated a loss of upside momentum, although lower support around $37,000-$40,000 could stabilize the down move.  Resistance at $46,700 remains intact, which capped a series of price rallies since the Jan. 24 low at $32,930. That could signal an extended period of consolidation, especially as trading volume continues to fade.  Still, there is potential for higher volatility this month. Bitcoin has been capped within the $30,000-$69,000 price range over the past year – a wide trading zone with sharp price swings.  The previous trading range from May to October 2020 resulted in a strong rally. This time, however, monthly momentum gauges are at an all-time low, which lowers the chance of a significant upside move in March and April.  For now, market conditions are tradable (small position sizes and tight stop losses) from a short-term perspective. And over the long term, the 40-week moving average, which is currently neutral/flat, has been a useful guide for trend direction.
