42434132,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP8Vdh,1617836749,Mysterious Filings Suggest Impostor Is Using Grayscale's Name to Pump Obscure Coins,"Someone appears to have gone to odd lengths to impersonate digital asset manager Grayscale Investments, possibly in an effort to drive up the prices of two lesser-known cryptocurrencies.      To be clear: Grayscale said it has no intention of creating a financial instrument around nahmii, an Ethereum scaling project, or theta, a video platform. Nevertheless, there is a pair of registered trusts, one for each obscure coin, in the state of Delaware (the trust for nahmii misspells the coin’s name with one “i”). Each of these trusts bears Grayscale’s name, and the registration gives the same agent's address that the firm uses for its real crypto investment vehicles.      ""Grayscale maintains a list of assets that we may potentially include in our family of products, and any further additions will be announced,” an external spokesperson said by email. “Anyone seeking to confirm an asset Grayscale is considering should refer to this list.” Neither nahmii nor theta is on it.      When asked point-blank if Grayscale had filed the “nahmi” or theta trusts, the spokesperson, Austin Downey, said: “No.”      CoinDesk mistakenly reported on Tuesday that Grayscale, a subsidiary of CoinDesk parent firm Digital Currency Group, had filed to register the trust for the nahmii token, based on public records from the Delaware Division of Corporations. This would have been a significant development had it been true because these registrations are usually a prelude to creating an investment vehicle for a coin.    Grayscale’s trusts attract significant capital from mainstream investors who can’t or don’t want to go through the hassle of setting up a crypto wallet. All told, the firm manages $27.7 billion in assets through nine active trustshttps://grayscale.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Grayscale-One-Pager-February-2021.pdf. So a Grayscale registration would be a bullish signal for a coin.    But Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein promptly tweeted that the nahmii story was “inaccurate,” and CoinDesk corrected the story.      Still, even though Grayscale said it did not file the registration with the Division of Corporations for nahmii, or a similar one for theta, someone did; the public records can easily be found online in the state agency’s databases.      The Nahmii team tweeted that it was “not in discussions with Greyscale about filing a trust.”      An email to the address listed on Nahmii’s website received a bounceback message. After the publication of this article, representatives from the Theta project told CoinDesk they were not involved in filing the trust registration.      ""We are very upset to see now that someone else may have done this,"" Theta Head of Strategy Wes Levitt said. ""We are talking to our counsel ... to see if there is a way to learn who exactly filed this, and what other legal actions are available to us against this person filing what we now consider a fraud.""      A customer service representative with the Delaware Division of Corporations said the Division would not be able to share any identifying information about who filed the trusts. So for now, the filings’ origins remain a mystery (no phone number or person’s name is in the documents).    Dead ringers    If the two trusts in question were set up by impostors, it wouldn’t be the first such ruse in crypto, though this one would be subtler than usual.      Scammers often impersonate influential community figures on Twitter and have pretended to be CoinDesk staff members and spoofed our email newsletters, all in order to trick people into sending them money.      The dubious Grayscale Nahmi Trust (here on out, GNT) and Grayscale Theta Trust (GTT) filings were very similar to those of the genuine Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and Grayscale Litecoin Trust (GLTC). For example, they are all registered at 251 Little Falls Drive in Wilmington, Del. (ZIP code 19808).      The key difference was in the type of entity set up. While GBTC and GLTC were registered as Statutory Trusts, GNT and GTT were registered as Limited Liability Companies, a detail which “raises questions,” said Sarah Brennan, a corporate and securities attorney at Harter, Secrest and Emery.      Indeed, of the 34 “Grayscale” trusts registered with the Delaware Division of Corporations, only two were registered as LLCs. These are the entities that Grayscale said it did not set up.      Eight of the registered statutory trusts match existing Grayscale products: BTC, BCH, ETH, ETC, ZEN, LTC, XLM and ZCH. A ninth, its XRP Trust, was dissolved earlier this year as a result of a Securities and Exchange Commission suit against Ripple alleging its sales of the cryptocurrency violate federal securities law.      Another 23 of the registered statutory trusts are on a list of assets that Grayscale is “currently considering,” according to a February post on Medium.      The remaining two: Theta, filed in February, and Nahmi (again, sans the coin’s second “i”), filed in April.    ‘Classic crypto’    It’s conceivable these apparently fake entities were set up in hopes the news media would discover and report their existence, with the ultimate goal of pumping the prices of these tokens.      This sort of move was almost inevitable, said Brennan, who called it “classic crypto marketing.”      She pointed to a January CoinDesk article about possible future trusts (the article precedes Grayscale’s Medium post), saying these trust filings easily lead to speculation around whether certain assets might become part of a new investment vehicle.      If pumping nahmii was the motive, the plan worked: According to CoinGecko, NII’s price more than doubled on Tuesday after the erroneous CoinDesk article was published, hitting a peak of $0.0148. As of press time, it traded at half that price, around $0.0075. It’s still up dramatically over the past month, however.      Theta has also risen in price over the past few months, though there doesn’t appear to be any correlation between the filing of the fake Grayscale trust and the token’s price.      It is difficult to determine the ownership of an entity formed in Delaware, Brennan said.      While there are a few limits on what entities can be formed – for example, Delaware might not allow a new entity to be created that has a “confusingly similar” name to an existing company or product – pretty much anyone can set up an entity in the state, said Brennan, who also leads the digital asset practice at Harter.      “You can form basically any entity that isn’t taken,” she said. In “Delaware and the other states, their concern is ‘does this entity exist in my state?' only. If not, ‘yes you can pay me to set this entity up.’”      Companies can try to prevent this by reserving names for a period of time or registering an entity without having it immediately up and running, she said.      CoinDesk has filed a Freedom of Information Act request for the certificates of formation for these Nahmi and Theta LLCs, and had not received a response as of press time. According to the Delaware state website, the government has 15 days to respond.

House bill 133, which the governor signed Monday, lets sportsbooks accept “digital, crypto and virtual currencies” bets in lieu of greenbacks – so long as those cryptos can be converted to cash.      The law’s crypto rider highlights how lawmakers in America’s least-populous state are embracing digital currency as an essential part of their legislative agenda. First came the bills to woo crypto business. Now, Wyoming legislators told CoinDesk, crypto inclusion is almost second nature.      “I think that Wyoming legislators are getting more comfortable with cryptocurrency as the issue evolves in our state,” said state Sen.

The new law will allow gamblers to fund their accounts in cryptocurrency, according to state Rep. Tom Walters, (R-Casper), another sponsor. He said it will apply only when “operators” – legalese for sportsbooks – are willing to accept cryptocurrency.

The trading volume has been around or below $3 billion for seven days now.      The oldest cryptocurrency is looking at a price support level around $54,000, as CoinDesk reported earlier, with resistance around $60,000.

After having logged three days of gains, ether saw a price pullback Wednesday, slipping below $2,000 for the first time since April 3.      Other alternative cryptocurrencies (“altcoins”) also suffered losses, according to CoinDesk 20.      Analysts at the cryptocurrency data firm Messari have highlighted the so-called “Coinbase effect” where new digital tokens such as cardano tend to receive a quick price pump after they become available on the U.S. crypto exchange giant Coinbase.

42434121,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP8Rdh,1617826502,Bloomberg Foresees Bitcoin Rallying to $400K This Year,"How high can bitcoin fly in the ongoing bull run? That's a question on traders’ minds after the cryptocurrency’s price jumped fivefold since October.      According to Bloomberg bitcoin (BTC) analysts, the price could climb as high as $400,000 this year, from about $56,000 now. The uber-bullish prediction is based on bitcoin's performance during the 2017 and 2013 bull runs.      ""Our graphic depicts bitcoin on similar ground as the roughly 55x gain in 2013 and 15x in 2017,"" Bloomberg Crypto noted in a monthly report published this week. ""To reach price extremes akin to those years in 2021, the crypto would approach $400,000, based on the regression since the 2011 high.""      While past performance is no guarantee of future results, history might rhyme. The latest bull run comes in the wake of last May’s reward halving on the Bitcoin blockchain – an automatic, every-four-years, 50% reduction in the pace of new issuance of units of the cryptocurrency.      Bitcoin chalked up staggering gains in the 12 to 18 months following the previous reward halvings in November 2012 and July 2016.      ""The year after a supply cut (halving) is what 2021 has in common with 2017 and 2013, along with subdued volatility,"" the Bloomberg bitcoin analysts wrote, adding that the December 2017 peak represented a 50-fold rise from the average price observed in October 2015, when the 180-day volatility reached lifetime lows.      The long-term volatility gauge almost revisited the record low in September 2020, analysts noted. Bitcoin averaged roughly $11,000 that month.    Risk-off asset and digital gold    Some observers fear a faster rise in bond yields could dilute the appeal of inflation hedges such as gold and bitcoin, pushing their prices lower.      However, Bloomberg analysts foresee bitcoin remaining relatively resilient in a rising yield environment.      ""Rising real yields are a headwind for gold prices, but less so for bitcoin, still in its price-discovery stage,"" analysts noted. ""Gold is fighting a battle with bitcoin, which can earn 6%-8% in crypto savings accounts and is well on its way to becoming a global reserve asset in a digital world.""      The cryptocurrency fell by 20% in the last week of February after the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield rose to then-12-month highs above 1.5%. The yield has continued to rise since then and recently reached a 14-month high of 1.77%. The bitcoin market, meanwhile, has held firm.      According to the report, the steep discount witnessed recently in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), a popular investment vehicle, is the result of increased expectations that the U.S. will eventually approve a bitcoin exchange-traded fund. GBTC is still holding its 50-day average support, which has enticed buyers in the past.

42434119,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP8Rbh,1617825399,Here's How the Archegos Debacle May Have Spilled Over to Bitcoin,"There is a small ripple effect from the multibillion-dollar Archegos Capital fallout to the crypto world, which is reflected on the bitcoin futures premium on CME. But the crypto market is largely unaffected.      The latest crisis on Wall Street involves a rapid de-risking triggered by the trading crisis at Archegos Capital, a family office managing at least $10 billion that bet $50 billion-$80 billion on leverage that led to nearly $5 billion of losses for Switzerland’s Credit Suisse and the departure this week of its investment-banking chief.      Listen: Corruption, Leverage and Cheap Money: Archegos and the Fastest Loss of Wealth in History      Chicago-based CME, which offers traditional finance players bitcoin exposure with its popular futures contract, may have been slightly affected, as seen in its CME futures premium, or the price reflected in futures contracts minus the current spot price. That premium has lagged behind the equivalent gauge at popular retail-focused exchanges including Binance, Deribit, FTX and OKEx.      According to a top crypto-industry investor, the discrepancy might reflect the Wall Street deleveraging.      “We are seeing everywhere de-leveraging in the traditional financial space,” Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at the digital-asset investment firm Arca Funds, told CoinDesk in a phone interview. “The CME mostly serves your typical big hedge funds, big mutual funds, and the leverage is less than it was because of this leverage crackdown from the prime brokers and from the exchanges” in traditional markets.      On the CME, the annualized bitcoin futures premium rate, the gap between bitcoin’s long-term futures contract prices and the current spot market price, is, on average, at 8.67%. That compares with a range of 27%-31% on crypto exchanges including FTX, Deribit, Binance, and OKEx, according to crypto derivatives data provider Skew.      The difference between bitcoin futures premium on CME and other crypto exchanges has widened since the end of March, when the troubles surfaced at Bill Hwang’s Archegos Capital.      Patrick Heusser, a senior cryptocurrency trader at Zurich-based Crypto Broker AG, explained the futures premium is sometimes a function of the demand for leverage by traders on an exchange.      In a bull market like right now, “the traders who look to go long on leverage are willing to pay the premium, the cost for the leverage,” Heusser said. Because ""there is not much leverage you can take on the CME, the future premium is not that steep or big” compared with other platforms.      Read more: CME to Launch Micro Bitcoin Futures in May      In theory, the futures premium on CME should be lower than it is on other crypto exchanges due to its more restrictive trading rules and limited leverage positions, Heusser added.      Another explanation is the premium has been rising on crypto exchanges since the end of March because of traders’ bullish views on bitcoin.      There are “more overly confident traders and more leveraged longs probably,” says Bendik Norheim Schei, head of research at Arcane Research. “Traders are expecting higher prices and taking on long positions.”      Traders on retail-focused crypto-derivatives exchanges “are already in the crypto ecosystem,” Dorman said. “It’s just a completely different investor base and completely different leverage base. So what was happening is you still have really aggressive investors in the crypto world who are levering up to buy as much risk as they can.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/07/heres-how-the-archegos-debacle-may-have-spilled-over-to-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b119fde813835a73b12fcb4cb0e3a811abe61149-1500x1021.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Rating COIN a “buy,” Davidson raised the exchange's share price target from $195 to $440, which is a 20x multiple of its expected 2021 revenue. The analysts said the company’s Q1 performance was proof the crypto exchange giant could generate “healthy margins” despite the uncertainty of the bitcoin markets.

While that share count may change, it ""does imply a $90 billion market cap,” said Gil Luria, head of institutional research at Davidson.

42434120,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP8Rfh,1617820652,NFT Frenzy Shows Signs of Cooling but Don't Call It a Market Crash,"Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have sold for millions and drawn the attention of mainstream publications from the New York Times to Vanity Fair.      Recently, however, the tokens' prices and trading volumes have declined, raising questions on whether NFT frenzy can be sustained, according to the website tracking this corner of the cryptocurrency world.      Is an NFT market crash in the offing?      “It almost seems that some have been eagerly awaiting a market correction to finally prove that NFTs have just been in a bubble,” according to an April 6 blog post on Nonfungible.com.    “The average price of NFTs spiked quite astoundingly in February, peaking at around $4,000 in mid-February. Since then, record sales continue to follow, averaging around $1,500.”  The volume of NFT sales has also declined from a peak of 80,000 in early March to around 40,000 as of March 29. Volume tends to lag price, which could be explained by a growing interest of new buyers following record sales.  The average price of the 3 most expensive NFT type on the market peaked around $95,951 last month before declining by about 53% in just a few weeks.  However, NFT average values tend to fluctuate over time, according to data from Nonfungible.com going back to May 2020.    The slowdown could calm what some experts have described as an NFT frenzy and bring inflated values to more reasonable levels. After all, market stability is important for professional investors who view long-term potential for NFTs.      It's not enough of a pullback to call it an NFT market crash, though, Nonfungible.com said in the post. For example, the current average price of an NFT is about 10 times what it was six months ago.      ""The trend seems more to show a stabilization on a high plateau following a speculative peak,"" according to the website. In other words, if there's an NFT bubble, it hasn't popped.      Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at Arca, a cryptocurrency investment firm, wrote Tuesday in a newsletter he sees further growth coming to the NFT space.      “NFTs will expand beyond current use cases such as collectibles, art and gaming into more traditional use case,” wrote. “Companies and projects that facilitate the growth and trading of NFTs could be big winners.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Damanick Dantes,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/07/nft-frenzy-shows-signs-of-cooling-but-dont-call-it-a-market-crash,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/24780f7e720a1bc5070183a57927958dae4e4d82-1200x1186.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434111,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP8RLh,1617819542,"Miners, Front-Running-as-a-Service Is Theft","We’d like to announce a great new idea we’ve devised to reform the police.      Today, cities direct their police forces to prevent and prosecute theft. But crime is a tough problem, and policing is costly. What cities should do instead is auction off the right to mug people and burglarize homes. Sure, burglaries would become more professional to take advantage of any vulnerable property. But on the bright side, cities can use theft auction money to pay city workers’ salaries, offset shortfalls in tax revenue and fund new policing initiatives (including prosecution of unauthorized theft).    Ari Juels is the Weill Family Foundation and Joan and Sanford I. Weill Professor in the Jacobs Institute at Cornell Tech, co-director of the Initiative for CryptoCurrencies and Contracts (IC3) and chief scientist at Chainlink Labs. Ittay Eyal is an assistant professor at Technion and an associate director at IC3. Mahimna Kelkar is a PhD student in computer science at Cornell University and Cornell Tech.    Horrendous idea? Yes, it is. And it’s now starting to happen in Ethereum, thanks to new projects, such as Flashbots, and practices by miners, that systematize exploitation of users.    The Miner Extractable Value (MEV) problem    A paradoxical limitation of most blockchain protocols, including Ethereum and Eth 2.0, is that while their key feature is decentralization, they are ephemerally centralized.      When miners (or validators) form a block, they have the power to decide unilaterally what transactions to include and how to order them. The miner can’t include bogus transactions or directly steal money from users, so this limited power may seem insignificant. But in a smart contract system, transaction order impacts the flow of money, giving miners more sway.      Consider, for example, an automated market maker (AMM) that allows assets to be traded without counterparties within a decentralized finance (DeFi) system. Buying Token X from the AMM causes the price of Token X to rise (with respect to a paired asset). A miner can exploit this when Alice is about to buy some Token X in a transaction T. If the miner gets to include T in a block it mines, it can do the following.      The miner creates two of its own transactions, Tpre and Tpost and sandwiches T between them. In other words, it includes the three transactions in the order Tpre T, Tpost. The miner’s transaction Tpre buys someToken X, while its transaction Tpost sells the Token X it’s bought. Because Alice’s transaction T causes the price of Token X to rise, the miner makes money: It’s selling Token X for more than it paid for it. But where does the miner’s profit come from? Because the miner’s buy transaction, i.e., transaction Tpre also causes the price of Token X to rise, Alice pays more than she would have if she weren’t attacked by the miner. In other words, the miner is taking money from Alice.      See also: Valid Points - Yes, Front-Running Will Still Exist on Ethereum 2.0      A 2019-2020 study with the (condensed) title ""Flashboys 2.0"" explored this phenomenon (one of us was a co-author.) The paper coined the term Miner Extractable Value (MEV) for arbitrage opportunities available to miners as well as to bots, which can also perform front-running by paying high gas prices. The study showed a sophisticated community of bots was already profiting from MEV in Ethereum. It also explained that the existence of MEV can destabilize consensus in a proof-of-work blockchain, threatening the integrity of the blockchain itself.      MEV exists in all kinds of places, mostly around decentralized exchanges, but also in unexpected places, like CryptoKitty birthing. In fact, there are bots lurking around the Ethereum mempool waiting to discover new MEV opportunities by copying users’ transactions. Dan Robinson, of Paradigm, suggested the term “Dark Forest” to describe this behavior, which he encountered when trying to recover funds from a broken contract.    Front-running-as-a-service    MEV has been a serious problem for some time, but things are now getting worse.      Miners are realizing that they control transaction ordering and can profit from this power. (Anything that bots can do, miners can do better.) Some miners are embracing an idea called front-running-as-a-service (FaaS) (aka MEV Auctions (MEVA) or MEV optimization), as realized by Flashbots.      FaaS is analogous to the theft auctions we (facetiously) suggested at the beginning of this post. Instead of miners developing front-running expertise themselves, in a FaaS system, miners auction off the right to front-run users. Specialist arbitrageurs can bid off-chain in real time to place their front-running transactions in mined blocks. The winner of a FaaS auction pays the hammer price to the miner in exchange for having its transactions placed as desired.      Proponents make several arguments in favor of FaaS:    MEV extraction is unavoidable, so let’s make the best of it: A common defense of FaaS is that MEV is inherent in blockchain protocols. FaaS is therefore helpful because it streamlines MEV extraction, eliminating “negative externalities” such as mempool and on-chain congestion caused by bots competing for juicy arbitrage opportunities.  Miners are at risk of impoverishment: The Ethereum Improvement Proposal 1559 (EIP-1559), a proposed change to the Ethereum fee structure, is slated to go live this July. EIP-1559 alters fees in a way that some miners fear will diminish their revenue from transaction fees. Some have suggested that MEV can make up for this lost revenue.  FaaS systems can be used to rescue CryptoKitties and other non-fungible tokens. FaaS allows a user whose private key has been compromised to transfer an NFT in a privately mined transaction without tipping off and getting front-run by an attacker to whom the key has leaked.  Fair transaction ordering    FaaS (and MEV in general) has no underlying principles or notion of fairness and social benefit. Taking advantage of extractable value is, in general, not a service for society, but often the contrary.      As Ed Felten, of Princeton and Offchain Labs, has astutely pointed out, FaaS is essentially a cost imposed on users willy-nilly by miners without any underlying technical or ethical principles, without a principled calibration of cost size and without any form of community agreement. It’s as though City Hall decided unilaterally to implement theft auctions to make up for a shortfall in municipal tax revenue and without much thought about which homes will be burglarized.      Looking at the arguments for FaaS: CryptoKitty rescue is, well, a noble activity, but not worth cheating the users. As for miner impoverishment, we don’t have strong opinions on how much miners should be compensated, but FaaS, as we’ve said, isn’t based on forethought about this question.      See also: Bad Sandwich: DeFi Trader ‘Poisons’ Front-Running Miners for $250K Profit      In addition to ethical concerns about FaaS, we are concerned it will tarnish the reputation of the smart contract ecosystem and ultimately attract unwanted attention from regulators, which have penalized companies such as Robinhood for systematizing similar practices in traditional financial markets.      Almost everyone agrees that the current state of MEV on Ethereum is bad, so why not instead try to avoid MEV altogether? Would you rather improve security to prevent burglaries, or regularize crime and redistribute its profits? We claim that MEV is avoidable even though some FaaS proponents like Flashbots seem to have already given up.      Researchers are already making strides in the direction of reducing or removing MEV by constructing protocols (permissioned and permissionless) that fundamentally order transactions fairly to begin with. Indeed, ideas to prevent some forms of front-running – such as keeping transactions encrypted while they’re ordered – have been around for decades.      Implementing these ideas is certainly not trivial, and requires substantial research, but so, too, do many other worthwhile endeavors in the blockchain community, like layer 2 systems and migration to less energy-intensive forms of mining. It is possible that MEV is in some degree inescapable, as financial systems are complex and invariably involve trade-offs. Our point is that research into the root cause and foundational solutions for MEV should be community priorities.    There is another way    While FaaS may seem an attractive way to address the MEV problem, it makes sense only as part of a false narrative that there’s no other way. But there are alternative approaches to ordering transactions that provide stronger fairness assurances for users. Those approaches deserve to be tried before FaaS becomes the norm.      Decentralized systems offer an unprecedented opportunity to rebuild the financial system on a more inclusive, more democratic, and fairer basis – to help level the tilted playing field created by Wall Street. Let’s not blow it just to pick a few users’ pockets.

42434110,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP8RJh,1617816687,$1B Fei Stablecoin's Rocky Start Is a Wake-Up Call for DeFi Investors,"The $1 billion Fei Protocol stablecoin project has gotten off to a very rocky start.      The most important data point is this: Fei was built to maintain a 1:1 peg with the U.S. dollar but it has not quite hit the mark over this first week of its existence.      Backed by major VCs, Fei aimed to create a stablecoin protocol that would outright buy assets with its token, rather than holding them as collateral for loans. It appears the team underestimated the demand it would see to participate in the launch. It also seems clear that many of those who jumped into the project didn't understand Fei’s ""direct incentive"" method for stabilizing the price.      FEI’s struggles show that the launch of a new decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol is not a sure path to easy money, despite what many individual investors may have come to assume. The episode could be the tipping point where retail investors realize they have to be more judicious about hopping in, perhaps erring on the side of longer-term aims rather than the quick buck.      For the first few days FEI danced around a nickel to a dime off the target. Since yesterday it has tanked hard, now almost a quarter off its goal of $1, according to CoinGecko.    Fei's main technique for maintaining its peg to the dollar not only hasn't worked, each time it kicks in it briefly makes matters worse.    Right now the outstanding question is whether Fei as we know it will persist. It's a stablecoin that's much too volatile. Stablecoins have proved to be very valuable, in particular to crypto traders. They allow traders to exit quickly from short-term trades and lock in gains with an asset whose price won't move. The most successful stablecoins thus far have relied on the U.S. dollar, and obviously crypto's true believers want to escape fiat.      Fei's main technique for maintaining its peg to the dollar not only hasn't worked, each time it kicks in it briefly makes matters worse.      The situation underscores just how difficult it is to make a purely algorithmic stablecoin, something of a persistent albatross for cryptocurrency entrepreneurs especially excited about the idea of programmable money.      ""It’s hard to make an algorithmic stablecoin stick to the peg, and mechanisms are nascent and experimental,” said Jake Brukhman, founder and CEO of investment firm CoinFund. “I don’t have much skin in the game on $FEI, but I am supportive of figuring it out for the benefit of science and the blockchain space.""      The Fei team did not reply to multiple requests for comment from CoinDesk by press time.    Context    The Fei Protocol innovates on the model of a decentralized stablecoin by creating a system where users directly purchase the stablecoin from a protocol that is capable of owning the assets used to purchase it.      Here's a simplified model of how Fei works to help illustrate. Imagine there's a smart contract that simply says: input $100 worth of ether (ETH, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization) and the contract will issue 100 FEI to whatever wallet sent in the ETH.      There's no upper bound on the amount of FEI that can be issued other than the fact the smart contract that mints it does so only when it gets purchased. FEI is made on demand, not in anticipation of it, in other words. This is mostly right, but we'll circle back to this.      For now that's the basic idea. The main protocol Fei competes with is MakerDAO. MakerDAO creates DAI as a loan. Users put up collateral and can borrow up to two-thirds of its value in DAI. Eventually they have to pay the loan back with interest to get their collateral back, though, so there is a sense that the assets still belong to the borrowers.      The big innovation is that funds put into Fei belong to Fei. Fei is created not with a debt, but a trade.    Direct incentives    Fei has a few ways that it can enforce its peg to the dollar.      First, Fei created a pool on Uniswap, the decentralized trading protocol, that it uses to support the peg. The smart contract that controls FEI is able to create incentives for buying from and selling to that pool.      So far the price has only been below the peg, so we only need to deal with that side of the equation. FEI theoretically incentivizes users to hold by burning some FEI any time they sell to the Uniswap pool and giving them a little any time they buy from it.      In theory, this should increase buy pressure and discourage sell pressure. But it hasn't worked.      Cornell Professor Emin Gün Sirer, also the founder of the Avalanche cryptocurrency project, wrote an extended thread about Fei on Twitter Wednesday. In one tweet, on just this point, he observed, ""The penalty mechanism in FEI not only makes the supply disappear, it also makes demand disappear. It punishes both sides, and thereby narrows the feasibility envelope for the coin.""      This is also a completely new mechanic and, as we know, few people read documentation carefully (this is true well beyond DeFi). Never before has Uniswap shown a stated price but then delivered less than it stated on a trade. This happens because some FEI gets burned on a sale when FEI is underpriced. Users haven't wrapped their heads around it, but it's causing something of a panic to exit.      That's evident every time Fei exercises its other mechanic, the reweight.    The reweight    The reweight is a bit complicated, but here's a description that's as simple as possible:      Uniswap is an automated market maker, also known as a decentralized exchange (DEX). It owns no assets itself but it gives people a way to deposit pairs of assets into it and earn a little bit on trades users make with the protocol. So in an ETH/DAI pool, a user could put in 100 DAI and $100 worth of ETH and as people trade ETH for DAI and DAI for ETH the depositor would earn a tiny bit on each trade      The Fei protocol itself is the biggest supplier to the ETH/FEI pool on Uniswap. When FEI is trading below its target of $1, the protocol reweights the whole pool.      Step one: It withdraws all the ETH and FEI that it controls on the DEX.      Step two: There will still be some funds placed by others in the ETH/FEI pool, so Fei deposits the right amount, such that the funds that remain in the pool equal 1 FEI for $1 worth of ETH.      Step three: It deposits as much of its remaining ETH and FEI sufficient to maintain that ratio back into the Uniswap pool.      Step four: Some FEI will be left over after the reweight, because the market needs to reduce supply. That's why the price is below the peg. That leftover FEI gets burnt.      Lots of people want to get out of FEI right now, though, so as soon as a reweight happens, users rush to exit because that's the moment that they get the best price for FEI that they are going to get. This rush to trade leads to another plunge in value and once again FEI falls off its peg.      That's why the reweight makes things worse for a bit each time, because a reweight, ironically, creates the best moment to sell.      There's a debate in the Fei community right now about whether FEI will find its footing when more decentralized finance apps create uses for FEI or if none of them will until FEI finds its footing.      Users can hold FEI and its governance token, TRIBE, and stake them in the FEI/TRIBE Uniswap pool to earn more distributions of TRIBE. Right now, that's the only real reason to hold FEI, though, until other DeFi apps open up to it.    Collateralization    One topic that hasn't received a ton of attention is how collateralized FEI is.      In the debate noted above, one Fei supporter on the forum argued that FEI is overcollateralized. But looked at another way, it's undercollateralized.      The ETH that Fei owns now came from a launch event whereby early supporters put in ETH and got FEI at a discount (the formula was complicated). Fei acquired more than $1 billion worth of ETH this way.      So all those wallets got FEI and then the protocol kicked off the Uniswap pool. The pool would launch at 1 FEI equalling $1 of ETH. Theoretically, it should hold that peg. But where did the FEI in the Uniswap pool come from? According to the project’s white paper:      ""The FEI for this deposit comes from minting, and therefore this PCV [Protocol Controlled Value] Deposit must be appointed as a Minter by Fei Core. The amount of FEI minted is equivalent to the amount of ETH times the spot price of FEI/ETH in the pool.""      In other words, Fei just minted more FEI to match the value of ETH that went into the pool.      So (in simplified terms), a billion FEI were minted to buyers with the $1 billion worth of ETH that got spent in the launch event. Then, another billion FEI were minted to pair with that same ETH to go in the Uniswap pool.      So this is where we're circling back. One could argue that this pile of FEI in Uniswap was made in anticipation of demand and it isn't really circulating. It's more efficient, in terms of on-chain computation (“gas”) fees, for a user to buy it on Uniswap this way than to go straight to Fei. So it could be argued it's fair not to think of the Uniswap FEI as real FEI until someone buys it.      That's why the Fei analytics page shows a protocol controlled value (PCV) of $1.3 billion. This is how much assets Fei's smart contracts own. But the market cap of FEI is $2.2 billion.      Looked at one way: FEI in a Uniswap pool isn't exactly circulating supply. Looked at another way: well, we don't look at any other assets that exist inside Uniswap as not part of circulating supply.      This realization may factor into some of the anxiety around Fei now. With $1 billion worth of ETH at hand, it could have bought some of the newly minted FEI off the market to create the Uniswap pool. It would have been a smaller pool, but this is also a new token.    Modifications to come    Nascent Capital's Dan Elitzer, a backer of Fei, does not think this is the true issue, however. He told CoinDesk over Twitter DM, ""I find it hard to believe that people are selling because they think it's undercollateralized; they're selling because a lot of them aped into a system they didn't understand, thinking there was a pure arb opportunity. There just isn't enough natural demand for FEI at this point given the massive initial supply, hence the sell pressure.""      The Fei team is considering a number of options to hit the peg now. Joey Santoro, the founder, kicked off the discussion, with options such as having reweights occur at regular intervals and reigning in the direct incentives so users are less reluctant to make moves.      Conversation around the options Santoro presented centered on the need for use cases for FEI. Another holder, going by fei.saver, came in to say that the peg is more important than usage, urging modifications that would increase the pace of reweights.      The discussion has been active ever since. Santoro, the founder, for his part, has voiced support in the forums for increasing the cadence of reweights and easing up on the incentives built into the Uniswap pool.      In the FEI Discord forum on Tuesday, he wrote: ""@Everyone the PCV is safe and the protocol is still overcollateralized, we will move forward with a solution to help allow FEI to exchange for the fair market price.""      As Brukhman put it, ""Experimenters will experiment.""",NEGATIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | TRADING | UNI,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/07/1b-fei-stablecoins-rocky-start-is-a-wake-up-call-for-defi-investors,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1801a249eb1834a0b56760b9fd99b09cb86bacf8-1316x878.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

And the episode speaks to the surprising malleability of legislators when, after a year of crafting massive legislation, you catch them off guard. Allow me to explain.    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    West Virginia’s Legislature is considering a sweeping overhaul to the state’s criminal code – its biggest in decades – with a package delegates have been sharpening for nearly a year. Their 400-page behemoth would strengthen drug sentencing, expand homicide provisions, modernize anti-hacking statutes and establish a tiered system for misdemeanors and felonies.      Pretty normal fare for a criminal code overhaul. But I noticed something strange last week in House Bill 2017. It seemed to ban people from issuing or transacting in cryptocurrencies not sanctioned by the 38th most populous state in the U.S.      “If any person shall, without authority of law, issue any note, cryptocurrency, or other security purporting that money or other thing of value is payable by or on behalf of such person, with intent thereby to create a circulating medium, he or she shall be guilty of a misdemeanor,” read the section 61-4-7 of the bill. (Cryptocurrency, bolded here, was new to the “unauthorized currency” provision).      Huh? Was this a crypto ban? I wasn’t sure. The following section, 61-4-8, only made me more confused:      “If any person … shall knowingly pass or receive in payment any such note, cryptocurrency, or security, he or she shall be guilty of a Class 3 misdemeanor.”      Sure looked like a crypto ban to me. But I’m no lawyer. Hell, I haven’t even ordered those LSAT study books yet. (Sorry, Mom!) So I emailed a few real attorneys to hear their take.    ‘Very curious’    Drew Hinkes of Carlton Fields responded first. “This bill would benefit from further clarification,” he began. Not a very promising start.      HB 2017’s “very curious definition” of cryptocurrency was unlikely to spell a sweeping ban on digital assets or any crypto with supposed intrinsic value (bitcoin), Hinkes explained. Rather, it seemed tailored to “cryptocurrencies that promise payment to the holder,” or perhaps asset-backed stablecoins with redeemable reserves.      (My favorite example of an asset-backed, redeemable crypto is sardine coin. Holders can exchange their tokens for a vintage tin of salty fish. That European initial coin offering is, alas, not available to U.S. residents. More relevant are dollar-pegged stablecoins like USDT, USDC and DAI, which are backed by fiat currency in a brick-and-mortar bank and/or other assets and boast a combined market capitalization of $56 billion, or 77% of West Virginia’s annual GDP.)      Carol Van Cleef of Bradley was my next stop. She deemed the proposal “disturbing” and said it would render authorized stablecoins “as a nonfactor in payments.”      “When I see something like this – my first question is where did it come from, who is behind and why,” she said.      I agreed. So I found the emails of the bill’s 11 co-sponsors and contacted them en masse.            I did not realize it then, but Wednesday was set to be a banner day for HB 2017. After nearly a year of drafting and committee work, it was headed for final vote on third reading. The cryptocurrency rider had been in there from the start and it was just hours away from passing.    ‘Your contribution is appreciated’    I woke up to a cordial email from Delegate Bryan Ward. “Good morning, sir,” wrote the first-term member. “This bill was voluminous and technical amendments are forthcoming in an effort to perfect the language.”      “An amendment, specifically addressing your concern relating to cryptocurrency will be offered by Delegate Daniel Linville. I’m fortunate to have colleagues here in the house of delegates with broad ranging expertises. Your contribution to the process of crafting the best bill is appreciated.”      What? My contribution to the crafting of a better bill? I am not a constituent of West Virginia nor am I a registered lobbyist. I know how to report, not how to influence. I was not sure what was going on.      Linville, who chairs the Technology and Infrastructure Committee, emailed me the amendment he would propose on the floor of the house of delegates later that day. It would strike all mentions of cryptocurrency from section 61-4-7.      “This should be taken up within the next few hours,” he said.      So I tuned into the livestream on YouTube. Indeed, a few hours later, Linville asked his fellow delegates to adopt his amendment. He said he had met with the bill’s co-sponsor that morning and decided to excise cryptocurrency from the law. Better to remove a few words than pass a bill suggesting crypto was counterfeit money, he said. Would his fellow delegates sign on?      “Aye,” agreed the chamber by voice vote, adopting the amendment. Nobody stood in his way.      HB 2017 then passed the House by a vote of 76 to 22.    Something is amiss    Shortly after the bill’s passage I began reviewing my notes. It sure seemed that I had acted like a last-minute lobbyist for the cryptocurrency industry – though I hadn’t meant to do it. I had found a bill confusing, interviewed lawyers who also found the bill confusing, and then dug up the email addresses of 11 politicians who, when prompted, found their bill confusing, too.      “This bill was voluminous and technical amendments are forthcoming in an effort to perfect the language,” Ward had said to me.“Your contribution to the process of crafting the best bill is appreciated.”      (I have emailed Linville and Ward to ask if the amendment was being planned even before I reached out, but have not heard back.)      All this happened in the final moments before the bill’s passage in the house. On the third reading.      But it’s a good thing for the crypto industry I am not a lobbyist because, despite torpedoing the stablecoin provision without even trying, I still wouldn’t be a very effective one. Remember, there were two sections of this bill in question, the first (61-4-7) to make unauthorized stablecoin issuance illegal and a second (61-4-8) to bar the transfer of such cryptos between parties.      Also remember: An amendment “specifically addressing my concern” had been offered and approved. I had only mentioned 61-4-7 in my email. Likewise, the amendment only did away with the ban in cryptocurrency issuance. Which means that if the bill is enacted into law, it would still … ban crypto transfers?      I’m really not sure. And neither was Hinkes, the lawyer who thought the bill’s previous rendition warranted a rewrite.      “Without 'cryptocurrency’ in [section 7], [section 8] makes less sense,” he told me, pointing out the statute’s “any such” clause references a cryptocurrency that's no longer there. Perhaps the courts could enforce the ghost clause through complicated judicial jiu-jitsu, but probably not.      ""Again, this bill as amended would benefit from further clarity,” he said.      The bill is now up for consideration in the West Virginia Senate.

But from a long-term perspective, the uptrend remains intact.      That’s important to consider as some cryptocurrency traders get caught up in short-term volatility, according to Katie Stockton, technical analyst at Fairlead Strategies.    “The breakouts that we’ve already seen in bitcoin have already been exceeded,” said Stockton during an interview on CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover."" She prefers to see a decisive breakout from the current consolidation phase in order to derive an upside target.  Despite the pickup in short-term volatility, Stockton determined that intraday declines of about 3%-6% are less impactful on the chart. This suggests ongoing support from trend and momentum indicators.  As BTC consolidates, traders could look to altcoins for upside potential. “The rotation out of bitcoin is certainly happening to the benefit of these other cryptos.”  Stockton uses a relative rotation graph (RRG) to measure five-day trend and momentum of altcoins versus BTC.  EOS has outperformed BTC over the past five days, while ether (ETH) has shifted from the improving quadrant to the leading quadrant over the same time period. However, Stockton mentioned, a pullback below $1,974 in ETH could register a failed breakout, giving way to a deeper pullback or additional consolidation.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,ALTCOIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Damanick Dantes,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/07/bitcoin-still-has-support-from-long-term-uptrend-says-technical-analyst-katie-stockton,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2682e845858f26f4a892eb59448cb4635ba34000-1079x899.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In an announcement Wednesday, Riot Blockchain said it plans to buy the S19j Antminers machines for $138.5 million; once active, these additional miners would increase the firm’s bitcoin mining hashrate by 93%.  Riot said it is expecting the first batch of 3,500 S19j Antminers to be delivered in November with additional monthly deliveries expected to continue through to October 2022.  Since 2019, Riot has made nearly $230 million worth of purchase agreements with the mining hardware supplier Bitmain.  “By nearly doubling its planned hashrate capacity, Riot continues to take great strides forward in growing both the company’s and the United States’ share of the global network hashrate,” said Megan Brooks, COO of Riot.  As reported by CoinDesk, bitcoin’s hashrate, which is a way to measure the total power consumption and mining output of the network, has topped a new all-time high as mining firms like Riot continue to add more hash power.

42434124,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP8Rlh,1617809567,How Coinbase's Wild Earnings Stack Up Against Normie Financial Firms,"Based on earnings estimates announced Tuesday, nothing else in the financial services industry really compares to Coinbase right now.      Wedded to the rising fortunes of cryptocurrencies themselves, soon-to-list Coinbase expects to make more money in the first quarter of this year than in all of 2020, and has seen an exponential rise in engaged customers.      Coinbase’s revenue for the first three months of 2021 is expected to be $1.8 billion with earnings of about $800 million, compared with $1.3 billion in revenue and earnings of $322 million for all of 2020. Crypto is booming right now, with bitcoin holding its own not far below $60,000.      Ahead of next week's listing of COIN stock, the obvious question is whether the current quarter is an outlier or, as some stolid crypto believers may be thinking, the new normal.    Read more: Coinbase Is Going Public: Everything You Need to Know    In this respect, seasoned crypto watchers will recall that Coinbase reported bumper revenue of close to $1 billion in 2017, and close to half of that was booked in December of that year when the price of bitcoin rose to then-all-time highs near $20,000.      Still, when Coinbase does list on April 14, Wall Street will have to sit up and take notice, and also begin comparing the stock to other listed brokerage and investment firms.      It’s hard to predict how long the crypto industry’s current upswing will last, but it’s fun to compare large listed trading firms with Coinbase, especially because it has been an unusual year for everyone.      In fact, 2020 was a huge year for the retail investing industry, thanks to the COVID-19 lockdown, the explosion of interest around WallStreetBets and also large plays like brokerage giant Charles Schwab’s acquisition of rival TD Ameritrade.    Coinbase vs. everyone    Schwab added 15.77 million new clients in the fourth quarter, which includes 14.5 million new brokerage accounts from the TD Ameritrade merger. The merged company now has about 29 million brokerage accounts and handled some $6.69 trillion in client assets at the end of 2020.      Coinbase saw its monthly active users jump from 2.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 to 6.1 million in the first quarter of 2021. The overall number of people with Coinbase accounts increased from 43 million last year to 56 million. Total assets on Coinbase's platform increased from $90 billion to $223 billion, nearly a 150% increase quarter over quarter.      Meanwhile, Robinhood, which added crypto as an asset class to its commission-free trading platform back in 2018, saw its transaction volume double in 2020 (boosted in no small part by WSB-type trading in GameStop and AMC Theatres), and its daily average revenue trades outperformed publicly traded, incumbent brokerage firms like Schwab.    Read more: Riding Bitcoin Surge, Coinbase Active Users Grew by 117% in Q1 2021; Revenue Tops $1.8B    Robinhood, which has over 13 million customers, also offers an interesting comparison with Coinbase in that the brokerage platform has announced its intention to list later this year. An increase in the price of Robinhood shares in secondary market trading could see the app reach a $40 billion valuation, about twice the figure predicted back in December.      When Coinbase debuts on Nasdaq later this month, it's expected to command a value of about $100 billion. Even based on a conservative value of $300 a share, Coinbase is now worth more than InterContinental Exchange (ICE) Group, the owner of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). ICE reported earnings of $2.1 billion in 2020.      The crypto space is understandably in a state of excitement.      But this could also turn out costly. There’s a good chance Coinbase stock will be driven up in price by Wall Street investors who don’t fully understand crypto cyclicality, and who are probably not considering a possible 50% pullback in bitcoin's price down the line.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/04/07/how-coinbases-wild-earnings-stack-up-against-normie-financial-firms,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8cf3e51c194004524dd55f68d448b940ff206ac5-1500x845.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The development studio has acquired B-Harvest, a decentralized finance project that has developed on Cosmos since the early days and which runs one of Cosmos’ validator nodes. Tendermint would not disclose all the details and dollar amount behind the acquisition, but it includes a four-year vesting of ATOM tokens.    Read more: Tendermint Launches $20M Venture Fund to Boost Development Across Cosmos    Tendermint will integrate B-Harvest’s Gravity DEX into Cosmos to facilitate “trustless and permissionless” trades, Tendermint’s CEO Peng Zhong told CoinDesk.      “We started working with B-Harvest in October because we were looking for a team with experience in finance and DeFi to create a decentralized exchange. With the Gravity DEX, it’s designed not just to be a native exchange for ATOM, but an exchange for tokens that use other blockchains, as well,” Zhong said.      One of the more ambitious crypto projects, Cosmos is a network hub that connects other blockchains using “bridges.” The network supports both public and private blockchains with the ultimate goal of creating a nexus where all these different blockchains and coins can interact.      Zhong said the Ethereum bridge is in testnet and could be live as soon as the DEX launches, while bridges for Bitcoin and other chains would come later. As with Uniswap and other decentralized markets, anyone with the technical savvy will be able to write a contract for the Cosmos blockchain to integrate a coin or trading pair, Zhong said.      Tendermint estimates Gravity DEX will be live in June or shortly after, depending on the outcomes of a $200,000 Gravity DEX testnet competition.

As have several of its Wall Street peers, JPMorgan has warmed to cryptocurrencies in recent months.  In November, Dimon acknowledged that ""very smart people"" are buying into bitcoin, although it's still not his ""cup of tea,"" reiterating his longstanding belief that governments will ultimately regulate it more heavily.

Civil servants in Ukraine must declare all the property they own or use, and some chose to include crypto in their declarations, although the country currently is not regulating digital assets. A draft bill establishing the legal status of cryptocurrencies is still awaiting passage by the Ukrainian national parliament.      Still, out of 791,872 public officials who submitted their 2020 declarations in March, 652 reported owning bitcoin, Opendatabot said. Most crypto holders are members of city councils, followed by the staff of the national police, ministry of defense and the general prosecutor's office, the service reported. Members of the national parliament, Verkhovna Rada, accounted for only 3.7% of high-ranking crypto holders.      The most crypto-rich civil servant in Ukraine, at least officially, is Vyacheslav Mishalov, a member of the Dnipro city council. Mishalov reported owning 18,000 bitcoin (BTC), worth more than US$1 billion, for the second year in a row. Mishalov was followed by Petro Lensky, first secretary of Ukraine's embassy in Vietnam, with 6,528 BTC in his vault. After him came Alexander Urbansky, deputy chairman of the Odessa regional council, who's got a trove of 5,328 BTC.      The number of Ukrainian public officials investing in crypto is growing, Opendatabot said. While in 2018 only 71 officials owned cryptocurrency, in 2019, that number had grown to 424, and in 2020 653 officials reported owning crypto. Most people reported owning bitcoin (61%), while other reported holding ether (24%) and smaller altcoins including litecoin, cardano, stellar and bitcoin cash.      Watching the ""whales,"" or large crypto holders, may become a new sport for Ukraine. CoinDesk previously wrote about a 19-year-old city council member in a Ukrainian town of Kramatorsk who is not only the youngest lawmaker in his city but is also a monero whale who owns millions of dollars worth of XMR.

42386432,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBSuYJ,1617786073,"Bitcoin Drops 6% in Korea, Shrinking the 'Kimchi Premium'","Bitcoin's ""kimchi premium,"" or the difference between prices on South Korean exchanges and other global avenues, declined on Wednesday as the cryptocurrency lost ground against the Korean won (KRW).    The price gap narrowed to 16% during the European hours, as bitcoin fell by over 6% to KRW 70,412,000 on the Upbit exchange, the largest in South Korea as per trading volumes, according to data source CoinGecko.  The price pullback happened after the exchange suspended KRW withdrawal and deposit service at 14:47 local time (5:47 a.m. UTC).  ""Bitcoin dropped after Upbit announced withdrawal suspension,"" Ki Young Ju, CEO of the Korea-based blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.  ""But there's also the possibility that someone figured out how to arbitrage the Kimchi premium opportunity,"" Ju added.  The Kimchi premium had swelled to a three-year high of 22% earlier Wednesday in a sign of retail frenzy.  However, executing a classic arbitrage strategy by purchasing bitcoin on western exchanges and dumping on Korean platforms is quite challenging because local exchanges only allow trading in KRW pairs, as discussed on Tuesday.  Some whales have been depositing coins on Korean exchanges, as tweeted by Ju. Investors typically move coins to exchanges when they want to liquidate their holdings.  Analysts say a potential dump in South Korea may not significantly impact bitcoin's global average because the Asian giant now contributes less than 2% of the worldwide trading volume versus 8% in 2017.  Bitcoin is currently trading near KRW 73,000,000 on Upbit and changing hands at $57,500 on major western exchanges – down 1% on the day, as per CoinDesk 20 data.

The San Francisco-based cryptocurrency firm is hoping to find evidence the regulator defined XRP at some point as being similar to bitcoin and ether, two cryptocurrencies largely accepted as non-security instruments, according to a report by Law360.      The distinction is important as the SEC is alleging Ripple and two of its executives violated U.S. securities laws in selling XRP to retail consumers. The case may lead to a court ruling on how and when a cryptocurrency is considered a security that other startups in the U.S. could use as informal guidance in the future.      The eight years taken by the regulator to file suit against Ripple is also another angle being pushed by the cryptocurrency firm as it attempts to strengthen its argument in the five-month-old case.      Granted by U.S. Judge Sarah Netburn in the Southern District Court of New York, the motion affords Ripple access to the SEC’s minutes and memos ""expressing the agency's interpretation or views"" on cryptocurrency, which Netburn said are likely discoverable. Netburn also said Ripple’s discovery was a “high-stakes” win, according to the report.

""I'm going to grant in large part the defendants' motion,"" said Netburn. As part of the ruling, staff-to-staff email communications will not have to be produced.

42386430,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBSuVn,1617762927,Final Taproot Activation Specifics Chosen With a Bitcoin Blockchain 'Coin Toss',"Bitcoin developers couldn’t settle on the specifics of Taproot’s activation, so they used a “coin toss” on the Bitcoin blockchain this Tuesday to wrap up activation discussions that began a year ago.      According to blockchain data pulled from this journalist's Bitcoin node, the result of the coin toss has determined that Taproot’s activation timeline will be measured using median time passed (MTP) instead of block height.      For the actual ""toss,"" the last digit of the block 678079's hash were used to decide the outcome where a value of 0 represented MTP and a value of 1 represented height.      Taproot – an upgrade that will enrich Bitcoin’s smart contracts – is all set to go using the “Speedy Trial” activation method outlined a month ago. Today’s coin toss settled a dispute, though, over how the Bitcoin blockchain will measure the time that has passed between when the upgrade is released and when it will “time-out.”    Block height vs. MTP    There were two options up for debate: one using “block height,” which chooses a timeout that triggers once a specific block is mined and the other using MTP, which chooses the timeout based on real-world time derived from block data.      The coin toss occurred on block 678079 and the result landed on MTP. Following the result, Bitcoin Core contributor Andrew Chow removed his pull request for a block height-based scheme.      MTP means that when Taproot’s code is shipped, miners and node operators will have a time period of exactly three months to upgrade to Taproot before a timeout period is reached.      If miners representing 90% of Bitcoin’s hashrate upgrade in this timeframe, then Taproot is “locked in” and it will activate three months after this lock-in. Assuming Taproot is shipped by May, this means the upgrade would be fully functional on the Bitcoin blockchain no later than November.      “We have two good options, and coin flip is people agreeing to put aside minute preferences on two acceptable options for the big picture,"" Bitcoin Core contributor Jeremy Rubin wrote in a Bitcoin devlist email. “As such, I think that a coin flip is appropriately used in this circumstance, although I recognize the sentiment that some may feel it's treating development a little too *flippantly*.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING,"Colin Harper, Blockspace Media",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/04/07/final-taproot-activation-specifics-chosen-with-a-bitcoin-blockchain-coin-toss,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0970c4a7e354a5c9ebcb58ea9f7cde1fb1c06a63-2560x1720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
