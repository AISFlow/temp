42379454,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX882tB,1494624056,UK's National Health Service Hit in Global Ransomware Wave,"Multiple outlets are reporting a wave of ransomware attacks affecting the UK’s National Health Service (NHS) as well as other firms throughout Europe.  The attack is said to have impaired the hospital and health service network's ability to communicate, while patient records and other resources were unavailable as well. Ransomware is a kind of malicious software that locks up a computer, demanding a ransom – typically to be paid in bitcoin – in order to unlock the files.  Reports indicate that as many as 40 offices connected to NHS were impacted, though according to The Guardian, the UK hasn’t yet moved to confirm this figure. Prime Minister Theresa May issued a statement on the attack, declaring that no patient data is believed to have been compromised.  Outlets are reporting that more than a dozen countries – and as many as 74, according to one security firm – have been affected by the hacking tool. Cybersecurity firm Kapersky Labs has said that the majority of the attacks were directed toward Russia, and that available figures may not fully represent the scale of the impact.  Some of the companies impacted include shipping giant FedEx and Spanish telecommunications giant Telefónica.  According to The New York Times, the attack is believed to have been powered by a hacking tool originally developed by the US National Security Agency and published last month by a group known as the Shadow Brokers.  It remains to be clear whether the companies affected by the attacks will pay the requested ransoms – as much as $300 in bitcoin per machine, as reports indicate. Yet bitcoin addresses highlighted in the ransomware's code by Matthieu Suiche, founder of cybersecurity firm Comae Technologies, indicate that at least some people are paying the demanded ransoms.

42379462,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8830j,1494617120,Back to Reality? Bitcoin's Price Drops $100 Amid Meteoric Month,"The price of bitcoin saw something it hasn't seen much of lately today – a 24-hour decline to the tune of triple digits.  According to figures from the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, the day-over-day decline marks a rare occurrence over the last month. Over that span, bitcoin has been largely in the green, spurred by a diversity of factors on which analysts haven't found much to agree.  The pause in price growth may be stunning, if only for the fact bitcoin has been consistently setting new all-time highs in recent trading sessions.  Analyst and trader Jacob Eliosoff, for instance, downplayed bitcoin's off-day, positioning it in perspective of bitcoin's overall gains. The price of one bitcoin is up over $700 so far this year, and up nearly $1,300 since May of last year, BPI data shows.  Still, Elisoff pointed to data that suggests bitcoin's historic corrections have been swift.  He told CoinDesk:  ""A natural question is, when the correction does come, how far will it drop? I don't know, but in the past they've been huge.""  Others projected that the price may simply be consolidating after a period of intense growth, with over-the-counter trader Charlie Shrem reporting that he believes this to be the case.  Shrem pointed to bitcoin's long-term value projections as evidence the market isn't ""satisfied"" even with the current price observed today.  And as the momentum subsides, some worry that bitcoin's past problems may now become more visible. For example, with litecoin having recently upgraded its code to scale its transaction capacity, it's possible bitcoin's scaling debate could soon again heat up.  ""I think bitcoin will be worth $5,000 or $10,000 in a few years time, but it can't get there unless we get past this scaling debate, and short-term price rallies only serve to delay us dealing with this reality,"" said angel investor and entrepreneur Vinny Lingham.  Lingham went on to note that price spikes of any severity are also more likely to make bitcoin's limited throughput apparent. ""The rewards per block keep going up,"" he remarked.  Data from Bitnodes  now suggests it costs about 240 satoshis to clear 1 byte of transactions on the network, meaning average transaction fees are now above $1.  Charles Hayer, CEO of digital currency data website CryptoCompare, agreed with Lingham.  ""In terms of capacity bitcoin is straining at the seams, whilst litecoin is streets ahead in terms of forward thinking and governance,"" he said.  While still conjecture, the comments point to potentially troubled waters ahead – or big gains if an upgrade can finally be made.  Charles Bovaird contributed reporting.

42379452,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX882mt,1494610213,Ethereum Exchange Protocol Race Heats Up With 'Swap' Launch,"Members of the ethereum development community ConsenSys have unveiled a new peer-to-peer exchange protocol.  Dubbed ""Swap"", the protocol, debuted earlier this week in a new white paper, aims to facilitate the trustless exchange of assets across the ethereum network. In most cases, users would need to take their tokens to a centralized exchange or engage in an over-the-counter setting if they want to trade today.  One key aspect, the team wrote in a blog post today, is the absence of an order book with existing bids and asks for asset trades (another recently debuted exchange protocol, 0x, uses a decentralized order book to facilitate trades). Rather, the Swap protocol connects buyers and sellers directly, triggering the exchanges out of the public eye entirely.  While the code for Swap hasn't been made open-source yet, the team behind it says it's gearing up to release it – further, they want to bring other developers in on the action as well.  ""We've designed the protocol to be straightforward and extensible and we'll open source our code soon to help kickstart app development,"" the team wrote. ""If you're a developer, we look forward to working with you to build your next token-aware application.""

42379445,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX882gb,1494605108,Palestinian Government Said to Be Considering a Bitcoin-Like Currency,"Palestine's monetary authority is reportedly looking to create its own digital currency.  Reuters  reported today that, according to Azzam Shawwa, head of the Palestinian Monetary Authority, the State of Palestine is weighing a “bitcoin-style solution” to its lack of a central currency. As Reuters points out, a mix of US dollars, euros and other regional currencies are used by Palestinians instead.  It's the absence of a Palestinian currency and the hurdles that stand in the way of launching one that appears to have drawn the Monetary Authority's attention toward a wholly digital solution. For example, according to Shawwa, the authority – which acts as the region's de facto central bank – doesn't have the ability to issue its own currency, due to the agreement that led to its establishment.  ""It will be called the Palestinian pound,"" Shawwa told the publication.  He later suggested that it might be backed by some kind of commodity, mentioning ""reserves, gold, oil"" as possible assets to underlie the currency.  If launched, it could provide much-needed digital payment rails for those living in the Palestinian territories. And as outlets reported last September, services such as PayPal have refused to service the Palestinian market.  While it's not clear at this time when the digital currency would be launched, Reuters indicated that the Palestinian Monetary Authority wants to see a debut in the next five years.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) quietly revealed the grants last week as part of its Small Business Innovation Research initiative.  Who got funded: DHS said that it parceled out a total of $9.7m between 12 companies, three of which are working with the tech. According to a release, each firm got about $750,000 to fund their research.  Here are the companies that got funds for their blockchain-related initiatives:  BlockCypher: The startup has been awarded a grant for its ""blockchain platform for multiple blockchains, applications and analytics. BlockCypher was the recipient of a $600,000 DHS grant last summer.  Digital Bazaar: According to DHS, the company is working on a ""verifiable claims project"" that utilizes ""fit-for-purpose distributed ledgers"". Like BlockCypher, Digital Bazaar was given a DHS grant in 2016.  Evernym: This Utah-based business will use the funds to support its research into ""decentralized key management using blockchain"", according to DHS.  The big picture: With the grants, the DHS is expanding the scope of its investments in blockchain.  To date, DHS – created during the George W. Bush administration in the wake of the September 11th, 2001 terrorist attacks – has been one of the more prolific government departments in the blockchain space. Similarly, a research lab funded by DHS has also conducted work on the tech, developing a bitcoin transaction analysis tool last year.

Markets slid to an average low of $1,717.42, BPI data shows, after opening at $1,807.37. The market taper comes after a blockbuster week for the digital currency's price.  The past few days have seen bitcoin shoot past $1,700 and then $1,800. Only a month ago, prices hovered around $1,200, according to data from the BPI.  At press time, the average price of bitcoin is roughly $1,754, representing a dip of about 2.9% from the opening but also a partial recovery from the day's low.

42379455,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX882rv,1494590438,Pieter Wuille's Latest Project: Making Bitcoin Harder to Lose,"One of bitcoin's most prolific developers is attempting to help with one of the payment network's longest-running issues.  Today, bitcoin is known for the new digital control of money it provides to users, not for it's usability and convenience. And if you haven't experienced it yourself, you've probably at least heard stories about users losing their private keys, accidentally sending bitcoin to the wrong address due to a typo, or some other gaffe.  To date, ideas to get around the direct use of public and private keys – long strings of characters that control bitcoin accounts – look like they're some years away. One fuzzy idea, for example, is to somehow bury them completely so that users don't even realize they're using bitcoin.  For now, though, cryptocurrencies are stuck with confusing addresses.  This is where Bitcoin Core developer Pieter Wuille's latest project Bech32 (which he is co-developing with Blockstream CTO Greg Maxwell) aims to at least steer addresses in a more user-friendly direction, if in a less revolutionary way.  The end game is a new kind of bitcoin address with capabilities baked in to help users detect when they type the wrong address.  The opportunity to make the improvement arose when bitcoin developers realized that they would need to invent an entirely new addressing scheme anyway with the possible future integration of SegWit – a controversial change proposed for bitcoin's code.  The tech upgrade, if ever implemented, works best with a new bitcoin address format.  Wuille told CoinDesk:  ""Given that we're forced to define a new standard anyway for native SegWit addresses, why not take the opportunity to introduce something better?""  He added that SegWit can also be used with existing addresses, but with ""slightly lower efficiency and security.""  Subtle shifts  It's important to note, though, that the new format won't replace the old one. Rather, it's an alternative that would be used for SegWit transactions, should they be deployed on bitcoin.  ""The old-style addresses will remain in use for all purposes they were used for before. Only native SegWit outputs will use Bech32 addresses,"" Wuille explained.  To recap, a bitcoin address is a version of a user's public key to which users can send value. Its unique identifying information is similar to a credit card number, and you can post this string on a public page or send it to a person in order to receive funds.  Right now, bitcoin addresses are encoded in the format Base58, meaning the unique ID is displayed as a string of letters and numbers.  This format already builds in a form of user protection because it cuts out six characters that look similar to each other. The subtle difference between '0' and 'O' might unintentionally trick users copying their bitcoin address from a computer screen, for instance. Rather than risk a mixup, both letters are removed completely.  Base32, a part of Bech32, takes the 'human-readable' element even further. Letters in the new addressing format are either all lower case or all upper case (not a combination).  Here's an example of the old format:    1DAY59hnbcTp36NbfvJ4pdKDfDTCS6zfpd    And, here's an example of an address in the new format:    bc1qw508d6qejxtdg4y5r3zarvary0c5xw7kv8f3t4    Next, the new format builds in a form of error detection.  Wuille has put together a demo that actually flags key entry mistakes. If you mistype the address – say you write an incorrect letter – it knows, sometimes even highlighting the erroneous letter in red.  The bitcoin improvement proposal (BIP) describing the new scheme also highlights other technical details that are more likely to interest wallet developers aiming to implement the format.  For example, Bech32 requires less space for QR codes, a barcode that you can scan with a smartphone (or other device) to retrieve a bitcoin address. Further, decoding the new format is faster than with Base58.  Looking ahead  Today, this scheme is tailored toward bitcoin addresses, those which users can make public to receive bitcoin. Yet, Wuille said at a recent meetup that the same technique could also one day be used for private keys.  A number of developers, such as the teams behind some capacity boosting Lightning Network implementations and bitcoin wallet Electrum, are looking into using the new format. Litecoin developers are, too, as the lesser-known cryptocurrency adopted the SegWit update on Wednesday.  On the other hand, while this new format was created for bitcoin, Wuille emphasized it isn't just for the cryptocurrency world, and could have applications where similar formats are used.  Base64  , for example, a widely used format that doesn't necessarily have human-readability in mind, is used for encoding all kinds of data.  If the address scheme is ever implemented, Wuille added, he expects that it will take time for users to pick up and use the new technology, since both senders and receivers need to support it to make a successful transaction.  This has been the case for pay-to-script hash (P2SH) addresses, which are addresses for more advanced (and less used) bitcoin transactions types, such as those that require two out of three participants to sign off on sending money.  Wuille concluded:  ""The point is just that if we ever want to be able to use native SegWit, a standard for its addresses needs to be defined and available for a long time beforehand.""  Correction: An earlier version misstated that SegWit ""requires"" a new format. This has been corrected.

42399865,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyviE,1494586840,The PayPal Moment: When Bitcoin Met Mainstream Payments,"Steve Beauregard is serial entrepreneur, co-founder of cryptocurrency payment processing startup GoCoin and chief revenue officer at Bloq.  In this entry in CoinDesk's ""Bitcoin Milestones"" series, Beauregard looks back on the day PayPal began accepting bitcoin – giving its stamp of approval to a technology many believed had the potential to disrupt it.      It's a Monday in Bitropolis, but not just any Monday.  For nearly three months, the GoCoin team had kept painfully silent on the biggest bitcoin news story in the industry to date. In 12 short hours, the press embargo would lift, the news would jolt the financial world and GoCoin would be cemented in history alongside BitPay and Coinbase as the startups that ushered one of the world's largest payment companies into cryptocurrencies.  Yet, on the eve of that very announcement, our inclusion was far from certain.    ***    When I founded GoCoin along with Brock Pierce in mid-2013, we discussed that we may be too late.  BitPay had been offering payment services to online merchants for well over a year, touting they had signed up 10,000 merchants. Coinbase announced they had signed up the first major retailer, Overstock, to accept bitcoin.  GoCoin had raised a modest seed round and was ""heads down"" in development while BitPay and Coinbase continued to one up each other with increasingly impressive announcements – Gyft, CheapAir, Virgin Galactic and Dell.  It felt like every day GoCoin wasn't live would mark another major merchant lost to BitPay or Coinbase.  In response, I was putting intense pressure on the development team to compress the Go Live schedule. My system architect, Margot Ritcher, and lead developer, my nephew Kevin Beauregard, agreed we could cut a month out of the schedule if we compromised on the multi-blockchain, multi-coin design. The downside of taking the shortcut, would be a major software rewrite.  As you will see later in the story, taking the extra time to keep the multi-blockchain design proved to be the right decision.    ***    Finally, in December 2013, GoCoin announced that it was taking donations for the Boys and Girls Club of Santa Monica. We were finally in the race, and I ramped up my Series A fundraising efforts. With the price of bitcoin having gone from the $100 to over $1,000 in the previous months, booking VC meetings on Sand Hill Road was never easier.  In early 2014, GoCoin firmly planted a flag on the cryptocurrency moon by announcing support for litecoin and dogecoin payments. The bitcoin purists lost their minds: ""You are ruining bitcoin, altcoins are a joke!"" On Reddit, people decreed: ""You are scammers taking these scam coins!""  Those were the nicest comments I can publish here.  ***  While the GoCoin team learned to operate the business, I already had $2.5m committed of our $5m Series A funding with about $1m already in the bank.  But our fundraising efforts came to a screeching halt when news broke that Mt Gox, the largest bitcoin exchange, had been the victim of a major heist where about 25% of all bitcoin in circulation had been stolen.  The entire industry was in a state of shock and chaos, funding options instantly dried up and even those that had committed to our round never funded. My board decided, rather than fight the market, to just close our Series A, which together with the seed capital came to a skinny $1.5m.  Despite the modest raise, GoCoin was still the best funded LA bitcoin startup at the time. We had negotiated a very favorable top floor lease overlooking Santa Monica's Third Street Promenade.  GoCoin also sublet space to fellow blockchain startups, developers, lawyers, accountants and provided space for meetups and the first bitcoin ATM in LA.  We named the space 'Bitropolis'.    ***    In the months that followed, GoCoin gained steady traction with our strategy of supplementing bitcoin payments with other alternative digital currencies.  In many cases, we convinced early adopters like CheapAir, KnCMiner and eGifter to add GoCoin so as to not ""limit their customer to only bitcoin"". We also continued to shake things up by announcing Larry Flint's Hustler brand as a high-profile merchant.  By 22nd September, 2014, the GoCoin directors assembled in offices of embedded Bitropolis attorney Adam Ettinger. Perhaps more importantly than the impact the big announcement would have on financial institutions, we were finally getting validation that our naysayers were wrong.  Bitcoin is not ""only used by drug dealers"", ""a Ponzi scheme"" or a ""joke""!  Why the emergency meeting? On the eve of the announcement, an email with the heart-stopping subject line ""GoCoin AML Compliance"" hit my inbox.  At the 11th hour, they are requesting a ""full assessment"" from our attorney and we had to decide how to respond.    ***    The questions were flying around the room, did one of our competitor's investors pull some strings to knock us out? By ""full assessment"", did they want a legal opinion? Were they looking for an excuse to dismiss us? Was this simply a routine checklist and a box remained unchecked?  In the previous months, GoCoin had stealthily worked with engineers, business development, marketing, PR and, of course, the legal department of PayPal. The technical hoops to integrate GoCoin's payment platform into PayPal's PaymentHub were trivial compared to the due diligence process.  We had a full legal opinion from a top Isle of Man law firm. They reviewed our compliance program extensively, requesting we tighten up aspects of our on-boarding procedures and add payment monitoring features. Most importantly, we had to satisfy their legal team that our compliance program was not only solid, but that we were continuing to improve it.  Even with that, BitPay had raised $30m from Index Ventures and Coinbase $25m from A16z. It would not have been surprising for PayPal to toss out our small scrappy undercapitalized startup.  At 9pm, our attorney sent a carefully worded ""assessment"", but certainly well short of a legal opinion. The response came back from PayPal: ""Thanks. That's all we needed.""  On the morning of 23rd September, PayPal announced it would begin accepting bitcoin, litecoin and dogecoin payments via GoCoin, and bitcoin payments via Coinbase and BitPay. Within minutes, the price of all three coins spiked.  Reddit was buzzing, and thanks to the superb strategy of my PR goddess Amanda Coolong, my phone was ringing off the hook with reporters asking about the GoCoin deal with PayPal.  History was made.    ***    Yet, soon after signing this milestone agreement, parent company eBay announced they were spinning off PayPal. As a result, PayPal's blockchain ambitions were pushed to the back-burner.  As I reflect on it, in terms of mainstream merchant adoption for online payments, I would have to say late 2014 to early 2015 was the first big peak. At the time, GoCoin was signing up about 750 merchants per month, including top brands like MovieTickets.com, Lionsgate Films and Re/MAX.  Even though many of the merchants didn't get the volume of transactions they had hoped for, their brands were now regarded as innovators.  Bitcoin exchanges and merchant processors were the bitcoin 1.0 trailblazers that brought bitcoin out of the shadows of the dark web and started to lift the reputational stain left by Silk Road.  After four years at the helm, I have stepped down as CEO of GoCoin, yet I remain on the board of the parent company. GoCoin has been profitable for nearly two years now, and I still believe there is a bright future for the company and blockchain merchant payments. That said, the industry needs to mature in order to see the kind of growth we envisioned back in 2014, and I feel I can affect more change outside of GoCoin than I can from within.  Recently, I join the Bloq team founded by Matt Roszak and former Bitcoin core developer Jeff Garzik. I've always had tremendous respect for both, and I’m thrilled they have welcomed me in as a partner.  My thesis for merchant payments is that the largest and most successful companies will likely implement their own payment systems.    While it is not exactly clear what those systems will look like, I still believe today, as I did when we were designing the GoCoin platform, we paved the way for a multi-network, multi-chain and multi-token world.

Last month, HM Land Registry began searching for new board members and, in a notice published to its website, also detailed its plans for a so-called 'Digital Street' – an upcoming scheme the office hopes will improve the speed and efficiency by which titles change hands.  It's for this purpose that the Land Registry is eyeing blockchain as a possible solution.  What they’re doing: While the document itself is decidedly short on details, here's what the office said in its note, which touches on some of objectives of the project (and hints at where blockchain may fit in):  ""In order to meet Government commitments, Land Registry will need to become more digitized and customer-centric. In the near future, we expect Land Registry will begin a live test of a 'Digital Street' which would enable the ownership of property to be changed close to instantaneously. The Digital Street would also allow Land Registry to hold more granular data than is possible at present. Blockchain is one of the underlying technologies that will be trialled.""  The big picture: While it remains unclear when the tests will take place (or what potential platforms the Land Registry will experiment with), the development nonetheless represents the latest example of a public agency looking to blockchain tech as a mechanism for cataloging changes in land ownership.  Several countries have moved to test the tech for this purpose. Sweden, for example, initiated the second phase of a test as recently as March. Regulatory hurdles, however, could hamper any attempts to bring that project to commercial scale, its organisers said.  Similar undertakings are being pursued by the government in Brazil, and the state of Illinois, too, is working on a land registry project as part of a wide-ranging blockchain initiative.

With that question, MEP Jakob von Weizsäcker kicked off a session of discussion yesterday held at the European Parliament (EP) and centered on the future of blockchain regulation in the 28-nation economic bloc.  The ""Spotlight on Blockchain"" workshop, hosted jointly by the European Parliament and the European Commission, gathered representatives from across the blockchain sector to discuss use cases and platform security.  Part of the program of the Blockchain Observatory, a formal fact-finding initiative launched in April and funded with €500,000, the aim was to cautiously approach the who, what and why of blockchain legislation.  As such, von Weizsäcker went on to posit an answer to his question:  ""It's probably too early to intervene at this stage, because we as legislators don't yet see sufficiently clearly to know what the main issues are going to be – so in order to not to stifle innovation, we don't want it to be now.""  Peteris Zilgalvis, head of the European Commission's Startups and Innovation Unit, explained that the term 'workshop' was chosen to reflect the collaborative intention of the session.  ""We don't want to just talk. We also want to listen, and we want to enable,"" Zilgalvis told CoinDesk.  Von Weizsäcker stressed the desire of the European Union (EU) to monitor, not suffocate, and pointed out that its role is to respond to the needs of constituents. To this end, the EP wants to get a feel for the sector, since ""there is a public interest in what's going on"".  Overall, this interest was evident in the room, where every seat was full and stand-ups were lining the back wall. There, parliament members, financial enterprises, academics and blockchain businesses were eager to hear more about what could be the first step toward building a comprehensive policy that would clarify development in the future.  Forward outlook  Far from delivering the expected conciliatory and safe platitudes, the comments from moderators and panelists alike showed a willingness to recognize the urgent need for a new understanding and new rules, as well as a strong desire to overcome the difficulties in deciding what those rules should be.  The subject of liquid democracy came up often, culminating in the question, ""What will the role of politicians be?"". One commentator remarked on the irony of a disruptive technology that, rather than generating chaos, adds stability.  The opinion was ventured that it's not so much about creating new regulation as about adapting existing regulation to new terminology. And concern was expressed about the consequences of something going wrong with the technological base of a new paradigm.  In a wide-ranging keynote speech, technologist Vinay Gupta called on the EU to ""pick up the pace"", and outlined a framework to understand the difficulties in regulating software. In short, according to Gupta, you can't. Software is ""regulated for what it does"", he said.  In conversation with CoinDesk, MEP Eva Kaili repeated this sentiment:  ""We can’t legislate the technology, but we can legislate the uses.""  In her closing remarks, Claire Bury, deputy director general of the European Commission's Directorate General for Communications Networks, Content & Technology, cited ethereum as ""one of the more sophisticated applications"".  She went on to highlight the technology's challenges, quoting developer Vlad Zamfir's recent tweet that ""ethereum isn't safe or scalable"".  The surprising mention of the smart contract platform by a regulator was echoed in the results of an audience poll. In response to the question: ""What should regulation focus on?"", the most popular answer, displayed in full color on a screen above was ""ethereum"".  Long road  As for next steps, the Blockchain Observatory will continue to engage industry representatives to get a feel for where to focus their regulatory efforts. The sense of urgency was palpable, but seemed to stem more from intense interest than a conviction that it would be easy.  As von Weizsäcker pointed out, ""It's going to take a little bit longer than people anticipated.""  An important question, he emphasized, is what governments could do to help the development of digital technology. Von Weizsäcker ventured that this could be achieved by governments using that technology themselves.  He then suggested that an example could be an application that did two things: 1) put identities of companies or people on the blockchain, and 2) put money on the blockchain, speculating that private applications could be built on such an infrastructure.  Lastly, the subject of bitcoin as a new form of money was broached, as was the question of whether it – or something similar – would ever replace the fiat currencies we know today.  Von Weizsäcker was notably noncommittal on that front. He did, however, make an observation that cryptocurrency enthusiasts are familiar with, but that was unusual coming from a politician.  He stated:  ""What is a currency really? It's a ponzi game.""
