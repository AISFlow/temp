42421358,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnspZ,1677195650,"The SEC's Stablecoin Hammer, Courtesy Terraform Labs and Do Kwon","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Terraform Labs and Do Kwon last week, alleging the terraUSD stablecoin was a security, alongside various other tokens and products. This feels pretty important.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Stablecoins as Securities (Again)  The narrative  Yeah, I had this exact same subheading last week. But look, some things have changed. Specifically, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has now sued Terraform Labs and co-founder/former CEO Do Kwon on allegations of fraud, selling unregistered securities and other related claims.  Why it matters  Last week I wrote about the SEC potentially calling a stablecoin a security. The SEC hasn’t actually alleged so in a court filing yet – it’s only said it thinks Binance USD is a security in a Wells Notice to Paxos. In suing Terraform, the SEC is actually alleging that terraUSD (UST) is a security, alongside basically every other token issued by Terraform Labs.  Breaking it down  The SEC sparked outrage within the crypto community in September 2021 by subpoenaing an at-the-time unnamed individual while at Messari’s Mainnet conference. Though he initially denied receiving the subpoena, Do Kwon later admitted he had been the one to receive the subpoena when he sued the SEC over allegations of violating the Administrative Procedures Act and due process (the case was voluntarily dismissed last year). The SEC’s interest appeared to be in the Mirror Protocol (which had MIR tokens on top of it), which helped create mirrored assets (mAssets), basically tokens pegged to the price of stocks.  Mirror had a rough few months in there, facing multiple multimillion-dollar exploits through 2022.  The SEC’s investigation appeared to, well, die down for a while. And of course, Terraform itself had a pretty lousy 2022.  Last Thursday, the SEC sued Terraform and Kwon, whose current whereabouts are a mystery.  According to the filing, the SEC is alleging the defendants sold unregistered “crypto asset securities” and securities-based swaps (the aforementioned mAssets). There's also quite a bit of fraud alleged. The biggest issue may be the claim that UST’s price was not at all stabilized by the LUNA mechanism; rather, the price was artificially maintained by means of an undisclosed firm (apparently Jump Trading) buying a large amount of UST in exchange for discounted LUNA.  Another really interesting aspect of the filing is how thorough the SEC was in explaining its reasoning. The SEC alleged that LUNA, wrapped LUNA, UST, MIR and mAssets were all securities, providing a detailed Howey analysis for the first four types of tokens and explaining how the last one was a securities-based swap.  It wasn’t just Howey, though – as attorneys Collins Belton and Gabriel Shapiro both pointed out, the SEC also used other analyses to allege that things like wrapped LUNA are a security, potentially bolstering its case in case this sets precedent.  So we have the SEC alleging that a (specific) stablecoin is a security, that an ecosystem token tied to the stablecoin is a security, that these other tokens are also securities and doing so with defendants that the industry will be hard-pressed to defend (you know, cause of all the alleged fraud and the whole collapse last year).  If the SEC wins this suit, it’ll have a court ruling affirming its oversight over a certain type of stablecoin and related ecosystem tokens. And while it’s true that generally rulings aren’t necessarily seen as a legal precedent unless at least an appeals court affirm them, we’re seeing district court rulings cited as precedent in all sorts of crypto-related cases right now.  My colleague Jesse Hamilton analyzed the SEC’s recent actions, writing that the SEC’s “shadow rules” are increasingly coming into view with the various lawsuits and settlements. This Terraform Labs suit feels like a very strong contender for having a lasting impact.

The trip makes a lot of sense – and not just because lawmakers’ recess dates from both Washington, D.C., and Brussels happened to align this week.  The European Union is right now putting the finishing touches to its Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) and transfer of funds regulations, which set out disclosure rules for crypto issuers, reserve requirements for stablecoins, and customer identification rules to tackle money laundering.  Senior Brussels officials are pretty proud of being the first major jurisdiction to regulate the sector, but they worry there’s no point unless other places follow suit. U.S. lawmakers, meanwhile, may feel they can learn something from Europe’s experience on thorny issues like how to regulate coins that don’t have a single centralized issuer, or crypto assets whose characteristics or purpose change over time.  The U.S. delegation appears to be a who’s who of D.C.-based crypto policy experts. A roster seen by CoinDesk includes over a dozen bipartisan staffers for banking and agriculture committees in both Senate and House, plus staffers for lawmakers including Senators Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Kyrsten Sinema (I-Ariz.) – all implicated in recent high-profile legislation for the sector.  Sources briefed on the visit told CoinDesk they’re meeting Brussels-based officials from the European Commission and European Parliament, as well as industry body Blockchain for Europe. That’ll be followed by a side trip to nearby Paris, where they’ll talk to officials from the EBA and ESMA, the European Union agencies for banking and securities markets who now need to set out some of MiCA’s finer details.  An EU official, who asked not to be named to speak candidly, told CoinDesk they “hope to inform our counterparts in [the] U.S. Congress about how the EU operates, what motivated us to propose MiCA, and what the substantive requirements and policy choices that were made in the MiCA negotiations are,” calling for greater coordination of an international ecosystem.  Industry representatives, too, hope Washington will at least partly copy Brussels’ example, and put in place a sensible and discerning crypto framework, rather than relying on occasional and sometimes unpredictable enforcement crackdowns like the Securities and Exchange Commission’s recent move against Kraken.  “I hope they are taking notes,” Ava Labs’ General Counsel Lee Schneider told CoinDesk. “I wish there was more regulation, instead of enforcement actions.”  This Week  Tuesday  15:00 UTC (10:00 a.m. ET): BlockFi bankruptcy hearing  Wednesday  15:00 UTC (10:00 a.m. ET) Voyager bankruptcy hearing  16:00 UTC (11:00 a.m. ET) Genesis bankruptcy hearing  19:00 UTC (2:00 p.m. ET) Fed minutes  Friday  15:30 UTC (10:30 a.m. ET) Mango Labs v.

The competition is still fierce in this industry. I believe MARA could have put in a significant long-term bottom. Thesis Summary Marathon Digital ( MARA ) is one of the largest Bitcoin (BTC-USD) miners in North America. The company recently reported its latest results and showed some encouraging production numbers in the last month. The price of MARA is strongly correlated to that of Bitcoin, and the stock price has shown it can produce gains above and beyond Bitcoin’s appreciation. Technical analysis suggests we could reach a top in the next cycle of over $200. Overview Marathon has a simple enough business model. Buy mining hardware and mine Bitcoin. Their revenue is the value of the Bitcoin they mine. This is determined by how many Bitcoins they can mine, which depends on their hash rate, and the dollar price of Bitcoin. On the cost side, we have energy and depreciation as the two main ones. However, there is also G&A and other expenses. Here’s the most recent income statement: MARA revenues (Earnings Release) As we can see above, the company has not managed to break even yet. Even at the height of Bitcoin’s price. This affects not only their income, but also the value of their balance sheet, which is mostly made up of Bitcoin. BTC on Balance sheet (Earnings release) The question moving forward is how Marathon can perform. First off, will they be able to carry out their ambitious expansion plan, and what are the possible risks? Strength and Opportunities MARA has ambitious plans to expand in 2023: MARA earnings release (earnings release) The company projects it can reach 23 EH/s by the middle of 2023. This will be achieved through an “asset-light” model. MARA earnings release (Earnings Release) Basically, the company intends to focus on acquiring top-tier miners, and relying on partnerships in order to find the best hosting, energy and real estate available. Indeed, this gives Marathon maneuverability but also opens the door to other risks. So far this year, the company has executed well, posting a solid 45% MoM increase in its BTC production. MARA hash rate (Earnings release) To sum up, Marathon’s strengths come from its large Bitcoin holdings, its asset light model, and also the fact that over the crypto winter, other big mining companies have capitulated, such as Core Scientific, lowering competition and freeing up resources. Weaknesses and Threats First, despite its advantages, the asset-light model also has drawbacks. Marathon is giving up control over important factors, and though this can be mitigated by having good partnerships, there’s always risk involved. For example, a few months ago, one of Marathon’s main hosting providers filed for bankruptcy. Another added risk factor for Marathon is its large debt load, especially when compared to its light assets and equity. The current debt-to-equity ratio is over 125%. This is especially significant as we enter a prolonged period of higher interest rates. Another issue for Marathon and the mining sector as a whole, is the increased competitive landscape if we look at Bitcoin’s hash rate. BTC hashrate (coinwarz) Even at weaker prices, BTC’s hash rate has continued to make all-time highs, showing just how much interest there is in Bitcoin mining. Technical Analysis As of right now, all options are on the table. Marathon TA (Author's work) Ideally, I would have liked to see Marathon attempt to reach the 61.8% retracement of the large wave 1, which is at around $2,5. However, we've seen a strong impulse take hold, and the possibility of a 1-2 to begin this larger degree wave 3 is now on the table. We are now retracing in wave 2, and if we can break above the recent wave 1 high, that’s strong evidence that a bottom could be in. However, the real test will be the $10-$12 area, where we have some strong resistance. For now, I am adding some Marathon to the stock portfolio, but leaving some cash with the hopes of doubling down at new lows or once I am more confident in the bull market. Takeaway Marathon will do well if Bitcoin does well, and it should be able to amplify returns of Bitcoin like it did in the last cycle. However, a business always carries more risks than just owning Bitcoin, so invest at your own risk.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4581427-marathon-tides-may-be-changing?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/9854588.jpeg

The Board’s rules permit an applicant to request that the Board reconsider its application decision,"" Thursday's release said, though it did not share much information beyond that.

42421352,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnsiL,1677192453,DAOs Don't Have to Be Completely Decentralized,"Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) are emerging as a new tool for organizing, managing and scaling Web3 projects.  This article is part of CoinDesk’s “BUIDL Week.” James Young is the co-founder of Abridged, the makers of Collab.Land.  Broadly speaking, the value of DAOs is rooted in the idea of the “global village,” i.e., the capacity to coordinate trustlessly at a global scale. At the highest level, we see three types of DAOs emerging in today’s landscape:  Capital allocation DAOs bring groups of people together to provide liquidity, vote on the allocation of that liquidity and (ideally) distribute rewards back to the community.  Social DAOs are typically organized around a token and promise companionship, networking, learning and collaboration for the community.  Governance DAOs are typically organized around major financial applications in which token ownership automatically grants “membership” (i.e., voting rights) in the DAO and the right to influence the direction of the protocol.  Baked into the name itself, many DAOs position themselves as decentralized – or at least plan to become completely decentralized. However, just because the technology underlying a DAO is decentralized doesn’t mean the organizational structure of a DAO should be as well.  In this hyper-prioritization of complete decentralization, many DAOs are, in fact, “DAOing” it wrong.  Decentralization is the starting point  Traditional organizations are limited in their ability to effectively distribute leadership. The concentration of power and lack of transparency limits innovation, creativity and diversity of thought.  In contrast, DAOs have the capacity to leverage decentralized networks and distribute leadership openly, dynamically and quickly as needs emerge. Members who make significant contributions to the organization are rewarded with influence and voting power, leading to a flexible system of leadership that scales as the organization does.  This model scales leadership, but it does not necessarily decentralize it completely.  Many DAOs say that decentralization, broadly, is the end goal and, as a result, conflates “system decentralization” with “organizational decentralization.” The former refers to the technological systems DAOs are built on and use, and the latter would include the DAO’s social and cultural attributes. System decentralization should be relentlessly pursued while organizational decentralization should be approached with caution.  Organizational decentralization at the wrong time or for the wrong DAO risks miring an organization in chaos and inefficiency — hampering innovation similar to centralized entities.  Rather than decentralizing organization for the sake of decentralization, DAOs should ensure the decentralized architecture of their token and voting enables efficient decision making and scalable leadership. It requires a revision in mindset — decentralization as the starting point, not the end goal.  DAOing it right  In the DAO landscape today there are already examples of how to organize and operate DAOs efficiently. We’re seeing a number of emerging “best practices” that demonstrate just how powerful decentralized technology can be when applied towards efficient management and scaled leadership.  Progressive decentralization is the process of rolling out more and more decision-making power to the community over time, ensuring oversight can still remain with key contributors in critical phases of early growth.  Organizations like Tribute Labs have pioneered legal clarity around DAOs, helping provide pathways forward for DAOs to be built off of decentralized technology with the benefits of traditional organizations.  See also: Developer Activity Shows Healthy Growth of the Crypto Space / BUIDL Week  Innovations in voting like the strong token delegation seen at Ethereum Naming Service and quadratic voting employed by Gitcoin have empowered communities to be more nuanced with their governance. The reality is complete organizational decentralization isn’t always the most effective path forward.  Meanwhile, the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) is already affecting how some DAOs make or inform decisions. Developers will use AI to help DAOs make better and faster decisions by analyzing data, identifying patterns and making predictions. Since DAOs are online native organizations with the entire governance process tracked on-chain, interactions can be programmatically analyzed.  Hierarchy rules  Companies move fastest with firm, recognizable leadership but companies last longest with a thriving community, engaged contributors and expansive opportunity. DAOs provide the opportunity for both: Decentralized technology can still be overseen by defined hierarchies while also providing permissionless opportunity for others to contribute, grow and scale.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,James Young,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/02/23/daos-dont-have-to-be-completely-decentralized,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/055b23d8a922dccdd6650ac29af32ee720bf15c7-1024x576.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42421364,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnu73,1677192114,What the Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade Will Mean for ETH Liquidity,"One of the most significant events for the Ethereum blockchain is likely to be the Shanghai upgrade. Currently planned for the first half of 2023, the Shanghai upgrade will implement a number of improvements to Ethereum. Chief among them is the ability for ether (ETH) stakers to withdraw both their staked coins and accrued rewards.  Users have helped to validate transactions on the so-called Beacon Chain since December 2020, when the proof-of-stake network launched. But so far staking has been a one-way trip: Funds were locked in the deposit contract while Ethereum developers built out the network in real time.  This article is part of CoinDesk’s “BUIDL Week.”Kevin de Patoul is the co-founder and CEO of Keyrock.  Protocols such as Lido, Rocketpool and StakeWise have begun offering “liquid staking” minted tokens to fill the gap. These tokens represent staked ETH but fluctuate in price, and can be used across the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. It remains to be seen how the upcoming Shanghai upgrade – which may precede a flood of ETH tokens into the market, by enabling new and existing stakers to withdraw – will affect these protocols that dominate liquid staking today.  Overall, this upcoming upgrade has the ability to increase the popularity of ETH staking. It will drive competition between staking protocols to users’ benefit, while also improving the security of Ethereum’s new PoS chain.  Bullish signals  It’s easy to think that launching Shanghai in the middle of a bear market could hurt the staking ecosystem. Stakers, skittish about the macro outlook of crypto in 2023, may choose to withdraw their ETH, keeping their assets liquid in case of more market turmoil. Cautious of regulatory movements against staking providers, new stakers may not rush to deposit funds the same as during the frenzy of a bull market.  In the long run, however, Shanghai (specifically, the ability to unstake and withdraw rewards) is bullish for Ethereum. Specifically, Shanghai will increase incentives for ETH liquidity providers in three main ways.  Spurring innovation  First, Shanghai will spur more innovation in direct staking and liquid staking solutions. The ability to stake, withdraw and restake ETH rewards with more frequency will engender more nuanced financial applications as people explore opportunities to maximize yield while minimizing risk. We will see heavy innovation in staking derivatives, and likely see more complex lending solutions to provide people access to ETH staking.  Shanghai also will be a boon for individual liquidity providers on liquid staking platforms. The ability for people to redeem their wrapped staked ETH for underlying staked ETH will force liquid staking platforms to become even more user friendly. We will see more features and incentives emerge as these liquid staking protocols fight for liquidity providers in a world where staked ETH is suddenly liquid.  Strengthening ETH  Second, Shanghai will strengthen ETH’s position as the blueprint for staking protocols. The yield that Ethereum pays following Shanghai – which is a matter of network liquidity and transaction volumes – will emerge as a kind of “base yield” for crypto. Newer and existing staking protocols will have to compete with Ethereum's yield mechanism, likely making the asset class more secure, reliable and predictable – and less risky.  Sovereign assets  Third, Shanghai will give ETH liquidity providers simple yet powerful emotional security. In crypto the guiding principle is sovereignty over your assets. Contracts that require locking funds are a tough pill to swallow, even for those who deeply believe in Ethereum. With Shanghai, the emotional barrier to participation is lifted and liquidity providers will more confidently commit their stake.  See also: Unlike Merge, Ethereum's Shanghai Upgrade Could Bring Ether Price Volatility  Altogether, the Shanghai upgrade will kick-start another cycle of innovation focused on ETH staking. Liquidity providers will be the tangible benefactors of this innovation, accessing a growing ecosystem of features, tools and service providers. The end result is a more decentralized ecosystem of contributors and a more secure network.  Points of centralization  There is one main consideration we should keep in mind after Shanghai goes live – staking centralization. On the surface, an increase in ETH staking means an increase in network “decentralization.” However, if the majority of new stakers after Shanghai elect to stake through a provider like crypto exchange Coinbase, then we run the risk of seeing a few centralized and on-chain providers dominate the ecosystem.  With this consideration in mind, what we hope to see is enough innovation in the staking industry that decentralization increases in the long run. More competition means more choice, which could drive protocols to differentiate themselves with better products and consumer offerings. Moreover, organizations such as the Ethereum Foundation should focus on the UX [user experience] of single stakers to incentivize a more resilient staking network.  Transition transmission  There are many more upgrades planned for Ethereum in the future.

42393840,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brQxIf,1677190377,"Crypto Markets Analysis: Bitcoin, Ether Trade Sideways as Jobs Data Remains Robust","Crypto markets were trading mostly sideways, with some major tokens up a little but others falling slightly after the latest jobs data showed labor markets remaining stubbornly tight.  Initial jobless claims for the week ending Feb. 18 fell by 3,000 to 192,000 but arrived below the consensus estimate of 200,000. Strong jobs data has been thorny for the U.S. Federal Reserve in its efforts to reduce inflation rates from 6.4% to its target rate of 2%.  Strong jobs data, which is generally an economic boom, has counterintuitively weighed against asset prices because a strong employment environment leads to higher prices as organizations ratchet up wages to recruit and retain scarce talent.  Yet, bitcoin and ether shrugged off the latest reading to trade 0.50% and 0.40% higher, respectively, during the 13:00 UTC (8 a.m. ET) hour of release. Selling pressure increased throughout the remainder of the day on average volume, although both BTC and ETH recently remained in the green.  Other relevant economic data on Thursday showed that U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an estimated 2.7% in the second quarter, versus expectations for 2.9% growth.  Personal consumption expenditures (PCE) declined from 4.3% last month to 3.7%, above the consensus estimate of a 3.9% increase. This data point underscores that while inflationary pressures has moderated, it remains elevated.  The minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) latest meeting earlier this month, released on Wednesday, emphasized the same with more than 10 separate references to either inflation or wage growth as “elevated.” Crypto markets will continue to scrutinize the Federal Reserve governors’ evolving inflation prescriptions, particularly if price increases fall outside expectations.  Currently, the CME FedWatch tool is assigning a 75% probability to the FOMC boosting interest rates by 25 basis points during the upcoming March 22 meeting. A week prior, the probability was 85%, indicating that the likelihood of a more aggressive 50 basis point hike has increased.  Fed meeting minutes indicate that “a few participants” favored raising the federal funds rate by 50 basis points at the prior meeting. The more aggressive hike would “more quickly” bring the target rate to levels facilitating price stability.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/02/23/crypto-markets-analysis-bitcoin-ether-trade-sideways-as-jobs-data-remains-robust,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/48ee9afef8bcdd7c1b3939b686482ba8954418a1-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42410814,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggrtAe,1677190337,"Dapper Labs Ruling Could Spell Trouble for Other Centralized NFT Projects, Experts Say","A recent legal decision may offer some much-needed – though not much-liked – clarity on the regulatory landscape ahead for non-fungible tokens (NFT) that may define how centralized companies proceed in entering Web3.  The federal judge in New York overseeing a class-action lawsuit against Dapper Labs ruled Wednesday to deny the company’s motion to dismiss the suit, writing that the plaintiffs’ claims that Dapper Labs’ NBA-branded Top Shot Moments NFTs are securities – and that selling them without first registering with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was a violation of federal securities laws – are “plausible.”  In his 64-page Wednesday ruling, U.S. District Court Judge Victor Marrero of the Southern District of New York considered Dapper Labs’ NFT collection under the four prongs of the Howey test, a 90-year-old method devised by the U.S. Supreme Court to determine whether certain transactions qualify as “investment contracts.”  Marrero stated that the plaintiffs adequately argued that the Top Shot NFTs met each of the four prongs of the Howey Test. The fourth prong – that the profits expected from an investment must be derived from the efforts of others – was particularly important to Marrero’s analysis.  Because Dapper Labs controls the Flow blockchain the NFT collection is built on as well as the marketplace where the NFTs are bought and sold, Marrero suggested that the financial viability of the project was dependent on Dapper Labs’ continued success.  “All that Moments purchasers own is, essentially, the line of code recorded on the Flow Blockchain,” Marrero wrote. “It follows that, if, hypothetically, Dapper Labs went out of business and shut down the Flow Blockchain, the value of all Moments would drop to zero.”  Though Dapper Labs attempted to argue in its motion to dismiss that the NFTs were the digital equivalent of any other cardboard-based collectible, like Pokemon cards or baseball cards, Marrero fundamentally disagreed.  “It is the particular scheme by which Dapper Labs offers Moments that creates the sufficient legal relationship between investor and promoter to establish an investment contract, and thus a security, under Howey,” Marrero concluded.  An influential ruling  Though Marrero’s ruling is, by his own admission, “narrow” (meaning it does not necessarily mean that other NFTs are securities), and is neither final nor sets precedent, legal experts agree that it is significant – both for Dapper Labs and the broader NFT space.  Anthony Sabino, a professor of law at St. John’s University, told CoinDesk that Marrero’s opinion that Dapper Labs’ NFTs meet the definition of securities “may not necessarily be precedential, but it shall be quite influential because it emanates from the Southern District [of New York], because it's from an eminent jurist and because it just makes a lot of sense.”  “The judges in the Southern District of New York are particularly adept at securities cases, for the reason that they are within walking distance of Wall Street itself,” Sabino said. “They have their finger on the pulse of Wall Street. They see these cases all the time.”  Sabino added that the Southern District of New York reports to the federal Second Circuit Court of Appeals, which he said has been acknowledged by the U.S. Supreme Court since the 1970s as the “mother court” of federal securities laws.  Other lawyers, however, such as Jesse Hynes, a New Jersey-based attorney whose practice includes cryptocurrency law, see less reason to believe Marrero’s analysis spells disaster for either Dapper Labs or the wider NFT space.  Motions to dismiss, Hynes explained, are common – and usually unsuccessful – attempts to stop lawsuits before they get to trial.  “Attorneys will throw up a ‘Hail Mary’ of sorts [to end the litigation],” Hynes told CoinDesk. “Or, in keeping with the basketball analogy – a full court shot with their eyes closed.”  Hynes told CoinDesk that as long as the plaintiffs’ claim was deemed to be “reasonably feasible,” the complaint was determined to proceed to the next stage of litigation.  An issue of centralization  Whether or not Marrero’s ruling sets precedent or not, legal experts agree other judges will hardly be the only people to take note of his analysis – particularly his insinuation that it was Dapper Labs’ creation and control of the Flow blockchain and the marketplace that brought the Top Shots NFTs under the Howey Test’s prongs.  “This case is all about centralization and external dependencies,” said Mike Selig, a New York-based cryptocurrency attorney at Willkie Farr & Gallagher. “The plaintiffs argue that the NFTs are distinguishable from physical basketball trading cards because Dapper [Labs] maintains the blockchain on which the NFTs operate, runs the secondary marketplace where the NFTs trade and engages in the ongoing marketing of the NFTs to consumers.”  Moish Peltz, a New York-based partner at Falcon Rappaport & Berkman whose practice focuses on cryptocurrencies and intellectual property, told CoinDesk that it was “ironic” that Dapper Labs’ decision to build on top of the Flow blockchain “in a specific attempt to create a better consumer experience was seized on by the Court.”  “Since Moments live exclusively on the Flow blockchain, the [National Basketball Association] was trying to solve for many of the financial, intellectual property and regulatory issues that have plagued brand owners on public blockchains,” Peltz said. “This decision directly challenges the rationale that a centralized NFT marketplace experience is automatically safer for brands.”  Though Marrero construed his own decision as “narrow” and argued that “not all NFTs offered or sold by any company will constitute a security,” Peltz said his decision should push brands to “more deeply consider the relative merits of whether to build customized experiences under their exclusive control on centralized blockchains, versus deploying on public blockchains.”  Jeremy Goldman, an intellectual property (IP) lawyer and partner at law firm Frankfurt Kurnit Klein & Selz, told CoinDesk the ruling might be good news for NFT projects building on public blockchains.  “Folks minting NFTs on public blockchains and using open marketplaces can breathe a little easier,” Goldman said. “The vast majority of NFT projects don’t share those key facts that troubled the court.”  He noted that Dapper’s strategy in creating a “walled garden” within its platform is what contributed to the ruling, providing future guidance on how to create NFT platforms and products.  “As with most blockchain ventures, the more centralized the NFT offering, the greater the risk that the offering will be deemed a security,” said Goldman. “My hope is that the Dapper Labs decision helps educate courts, lawmakers and regulators on the fundamental distinction between private and public blockchains; between centralized platforms and decentralized protocols.”  Is decentralization the solution?  “This case demonstrates that decentralization is just as important in the case of NFTs as with fungible tokens,” Selig told CoinDesk.  Sabino, the law professor, agreed. He argued that if Dapper Labs was more decentralized, it could have possibly avoided triggering Howey.  Because Dapper Labs’ controlled the marketplace where its NFTs were sold, Sabino argued, the role of investors was diminished.  “That way, the purchasers become true investors, passive in nature, and therefore makes it a security subject to federal securities laws,” Sabino said. “To the extent that there is decentralization and the purchasers are far more active and they’re far less reliant on the ‘efforts of others,’ then it becomes less likely that the NFT falls within Howey.”  However, not all legal experts are hopeful that decentralization would offer any protection for NFT projects.  “I just don’t think that the argument of something being centralized or not being centralized would be sufficient to beat this case,” said Max Dilendorf, a New York-based cryptocurrency attorney, told CoinDesk, pointing to a 2018 case the SEC brought against decentralized trading platform EtherDelta.  In the EtherDelta case, Dilendorf said, ”the [SEC] said, ‘Hey, you know, we don’t really care if you’re decentralized or not, it’s irrelevant. You launched something that was illegal, the exchange was operated as an unregistered securities exchange, so you, as the founder, are liable.”  “I think it’s just so incredibly difficult to make an argument that any blockchain project is decentralized. It’s impossible, right?” Dilendorf said. “I don’t think anyone would be able to rely on that.”  Some NFT companies appear unbothered  While lawyers might be nervous about the implications of Marrero’s ruling, major players in the NFT space are thus far unfazed by the implications the case may have on their future operations. In other words, they are confident in the belief that NFTs are not securities.  “Courts have repeatedly found that consumer goods – including art and collectibles like basketball cards – are not securities under federal law,” a representative from Dapper Labs told CoinDesk. “We are confident the same holds true for Moments and other collectibles, digital or otherwise, and look forward to vigorously defending our position in court as the case continues.”  Josh Rosenblatt, chief operating officer and general counsel of Co:Create, a company that helps NFT projects launch their own cryptocurrencies, told CoinDesk that in regards to regulation the Dapper Labs case is “not an important ruling,” and that the case will set no precedent for the future of NFTs being classified as securities.  “Ultimately, if a token, whether fungible or non-fungible, were deemed a security, then the issuer would either need to register with the SEC or take advantage of an exemption from registration,” said Rosenblatt. “I think the crypto community will eagerly watch from the sidelines, and I personally would be shocked if the ruling ultimately went against Top Shot.”  Rosenblatt specified that while the risk of regulators deeming NFTs as securities is low, fractionalized NFTs – or NFTs that represent shared ownership of one token – are more likely to fall into this category.  Sanjay Raghavan, head of Web3 initiatives at blockchain real-estate company Roofstock onChain, told CoinDesk that the specificity of Dapper Labs’ scheme to create a private blockchain and marketplace may render its NFTs as securities, but applying the same ruling to all NFTs would be a “broad overreach” of the Howey Test.  “There are many NFT projects running on public blockchains with high consumptive value and associated IP rights that don’t necessarily meet the prongs of the Howey Test,” said Raghavan. “Whether it’s staking-as-a-service, stablecoin yield programs or NFTs on private blockchains, it is possible to look at the hundreds of appellate cases to determine what constitutes an investment contract and what likely does not.”  Looking ahead  While the NFT regulatory landscape is still relatively new territory for both creators and collectors, the Dapper Labs ruling may not be promising for the future of a tokenized economy.  It’s especially difficult for Web3 companies that rely on centralized entities to help connect consumers and brands, which serves as the ethos behind many of these projects. As mainstream brands such as Nike and Starbucks take their first steps into NFTs, the Dapper Labs ruling may serve as a warning sign for centralized companies tapping into Web3.  A representative from secondary NFT marketplace OpenSea told CoinDesk that classifying all NFTs as securities isn’t plausible due to tokens’ varied utility. While the underlying technology may be adjacent, their use cases such as gaming, art, ticketing and digital identity all merit different levels of regulatory scrutiny.  While regulators may continue to use the Howey Test prongs on projects that pose the risk of being classified as securities, Goldman believes the ruling is a significant step in providing regulatory clarity for all NFT projects spanning the space, whether public or private.  “Right or wrong, the decision provides some of the best legal guidance I’ve seen – basically a road map – on how to structure NFT projects in a way that minimizes securities risks,” said Goldman.

42412759,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl6HJk,1677190243,Montana Senate Passes Bill Protecting Crypto Miners,"The Montana State Senate passed a bill on Thursday protecting crypto miners from a range of possible actions against the industry.  The proposed law passed 37-13 in the Senate and next will go the state's House for its approval. The bill protects at-home mining, prevents discriminatory utility rates for miners and stipulates that crypto used as payment will not be subject to additional taxes.  The legislation also takes power from local governments, preventing them from moving against at-home mining or retroactively using zoning laws to shut down active operations. ""These protections, along with clarifying tax law in relation to digital assets when used as payment, will plant a flag in Montana that sends a message that we are open to embracing the digital asset mining industry,"" Montana Senator Daniel Zolnikov (R) told CoinDesk.  The new law might possibly upend a 2020 Missoula County zoning ordinance that required all bitcoin miners to buy or build renewable energy assets equivalent to their energy consumption.  ""Missoula County has no position on this bill, and we're not concerned it will affect our regulations,"" said a representative for the county.  Bitcoin miners have been targeted by environmentalists and U.S. lawmakers for their potential impacts on carbon neutrality goals as well as electrical grids. In the past few months, bitcoin miners have been fighting back; as many as five bills are going through state legislatures to protect the industry.  Bitcoin advocacy group Satoshi Action Fund helped draft the language in the bill. ""There is still more work to be done in Montana, but as a new organization we feel confident about the progress we have made,"" said Dennis Porter, CEO and co-founder of Satoshi Action Fund.

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was trading at 23,921, a 0.5% gain from Wednesday, same time but down from its weekly high of over $25,000, according to CoinDesk data. Crypto markets have been struggling to gain traction amid ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty.  “The market has not been able to kind of get over that hump,” Joel Kruger, market strategist at LMAX Group, told CoinDesk in an interview.  “Until we do that, I think there continues to be the risk that it's possible that we're still in this big consolidation off of that downtrend that we saw,” he said.  Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, was up 2.1% to recently trade at $1,650. The CoinDesk Market Index, which measures overall crypto market performance, was up 1.1% for the day.  Equities markets edged higher, with the S&P 500 index recently up 0.5% after a four-day sell-off.  Wednesday's FOMC minutes release offered monetary doves and hawks alike some hope, although the heavy likelihood of a 25 basis point rate hike was unchanged.  The CME FedWatch Tool shows that less than three in four traders currently foresee a 25 basis-point hike, while over one in four expect a 50 basis-point hike at the FOMC’s next meeting in March.  In an email to CoinDesk, Bob Ras, co-founder of exchange and digital asset ecosystem Sologenic, wrote that while the central bank’s continued monetary tightening could dampen the crypto market’s performance, Asian central banks, including Japan and China, have been injecting liquidity into their respective markets, suggesting the recent rally ""still has legs.""  “The amount of quantitative easing in Japan alone has been truly astronomical – so much so that this form of yield curve control has all but negated the tightening performed by the Fed over the last year,” Ras wrote, adding that “bitcoin and crypto are particularly sensitive to these kinds of fluctuations” as the money supply abroad is expanding.

42393915,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brc4A7,1677181613,"Bitcoin’s Future Hinges on Donations, and That’s Got People Worried","Last month, Bitcoin developer James O'Beirne sounded the alarm: The dominant blockchain might lose some very talented contributors if someone doesn’t step up to pay them for their work.  That work involves writing and maintaining code for the Bitcoin blockchain, tasks completely dependent on grants and donations from businesses and voluntary contributors. But relying on grants, stipends and free labor makes Bitcoin development prone to the ebb and flow of crypto markets – and goodwill.  This story is part of CoinDesk’s “BUIDL Week.""  The price of bitcoin (BTC) is currently down by well over 60% since its all-time high in November 2021. Consequently, many Bitcoin businesses – the main source of those grants and stipends – have tightened their purse strings and some have even been forced into bankruptcy, leaving many in the community anxious about how Bitcoin developers will get paid in the future.  “It'd be really nice to see more Bitcoin businesses step up,” O'Beirne tweeted. “This could get bad.”  Steven Lee, who leads Spiral, a subsidiary of Jack Dorsey’s Block that focuses on funding Bitcoin development, isn’t as pessimistic and chalks up the gloomy funding situation to the current slump in crypto asset prices.  “You have to recognize that we're in the middle of a bear market,” Lee told CoinDesk in an interview. “Some companies and funders that were doing a really nice job of funding developers have had to reduce that due to financial pressures and the bear market.”  Adam Back, CEO and co-founder of Bitcoin infrastructure firm Blockstream, chimed in with a response to O'Beirne’s SOS and pointed out that the recent deluge of layoffs may have forced cash-strapped crypto exchanges to cut spending and opt out of renewing developer grants.  Read more: So You Want to Be a Bitcoin Developer?  What happens if funding dries up?  How bad could things get if the bear market persists, funding dries up and Bitcoin development grinds to a halt? What’s so critical about the work Bitcoin developers do?  Gloria Zhao is a “maintainer” for Bitcoin Core (or just “Core”) – the most popular software for connecting to the Bitcoin network. She approves updates to Core suggested by other developers and knows a thing or two about the project’s inner workings.  “Every software project requires maintenance,” Zhao explained in a podcast interview. “Up to 70% of software project activity is actually maintenance work, and I think … it’s more than that in Bitcoin Core.”  Many people only pay attention to big protocol upgrades like 2021’s Taproot, which improved Bitcoin’s privacy, scalability and security. Smaller incremental wins and ongoing maintenance don’t get as much recognition, but Zhao says that’s where most of the work is.  “The vast majority of changes are just, like, bug fixes,” Zhao explained. “And then a very small minority are maybe something like Taproot or something like Package Relay where you’re trying to make a protocol change.”  According to a report by New York Digital Investment Group (NYDIG), a Bitcoin-focused investment firm, the ongoing Core maintenance Zhao is referring to is carried out by roughly 40 to 60 active developers every month. Zoom out to include the broader Bitcoin ecosystem, and that number jumps to anywhere from 600 to 1,000 developers per month. That’s essentially how many Bitcoin developers require funding on a monthly basis.  Many crypto projects go bust because of fraud, malicious hacks, or even regulatory pressure; FTX, Ronin Network, Tornado Cash are a few examples. Not as many make headlines for shutting down due to funding issues.  One cautionary tale is the Cardano decentralized finance (DeFi) project Ardana.  Ardana raised $10 million in 2021 to work on stablecoin minting and foreign exchange services. After a year of attempting to become “the MakerDAO and the Curve Finance of Cardano,” the project was forced to call it quits, citing “funding and project timeline uncertainty.”  While Ardana and Bitcoin are two completely different animals, Ardana’s demise serves as a stark reminder of what can happen when project funding runs out.  Lee doesn’t believe Bitcoin, even in the most dire funding situation, will ever go completely bust.  “Even in the worst-case scenario, there's still several organizations that fund Bitcoin development,” Lee explained. “As far as I know, they're not in a situation where the budgets can disappear, and that includes Spiral and also includes Chaincode Labs and Brink.”  A recent report by crypto venture firm Electric Capital supports Lee’s perspective. Despite a bloodbath in the crypto markets, the number of full-time developers in the general blockchain ecosystem grew by 8% to an all-time high of 61,000 developers in 2022. The data is even more impressive when reviewed over a five-year period: The number of monthly active developers in the Bitcoin ecosystem has tripled since 2018 and stands at roughly 1,000 active developers every month. Ethereum’s developer count has swelled five-fold to almost 6,000 contributors over the same timespan, according to the report.  Diversification  Spiral isn’t the only organization dedicated to funding development on crypto’s dominant chain. Brink was named the top funder of Core last year by crypto research firm BitMex Research.  Read more: Brink Emerges as the Top Funder of Bitcoin Core Development, BitMex Research Says  Chaincode Labs (a Bitcoin research center and O’Beirne’s previous employer), Blockstream and large crypto exchanges like Coinbase and OKCoin all have active grant programs for Bitcoin developers. The Human Rights Foundation is a well-known proponent of open-source cryptocurrencies and even runs a Bitcoin Development Fund. On Feb. 21, the organization doled out $475,000 in grants to 10 Bitcoin projects across the world.  This diversity of funding sources isn’t accidental. Spiral has a four-part framework for what it calls, “sustainable open-source Bitcoin development.” One aspect of that framework is “multi-entity funding,” which emphasizes the need to obtain funding from multiple sources.  “Since I've been in the space, I've referred to a 10-by-10 model. And by that I just mean it's healthy for Bitcoin development if there's 10 organizations funding 10 developers each,” Lee said. “And I don't mean that literally. It'd be great if there's 11 organizations versus 10, but there shouldn't be one dominant organization funding Bitcoin development.”  This concept seems counter to how the majority of blockchain networks approach funding. Most so-called decentralized networks are governed and funded by central foundations.  Ethereum, for example, was pre-mined via the second largest crowdsale on the Internet at the time and ongoing development is mostly funded by the Ethereum Foundation which held $1.6 billion in its coffers last year.  Bitcoin doesn’t have $1.6 billion lying around to fund development. A rough back-of- the-envelope calculation indicates $150 million to $200 million would be required every year to fund development in the entire Bitcoin ecosystem (assuming 1,000 developers receiving Google’s average $150,000 to $200,000 annual compensation for software engineers). Spiral’s total annual budget is in the neighborhood of $3 million, according to Lee.  The network’s lifeblood is the goodwill of its community, and that goodwill can come from organizations like Spiral or organically from entrepreneurs like Ryan Singer, who responded to O'Beirne's concerns by offering to hire one or two engineers for a Bitcoin project he’s working on.  Singer’s engineers would be allowed to devote 25% of their working time contributing to Bitcoin.  “It was intended to cover contributions to the Bitcoin Core GitHub repository,” Singer told CoinDesk. “But in talking to candidates, I'm expanding it to also include the three major Lightning node implementations.”",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Frederick Munawa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/02/23/can-bitcoin-afford-to-maintain-its-core-network-coindesk,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/79aaaa8fef2f20d66059b7f8f2d89c4b0540d521-2008x1130.gif?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42412769,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl6HSA,1677180576,"Kraken’s Head of OTC Options Trading: Investors Are Still Interested In Crypto, Staking","The fall of the FTX crypto exchange and the recent regulatory crackdown by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commision (SEC) hasn’t deterred institutional interest in crypto, said Kraken’s head of over-the-counter (OTC) options trading, Juthica Chou.  “What we’ve seen is that the trading interest remains really strong both for proof-of-work networks as well as proof-of-stake networks,” Chou said Thursday on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover.”  She said the crypto exchange is working with different clients “who are trying to gain directional exposure,” and who see that there are “possible assets with opportunities both for short- and long-term investments.”  Earlier this month, the SEC charged San Francisco-based Kraken with allegedly selling unregistered securities via its staking-as-a-service platform. The agency ordered Kraken to “immediately” close down its staking service to U.S. customers. Shortly after, Kraken’s two registered companies, Payward Ventures, Inc. and Paywayrd Trading Ltd., agreed to settle the $30 million fine issued by the SEC.  The move may stop Kraken’s U.S. based customers from participating in staking services, but according to Chou, staking more broadly is a “really interesting, important crypto native aspect” tied to new and emerging protocols, and one that she says “a lot of our institutional clients have an interest in.”  “We’ll definitely continue to see it around for a while,” she said, adding that there is also renewed interest from investors for bitcoin (BTC). Clients, she says, are paying close attention to opportunities that provide “natural leverage” and that “are more yield generating.”  That there is an uptick in institutional interest in digital assets was echoed by ETC Group’s Co-CEO Bradley Duke. He told “First Mover” Thursday that there is strong institutional confidence in crypto, adding that bitcoin is leading that effort.  Duke said that in January, bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETP) saw net inflows of about 11,301 BTC, the second-highest start at the beginning of any year since 2013.  “That’s a good indicator for us that these are players that are entering the space,” he said.

42421372,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnuEH,1677180071,Coinbase Joins the Ethereum Layer 2 Rat Race – Can It Grow?,"Coinbase (COIN) has big plans for its newly announced Ethereum scaling product. The project, Base, built in collaboration with layer 2 network Optimism on Optimism’s Massachusetts Institute of Technology-licensed OP Stack, aims to reduce ETH transaction fees to 1 cent, integrate with other blockchains like Solana, Avalanche and Polygon, and serve as a springboard for the company’s “Master Plan” to bring 1 billion people into crypto by “buying, building or investing” projects in the “open financial system.”  The announcement comes at a pivotal time for the largest U.S. crypto exchange. Coinbase’s most recent quarterly report showed a company in transition, with its core revenue stream of transaction volumes drying up amid the crypto winter. At the same time, it’s seeing growth in other potentially profitable business lines like staking and with other service fees. Base, a protocol Coinbase intends to “decentralize” over time, could become a moneymaker for the company that has long looked to diversify its balance sheet.  This article is part of ""BUIDL Week"" and was published in The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  According to TechCrunch, Base will initially charge fees in the 10- to 50-cent range – comparable with leading Ethereum layer 2 networks such as Arbitrum and Optimism. And, although still just a testnet, it doesn’t seem like Base will want for early adopters: Established projects including Chainlink, Etherscan, Aave, Animoca Brands, Dune, Nansen, Magic Eden and Wormhole, among others, have signaled support. This is big news considering “Coinbase has no plans to issue a new network token,” as CoinDesk’s Shaurya Malwa put it bluntly.  See also: Cathie Wood's ARK Buys Over $13M of Coinbase Shares  Coinbase's experiments  Coinbase has long taken a strategy of contributing technology and guidance to crypto, including targeting 10% of its cash holdings for venture opportunities. Not all of those experiments have fared well. For example, its non-fungible market (NFT) platform has struggled to gain market share since it launched last year, despite the company’s brand. Base will be released into an increasingly competitive and complex market of Ethereum scaling tools. On Tuesday, Arbitrum, a dominant layer 2 network, surpassed Ethereum in daily transactions.  Meanwhile, several rival projects are working on Ethereum-compatible “zero-knowledge rollups,” aka zkEVMs, promising to shake up the layer 2 landscape. Polygon and ConsenSys are just two of the major firms working on breakthrough ZK technologies, which differ from existing “optimistic” products like Arbitrum and Optimism by authenticating transactions instantaneously through “validity proofs.” (Arbitrum and Optimism assume transactions are valid during a weeklong dispute window before “rolling” a block onto the Ethereum mainchain – a system that could be abused.)  Base, which is intended to be integrated across Coinbase’s exchange, wallet and developer products, is a way to help guide existing users “to places they can go that aren’t controlled by Coin]base,” the project’s lead developer Jesse Pollak told TechCrunch. This is significant. Earlier this week Consensus Magazine published an op-ed by Łukasz Anwajler about the need for more secure “user journeys” across the crypto ecosystem. People need to stay in control of their funds from “on-chain to off-chain,” he said.  Indeed, there is a clear need for scaling products and further experimentation. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin’s “road map” for Ethereum looks more like a guide to the U.S. highway system, with forking and intertwining and paths, rather than MapQuest directions to a known location. But there is still a concern about how to incentivize lasting use of protocols. Other layer 2s have had the benefit of issuing tokens or implicitly promising a future airdrop to bring transactions on-chain – a path likely foreclosed to Coinbase, an exchange somewhat notable for not having a “native token,” amid the current regulatory regime.  See also: Optimism Token Up 6.5% as Coinbase Builds Its Layer 2 on the Platform  That, coupled with the growing awareness of the risks centralized entities bring into decentralized finance (DeFi), may play against Base’s growth. It’s now unknown how long Base was being planned or under development (Coinbase was the first exchange to launch a layer 2 network), but its introduction comes as Coinbase scales back. In recent months, Coinbase pulled out of India and other markets, and laid off hundreds of employees. If Base is a core area of growth, it isn’t clear Coinbase will have all the resources necessary to fully develop it.

The regulators noted that the stability of bank deposits by crypto firms does not rely solely on the company itself, but on market volatility and related vulnerabilities in the industry. ""Such deposits can be susceptible to large and rapid inflows as well as outflows, when end customers react to crypto market events, media reports, and uncertainty,"" the joint statement read. ""The resulting deposit volatility can be exacerbated by end customer confusion related to inaccurate or misleading representations of deposit insurance by a crypto-related entity."" The regulators also highlighted risks associated with deposits that constitute stablecoin-related reserves. ""Such deposits can be susceptible to large and rapid outflows stemming from, for example, unanticipated stablecoin redemptions or dislocations in crypto markets."" The agencies called on banks to actively monitor such liquidity risks and maintain effective risk management. They outlined management practices such as understanding susceptibility of deposits from crypto entities to volatility, assessing interconnectedness across such deposits, incorporating these risks into contingency funding planning, and performing robust due diligence.

The protocol also worked with crypto exchange Binance to confirm the exploiter’s identity. The hacker used a Binance account that went through know-your-customer checks for a withdrawal request. Platypus said it contacted law enforcement and filed a complaint in France.  The Platypus hack last week exploited a bug in the platform’s solvency check mechanism to steal $9.2 million of digital assets, leading to its native stablecoin USP yo lose its dollar peg.  The exploit consisted of three consecutive attacks, the post explained. The first and most severe drained a total of $8.5 million in stablecoins, including Circle’s USDC, Tether’s USDT, Maker’s DAI and Paxos’ binance USD from the protocol’s main pool.  Read more: How Solvency Check Error Led to USP Depegging on Avalanche-Based Platypus Finance  The protocol recovered $2.4 million of stolen USDC stablecoins with the help of blockchain security firm BlockSec. Additionally, Tether froze $1.5 million of stolen USDT, according to the post.  The second attack mistakenly transferred $380,000 of stablecoins to lending protocol Aave. Platypus has submitted a proposal to Aave’s governance forum for the release of those assets.  Some $287,000 worth of assets were stolen in the third attack. The protocol considered the funds unrecoverable and lost, as the exploiter ran the stolen assets through crypto mixer Tornado Cash and encryption service Aztec Network, according to the post.  In the blog post, the protocol said it hadn't used its $1.4 million treasury to compensate victims of the hack, but might do so over the next six months if Platypus cannot recover more assets.  “This compensation plan ensures that a minimum of 63% of the funds will be distributed to users, regardless of any further update on fund recovery,” the Platypus post said.  If Tether agrees to remint the frozen USDT to Platypus and Aave approves the recovery proposal, then 78% of user funds will be recovered.  Platypus said it aims to restart the stablecoin swap protocol next week, without its depegged stablecoin, USP.  The Platypus exploit is the latest example of crypto’s rampant problem with hackers. Last year, hackers stole $3.8 billion in crypto assets, primarily from DeFi platforms such as Platypus, according to a report by blockchain security firm Chainalysis.

42394494,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bw8LZV,1677174675,Bitcoin NFTs: What Are Ordinal NFTs and How Do You Mint One?,"Non-fungible tokens (NFT) are most widely known as Ethereum-based tokens, but lately the buzz is all about Bitcoin NFTs, which are also known as Ordinal NFTs or Bitcoin Ordinals.  The introduction of something called inscriptions on Bitcoin’s mainnet in January 2023 enabled the creation of Ordinal NFTs, which are basically NFTs on Bitcoin. The novel project has captured the collective mindshare of both NFT lovers and haters. CoinDesk’s coverage of Ordinals has ranged from how it has led to a resurgence in Bitcoin development, how it might have accidentally fixed Bitcoin’s security budget and how it can potentially lift the entire crypto ecosystem.  That’s high praise for a seemingly innocuous addition to Bitcoin. The news might have you wondering: How do these things work? How are Ordinal NFTs different from other NFTs? And of course: How can I get my own Ordinal NFT?  For this, look no further. We’ll explain it all in this article.  How do Ordinal NFTs work?  Ordinal NFTs use inscriptions to work. Inscriptions are powered by Ordinal theory through the Ordinal protocol, which was developed by Casey Rodarmor. Ordinal theory aims to give satoshis (the smallest unit of bitcoin at 1/100,000,000 of a full bitcoin) “individual identities allowing them to be tracked, transferred and imbued with meaning.”  Basically, the Ordinal protocol assigns each satoshi a sequential number. After that number is assigned, each satoshi can then be inscribed with data such as pictures, text or videos through a Bitcoin transaction. Once that transaction is mined, the arbitrary data is permanently part of the Bitcoin blockchain and viewable through Ordinal-enabled Bitcoin wallets and online Ordinal viewers.  How are they different from other NFTs?  The one main difference between Ordinal NFTs and other NFTs has to do with data storage.  Most NFTs are created using the Ethereum blockchain through the ERC-721 Non-Fungible Token Standard. ERC 721 is a standard which outlines how an NFT should be created so that it will be properly recognized across the Ethereum ecosystem. When an ERC-721 NFT is created, a file of metadata – literally data which provides information about other data (hence, “meta”) – provides information about the NFT. The easiest way to think of it is that the NFT itself is a contract that proves ownership of another item, which is detailed in that metadata. In the case of the most common NFTs, which are digital art, the actual JPG or file of the art is usually stored off the Ethereum blockchain and the metadata includes a link to that file. This means that the actual file or artwork can be altered since it is not embedded in the blockchain.  Bitcoin’s Ordinal NFTs are different in that there isn’t a file of referenceable metadata that describes the NFT; instead, the entire data file resides in the witness signature field of Bitcoin transactions. That means the entirety of Ordinal NFTs live and breathe on the blockchain.  Whether that matters or not is really up to the user, but Ordinal NFTs bring an additional level of immutability to NFTs.  How do I mint an Ordinal NFT?  Ordinal NFTs are really new, so their accessibility is limited as the ecosystem builds out. There are two main ways to mint your own Ordinal NFT right now.  The first way is by starting up a full Bitcoin node and running Ord on the node. Then you can start inscribing satoshis into a wallet you control to make Ordinal NFTs. This method is technically involved and is more suitable for tech savvy hobbyists and those who really love NFTs.  The other way to inscribe an Ordinal NFT is to use a no-code inscription tool. It’s a far more casual experience and works fine if you don’t mind inserting a little trust into your minting process. I own an Ordinal NFT and I minted it using one of these no-code tools called Gamma. It is relatively straightforward for those familiar with Bitcoin, but it can be a bit tricky at parts.  This is how I did it:  Before you start, make sure you have some bitcoin (~$50 worth) so that you can pay the transaction fee for your inscription. The wallet you have it in must be able to send bitcoin to Taproot addresses. Here’s a good list of wallets and service providers who support Taproot. What you need to look for is in the “Send to Bech32m'' column – which is different than the “Send to Bech32” column, so make sure you are scanning the correct one. A “Yes” in that Bech32m column indicates if the wallet can send bitcoin to Taproot addresses. Note that popular exchanges like Coinbase and Binance do not support Taproot.  Once you have your transaction fee bitcoin secured in your wallet, you can start minting your Ordinal NFT. Here’s the step-by-step I used to mint my first Ordinal using Gamma. You could also use something like OrdinalsBot and the process would be more or less the same.  Go to: https://gamma.io/ordinals  Choose your inscription type, either an image file or just plain text.  Upload the desired file by selecting the file from your desktop or typing in the text directly where indicated.  Select a transaction fee rate based on how long you are willing to wait for your NFT to mint. Take note of the estimated mint times provided for the various fee rate choices.  Here’s one of the tricky parts of the process. The next step is to designate the bitcoin address where the Ordinal NFT should be sent. The address needs to be either a Taproot address or an Ordinal-compatible address.  I would recommend using Sparrow Wallet for this step. Here is a link to a step-by-step guide to setting up Sparrow Wallet for Ordinal NFTs.  Once you have your Sparrow Wallet address set up, drop it into the “Recipient bitcoin address” field on the Gamma website. Make sure the first four characters of this address are “bc1p.” This prefix indicates that the address is a Taproot address.  Pay your transaction fee for minting the Ordinal NFT by sending the indicated amount of bitcoin to the indicated address. Note that this address will also start with “bc1p.” It is very important to be careful here. I would recommend sending the bitcoin for this payment from a different wallet than the wallet receiving your Ordinal NFT unless you really know what you’re doing and are intimately familiar with coin control. If you are not careful you could mistakenly send a previously inscribed satoshi you own and you’d no longer have access to that NFT.  Wait. This could take up to a few days depending on the fee rate you selected. You will have received a link to check on the status of your minting.  Enjoy your NFT through an Ordinal viewer.  As always, be cognizant and careful with your behavior on bitcoin. Ordinals are new and they can be finicky. And everything you do on bitcoin can be easily tracked. So be aware that whatever you do can probably be linked back to you.  Happy Ordinaling!

42412766,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl6HQI,1677173565,Alameda-Backed Crypto Trader Folkvang Is Still Standing Despite Big Hit From FTX's Demise,"More than three months after the contagious collapse of the FTX exchange, the cryptocurrency industry is still reeling. Folkvang, a market-neutral, Cayman Island-based trading firm is still going despite suffering a major blow during November's crash.  ""Our equity was halved, so we lost a lot of the gains we made in 2021,"" Folkvang founder Mike van Rossum said in an interview with CoinDesk. ""This is the risk, right? This is the risk of the game. I guess we're happy we're still standing.""  Founded in January 2020 by a team of seasoned crypto quant traders, Folkvang rose to prominence across all major exchanges. For instance, it edged toward the top of FTX's volume and profit leaderboard in 2022. Folkvang's emergence on FTX was expected after Alameda Research, the trading firm that played a central role in FTX's demise, invested in Folkvang and Folkvang returned the favor by investing in FTX. (Sam Bankman-Fried owned both FTX and Alameda.)  Speaking on a recent video call from a high-rise Singapore office building, Folkvang's van Rossum provided a candid account of the ""messy"" situation in the aftermath of FTX's collapse.  ""It was a tough pill to swallow,"" van Rossum said after revealing that half of the company's equity was tied up on FTX. ""We were able to survive, but as we were quite active borrowers we had to pay the lenders back out of pocket.""  At its peak in 2021 Folkvang managed around $400 million in assets, including equity and loans. And even though it has a lean team of fewer than 10 quant traders, it once did $8 billion of volume during a single trading session during that bull market.  Folkvang acts solely as a proprietary high-frequency trading firm. It doesn't offer any other services as an over-the-counter desk or do market-maker token deals. It relies on a blend of algorithmic strategies that includes arbitrage trading, yield farming and market making.  Strategy shift  ""We learned a hard lesson with FTX,"" van Rossum continued. ""We found that risk is real. We thought it could never really happen in the way it did, so we are a lot more risk averse now.""  He added: ""We just trade our own balance sheet. We aren't really borrowing at all. The risk is just too big.""  As Folkvang is a market-neutral trading firm, it avoids directional risk and profits by providing liquidity and trading off negative and positive funding rates against each other. It is the antithesis of long-only shops like Three Arrows Capital, which spectacularly collapsed in a cascade of liquidations last year as the market tumbled.  Although directional risk for Folkvang is minimal, the fall of FTX has intensified the fears of counterparty risk. Holding assets on an exchange has always been frowned upon by bitcoin (BTC) maximalists, but for a trading firm like Folkvang it's unavoidable. Arbitrage trading involves buying an asset for a certain price on an exchange and selling it immediately for a higher price on another; this requires active capital across multiple centralized venues.  When asked where Folkvang trades now that FTX is defunct, van Rossum replied: ""Binance is the biggest, but I don't think it's because of trust.""  He continued: ""We still have a company. We have an office. We have a team of people. We still have to pay the bills. So Binance offers a good risk/reward ratio, but the risk is still there.""  Hopeful of FTX resolution  After losing around 50% of its trading equity on FTX, Folkvang remains confident that a portion of the funds will be returned, even if it takes between five to eight years.  ""We're definitely engaging with lawyers,"" he said. ""We're engaging with the bankruptcy people, but it's hard to do something here as the situation is complicated.""  Alameda ""invested in us so they're on our cap table and we invested in FTX, so it's all intermixed,"" he said. ""And then we had our money there, so it's a very messy situation.""  Folkvang finds itself as a redacted entity on FTX's top 50 creditors list, with individual creditors at the top end of the list being owed as much as $226 million.  ""This will be a long process,"" van Rossum added. ""We have mentally written it off to zero. We aren't thinking we're going to be getting back X or Y. Mentally, it's written off but we are hopeful that we will get something. But it will take many, many, many years.""

42393914,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brc3zr,1677172687,Casey Rodarmor: The Quest to Make Bitcoin Fun Again,"Bitcoin is trying out non-fungible tokens (NFT) again.  First there were colored coins in 2012, which were aimed at representing all types of non-bitcoin assets on Bitcoin.  Then came Counterparty in 2014, which was built as a derivative of Bitcoin and allowed the creation, buying and selling of digital assets powered by its XCP token. Counterparty is where “Rare Pepes” – NFTs inspired by the Pepe the Frog meme – were born in 2016, which far predate the NFTs of Ethereum we know today.  This profile is part of CoinDesk’s “BUIDL Week.""  This time around, it’s Ordinal NFTs and inscriptions, which are made possible by the Ordinal protocol developed by Casey Rodarmor.  I interviewed him for BUIDL Week.  Rodarmor has worked in technology since 2010. He spent time working for Google before a brief stint at Chaincode Labs doing some nominal work on Bitcoin Core, the protocol’s main code implementation. He now acts as a co-host of SF Bitcoin BitDevs in San Francisco after taking over from River Financial founder Alexander Leishman last year.  Bitcoin BitDevs, which started in New York City, is a community that hosts monthly meetups to discuss some of the more technical aspects of Bitcoin. Rodarmor’s place at the helm in San Francisco is an indication of his commitment to testing out new Bitcoin ideas. Bitcoin BitDevs is a critical piece of Bitcoin’s grassroots culture.  He now works on Ordinals full time, he said during our interview. The project now has paid interns (Liam Scalzulli and RaphJaph) and paid Discord moderators.  Read more: Michael Casey - Bitcoin Ordinals Can Lift the Entire Crypto Ecosystem  Rodarmor is a Bitcoiner, and no one can tell him otherwise. He got into Bitcoin because he “hate[s] the government” and is in the “sound money camp” when it comes to Bitcoin, he told the ""Stephan Livera"" podcast earlier this month. He likes Bitcoin because it is better, nonstate money with a predictable, sound monetary policy; it’s not because it can enable NFTs.  Still, he’s now best known as the guy who enabled the most recent iteration of NFTs on Bitcoin.  Motivation  Rodarmor started working on Ordinals in 2022. During the conversation Erin, his personal assistant and podcast co-host of Rodarmor’s podcast ""Hell Money"", was sitting on a couch in the background. I also noticed a trap bar deadlift barbell to Rodarmor’s right when he adjusted his camera.  “Do you lift?” I asked. “Yeah!” he responds, but laments that lifting in his apartment proved pretty loud. He adds that he thinks he has some “pretty juicy traps.”  He does. Rodarmor looks relatively fit for someone who develops software full time.  He originally learned about NFTs in 2017 and wasn’t particularly interested in the type of digital art that was being created, bought and sold. He toyed with the idea for an auction house for digital art at the time, but only briefly. Then came Art Blocks, an influential generative digital art project on Ethereum founded by Erick Calderon. Its new aesthetic caught Rodarmor's eye.  Rodarmor was inspired to work on a Ethereum smart contract using Solidity but became frustrated with Ethereum, which he describes as a “Rube Goldberg machine.” He didn’t like the idea of building NFTs on Ethereum so he gave up that idea. Then, in early 2022, he picked up the idea for NFTs again and wanted to figure out how to do it on Bitcoin.  Read more: Bitcoin NFTs: What Are Ordinal NFTs and How Do You Mint One?  When he started working on Ordinals, he told me he drew inspiration directly from Bitcoin’s pseudonymous founder Satoshi Nakamoto. Satoshi included references to something called “atoms” in the original Bitcoin codebase and it was from there that Ordinal theory was born. (For the technically inclined or generally interested, check out Jeremy Rubin’s annotation of the original Bitcoin codebase.)  Part of Rodarmor’s motivation is to make Bitcoin fun again (as he tweeted earlier this year about Bitcoin NFTs). It is a bear market after all. He certainly seemed to be enjoying himself during our interview.  Ordinals are hilariously simple, at least in theory. The Ordinal protocol outlines a way in which to sequentially number satoshis – the smallest unit of bitcoin, which represents 1/100,000,000 of a bitcoin. And once satoshis are given a serial number, users can inscribe data onto those satoshis to make digital artifacts, which is Rodarmor’s preferred term over NFTs.  Not because these aren’t NFTs, but because these NFTs are a touch better, in his view. Inscriptions are always immutable: the art, text or whatever inscribed data is put directly on the blockchain. This differs from most other types of NFTs that tend to store the actual JPG or text file somewhere else and then put a link to that data on the blockchain. Whether you care about NFTs or not, this is a clear upgrade to the immutability of NFTs.  Backlash  Somehow, this seemingly simple technology update has come with quite a bit of embedded seriousness. Some OGs in the space have described Ordinals as an attack on Bitcoin’s founding mission to conduct unfettered financial transactions. People who support Bitcoin want Bitcoin to survive. They also tend to own bitcoin and they want their bitcoin to be safe. Anything that could be construed as a threat to the Bitcoin protocol is a threat to the sovereignty of bitcoin users and holders.  And so Rodarmor has found himself as the main character of this season’s Bitcoin Crisis.  Read more: Bitcoin Community Erupts in Existential Debate Over NFT Project Ordinals  I asked how he felt about being on the receiving end of much criticism.  He thought that the “vibe was now very good once [he] got to know where his critics were coming from.” He was initially very defensive, but once he started taking the time to engage with the more thoughtful, careful critics through some one-on-one conversations there was substantial common ground. Rodarmor feels that the Bitcoin community is mostly filled with these types of thoughtful critics. Those who are “yelling for the sake of yelling” are in the minority (even though they are loud on Twitter).  Of these thoughtful critics, Rodarmor referenced conversations with Blockstream’s Warren Togami. Togami founded Fedora Linux, a distribution of the open-source computer operating system Linux, so his understanding of open-source projects is credibly good.  Togami says that if the Bitcoin community decides different fee rates are appropriate for different classes of traffic on the Bitcoin network (read: regular financial Bitcoin transactions vs. Ordinal NFT Bitcoin transactions), that’s up to them. As a community project, isn’t it up to Bitcoiners to decide and then consequently run code that can add quality of service information like priority to transactions? (Here’s a somewhat technical tweet thread that touches on this topic.)  Rodarmor thinks that approach won’t work. But hopefully that’s the type of criticism and discourse that is good for Bitcoin in the long run.  From the other loud Ordinals critics there are valid concerns that Ordinal NFTs will lead to irreversible chain bloat. Because inscriptions have led to an influx of large blocks, it might become more difficult for new node participants to start up due to the immense amount of data that will accumulate over time. New node participants are critical to maintain Bitcoin as a decentralized, permissionless and robust monetary network – where those without economic majority can still have input in how Bitcoin should be run.  In theory, Ordinal NFTs could increase transaction fees which will incentivize miners to stick around in the future once the block subsidy ends. The block subsidy is the new bitcoins which are awarded to miners for successfully mining a block. It is the main way miners are financially compensated now.  Miners help secure the Bitcoin network so when that subsidy goes away, transaction fees may need to increase so that miners don’t leave the network en masse.  Projects like Ordinals could improve Bitcoin’s economics, helping to solve its growing security budget problem.

The board – 24 directors elected by the IMF’s member countries – earlier this month had been presented with a staff paper that warned of the risks crypto poses to monetary policy, tax collection, financial stability and consumer protection.  “Directors generally agreed that crypto assets should not be granted official currency or legal tender status in order to safeguard monetary sovereignty and stability,” the statement said, calling for countries to clarify tax treatment and align with global standards.  “Directors agreed that strict bans are not the first-best option, but that targeted restrictions could apply” to limit crypto risks, though some board members think “outright bans should not be ruled out,” the statement continued. ""The growing adoption of crypto assets in some countries, the extra-territorial nature of crypto assets and its providers, as well as the increasing interlinkages with the financial system, motivate the need for a comprehensive, consistent, and coordinated response.""  Regulations shouldn’t stifle innovation, and governments can benefit from the underlying digital technology, the statement added.

42412773,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl6HVu,1677168874,US Banking Regulators Warn Banks About Crypto Liquidity Risks,"The Federal Reserve and other U.S. banking agencies are warning banks that crypto poses significant liquidity dangers, according to a joint statement issued Thursday, further reinforcing their campaign to generally steer lenders away from digital assets.  While the agencies – which also included the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. – insist that it’s not illegal for U.S. banks to engage in cryptocurrency activities, this latest in a series of formal cautionary statements makes it clear that any lender dabbling in crypto will have a lot of explaining to do to its regulators.  The agencies’ joint statement points out that crypto firms’ bank deposits could be unstable and driven by “crypto-asset sector dynamics,” even if the company itself is stable.  “Such deposits can be susceptible to large and rapid inflows as well as outflows, when end customers react to crypto-asset-sector-related market events, media reports, and uncertainty,” the regulators said, also specifically flagging stablecoin reserves deposited at banks, which they said can be volatile during “unanticipated stablecoin redemptions or dislocations in crypto-asset markets.”  The U.S. regulators had already formally warned the banking industry about significant involvement in virtual currencies and contend that banks that rely on crypto activity as a significant portion of their business would draw heightened scrutiny over safety-and-soundness concerns. Thursday’s statement reminded the banks that such concentration is on the agencies’ minds.  “When a banking organization’s deposit funding base is concentrated in crypto-asset-related entities that are highly interconnected or share similar risk profiles, deposit fluctuations may also be correlated, and liquidity risk therefore may be further heightened,” it said.  The regulators are advising the banks they oversee to monitor and assess risk if they are engaged in crypto activity.  “This is the right step to provide more clarity to banking organizations and protect people’s hard-earned money as we continue to consider a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets,” Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said in a statement responding to the regulators' warning.

42421374,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnuFJ,1677165844,Ethereum’s Regens Tend to Ethereum’s Public Goods,"Although the term goes all the way back to pre-modern times, the first rigorous framework for defining public goods was created in the 1950s, first by economist Paul Samuelson and then later Richard Musgrave, who formulated the definitions of “non-rivalry” and “non-excludability” that we so often use today. Goods like clean air, parks, roads or national defense are often used as canonical examples of these types of goods – if one person has access to it, everyone does, and one person’s use can never deplete another’s.  This article is part of CoinDesk’s “BUIDL Week.” Dr. Paul Dylan-Ennis is an assistant professor in the College of Business, University College Dublin. Scott Moore is a co-founder at Gitcoin, an internet-native community focused on building and funding digital public goods.  These definitions were created at a very particular time in a nascently global post-World War II environment. Nationalism was still a prominent feature of contemporary life, and how we understood the notion of “the public” beyond the foundational borders of states wasn’t always clear to a society whose well-being and very survival depended on them. In a post-internet age, the conversation around global public goods and what we mean by the term has grown significantly. It’s become clear that there are much broader degrees of excludability and rivalry when we think about these goods: A road might only be accessible if you’re allowed into a particular city and a gate might be locked around a park during night-time hours.  The internet, although far more omnipresent, is still not fully accessible around the world even as projects like Starlink continue to roll out.  We still pay for all kinds of not-so-public goods because we recognize that aspirationally we care about the openness of the goods in question, but practically we’re focused on the positive externalities they generate. We pay for local subway systems that might overflow from demand and where riders pay a fee, because it helps the city thrive.  By paying, riders form communities and organizations that build economic activity, property holders thrive as value accrues around stations and, in turn, the taxes levied return value back to the city. Despite their restrictions, goods like the subway system add to our collective well-being.  Ethereum, like a subway system, produces meaningful positive externalities, even if it sometimes gets clogged with transactions. Volumes have been written about the way the so-called world computer could increase human agency and coordination, with some even comparing what’s been and remains to be built to a city. Others have noted that programmable money enables us to move value the same way the early internet enabled us to transfer information.  See also: Ethereum's Political Philosophy Explained | Opinion  In one sense then, Ethereum is a public good: It’s built for its own kind of digital city, often by its citizens, with the aim of improving everyone’s well-being. Practically, though, like most things we define this way, and especially with no state in sight, Ethereum functions like a commons, and all common goods need to be carefully maintained.  Governing the Ethereum commons  In 2009, Elinor Ostrom was given a Nobel Prize for her work on governing the commons. She showed that by designing local, self-organized systems we could solve what American ecologist Garrett Hardin called the “tragedy of the commons:” the inevitable depletion of our most basic necessities (e.g. fisheries) without any state or company to oversee their maintenance.  In Ethereum, our maintenance means taking part in writing meaningful open-source software, participating in decentralized governance and preventing the dilution of the foundational cultural principles of the ecosystem that have been battle-tested over multiple cycles.  Managing a commons like Ethereum is a complicated process. Unlike in traditional centralized models of organization, Ethereum’s management is distributed across a number of stakeholders, who have to reach rough consensus over a protocol hosting billions of dollars in value.  Ethereum’s blockocracy, those users most focused on upkeep – various client team developers, researchers, validators, and large-scale foundations like the Ethereum Foundation – help ensure this is the case. But builders on Ethereum – those developing decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO), decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols or non-fungible tokens (NFT) – share this responsibility, too.  Where we fall short is in our failure to recognize the self-organizing ecosystem we live in and take on our respective responsibilities, as in the case of the recent Goerli testnet bridge. We cross over thin lines and sometimes add one more cow to the field than we are supposed to, accelerating its decline.  Ethereum is trapped between two sides: On one side it is seen as home to an astonishing ecosystem of innovative smart contracts designed to produce and sustain global public infrastructure (the regens) and on the other it is known as the home of innovative permissionless DeFi and NFT innovation that sometimes leads to rug pulls (the degens). Degens can play a vital role in our ecosystem, but we need to define how these groups work together. These sides don’t need to be in conflict, but they do need to coordinate.  Perhaps a better framing to align both sides comes down to the difference between what John Doerr called missionaries and mercenaries. Deep down many of those who self-identify as degens do care about the ethos of Ethereum, rather than saying the right Shibboleths like FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried.  Missionaries are, as we say, “in it for the tech.” But left to their own devices, mercenaries would seek to make Ethereum as a place where we can engineer our own disasters more openly and transparently.  See also: DAOs Are the New Way of Impact Work | Opinion  Radical permissionless is sacrosanct in crypto cultures. It is non-negotiable, like decentralization or censorship resistance. Since nobody can be denied access to a blockchain at a technical level, it always comes down to the question of culture and expectations. Let’s do our best to set those expectations.  By believing in Ethereum as a public good, and developing a strong and robust culture around why these kinds of public infrastructure matter, we can prevent mercenaries and fortify our ecosystem for the next cycle. We can create our own future, between regen and degen, by learning to see the Ethereum ecosystem as a shared commons that needs to be tended to, not overgrazed.

With the integration, users new to Audius can simply create accounts by linking their TikTok profile. From there, listeners can automatically import their handle, information and carry over their TikTok verification status to Audius.  Additionally, users can share Audius songs in their TikTok videos. Because TikTok sounds are a popular feature of the app that can help creators’ videos go viral, the integration may further amplify the reach of the Audius.

The spike in price didn't last, however, and as of this writing, AUDIO’s price was 32 cents, a 90% drop from August 2021.

42412779,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl6JMy,1677162259,Sam Bankman-Fried Hit With Additional Bank Fraud Charges in New Indictment,"FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried faces additional charges, including bank fraud allegations, under a new indictment unveiled Thursday morning.  U.S. officials are now charging the onetime crypto wunderkind with bank fraud and operating an unlicensed money transmitter in addition to the eight counts he already faced. Bankman-Fried also faces a modified campaign-finance law charge, conspiracy to make unlawful political contributions.  Previously, he faced only charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud on customers; wire fraud on customers; conspiracy to commit wire fraud on lenders; wire fraud on lenders; conspiracy to commit commodities fraud; conspiracy to commit securities fraud; conspiracy to commit money laundering; and conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to defraud the U.S. and violate campaign-finance laws.  Bankman-Fried and others, in a bid to open a bank account, “falsely represented to a financial institution that the account would be used for trading and market making,” when it was in reality to be used to receive and transmit customer funds, the unsealed charges said. He opened a company, with a deliberately obscure name of North Dimension, to tell a “false story” to an unnamed bank that had previously been reluctant to open an account, authorities added.  Bankman-Fried and other conspirators “agreed to and did make corporate contributions to candidates and committees in the Southern District of New York that were reported in the name of another person,” the document added.  FTX's former CEO wanted to give at least $1 million to a pro-LGBTQ political action committee, but he couldn’t find anyone bisexual or gay at the company whom he trusted, the document said. One unnamed executive whose description matches Nishad Singh, who was director of engineering at FTX, was urged to make the donation, while another executive did so for Republican causes, the document said.  In July, Singh gave $1.1 million to the LGBTQ Victory Fund Federal PAC, according to records from the Federal Election Commission, an independent U.S. regulatory agency tasked with enforcing federal campaign-finance law. It was the committee's biggest donation by far, and the money was generally used for so-called independent expenditures – or unofficial campaign contributions – to buy advertising for now-Rep. Becca Balint (D-Vt.).  As for the Republican causes, Ryan Salame was the most prominent FTX executive making donations to conservative candidates and committees, becoming one of the top Republican contributors in the last elections.  Before midterms, ""an internal Alameda spreadsheet noted over $100 million in political contributions, even though FEC records reflect no political contributions by Alameda for the 2022 midterm elections to candidates or PACs.""  Alameda Research is a trading firm that Bankman-Fried owned.  “Bankman-Fried's use of straw donors allowed him to evade contribution limits on individual donations to candidates to whom he had already donated,” the document said, adding that the “fraudulent conduct” impaired the FEC’s functioning.  The document calls on Bankman-Fried to forfeit hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of assets, which in many cases have already been seized by the government. They include more than 55 million shares trading app Robinhood Markets (HOOD) currently valued at $550 million. The motion also calls for the seizure of over $140 million in cash held at Silvergate Bank and Farmington State Bank in the name of FTX Digital Markets.  Bankman-Fried is set to face trial in October.  A spokesperson for Bankman-Fried declined to comment.  Update (Feb. 23, 2023 14:45 UTC): Adds more detail throughout.

42421378,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnuLV,1677159000,The SEC’s Crackdown on Ethereum Staking Has a Silver Lining,"While this year’s price performance of the two largest cryptocurrencies has been impressive, with bitcoin (BTC) up over 46% year to date and ether (ETH) up over 37% YTD, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been aggressively pursuing increased regulation on cryptocurrencies and has sued large cryptocurrency exchanges and custodians.  Earlier this year, Kraken, a U.S.-based crypto trading platform and custodian, settled with the SEC and agreed to discontinue its “Crypto Asset Staking-as-a-Service” program in the U.S. and to pay a $30 million fine.  This aggressive action from U.S. regulators has left many crypto investors concerned about the future of the industry. But while concerning, it may actually help the industry by increasing decentralization and provide much needed clarity.  You're reading Crypto for Advisors, a weekly look at digital assets and the future of finance for financial advisors. Subscribe here to receive the mailing every Thursday.  Staking services in review  When Ethereum completed a successful network upgrade in 2022, shifting from a proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain to a proof-of-stake (PoS) network, this created an opportunity for individuals to earn blockchain rewards by running a network validator node and contributing to network security. Under the new PoS mechanism, the Ethereum network is secured by validators instead of miners, and those running a validator may earn rewards paid to them directly by the network, for their help in securing and running the network.  Running a validator on Ethereum requires more technical knowledge than many cryptocurrency investors have, which led companies to offer “staking-as-a-service” products to retail traders and investors. Kraken, along with others, offered their customers the ability to stake Ethereum collectively, in a commingled staking pool, to generate staking rewards.  While many investors appreciated these services, the SEC did not. Its public complaint states, “Kraken has offered and sold its crypto asset ‘staking services’ to the general public, whereby Kraken pools certain crypto assets transferred by investors and stakes them on behalf of those investors. Staking is a process in which investors lock up – or ‘stake’ – their crypto tokens with a blockchain validator with the goal of being rewarded with new tokens when their staked crypto tokens become part of the process for validating data for the blockchain. When investors provide tokens to staking-as-a-service providers, they lose control of those tokens and take on risks associated with those platforms, with very little protection.”  The SEC argued that this service, offered by Kraken and others, violates modern securities rules and “staking-as-a-service” products are unregulated securities offerings. While we’ve seen many crypto lending products fail (Gemini Earn, Voyager Digital and Celsius Network), crypto staking is quite different from lending, which has caused many to push back on the SEC’s claims.  Read more: How Does Ethereum Staking Work?  Staking is actually simpler to understand than crypto lending. Outsourced and pooled staking, in particular, is a process in which investors pool their tokens together and a centralized entity deposits the pooled tokens into a validator to secure the network. When the pooled assets earn a reward from the network, the controller distributes the earnings to the participants in the pool.  Also, while crypto lending is seen as a risky endeavor, staking does not involve lending pooled capital to hedge funds or traders. No leverage is involved, and it does not require underwriting or risk management practices that are seen in asset lending.  Although crypto staking is less complex and risky than crypto lending, the SEC still took issue with the process, effectively shutting down all U.S.-based “staking-as-a-service” product offerings.  So how does this change the Ethereum landscape?  Increased Ethereum decentralization ahead  Because Ethereum is now a proof-of-stake blockchain, staking assets in validators is crucial to network security and proper function.  Because exchanges are not allowed to offer staking services to their clients, none of the Ethereum currently held on exchanges will be able to contribute to network security. In order to be staked on the network, Ethereum will be required to be withdrawn from exchanges and staked via another method.  While the SEC’s actions have harmed the future of centralized staking services, which many would argue benefits retail investors in the long run, their rulings will ultimately push cryptocurrency to be more decentralized and distributed.  Read more: Proof-of-Work vs. Proof-of-Stake: What Is the Difference?  Companies like Lido and Rocket Pool offer “decentralized” staking services through their platforms. There’s also the option of running an individual node, directly on the Ethereum network – even though this requires significant technical savvy, and if done incorrectly, may result in loss of tokens.  The SEC does not have the ability to prevent users from staking ETH tokens themselves or from using a decentralized staking service. Many cryptocurrency advocates believe that these regulations only strengthen the future of cryptocurrency, by forcing them to adhere to the principles of decentralization and anonymity that they emerged from.  While recent regulations limit the number of centralized companies that can contribute to network security, it forces many individuals to pursue more decentralized options. One of the risks with centralized staking services is that one large institution, or a group of two or three, may gain majority power over the network if their service becomes large enough. This would put the network at risk of centralized control and manipulation. The SEC barring firms from pooled staking will force individuals to run their own node, which will increase decentralization and network security.  While the SEC regulations may temporarily halt crypto innovation in the financial sector, it will likely strengthen the use case of decentralized finance and increase the network decentralization and diversification. True to the very roots cryptocurrency was founded upon, SEC regulations seem to be forcing crypto to be truly independent from modern financial systems.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Jackson Wood,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/02/23/the-secs-crackdown-on-ethereum-staking-has-a-silver-lining,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f241ce6ab82cd926c101a49e92f192d2ab428b8b-7952x5304.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The 181,972 shares added to ARKK appear to be Ark Invest's biggest single purchase of Coinbase's shares this year. Earlier this week, Coinbase reported quarterly earnings that beat expectations, but its stock slipped 1.4% on Wednesday as crypto assets experienced a broad pullback. The crypto exchange’s stock is up 82% year to date to $61.18, but down from its closing-day peak of $342 in November 2021.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has said a $1.02 billion deal by Binance’s U.S. wing to purchase assets of bankrupt crypto lender Voyager Digital may be unlawful. Specifically, the redistribution of crypto assets to account holders – particularly Voyager’s VGX token – could amount to the sale of unregistered securities, according to the SEC. The sale of Voyager to Binance.US received almost universal approval from creditors on Wednesday, with 97% of them voting in favor of the deal.  Music streaming service Spotify may be dipping its toe into Web3 with a new pilot involving “token-enabled playlists,” allowing holders of non-fungible tokens to connect their wallets and listen to curated music. Spotify is offering this exclusively to token holders in the Fluf, Moonbirds, Kingship and Overlord communities for a three-month testing period. Spotify told CoinDesk that it ""routinely conducts a number of tests in an effort to improve our user experience.""     Chart of the Day  The table shows the probabilities for the Federal Reserve rate hikes over the coming months.  Early this month, traders were confident that the Fed would hike its benchmark interest rate just by 25 basis points in March, but now they see a 26% chance of a 50 basis point rate hike in March.  Traders see a 28% chance of rates rising as high as 5.75% in July from the current 4.75%.  The Fed tightening is now seen extending into the third quarter, Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex and the author of the Marc to Market blog, wrote in the daily newsletter.  Aggressive repricing of continued Fed rate hikes might put pressure on risky assets, including cryptocurrencies.  - Omkar Godbole  Trending Posts  What Coinbase's Q4 Earnings Mean for Crypto Adoption  An Overlooked Source of BTC Support: Its Price Floor  Was OneCoin’s Missing Cryptoqueen Murdered by Mobsters?",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | BNB,"Jamie Crawley, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/02/23/first-mover-americas-cathie-wood-doubles-down-on-coinbase,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cd5d52b77254796f409c910661e065fcc1c31f0a-4316x3237.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42412795,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl6JZ8,1677157200,Bitcoin Mining Consulting Firm Sabre56 Raises $35M to Build 150MW of Hosting Sites,"Sabre56, a company that consults miners on the development and operations of facilities, has raised $35 million to build its own hosting sites, aiming to have 150 megawatts (MW) of energy capacity ready by the end of the year. Hosting is a service that data centers provide to crypto miners that want to run their mining rigs without having to build the infrastructure themselves.  The first four sites will total 115 MW and be located in Wyoming and Texas, where construction has already begun, according to a press release. The capacity will be built in 7MW-15 MW of monthly increments, with the first batch coming online in mid-March, company CEO Phil Harvey said. The $35 million investment is coming primarily from private individuals, he added.  Hosting space for mining rigs has been in short supply over the past few months as few new sites were coming online and capital for development ran dry. The bankruptcies of major hosting firms like Compute North and Core Scientific (CORZ) heightened the supply issue.  Sabre56 will offer competitive pricing between $0.068-$0.072 per kilowatt hour (kWh) of electricity consumed, depending on the duration of the contract and the type of machines, Harvey said. For comparison, Core Scientific increased its hosting price to just under 10 cents in October as soaring natural gas prices increased its electricity costs.  Harvey declined to specify the price of the fixed-rate electricity contracts that Sabre56 has signed.  Sabre56 already has a ""waiting list"" of clients, said the press release. Harvey specified that it is comprised mostly of companies and individuals already close to the company, and the contracts are in the 10 MW-50 MW range. In addition to its projections to have 150 MW online by the end of 2023, the company plans to keep adding 150 MW of capacity annually for the next four years. The profits made from the initial investments will be enough to continue this further development, Harvey said.  ""I'm not interested in taking over, some s***show that people are trying to sell because they're going bankrupt and can't run their operations,"" said Harvey, responding to a question from CoinDesk about why his company has chosen not to purchase an existing development from a distressed miner.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | MARKET | MINING | SPONSORED | TRADING,Eliza Gkritsi,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/02/23/bitcoin-mining-consulting-firm-sabre56-raises-35m-to-build-150mw-of-hosting-sites,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fb2269a5d3687f4cd960f263de681fba177ac717-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42412791,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl6JYC,1677156693,Ransomware Gang Conti Has Re-Surfaced and Now Operates as Three Groups: TRM Labs,"The world of cybercrime saw some notable changes over the past year: new darknet marketplaces took the place of the shut down Hydra and operators of the notorious Conti ransomware group rebranded under new names, said the blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs.  In a new report analyzing the re-shaping of cybercrime industry since the beginning of the Russian war in Ukraine, TRM named alleged successors of Conti, a once-notorious ransomware gang that extorted hundreds of bitcoins from the U.S. corporations, including health-care organizations during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to TRM, Conti “rebranded into at least three smaller groups: Black Basta, BlackByte and Karakurt.”  Conti has been successfully attacking multiple organizations in the U.S. encrypting their IT systems and demanding large ransom to unlock the files. In 2022, the group pledged its allegiance to Russia in the recently started war in Ukraine. Soon after that, allegedly, an insider unhappy about the decision leaked gigabytes of the group members’ messages to each other, discussing the hacks, payouts, ways to cash out crypto and just their everyday life.  But soon, either because of the leak of for some other reasons, Conti reportedly ceased operations. However, the hackers did not quit and the crypto wallets linked to Conti operators remained active and likely switched to other ransomware strains.  Read more: Ransomware Gang Extorted 725 BTC in One Attack, On-Chain Sleuths Find  In January, Chainalysis published a report saying that wallets of Conti’s alleged leader Stern “transacted with addresses linked to strains like Quantum, Karakurt, Diavol, and Royal in 2022 following Conti’s demise,” as ransomware operators are, apparently, usually work with multiple malware variants, simultaneously collaborating with a bunch of hacker collectives at once.  TRM says the main successor of Conti is most likely the ransomware group known as Karakurt. The link between the two was previously suggested by cybersecurity experts. According to a cybersecurity firm Avertium, Karakurt usually attacks organizations that have already been compromised before.  Just like Conti, Karakurt has been not above attacking health-care organizations, in particular a billing vendor Practice Resources, that’s been hit with an attack in August 2022. However, unlike Conti, Karakurt did not encrypt victims’ files but only stole them and threatened victims to leak it if a ransom wasn’t paid.  According TRM Labs, Karakurt has been active since at least October 2021. Both Conti and Karakurt used the same address to sent the ransomware payments they received in October 2021, TRM says, and later than address sent the money to a “high-risk exchange.”  “The timeline of Karakurt's off-chain and on-chain activity confirms that the group was active long prior to Conti's official shutdown that occurred in May 2023. Karakurt appears to have been set up by Conti in 2021 and became fully operational under its new brand in 2022,” TRM Labs head of legal and government affairs Ari Redbord told CoinDesk. He added that most likely, the same people were behind Conti and Karakurt.  As for cash-out methods for cybercriminals, darknet marketplaces, where anonymous vendors offer illegal drugs, fake documents and other shadow goods and services, are becoming a popular money laundering channel, TRM Labs said in the report. In a sense that these platforms merge together their users funds on centralized wallets, they serve partly as a kind of mixer, the reports said.  This money laundering option has been attracting even more cybercriminals recently, in particular, those that profit from the child sexual abuse materials (CSAM), or child pornography, TRM said. The firm registered an uptick of CSAM-related crypto inflows to Russia-associated darknet platforms, the report said.  The war could help that trend as Russia has become increasingly isolated from the West in the political and economical sense, TRM said. “It is possible that Russia’s political and economic estrangement from the West has fuelled perceptions that the country is a friendly jurisdiction for criminals seeking to evade Western law enforcement.” it added.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/02/23/ransomware-group-conti-has-re-surfaced-under-a-new-name-trm-labs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/54b0802b015561dee660a3ed58347caa17afd062-1500x1122.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42412778,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl6JM2,1677153763,Crypto Regulatory Initiatives Show SEC’s Dominance Among US Regulators: JPMorgan,"Recent regulatory initiatives have shown the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) dominant position in the U.S. in regulating the digital assets space, JPMorgan said in a research report last week.  Its actions have also shown the SEC’s bias in viewing most crypto, with maybe bitcoin (BTC) as the only exception, as securities, the report said. It noted that SEC Chair Gary Gensler started pushing back against implementing special rules for the crypto industry in September, arguing that most cryptocurrencies should be classed as securities and thus be regulated under existing securities laws.  “Given the above it should not come as a surprise that the SEC looks at the offering of a staking service as being similar to offering any other type of security,” the note said. This opens the way for other firms offering staking services to have to be registered as a securities platform with the SEC, the report added.  The bank predicted more regulatory actions on stablecoin issuers, custody and protection of investors’ digital assets, and on the unbundling of broker/trader/lending/clearing/custody activities.  It also expects mandated regular disclosure, reporting and auditing of reserves, assets and liabilities across major crypto entities, analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote. These regulations will lead to “convergence of the crypto ecosystem towards the traditional financial system over time,” he added.  “Staking business should shift more towards direct staking for institutional investors and more towards decentralized (DeFi staking) alternatives for retail investors,” the note said. DeFi is an umbrella term for a variety of financial applications carried out on a blockchain.  Ether (ETH) will likely see additional selling pressure on Ethereum following the forthcoming Shanghai upgrade, as crypto exchange Kraken has 1.2 million ETH staked on the network, a significant amount of which is owned by its U.S. clients. Adding the 1 million ether from staking rewards that could be withdrawn immediately after the upgrade, the downside risk to ether becomes even more significant, the note added.

The XRPL Standard provides specifications and guidelines for developers to build applications on the XRP Ledger, ensuring compatibility and communication across the network.  As posted on GitHub, the proposed standard would allow tokens from one blockchain to be locked in an account on the XRP Ledger, while an equivalent amount of tokens is issued on another blockchain – increasing the use cases and adoption of the XRP Ledger.  The proposal defines how transactions can be made on the XRP Ledger to ensure the movement of tokens between XRP Ledger and associated sidechains. Sidechains are independent chains that work adjacent to a parent blockchain, also called a mainnet.  Eight transaction types have been determined in the proposed standards to ensure the movement of tokens in a secure and efficient manner.  However, the developers pointed out the disadvantages of the previous design: “Handling fee escalation, failed transactions, and servers falling behind was much more complex,” one such disadvantage was pointed out.

The Solana community was as stunned by the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange as the broader market, the report said, noting that founder Anatoly Yakovenko believed that the blockchain’s “perceived linkages” with FTX have historically been overstated.  “Nevertheless, the fundamental value proposition of the Solana protocol persists from a technical perspective,” wrote analyst Brian Cubellis. As a “blockchain optimized for high throughput, de minimis costs and native scalability,” it represents a “legitimately differentiated approach within the layer 1 landscape,” he added.  Coinbase says given the ecosystem’s relative strength in terms of network activity with regards to transactions, users and development, Solana is well positioned to reassert itself as a genuine layer 1 competitor. A layer 1 network is the base layer, or the underlying infrastructure, of a blockchain.  Activity on Solana compares favorably to that on Ethereum at present, suggesting the solana (SOL) token may be undervalued relative to ether (ETH), the note said.  Furthermore, solana’s market capitalization is only about 4.3% of ether’s, while the amount of daily active users on the blockchain represents around 43.7% of Ethereum’s daily active user base.

GK8 solutions will continue to be available to the market, but Galaxy will also integrate the technology into its forthcoming prime brokerage platform, GalaxyOne.  Celsius filed for bankruptcy protection in July after crypto winter set in and put several assets up for sale – including GK8, which the lender had acquired for $115 million in November 2021.  The bankruptcy and continuing bear market pressure on valuations allowed Galaxy to pick up GK8 for approximately $44 million, a more than 60% discount. Galaxy had previously backed out of a $1.2 billion deal with crypto custodian BitGo, which led to a lawsuit.  The purchase will help build out GalaxyOne, the previously launched platform that will offer a wide range of financial services for institutions, including trading, lending, derivatives, cross-portfolio margining, and a number of custodial options, including GK8. Galaxy also gains an office in Tel Aviv and a nearly 40-person team, including the founders, who have joined Galaxy to lead its custodial technology offering.  “Investor demand for innovative and secure custody services continues to grow, and the acquisition of GK8 enhances our efforts to offer clients best-in-class cold storage solutions along with cutting-edge wallet technology,” said Galaxy Digital founder and CEO Michael Novogratz in a press release provided to CoinDesk. “In addition to continuing to offer highly valuable custody technology to clients, the GK8 team will play a pivotal role in our evolution to offer a full-service financial platform for digital assets.”  Self-custody for institutions  Founded in 2018, GK8 solutions are tailored toward traditional finance and crypto-native institutions such as banks, hedge funds and brokerage client eToro. The infrastructure lets clients enable staking, decentralized finance (DeFi) networks, non-fungible token (NFT) support, trading services and more.  GK8 offers its services through a multiparty computation (MPC) vault, an automated digital asset storage method that splits the private key needed to access the assets between an unlimited number of co-signers, and a cold vault, a slower but more secure method where transactions are processed manually.  While cold wallets keep assets safe by not connecting to the internet where private keys are vulnerable to hackers, most products on the market do need to go online at some point to get blockchain-validated data to verify the transaction. GK8 has developed patented cryptographic techniques that allow its cold vault to create, sign and send transactions to the blockchain without an internet connection, CEO Lior Lamesh explained to CoinDesk in an interview.  Read more: Hot vs. Cold Crypto Storage: What Are the Differences?  “Since we never receive input, it means we are not exposed to any cybersecurity attack vector. It’s not that we mitigate the risk here – we remove it,” said Lamesh.  Lamesh and GK8 co-founder and Chief Technology Officer Shahar Shamai previously worked together in the office of Israel’s prime minister to protect the country’s strategic assets from cyber attacks. GK8 was launched in 2018, and the company was acquired by Celsius three years later. GK8 was able to remain relatively unscathed during the bankruptcy because it was operating as an independent company, said Lamesh.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/02/23/galaxy-digital-closes-44m-acquisition-of-self-custody-platform-gk8,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/603736fcf3715ad9e8dbc665b2b1b7f97717464b-5000x3333.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The protocol holds over $450 million in locked tokens over the Ethereum and Optimism blockchains as of Thursday. It held just shy of $3 billion in total locked value (TVL) at its February 2021 record high.  Developers previously stated said that Synthetix v3 will have much more efficient architecture to allow developers to create faster, complex and more efficient decentralized financial (DeFi) applications.  V3 will allow the creation of products that offer a liquid market for any financial derivative that developers want to build, from traditional financial markets to more exotic markets such as no-loss lotteries or even wholly separate protocols.  V3 will also offer simplified staking and differentiated debt pools, allowing network stakers to supply collateral to, and receive fees from, specific asset pools without having to be exposed to every Spartan Council-supported asset.

42412793,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl6Jcs,1677147721,"Bitcoin Stuck in Bearish Elliott Wave Pattern Despite 47% Rally, QCP Capital Says","Bitcoin's (BTC) resurgence this year has convinced many analysts the crypto bear market has ended and the path of least resistance is to the higher side. QCP Capital suggests otherwise.  According to the Singapore-based crypto options trading giant, bitcoin's 47% year-to-date rally looks like a ""bear breather"" within a broader slide that began November 2021, and the final leg of the bear market could soon resume.  The analysis is based on Elliot Wave theory introduced by Ralph Nelson Elliott in 1938 in his book, ""The Wave Principle."" The theory assumes that asset price movements can be predicted by observing and identifying a repetitive wave pattern.  Elliott found that market trends unfold in five waves, of which Waves 1, 3, and 5 are ""impulse waves"" representing the primary trend. Waves 2 and 4 are ""retrace waves,"" representing a temporary ""breather"" to the preceding impulse waves. An important rule is that the first wave tends to be roughly the same size as the fifth, and the third wave is usually the longest.  In QCP's analysis, bitcoin's slide from November 2021's record high of $69,000 to the January 2022 low of $39,000 represents Wave 1 and the subsequent bounce to $48,000 through March 2022 represents Wave 2 – a bear breather, or temporary partial retrace of the preceding slide.  The crash from $48,000 to the November 2022 low of $15,480 represents Wave 3, and the recent bounce constitutes Wave 4 – a bear breather similar to Wave 2.  Next up is Wave 5, which in QCP's analysis could push the cryptocurrency down to the Wave 3 low of $15,480, if not deeper.  ""A potential double top is forming against the August 2022 correction high, and May 2022 reaction is low at 25,300,"" QCP Capital's market insights team said in an update published Wednesday. ""Above that, we have the huge 28,800-30,000 resistance, which is the Head and Shoulders neckline. Until these levels break, our 5 wave count still remains valid, with a final Wave 5 lower to come.""  QCP's analysis comes a week after former Goldman Sachs analyst William Noble told CoinDesk that the cryptocurrency is primed for a rally toward $56,000.  Identifying waves is an art. It is a subjective call. Each wave can can be broken down into sub-waves, as seen below, which makes the analysis quite challenging compared with traditional Dow Theory.  The chart by QCP shows the five-wave bearish structure, with the fifth and final wave lower yet to unfold.  Wave 4, identified by the year-to-date gain, has stalled around $25,000, a resistance level dating back to the August 2022 high. A turn lower now would confirm a potential double, as pointed out by QCP, and may signal the beginning of the Wave 5 sell-off.  The bearish five-wave structure will be invalidated should the ongoing Wave 4 rises above the resistance range of $28,800-$30,000.

42412799,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl6LWk,1677142865,"SEC Objects to Binance.US’ $1B Voyager Deal, Alleging Sale of Unregistered Securities","A $1.02 billion deal by Binance.US to purchase assets of defunct crypto lender Voyager Digital has been opposed by New York and federal finance regulators, who said in Feb. 22 filings it could prove discriminatory and unlawful.  The move follows increasing interventions into crypto by the Securities and Exchange Commission, whose probes into the alleged sales of unregistered securities recently caused crypto exchange Kraken to shutter crypto staking operations in the U.S.  Elements of the proposed Binance.US-Voyager deal may also infringe the law, given how the plan envisages repaying Voyager’s former customers, the SEC said.  Under the deal, “the transactions in crypto assets necessary to effectuate the rebalancing, the redistribution of such assets to Account Holders, may violate the prohibition in Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 against the unregistered offer, sale, or delivery after sale of securities,” a filing by the SEC said, citing in particular the VGX token issued by Voyager.  “It is the Debtors’ burden to present credible evidence that the provisions of the Plan are feasible and not in violation of applicable law,” the SEC said. The regulator also cited media reports that Binance is bracing itself to pay penalties for past infractions of money laundering and corruption law as evidence that the deal could become ""unfeasible"" and “impossible to consummate.""  The deal was also opposed by New York State’s Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) and Attorney General Letitia James in two Feb. 22 filings, including allegations that Voyager was unlawfully serving customers in the state.  “Despite the fact that none of the Debtors are licensed in New York, the Department is aware of allegations and other information indicating that one or more of the Debtors may have operated and may be continuing to operate in New York in violation of Applicable Law,” the NYDFS filing said.  Voyager “onboarded New York customers and thus illegally operated a virtual currency business within the state without a license, in violation of New York laws and regulations,” depriving its customers of protection, the filing added. The plan also discriminates against New Yorkers who won’t be able to reclaim their crypto for six months while Binance.US gains approval in the state, NYDFS said.  In January, the SEC filed a limited objection to the deal, saying there wasn’t enough detail to show Binance.US could afford it. The Federal Trade Commission has also indicated it is probing Voyager, which filed for bankruptcy protection in July, for deceptive marketing.  Voyager had previously argued that the Binance.US deal offers the best possible outcome for creditors, and that NYDFS objections are “hypocritical” because the regulators themselves are limiting the ability to distribute crypto.  Voyager creditors themselves had until 4 p.m. ET on Wednesday to approve the deal, and the company’s counsel has said that with a few hours of voting left the vast majority had done so.

Canto says it is a permissionless blockchain running the Ethereum Virtual Machine, and in its technical documents it states its three primitives - the Canto decentralized exchange, unit of account and lending market - are “public utility protocols, or Free Public Infrastructure.”  Sitting at 244 on Jan. 1, the number of unique wallet addresses that sent at least one on-chain transaction, jumped 10,965% to about 27,000 by Feb. 3, per Artemis. In the same time period, the total number of transactions registered on-chain in a rolling 24 hour period soared 4,858% from roughly 2,400 to 119,000.  Canto’s daily active addresses and transactions have dropped 89% to roughly 2,400 and 22,700, respectively, Artemis’ most recent data shows  While daily active addresses and transactions are still up on the year, the decline in the month for both figures demonstrate how the activity of the nascent network has cooled off.  Canto’s total value locked (TVL) is a different story, holding steady around $189 million with 65.82% of its TVL coming from the largest decentralized exchange on the blockchain, per TVL aggregator DeFiLlama. Canto’s TVL grew roughly 28% since the start of February and 182% since Jan. 1, highlighting how users are still interested in depositing their assets into the layer 1 blockchain even in times when activity has declined.  The interest in Canto may stem from its zero-fee DEX for liquidity providers.  Users use CANTO, the native token for the layer 1 blockchain network, to pay gas fees for transactions and to secure the network by being able to be staked. With an initial total supply of one billion tokens, the CANTO token’s price and market capitalization stand at $0.50 and $221 million, respectively, according to CoinGecko.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Sage D.

Currently, the service is available to token holders within the Fluf, Moonbirds, Kingship and Overlord communities. The curated playlists will be actively updated during the three-month testing period and can only be accessed by community members via a unique link.  Web3 gaming and media universe Overlord tweeted on Wednesday that holders of its lizard-themed Creepz NFT project can connect their Web3 wallet on Spotify to access the project's community-curated ""Invasion"" playlist.  Overlord tweeted that the pilot is currently only available for Android users in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Australia and New Zealand.  Spotify appeared to confirm the details in tweet reply.  Universal Music Group's NFT band KINGSHIP also shared that it had created a token-gated playlist for NFT holders featuring Queen, Missy Elliott, Snoop Dogg and Led Zeppelin.  Lead developer for NFT liquidity protocol NFTX Apoorv Lathey tweeted a screenshot from the pilot, showing step-by-step how to access KINGSHIP's curated playlist on Spotify.  According to the screenshot, NFT holders can connect to their MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Rainbow, Ledger Live or Zerion wallets.  A spokesperson for Spotify told CoinDesk that it ""routinely conducts a number of tests in an effort to improve our user experience.""  ""Some of those end up paving the path for our broader user experience and others serve only as important learnings,"" the spokesperson said.  Spotify did not provide additional details on plans to roll out the feature more broadly in the future.  The global streaming platform, which has over 489 million users, has previously experimented with integrating NFTs into its service.

42412800,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl6LXg,1677116025,First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Seesaws Above $24.1K Following Mixed FOMC Minutes,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin dropped near $23,600 following the release of less than encouraging minutes from the FOMC January meeting but rebounded along with other major cryptos later in the day.  Insights: Hundreds of fake ChatGPT tokens are luring crypto investors. The issuers of these tokens are looking to take advantage of the craze surrounding the this technology innovation.  Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 1,121 −7.1 ▼ 0.6% Bitcoin (BTC) $24,164 −233.3 ▼ 1.0% Ethereum (ETH) $1,641 −17.5 ▼ 1.1% S&P 500  3,991.05 −6.3 ▼ 0.2% Gold  $1,834 +1.3 ▲ 0.1% Nikkei 225  27,104.32 −368.8 ▼ 1.3% BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices, as of 7 a.m. ET (11 a.m. UTC)  Bitcoin Sinks Than Rallies Above $24.1K After FOMC Minutes  Stirred but not shaken, crypto markets dropped a little on Thursday, rose some but remained in the red after the U.S. central bank's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) released minutes that were short of encouraging.  Bitcoin was recently trading at $24,164, down 1% over the last 24 hours. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization dropped near $23,600 in the immediate aftermath of the FOMC report, which noted slowing growth – a boon for investors hoping for more dovish Federal Reserve monetary policy – but also data suggesting that inflation and the prospects of a harsh recession remained real, pleasing monetary hawks.  ""Everyone's wary of what's to come over the course of this year,"" Jake Boyle, chief commercial officer at crypto brokerage Caleb and Brown, said on CoinDesk TV. ""At this point it looks like the stance has become more conservative on the basis that 25 basis points is less impactful than 50, but it's critical that we all remember that it is still going up, which means that the solution is clearly not there.""  Boyle added: ""Paired with the regulatory uncertainty that the crypto space is seeming to have these days, it would be fair for us to make the assumption that there is going to be further volatility and unexpected announcements over the course of this year.""  Ether was recently changing hands at $1,641, off 1.1% from Tuesday, same time. Yet, CoinDesk analyst Glenn Williams noted that BTC and ETH were diverging on a different front, with investors sending bitcoin to exchanges and removing ether from them. The moves have signaled bearish sentiment for bitcoin and bullishness for ether, a departure from their usual correlation. Separately, on Tuesday layer 2 scaling system Arbitrum surpassed Ethereum in daily transactions, increasing Arbitrum’s dominance as the leading layer 2 rollup.  Other major cryptos were mixed with some ticking up a little but others slightly in the green, although APT, the token of layer 1 platform Aptos, recently climbed more than 6%.  Stocks fell amid the same inflationary and recessionary fears that have bedeviled markets for the past few days with the S&P 500, which has a tech-heavy component, dropping 0.2%, its fourth consecutive daily decline, and the technology-focused Nasdaq and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) also edging down slightly.  Crypto news ranged from upbeat to reminders of cryptos' nearly 15 months of sturm und drang. Investment banking giant JPMorgan said in a research report that crypto exchange Coinbase is well positioned to deliver notable year-on-year improvement in EBITDA."" But a legal filing by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission said it has started an investigation into bankrupt crypto lender Voyager Digital and its executives for deceptive marketing of cryptocurrency.  In an email to CoinDesk, Anthony Georgiades, co-founder of Pastel Network, a decentralized blockchain for non-fungible tokens, cryptocurrencies and Web3 technology, wrote optimistically that ""the slightly better than forecasted earnings reported by Coinbase might suggest that we have moved into the final innings of a crypto winter.""  ""Clearly, there has been more interest in the digital asset market in recent months, as evidenced by a rally that took a lot of observers by surprise. Part of this has to do with market psychology – everyone was so incredibly bearish that the obvious counter-trade was to be bullish. Coinbase has also been able to increase its overall market share on the back of the fallout of large crypto marketplaces like FTX.""  Georgiades was particularly sanguine about cryptos' prospects in Asia: ""There is a lot of speculation that buyers in Asia are starting to scale back into crypto in increasing amounts. As a result, the strength in the digital asset market may very well continue for the foreseeable future. Even if the Fed remains hawkish for months to come, what’s happening in other parts of the world in monetary easing might be enough to offset what’s happening in the United States.""  But he added that ""there could be deep pullbacks in bitcoin and crypto to come,"" even if ""the fodder for an enduring rally seems to be there.”  Insights  Hundreds of Fake ChatGPT Tokens Are Luring Crypto Investors; Majority Issued on BNB Chain  This story first appeared Feb. 21 on CoinDesk.  Nefarious market participants are attempting to cash in on the ongoing ChatGPT craze in technology circles by issuing fake tokens branded after the artificial intelligence chatbot despite having no official association with the tool.  Hundreds of such tokens have been issued in the past few weeks. Of this, 132 different tokens have been issued on BNB Chain, 25 tokens on Ethereum and 10 separate tokens on other blockchains such as Solana, Arbitrum, OKChain and Cronos.  These fake issuances follow software giant Microsoft’s move to integrate OpenAI’s chatbots for search services on Microsoft’s internet browsers.  While OpenAI is the creator of ChatGPT, Microsoft’s own chatbot is a bespoke tool and is said to be an improvement over the publicly accessible ChatGPT.  Scammers are not wasting a chance to monetize on the hype, however. Several “BingChatGPT” have been issued, seeded with liquidity and are seeing thousands of dollars in trading volumes – despite red flags.  “PeckShield has detected dozens of newly created #BingChatGPT tokens, of which 3 appear to be #honeypots & 2 have high sell tax,” blockchain security firm PeckShield said in a tweet Monday.  “2 of them have already dropped over -99%. Deployer 0xb583 has already created dozens of tokens with a pump & dump scheme,” PeckShield added, referring to the wallet address of the nefarious issuer of these tokens.  In cryptocurrency, honeypots are smart contracts that pretend to leak their funds to an arbitrary user, provided that the user sends additional funds to it.  On the other hand, sales tax refers to the intentional amount of money taken by an illicit smart contract when a related token is sold – usually amounts higher than 50%, meaning a user selling $100 worth of a token receives only $50 worth, with the remaining “taxed” amount going to the developer of that smart contact.  At writing time on Tuesday, there are over 170 ChatGPT-branded tokens issued on decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap and PancakeSwap, data from DEXTools shows.

A separate BNB Chain-version has $246,000 in liquidity and a market capitalization of $24 million.  Trading volumes on such fake tokens – and scams in some cases – are a glimpse of the crypto punting dream being alive and well.

Trading volumes and platform assets continued to drop. For now, shares remain a bet on how cryptocurrencies trade. After the bell on Tuesday, we received fourth quarter 2022 results from cryptocurrency platform Coinbase ( COIN ), which can be seen in this shareholder letter . Shares of the company were whacked last year as the crypto boom popped, sending revenues plunging as compared to prior year periods. While the quarterly report showed some near term progress, the future of the name still remains a bit murky. For Q4, total revenue of nearly $630 million beat street estimates by more than $40 million. However, this figure was down about 75% over Q4 2021 revenues, and it was just 51 weeks ago when the reported quarter's average analyst revenue estimate peaked at more than $2.2 billion. The graphic below shows how segment revenues have progressed over the past year, along with full year totals. Coinbase Q4 Revenue Segments (Company Shareholder Letter) As most investors know, trading volumes have collapsed as cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC-USD) have seen their prices plunge. Consumer trading volume in Q4 2022 was just $20 billion, as compared to $177 billion a year earlier. Institutional trading volumes were not down as much on a percentage basis, but still fell quite a bit, leading to the lower transaction revenues seen above. Total assets on the Coinbase platform also fell throughout 2022, going from $278 billion to $80 billion. Of that, there was an equal split between the consumer and institutional business at the end of last year. A significant amount of the asset losses were in the first half of 2022, but there was a $21 billion decline in Q4 after a $5 billion sequential rise in Q3. The main reason why Q4 revenues weren't so bad, however, was the major rise in interest income seen above. With interest rates continuing to rise throughout 2022, the company recorded higher interest income on customer fiat balances. However, Coinbase stated that $146 million of interest was also derived from US Coin (USDC-USD) as detailed in the explanation below. USDC Explanation (Q4 Shareholder Letter) While revenues did beat by quite a large margin, the company shifted to major loss territory last year. While beating street estimates by a nickel on a GAAP basis, the $2.46 per share loss equaled more than $557 million in total. That compares to an $840 million profit in the year ago period. Coinbase was able to bring its operating expenses down by about $400 million over Q4 2021 levels, but that obviously wasn't enough when revenues fell by more than $1.86 billion. Management guided to a lower sequential loss in Q1, but we're still talking about a few hundred million in net losses it appears. The company is looking to right size its expense base this year, especially as year over year revenues are still forecast to come down . Analysts don't see profitability on the near term horizon either, but as we've seen in the past, estimates can swing wildly from quarter to quarter. Coinbase still has a fairly healthy balance sheet. The company cited roughly $5.5 billion in USD resources, of which about 80% is cash and equivalents. There was a $148 million sequential decline in USD resources, but that wasn't as bad as a number of prior quarters. The major issue here is ongoing dilution, primarily through stock based compensation, which has sent the Class A (trading class) share count up by roughly 14 million shares in 2021 to nearly 183 million. The elephant in the room for 2023 is regulation. After some notable blowups in the crypto space last year, such as FTX (FTT-USD), we have bodies like the SEC looking to expand their jurisdiction. Obviously, Coinbase and other firms are pushing for fewer restrictions, but they are also just looking for guidance on what is and what is not accepted. Management in the shareholder letter pointed out the European Union's MiCA framework as potentially helping to pave the way for cryptocurrencies to realize their true value. Going into Tuesday's report, Coinbase shares closed a little over $62, which was a little more than $3 above the average price target on the street. The stock bounced around a bit in the after-hours session, finishing down about 1%, but was in the green for a while. Given the Q4 headline beats, we're likely to see analyst estimates come up a little and thus price targets could as well. Of course, let's not forget that just a year ago, the street saw this name worth nearly $350, and look where we are now. Of course, a bet on Coinbase this year is mostly a bet that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin will do well. If you believe that the Federal Reserve is going to pivot and become less restrictive, and that regulators won't push too hard, we could see a risk-on trade that helps this part of the market. Shares were above $87 earlier this month at their peak, so this is a stock that can rally very quickly, especially since it is highly shorted . On the flip side, a bunch of interest rate hikes, while they would help Coinbase's interest income, could easily send Bitcoin back below $20,000, and that likely sends Coinbase shares lower again. In the end, Coinbase's Q4 report did little to clear up the company's future. While headline results beat, primarily thanks to a surge in interest income, transaction volumes and assets on the platform did take a hit. Things have looked a little better so far in Q1, but the situation can easily turn on a dime. As has been the case since the company went public, a bet on this stock is basically a bet on the crypto space. For now, I'm not in favor of the name until it can get its expense base in order and until we see how much regulators want to crack down on this market segment after the FTX blowup.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4580877-coinbase-reports-mixed-q4-results?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/9805896.jpeg

Retail transaction volume came in a 9-quarter low. Monthly Transacting Users declined q/q and y/y to 8.3 million. Non-competitive take rate perhaps hurting volume. Company issues no guidance for FY 2023. The Quarter Coinbase ( COIN ) reported a very mixed quarter last night (February 21st). The conference call was similarly mixed. The big positive from the report was Q4 revenue that came in at $629 million versus consensus estimates that Bloomberg pegged at $581 million. That $48 million beat came almost entirely from higher than expected interest income of $182 million. Estimates I saw had largely pegged interest income at around $135 million. This revenue number fed through to a Q4 adjusted EBITDA loss of $124 million versus consensus of -$200 million. Some lower-than expected Tech and Development and G&A costs made up the rest of the EBITDA beat. I have to note that both line items were up versus Q3. That's the major extent of the good news here. Almost every other metric was bad. Retail Transaction Volume (the company's biggest revenue driver) was at a nine quarter low at just $20 billion, down 23% q/q, 89% y/y and below expectations. Total trading volume came in at $145 billion which was below expectations that Bloomberg pegged around $149 billion. MTU's (Monthly Transacting Users) and Assets on Platform also underwhelmed at 8.3 million and $80 billion respectively, down from 8.5 million and $101 billion respectively in the third quarter. Both consumer and institutional Assets on Platform declined from $51 billion to $40 billion. The major good news in my mind is that the retail take rate came in surprisingly high at 1.54%. This rate can be considered a mixed blessing, however. It certainly helps retail revenues, but I can't help but wonder if these high fees are driving away volume. I have believed that this company's take rate is so high that it risks making the platform uncompetitive versus other retail-oriented platforms. Too Much Uncertainty for Guidance There is so much volatility around crypto right now from both markets and political pressures that the company did not offer 2023 guidance beyond expected headcount after Q1, some Q1 ranges on subscription revenue ($300-$325 million) and expenses ($625 - $675 million tech and G&A expenses) and a goal of improving on 2022's $371 million adjusted EBITDA loss. The company also disclosed that January transaction revenue was $120 million, a run rate that is 12% over the fourth quarter. That is not surprising given the rally in crypto year to date, but similarly might imply either lower take rate or volumes or both. Count me unimpressed by this limited guidance, particularly given the valuation, the cash losses, the continued insanely high stock-based comp, and the ongoing uncertainty driven by crypto's volatility and the hostile political environment towards crypto and the moves by the SEC against profitable practices like staking. I just don't see why this company trades at over a $13 billion market cap or why it has rallied this year beyond rekindled enthusiasm for all things crypto and a short squeeze (and I'm not sure which is the chicken or the egg there). Risk The risk with playing this name (or any crypto name) is volatility and potential for short squeezes. As with MicroStrategy ( MSTR ), Marathon Digital ( MARA ) and other low-quality, highly-speculative crypto names, the bond market views this company in a far more harsh and realistic light than the equity market with the bonds in the high 50's to low 60's and sporting low-teen yields. I think this dynamic is due to amateur investors typically shying away from the bond market. It has been my experience that the bond market is usually right, but anything could happen. Conclusion I think this stock should trade materially lower. Frankly, given the bonds are so far below par that you could get equity like returns owning them, I don't see why anyone owns the stock over the bonds here unless they are just treating this stock as a pure trading vehicle or want a more volatile and more leveraged bet on bitcoin/altcoins. For anyone looking to short, the key is limiting your risk with either options or an acceptably sized stock short.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4580873-coinbase-low-quality-revenue-beat-cant-hide-bad-volumes-or-low-visibility?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/9805701.jpeg
