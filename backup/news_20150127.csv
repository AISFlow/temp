42398185,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSjOH,1422399942,Over 70 Bitcoin Scams Shut Down By New York Law Enforcement,"More than 70 websites promising unrealistically high returns on bitcoin investments have been shut down by the New York County District Attorney's office.  As originally reported by Bloomberg News, 73 sites were taken offline on 16th January by the office, including BitcoinHYIP.org and others owned by a company called YouYou Finance.  The defendants are accused of securities fraud and intent to commit fraud, as well as larceny charges, according to documents provided to CoinDesk. The investigator explained the background of his investigation into high-yield investment schemes based on bitcoin, as well as how the office went undercover and used the services.  The complaint read:  ""Defendant BITCOINHYIP.ORG represented both in its communications with me and on its website that it 'was [b]acked by a REAL company' and had a 'long history.'""  The office determined that BitcoinHYIP.org belonged to YouYou Finance, which owned dozens of other similar sites.  Investors targeted with high yield promise  The complaint, filed on 26th January, details how the district attorney's office first began looking into websites targeting bitcoin investors in July.  Notably, the document states that, in the case of investment schemes, bitcoin can be interpreted as acting as a type of security, arguing that ""by seeking investors willing to invest bitcoins...these websites were using bitcoins as a security.""  As part of its investigation into BitcoinHYIP.org, investigators went undercover and deposited 1 BTC with the website in August. The complaint notes that the defendants, prior to the payment, assured investigators that their investments were safe and their returns guaranteed.  The filing continues:  ""Thereafter, defendants BITCOINHYIP.ORG and YOUYOU FINANCE failed to and refused to transmit the promised investment return of three bitcoins, instantly or otherwise, or to return the bitcoin that I originally transmitted to them. That refusal has continued to the present.""  Other elements of the report include a blockchain data analysis suggesting that bitcoins sent to the websites were never returned to their originating addresses.

42398175,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSjGP,1422396017,Bitcoin Broker Anycoin Direct Raises €500k in Seed Funding,"Anycoin Direct has raised €500,000 as part of a seed round backed by a private investor.  The Netherlands-based bitcoin brokerage announced the deal on 21st January, a move that coincided with its expansion to the Canadian market. Anycoin Direct offers users the ability to buy and sell digital currencies including bitcoin, dogecoin and darkcoin, among others.  Speaking to CoinDesk, co-founder Lennert Vlemmings indicated that the funding will allow Anycoin Direct to expand to more countries while adding support for new payment methods and increased development.  Still, Vlemmings was tight-lipped about what might be included as part of the company’s plans for 2015, stating:  ""We have a lot of things the funding allows us to do – most we cannot talk about right now – but we do have plans for specific countries and payment methods we’re going to introduce in the short term.""  Vlemmings and co-founder Bram Ceelen suggested that Canada was selected as a target market for the company due to the similarities between its payments systems and those in Europe. Anycoin Direct users in this market can now use the INTERAC online bill payment service to make digital currency purchases.  Anycoin Direct previously announced in September that it would expand its services to more European countries. The service is now available in 14 countries including Austria, Italy and Portugal.

42398172,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSjHO,1422392102,Citi Digital Chief: Bitcoin's Economics Are Flawed,"Bitcoin isn't mature enough for mass adoption and its economics are inherently flawed, Citi's head of digital strategy, Greg Baxter, said at a London event on digital money sponsored by the global bank.  ""If you take [the value of] all bitcoin transactions last year, we did that in three hours of trading [on a Citi forex trading platform]. So I think the maturity of it – I don't think it's quite there yet,"" Baxter said.  Baxter pointed to bitcoin miners dropping out of the network as evidence that the cryptocurrency's economics failed to ""stack up"". He was building on an earlier point that technology innovators should focus their efforts on the ""core"" of the existing financial system, rather than its periphery.  He said:  ""The real game is using digital to transform the core of our industry. [Existing platforms] are low cost, they're regulated, they're trusted – why wouldn't you want to innovate on top of this platform?""  Centralised platforms are more efficient  Baxter spoke as part of a panel moderated by FT Alphaville blogger Izabella Kaminska that included former Bitcoin Foundation director Jon Matonis; Bob Ferguson, head of the Financial Conduct Authority's Policy, Risk & Research Division; and Giles Andrews, co-founder of peer-to-peer lending company Zopa.  Matonis agreed that centralised platforms would often be more efficient than decentralised systems like bitcoin, although he said the economics of using bitcoin would change if the amount of commerce going through the blockchain increased sufficiently.  ""In a majority of use cases the centralised system is going to be far more efficient in doing a lot of things,"" Matonis said. ""The thing about distributed blockchain technology is you have to determine why you need it ... transaction fees will replace miner rewards if there is sufficient commerce riding across the blockchain.""  Ferguson stressed that his organisation remains neutral on emerging technologies and that the regulatory regime for cryptocurrencies in the UK is still being shaped.  ""In the UK, they might be regulated for AML purposes, or they might not be regulated at all,"" he said. ""We just have to wait and see.""  Banking system isn't 'fit for purpose'  Ferguson seemed to largely agree with Citi's Baxter on the point that the existing financial system would adapt to changing consumer needs and emerging technologies.  He said  ""I don't think banks are doomed to obsolescence, I think they will be able to adjust over time. They have legacy systems so they can't transform themselves overnight ... I think we'll see innovation rather than extinction.""  Andrews took issue with the idea that the existing banking system is sufficient for consumer needs. He also lauded the potential of the blockchain as a technology that could change the way banks themselves are run.  ""What can the blockchain do to banking's core system? Building on what's there and what works is a laudable aim, but so much of banking is simply broken,"" he said. ""I think many would argue it's not fit for purpose anymore.""  Kaminska repeated several critiques she has made about bitcoin on her Alphaville blog. She questioned the economics of the blockchain, saying that many costs, including transaction costs, were currently ""disguised"". Kaminska also argued that bitcoin isn't quite as revolutionary as its supporters claim.  Closing the panel discussion, she said:  ""On Twitter I never get the last word with Jon [Matonis] ... Whenever I speak to central bankers who are interested in this area, when it comes to a decentralised ledger, they say, 'We've already got that. It's called the banking system ... we get the banks to [confirm transactions] for us, they're the miners'. So Citi, you're a miner already.""",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Joon Ian Wong,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/01/27/citi-digital-chief-bitcoins-economics-are-flawed,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7eefca0120dada5178a646affbd2509ff828d2b4-2560x1920.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42398179,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSjLK,1422387630,"Spark Capital, Aleph Lead $2.5 Million Investment in Colored Coins Startup Colu","Crypto 2.0 startup Colu has raised $2.5m as part of a seed funding round with which it seeks to advance the development of the colored coins concept.  Led by VC firms Aleph and Spark Capital, contributing investors also included VC Barry Silbert’s Bitcoin Opportunity Corp and boutique angel fund Box Group. Notably, Spark Capital’s past investments include now-famous tech startups such as Foursquare, Tumblr and Twitter, as well as fashion startup Warby Parker.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Colu framed its project as one that would strive to find everyday use cases for the more advanced applications of bitcoin’s blockchain as a record-keeping tool for online identity and the Internet of Things.  For example, co-founder and CEO Amos Meiri indicated that Colu’s first application will focus on using bitcoin tokens as a form of two-factor authentication, but that the company will more broadly seek to uncover new use cases for cryptographic tokens.  Meiri further sought to position Colu as a market leader in the crypto 2.0 space owing to the status of its assembled investors, stating:  “This is the first time that blue chip investors have invested in 2.0. That gives a lot of confidence to big companies that want to integrate with the technologies.”  The nine-member team has been focusing on development to date, but aims to use the funds to improve its business prospects. Meiri indicated that Colu will now seek to find partner companies, while growing its team to 12 members.  Overall, investors such as Aleph's Eden Shochat expressed enthusiasm at the potential for both Colu and colored coins technology.  ""If anything, the issue with colored coins is it has too many exciting opportunities, not even just a single focus,"" Shochat said.  The investment is also one of the first from major VC firms in foundational crypto 2.0 technology, as similar projects in the ecosystem have largely relied on bitcoin-enabled crowdfunding.  From art to ticketing  Crucial to encouraging the wider of use of colored coins, Meiri contends is that Colu’s technology appeals to developers. This means investing in creating simple APIs and software development kits (SDKs) that allow companies to tap into bitcoin’s capabilities.  Overall, Meiri framed Colu as a Chain for colored coins, comparing his startup to the bitcoin API developer that received $9.5m in a funding round this August.  In addition to a bitcoin-based social authentication alternative, Meiri said Colu is already talking with companies that are seeking to build more specific applications of the technology without the need to become experts in the specifics of bitcoin technology.  “One example is an art app that wants to issue tokens to certificate art and have it be tradeable,” Meiri explained. “We want people to use 2.0 technology without even knowing they’re using bitcoin.”  Other examples he cited included using tokens for ticketing and as access mechanisms for connected devices.  Close to market  Shochat framed his firm's investment in Colu as the first step in what has been a long discovery process, though one that he expects to bear fruit soon.  ""We’ve been tracking a few teams that are doing colored coin work, but Amos’ team got us to buy into their focus on using the technology as an access layer as opposed to a generic platform,"" Shochat said.  While Shochat suggested that many of the more exciting opportunities colored coins and cryptographic tokens can unlock are years away, he expects initial applications to launch in the short term.  ""The initial applications are very close to what we’re seeing today,"" he said. ""It's a period of months, not years.""  Shochat added that his firm is increasingly interested in 2.0 technology as it has fewer regulatory issues, though he said his firm is still interested in the financial applications of bitcoin and blockchain technology.  He went on to cite selling tokens as access to networks or as part of crowdfunding campaigns as applications in which he is personally most interested.  Putting tech first  Meiri also sought to position the funding as evidence that the concept of colored coins, while one of the oldest in the crypto 2.0 space, can still compete with newer entrants.  Like a number of projects including the more recently prominent Counterparty and Ethereum, colored coins use the bitcoin blockchain as a transfer mechanism. While projects like Counterparty or Omni have issued new coins on the bitcoin protocol to achieve this end, colored coins is a layer that augments bitcoins to signify specific assets.  Alongside Colu’s lead developer, Meiri is also a leading influence behind the recently relaunched Colored Coins foundation, a membership body representing startups experimenting with the technology including ChromaWallet, CoinPrism and CoinSpark.  Meiri said that while Colu has ambitious mainstream goals, the project’s first priority will be to ensure that the colored coins ecosystem can continue its drive toward interoperability.  “First we want to get colored coins back up on its feet. We want to have a standard for colored coins,” Meiri said.  The Colored Coins foundation expects to publish its standard in the coming months.

42398166,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSj9W,1422380542,Green Activist is First Mainstream UK Politician to Accept Bitcoin,"An eco-activist from London has become the first mainstream political candidate to accept bitcoin in the UK.  Gulnar Hasnain  , who is standing as the Green Party’s candidate for the inner-city borough of Vauxhall, is crowdfunding support for her parliamentary campaign ahead of the UK's general election next May.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Hasnain said she hopes to draw attention to the positive aspects of blockchain technology and its potential to ""transform democracy worldwide"".  She added:  ""Surprisingly, the Green Party is vocal on the same issues as the bitcoin movement – more decentralised power, smaller government, a need for a shift in the concentration of power in the banking system and a more inclusive society.""  Rather than corporate donors, the £1,000 Hasnain hopes to raise will come from individuals using Onename and social tipping tool ChangeTip, alongside fiat contributions via the website Crowdfunder.  At press time, she had already received her first bitcoin tip from Coinjar's UK lead, Lúí Smyth.  Green growth  The Greens  have received mixed reactions from the country's media for their policies on localism, sustainability and welfare reform. However, Hasnain's party – now the fourth biggest in the UK – is growing rapidly, particularly in London, where one fifth of its near-50,000 members reside.  Hasnain will likely seek to tap into this newfound support to defeat Labour MP Kate Hoey, who has represented Vauxhall in the House of Commons since 1989.  Prior to campaigning, Hasnain cut her teeth as head of environment and sustainability strategy for London Mayor Boris Johnson's Economic Development Agency, focusing on urban regeneration and clean technologies. More recently, she co-founded the bitcoin-focused Coinsummit conference series with partner Pamir Gelenbe.  Although there are ""pockets of interest"" in digital currency among the Greens, Hasnain's decision to accept bitcoin was a result of her experience with the conference, she said, which connected investors and startups working in the space.  Technology for change  Startup culture is something Hasnain hopes to recreate in her future constituency, she said, citing the creativity and drive of its large youth population. ""I can envisage many young digital currency entrepreneurs emerging from the area,"" she added.  However, Vauxhall, which Hasnain described as one of the most ""exciting, diverse, and vibrant"" areas in the capital has it's share of problems: ""Famous landmarks such as the London Eye ... sit side by side with some of the most deprived areas of London.""  According to Hasnain, bitcoin has the capacity to change this, by tackling banking exclusion and high fees as a more cost-effective way to store and transfer money.  The remittance applications of the technology make it highly attractive for the borough's diverse communities too, she added.  Bitcoin in Westminster  Following George Osborne's announcement that the government would seek to evaluate the potential of digital currency last August, a handful of UK MPs have come forward to comment publicly on the emerging technology.  While Treasury Select Committee member Steve Baker insists bitcoin doesn't need new legislation, others, including Chi Onwurah, the UK's shadow cabinet minister for digital government, say consumer protections in the space are currently inadequate.  On the topic of regulation, Hasnain says she is concerned that a heavy hand may stifle innovation, but agrees that the industry must do better to educate new users:  ""I do think the industry has a responsibility to make consumers aware of the risks involved in using bitcoin and bitcoin exchanges. I think the sector and the Bitcoin Foundation have made a great start, but we now need to go further to raise awareness amongst the wider population.""",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Grace Caffyn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/01/27/green-activist-is-first-mainstream-uk-politician-to-accept-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7e5e127e5cf52316ba5ddb5464288e65fa206fdd-1570x967.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

CoinTerra has between $10m and $50m in assets, with liabilities within the same range, according to court documents. The firm has filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection, meaning it is likely to liquidate all assets in its bid to repay secured creditors.  CoinTerra stated that it would be unable to repay unsecured investors and named hundreds of creditors in its filing, which was submitted on 24th January.  The move comes soon after CoinTerra became the target of a lawsuit launched by C7 Data Centers, a data center colocation services provider based in Utah. C7 is seeking repayment on roughly $1.4m in unpaid service fees, as well as nearly $4m in damages. Indications that the company was experiencing debt problems first emerged earlier this month.  C7 is among those named in an extensive list of creditors, which includes US-based bank Wells Fargo and data services provider CenturyLink, the latter of which entered into an agreement with Cointerra in July of last year.  The list features a number of private citizens from both the US and abroad, as well as a number of companies that did business with the Austin, Texas, based mining startup.  CoinTerra's website features a brief acknowledgement of the bankruptcy, referring users to the bankruptcy case filing and the website for the US bankruptcy court in Texas's Western District. A creditor meeting has been scheduled for 27th February, according to the filing.  The Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing suggests that negotiations between CoinTerra and its list of creditors did not result in a solution that would see the company continuing to operate.  In a recent interview, CoinTerra CEO Ravi Iyengar said that the firm's future hinged on the outcome of those discussions.
