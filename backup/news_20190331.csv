42430363,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMrihh,1554037236,Up 100%: Litecoin Price Sets Q1 Performance Record,"Litecoin's (LTC) price has doubled in the first three months of 2019 to register its best first-quarter performance on record.  The fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is currently trading at $61, representing a 100 percent gain on January's opening price of $30. It clocked a six-month high of $64.20 earlier this month, according to Bitfinex data.  Last year, prices had dropped 48.5, 30, 24.6 and 49 percent in each quarter, respectively. The four-quarter losing streak was the second largest on record and saw prices fall by 86 percent.  As can be seen, LTC's 100 percent rise in Q1, 2019, is the biggest first-quarter gain on record.  This the second time that LTC has appreciated in the first three months of the calendar year. The cryptocurrency last rallied in Q1 two years ago.  The stellar gains seen in the first quarter of 2019 could be associated with the mining reward halving, due later this year.  On Aug. 8, the reward for mining on the litecoin blockchain will be reduced from 25 LTC to 12.5 LTC. The shift means miners will be adding fewer coins to the ecosystem after August, possibly leading to supply deficit.  The process is repeated every four years and tends to put a bid under the cryptocurrency at least six to seven months in advance, according to historical data.  For instance, LTC created a long-term low near $1.12 in January 2015 and rose to highs above $8.70 in July before falling back below $4.00 ahead of Aug. 25 – a day when the mining reward was cut in half from 50 to 25 LTC.  With bitcoin rallying 100 percent in Q1, history seems to be repeating itself. So, LTC could rise even further in the second quarter, albeit after a pullback, as technical charts are showing signs of bullish exhaustion.  Daily and weekly charts  On the daily chart, the relative strength index (RSI) has created a series of lower highs as opposed to higher highs in price. That bearish divergence on the RSI indicates buyer exhaustion and scope for a pullback, possibly to immediate support at $53.00 (March 12 low).  Acceptance below that level would confirm a short-term bearish reversal and open the doors to $45.00, which marks the confluence of the 200-day and 200-week moving average (MA).  On the higher side, a high-volume move above the recent high of $64.20 would revive the bullish view, although that looks unlikely for now, as the longer duration MA studies are still biased bearish.  Monthly charts  LTC seems to have found acceptance above the 10-month MA, currently at $53.60. The average, however, is still trending south, indicating a bearish setup. As a result, further gains, if any, could be short-lived and a sustained rally will likely unfold once the average has bottomed out.  Validating that argument is the fact that LTC consolidated around the 10-month MA for almost a year before entering the bull market in Q1 2017.

42430354,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMriPh,1554026441,Iran's Crypto Regulations: What's Happening Behind Closed Doors,"Under pressure for being months behind schedule, the Central Bank of Iran finally published a draft framework on the legality of cryptocurrencies in late January and welcomed feedback.  While some see the totality of the framework as a step forward, most members of the burgeoning local crypto community are unhappy with much of the specifics. They feel that the framework could severely restrict people and businesses operating in the fast-growing field if it is implemented in its current form.  Among other things, the framework proposes banning the use of global cryptocurrencies and various tokens as methods of domestic payment; requires cryptocurrency exchanges to obtain permits, therefore opening a new avenue for rent-seeking in a country that has already too much of it; and uses the word “forbidden” a lot, which could entail the threat of criminal prosecution.  So, the local community quickly started working on ways to improve it.  On March 9, more than three dozen members of the community sent their proposals to the central bank in the form of a joint document that found 51 problems in the regulator’s 13-page draft framework.  However, at least for now, there isn’t much else they can do. The fate of their existing businesses, budding ideas and passion for decentralization is mostly in the hands of larger and immensely complicated centralized power structures.  The sanctions question  That this is occurring is because money has transformed into a security issue in Iran.  Iranian President Hassan Rouhani’s government in early April 2018 “unified” the country’s dual foreign exchange rates in a bid to buoy a national currency sharply declining due to fears of returning U.S. sanctions. Within days, the central bank was directed to implement a blanket ban on cryptocurrencies at the behest of the government in a misguided effort to prevent further capital flight.  In early May, President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers and reimposed “the toughest sanctions ever” against the Islamic Republic. This only exacerbated a currency crisis in Iran and led to the rial hitting several consecutive all-time lows in the ensuing months.  Moreover, dozens of currency traders were arrested and sentenced to lengthy prison terms and hefty fines while several high-level financial offenders, including a man dubbed the “Sultan of Coins” due to his hoarding of gold coins, were executed.  On the other hand, Iranian authorities see an opportunity in cryptocurrencies due to its potential to challenge exertion of extraterritorial restrictions. Be that as it may, people actually working on ongoing local projects know they can’t – and are not designed to – circumvent sanctions.  Rouhani has personally attended several top-level meetings on cryptocurrencies, the central bank is establishing a sovereign rial-backed cryptocurrency to expand digital banking operations and Iran’s top banks have launched a gold-backed cryptocurrency to sell their bad assets and generate liquidity.  Regulatory challenges  Against this backdrop, any entity that has remotely anything to do with cryptocurrencies – as many as 28 – wants to have a hand in the action. After the central bank, the next major entities include the Securities and Exchange Organization, the High Council of Cyberspace, the Ministry of ICT, the parliament, the Ministry of Industry, Mine and Trade, the Ministry of Energy and the Customs Administration.  It is worth noting that those entities belong to different, sometimes rivaling factions and each has their own opinions about how or whether cryptocurrencies should be regulated.  In recent months, there have been talks that the cabinet may have the final say on passing cryptocurrency regulations. If that happens, it could be a simplifying factor in that it could block many of the lower-level entities from trying to have a finger in the pie. But at the same time, it chips away at the central bank’s authority and highlights the independence it so desperately needs.  The fact that so many entities are trying to have a say about cryptocurrency regulations does not negate the central bank’s restrictive capabilities, but it affects its ability to legalize or otherwise support activities in this field, believes Saeed Khoshbakht, CEO of Tehran-based distributed ledger technology solutions firm Areatak.  “In other words, we have one rule: everyone needs to be onboard for something to be implemented, whereas only one needs to be opposed to stop a motion,” Khoshbakht, who acted as an advisor for the central bank-affiliated Informatics Services Corporation concerning the regulatory framework, told CoinDesk.  He thinks Iran’s cryptocurrency community needs to learn to lobby – “in its positive sense” – since it currently has no effective links to any of the deciding entities.  That, he said, could include working toward enacting constructive regulations, alleviating concerns felt by law enforcement and judiciary, and supporting government entities when necessary.  ""Ultimately, I believe the central bank is Iran’s best bet for regulating cryptocurrencies,"" Khoshbakht said. ""If making decisions for this area gets out of the central bank’s hands for any reason, including mistakes on the community’s part, I think the situation could become much more difficult.""
