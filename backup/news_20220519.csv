42374689,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw1uhP,1653003048,First Mover Asia: KuCoin Plans to Bolster DeFi Activity on Its Blockchain After $150M Raise; Cryptos Gain,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin recovers somewhat; most other cryptos are in the green.  Insights: KuCoin will use part of its $150 million capital raise to increase DeFi activity on its blockchain.  Technician's take: BTC appears oversold, although trading conditions have been choppy over the past few days.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis. And sign up for First Mover,our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $30,185 +4.4%  Ether (ETH): 2,011 +3.6%  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Internet Computer ICP +5.4% Computing Litecoin LTC +4.9% Currency Cosmos ATOM +4.2% Smart Contract Platform  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Algorand ALGO −1.9% Smart Contract Platform Stellar XLM −1.8% Smart Contract Platform  Bitcoin posts a small recovery  As improvement goes, bitcoin didn't have much to crow about on Thursday. The largest cryptocurrency was still struggling to remain above $30,000, and well off where it was trading as little as two weeks ago.  But the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization did a little better than ether and other major altcoins.  Bitcoin was recently changing hands at around $30,200, up more than 4.4% over the past 24 hours. The increase outperformed ether, which rose a little more than 3.5% during the same period, and other cryptos, most of which also registered smaller gains as investors continued to prefer the best-known digital asset over smaller, riskier ones. XRP, SOL, ADA and MATIC rose less than a percentage point. AVAX was among the losers, recently dropping more than 3%.  Still, the flavor of the market remained sour with investors continuing to chew on the triple whammy of inflationary pressures, central bank missteps and the looming prospect of recession. Altcoins have largely trailed bitcoin amid the mushrooming economic uncertainty in recent months. For the past 90 days, only 15% of the top 50 altcoins have outperformed bitcoin, according to the Blockchain Center, a provider of crypto data. The trend reflects the current risk-off environment.  Gold, a traditionally safe haven for risk-averse investors, rose by more than a percentage point.  Equity markets? They fared a little worse than cryptos but improved on their previous day's bloodbath. The S&P 500 fell by less than a percentage point after finishing Wednesday with its largest percentage decline since June 2020. The index's 18% tumble from its most recent high remains perilously close to the 20% drop that merits bear market designation. The tech-heavy Nasdaq, which reached bear market status earlier this year, fell slightly on Thursday.  Stocks' big plunge on Wednesday reflected disappointing first quarter sales by retail giants Target (TGT) and Walmart (WMT). On Thursday, Kohl's (KSS), the largest department store chain by number of locations, added to the retail sector's woes with its own downbeat report and provided the latest evidence of inflation's growing impact on consumer spending. Meanwhile, U.S. home sales fell last month, a sign that higher mortgage rates triggered by the U.S. Federal Reserve's more hawkish monetary policy, along with record high prices, was slowing the once hot-housing market.  ""Results from Walmart and Target this week have brought into sharp focus the plight facing companies and consumers as inflation begins to bite,"" Oanda Senior Market Analyst, U.K. & EMEA, Craig Erlam wrote in an email. ""Inflation is catching up and profit margins are taking a hit. Soon enough, though, those higher costs will be passed on and consumers will start being more careful with their spending. There's a feeling of inevitability about the economy, the question is whether we're going to see a slowdown or a recession.""  Yet, Erlam struck a positive note about bitcoin remaining at the $30,000 level. Bitcoin is holding up surprisingly well against the backdrop of pessimism in the markets,"" Erlam wrote. ""Perhaps because it's fueled by economic concern rather than simply interest rates.""  He added: ""Whether it can continue to swim against the sentiment tide, time will tell.""  Markets  S&P 500: 3,900 -0.5%  DJIA: 31,253 -0.7%  Nasdaq: 11,388 -0.2%  Gold: 1,842 +1.4%  Insights  KuCoin to increase DeFi activity  Seychelles-based crypto exchange KuCoin will devote part of its recent $150 million raise to expand technical features and support developers building on the KuCoin Community Chain (KCC), a public blockchain, the firm told CoinDesk.  “We know the difficulties and obstacles that developer teams have in their initial stage of development,” a spokesperson for KuCoin said. “Therefore, we will devote more resources to discovering and supporting high-quality developers and early innovative projects.”  KuCoin did not provide the exact figures it would use to encourage developer growth. However, KCC will move to a cross-chain model that supports applications from multiple blockchains and build a layer 2 system that allows for faster transactions at a lower fee. Layer 2 refers to a secondary protocol built on top of an existing network  Funding development efforts could help bolster falling demand for KCC. Data from explorers show Thursday saw just 19,000 transactions on the network compared to over 60,000 in early May.  The move is similar to developer funds raised by the likes of crypto projects Fantom, Near and Avalanche in the past year to encourage activity on their blockchain and the building of newer decentralized applications (dapps). Fantom committed $315 million, Near raised $350 million, while Avalanche launched a $220 million ""crypto growth"" fund.  KuCoin is the fifth-largest crypto exchange by trading volume, CoinGecko data shows. The firm saw a 1,503% year-over-year growth in new users from Asia, who made up a large part of its daily trading volume.  The exchange raised $150 million earlier this month at a valuation of $10 billion in a round led by Jump Crypto.  Technician's take  Bitcoin Returns Above $30K, Resistance at $35K  Bitcoin (BTC) held short-term support above $27,500 as buyers reacted to oversold conditions on the charts. The cryptocurrency could face resistance at $35,000, which is where the current downtrend accelerated earlier this month.  BTC briefly traded above $30,000 during the New York trading day and was up by as much as 3% over the past 24 hours.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart is rising from oversold levels, which could keep short-term buyers active. Further, short-term momentum is improving, similar to what occurred in early March, which preceded a brief relief rally in price.  A countertrend reversal signal, per the DeMARK indicators, appeared on BTC's daily chart on May 12 alongside major equity indices. That suggests a relief rally in speculative assets could delay additional breakdowns in price.  Still, BTC will need to register a weekly close above $30,000 (and above 4,000 for the S&P 500) to confirm short-term bullish signals. For now, upside appears to be limited because of negative momentum signals on the weekly and monthly charts.

Officials with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) allege Sam Ikkurty (also known as Sreenivas I Rao), of Portland, Ore., and Ravishankar Avadhanam of Aurora, Ill., as well as several corporate entities controlled by the defendants, worked together to convince their victims to invest in a “so-called income fund invested in digital assets.”  The defendants have also been charged with operating an illegal commodity pool and failing to register as a Commodity Pool Operator with the CFTC.  Beginning in 2017, Ikkurty and Avadhanam allegedly told would-be investors in Ikkurty Capital, Rose City Income Fund and Seneca Ventures that the pair would use their funds to invest in various cryptocurrencies, promising very high returns – some as high as 62% annually. According to the complaint, the pair advertised via a website as well as videos posted on YouTube.  Instead, the CFTC said, Ikkurty and Avadhanam pooled the investor funds and “distributed the majority of those funds as profits to other participants in a manner akin to a Ponzi scheme.”  Additionally, the CFTC said Ikkurty and Avadhanam kept $18 million for themselves, transferring the funds to “other participants” and off-shore entities under their control.  A federal court in Illinois has issued a restraining order that freezes the assets in question, preserves documents relating to the alleged scheme, and appoints a receiver for investor funds.

""Given the proposed Terra chain fork, LFG has disclosed no plans to use the AVAX,"" according to the tweet. “Should any sales be contemplated for the LFG reserves, the Avalanche Foundation is ready to work with LFG on a sensible trading strategy.”  With the token's price fluctuating at $30 per token, the market value of the AVAX stash is about $60 million, making it the second-largest holding in LFG’s dwindling $240 million treasury.  Avalanche said in the tweet that it provided the update because ""some members of the Avalanche Community have inquired about details around the $AVAX reserves.""  Crypto traders have speculated on what the plans were for the AVAX tokens – and what the market impact might be from any sales.  The announcement comes as entities with strong ties to the Terra ecosystem, including the $8 billion layer 1 blockchain Avalanche, are facing demands for transparency from the community as they reckon with the market events of last week.  Additionally, Avalanche revealed Terra blockchain developer Terraform Labs (TFL), holds 1.1 million AVAX tokens in another tweet.  TFL’s tokens are subject to a one-year lock up, according to the tweet.  The AVAX tokens held by TFL and LFG represented 0.5% and 0.9% of the token’s weekly volume, according to Avalanche.  ""The AVAX is currently immobilized,"" according to the tweet.  CoinDesk reported in April that the Luna Foundation Guard and Terraform Labs – both organizations supporting the Terra blockchain – announced they had collectively acquired $200 million worth of Avalanche’s AVAX tokens from the Avalanche Foundation.  In exchange, the Avalanche Foundation received $100 million worth of LUNA from Terraform Labs and $100 million worth of the stablecoin UST from Luna Foundation Guard.  As of Thursday afternoon, LUNA was trading at less than 1 cent and UST at 8 cents, marking a dramatic decline in the tokens’ value.

Coinbase also told employees it will give them more stock grants to offset half the difference between ones made earlier this year and Coinbase’s closing share price last Friday, according to The Information’s report.  One of the emails discussed plans to reduce spending on cloud services such as Amazon Web Services and Datadog, and also cutting gas fees on internal wallet transfers, according to the Information.  On Thursday afternoon ET, Coinbase Chief Product Officer Surojit Chatterjee shared a tweet thread describing what was mentioned in one of the emails cited by The Information.  The report follows Coinbase’s blog earlier this week in which Chief Operating Officer Emilie Choi said the company is “slowing hiring so we can reprioritize our hiring needs against our highest-priority business goals.” The move is a departure from Coinbase’s plan to triple its headcount earlier this year, as reported.  In its first-quarter earnings report, Coinbase reported lower-than-expected revenues, and a quarterly net loss of $430 million, compared with a profit of $840 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. The company said it expected about $1.7 billion of stock-based compensation expenses, up from $1.5 billion previously, citing “hiring trends and year-to-date acquisitions.”  Coinbase ended Q1 with 4,948 full-time employees, up 33% versus the fourth quarter of 2021. Over the past twelve months, Coinbase also said in its first-quarter report that the company added over 3,200 net new employees.  Shares of Coinbase have fallen over 70% this year.  Coinbase declined to comment regarding The Information's report.

42374672,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw1uNH,1652996855,Former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes Faces 6 to 12 Months in Jail at Sentencing Hearing Friday,"Former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes is set to face sentencing in a federal courthouse in New York on Friday after pleading guilty in February to charges that he willfully failed to implement an anti-money laundering (AML) program at the exchange.  Prosecutors say the lack of know-your-customer (KYC) requirements at BitMEX allowed the company to thrive as a hotbed for criminal activity, including money laundering and sanctions evasion.  Hayes and his BitMEX co-founders, Samuel Reed and Ben Delo, as well as the company’s first employee, Gregory Dwyer, were initially charged in October 2020 with one count each of violating the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), and another of conspiring to do so.  The four men, as well as BitMEX and other corporate entities, also faced civil suits from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) that resulted in monetary penalties. BitMEX was ordered to pay the regulators $100 million; Hayes, Reed, and Delo had to fork over $10 million each.  The criminal charges carry a maximum sentence of five years each, but Hayes’ plea deal with prosecutors reduced the sentencing guidelines to between six and 12 months. He will be sentenced at the U.S. District Court for the Southern District in downtown Manhattan.  Hayes, a U.S. citizen and longtime resident of Singapore, surrendered to U.S. authorities in Hawaii last April, in a deal brokered between his lawyers and federal prosecutors. He was released on a $10 million bond secured by $1 million in cash and co-signed by his mother.  Two sides of the story  In a 65-page sentencing memo submitted to the court on May 4, Hayes’ lawyers asked the judge for leniency: probation, with no jail time or house arrest. They also requested that Hayes maintain his freedom to travel internationally and live abroad.  The submission also included a letter from his mother. Hayes’ lawyers argued that the former BitMEX CEO’s life had already been upended by the charges, which they said had “an extraordinary and well-publicized impact on Mr. Hayes’ personal life and on the BitMEX business that he co-founded.”  They also argued that Hayes is unlikely to reoffend.  The government, however, sees things differently. In a sentencing memo submitted on May 12, prosecutors asked the judge to hand down “a significant sentence of incarceration, above the applicable Sentencing Guidelines range of [six] to 12 months.”  Prosecutors say Hayes flaunted BitMEX’s disregard for KYC and AML guidelines, advertising the company’s lack of compliance on the exchanges’ website and in blog posts and media interviews.  This, prosecutors say, attracted “precisely the bad actors which the BSA intends to deter” – and earned Hayes over $100 million.  Hayes’ prominence in the crypto community and his penchant for talking to journalists about his worldview (and his glamorous life on the lam) seems to be a sore spot for prosecutors:  “The defendant chose to use his influence to promote a vision for the crypto industry that was in direct contradiction to the law, and calculated to undermine government regulations,” prosecutors wrote. “The defendant routinely criticized and mocked KYC requirements, and made it clear that he had no interest in complying with them.”",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | FIAT | REGULATION,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/05/19/former-bitmex-ceo-arthur-hayes-faces-6-to-12-months-in-jail-at-sentencing-hearing-friday,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c4c9ed2457de90d2b7fa7a03492d704a6484bce5-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The attackers went on to spread a Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt about alleged bank runs and peg manipulations. Later on, the alleged attacker dumped the $3 Billion worth of BTC, which went on to trigger a worldwide panic across the crypto industry.

Most cryptocurrencies appear to be stabilizing alongside stocks, which indicates a pause in bearish sentiment among traders. Some technical indicators applied to BTC and the S&P 500 remain in oversold territory, although long-term charts suggest limited upside from here.  Some alternative cryptos (altcoins) rallied on Tuesday, albeit within a six-month downtrend. For example, Solana's SOL token rose by as much as 2% over the past 24 hours, compared with a 3% rise in BTC over the same period. Still, SOL is down by 50% over the past month, compared with a 35% drop in ether (ETH) and a 27% decline in BTC.  Just launched!

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Bitcoin's relative strength  Bitcoin has been outperforming other cryptos over the past few months, which indicates a lower appetite for risk among traders.  Typically, bitcoin declines less than altcoins in a down market because of its lower risk profile relative to smaller tokens. The opposite is true in a rising market.  Only 15% of the top 50 altcoins have performed better than bitcoin over the past 90 days, according to the Blockchain Center. That indicates an aversion to risk.  Over time, however, a sustained rally in altcoins could signal a risk-on environment, similar to what occurred in January and August of last year.  The chart below shows the bitcoin dominance ratio, or BTC's market cap relative to the total crypto market cap. The ratio broke above a short-term downtrend last week and continues to tick higher. A sustained reading above 50% would signal a risk-off environment similar to what occurred in 2018.

Bitcoin Long-Term Holder SOPR Spiked Up When Price Crossed $30k As pointed out by a CryptoQuant post, selling pressure in the market still looks to be high as long-term holders are also looking to sell. The &apos;spent output profit ratio&apos; is an indicator that tells us whether the overall market is selling Bitcoin at a profit or loss right now. The metric works by checking the on-chain history of each coin being sold to see what price it last moved at. It then divides the current price (that is, the selling price) with the last price. When the value of this ratio is greater than one, it means investors are, on an average, selling at a profit at the moment. On the other hand, values of the indicator less than one imply that the Bitcoin market as a whole is realizing loss currently. A cohort of BTC investors is the &apos;long-term holder&apos; (LTH) group, who hold their coins for at least 155 days before selling.

Though describing the bill as a “good law,” Cortizo – speaking at a Bloomberg event – said that with the current information he has, he’s inclined not to give his signature.  “I have to be very careful if the law has clauses related to money laundering activities or anti-money laundering activities,” Cortizo said. “That is very important for us.”  He noted that his country has been trying to get removed from the Financial Action Task Force's (FATF) ""grey list,"" which means the global anti-money laundering group monitors a country more closely after it identifies a deficiency in that country's money laundering and counter-terrorism financing controls.  In March, the FATF urged Panama to produce an “action plan” to address its concerns by June.  The crypto bill – presented by the Panamanian Congressman Gabriel Silva and approved during a plenary session of the Legislative Assembly by a 40-0 vote on April 28 – requires the signature of Cortizo to become law. His decision is due no later than 30 days after passage.  Although the legislation doesn't allow for any cryptocurrency to become legal tender, it makes possible the free use of crypto as a means of payment for any transaction.

42411448,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glO4J8,1652983683,"Ryder Ripps, Bored Apes and 'Owning' an NFT","Ryder Ripps, a contemporary artist known for his satire, stunts and design work for millennial-geared brands, has begun minting a non-fungible token (NFT) set mocking the highly influential Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC).  About 550 tokens were minted “by hand” by Ripps since Monday, he said. Each features a unique siminan character already seen in the Bored Apes fictional world. That’s to say, Ripps is aping the apes.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Foundation, an NFT marketplace, had suspended trading of several of the images earlier this week after receiving a Digital Millennium Copyright Act request. According to a letter shared by Ripps, his work had violated corporate stewart of the Bored Apes brand, Yuga Labs', intellectual property. Though Ripps had intended to fight the DMCA – as he's done before to defend other artistic acts of plagiarism – the images are again live and stirring controversy in the NFT industry.  “i havent (sic) slept,” Ripps said in a private message yesterday at around 11:00 UTC.  “minting  “by hand  “hehe.”  Buyers of the so-called “RR/BAYC” tokens, an abbreviation of Ripps’ name, see this act as a work of “performance art.” Ripps is taking Yuga Labs’ copyrightable material and putting it in a new context by appending a different non-fungible blockchain signature to it. The images may be the same, though the meaning is different, he said.  NFTs are a type of blockchain-based technology used to append a tradable asset to another piece of digital data, such as a PDF, GIF or MP3. Supporters believe they have use for improving the provenance of data and granting infinitely reproducible files a type of unique identity.  NFTs are also increasingly a tool used for fundraising – sometimes in ways that look to fall afoul of established securities laws. Seen as a hotbed for innovation and artistic production, the sector is also raising issues around copyright law and what it means to own a digital file.  The Bored Ape Yacht Club allows its token holders to monetize their NFTs and the associated characters, in an effort that could be called decentralized brand building. Ape holders have opened theme restaurants, sold Ape merchandise and have expanded the club’s lore through fan art.  See also: Neil Strauss Pens the Bored Ape Yacht Club 'Tell-All'  It's unclear why or how Ripps' images were first taken down, a process that could have been automated, or put back up on Foundation, which Ripps thinks must have come as a direct act from Yuga Labs.  ""It sends a huge message, like, if they went out of their way to cancel that request,"" Ripps said in a phone call. A representative for Yuga Labs did not respond to multiple requests for comment.  Ripps has mostly been selling his fake apes for .1 ETH, worth about $200 currently. A Twitter user of the name @VardCrypto was gifted a RR/BAYC token after telling Ripps he enjoyed the prank and asking for a discount.  “Conceptual art isn't something you see within the NFT space everyday,” Vard told CoinDesk. “I love the fact [Ripps is] using the exact BAYC base URI [uniform resource identifier, used to address online data] to prove you cannot copy an NFT.”  This is not the first time Ripps has made an artistic statement about NFTs or criticized successful “profile pic” projects. Also called PFPs, these projects refer to an NFT sector of mostly cartoonish animal figures like Lazy Lions, Pudgy Penguins and MiLadies that buyers use as online avatars.  In July of last year, Ripps “punked the CryptoPunks,” an early NFT art series of highly valuable collector’s items, by copy/pasting a punk file, minting his own token and using it as his profile picture on social media platforms including Twitter. Ripps’s version of Punk 3100 was identical to the CryptoPunk NFT first minted by Larva Labs in 2017, except for the token attached to it.  “By engaging their so-called art with the Ethereum network, they should be believers in the self-governing ideals of cryptocurrency. I question Larva Labs's motives, understanding of art, understanding of ‘punk’ and understanding of cryptocurrency/NFT,” Ripps told CoinDesk at the time.  Over the past year, Ripps has also sought to draw attention to supposed racist tropes present in the Bored Ape Yacht Club. He hosts a website called Gordon Goner, referring to one of the once-pseudonymous founders of Yuga Labs, detailing what he calls “dog whistles” and “Nazi imagery” in the series.  ""If you've been on 4chan this is just classic trolling,"" Ripps said, referring to some of the obscure references or ""inside jokes"" he said he found. ""It's surprising how far they took it.""  Yuga Labs has denied Ripps' accusations, and other outside observers have called some of his claims superficial, spurious or coincidental.  “I bought [a RR/BAYC] because I’ve been following his work for years, and although he’s known for design his satire is my favorite and his most poignant. I would never consider a Yuga Labs purchase of any kind,” an NFT collector who goes by krystall.eth told CoinDesk.  Though others are participating in a boycott, the bored brand is only growing. Celebrities including Justin Beiber, Jimmy Fallon and Snoop Dogg have all joined the “yacht club.” A recent sale of virtual land tied to the BAYC “metaverse” topped $285 million and contributed to a rise in Ethereum transaction fees (which rise based on demand) with the network seeing its fourth-highest trading week coinciding with the sale. Yuga Labs recently closed a $450 million funding round led by premier venture firm Andreessen Horowitz.  There's a film series planned, an APE token and blockchain ""business development teams"" are courting Yuga away from Ethereum.  Ripps’s current BAYC project was kick-started after an argument with prominent NFT influencer j1mmy.eth. Ripps minted a version of j1mmy’s Bored Ape profile picture to push back against claims that holding a token gives someone a unique claim over an image.  “if an Ape comes at you for rocking their PFP they might say ‘well it doesn’t matter, it's not the same NFT!’ to which you should say ‘exactly, you can’t copy an NFT,, therefore it's an original work, with new context/meaning,’ just like the phunks,” Ripps said.  While Ripps’ early experiment with counterfeit CryptoPunks was allowed to continue trading on OpenSea after a failed copyright claim from Larva Labs, some legal experts think the merry prankster may be running into legal trouble this time around.  “The BAYC images are another story. There's no real question that they are copyrightable and that RR's use of them is prima facie infringing,” Brian Frye, a lawyer and conceptual artist known for his own statements on plagiarism, told CoinDesk.  “The problem is that he's selling NFTs associated with the images into the ‘same’ market as [Yuga Labs],” he said.  See also: NFT Artist Brian Frye Wants You to Steal This Article  Ripps said what he is doing would fall under “fair use” of images, a legal copyright exemption meant for education purposes – like a news organization using a Bored Ape image in a story to show what they look like, Frye said.  “But using a BAYC image to illustrate an NFT available for sale is the same thing the copyright owner is doing in order to monetize the work, so courts are unlikely to see it as a fair use,” he said.  Ripps has argued that creating and selling NFTs is an act of art in itself, and that a broader understanding of fair use would apply considering his body of work. Frye also doubted that Yuga would press charges because it might draw attention to Ripps’s race-related criticisms or “make them look like tools.”  On Twitter, Ripps’s project has seen mixed results. A partner with Egirl Capital, @DegenSpartan, asked “what's going on at [the] foundation?” and called it a “free for all,” commenting on the recent brouhaha.  Although Ripps has a First Amendment constitutional right to criticize and comment on an influential project, his work could be said to be diminishing the Bored Ape’s brand and potentially creating confusion in the NFT markets, though that may not matter so much in the eyes of the law.  “Copyright doesn’t care about consumers. In fact, the whole point of copyright is to make consumers pay more in order to benefit copyright owners,” Frye said.  UPDATE (MAY 19, 2022 – 20:45 UTC): Reflects updated number of Apes minted.

42411460,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glO4mt,1652979115,Matt Prewitt: Let’s Use New Forms of Money to Commit to Our Communities,"At age 10, a teacher asked me to write an essay on what I would do to fix a world problem. I declared that I would like to ban money because I saw it at the root of much evil. That idea was clumsy, and what I’ll outline here might be, too, so I present it in a spirit of total humility. Much important work remains to be done to improve this extremely subtle, significant and social institution.  The problem is real. Everyone from Keynesians to bitcoiners agrees that the ways we measure, store and exchange value are flawed at best and broken at worst. I don’t think we’re any closer to an ideal form of money than we are to an ideal language or government. That’s why it’s so exciting to live in an era of programmable money, where we can strip the institution to the studs and rebuild it, in ways that would have only recently been hard to imagine. I’m somewhat disappointed with the monetary innovation that has happened in blockchain technology’s first decade. But many possibilities are only just coming into focus.  Matt Prewitt, the president of the RadicalxChange Foundation, will appear on the ""Big Ideas""stage at CoinDesk's Consensus festival, which runs June 9-12 in Austin, Texas. Learn more.  In this essay, I’ll present a view of money as a communication technology. Then I’ll sketch some paths toward building a new and better kind of money, unlike either fiat or Bitcoin – money for a more prosperous and complex world.  Money is language  Money is a communication technology. It resembles language, democracy, law and telephone networks in that people use it to send messages.  Milton Friedman famously made this point using the example of a pencil. Nobody, he observed, really knows how to make a pencil. To even begin, you’d have to cut down a tree for wood. For that, you’d need a saw made of decent steel. For that, you’d need to start with iron ore. And what about the paint on the pencil, the rubber eraser, the finely processed graphite, the glue, the metal piece that attaches the eraser to the wood? Et cetera. Summoning this humble miracle is not some individual polymathic craftsperson, but simply the price mechanism, through which people around the world cooperate despite never meeting (and, Friedman significantly observes, possibly even hating each other).  Austrian School economists Friedrich Hayek and Ludwig von Mises similarly saw the economy as an information system, using price to integrate vast data about what people subjectively need where, when and how badly. I have important disagreements with these thinkers, but I share their view of the economy as an information processing system based on the price mechanism. Money is the language we speak and understand when we interact with one another through the economy.  Languages are imperfect  As with every other complex information processor, the economy’s informational outputs must be somehow compressed or diminished compared to what went in. This is connected to the principle that entropy, or disorder, tends to increase over time – the basic idea in modern information theory, and the ironclad second law of thermodynamics.  Currencies circulating locally rather than globally could bend market participants’ plane of focus like a lens.  It sounds awfully abstract to say that disorder increases in information systems, but the idea is simple. A photograph of a sunset always misses something. Words never perfectly convey their message. A map carries less information than the territory it depicts. This is the entire point of processing information: photographs, words and maps usefully summarize things that we couldn’t otherwise communicate. But we have to be very careful to understand the limitations of our summaries, and to realize that true progress flows from facing and mitigating those limitations. This is why photographers seek better cameras, languages evolve, and a map-maker’s work is never finished.  Money, too, carries information, and it is not exempt from this universal law. The question is not whether it muddles its messages, but how.  The information money carries  Cameras receive information through an aperture and form an image. Markets receive information through peoples’ decisions to buy, sell or hold things, and form a price. But what goes into the decisions that form prices? Do prices convey less information than they might, or superfluous information that they needn’t? If so, we might think of that like signal distortion or noise. And, just as a lens helps a camera capture a clearer image, a different kind of money might contribute to a better economy by capturing better information.  Whenever we take actions in markets – buy, sell or hold – we are always comparing alternatives. For example, would I rather have (a) $5,000 or (b) a beautiful antique table? The choice is actually much more complicated than it sounds because to choose wisely I have to think about people other than myself. For example, I might sorely need $5,000, and dislike the table.  But if I think that someone out there in the marketplace would be willing to pay $7,500 for the table, then my expressed preference will change. Eyeing a $2,500 profit, I’ll communicate to the market that I prefer the table to $5,000, even though this is flatly untrue. I just prefer $7,500 to $5,000.  If we want prices to tell us what the global highest bidder will pay, then this process looks efficient. But from another perspective, it looks noisy and wasteful. After all, everyone participating in a market knows more about themselves than they know about others. So you’d think we’d want markets to gather that special information that every actor is in a uniquely good position to give: How much do you want the table? But, instead, the global market asks us also to speculate about what the world’s richest table enthusiast would pay, and incorporate that into our decisions to buy, sell or hold.  Stated differently, the global market asks us to think and communicate about things we aren’t in any special position to know about. This is a significant cognitive burden, multiplied across countless decisions in the economy. And it drowns out other information from the price signal. Even though everyone participates in markets, markets aren’t finding out what everyone thinks about the value of things. They’re only finding out what the highest bidders think.  A reason Austrians like gold  My argument partly tracks the case some Austrian School economists make for gold (and now bitcoin). These hard-to-mint kinds of money ease people’s cognitive burdens, according to the Austrians, by making it simple to save. By contrast, the threat of inflation with easy-to-mint money forces everyone to invest rather than save: We all have to “play the markets,” guessing about what the global highest bidders are going to pay next year for tech stocks, euros and beachfront real estate, instead of just socking money away and planning for our own futures. This amounts to a division-of-labor problem. It means people who are great at, say, music must spend less time making brilliant music and more time amateurishly investing money, just in order to not lose what they’ve earned.  But (and here’s where I leave Salzburg): Markets asking everyone to think seriously about what other people are going to want next year isn’t necessarily such a bad thing. Arguably, it’s a feature rather than a bug – inducing distributed intelligence into the problem of capital allocation across society might be worth the mental bandwidth it demands.  Yet the Austrians are pointing to a genuine problem, because it is wasteful for people to have to assess complex things they have no special knowledge about. Unhappily, the fiat-dominated global market asks us to do this all the time. But moving to a world in which everyone simply hoards hard money would swing the pendulum back to an opposite extreme of individualism, inattention to the capital needs of others and compounding power concentration.  The real problem arises from a difference in scale between an individual person and the global (or other very large) market environment in which they must set their prices. The chasm of scale between the limited concerns of individuals and the vastness of the market, makes the information they provide to markets noisy – like a microphone signal with too much gain or a photograph taken with too long an exposure.  The situation could be completely different, though, if markets incentivized us to price things in local rather than global terms. Then, when making our decisions to buy, sell or hold, we’d consider only what we need and what our communities need – not what the entire global market needs. This would not waste so much energy because our communities are close to us. We actually have special knowledge about them.  The promise of alternative currencies  This helps explain the attraction of local currencies (despite their challenges, which I’ll address soon). Currencies circulating locally rather than globally could bend market participants’ plane of focus like a lens, gathering less noisy information. Instead of trying to guess what an expert dealer in Manhattan might pay for an antique table, a participant in a truly local economy would only consider the value of the table to them, and those they know.  Shifting peoples’ attention in this way could unlock healthier and more self-sustaining economic communities. Global trade networks aren’t going anywhere, but meaningful local or community currencies could conceivably form new layers, contributing to a more richly textured global economy, following the principle of subsidiarity (the idea that decisions are best made nearest the people they impact).  Existing and emerging technologies will let us experiment more rapidly than ever before with currency governance.  Capturing locally-meaningful information in prices would facilitate more local transactions, as opposed to global ones. For example, talented professionals in Ohio or Nepal might work for more local businesses, helping to bootstrap local economies instead of holding out only for remote work from the same few global agencies.  Note too that “local currency” need not refer only to geography. We could imagine many intersecting currency networks, operating within communities defined in many different ways.  It’s hard to estimate how much wealth this could generate, but clearly systematically improving the informational quality of prices like this could be a very big deal. So why hasn’t it already happened? Many projects have done meaningful good, but none have truly revolutionized the economy in the way I’m suggesting. Why hasn’t the ease of creating ERC-20 tokens created a boom in community currencies?  Global currency and the trouble with 'exit'  Local currencies have always faced a serious headwind. Because when people accumulate a significant amount in them, they tend to want to exchange it for a more universal form of money. Even before they do that, they perform a mental translation: “How many dollars do I have right now in currency XYZ?”  This is natural because we can spend dollars anywhere, not just where we earned them. Taking what we earned in one community and bringing it to a second where it buys more lets us feel richer as individuals. And yes, there are gains from trade.  But from the point of view of the first community – where the accumulation occurred – this is air leaving the balloon. Local currencies will only truly sustain local economies if they manage to discourage people from exiting with capital.  In other words, for local currencies to capture more information than the global economy, we need people to think in terms of them, instead of always mentally translating to dollars or bitcoins. This might seem like an added cognitive burden – but remember, pricing everything in a local economy would be simpler because you wouldn’t have to consider the willingness-to-pay of strangers on the other side of the world.  The question is, how to do it? How could we actually build community-oriented currencies that people think in, instead of exiting from?  Values, incentives and exit costs – why use local currencies?  An important motivator of community currency use is expressing shared values. Accepting a community’s currency would be a signal of support. Spending it would be a signal of belonging. And the unique values of the community would show up in the resultant economy.  But to preserve this special, local information – this expression of particular, shared values against the winds of global economic incentives – there needs to be a cost (either a direct cost or a clear opportunity cost) to extracting capital from the system. And to be sustainable, that cost would need to be something other than a speculative belief that prices will rise. (Sorry: HODLers aren’t a real community.)  Existing and emerging technologies will let us experiment more rapidly than ever before with currency governance. The key will be to make local and community currency systems semipermeable. We want them to hold energy in, like efficient internal combustion engines – while also breathing and interacting intelligently with the outside economy, like cell membranes with transport proteins. Here are two incentive structures pointing in that direction.  First, the currency might be the only tender in which it is possible to interact with the community’s shared assets. This would create a unique reason to hold it. These assets could include:  Digital partial common ownership tokens. Imagine that a community accumulated a pool of real-world shared assets, such as real estate, industrial equipment or compute power. To get the right to use those assets (which you could use to profit secondarily in other currencies, like USD), you’d need to use the community currency to “rent” it from the community (or better, buy the SALSA rights).  Community quadratic funding (a mathematically optimal way to distribute money in the public interest). Communities with their own currencies could operate quadratic funding processes requiring the community currency for participation. Thus you could use it to influence the allocation of shared community funds for public goods of your choosing.  Exit taxes. In an earlier piece, I sketched some ideas for an exit tax structure where you’d have to pay a higher fee to the community when transferring capital to more socially-distant communities, and/or from richer addresses. The identity structures based on “soulbound” tokens, described by E. Glen Weyl, Puja Ohlhaver and Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin in their recent paper, constitute a design space for enriching these taxes. More work is still needed on this, but generally we’d want to design exit taxes that are high enough that most people don’t think very much about removing their money from the community, yet are low enough that obviously beneficial external transactions can still occur. And these should only apply to unilateral decisions about removing capital: The community, through delegated or democratic decision-making, should have a free hand with external economic relationships.  Conclusion  Money isn’t perfect. It has changed throughout history; it’s a technology that can be improved. In the modern era, it is failing us because it’s too universal. It draws our attention away from the communities that are the real sources of our wealth. The biggest opportunity new technologies afford is not to help us “exit” our communities, but to help us to commit to them. This could make the world not only wealthier, but more pluralistic.

Ethereum 2.0 Goes To Testnet Testing for Ethereum&apos;s long-awaited Merge is progressing, though not at the rate that many had hoped. Testing on Ropsten, Ethereum&apos;s largest and primary testnet, which has the closest similarity to the mainnet, is the next key milestone in the Merge testing process. Ropsten testing will be merged on June 8, according to Ethereum client developers. Although there is no official indication on when the Merge will take place on mainnet, it is expected to happen in the second part of this year. On Monday, Ethereum DevOps developer Parathi Jayanathi submitted a pull request for the Ropsten testnet Merge configuration code, indicating that it is ready for implementation. The Merge is Ethereum&apos;s long-awaited upgrade, in which the current Ethereum Mainnet and the beacon chain PoS system will merge.

Alessio Evangelista, the associate director for Enforcement at the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), said that “too often” crypto service providers have opted to keep their heads in the sand about blatantly suspect wallets “right up until the day of an OFAC designation or criminal indictment.”  Speaking before an audience of compliance wonks at the Chainalysis LINKS conference, Evangelista warned that virtual asset service providers are “putting their own reputation at risk” by ignoring “clearly observable red flags that they could and arguably should have taken note of long ago.”  The comments highlight federal officials’ growing concerns over crypto crime, a multibillion-dollar backwater that in some cases now threatens national security. This month, Treasury officers for the first time sanctioned a crypto mixer – an on-chain privacy tool that crypto holders use to hide their tracks – over processing assets stolen by North Korean hackers in the $620 million Axie Infinity heist.  “These funds were stolen to support a totalitarian regime that spends its money on developing weapons of mass destruction at the expense of feeding its citizens,” Evangelista said. He said virtual asset service providers have an obligation to effectively police themselves.  He also called out crypto projects for which “decentralization” was more buzzword than reality. Crypto entities that operate under the direction of individuals cannot skirt around their compliance obligations by falsely calling themselves decentralized, he said.  North Korean hackers have used multiple crypto mixers to launder funds stolen from Axie, including Blender, the first mixer to be sanctioned, and Tornado Cash.

That is quite unfortunate since several of them may serve as crucial indicators for various aspects of the respective coin. It is only fair that these terms are explained in depth. UTXO is one such term. Read to understand more about that terminology as used in crypto. A Brief on UTXO UTXO is an abbreviation of Unspent Transaction Output. It is a more technical wording for the amount of crypto left behind after a transaction is executed. One can link it to the pocket change they get after purchasing a good using a higher note value. However, a key difference is that, unlike change, UTXO is not in a lower denomination value. What it represents is a blockchain network-generated, database-based transaction output. It plays the primary role of enabling non-exact transactions, transactions that aren&apos;t in whole numbers of a crypto coin. In simpler words, all UTXO amounts are recorded in a database as reusable inputs for new transactions. Explanation Using a Sample Transaction The assumption used for this sample transaction is that the price of 1BTC is $40,000. If a transaction involving goods worth $30,000 is executed and the buyer prefers to pay via BTC, only 0.75BTC will be required.

While his time on the board of advisers at Ripple wasn’t raised during his opening testimony at a Senate Banking Committee hearing on his confirmation, Barr – now dean of the public policy arm of the University of Michigan Law School – was asked about his thoughts on current troubles in the crypto industry.  “In issues such as stablecoins there could be financial stability risks, and I think it’s quite important that Congress and regulatory agencies wrap their arms around those financial stability risks and regulate,” he said.  As for crypto that people treat as investments, the main concern is investor protection, he said, “and that really is the responsibility of other agencies.”  If confirmed by the Senate, the former senior official in the U.S. Department of the Treasury will be the Fed’s next vice chairman for supervision and will occupy a key role in what happens next with stablecoins. He’ll also have input on the Fed’s decision about whether to launch a digital dollar, which he said should have sign-off from Congress and the Biden administration before the Fed makes a decision.  The Thursday hearing also weighed the confirmations of Jaime Lizárraga and Mark Uyeda to join the Securities and Exchange Commission, where Chairman Gary Gensler has been occupying a major role in the government’s response to the rapid growth of the crypto industry.  Uyeda, an SEC lawyer who has been detailed to work with the committee's Republican staff, fielded a question on the agency's recent accounting guidance that spurred Coinbase (COIN) to warn customers that their digital assets could be locked up were the company to file for bankruptcy protection. The nominee argued that the SEC's bulletin was only a staff position that didn't get commission approval. He raised the point that adding any new policy at the SEC ""that is effectively a rule"" needs to go through the proper notice-and-comment process as well as a formal vote.  ""There has been a tremendous amount of concern raised,"" he said. ""If confirmed, it is something that I will want to look much more into and have a discussion with the staff.""  That custody question has influenced the Biden administration to press Congress to require crypto exchanges segregate their customers' funds from their own, CoinDesk reported earlier.  Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) raised questions about cryptocurrencies and investor protections to all three nominees, pointing to last week’s TerraUSD meltdown: ""Turns out, [UST] was not so stable. If you put $1,000 in Terra 10 days ago, you'd get back $90.""  ""Online investor forums have been flooded with harrowing posts” from investors who lost their life savings, she said, adding that it “smells a lot like 2008.""

42421158,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXasDl,1652976615,Frances Haugen: Facebook Informer,"You don’t like Facebook. Democrats don’t like Facebook. Republicans don’t like Facebook. It may be the one thing on which most of the United States agrees.  But the “Facebook Problem” is almost certainly worse than you think.  That’s the core message of Frances Haugen, the former Facebook projects manager who, in September 2021, disclosed over 20,000 pages of documents that shed light on the darkest of online places. The evidence fueled the reporting of The Wall Street Journal’s “The Facebook Files,” which found the company, whose corporate name is now Meta (FB), “knows, in acute detail, that its platforms are riddled with flaws that cause harm, often in ways only the company fully understands.”  This article is part of Road to Consensus, a series highlighting speakers and the big ideas they will discuss at Consensus 2022, CoinDesk's festival of the year June 9-12 in Austin, Texas. Learn more.  Just some of the damning takeaways: Facebook’s algorithms knowingly made the site “angrier” to boost engagement, Facebook was intentionally trying to recruit preteens (even though the minimum age is 13) and that Facebook knew that Instagram is toxic for teenage girls.  Haugen then testified before the U.S. Congress, where she charged that “Facebook’s products harm children, stoke division and weaken our democracy.” Based in Puerto Rico, she now describes herself as an “advocate for accountability and transparency in social media,” recently writing an essay for The New York Times praising Europe’s Digital Services Act, which she thinks will “for the first time pull back the curtain on the algorithms that choose what we see and when we see it in our feeds.” She’s happy about the Digital Services Act, but knows it’s only a start.  One possible solution?  Blockchain.  On a recent Zoom call, Haugen suggested an arresting thought experiment: What if Facebook had been founded as a decentralized autonomous organization? “If there had been a DAO that was regulating Facebook – if it had been owned by the users – I don't think we would've said, ""Hey, keep putting random [stuff] in our accounts that we didn’t ask for,” says Haugen.  She suspects that a “distributed” type of social network – one that’s truly knitted from our friends and family – could offer a better path forward. Haugen also explains why the problem is more global than you think, what she wants to see as a solution (hint: it’s not great news for CEO Mark Zuckerberg) and why Elon Musk buying Twitter (TWTR) might be a win for social media.  So it’s been over seven months since the ""Facebook Files."" What strikes you as the biggest problem today?  I would say it's around algorithm ranking. So in March of 2021, Nick Clegg [ex-deputy prime minister of the U.K. and vice‑president of global affairs at Meta] – oh, bless his heart – came out with an article called ""It Takes Two To Tango."" I strongly encourage you to go read that editorial. It’s a work of art.  He says [and I’m paraphrasing], “Hey, you keep blaming us for the stuff you see on Facebook, but let's be honest here. You chose your friends, you chose your interests. It takes two to tango. Watch where you're pointing that finger, because four fingers are pointing back at you.""  I’m guessing you don’t find this particularly compelling!  Talk about victim blaming. He said this while knowing that Facebook's researchers had run the same experiment over and over again, where they took blank accounts and they followed moderate interests. In the case of Instagram, they followed healthy eating accounts. And let’s be honest, we could all eat a little healthier.  Or a lot healthier, in my case.  And all [people] did was click on the first five or 10 things each day, and follow any hashtags that were suggested. Within two to three weeks, they were being sent actively pro-anorexia content, and active self-harm content. There was no “two people tangoing.” It was just the escalator of engagement-based ranking.  Can you elaborate on why this is so important?  I'll give you a little example. So I was interviewed by a journalist maybe two weeks ago, and he just had a baby and he made a new account for his baby. It's a very cute baby. The only things they post in this account are cute baby photos. There's one photo a day. The baby has no friends other than other cute babies, right?  It sounds like a pretty great account, to be honest.  They only post cute baby photos. And yet, 10% of his feed is of children suffering. It's of children in the hospital, the tubes coming out of them. It's of severely deformed children. Dying children. What in the world takes you from cute baby to mangled child?  Read more: David Z. Morris - Facebook Steals Another Crypto Idea for Its Nonsensical Rebrand  Because all the algorithm knows is there's a thing called babies, and that some baby content ends up getting higher engagement than other content. It turns out that even though he has not put a comment on a single one of those photos, and he has not put a Like on any one of those photos, he probably dwells on them.  That’s unsettling as hell.  Think about what that does in other contexts, right? In the case of teenagers, it leads to kids starving themselves or killing themselves. In the case of adults, it pulls people towards these extremes. When they ran the experiment with a center-left kind of [viewpoint], they got pushed towards let’s-kill-Republicans. When they did it on center-right, they got pushed towards white genocide. And this is not on a month’s time horizon. This is on a week’s time horizon.  It’s terrifying.  Think about what that does in society. And this is where it gets really scary. This is why I get up every single day. The version of Facebook we interact with in the United States is the cleanest, most sanitized version of Facebook in the world.  In 2020, they spent 87% of their misinformation budget on English, even if only 9% of users spoke English. Most people are unaware that there are at least a billion people in the world – if not 2 billion people – for whom the internet equals Facebook.  2 billion?  Facebook went into their countries and because of something called Free Basics they said, “Hey if you use Facebook, your data is free. If you use anything on the open web, you will pay for the data yourself.""  So think of what that market dynamic does in terms of pushing everyone onto Facebook. Now you have a situation where it's a very fragile country. The most fragile places in the world are often linguistically diverse, they speak smaller languages and now Facebook's business model can't support giving you safety systems.  When we focus on censorship, instead of focusing on product safety we basically leave behind people who are in the most fragile places on Earth. And those people don't get to leave Facebook. They don’t get to consent.  What do you see as blockchain’s role in all of this, as a possible solution?  The thing that makes me most excited is, [what if] there had been a DAO governing Facebook in 2008? To be clear, the problem with Facebook is not your family or your friends.  Facebook has run experiments where all [it does] is give you more content that you consented to. That’s content from people you actually friended, pages you actually followed, groups you actually joined. When [it does] that for free, you've got less hate speech, less nudity, less violence. They're just like, ""Hey, let's trust your judgment, and give you more of what you ask for.” Not rocket science.  [But] Facebook had to get you to consume more content every single quarter since 2008, and family and friends let Facebook down. Facebook needed them to keep producing more and more content. And when they didn't, they started doing all these weird little hacks.  So how would a DAO fit into this?  If there had been a DAO that was regulating Facebook – if it had been owned by the users – I don't think we would've said, ""Hey, keep putting random [crap] in our accounts that we didn’t ask for.” We'd still have something that was like Facebook of 2008. So I’m cautiously optimistic that exploring different business models could have potential.  The secondary thing is, I think it would be easier to run a version of Facebook that was about our family and friends. Family and friends are not the problem. A system of amplification that’s using algorithms to direct our attention – that's the problem.  Podcast: What Facebook’s Patents Tell Us About the Fight for the Soul of the Metaverse  You know, if you can do it in a distributed way, and [build] a system that's very much like Facebook, but it's just your family and friends, I think that would be much safer.  What do you think it will take to ultimately solve the Facebook problem?  I think, at a minimum, it’s a corporate governance issue. One of the fundamental problems with Facebook is that [it] won't acknowledge power. [It] can’t acknowledge responsibility. For example, let's look at the situation where high school kids are getting broken bones because kids are picking fights to put them on Instagram. Think about that for a moment. What would it take for Instagram to take that account down? Why aren’t they taking that down?  They can't acknowledge responsibility. So unless there’s a major leadership change … I spoke at a risk conference yesterday, and the CEO of the trade organization was saying, “It's not about having checklists. It’s not about making sure someone goes through a form. It’s about having a culture of accountability.” And fundamentally, Facebook lacks a culture of accountability.  What are you hoping to see?  My hope is that the [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission] acts. And one of the things we're going to ask is for them to require Mark [Zuckerberg] to sell some of his stock. That would allow the shareholders to step in. So that's my big hope. Who knows if it will happen or not?  And I think the fact that the DSA [Digital Services Act] passed means that we're going to be able to start developing solutions.  Give us an example?  I'll give you one that works in every language. Should you have to click on a link to re-share it?  That makes so much sense.  Twitter requires you to do it, Facebook doesn't require you to do it. And it reduces misinformation by 10% to 15%.  Speaking of Twitter, you once suggested that a private Twitter – owned by [Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon] Musk – might actually be safer. Why is that?  So remember how I was talking about how before, if there had been a DAO for Facebook, we probably wouldn't have gotten a bunch of [crap] injected into our accounts? It would have stayed much more about our family and friends. There are a lot of non-content based solutions.  What do you mean by that?  That means focusing on product safety, not magical AIs [artificial intelligence] that pull things out [as a form of censorship]. But the only way you can do those things is if you're willing to sacrifice little slivers of profit and little numbers of users. So part of why I’m willing to root for Elon is that the first thing he said publicly is that we’re taking down the bots.  A thing that most people aren’t aware of – and this might be interesting for this specific [crypto] audience – is that when we talk about dollars, we have very detailed accounting laws, right? So, if you want to say I have a dollar or I have a liability, [there are] very specific rules on when you have to acknowledge these things.  We don't have a similar set of rules for what is a person, but the values of companies are incredibly dependent on the number of users they say they have. And I've talked to people who run the biggest captchas in the world, and they say there are websites where 90% of the reported users are bots.  Damn.  Right. And those sites intentionally choose very lax captcha settings because they want to have bigger numbers, but the number-one threat to us is bots. And Elon was, like, “We’re going to take advantage of the fact that we don’t have to report user numbers anymore to wipe the slate clean.”  Let’s finish on a personal note. What you did was incredibly brave. If you don’t mind sharing, what has the aftermath been like for you?  You know, it's interesting. People imagine the gnashing of teeth, the drama, all of these things. But I’ve had a remarkably uneventful transition.  I’m surprised and delighted to hear that.  I guess I get interviewed a lot more. But in Puerto Rico no one recognizes me, which is great. Even online it's crazy. I think I’ve gotten maybe 15 to 20 mean things ever sent to me in my DMs. So if you'd like to be the first … [Both laugh.]  And the part I find remarkable is that [often] women who are public figures get really badly sexually harassed. I don’t even get sexually harassed, which is shocking to me as someone who has worked on four social networks. So I can't really complain. It's been pretty chill.  Fingers crossed it stays that way.

Whales have so much power and influence on the crypto market. As such, they can cause shifts in the crypto prices, causing panic selling. However, employing accurate strategies to assist in overcoming the need to panic sell cryptocurrencies is essential. Nonetheless, a sign of a well-seasoned investor is not making haste decisions at any sign of market instability. To be accurate, most investors are risk-averse and always want to avoid losses. Regardless, for a good investment, a long-term mindset and logical approach are keys to outsmarting short-term down markets. Crypto Whales Crypto Whales refer to individuals or groups of people to come together to hold a large share of a specific coin in the crypto market. Whales normally include Bitcoin Investment Funds and Hedge Funds. Among them are Falcon Global Capital, Bitcoin Reserve, Pantera Capital, KPMG, Bitcoin Investment Trust, and Fortress, among others. The Whales can cause market shifts in prices. An example was an instance in 2014 where someone posted a sell order of 30,000 BTC at $300 each, which was below the mid-300s bitcoin price levels.

According to weekly data from DappRadar, Magic Eden has seen roughly 275,000 daily transactions (which includes purchases, bids and listings) compared with OpenSea’s 50,000, according to weekly data from DappRadar.  When reached by CoinDesk, Magic Eden provided data showing 330,000 true sales (not also bids and listings like the DappRadar data) had occurred over the last week, which works out to about 47,000 daily transactions.  The number of unique users trading NFTs on each platform, however, remains in favor of OpenSea. In the past 24 hours, Magic Eden has hosted 24,000 traders, with OpenSea hosting 41,000, according to DappRadar.  While Magic Eden users are transacting at greater rates than on OpenSea, the lack of blue-chip NFT projects on the Solana system has led to lower total sales volume, despite more transactions.  In terms of capital being spent, OpenSea remains a good distance ahead, seeing $35 million of sales volume compared to Magic Eden’s $10 million. The average price of an NFT traded on OpenSea was also over $700, well above Magic Eden’s average price of $123.  Magic Eden emerges  The difference in the ways NFT traders are interacting with the two platforms is likely, in part, a result of network fees on the different blockchains. At the time of writing, the gas fees to buy a single Ethereum-based NFT on OpenSea are around $30, with Solana fees being less than a cent.  Usage stats over a 30-day period tell a similar story, though OpenSea’s total volume of traders is down 1% from the previous month while Magic Eden’s has increased 316%.  On-chain data of this nature can also be misleading, with metrics like transactions and sales volume being subject to varying definitions and even manipulation.  All in all, the NFT market is seeing a shift away from its formerly Ethereum-dominated ways, with traders more evenly spread between alt-chain marketplaces and the average number of user transactions increasing with fewer fees.  OpenSea does, of course, offer Solana NFT trading of its own, having announced the integration in early April. But usage on the platform has so far lagged behind the hype, with Solana NFT sales on OpenSea being around 9% of Magic Eden’s since launch, according to data from Magic Eden.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,Eli Tan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/05/19/magic-eden-tops-opensea-in-daily-trading-volume-as-solana-nfts-heat-up,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e3cfeda3f54ca20aa074c9122e29467b74fc3e9e-4253x3190.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Juvvadi was also Uber's chief regulatory counsel and its first regulatory attorney, helping the company's efforts to secure favorable laws and registrations at local, state and federal levels in the U.S.  The hire echoes the efforts in Binance.US' parent firm to bolster its legal and compliance team, with Bloomberg reporting this week that the crypto exchange is looking to hire 30 lawyers, predominantly in data privacy and regulatory counsel roles.  Binance has been attempting to forge better relations with regulators in recent months following a string of warnings issued against it from regulatory bodies and other entities last year.  ""I have been impressed by the significant, purposeful steps the company has taken in recent months to bolster its legal and compliance efforts,” Juvvadi said.  Juvvadi follows the path of Binance.US CEO Brian Shroder, who spent two years as head of strategy and business development for Uber in Asia Pacific from 2016 to 2018.

42374678,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw1uSJ,1652972298,NYDFS Chief Says Regulators Need to Develop a ‘21st Century Framework’ for Crypto,"New York’s top financial regulator believes the current approach to digital asset regulation – both at the state and federal level – is due for an update.  At a Chainalysis conference on Thursday, New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) Superintendent Adrienne Harris said her agency is working to hire additional staff and update its guidance to better deal with the challenges of regulating the ever-changing crypto industry.  “Virtual assets are the first type of assets we’ve seen that are shape shifting,” Harris said. “As we watch federal regulators engage in the space, [crypto] doesn’t necessarily fit neatly into the commodities bucket or the securities bucket or the currency bucket.”  “So how do you tackle a digital asset whose definition changes based on use case? I think that’s going to require regulators to have a more 21st century framework for thinking about these things,” Harris added.  To do business in New York, crypto companies must be regulated by NYDFS, which also oversees banks and other traditional financial institutions. The agency’s regulatory standards are some of the strictest in the country, and many in the industry have criticized the agency for placing burdensome requirements on crypto startups that they say discourages businesses from setting up shop in the Empire State.  Read more: Can You Really Build a ‘Crypto Empire’ in the Empire State?  The process of obtaining NYDFS’ BitLicense, a golden ticket to operate in New York, is very difficult, sometimes taking years – and hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees.  Harris said improving NYDFS’ process management systems is a top priority.  “It's no secret that the licensing and business approvals have taken too long,” Harris said. “So we're doing a lot of work on process management to make sure that everything we do is much more efficient, faster, but without sacrificing the regulatory rigor that we need.”  Harris said the recent decision by the New York State Senate to allow NYDFS to charge crypto companies for “assessments” will boost the agency’s ability to regulate effectively. Unlike many other government agencies, NYDFS is not funded by taxpayer money, instead getting its budget from “supervisory costs” from the institutions it oversees.  “It really is a service to the industry when you can work hand in hand with your regulator and your examiner,” Harris said of the assessments. “We can help identify issues early before they metastasize … it helps us as regulators better oversee the market and protect consumers.”  Mayor Adams’ crypto dreams  New York City Mayor Eric Adams has spoken often about his ambitions of making New York the “hub” of the global crypto industry – something Harris feels passionately about, too.  “I'm a firm believer that [NYDFS] can be good for consumers, good for markets, but also cement New York's place as the financial capital of the world, and [make it a] great place to do business, whether you're in crypto or other areas of financial services,” Harris said.  Though Harris admitted New York’s regulations are stricter than other states, she said it has not stopped companies from setting up shop in the city.  “There’s a lot of talk when you talk to other regulators, I think most particularly in the federal government, about a ‘race to the bottom,’ that states will regulate differently, and those with lower standards are going to attract more companies,” Harris said. “But we haven’t really seen that play out in practice.”  Harris pointed out that New York-based crypto companies received about half of all venture capital investment in the space last year – double what Silicon Valley companies received and eight times higher than venture capital investments in Miami.  “Not that I’m competitive,” Harris joked.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/05/19/nydfs-chief-says-regulators-need-to-develop-a-21st-century-framework-for-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3eb4f5cea4ad938ba7a3aaac7c23eb8914a67987-4032x3024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The majority of this $20.1 billion(around $18 billion) is comprised of A-1 and A-2 paper, which qualify as investment grade, according to the report. A list of ratings agencies grading the commercial paper wasn't specified other than, ""Standard & Poor’s ratings, or equivalent ratings by Moody’s, Fitch or other nationally recognized statistical rating organizations"" in the footnotes. The geographic location of the commercial paper issuers was also not found in the report.  The reduction in commercial paper has continued with a further 20% cut since April 1, which will be reflected in the second-quarter report, Tether announced Thursday. On June 30, 2021, commercial paper and certificates of deposit totaled $30.8 billion, or 49% of Tether's assets at that time.  Tether has also slightly reduced its cash deposits from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion and increased its U.S. Treasury bond holdings from $34.5 billion to $39.2 billion since its last report.  The latest report also revealed that $286 million of its assets were held in foreign government bonds with a maturity of less than 180 days. In Tether's previous report, through the end of last December, there was no mention of holdings of any non U.S. government bonds, according to Barron's.  The ""other investments"" category, which includes digital tokens, has remained consistent, falling slightly from $5.02 billion to $4.96 billion. This area has been thought of as the most troubling aspect of the attestation reports because of uncertainty about what exactly these assets are, which Tether doesn't disclose.  Furthermore, the report does not account for the recent pullback in crypto markets witnessed since early May.  Tether's attestation report is authorized by accounting firm MHA Cayman. As part of a settlement with the New York attorney general in February 2021, Tether must release quarterly attestations of its assets and liabilities in order to be more transparent when it comes to what exactly backs its tether (USDT) stablecoin.  Tether now has a total of $82.4 billion in assets, up from $78.7 billion on Dec. 31.

Another challenge is the volatility of the currency. While this can be seen as a positive by some, others see it as a hindrance to its widespread use. Finally, there is the issue of regulation. As TerraUSD is not backed by any government or financial institution, it is not subject to the same rules and regulations as other currencies. This can be seen as a positive by some, as it allows the currency to operate outside of the traditional financial system. However, it also means that there is no one to turn to if things go wrong.

Previously the brand has led the way in the NFT space through several innovative partnerships and today we&apos;re speaking directly to Charles Stanton, the Chief Marketing Office at Forj to learn more about the launch, what changes we can expect and how Forj is ultimately focusing on simplifying Web3 and forging strong fan and creator partnerships. Interestingly the launch is a result of an extensive rebrand undertaken over the course of the past six months led by leading brand design exports whose clients included Disney and Coca-Cola! Q: Can you please explain what Bondly Finance does? A: Bondly Finance is an end-to-end Web3 and NFT solutions provider, majority-owned by Animoca Brands, working with big brands and creators across a range of projects and campaigns leveraging our technology to meet their requirements. Q: What is the reason behind the rebranding exercise? A: Along with Animoca Brands we are committed to onboarding the next wave of consumers into Web3, and we knew Bondly Finance wasn&apos;t the right brand for that in the long term. It&apos;s far too centred on DeFi and the &apos;finance&apos; angle doesn&apos;t have broader appeal to the majority of creators and fans out there.

42423275,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2YBjh,1652968463,MicroStrategy’s New CFO Says Bitcoin Strategy Unchanged Amid Market Drop: Report,"MicroStrategy (MSTR) Chief Financial Officer Andrew Kang told The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday that the company’s strategy to buy and hold bitcoin (BTC) for the long term won’t change despite the crypto and broader stock market rout.  Kang said the company has no intention to sell right now and hasn’t faced pressure from shareholders, according to the report.  Comments from Kang come after MicroStrategy’s CEO Michael Saylor has consistently reiterated that the company won’t be selling its bitcoin holdings.  MicroStrategy has faced questions recently around its term loan from Silvergate, and whether the company would face a margin call if bitcoin fell to a certain level.  As of March 31, the original cost basis and market value of MicroStrategy’s bitcoins were $3.97 billion and $5.89 billion, respectively, reflecting an average cost per bitcoin of about $30,700 and a market price per bitcoin of $45,602.79, respectively. MicroStrategy holds just over 129,000 bitcoins, according to its latest earnings release.  Shares of MicroStrategy have fallen about 63% this year while bitcoin has fallen about 36% during the same period.

Those who have been around long enough to recall previous meltdowns of more than 50% in less than a month can attest that this is just another hiccup.

I’m Brad Keoun, here to take you through the latest in crypto markets, news and insights. (Lyllah Ledesma is off this week.)  Price Point: Bitcoin steadied just below $30,000, though Solana's SOL and Cardano's ADA were nursing bigger losses.  Market Moves: Traditional markets are looking weak, and that's not a good sign for cryptocurrencies, given the strengthening correlations between U.S. stocks and bitcoin – effectively the bellwether for digital-asset markets, Shaurya Malwa reports.  Feature: A crypto wallet linked to the South Korean venture fund Hashed appears to have lost some $3.5 billion in value amid last week's collapse in prices for the Terra blockchain's LUNA tokens, Sam Reynolds reports.  Price Point  Bitcoin (BTC) was holding steady after a 5.7% drop on Wednesday that took the price back below $30,000 – increasingly a crucial level in the struggle to avoid a deeper sell-off.  The largest cryptocurrency was up 1.4% in the past 24 hours to about $29,427 as of press time. Ether (ETH), the second-biggest, lost 3.6% to $1,956. Solana’s SOL and Cardano’s ADA were nursing bigger losses.  But the mood in traditional markets remains grim, with U.S. stock futures trading lower on growing concerns that higher interest rates and fast-rising inflation will seriously dent the economy. The Wall Street Journal Editorial Board warned of a possible looming crisis in emerging markets, as analysts and economists begin to assess the possibility of mounting debt-payment issues in the face of higher borrowing costs.  Market Moves  By Shaurya Malwa  Waning sentiment around strong economic growth caused the second day of sell-offs in broader markets on Thursday morning.  Asian markets slide following a day of red in U.S. equities, leading to sell-offs in bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies.  The weakness in global markets rose amid fears of lower spending in the coming years as the West ramps up interest rates and tightens monetary policies.  Price movements in cryptocurrencies have lately tracked U.S. traditional markets, with bitcoin trading similar to a risky technology stock. And as fears grow over the precarious state of traditional markets, bitcoin continues to come under pressure.  Inflation is forcing consumers to spend more on food and less on discretionary items, as reported, with Walmart (WMT) cutting profit forecasts on Wednesday, citing higher fuel and worker costs.  U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has pledged to keep tightening monetary conditions until inflation comes down, with some crypto analysts expecting a further correction in cryptocurrencies should current market conditions continue.

News Analysis: Despite Recent Bumps in the Road, Stablecoins Will Stick Around Why institutional investors will again move past digital assets’ volatility and bad headlines.  Feature: Hashed Wallet Takes $3.5B Hit; Delphi Discloses Loss After Terra Collapse  By Sam Reynolds  The collapse of the tokens linked to the Terra ecosystem, stablecoin terraUSD (UST) and luna (LUNA), has led to some major investors coming clean and detailing their losses.  Take Hashed, an early-stage venture fund based in Seoul, South Korea. The company played a part in Terra’s 2021 venture round, where it helped raise $25 million, according to Crunchbase data.  “We were immediately impressed with the sophistication of their mechanical design and execution speed,” Hashed wrote about Terra in 2019. “They’ve done a superb job executing: building product, hiring, facilitating and interacting with the community, and more.”  Publicly, Hashed has said that they are “financially sound” and Hashed Ventures has not been affected by the crisis.  But on-chain data shows that the firm had staked over 27 million in LUNA on the Columbus 3 mainnet, 9.7 million in LUNA for the Columbus 4 mainnet, and 13.2 million in LUNA on the current Columbus 5 mainnet. Hashed didn't respond to a request for comment from CoinDesk by press time.  Delphi Digital, a research firm and boutique investor, admitted in a blog post that it always had concerns about the structure of UST and LUNA, but believed that the sizeable assets found in the Luna Foundation Guard would prevent the unthinkable from happening.  “We always knew something like this was possible, and we tried to stress the risks to a system like this in our research and public commentary, but the fact is we miscalculated the risk of a 'death spiral' event coming to fruition. We’ve taken some heat for this over the last week, and we deserve it. The criticism is fair and we accept it,” the firm wrote.

The recent failure of buyers and the $3 range has increased sellers&apos; aggression and allowed them to set a new local low of $1.45. Four weeks of falling after breaking and fixing the price below $3 lowered the price by 50%. That is, the main fall in the whole correction wave from October occurred after the loss of the $3 range. https://www.tradingview.com/x/bbY86heP/ What do we have at the moment? The price of XTZ stopped in a powerful liquidity zone, which had twice saved buyers. The first consolidation above this range took place in March 2020, during the triumphant fall of BTC. That is, investors who bought cryptocurrency in 2020 have now lost all their profits. This is a thesis to consider, is it worth keeping a cryptocurrency for more than six months? Given that the fall wave without corrections from April 2022 is still unbelievable that sellers will be able to break the $1.45 mark. At the moment the process of ramming the bottom is underway. During this time, buyers buy the entire offer of sellers at local lows and prepare the market for the beginning of a new wave of growth. However, so far there are no signals for the purchase of XTZ on the weekly timeframe. May 2022 turned out to be no better than 2021. So now there is no hurry and wait for the month to close.

42393818,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpBbCH,1652964600,"Despite Recent Bumps in the Road, Stablecoins Will Stick Around","Over the past week, we’ve learned that stablecoins aren’t really all that stable.  The major stablecoin terraUSD – more commonly referred to as UST – officially lost its peg to the U.S. dollar, causing a catastrophic devaluation in its accompanying cryptocurrency, LUNA. Eventually Terra’s blockchain was frozen, it was delisted from most major exchanges, and the luna coin’s value declined to zero.  This week, instability has already been noted in other major stablecoins, notably DAI.  But that doesn’t mean stablecoins themselves are a doomed concept, says Ian Epstein, president of Enigma Securities, a digital broker-dealer serving institutional wealth clients.  Stablecoins vs. algorithmic stablecoins  “We should talk about what I think of as a stablecoin versus what is really another bad idea dressed up as a stablecoin,” said Epstein. “Terra and some of these other coins may call themselves algorithmic stablecoins, but that’s really more of a fancy word for a leveraged position that purports to be the asset backing for a stablecoin.”  When the leveraged assets can no longer keep up with the stablecoin’s liabilities, the structure collapses.  It’s a scenario familiar to Epstein, who spent a decade of his career as a macro portfolio manager at Autonomy Capital.  “We see emerging markets all the time that have a peg to the U.S. dollar, but where the liabilities of the central bank do not equal the assets side of their balance sheet, their reserves,” said Epstein. “That puts excess pressure on the peg and causes the devaluation of their currency.”  Read More: Tether Cut Commercial Paper Reserve by 17% in Q1, Accountants Say  When Terra’s asset balance tipped too far towards liabilities, it caused the digital economy equivalent of a “run on the bank,” said Epstein. “These were Ponzi-like, poorly structured ideas that remind me of every other failed currency peg historically.”  Terra’s great failure was using non-dollar reserves to defend a dollar peg, according to Epstein, but other stablecoins show more promise for actual stability and staying power.  “The USD coin (or USDC) stablecoin is a money market-like digitization of the dollar run by a company called Circle,” said Epstein. “It’s quite transparent – it is truly a stable stablecoin using technology not to gain things. Circle is not trying to use tractional reserve or leverage. A digital form of the dollar serves a utility function, they’re offering that product and not trying to be overly greedy. They’re playing by the rules as they understand them. That’s a stablecoin.”  Circle uses high-quality short-term paper as an asset to back the USDC token, said Epstein.  Stablecoins have staying power  From a broker-dealer perspective, Epstein sees the value potential in a stablecoin serving as a transparent, fully backed digitized money market fund. “There’s great transparency and ease in subscribing to it and it provides a great value, as will other true stablecoins similar to USDC that will come about in other currencies over the next six to 12 months.”  Epstein’s institutional clients are also closely scrutinizing the stablecoin space. As interest rates and yields increase, stablecoins’ balance sheets should improve in health.  The incentive to create a true stablecoin as a regulated and transparent entity remains intact despite the negative headlines surrounding stablecoins, said Epstein.  Others, like AdvisorBId founder Brandon Spotswood, think the collapse of Terra and issues with other stablecoins will bring in stricter regulation and may cause central banks to accelerate work on their own digital currencies.  DeFi: Another area of interest  It might be hard to wrap your brain around institutional interest in decentralized finance (DeFi), technology built to disintermediate the financial transactions that have built many of the world’s financial institutions, but Epstein said the interest is there.  Read More: The Collapse of UST and LUNA Was Devastating, but There Is Still Hope for Crypto  Institutions are drawn to DeFi by the efficiencies created by smart contracts, which make possible a trustless exchange with no third-party intermediaries ensuring the exchange of assets, and instantaneous settlement of transactions at any time.  “Think about all the economic rents that are derived by firms engaged in that sort of activity, and it was a very important activity, creating trust bridges,” said Epstein. “Now, smart contracts do that for us automatically. Think about how long it takes to settle a transaction, and what percentage of the year the market is open. Everything will now settle instantaneously, markets can function for 100% of the year, and decentralized finance makes it all possible. There’s a lot of value in that, and it has nothing to do with algorithmic stablecoins.”  Institutions still take baby steps  Along with the stunning collapse of UST and LUNA, the crypto space continues to experience volatile price swings – an issue that may play into the hands of sophisticated investors like the hedge funds, asset managers and other institutions served by Enigma.  These investors are still gearing up their crypto efforts and building investment mandates, said Epstein, and most of them suffered few losses in the recent downdraft as they have yet to put most of their capital to work.  “For major institutions, they’re no more affected in digital assets than they are right now in fixed income, where credit markets have had a difficult run, or in technology, which is also down a fair bit, or in emerging markets which are down as well,” said Epstein. “There are some concerns that the prices and valuations they were looking at previously were going to be difficult to justify. With a repricing of these markets, in some ways it’s to their advantage as they are further along in their aggregation of human intellectual and financial capital to put to work in this space.”  Financial capital moves quickly, said Epstein, especially in frothy markets as it tries to find safety and value. Human capital is more likely to tell the full story.  “Never before have I seen so much human capital aggregated into one space – financial capital always goes into all kinds of things, markets go up and down – but human capital, sheer geniuses moving into a space and thinking about ways to leverage the technology, that is the most important sociocultural phenomenon in digital assets,” said Epstein. “Because of that, institutional interest and adoption will not abate. The price of bitcoin [BTC] is of less importance.”  Read More: LFG Reserves Dwindle to Just 313 Bitcoins From 80K After UST Crash",NEGATIVE,LUNA | USDC,FIAT | LUNA | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | USDC,Christopher Robbins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/05/19/despite-recent-bumps-in-the-road-stablecoins-will-stick-around,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/965aad1188ad25bd8a2773b8064eada468e7ad7c-2048x1573.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The loss of buyers&apos; control over the $8.5 range has exacerbated NEAR cryptocurrency. In the previous analysis, we allowed the fall to fall into this range, but sellers were much more aggressive. And although the global trend line that buyers have been keeping since November 2020 is still relevant, the persuasiveness of sellers is alarming. https://www.tradingview.com/x/BMKzcXms/ Over the last seven trading weeks on the NEAR market, trading volumes are the highest in the history of its trading. This means that the global sale of cryptocurrency continues. Given the closing of the weekly candle from 9 May, there is no certainty that sellers will stop there and will not try to update the local low. So now you need to closely monitor the range of $5. If buyers can not keep this mark - you should think about the breakdown of the global trend line and test of $4. Keeping the $5 range will allow buyers to start a new growth wave with the final target of $8.5.

The Merge refers to Ethereum’s long-awaited move to a proof-of-stake network from its current proof-of-work design. After the shift, transactions on the Ethereum blockchain would be processed and validated by stakers instead of miners, which would, in turn, create a faster and “eco-friendly” network.  Switching the blockchain from one consensus mechanism to another is a complex change, which requires multiple tests on testnets like Ropsten before they are finally deployed on the mainnet.  Separately, Ethereum developers increased bug bounties to up to $500,000 worth of ether (ETH) or dai (DAI) earlier this week. These are awarded to developers who find vulnerabilities or bugs on Ethereum on both public testnets and the mainnet.  The Ropsten merge is expected to take place on June 8. Estimates for a rollout on mainnet are in the final quarter of this year. A few features, such as the ability to withdraw staked ETH, however, will have to wait for until after the Merge is complete.  The new development failed to provide much of a bid for ether, however, as broader macro fears continue to hold sway on all risk markets. Ether is down 5% over the past 24 hours to $1,960 alongside a nearly 5% decline in the Nasdaq on Monday, and a 1% drop in Nasdaq futures ahead of Thursday's market open.",NEUTRAL,ETH | DAI,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | DAI,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/05/19/ethereum-on-track-for-testnet-merge-in-june,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/db40fcd58713ee1b8b3fc841bfbd46fb41a74ad1-5616x3744.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

As tweeted by the Shiba Inu transaction tracker @Shibburn, this is because the coin is being sent to dead-end wallets. The platform also burns Shiba Inu to help keep the supply down. Most of this massive amount of SHIB was destroyed in just one hour. Related Reading | Blockchain Data Indicates $10M Worth Of Ether From The Ronin Exploit In Rotation In a tweet on May 18, Shibburn communicated that a truly astonishing 10,028,551,985 Shiba Inu tokens had been shifted to unspendable wallets in six exchanges a few hours earlier.

42423281,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2YC3h,1652961600,NY Bitcoin Miners Start to Give Up on State Amid Regulatory Uncertainty,"New York's bitcoin mining companies are increasingly considering abandoning their aspirations in what was once a promised land as the state's legislature considers a bill to ban new mining projects that use carbon-based energy sources pending a review of the industry's environmental impact.  The New York state Senate is looking at a bill calling for a two-year moratorium on new crypto mining projects that use gas, coal or other nonrenewable energy sources, after the Assembly version of the bill passed the state’s lower house last month.  “All cryptocurrency companies have a permanent hold on starting businesses in New York due to the political and regulatory ambiguity. If the bill were to pass, New York would become a permanent afterthought for the industry,” said Kyle Schneps, director of public policy at Foundry, one of the largest miners in the U.S., which is based in Rochester, N.Y. Foundry is owned by CoinDesk’s parent company, Digital Currency Group.  Foundry’s planned expansions in the state “will be curtailed along with hiring,"" Schneps said.  The bill, which passed to the state Senate in late April, calls for a moratorium on proof-of-work mining powered by nonrenewable sources, the type used in the Bitcoin network, in the state while its environmental impact is assessed.  Most crypto mining companies are staying away from the state because of authorities’ seemingly negative stance toward the industry, said Whit Gibbs, CEO of Compass Mining, a marketplace that matches miners with investors around the world.  Didar Bekbauov, co-founder of Kazakhstan-based miner Xive.io, who wants to expand operations into the U.S., told CoinDesk that he is leaning toward Texas because of favorable regulation and the availability of cheap electricity.  Prices are going up  Regulatory uncertainty, including the bill, is one reason why mining firms are less likely to move to New York, one executive from a local mining hosting firm told CoinDesk. Increases in energy prices are another reason. The executive attributed the uptick in electricity rates to global macro events such as the conflict in Ukraine as well as the growing cost of complying with renewable energy mandates in New York. The executive asked not to be identified, citing fear of retribution from environmental advocates and local officials.  This bill sends a “clear message to the crypto industry that New York is closed for business,” Schneps said. It “sets a dangerous precedent” and is a case of “government overreach” in that it limits a new industry’s right to energy, thus dooming the industry to failure, he said.  While the bill targets only mining operations that use fossil fuels, those that use renewable energy are wondering if they are next, John Olsen, who leads New York policy at advocacy group the Blockchain Association, told CoinDesk. The original language of the bill called for a moratorium on all types of mining, he said.  “Any kind of moratorium in statute is problematic because it can always be expanded or extended,” Olsen said.  Miners that Valkyrie Investments has spoken to think that “passing such regulations would likely cause them to reconsider New York going forward,” said Steven McClurg, the asset management firm’s chief investment officer. But “as the situation stands now,” renewable energy-powered mines don’t have “much reason” to move elsewhere, he said.  Read more: Can Crypto Miners Make the World Greener?  Coinmint, which operates a bitcoin mine with 435 megawatts of power capacity at a former aluminum smelter in Massena, N.Y., refused to comment on the bill specifically. But CEO David Fogel said its New York subsidiary operates “in an environmentally responsible way by using renewable hydroelectric power.""  New York’s flip flop  Investments in mining in New York predate the exodus of miners from China, and the state is now at the epicenter of a debate about how to regulate miners in the U.S.  The state is rich in hydroelectric power; 80% of the electricity produced by the New York Power Authority (NYPA) comes from hydro, Alex Chiaravalle, associate media relations specialist at NYPA, told CoinDesk via email on Thursday. But NYPA generates only a quarter of the state's energy, according to its website. New York also boasts some of the cheapest electricity prices for businesses in the northeastern U.S.  Read more: After Short-Lived Ban, City in Upstate NY Is Still Reckoning With Crypto Miners  Environmental concerns have followed the crypto miners, with one mine in particular the target of environmentalists’ ire: the Greenidge mine near Seneca Lake in upstate New York. It’s a 1937 coal power plant that was converted into a natural gas facility in 2014 and now houses 19,400 bitcoin mining rigs, with plans to add another 29,800 machines by the end of the year.  Environmentalists claim the mine is polluting the lake and jeopardizes the state’s carbon emissions goals. They have asked authorities and the government to deny renewal of the plant’s air pollution permits. The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation put off a decision on the issue until June 30, just two days after the primaries are scheduled to be held to nominate candidates for governor, while the state Supreme Court denied a preliminary injunction that would have stopped the mine’s operations before a decision is made.  In December of last year, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat, asked the company to provide information about its carbon footprint, saying that “mining operations at Greenidge and other plants raise concerns about their impacts on the global environment, on local ecosystems and on consumer electricity costs.” Another letter to six miners around the U.S. followed a month later.

The one analyst cited on Yahoo Finance had forecast $27.37 million. Seeking Alpha, also with one analyst, estimated $213.86 million.  Net income climbed to $69.7 million. Earnings per share were 2.7 cents, or 41 cents per ADS, the company said. Seeking Alpha cited an EPS estimate of 50 cents.  The Beijing-based company faced a ""logistics suspension"" caused by Covid-19 lockdowns in China, which delayed shipments and adversely affected its revenue for the quarter, said CEO Nangeng Zhang.  ""Looking ahead, while we are cognizant of the near-term headwinds, we are confident that our extensive experience, increasingly globalized operations, and execution capabilities put us in a solid position to navigate the current period of uncertainty,"" Zhang said.  The company held 166.96 bitcoins on its balance sheet as of March 31.  Shares of the company rose about 15% to $3.58 at market open, still 60% below its value a year ago, when they were trading around $8.50. Canaan bought $10.3 million of its own stock in the quarter, completing a $20 million share repurchase program announced in September 2021.  During the quarter, the company approved a plan to buy up to $100 million of its own stock in the 24 months starting March 16, 2022.  For the full year, Canaan posted a $361.2 million profit, compared with a $31.5 million loss in 2020.  At the Bitcoin Conference in Miami in April, the mining machine maker released a new model, the Avalon 1266, which rakes in 100 terahash/second (TH/s) of computing power at 35 joules per terahash (J/T) of power efficiency.

The capital will help fund Azra’s first game, a science fiction/fantasy collectibles and mass combat role-playing game code-named Project Arcanas.  A16z invested in Sacramento, Calif.-based Azra Games through its crypto fund and its new $600 million games fund that was announced on Wednesday. Azra was co-founded by entrepreneurs Sonny Mayugba, who serves as chief operating officer, and Travis Boudreaux, along with veteran game designer and Electronic Arts (EA) alumnus Mark Otero, who serves as CEO.  ""CEO Mark Otero is a seasoned game director who was at the forefront of mobile free-to-play games with the hit franchise Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes,” said 16z general partner Jonathan Lai in the press release that announced the funding. “We’re excited to partner with Mark and the Azra team as they apply their expertise to Web 3 games in creating new types of gameplay and economy design.”  Capital plans  Other participants in the seed financing included NFX, Coinbase Ventures, Play Ventures and Franklin Templeton. Azra will continue to expand its 24-person team with focuses on game product and development and brand building, Mayugba told CoinDesk in an interview.  Otero, the CEO, told CoinDesk that “we have a rather large innovation budget. And what I mean by that is we really want to revisit all the assumptions of what it means to be a collectable toys plus combat RPG game. To do that takes time … [and] a lot of smart people to go away from existing established conventions to invent new things. And that obviously comes with cost.”  Project Arcanas  Project Arcanas is a fantasy combat arena game where players battle for wealth and power. Participants can garner non-fungible token-based collectibles and build out legions for combat and rewards.  “As a kid, I spent countless hours role playing with all of my different toys,” Otero said in the press release. “At Azra, we are making a game to recreate this joy, to re-engage adults’ imaginations once again with the ultimate collectibles fantasy, combined with the ultimate fast-paced mix-and-match combat that is accessible yet deeply strategic.”  Azra has been working on the game for over four months, trying to create a visually attractive, fun game that’s also accessible for players.  “We’re doing a lot of exploration on the economy. We certainly studied all of the play-to-earn games out there and, quite frankly, we’re not satisfied with what we see,” Otera said. “We’re starting from a place where the first thing we’re going to do is really … focus on the collection and focus on the value of the things that you can collect within the world.“  Road map  Azra has announced that users will be able to collect NFT profile pics called Play Forever Passes (PFP) that will essentially act as game passes as the team builds out the Project Arcanas universe. The company will release the first PFPs with gamification – called Genesis Explorers – within the next several months. Azra plans to release teaser footage of the collectible toy battle experience for the game by the end of next year.  There are plans for additional games within the brand, which Azra views more as game slices of a whole ecosystem pie rather than mini-games.  “We have a very long-term view of the innovations we’re building and the brand that we’re building.

42423278,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2YBth,1652957669,Curve Finance Proposes to End CRV Token Emissions on All UST Pools,"Stablecoin swap application Curve Finance is proposing to end emissions of its CRV tokens from pools related to terraUSD (UST) after UST's implosion last week.  An on-chain governance proposal floated early on Thursday pointed out that technical risks associated with using UST on Curve pools made it problematic for users and retail participants.  “Due to the current circumstances, i.e., UST trading 90% off-peg and Terra ecosystem having approx. $9B in bad debts, there is currently no prospect of a sustainable recovery of the peg,” the proposal stated.  “Furthermore it is yet unclear as to how exactly weaknesses were exploited and if these vulnerability vectors will persist even in the case of a successful bailout,” it added, referring to revival plans floated by Terra founder Do Kwon.  The proposal further pointed out that Curve pools involving UST could act as a way for opportunistic investors to attract exit liquidity for their failed investments.  Developers, however, explained the proposal came amid technical risks instead of any negative notions of being associated with Terra.  ""This is more technical than any kind of judgment of UST/Terra,"" Frax Finance founder Sam Kazemian wrote in a Twitter message. ""The stablecoin is not pegged, so it literally cannot stay or be inside Curve pools until/if it ever repegs.""  What are Curve and UST?  Depositors on Curve earn annual yields of up to 4% from one of the many pools on the platform. Curve offers an efficient way to exchange stablecoins while maintaining low fees and low slippage, according to developer documents.  UST, a stablecoin pegged to U.S. dollar, plunged to a few cents last week as investors redeemed UST for other tokens, causing a death spiral and pushing UST off its peg. That led to billions of dollars in losses for investors while creating negative sentiment for the Terra ecosystem among community members.  A drop in UST affected related decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, such as the 4pool on Curve.  4pool was launched in early April and is composed of two decentralized stablecoins, UST and Frax Finance's FRAX, and two centralized stablecoins, USD coin (USDC) and tether (USDT). Vocal backers included Terra's Kwon, who even tweeted that the 4pool’s “goal is to starve 3pool,” the biggest Curve pool.  It worked until it didn’t: Liquidity on the 4pool lingers at a few thousand dollars at writing time, instead of the millions its creators hoped for.  If the proposal is passed, CRV emissions from all pools involving UST would be ended, effectively ending all incentives for anyone to provide their UST to Curve. And the consensus seems to agree as100% of all voters have voted to end CRV emissions from UST-related pools at writing time, data shows.",NEGATIVE,CRV,BUSINESS | CRV | LUNA | MINING | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/05/19/curve-finance-proposes-to-end-crv-token-emissions-on-all-ust-pools,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cb30ccf8972a3c3f4fcced11d11ad6d68ffb3539-4000x2500.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Two more backers of Terra are disclosing exactly how their balance sheets have been affected.  Delphi Digital, a research firm and boutique investor, said in a blog post that it always had concerns about the structure of UST and LUNA, but believed that the sizable reserves in the Luna Foundation Guard, a nonprofit that supports the Terra network, would prevent the unthinkable from happening.  “We always knew something like this was possible, and we tried to stress the risks to a system like this in our research and public commentary, but the fact is we miscalculated the risk of a ‘death spiral’ event coming to fruition. We’ve taken some heat for this over the last week, and we deserve it. The criticism is fair and we accept it,” the firm wrote.  The firm wrote that in the first quarter of 2021, Delphi Ventures Master Fund purchased a small amount of LUNA, worth 0.5% of its net asset value (NAV) at the time. That position grew as LUNA’s value increased and the fund increased its holdings, including a $10 million investment in the LFG’s funding round in February. That investment is now worthless.  While Delphi said that it didn’t sell any LUNA, it’s now sitting on “a large unrealized loss.”  Delphi was once a believer in the LFG’s ability to counterbalance any risks from the LUNA-UST relationship, but ultimately, LFG’s holdings weren't enough to be an effective backstop once the price of bitcoin (BTC) began to quickly decline earlier in the quarter. The foundation had purchased a large amount of bitcoin to help support LUNA and UST.  “We believed a high level of external collateralization was a necessity in the long run, and we saw this as a path to get there. Unfortunately, it didn’t grow fast enough compared to UST supply, and, combined with a fall in value of the BTC reserves, the liability overhang was too large to be defended,” Delphi wrote.  Hashed hit hard  One of Terra’s other prominent backers is Hashed, an early-stage venture fund based in Seoul, South Korea. The company invested in TerraForm Labs’ $25 million venture round in 2021, according to Crunchbase data.  “We were immediately impressed with the sophistication of their mechanical design and execution speed,” Hashed wrote about Terra in 2019. “They’ve done a superb job executing: building product, hiring, facilitating and interacting with the community, and more.”  Publicly, Hashed has said that it is “financially sound” and Hashed Ventures hasn’t been affected by the crisis.  Hashed didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment, but on-chain data shows that the firm had staked over 27 million in LUNA on the Columbus 3 mainnet, 9.7 million in LUNA for the Columbus 4 mainnet and 13.2 million in LUNA on the current Columbus 5 mainnet.  All in all, Hashed’s losses amount to over $3.5 billion using pricing data from early April.  Local media in South Korea report that more than 200,000 investors in the country hold Terra-related tokens.  South Korea’s newly elected president, Yoon Suk-yeol, is pro-crypto and has promised a regulatory framework for the asset class, which analysts say will likely be introduced at an accelerated pace given the scale of the crisis caused by Terra.",NEGATIVE,BTC | LUNA,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | LUNA | RESEARCH,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/05/19/terra-backers-delphi-digital-and-hashed-lick-their-wounds-after-ust-and-luna-collapse,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/40f939bedcaf5145c61a7a13e29d8f6dce8c0262-761x442.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Worries of contagion risk within the crypto ecosystem and spillover effects in traditional financial markets due to the collapse of algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD (UST) are also unfounded, the bank said, though the slump probably contributed to recent volatility in bitcoin (BTC).  UST is not backed by traditional assets and the loss of its peg shows the durability of the wider stablecoin market, because the largest stablecoins maintained theirs, it added.  Bank of America says the collapse of the Terra network was due to its prioritization of UST’s adoption over its price stability. While the bank is not positive about UST revival plans, it still sees the potential for a successful algorithmic stablecoin.  Stablecoin regulation is expected to lead to increased disclosures for algorithmic stablecoins, but an outright ban seems unlikely, the note said.  Banning algorithmic stablecoins would be “premature” and could slow the ecosystem’s growth, it added.

The company did not provide a timeline for wider rollout.  The launch comes as FTX makes an aggressive push into the traditional financial ecosystem. Its explosion across the U.S. has emboldened the trading firm with roots as an offshore crypto derivatives exchange to challenge the closely-guarded rules governing commodities markets.  That effort, which is currently being examined by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), has long-term potential. But the stock trading is one more sign that FTX US is growing more interested in the general investor crowd than exclusively crypto gamblers.  FTX US will not charge commissions or trading fees in keeping with the low-cost brokerage model that Robinhood (HOOD) rode to fame. it will not monetize traders’ orders by selling the flow to high-frequency traders, a controversial practice called payment for order flow for which Robinhood has been criticized.  (FTX CEO Bankman-Fried recently disclosed he purchased 7% of Robinhood in a stock buy.)  The exchange also plans to let its customers fund their accounts in the stablecoin USDC.

42423288,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2YCDh,1652953914,How Do You Tax an NFT?,"New global tax reporting rules could soon extend into crypto, non-fungible tokens (NFT) and decentralized finance (DeFi), but some worry the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development’s (OECD) inflexible framework threatens to constrain a sector that’s still moving fast.  Proposals set out by the international organization in March require details of crypto holdings to be shared with foreign tax authorities. But blockchain and tax experts have told CoinDesk they’re concerned the rules are neither well adapted nor well coordinated with the other waves of regulations set to hit the sector.  The OECD, which sets international guidelines on major tax issues, wants new rules to prevent tax evasion by anyone trying to keep their bitcoin (BTC) hidden overseas, mirroring the procedures that already apply to foreign bank accounts.  In a March consultation document, OECD proposed that crypto providers would have to report to the authorities whenever crypto transactions are made, such as exchanging bitcoin for fiat. That information will then be sent back to the taxman in the owner’s country of residence. The OECD also proposes extending existing banking rules to cover new means of payment such as electronic money and central bank digital currencies.  It’s easy to see how even well-meaning changes designed to deal with conventional finance that involve regulated intermediaries might fail to deal with the reality of distributed ledger technology. Witness recent controversies over how to apply money-laundering rules, intended to curb dirty money by getting crypto users to prove their identity, to unhosted crypto wallets.  At a meeting due in Paris on May 23, some industry advocates may plead for a rethink of plans they say could strangle growth, while others are merely hoping the rules can be streamlined to avoid too much administrative heartache.  Read more: Crypto Providers Would Have to Swap Transaction Details Under OECD Tax-Dodging Proposal  The OECD proposal to extend the existing information-swapping system to virtual assets was expected and, in some cases, welcomed. Tax collectors want to ensure crypto currency gets treated the same as Swiss bank accounts – once famed for their absolute discretion, but no longer.  It’s clear why officials might be concerned. According to a May 11 research note from Barclays (BCS), in the U.S. only around half of crypto taxes due are correctly declared. The note estimates the country’s crypto tax shortfall to be about $50 billion, or 10% of the total the Internal Revenue Service is missing. In a May 17 speech, U.K. minister Lucy Frazer welcomed the OECD’s plans.  But some were surprised at how far the OECD wants to extend existing measures beyond currency holdings like bitcoin and ether (ETH) into the Web 3 space – in a way seen as unfair and potentially harmful.  “What they propose is very onerous regulation, much more so than for the traditional sector,” Luzius Meisser, founder of the Bitcoin Suisse association, told CoinDesk. “That's an unfair burden for the crypto sector.”  Applying the rules to non-fungible tokens is hard to do as – unlike gold or stocks – for a given token at a given time you don’t always know its value, he said. But it also means your Bored Apes get treated differently than their offline equivalents because a regular art collector wouldn’t, under current rules, see his paintings reported to the authorities.  Worse still is if the rules are made to apply to fast-developing, and hence less well-defined, sectors such as decentralized finance.  “Their DeFi rules are based on vague definitions, which, of course, hurts legal certainty,” Meisser said.  “There's a strong tendency to control everything,” he said, with a corresponding cost to economic growth. “The various barriers and friction introduced by this kind of regulation is particularly harmful for innovative sectors.”  ‘Ill-conceived’  Regulators often get into trouble when they try to apply old rules to a new sector – and here’s no different. Tax reporting conventions are built on the assumption there’s an intermediary, namely a bank, that takes charge of identifying and reporting customer details to the authorities. But in crypto land that’s not always the case.  It’s a problem the OECD wants to come to grips with. “The ability of individuals to hold Crypto-Assets in wallets unaffiliated with any service provider, and transfer such Crypto-Assets across jurisdictions, poses a risk that Crypto-Assets will be used for illicit activities or to evade tax obligations,” the Paris-based organization said in its March 22 consultation document.  In jurisdictions like the European Union, lawmakers have already tied themselves in knots trying to figure out how to apply anti-money laundering rules to wallets where custody isn’t offered by any regulated crypto-asset service provider.  Read more: EU Parliament Passes Privacy-Busting Crypto Rules Despite Industry Criticism  It’s just as unclear what is supposed to be done with tax – for instance, in cases where a person uses an unhosted wallet to make a small payment in a store.  “The most ill-conceived requirement they have is to make service providers like BitPay responsible for identifying whoever buys something from one of their connected merchants,” Meisser said.  “You don't want to send in a copy of your passport and file identification forms just for buying a piece of bread,” he added. ""It's completely unrealistic.""  The OECD’s Common Reporting System (CRS), which in the U.S. takes the form of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA), was introduced almost a decade ago, intended to make it harder to conceal foreign interest and dividends from the taxman.  Though the OECD comprises major developed countries, it persuaded jurisdictions such as the Cayman Islands and Liechtenstein – small, but significant for tax dodging – to join in, too.  At least part of the motivation for the OECD’s work is to ensure crypto doesn’t end up a loophole that makes those rules pointless – and that’s welcomed by banks, who bear the brunt of administering the current system.  “It fully makes sense that there is a level playing field and that the CRS is extended,” Roger Kaiser, a senior policy adviser at the European Banking Federation, told CoinDesk.  “To a certain extent you can see a loophole in the reporting framework as unfair competition,” he said. “The loopholes must be closed; otherwise, it doesn't make sense to impose such requirements.”  But exactly how you do that is still up for grabs. Kaiser hopes it doesn’t mean creating new overlaps or inconsistencies – not least as banks no longer see crypto as a rival financial system, but as something they’ll need to get on board with.  “I already see the difference from the positioning we had one year ago,” Kaiser said. “We were talking in terms of potential competitors and now we are thinking of whether this new framework can impact us if we are providers.”  The worst outcome of all would be to create a new parallel system that repeats without precisely replicating – meaning banks must follow slightly different procedures, for example, to certify their clients’ identities depending on whether they hold crypto or fiat.  Welcome?  Tax experts appear to agree the new rules are needed, and see it as part of crypto’s integration into the mainstream economy.  “In my world, there is a strong desire to bring this [crypto] into the fold, to make sure it's ethical, it works, people are trusted, there's consumer protection, there's not money laundering associated with it,” KPMG’s Grant Wardell-Johnson told CoinDesk.  But doing that could mean a slew of regulations about to hit the crypto sector – and, with the Financial Action Task Force already setting laundering norms and other international bodies potentially looking at areas like financial stability and consumer protection, Wardell-Johnson hopes to see a more joined-up approach.  “If you end up with multiples of rules in relation to each of those domains, multiplied by many regions and countries, it will become a nightmare,” said Wardell-Johnson, who is global tax policy lead at the accounting firm.  Different regulators “are at different stages, and they've got different mindsets,” Wardell-Johnson said. “You need to try and have consistent definitions, and if one reporting obligation occurs then that information should be able to be used for other reporting obligations, to the extent possible, rather than duplication.”  In some areas, he notes, fiscal norms openly conflict with innovations like DeFi. Where you’re taxed often depends on where you’re resident or registered, but that’s hard to determine for a nebulous software protocol. Wardell-Johnson suggested simply tweaking the rules to focus on where the customers of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) are located.  But that’s just another illustration of how crypto tech doesn’t always map onto conventional regulations – and how the blockchain can mess with public policy procedures.  That can represent a risk – crypto data sharing is more likely to be hacked, and so needs greater security, Wardell-Johnson said – but canny regulators can also use the opportunities of public ledgers; for instance, letting tax collectors inspect crypto-wallet addresses directly.  The OECD plans say that “if a country demands it, the addresses of users should be reported, allowing them to follow the flow of your funds on the blockchain,” Meisser of Bitcoin Suisse said. “This is the only idea of the proposal that leverages the openness of blockchain technology.”  “This sounds like a privacy nightmare,” he said. “But I think it would be more desirable than shoehorning decentralized protocols into traditional structures and thereby destroying the value of disintermediation.”  Meisser moves beyond mere technical quibbles to ask if the OECD’s whole approach isn’t an overreaction, equivalent to introducing special rules for monitoring Apple (AAPL) stock – which, he notes, has a bigger market capitalization than the whole crypto universe.  “Crypto is still very far from taking over the financial system,” he said. “So the fear that crypto could be used to hide wealth at a globally relevant scale is not well-founded.""  Detax  Meisser argues that, rather than intrusive new rules, it would be better to simply remove taxes from crypto entirely, as the U.S. did for e-commerce sales tax in the 1990s. Yet, global consensus on a zero tax rate seems far off: even agreeing on a framework for how to treat crypto would be a stretch.  “Can we get an agreement for all countries on how to tax crypto? … Certainly not for a very long period of time,” Wardell-Johnson said, citing the vast divergence in approaches reported by the OECD in a 2020 report.  Some have argued that, before hauling taxpayers over the coals for getting their sums wrong, the OECD needs to wait until there's greater clarity on the substantive tax rules in each jurisdiction.  That’s already happening in some cases – such as the German guidance issued Wednesday that sets out the tax rules that apply when you mine currencies, lend bitcoin or redeem a utility token – but not yet everywhere.  “The tax treatment of Crypto-Assets may be either unclear, or poorly understood, by users depending on the maturity of their domestic tax authority,” lobby group Global Digital Finance (GDF), whose members include Coinbase (COIN) and the London Stock Exchange, said in a written submission to the OECD.  “Collecting information about users without establishing a clear tax treatment for assets is likely to be inherently unfair for taxpayers,” it added.  That plea follows unexpected surprises in jurisdictions like the U.K., where a recent guide on how the tax authority wants to treat DeFi lending led to an industry outcry.  Meisser agrees the OECD shouldn’t rush, saying it would be better to postpone the rules until they’re less likely to disproportionately harm the sector.  So far, the work has moved relatively slowly – perhaps because tax officials have been preoccupied with a much more wide-ranging reform of international corporation tax rules. Even once agreed, banks would need a couple of years to put new crypto rules in effect, Kaiser said.  But the issue of crypto taxation isn’t going to go away, and once rules are in place, we might be stuck with them for a very long time.  “Once you’ve got the definitions in place, from the OECD ... it's very hard to change those at the edges,” KPMG’s Wardell-Johnson said, adding that any attempt to make the rules more flexible now could also make them less legally certain.  “Future proofing this is going to be difficult,” he said.

42423274,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2YBlh,1652951286,"Nomura’s Digital Division to Focus on Cryptocurrencies First, DeFi Later","Nomura’s (NMR) new digital-asset subsidiary, announced earlier this week in a move that potentially catapults the Japanese investment bank ahead of U.S. and European rivals, will start by focusing on cryptocurrencies, the unit’s newly appointed CEO Jez Mohideen said.  Only later will the division, which will be based in Europe and given a title in the coming months, look into more exotic applications such as decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).  “To start with, I would say the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization we will be looking at opportunistically for market making and client services,” Mohideen said in an interview. “Then basically, we’ll go down further the market cap chain to see the opportunity based on institutional demand. So, also looking at DeFi protocols, if these get launched in our own launch pads, we will look to make markets there as well.”  While banks have been testing the crypto waters for some time, many have restricted themselves to trading, whether derivatives or exchange-traded products, or conducting research into various types of digital assets. Nomura was one of the first to explore safekeeping of crypto assets through the Komainu custody consortium, alongside investment fund CoinShares and storage specialist Ledger, and is also one of the first to say it plans to delve deeper into the ecosystem.  “Komainu is one of our first projects, where we learned a lot about the bottlenecks of this industry,” said Mohideen. “It’s one of our portfolio companies and, where necessary, we will of course leverage and use that solution.”  Know your DeFi  Nomura’s take on DeFi will similarly be focused on institutionalization. That’s because companies need to be able to identify their trading counterparties to be compliant with anti-money laundering (AML) regulations. As such, they tend toward DeFi pools that offer know-your-customer (KYC) and white listing, like Aave Arc, for example.  “We will be aiming to bring trust into this ecosystem,” Mohideen said.  NFT’s will feature in a later phase, and only as a carefully weighed commercial opportunity focused on the overlap between so-called Web 3 and traditional finance (TradFi), according to Mohideen.  “It’s at an early stage with NFTs, but we want to explore the infrastructure side, whether it’s collateral financing and seeing the opportunity that exists there,” he said.  Tectonic Terra  Mohideen declined to say which stablecoins might be incorporated within Nomura’s crypto business. The cryptocurrency industry was shaken last week by the collapse of the algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD (UST).  “I think any true stablecoin needs to be fully backed by fiat and collateral,” Mohideen said. “They will need to be correctly audited and that will bring its own risk rating. Based on that, we will make our choices.”  As for the effect on the wider market, Mohideen said many people may be asking, “is this the right time to go into crypto?”  “This is a tectonic shift,” Mohideen said. “It takes time, and maturity comes with events like last week. It’s where weakness in the system will be corrected and also in some cases it will require further, tighter regulation. It’s never good when people lose money, but this should speed up the institutionalization of this asset class.”",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/05/19/nomuras-digital-division-to-focus-on-cryptocurrencies-first-defi-later,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6c1ad7174db8cb05566df1d22a6616744dadf017-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

But, still, the mining stocks have seen declines in the last month, with Bitcoin prices going down. The concluded figure involves BTC.com, Via BTC, and Pooling data. Cryptocurrency mining involves verifying and broadcasting the transactions on the relative blockchain ledger. It is a computationally-intensive process that opens doors for validators (who validate transactions) to earn rewards. Validators verify the transaction by guessing a unique hash number associated with each transaction. And it requires computing power more than simple PCs.

Asian markets slid following a day of red in U.S. equities, leading to sell-offs in bitcoin (BTC) and other major cryptocurrencies.  Bitcoin failed to regain support at $30,000 after falling below that level on Wednesday. The asset is hovering at over $29,000, with support at $27,000 should it lose current levels.  Weakness in bitcoin spread to other major cryptos, with Solana’s SOL and Cardano’s ADA losing as much as 9% in the past 24 hours to lead losses. Traders are likely selling risky assets like cryptocurrencies in anticipation of a further drop in global markets.  Price movements in cryptocurrencies have lately tracked those in the U.S. stock markets, with bitcoin trading similarly to a risky technology stock.  Ether (ETH) declined by 4%, Polkadot’s DOT fell 7%, and dogecoin (DOGE) dropped 5%. Tron (TRX) gained a nominal 0.2%, while Polygon (MATIC) erased Wednesday’s gains with a 9% slump.  Crypto market capitalization decreased by 3% to under $1.3 trillion. The slide tracked a slump in U.S. markets on Wednesday, which came as Target (TGT) reported quarterly earnings that missed estimates, sending the giant retailer's shares plunging by more than 22%.  Inflation is forcing consumers to spend more on food and less on discretionary items, as reported, with Walmart (WMT) cutting its profit forecasts on Wednesday, citing higher fuel and worker costs.  Weak earnings in the U.S. carried over to the Asian session led by weakness in Chinese technology stocks. India’s Sensex and the Asia Dow lost over 2.2%, while futures on European indexes opened nearly 0.1% lower.  Chinese tech giant Tencent posted its lowest revenue gains since 2014, and its share fell 8% on Thursday. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Tech Index dropped 5.1% as analysts feared the ill effects of lockdowns and reduced spending could finally show up in earnings reports in Asia.  The weakness in global markets comes amid fears of lower spending in the coming years as Western countries ramp up interest rates and tighten their monetary policies.  U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has pledged to keep tightening monetary conditions until inflation comes down, with some crypto analysts expecting a further correction in cryptocurrencies should current market conditions continue.",NEGATIVE,ADA | BTC | SOL,ADA | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | SOL,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/05/19/solana-cardano-tokens-slide-over-9-as-cryptos-see-weakness-amid-poor-us-consumer-data,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4b99804dab35d12e4ff5e55c3d7c96e10fbd1a3d-2273x1318.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Data Firm Kaiko Probes DEX Liquidity With New Product,"Getting a clearer picture of what’s happening within complex realms like decentralized finance (DeFi) is likely top of mind for many investors right now.  Paris-based cryptocurrency data provider Kaiko is meeting that need with the launch of a decentralized exchange (DEX) liquidity pool data feed, measuring depth of liquidity across DeFi majors like Uniswap, SushiSwap, Curve Finance and Balancer.  Trading in traditional finance or on centralized exchanges via APIs provides a window into what’s happening on an order book – something that’s not only missing from decentralized exchanges, but is also quite hard to capture, explained Kaiko product chief Bediss Cherif.  Kaiko, which raised a $24 million funding round in June of last year, already provided trade data for the four main DEX exchanges, which was gleaned from public blockchain transactions. Measuring liquidity and token reserves on platforms like Uniswap involves decoding the programs, or smart contracts, that govern order matching on those DEXs.  “Uniswap [version]3 smart contracts, for example, come with a lot of logic and mathematical rules around the upper boundary and lower boundary that’s actually embedded in the code of the smart contract and not displayed on-chain,” Cherif said in an interview. “In order to produce a proper market data feed, you need to not only capture the data of the event on-chain, but also to completely reverse-engineer the smart contract and its rules.”  As well as deciphering what happens inside a DEX, Kaiko, whose crypto market data was connected with the InterContinental Exchange (ICE) network earlier this year, also saves institutions the headache of having to run an Ethereum node, Cherif said.  “Since Kaiko is connected to the ICE global network, that means any institution that has a server in an ICE data center can get in real-time market data of Uniswap liquidity directly in their infrastructure without running a node,” he said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | UNI,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/05/19/institutional-defi-enabler-data-firm-kaiko-probes-dex-liquidity-with-new-product,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d5c257e1aab31e35afd85151a836134cfd85458e-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Presently, the rejection of higher highs and May 18 being a pin bar suggests a slowdown in the upside drive. Losses below the recent intra-day consolidation at $0.11 may trigger further sell-offs towards May 12 lows. What to Expect from CHZ? Buyers are confident. However, for CHZ buyers to take charge, there must be a comprehensive close above $0.15 and the middle BB.

It is a method of reducing the supply of a coin. Coin burning became popular around 2017 and has been duplicated almost endlessly since then. It is now a common trend in the cryptocurrency industry. The phrase &apos;coin burning&apos; conjures up ideas of an investor setting fire to real money. Of course, this is not physically feasible because digital currencies are only present in virtual form. Token burning is when a coin&apos;s creators remove a particular amount of tokens from circulation. Burning tokens has several purposes, the most common of which is to minimize the market&apos;s inflationary pressures. It is like a public company repurchasing stock. Such companies use the cash available to acquire common equity shares, reducing the total outstanding shares. This strategy increases earnings per share by boosting the value of outstanding shares. The net profit to share ratio increases. Big blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum don&apos;t employ this methodology. On the other hand, altcoins and smaller tokens commonly burn to regulate the circulating supply, further drawing in investment. But how do cryptocurrencies get burnt? Token burning has many variations, but the ultimate goal is to reduce the total number of available tokens. While you can&apos;t burn Cryptocurrency, you can make it unusable.

For over a week now, Bitcoin has been trading near its immediate support level. Over the last week, the coin lost close to 6% of its value and in the last 24 hours, BTC fell by 3%. The past week has been extremely choppy for Bitcoin and also for the altcoin due to continued market weakness. The coin had plunged to a low of $25,000, BTC had last traded about that price level in December 2020. Bitcoin has recovered by $5000, however, a chance of a further downslide cannot be ruled out. The technical of the coin pointed towards continued selling pressure in the market. Bitcoin Price Analysis: One Day Chart Bitcoin was priced at $29,100 at the time of writing after the coin was rejected from the $31,000 price level. Immediate resistance for the coin stood at $25,000. A fall beneath the same will send the coin straight to $19,000.

The volume of Bitcoin traded was seen in the red which indicated bearishness on the one day chart. Technical Analysis Bitcoin might have been able to show signs of stability on the chart but further signs show that the coin can soon plummet again.

The SEC alleged in 2013 that George Jarkesy Jr. and his firm, Patriot28 LLC, violated federal securities law by misstating his two hedge funds' assets. The case was tried before an administrative law judge rather than before a civil court. These administrative law judges, or in-house judges, may have violated Jarkesy's seventh amendment constitutional rights to a jury trial, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals said in its ruling Wednesday.  ""In sum, we agree with Petitioners that the SEC proceedings below were unconstitutional. The SEC’s judgment should be vacated for at least two reasons: (1) Petitioners were deprived of their Seventh Amendment right to a civil jury; and (2) Congress unconstitutionally delegated legislative power to the SEC by failing to give the SEC an intelligible principle by which to exercise the delegated power,"" the decision said.  The ruling remanded the case ""for further proceedings,"" indicating that it was not vacating Jarkesy's conviction entirely.  According to The New York Times, the impact of the case is limited to just SEC cases brought in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi, and only in cases that do not ""involve solely 'public rights.'""  The SEC has taken on a number of enforcement actions in the crypto industry in recent years, bolstering the part of its enforcement division responsible for such cases earlier this month to just over 50 individuals.

Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Polkadot DOT −13.5% Smart Contract Platform Polygon MATIC −13.5% Smart Contract Platform Internet Computer ICP −12.9% Computing  Cryptos plummet along with stocks  It was a red Wednesday for nearly everyone in crypto.  Red for bitcoin. Red for ether. And even deeper red for major altcoins as investors continued to defy those who say that digital assets do not track stocks.  Bitcoin was recently trading at about $28,900, within its range the past few days following the collapse of the terraUSD (UST) stablecoin and the LUNA token that supports it, but down 5% over the past 24 hours. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was off more than 8% over the same period after dropping below $2,000. Among the rest of the declining and the decrepit, SOL, AVAX, DOT, MATIC, SAND and MANA were all recently down at least 12%.  “The market is continuing its current bearish trajectory,"" Autonomy CEO James Key wrote to CoinDesk, although he noted that crypto wallet addresses with small amounts of BTC had climbed past 10 million for the first time. Still, he noted that ""institutions ... view crypto as an exotic risky asset, and as we drop into a recession, those assets are the first to be sold by those players – it was always the down side of inviting them into the crypto space.”  Equity markets had a more than forgettable day as all sectors dropped amid escalating investor fears of recession and bad news from the retail sector. The tech-focused Nasdaq plummeted 4.7%, while the S&P 500 fell 4%, their worst percentage decreases in two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged more than 1,100 points, a 3.6% drop that was its worst closing mark since mid-2021.  The retail sector has played a big role in the most recent U.S. economic recovery, and even last week the sector seemed buoyant following a strong consumer spending report. But on Tuesday, retail giant Walmart (WMT) said that its profit dropped 25% year-on-year. Target (TGT) followed Wednesday morning with its own disappointing news: sales growing just 3.3% compared with a 22% rise for the same quarter a year ago.  Bitcoin, which has struggled to hold $30,000 following the UST debacle, and the rest of the digital assets industry was swept up in the latest events. On Wednesday, London-based miner Argo Blockchain (ARBK) reported first-quarter net income of $2.1 million, a 90% falloff from the same period the previous year.  Meanwhile, in a letter posted on the company website, Mike Novogratz, the CEO of crypto merchant bank Galaxy Digital (GLXY.TO), said the company had taken profits prior to UST's crash. Pantera Capital also sold about 80% of its holdings, according to a New York Times article, citing investor Paul Veradittakit.  While remaining highly bullish on the outlook for crypto, Novogratz said those hoping for a ""V"" bottom in the market are likely to be disappointed. ""It will take restructuring, a redemption cycle, consolidation, and renewed confidence in crypto. Crypto moves in cycles, and we just witnessed a big one.""  Markets  S&P 500: $3,923 -4%  DJIA: 31,490 -3.5%  Nasdaq: 11,419 -4.7%  Gold: $1,816 +0.1%  Insights  Crypto lending platform Pine sees an opportunity in NFT markets  Art that adorns the walls of the global elite isn’t usually just to look at. They use it as a source of liquidity, too.  The team behind the Pine Protocol proposes to do something similar, but for non-fungible tokens (NFT). Fresh off closing a $1.5 million funding round led by Sino Global, Amber and Spartan Group, Pine is building a platform that allows NFT holders to access liquidity using their NFT as collateral, and a mortgage-type vehicle it is calling “Pine Now, Pay Later” for those who are looking to purchase an NFT but require financing  “A year ago, I wanted to buy a Meebit but I did not have spare ETH in my wallet. Therefore, I sold my Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) at 7 ETH to execute the trade. I wanted to buy back another BAYC but I never did and I still have my Meebit right now. In hindsight I wish I had access to a platform like Pine,” said Alex Ho, Pine’s co-founder, in a release, illustrating a use case for the platform. “I decided to build out Pine so that NFT owners like myself are able to unlock liquidity without having to sell their NFTs.”  The platform has lending pools available with different terms regarding the loan’s interest, the level at which it gets liquidated if the value drops, and the level of collateralization, Ho told CoinDesk in an interview.  One particular factor that differs between the pools is the accepted loan-to-value ratio. Pine uses the floor price (the lowest price offered) of the specific NFT collection from public data published by markets as a reference for valuation. But these are subject to the intense volatility of the crypto market. During the last two weeks, for instance, ether is down nearly 27% against the U.S. dollar, cratering valuations along the way – problematic for those lending out dollars against the asset.  How much liquidity is actually available in this market? Twenty-thousand-dollar JPEGs are very much a product of a bull market cycle but will the same value sentiment be prescribed to them in a bear market?  Crypto research house Nansen’s data suggests the number of wallets buying and selling is dipping, and the number of returning buyers and first-time buyers is also on the decline.  “The number of projects with weekly sales of over 10, 100, 1K and 10K NFTs have been on a downtrend the past week as well, signaling that there’s a drop in overall liquidity in the NFT markets,” said Martin Lee, a data journalist at Nansen, in a note to CoinDesk.  Transactions per week are 50% off an all-time high this year from around 500,000 at its peak to around 215,000.  But Lee also pointed to data that shows the number of users per week on NFT markets is the lowest it has been this year, but still higher than any time in 2021.  Nansen’s data shows there’s still weekly higher volume than in most weeks of 2021, and in the last 30 days there has been a 58% increase in volume from 941,000 ether spent per month to 1.49 million.  For Pine, expensive JPEGs – with all their questions about market volatility and liquidity – are just the start. The founders envision their asset-backed financing protocol will eventually move beyond this market to other verticals at the hands of specialized teams.  In theory, NFTs can be used to represent any sort of document of value like a house’s title, or a security agreement to finance investment in a company like a SAFT. After all, similar vehicles exist in the traditional finance world, and there’s no reason the same can’t happen for crypto – if the industry can move on from JPEGs of bored apes.  Technician's take  Bitcoin Struggles to Hold Support at $27K-$30K  Bitcoin (BTC) has traded in a tight range of between $27,000 and $30,000 over the past few days. That's a key support zone for BTC, and it is also the lower bound of a yearlong trading range.  BTC was down by as much as 3% over the past 24 hours.  A decisive break below $27,000 could yield further downside targets for BTC, initially toward $17,823. Further, BTC's downward sloping 50-day moving average indicates persistent trend weakness, which could keep sellers active.  Bitcoin faces strong resistance at between $33,000 and $36,000, which could stall an upswing in price. On the weekly chart, momentum remains negative despite oversold readings. That could increase the risk of a breakdown in price, similar to what occurred in March 2020 and November 2018.
