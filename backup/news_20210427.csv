42386587,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBU6Bp,1619566703,US Officials Arrest Alleged Operator of $336M Bitcoin Mixing Service,"U.S. officials have arrested the alleged operator of a bitcoin mixing service on allegations of laundering nearly $336 million in bitcoin over 10 years.      According to public court documents, federal agents arrested Roman Sterlingov, a Russian and Swedish citizen, on three charges stemming from his alleged involvement with bitcoin mixing service Bitcoin Fog: unlicensed money transmission, money laundering and money transmission without a license.      While the U.S. government hasn't gone after many bitcoin mixing services before, prosecutors have called such services ""a crime"" in the past.      Bitcoin Fog allows its customers to transfer bitcoin to each other while obfuscating where the coins are being sent from, according to an affidavit filed by Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Special Agent Devon Beckett. The service was launched in 2011 and has allegedly been used to transfer some 1.2 million BTC ($335.8 million based on their value when the transactions occurred). Customers apparently sent bitcoin from Silk Road, Evolution, AlphaBay, Agora and Silk Road 2.0.      Bitcoin stolen from exchanges through hacks also went through Bitcoin Fog, the affidavit claimed. However, Bitcoin Fog is not a Financial Crimes Enforcement Network-registered money services business, and was not licensed to operate within Washington, D.C..      Federal agents used blockchain analysis to determine the 1.2 million figure, as well as some of the sources for these funds, the document said.      ""While the identity of a Bitcoin address owner is generally anonymous (unless the owner opts to make the information publicly available), law enforcement can often identify the owner of a particular Bitcoin address by analyzing the blockchain,"" Beckett said in his affidavit.      An IRS agent conducted a transaction on Bitcoin Fog, finding that it was a successful mixing service. A second transaction that the IRS agent claimed was from a narcotics sale was also sent through the service.      ""Analysis of bitcoin transactions, financial records, Internet service provider records, email records and additional investigative information, identifies Roman Sterlingov as the principal operator of Bitcoin Fog,"" Beckett said.      Investigators also allegedly tied Sterlingov to the Bitcoin Fog domain, using a payment made through Liberty Reserve. The investigators also tied Sterlingov to Mt. Gox accounts, which the defendant apparently logged into from the same IP addresses that were used for the Liberty Reserve account.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/27/us-officials-arrest-alleged-operator-of-336m-bitcoin-mixing-service,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1d23e9e08fab7076084d842118953dd8600c5fdf-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386596,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBU6N9,1619557858,Polygon's Ethereum Scaling Project Is Never Complete: Sandeep Nailwal,"Crypto is a midwife for the next generation of finance: A simple set of tools built around a core idea of removing trusted intermediaries could form the foundation for a more secure, robust and innovative economy. Ethereum aims to be “the ultimate, fundamental settlement layer of this” new digital-first world, as Sandeep Nailwal, co-founder of ETH scaling solution Polygon, said.      Polygon, which was founded in India, itself was reborn this past year. Founded as the Matic Network in 2017, it was an early secondary layer to the Ethereum blockchain. It used an experimental solution called Plasma to shift transactions off the perennially clogged Ethereum base layer to a super-lightweight rail running parallel to it.    Polygon's Sandeep Nailwal will speak at Consensus 2021, May 24-27, on ETH 2.0, ETH ""Enhancers"" and Smart Money.    “We were among the top Plasma teams in 2018, then the industry hype moved somewhere else,” Nailwal said in an interview. “It keeps on moving.” The Polygon team is now focused on building something of a scaling-solution aggregator for Ethereum. Instead of focusing on just one scaling technique, Polygon wants to incorporate them all.      Ethereum has been a victim of its own success. It’s the most used decentralized application blockchain, with the largest developer community. It is frequently the source of some of crypto’s most innovative and popular trends. But the project can’t scale. In order to disrupt legacy finance, crypto developers have become obsessed with hacking Ethereum – with layer 2s, sidechains and, the most ambitious blockchain upgrade to date, Ethereum 2.0.      See also: Matic Network Now ‘Polygon’ as Platform Targets Ethereum’s L2 Woes      For a while, Plasma was the hot topic when discussing Ethereum’s chokepoints. It was the brainchild of Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum’s co-creator, and Joseph Poon, a co-founder of Bitcoin scaling startup Lightning Labs. They wrote a coolly worded white paper describing a framework with plenty of upside and “without significant limitations.”      Published during the 2017 supercycle – a period of hyperbolic growth during which Ethereum’s inability to scale couldn't be ignored – Plasma was soon billed as a way for Ethereum to match Visa’s transaction count (the yardstick for all blockchains, for some reason).      In practice, Plasma may have had more significant limitations than advertised or expected. Although Matic found early success – Nailwal said they counted about 150 live protocols or applications before deciding to rebrand as Polygon – people’s attention began to shift elsewhere.      Other scaling solutions hit the market (or were proposed), and talk of Ethereum 2.0, a complete overhaul to the Ethereum blockchain, began to pick up. Instead of resisting this changing landscape, Polygon has decided to embrace it.      This decision has paid off. Amid a booming market cycle, MATIC, the network's native token is soaring. It’s a small vindication today for a project that will never be complete.      Over a late-night (for him) Zoom call, Nailwal and I discussed why his team decided to expand the scope of Matic’s original vision, what that work entails and when, if ever, the project of reinventing finance will be finished.      See also: Buterin, Srinivasan Donate to COVID Relief Fund for India ‘Shaken’ by Second Wave      The following conversation has been lightly edited for clarity and brevity.      What was the drive to reinvent Polygon?      So, basically, with Matic Network we were doing one particular scaling approach, which was Plasma. We were onboarding hundreds of dapps, working with small DeFi (decentralized finance) builders, NFT (non-fungible token) application builders, games, enterprises – a large number of teams – when we realized there was no one solution-fits-all.      Secondly, we also definitely believe that Ethereum is going to be the ultimate, fundamental settlement layer of this Web3 internet. So instead of providing one type of scaling solution on top of Ethereum, we should provide a suite of scalability solutions for developers to choose what they really want.      If you take AWS (Amazon Web Services), they allow developers to choose between Linux, Windows, other kinds of servers. You’re free to choose. We wanted to do the same for decentralized, execution platforms.      We’re doing Optimistic Rollups, zk-rollups, data-availability chains, Polkadot-like substrates, standalone chains where teams can come and create their parachains that connect back to Ethereum.      Why are you choosing one blockchain to focus on, but multiple scaling solutions?      There are multiple aspects: First, Ethereum has network effects. We do a lot of hackathons, like 100 a year. 99.999% of all the developers we meet are breaking into blockchain development, and almost always, the first blockchain they work with is Ethereum. Once you come into Ethereum, the community, with its documentation, tooling, you kind of feel like a part of it.      All these newbies fall in love. These days, funding is available in plenty, so they’re most likely to stay to build products.      Second, the ethos of the Ethereum community. Think of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is the way it is because Satoshi built it that way, and at a very early stage anonymized himself. No normal leader would do that. Although Ethereum does have Vitalik and the Ethereum Foundation, who are still the biggest figures, the way they’ve been able to cultivate this fully decentralized community without dictating anything. As a person coming in, you feel as though you can propose any change to Ethereum, without taking orders from anyone. No one owns Ethereum.      Now with layer 2, scalability is coming. That makes it difficult for me to understand how any other blockchain will, first, be able to get the same network effects and, second, how they will be able to cultivate an ethos, which depends on the OGs. Many competing chains are VC-driven. Network effects and community are intangible things you cannot buy with money. You have to do the grind.      See also: Andrew Keys – 16 Ethereum Predictions From a Crypto Oracle      Then, Ethereum is not slowing down. If you compare 2020 to 2017, Ethereum has this DeFi wave. Previously, it had the ICO (initial coin offering) wave. Then you have NFT waves, there were DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) in between. These waves keep on coming, innovation keeps on coming. Do you see any particularly innovative product coming out of these other chains? I do not recall any project that was not already done on Ethereum.      How much of Matic are you keeping in Polygon?      Some people think that it’s a rebrand, that it’s a pivot. But actually, it’s an expansion. Matic stays the way it is. Think of it as a Venn diagram. Matic is a smaller circle within Polygon, while Polygon’s scope and vision has become much bigger. Polygon is now just launching. Matic has already launched.      When do you expect to go fully live?      Polygon, actually, technically will never be fully live. Because it is a layer 2 aggregator, and there will always be new solutions. There are multiple mainnets expected. You have this current Poly Plasma, and PoS, and data availability. Later this year you might have Optimistic rollups going live, Zk-Rollups going live. These solutions will keep on coming and getting consolidated in Polygon.      That’s a lot of specialized knowledge – does the Polygon team have to grow exponentially if the platform is, too?      That’s absolutely a valid question. The team has grown aggressively. The way we’ve built the Polygon ecosystem, we’ve never had a foundation or sold too many tokens. We’re holding tokens – maybe up to a billion dollars in treasury assets – and we intend to spend that money to grow this ecosystem. We already have people in Serbia, in Eastern Europe, building SDK (software development kits). We have a specialized team in India building data availability. Our previous team, the network team. We’re also collaborating with other specialized teams.      These will be multiple, decentralized teams all working for scaling Ethereum.      You’re building failure into the model. You’re willing to spend capital to build solutions that may not take off or fail, with the idea that it’s an ever growing, expanding universe.      That’s a nice articulation: We’re building failure into the model. The fundamental goal of Polygon is to not go all in on one particular approach. We learned that the hard way. We were among the top Plasma teams in 2018, then the industry hype moved somewhere else. It keeps on moving. We faced the brunt of that and decided we don’t want to be too specific. We want to be a multi-approach solution and provide these solutions to see which one picks up.      The vision is adoption. We see where that adoption is and go deep on that. Ultimately, it’s a community thing. If one type of solution is adopted, automatically, we’ll start to provide support.      Doesn’t Eth 2.0, an Ethereum that can scale on its own, reduce the need for Polygon?      Ethereum 2.0 is supposed to have 64 shards, each one is going to be similar to what Ethereum is today. Let’s say after you add proof-of-stake to the current, single Ethereum chain, it’s able to process 50 tps (transactions per second), up from 13 tps today. Multiply that 64 shards: 3,200 tps.    The assets never sleep, there’s no holidays    Do you think if Ethereum is going to become the fundamental settlement layer of the world that even 3,200 tps is a good enough scalability?      No, absolutely not. Let’s think of it as the supply of scalability. At the moment it goes up on Ethereum, the demand is already there. It will grow immediately and you will end up with the same bottlenecks.      That’s why Vitalik published a layer 2-centric roadmap for Ethereum, where he says ETH2.0 will only have data availability shards, meaning they will only have the data of the applications, but the execution happens on layer 2.      Ethereum 2.0 will become 64 times more scalable than Ethereum is now, but the demand is 1,000 X than where we are. You will need L2 scalability.      Polygon is often discussed alongside Polkadot and Cosmos. Are there plans for greater blockchain interoperability?      We are interoperable, but within Ethereum. A good mental model is to think of Polkadot as being in the center of a nest of parachains. With Polygon, the Ethereum chain is in the center with an array of Polygon chains around it. That’s why some people call it ‘Polkadot on Ethereum.’ It is interoperable between scaling solutions. Some people are building bridges to Binance Chain or Bitcoin, but at the foundation we are solely focused on Ethereum.      Every week there is a DeFi hack. Just recently EasyFi was hacked. Don’t these exploits harm adoption?      We should think about it as free markets. In free markets, eventually you have a way to create the alpha in the market that emerges out of it. You have these solutions like Compound, Aave and others that are extensively audited. They have not been hacked that much. Even in some larger protocols, like MakerDAO that have gotten hacked, it did not deplete it completely. It was a few million dollars, which is nothing compared to the size of the whole ecosystem. And then the community learns something, and that’s how it evolves. That’s the power of the network, of Ethereum.      See also: Did Ethereum Learn Anything From the $55M DAO Attack?      If you think there will be a future of programmable money, then that programmable money is going to be hacked. There is no way that it wouldn’t be. There were big hacks in Web 2.0, and there will be in Web 3.0 also. But that’s how the industry evolves. They are not bad things.      I was looking at your calendar, and it looks like you have calls after this. Do you ever get to sleep?      Yeah, yeah, yeah. I have one more call after this, then, after that, some internal calls. Generally, I end up doing 16-17 calls a day, so about 12 hours only on calls. Then I rest five-six hours and work to have things to discuss on those calls. My life is always spending. Personal life gets affected a lot. And this is not only for me.      Everybody who is doing anything significant in crypto is going through the same situation. I think it’s the nature of the industry. The assets never sleep, there’s no holidays, no Christmas, no year-end holidays. People have said before there will be studies on mental health on the people in crypto. People in this industry are mentally... I myself have had medical issues. I have had to be on constant medication, but then I can’t take a break, so I have to keep going with medication.      This is such a huge topic, and I think it’s only gotten worse during the pandemic.      When you are building your own token startup, basically you are a public company, you have similar obligations as being a public company because everything is on view. Plus, you have to handle all of the pressure of being a startup. You have to build your product, find your customers and all that. The pressure is multifold. You are working in the finance industry and you are working in a startup – both are extremely excruciating things, but together in one job. It has been very taxing. On a personal level, professional level I feel like I have aged a lot.      I’ll be 34 this July. Kids call me ‘uncle’ already.      It seems like the Indian ecosystem is poised to explode, but it’s also being hampered by regulatory uncertainty. Could you give a little insight into the legal situation?      The legal situation has been overly sensationalized by the media. And that was the object of the Indian government: to keep a shadow of uncertainty over crypto in India, so retail does not get into it. They also tried to bring a shadow ban via RBI, the Bank of India. But that was not a ban by law. And also, obviously, India is a leading country – not as strong as in the U.S. – in terms of material liberty. People challenged the ban in court, the court overturned it and all that. The moment that happened the whole industry exploded and India is back to being one of the top regions for crypto.      What’s the appeal of working in crypto in India?      Developers have really found a gold mine here. Elite developers are getting into it, because they get paid in dollars. If they take USD, their salaries go up relative to those getting paid in rupees. It’s very lucrative. It’s difficult to find comparative salaries here. The salaries will likely continue to rise over the next three to four years, approaching what you have in Silicon Valley.      See also: How Normies Are Getting Crypto-Rich With DeFi      I think the salaries for good developers across the world will start approaching some global standard. Right now, a $60,000 salary in India would get you a senior developer. In SF (San Francisco), that would get you a college student. So the scene is poised to explode.      And that’s part of the reason the government is unlikely to ban it outright. It’s an important front for the country. They are definitely going to regulate it, though.",NEUTRAL,ETH | MATIC,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | MATIC | TOKEN SALE,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/27/polygons-ethereum-scaling-project-is-never-complete-sandeep-nailwal,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/158923b54401730b30c7bcb1a54371288a47e10b-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386598,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBU6Pf,1619556218,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Over $55K as Ether Hits New All-Time High,"Bitcoin was up Tuesday despite lower-than-average spot volumes. Meanwhile, ether’s price hits record high and the cyrpto's dominance is back at February levels.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $54,840 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 1.4% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $52,722-$55,261 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC near the 10-hour and well above the 50-hour moving average on the hourly chart, a bullish signal for market technicians.    The price of bitcoin climbed as high as $55,261 around 17:00 GMT (12 PM ET) before settling to $54,840 as of press time.      It’s possible the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization could be headed higher.      “A test of the $56,000 mark will soon follow, then will most likely roll back,” said Constantine Kogan, a partner at investment firm Wave Financial.      According to CoinDesk 20 data, bitcoin was last at $56,000 on April 20, when it declined from the all-time high price of $64,829 reached April 14.      The rise this week comes after bitcoin's price went as low as $47,272 on Sunday.      Stefan Coolican, chief financial officer for investment firm Ether Capital, says dumps and recoveries are just part of the crypto market. “I think the weekend sell-off was overdone, personally, so a bounce back makes sense,” Coolican said.      Spot bitcoin exchange volumes for Tuesday were around $2.6 billion as of press time, compared with the past three months’ average of $5.1 billion of BTC changing hands daily.      It’s possible larger players are the ones in the market this week, with retail and new investors remaining cautious because of crypto’s notorious gyration. This caused lower volumes Tuesday.      “Bitcoin is an information-asymmetry environment,” Wave’s Kogan said. “A small number in the community are aware of impending price changes, and only a small number of global venues are able to manage these large trades.”      Despite the volume doldrums, a positive news cycle is affecting bitcoin’s price, Kogan said.      “JPMorgan is preparing to launch an actively managed bitcoin fund for high-net-worth clients,” Kogan said. “Tesla announced the sale of part of [its] bitcoins and profit taking, which is also positive. This helps the bullish trend. ”      Read More: Bitcoin Options Market Eyes $4.2B in Expiries on Friday    Ether price hits fresh new high    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH), was up Tuesday, trading around $2,631 and climbing 5.2% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Ether rose Tuesday to a record high price near $2,700 after a powerful three-day rally.      The price of ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, climbed as high as $2,683.30 around 16:00 UTC (12 p.m. ET), based on CoinDesk data.      The new high came after three straight daily gains totaling 19%. The move extended the cryptocurrency’s stunning rally this year. Ether's price has tripled thus far in 2021, in part thanks to trader enthusiasm over growth in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens, both of which use the Ethereum blockchain. Bitcoin (BTC), by comparison, is up 89% this year.      “Ether has picked up its head and looks poised for a few more days of outperformance,” said Katie Stockton, a technical analyst for the consulting firm Fairlead Strategies.      Technical progress on Ethereum may be enticing investors to buy, said Ether Capital’s Coolican.      “It’s just more people understanding the value [proposition] of Ethereum and the token accrual model with proof-of-stake and EIP 1559,” Coolican told CoinDesk. Proof-of-stake is the more efficient form of consensus for cryptocurrency networks to which Ethereum is upgrading, and EIP 1559 is a development proposal expected to reduce fees on the network.

Wave Financial’s Kogan says interest in DOGE waxes and wanes at its own rhythm. “They are good in memes creation, I give them that. But I'm very skeptical about this Doge mania,” he told CoinDesk. “It may end up badly, with retail investors losing a lot of money. Or, better to say, when it will happen.”      Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are all green Tuesday.

Fantom is designed to act as a bypass around that congestion, allowing for faster, cheaper transactions. Fantom literature says the blockchain has 1-second transaction speeds and near-zero fees.

It is a reminder of how the fast-growing technologies' appeal extends to investors in traditional markets.      The Wall Street firm identified 19 stocks with a market capitalization of at least $1 billion and high exposure to blockchain technology or cryptocurrencies.      On average, the stocks have climbed 46% year to date, versus 12% for the S&P 500, according to the Goldman report dated April 26. Notably, the average lagged behind a direct bet on bitcoin (BTC), which gained 89% over the period.      Marathon Digital Holdings (NASDAQ: MARA), Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ: RIOT), and Microstrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR) were included in Goldman’s blockchain exposed stock list. Also included were traditional financial companies like JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) and Visa (NYSE: V).

42386592,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBU6Kd,1619548662,"Yearn Finance Earns $5M in Q1, Besting Total 2020 Profit","Yearn Finance, the robo adviser for yield of decentralized finance (DeFi), made almost $5 million in the first quarter, 30% more than it earned for all of 2020.      The project’s second quarterly report since its inception in mid-2020 showed profits were heavily skewed toward the end of the period.      Yearn has become one of the leading places for DeFi users seeking passive yields to entrust their funds. It rocketed to center stage in 2020 when it released its governance token, YFI, the first so-called fair launch.      The project is effectively a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), functioning without the same sort of rules or expectations as traditional businesses. However, this report seems to indicate that Yearn's staff is interested in following at least some of the practices that have proven to be useful in the analog financial world.      Total value locked (TVL) in the Yearn ecosystem broke $2 billion in the first quarter, according to the report.      The report also provides a TVL estimate beyond the first quarter: ""As of April 15th, 2021, Yearn has over $3B in TVL without any token subsidies or other incentives typically offered by competing protocols in DeFi.""    The details    Yearn's quarterly report for Q1 2021 is not audited and meant only as informational for those in the Yearn community. This is the second such financial report from Yearn following its August to October report last year.      It has also created a dashboard for interested members of the community to continuously monitor its financials.      The project netted $4.8 million in EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), which is $1.1 million more than it earned in all of 2020. Most of it was earned in March, the last month recorded.      Yearn also earned almost $500,000 per month yield farming with its own treasury, an activity it began in February. ""We expect yield farming to contribute to an increasing amount of top-line revenue moving forward,"" the report said.      Revenue was primarily driven by yVaults, the smart contracts where users can deposit funds and allow Yearn's strategists to find yield opportunities. Thirty-six new yVaults opened in the first part of the year.      The report notes an ongoing and synergistic relationship with Curve Finance, the automated market maker for stablecoins. Yearn is a major participant in governance on Curve through its vault of permanently locked Curve governance tokens, CRV.      The Yearn report lists 17 members of staff, whose salaries are paid in Ethereum ERC-20 tokens. Its salary expenses in the first quarter would work out to just under $1 million annually. It also spent $150,000 in grants through the first quarter. Yearn's grants fund smaller projects, such as design work, community outreach, etc.      Yearn went through a controversial expansion of supply in its governance token YFI this year, driven primarily by a need to retain its most talented strategists. The organization minted 6,666 YFI, with a third of that set aside for existing contributors, contingent on their continued involvement.      The report acknowledges that what it calls its ""ecosystem"" has expanded, with entities like Pickle and C.R.E.A.M. joining, without providing further clarity on the relationships other than to say that the YFI token (Yearn Finance's governance token) does not govern those projects.",POSITIVE,YFI,BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION | YFI,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/27/yearn-finance-earns-5m-in-q1-besting-total-2020-profit,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/79adc9857b60e949740555642595bad8f3153b2a-1541x1027.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

That Cuban was discussing dogecoin on ""Ellen,"" a daily talk show with an average of 1.5 million viewers, many of whom are women below the age of 54, could bring the Shiba Inu-themed crypto into the mainstream.      “Cryptocurrency is just an asset to invest in. Bitcoin is kind of like a digital version of gold. Ethereum is a digital version of a currency,” Cuban told DeGeneres. “And then you got dogecoin, which is just fun. But the weird part about it [is] it went from being a cryptocurrency joke to now becoming something that’s becoming a digital currency.”    All in the family    Cuban explained that his 11-year-old son, Jake, is involved in dogecoin, with the two Cubans buying “$30 worth.”      “So the question everyone wants to know, is dogecoin a good investment? And here’s the reason I got Jake into it. It’s not necessarily the best investment you can make, but you can buy it on Robinhood, and signing up and trading on Robinhood is free. So that’s one thing,” Cuban said.      “The second thing is it’s about 26 cents per dogecoin. So if you go and spend five, 10, 15 dollars, that’s a better investment than buying a lottery ticket. And you know what? It could go up,” he continued. “It’s also becoming a digital currency, which is crazy if you think back to its origins.”    Read more: Mark Cuban on Bitcoin, NFTs and What Comes Next: ‘The Upside Is Truly Unlimited’    Cuban noted his Mavericks basketball team's store accepts dogecoin for merchandise, and suggested DeGeneres do the same for her Ellen Shop. (He did not mention that spending even trivial amounts of crypto on goods and services can incur a tax liability in the U.S.)      “But, overall, when someone brings up dogecoin to you and asks you if it’s a good investment, I wouldn’t say it’s the world’s best investment, but it’s a whole lot better than a lottery ticket and it’s a great way to learn and start understanding cryptocurrencies,” Cuban said.      “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” had an average of 1.5 million viewers over the past six months, down from 2.6 million viewers for the same period in 2020, according to a recent report in the New York Times quoting data from research firm Nielsen.      The core audience for “Ellen” is adult women below the age of 54, according to Nielsen. In September, DeGeneres publicly apologized on the show for allegations of workplace misconduct.    KYC TV    Cuban did not mention risk factors such as dogecoin's unlimited supply and sparse technical development.      He did, however, explain one of the realities of trading crypto on regulated platforms: they collect sensitive personal information from users.      After DeGeneres said she felt uncomfortable because Robinhood asks for a Social Security number, Cuban gave the audience a primer in anti-money-laundering requirements.      ""There's something called know-your-customer,"" he said. ""They have to make sure you're not a money launderer or a fraudster, and so they have to confirm your identity.""      As if to reassure viewers, he said Robinhood is ""pretty good at keeping [data] secure. ... I didn't have a problem putting in my information.""      DeGeneres replied: ""well, I trust you.""

42386586,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBU683,1619544188,DeFi Will Decentralize the Enterprise,"What is enterprise DeFi? It depends on who you ask.      If you ask Paul Brody, at EY, it’s about enterprises using DeFi (decentralized finance).      If you ask Cordite’s Richard Crook, it’s about corporations operating a slightly less centralized network using “DLT” (distributed ledger technology) in a consortium environment.      If you ask me, it’s about creating new, decentralized web-scale enterprise structures and effective internet-based coordination mechanisms among known or unknown legal and natural persons. In other words, governance is everything.      Paul's and Richard’s perspectives are entirely valid and certainly part of the picture. From my perspective, enterprise DeFi must decentralize the enterprise, not centralize DeFi software in the hands of legacy corporate structures.    The operative word is decentralized, not finance    Thanks to the army of mathematics and physics PhDs whom Wall Street hired between 1970 to 2008, it is incredibly difficult to invent new finance. With the rare exception of, say, flash loans, any competent quant can map financial innovations in DeFi 1:1 to a previous financial innovation on Wall Street.    Ajit Tripathi, a CoinDesk columnist, is the head of Institutional Business at Aave. Previously, he served as a fintech partner at ConsenSys and was a co-founder of PwC’s U.K. Blockchain Practice.    That means the real innovation in DeFi is decentralization, and even that has roots and parallels in the history of money and commerce. Decision-making by token-holder voting is not entirely different from proxy voting, and traders guilds in ancient India and medieval Italy ran mutualized lending, trading, insurance, money and asset management services using similar decision-making systems.      Public blockchain technology enables decentralization to work at internet-scale among pseudonymous participants who don’t need to trust or even know each other, and that’s a pretty big deal. Ergo, if becoming enterprise means losing this core aspect of decentralization at web-scale, then it’s just CeFi (centralized finance) or legacy-Fi on the blockchain, not DeFi.      So what exactly is decentralization? I have written about the topic over the years. The key question to ask in assessing if something is decentralized is the governance question, i.e. who has control over decision-making and to what extent? That has two dimensions – technical decentralization and economic decentralization.    Technical decentralization    Technical decentralization means that anyone can use or contribute to the software or technical infrastructure created for the decentralized product or service. In DeFi, the deployment, enhancement and operation of the software is not controlled by any one legal or natural person. The open-source nature and public blockchain deployment of DeFi is therefore non-negotiable.      Using a public permissionless blockchain helps because it exposes the functionality to everyone who cares to examine or reuse it, but it’s not sufficient. If a crypto exchange builds and runs smart contract-based applications on a public permissionless blockchain, but 95% of the commits to the blockchain come from employees or contractors of the exchange, the blockchain is not very decentralized.    Read more: Michael Casey: Enterprise Blockchain Isn’t Dead    Also, if the exchange can reorganize the blockchain at will, then such DeFi applications are certainly not decentralized. In fact, Linux and MySQL are more decentralized than such dapps. Similarly, if the founding team of a DeFi protocol controls the admin key that can be used to make arbitrary code changes, then such a protocol is not very decentralized.      As it turns out, not all open-source software is the same, and some open-source software ships with licensing that gives special rights or even control to the creators of the software. The fewer such rights and restrictions embedded in DeFi software, the more decentralized such software is. In essence, I believe no license is more decentralized than GNU licensing, which in turn is more decentralized than MIT licensing, which again is more decentralized than Apache licensing. The legal rights and restrictions embedded in the software licensing are much more important.      Taking technical decentralization to enterprise requires some compromise because enterprise needs to be commercially incentivized to use the software and because enterprise entities often assume liability for non-performance of the software or the service. That is why Geth (which allows anyone to run an Ethereum node) ships under GNU licensing and Hyperledger Besu ships under Apache 2.0 licensing.    Economic decentralization    Economic decentralization has two core aspects: control and liability. The less concentrated each of these is, the more decentralized the protocol.      Enterprise structures, whether sole trader businesses, partnerships or corporations, are defined by who makes the decisions that govern the operation of the service offered and who has the liability for nonperformance. A limited liability corporation, which is the most popular enterprise structure, assigns limited liabilities to principals, i.e. owners/shareholders.      The liabilities for nonperformance often sit with agents, i.e. managers whom shareholders hire to make decisions on their behalf. When the agents’ incentives are not aligned with the principals', it leads to principal-agent conflict. A classic example: When Wall Street execs make decisions to maximize their bonuses, rather than long-term shareholder value.      Indeed, there are even aspects of decentralization within centralized corporations. The level of economic decentralization depends on the level of concentration in stakeholder voting. Before the existence of blockchain technology, internet-scale coordination of stakeholder votes was practically nonviable. Shareholders had to elect a board of directors to represent them. In such a structure, if the CEO of a corporation can push any decision through on a whim without any pushback from a board looking out for long-term value, such a corporation is more centralized.    Read more: Ajit Tripathi: NFTs Can Bring the Real World On-Chain    Similarly, there are elements of centralization even within DeFi protocols, and as Securities and Exchange Commission commissioner Hester Peirce’s safe harbor proposal recognizes, nearly everything starts centralized. Bitcoin, the first ever DeFi protocol, started with one guy writing a white paper on an obscure internet channel and then a few developers, like Gavin Andresen, writing the bulk of the code.      Over the next few years, bitcoin (BTC) became widely distributed, and the number of contributors to bitcoin core grew from three people to a few hundred people. The fact that bitcoin was practically worthless but practically brilliant in the early days meant people weren’t hoarding as many bitcoins as they could or running giant mining pools next to hydropower dams. In fact, one could even argue that after the initial years of rapid decentralization, bitcoin has become more economically and technically centralized as its value has gone up hundreds of times.      In the case of a DeFi protocol, the exam question is how much more decentralized it is than when it started and what’s the rate of increase in decentralization? Are tokens becoming less concentrated in the hands of whales? Is the team using treasury to force decisions? Is the team controlling an admin key to force decisions through? Are a few large whales making decisions? Does a participant need to buy tokens on an exchange before they can vote, or if they have a good idea that benefits the community, can they just ask the community to delegate votes to them?    So what is enterprise DeFi?    DeFi and enterprise have a lot to learn from each other. The most important thing enterprises can learn from DeFi is how to use public permissionless blockchain technology to become more technically and economically decentralized to enable much greater fairness and inclusion in economic activity. For example, corporations can employ public blockchain technology for shareholder voting and limit the role of the board of directors to guardians rather than often conflicted intermediaries. Corporations can further enable shareholders to delegate votes to other stakeholders in the society and thus alleviate the externalities and ill effects of shareholder capitalism.

Specifically in enterprise blockchain, a lot of work has been done on security, data privacy and software engineering practices. In DeFi, there’s an infinite library of robust, battle-tested smart contracts built by highly motivated and talented engineers that enterprises can simply adapt or use. DeFi protocols can also benefit from robust software development, testing and deployment practices established in enterprise software.      And yes, of course, enterprises can simply plug into DeFi and benefit from the growing asset liquidity, the return generation opportunities and the entire category of peer-to-peer and peer-to-protocol web 3 commerce that is coming online with non-fungible tokens.      Most of all, forward-thinking enterprises can facilitate the legal innovation that’s required to provide a firm legal foundation for decentralized protocols. A recent and extremely pertinent example is the Wyoming DAO (decentralized autonomous organizations) Law. As DeFi goes to enterprise, we will use more of such legal innovation to decentralize the enterprise rather than building centralized, hierarchical, rent-seeking entities on decentralized technology.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Ajit Tripathi,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/27/defi-will-decentralize-the-enterprise,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8150c4d54007764c45834b415e60a1d2e75dfafa-1400x933.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386590,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBU6Gr,1619543033,"The Node: Bitcoin Is Real, Fictional Money","These days it’s become common for people to ask, what is money? It’s a fair question. There’ve been more than a few events this past year that have complicated, if not outright challenged, the usual, everyday, whip-out-your-credit-card-and-pay mentality when it comes to spending. The U.S. monetary supply has expanded by 30%, for instance. Can money just expand like that? Then there are all these acronyms for new financial tools: NFTs, SPACs, DOGE. At the very least, these things cost a lot of money.      The usual line economists take is that money serves three functions in an economy. It’s a medium of exchange, store of value and unit of account. It’s a simple checklist to determine if some asset has the right attributes and can rightfully be called money. In 2014, NYU professor David Yermack called bitcoin a “marginally useful,” money-like commodity popular among hackers and “opponents of the banking system.” Just yesterday, a fifth National Football League star announced he’d take at least a portion of his compensation in BTC.    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    Bitcoin has escaped from its nerdy, anarcho-capitalist roots and entered the financial mainstream. It’s accepted as payment at Tesla and WeWork. Institutional giants are buying and holding bitcoins. At least some things – usually other cryptos – are natively priced in bitcoin. So is bitcoin money? Here are three views:    1. Money itself is a collective fiction, and so is bitcoin    Money is and has always been, as CoinDesk Chief Content Office Michael Casey says, a collective imagination. There’s no intrinsic aspect that makes money, money. Instead, it is whatever object on which we can all agree has steady, transactional value. Yap stones, gold and fiat. Bitcoin is the latest chapter in this shared imagining, a new, digital good that bypasses the sovereign issuer and presents the world with a freely accessible standard.      Bitcoin, under this framework, is money when it crosses some undefined, ineffable standard of adoption, such as when there are finally enough people that say, “sure, pay me in bitcoin.” No one knows where the line is, but this weekend’s New York Times ran a story with the headline, “We’re All Crypto People Now.” So it’s possible we’ve crossed it.    2. Bitcoin is not money, it’s an investable asset    In 2018, at the tail end of that year’s supercycle, the St. Louis Federal Reserve raised the question, is bitcoin money or a financial instrument? “The line between money and financial asset [sic] is not clear,” the economists wrote. “People's actions often reveal the role the asset is playing in the economy.”      Although introduced to the world as digital, peer-to-peer cash, bitcoin had not yet taken up that role, the Fed economists said. Instead, it was a “highly speculative asset.” A potential bubble. An inadequate currency due to its price fluctuation and limited liquidity, that few were actually using “to buy goods and services.”    Read more: Michael Casey: Dogecoin and the New Meaning of Money    Three years on, there are still more than a few people who take this view. The journalist Brett Scott argued that bitcoin has been successfully branded as a deflationary good by financially conservative fearmongers. Although bitcoin may be used to purchase goods, that wouldn’t be proof a cash-equivalent transaction had taken place. Instead, it would be a countertrade between two assets. Just think about where you’re likely to come into possession of BTC: by buying from a crypto exchange.      That said, bitcoin is different from other commodities. It was designed to be fungible, to be broken down into small units of account and to be easily transferable and stored. Perhaps that’s what Scott means by “ornate digital collectible.” But few other digital goods have all those cash-like qualities.      The Federal Reserve hasn’t released an accounting of the current crypto supercycle, yet, so it’s difficult to say whether the central bank's thinking on bitcoin has changed. But it has published a DeFi explainer.    3. Bitcoin is...    It’s possible bitcoin is all of these things and more. It functions like cash. It also functions like a speculative asset. People are buying it as an inflation hedge as well as for its volatility. It’s a burgeoning global reserve currency and a distributed ledger on which to run decentralized applications.      The question whether bitcoin is real money is reductive. This is especially the case when you consider its metaphysical properties. Bitcoins don’t exist in the world, but to what extent do they exist at all?      Northern Illinois University assistant professor Craig Warmke pushes back against the idea that bitcoin exists as a chunk of code. It isn't real. Instead, he argues, Bitcoin is “a fictional substance in a massively coauthored story on a network.”      In other words: “Bitcoin just is.”      UPDATE: 4/28 (16:18 UTC): Corrects Craig Warmke's title, he is an assistant professor not an associate professor.",NEUTRAL,BTC | DOGE,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | DOGE | EXCHANGE | FIAT,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/27/the-node-bitcoin-is-real-fictional-money,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5228b9c1767e4a076f216d6574ece8c7b4ad6089-2224x1162.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin’s hashrate – an estimate of how much computational power miners produce at a given time – has recovered from roughly 125 exahashes per second following the outages to nearly 160 exahashes per second, according to mining pool API data.    Read more: How Accidents in Chinese Coal Mines Are Affecting Bitcoin Mining    Miners in the coal-abundant Xinjiang province began bringing their machines online at the end of last week, while more came online over the weekend though at a slower rate than expected, F2Pool Director of Global Finance and Business Development Liang Da told CoinDesk.      ""The total hashrate is around 150 exahashes a second right now. The recovery is slower than expected,"" he said, adding that the network needs another 20 exahashes or so to come online before it is at pre-outage levels.    Read more: Bitcoin Transactions Are More Expensive Than Ever    Compass Mining CEO Thomas Heller told CoinDesk the network's current hashrate could be higher than the nearly 160 exahashes reported by mining pool APIs when factoring in miners who keep their data private like Foundry.    Bitcoin mining cycles in China    The affected miners rely on cheap coal during China’s dry season to power their machines. Once the rains pick up at the end of May, most will migrate to Northern China to make use of this region’s cheap hydroelectric power.      Igor Runets, the CEO of bitcoin mining colocation firm BitRiver, told CoinDesk that the outages, though temporary, underscore Chinese mining centralization as well as the need to move toward renewables.      “Although the drop in hashrate was temporary, it was yet another sign of both the unreliability of non-renewable sources of energy for bitcoin mining and the centralization of mining in China. I believe that bitcoin mining’s future is green, and places with surplus renewable energy have the most potential for it,” he said.      In light of the current bull market, bitcoin’s energy footprint has yet again come under scrutiny, with some newcomers intent on buying “clean” bitcoin that only comes from renewables mining.

42386578,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBU2jx,1619538198,Inflation Worry Spreads Beyond Bitcoiners to Wall Street Stock Analysts,"The inflation scare looks to be spreading to stock markets from the bond and bitcoin markets. Suddenly, it’s a top-of-the-mind concern for Wall Street analysts peppering CEOs with questions during quarterly earnings conference calls.      According to a new report from Bank of America, the second-biggest U.S. bank, the number of mentions of ""inflation"" in earnings calls of Standard & Poor’s 500 companies has more than tripled year on year, the most significant jump in 17 years. The bank published the note Monday, according to MarketWatch.      Strategists cited raw materials, transportation and labor as major potential drivers of inflation, adding that the number of mentions of inflation has historically led the consumer price index (CPI) by a quarter, with a 52% correlation. As per Bloomberg, several companies have begun passing on higher costs to consumers.      Bond markets have been predicting a pickup in inflation for at least a year. Inflation expectations for the second half of the coming decade have more than doubled since the March 2020 crash to a 30-month high of 2.25%, per data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.      Bitcoin has risen roughly in tandem with inflation expectations over the past 13 months – since just after the March crash – and recently hit record highs above $64,000. Though the price has since settled back to about $55,200, the cryptocurrency is still up about 90% this year alone.      Several publicly listed companies such as Tesla and MicroStrategy have already adopted bitcoin as an asset within their corporate treasuries, casting the cryptocurrency as a store of value, like a digital version of gold.      ""What we’re trying to do is preserve our treasury; the purchasing power of the cash is debasing rapidly,"" MicroStrategy's CEO Michael Saylor told CoinDesk in November. ""Bitcoin is a million times better than antiquated gold.""      MicroStrategy has announced purchases of 91,326 BTC worth $5.02 billion.      The U.S. electric car maker Tesla sold 10% of its bitcoin holdings in the first quarter for $272 million in proceeds, having snapped up coins worth $1.5 billion in January.      “We’ve been quite pleased with how much liquidity there is in the bitcoin market,” Tesla CFO Zach Kirkhorn told analysts Monday on a conference call, according to a transcript. “Our ability to build our first position happened very quickly. When we did the sale later in March, we also were able to execute on that very quickly.”      There’s ample speculation whether other corporations might follow suit, with inflation expectations rising on Main Street and bitcoin outshining traditional assets over the past 13 months.      The yellow metal, a traditional inflation hedge, has risen by a paltry 22% in the past 13 months, and Bloomberg's commodity index has jumped by 50%.

42386577,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBU2lD,1619537317,The Art of the Prank: How a Hacker Tried to Fake the World's Most Expensive NFT,"A pseudonymous hacker by the name of “Monsieur Personne” is making fake copies of the most expensive non-fungible token (NFT) in the world.      The intent, according to a blog post the hacker wrote on April 4, is to “show you just how ludicrous the situation with the NFT hype is.”      The pseudonymous individual has created a counterfeit NFT of Beeple’s “Everydays: The First 5000 Days,” which famously sold in a Christie’s auction for $69 million on March 11.      Personne is trying to prove that despite all the media frenzy about NFTs, they’re not as unique or secure as people think.      After attempting to contact those with a large reach, such as media companies or security firms, to tell anyone who would listen, the hacker decided to take matters into his own hands.      ""I started this whole project by sharing the details in closed circles. I was met with disbelief, criticism and ridicule,"" Personne told CoinDesk via Twitter DM. ""Way too much gatekeeping in the crypto sphere. That’s when I realized that I need to prove the concept in order to be taken seriously.""      To be clear, this isn’t a matter of the content of an NFT being duplicated. Anyone can download an exact replica image of Beeple’s art work by googling the title of the piece, much like anyone can photocopy a poster. It’s not difficult to see or own a copy of a digital image, especially one that has already been shared widely on the internet.      What is comparatively more difficult to do is fool people into thinking you own the original art creation and provide cryptographic proof – namely, in the form of an NFT, first minted by the artist. This is because an NFT is supposed to be unique. By nature of it being stored on a blockchain, its entire transaction history is also supposed to be permanently preserved.      ""The blockchain is my public ledger/proof, and my website is the record of the facts. I honestly love the concept of NFTs and seriously believe that they are the future of assets, just like crypto is the future of finance,"" said Personne.    Read more: What Are NFTs and How Do They Work?    What Personne has done is create his own unique NFT on the Ethereum blockchain, the same public ledger on which the original Beeple NFT is stored. He engineered components of his NFT creation such as its token ID and transaction history to resemble components of the original one minted by Beeple. To be clear, Personne does not own the original NFT, but to the casual observer it might appear that he does.      Also, importantly, the duplicate NFTs created by Personne do not put the authenticity of the original masterpiece at risk.      The challenge to users is to try to tell which is an authentic Beeple art piece and which isn’t. Here’s how we deduced the difference.    What makes an NFT unique    First, we tracked down all the identifiers that make the Beeple NFT unique.      Beeple’s artwork has a token ID that no one person can replicate from the same smart contract. Here is the verified smart contract address that Beeple used to create his “Everydays: The First 5000 Days” NFT:      When Beeple minted the infamous NFT, it was given token ID #40913. Following the movement of this token is a matter of following this identifier from account to account on the Ethereum blockchain.      First you can see it minted into the verified account of Beeple himself. Then it is transferred to an unidentified account, shortly before settling into the account of MetaKovan, the known buyer of Beeple’s $69 million artwork.    Trick #1: Create an unverified smart contract    In his attempts to fool users, Personne has issued his own Beeple NFT with the exact same token ID: #40913. How is this possible? The key here is that Personne’s NFT was minted by a different smart contract.      ""I wrote my own smart contract that follows the ERC-721 specification,"" said Personne. ""What I did is add a bit of additional logic into the contract. This allowed me to create my own functions and steps that are not interfering with the standard but provide me with the abilities to execute actions in a way that I want them to.""      In other words, it was minted by a different Ethereum-based application that Personne created and coded. This means he has complete control over the token IDs this application spews out and the kind of NFTs it mints.    Read more: ‘A Crazy Success Story’: Trevor Jones’ NFT Gamble Pays Off    Users can check and review the smart contract issuing an NFT on any public Ethereum blockchain explorer. Even though an NFT might boast the same token ID as another, this doesn’t mean it's the same asset. It’s important to make sure the same smart contract used to mint a particular collectible token is also the same contract being called upon to trade the token.      Most reliable ones will be labeled as open-sourced and verified code on block explorers. Others, like the one Personne has created, will be illegible without a manual translation of its code.      All of this work to double-check the authenticity of an NFT does require knowledge of how to use a tool such as Etherscan as well as a basic ability to navigate through these sites. Luckily, there are helpful online guides for first-time users, but the lesson for potential buyers should be to verify what they are looking at prior to making a purchase.    Trick #2: Use a verified artist’s account to sell your NFT    Personne did go one step further in trying to obfuscate the inauthenticity of his NFT creations. He made it appear on public blockchain explorers such as Etherscan and third-party websites such as Rarible that the NFTs he had minted were created by Beeple himself.      Nifty News reported on April 19 that Personne was able to do this by building his smart contract with a “seizure” feature. The feature automatically drops the fake NFT into the verified account of Beeple and immediately transfers it back out again. In other words, it makes it appear that for a brief moment the NFT was held by Beeple and sold by Beeple.      According to Fabiano Soriani, the former lead blockchain engineer for Dapper Labs who also helped create the ERC-721 standard for NFTs on Ethereum, this is not a new functionality but a known smart-contract exploit that other hackers have used in the past.    Read more: NFT Investments Raises $48M via London Stock Exchange Growth Market Listing    “On Ethereum, any contract can emit any event, so a contract may claim to be an ERC-721 and emit events that can express essentially anything,” said Soriani in an email. “Just the same way anyone could write a tweet online, or post in a message board stating incorrect information.”      Rarible did not respond to multiple requests for comment, but took blocked access to the duplicate NFT on Tuesday. Beeple did not return a request for comment.    Action is required    There are hints, however, to suggest that even when an NFT appears to have been created by a famous artist, it’s actually a fake. The most telling one is the information around the asset for sale.      On NFT marketplace Rarible, the verified account of Beeple appears to have made a second copy of his original “Everydays: The First 5000 Days” piece as part of the “NFTheft” collection. This is, of course, false. Monsieur Personne is the one who generated this copy, not Beeple, for the sake of sending the message that users shouldn’t trust everything they read on the internet.      Clicking on the name of the collection, Rarible redirects users to a page with a single smart-contract address, which belongs to Personne’s own unverified NFT application.      While Personne’s trickery doesn’t appear to have spread far – the highest bid for his fake Beeple NFT on Rarible was $232.54 – his actions highlight important characteristics about how NFTs work and from where their authenticity comes.      “Bad [smart] contracts emitting incorrect events is only one more characteristic of the blockchain that has to be known,” Soriani said.      Speaking to the need for better infrastructure in NFT marketplaces to identify these behaviors and weed out illegitimate assets from their platform, he added:      “I do expect marketplaces to quickly wise up to the fact that this kind of activity can happen and be more careful to only legitimize authentic sources.”      Personne agrees: ""The ironic thing is that this would never be possible if strict regulations and policies were enforced and practiced by all the corporations minting NFTs these days.""

Bitmain released a video for the new Antminer E9, which it claims will do the work of 32 graphics cards (GPUs), the expensive processors typically coveted by PC gamers that are also used by miners to mine for ether and other coins. The advertisement says the machines can produce up to 3 gigahashes per second (the best GPUs produce roughly 100 megahashes per second).    Read more: Valid Points: Yes, Front-Running Will Still Exist on Ethereum 2.0    Ethereum, like other so-called ASIC-resistant blockchains that use a different hashing algorithm than Bitcoin’s SHA-256, are supposed to reject hashes from ASICs, which are designed to produce hashes for mining purposes only, and serve no other computing function (like graphics for gaming. for example). Still, as evidenced by the E9 and other crypto ASICs, manufacturers have found ways around these limitations.      Bitmain’s product release follows GPU maker Nvidia’s rollout of mining-specific graphics cards, a response to card shortages as the crypto market’s mining boom has squeezed supply chains and driven up costs for gamers.      As miners purchase these products, it underscores a tension between an Ethereum mining industry that is heavily invested in proof-of-work while its community and developers make moves toward a new network in Ethereum 2.0 and proof-of-stake.

42386575,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBU2ih,1619530200,State of Crypto: Congress Takes One Step Closer to Regulatory Clarity,"The House passed a bill geared toward ultimately clarifying digital asset regulation in the U.S. If it becomes law, the industry might finally have the regulatory clarity it has been seeking.    You're reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  One step closer  The narrative    The U.S. House of Representatives passed H.R. 1602, the “Eliminate Barriers to Innovation Act of 2021,” last week, sending it to the Senate, which referred it to the Senate Banking Committee. If passed and signed into law, the bipartisan bill would commission a working group to evaluate how the U.S. currently treats digital assets.    Why it matters    This might be the first major crypto bill to get anywhere in Congress. What’s more, it’s one that, if passed, would have a direct impact on how the U.S. treats digital assets. This could finally provide companies in this industry with some much-requested regulatory clarity. The fact the bill has support from both parties is another mark in its favor. Of course, if regulatory agencies don't act until this bill is implemented, it'll be quite some time before any actual clarity is adopted.    Breaking it down    The entire House of Representatives passed the “Eliminate Barriers to Innovation Act,” introduced by Reps. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) and Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.) in March, making it the first major crypto-specific legislation to get through one of the bodies of Congress.      A number of other bills have also been introduced to define how cryptocurrencies can or should be treated under U.S. law, but few have made any progress.      “It’s the first bill to address regulatory clarity for digital assets and digital asset marketplaces to pass the house, and in a bipartisan fashion no less,” said Amy Davine Kim, chief policy officer at the Chamber of Digital Commerce.      Representatives for McHenry and Lynch did not respond to requests for comment.      According to the terms of the bill, a working group would be established with representatives from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), financial technology firms, financial firms regulated by the SEC or CFTC, academic institutions or advocates looking at digital assets, small businesses using financial technology, investor protection groups and entities supporting historically underserved businesses.      The group would have one year to evaluate the current legal and regulatory landscape for digital assets, how this landscape impacts crypto markets and how other countries approach the industry.      More important, the group would be asked to draft recommendations for improving the regulatory landscape (and, in turn, improving the markets), as well as best practices to minimize fraud and ensure investors are protected.      The bill asks that the recommendations be limited to the powers the SEC and CFTC already hold.      “It brings a number of stakeholders to the table, so it’s not just the SEC, it’s not just the CFTC, it’s also businesses and thought leaders who actually have expertise in the digital asset space,” Kim said.      Creating a working group with this many stakeholders also brings sunlight to the process of drafting or updating the regulatory framework around digital assets, she noted.      The next step is bringing the bill before the Senate. Right now the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, helmed by Senators Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and Pat Toomey (R-Penn.), is looking at the bill.      Kim said the Digital Chamber has already been in touch with some Senators to move the bill forward.      No sponsors have been named yet, according to a search of public records.      A number of other actions last week might further give heft to the idea of regulatory clarity coming to the U.S.      The House of Representatives Committee on Financial Services also renewed the Fintech Task Force last week, under the leadership of Reps. Lynch and Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), both of whom are returning to their roles.      “I’m hopeful that the work of this task force will continue to lay the foundation for a better understanding of these financial technologies, and today’s release of the fintech report is yet another step towards fostering financial innovation and keeping America competitive on the global stage,” Emmer said in a statement.    Paxos receives an OCC charter  What is going on in Turkey?    Two crypto exchanges abruptly closed up shop in Turkey last week, leaving hundreds of thousands of users at risk of losing potentially billions of dollars in cryptocurrencies. I asked my colleague Sandali Handagama, who has been following the situation, to explain what’s going on. Here’s what she told me:      Within days of each other, not one but two crypto exchanges have come under government investigation in Turkey, where digital assets are largely unregulated.      On April 20, Thodex, one of Turkey’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, abruptly shut down its exchange and operations, informing users the firm was considering a partnership with new investors. At the time of closing, the exchange was trading upwards of $580 million. The founder and CEO of Thodex, Faruk Fatih Özer, reportedly fled to Albania on the night before the exchange closed, according to local police.      On April 23, Turkish authorities shut down the bank accounts of another crypto exchange, Vebitcoin, after it, too, shut down its exchange citing financial difficulties. The following day, Reuters reported Turkish authorities had detained four people associated with Vebitcoin.      Thodex’s Özer claimed in an update on the exchange’s website that everything is fine, but Turkish police are now searching for him, enlisting Interpol in the process and detaining 62 other individuals associated with the company. Another four individuals associated with Vebitcoin have also been detained.      In response to the two incidents Şahap Kavacıoğlu, governor of Turkey’s central bank, said on Sunday that a wide range of crypto regulations is coming within two weeks, but ruled out an outright ban.      ""You cannot fix anything by banning crypto, and we do not intend to do this,” he said.      The fact is, completely banning crypto in Turkey is almost impossible to do. It’s a multi-billion dollar market locally where people have been free to purchase and trade crypto.      But then, suddenly, last month, the central bank banned the use of crypto for payments, although this did not have a long-term effect on trading.      Some people in the Turkish crypto community told CoinDesk they will welcome regulation, especially if it means protection from scams, but it remains to be seen whether the incoming regulations will be favorable to Turkey’s devoted crypto enthusiasts.    Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard    Gary Gensler was confirmed to be the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission for, like, the second week in a row, which is great news for Gensler and his proponents. Gensler was initially confirmed to serve out the rest of Jay Clayton’s term, which expires this year, at the beginning of April. On April 20, the Senate voted to confirm him for a full five-year term expiring in 2026. Regulatory clarity for crypto will be one of his priorities, said the Digital Chamber's Amy Davine Kim.    Elsewhere:  Millionaire Ex-Banker Who Hates Banks Starts a DeFi Firm in Russia: Former KGB officer, banker and newspaper owner Alexander Lebedev is launching a decentralized finance project called InDeFi, which allows customers to deposit DAI, BUSD or USDT and receive rewards in the form of interest and the company’s native token. The project’s white paper is a little vague on how exactly this works.  South Korea Kicks Off New Crackdown on Illicit Crypto Activities: Via CoinDesk Korea Global Editor Felix Im, South Korea’s Office for Government Policy Coordination is planning a “special enforcement period” to crack down on possible illicit activity around cryptocurrencies in compliance with a new law that’s gone into effect. Separately, the head of its Financial Services Commission warned that all local exchanges could be shut down, citing its new regulatory process (though if exchanges can secure a bank partnership and register before September, they may be okay).  Chinese Crypto Miners Face Unstable Regulatory Environment: Increased scrutiny of coal mines in China’s Xinjiang region and regulations on companies that draw a lot of energy in Inner Mongolia might ensnare crypto mining firms, which could, in turn, affect bitcoin’s hashrate. We saw a preview of what coal-powered miners being shut down might look like earlier this month, after several power plants were shuttered due to accidents in the (physical) coal mines.  Outside CoinDesk:  (Signal) This is what you might call a flex. Signal found a Cellebrite device that just so happened to “fall off a truck” and unpacked both how it works and how it might be exploited. Cory Doctorow has a good thread breaking down exactly what Signal’s Moxie Marlinspike did.  (Vice) Greenidge, a power generation facility that burns gas to create electricity, plans to more than double the number of bitcoin miners it operates, and received an important green light to do so last week. Environmental activists are concerned this will also lead to more pollution as the facility burns more gas to power the new miners. The next day, Square and Ark Invest published a report claiming bitcoin will incentivize greater use of renewable energy.

Figment provides infrastructure and tools for networks including Cosmos, Polkadot, Celo and Skale.  The team is “bullish on privacy” and the fund is dedicated to supporting projects with Figment’s validator or developer infrastructure, said Clayton Menzel, head of marketing at Figment.

Cosmos is a decentralized network made up of independent blockchains that utilize Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus mechanisms, including Tendermint BFT.  So far, $1 million from the fund has been allocated to a couple of projects the team is not ready to make public yet, Menzel said.

The round, led by Polychain Capital, included prominent backers Electric Capital, Coinbase Ventures, FBG Capital, CMS Holdings, Lemniscap, Cygni Labs and Walden Bridge Capital. Investors bought tokens in the future network.

Anoma will connect directly (point to point) to such networks via interoperability protocols such as IBC.      Read more: Cosmos Investors Vote to Approve Inter-Blockchain Communication      For example, the Anoma validator set has an account on Near and the Near validator set has an account on Anoma. When you move 100 DOT (Polkadot’s native token) from Near to Anoma, you move the DOT into the Anoma account on Near; as a result, the Anoma validator set credits you that 100 DOT on Anoma. Brink said you can now transfer and trade it freely on Anoma and later a different user can withdraw the 100 DOT (or a portion of it) back to Near.      Historically, such assets have been siloed on their hometurf, making it unwieldy for investors to quickly tap market opportunities.    Privacy specs    When it comes to privacy, Anoma uses a “multi-denomination zero-knowledge transfer circuit,” which enables different types of assets to share one anonymity set. An anonymity set is the set of entities that may have the same attributes, meaning they’re indistinguishable from each other.      According to Brink, Anoma’s multi-asset shielded pool is a specific kind of zero-knowledge circuit that allows for private transfers of arbitrary assets. It provides a unified privacy set for all assets and as such an observer can't distinguish whether a transfer contained 1 BTC or 1 SOL.

Put simply, it’s a cryptographic technique that allows two parties on the internet to verify information with each other without sharing or exposing underlying data related to this information.      Zero-knowledge circuits are used by projects such as ZCash (for private transfers), Tornado Cash (for building a trustless mixer) and Starkware (for building a fast decentralized exchange).      Open sourcing the code bank and launching the public testnet will go a long way towards determining whether Anoma can deliver on its ambitions.

42386571,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBU2df,1619528458,Helium to Launch 5G Network With Blockchain-Powered Mesh of DIY Telco Hubs,"Helium, a technology that uses blockchains and tokens to incentivize consumers and small businesses to run commercial telecommunications hubs, is launching a 5G version of its network.      Announced Tuesday, Helium is partnering with FreedomFi, a kind of do-it-yourself tech package for building 5G networks, so that participants can be paid to support the rollout of next-generation wireless networks, effectively by building their own mini cellular towers.      “What Helium has so far done with telecoms in the wireless space is almost like Airbnb enabling people to monetize their real estate in the form of a mini hotel,” Helium CEO Amir Haleem said in an interview. “Via our partnership with FreedomFi, we've learned there's an enormous opportunity to build a 5G LTE network where every house can basically have a miniature cell tower that carriers can use to offload traffic anytime they're near it.”      Blockchain-based decentralized economies have widened the gateway into industries in a way that can reward swarms of previously-uninvited participants, while also improving the fabric of such networks for the incumbents that operate on them.      Helium may be rare among Web 3 projects in that it’s attracted quite a few users.      The firm’s peer-to-peer internet of things (IoT) sensors – which are used for applications like keeping tabs on e-bikes, scooters or smart pet-collars – have gone from zero hotspots in 2019 to almost 30,000 today, with some 200,000 more already paid for and in the pipeline, according to Haleem.    Helium history    Founded in 2013 and backed to the tune of $53 million by the likes of Union Square Ventures and Multicoin Capital, Helium has seen strong growth since first releasing its low power “LongFi” hardware-based nodes and mining units in Austin, Texas, a couple of years back.      Read more: Crypto-Powered IoT Networks Are on Their Way to Over 250 US Cities      The Helium FreedomFi combination will use Citizens Broadband Radio Service, or CBRS (not to be confused with Citizens Band radio made popular by truckers), a spectrum authorized by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in January 2020, to allow wireless carriers to deploy 5G mobile networks without having to acquire special licenses.      Helium and FreedomFi highlight a new use case for CBRS, one that delivers on the initiative’s promise of innovation and creativity, former FCC Commissioner Michael O’Rielly said in a statement.      “Turning consumer gateways into network distribution tools and merging with ultra-hot cryptocurrency – consistent with the companies’ plans – may just be the step needed to help supercharge private 5G deployment,” O’Rielly said. “Now we get to see if the market agrees.”    HNT meets 5G    While people tend to think of 5G as delivering faster video streaming or making virtual reality more immersive, the biggest benefit relates to how its software-centric architecture will reduce operating expenses and ultimately help billions of people in emerging economies get connected.      “That might well be the biggest opportunity,” said FreedomFi CEO Boris Renski, adding:    “In the U.S. we are looking at carrier offload to make the networks bigger and better. But in the developing world, where there is no wireless network, you could imagine a whole universe of entrepreneurs that start their own wireless network businesses using this as the foundation and the technology.”    FreedomFi Gateways are now available for pre-order and are expected to ship in the third quarter of 2021.

42386574,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBU2gB,1619528237,"As Powell Heads to Fed Meeting, Inflation Data Can Only Get Worse","“It’s a really tricky needle to thread.” That’s how former Federal Reserve economist Claudia Sahm describes the task at hand for Chair Jerome Powell at the Fed meeting this week. Bitcoin (BTC) traders aren't sure he can pull it off.      Considering the massive economic dislocation over the past year from the coronavirus, the current level of interest rates and monetary stimulus appears to be just right, and data on everything from inflation to employment is about as good as one might hope.      Powell’s challenge will be to convince investors the Fed can maintain the pristine conditions even as the economy reactivates, potentially sparking a surge in consumer demand that could lead to faster inflation. Investors will be watching for any advance indications as to how quickly output would have to ramp up before the Fed moves to taper its $120 billion-a-month of bond purchases – an extreme form of loose monetary policy – and eventually raises interest rates, currently set at near 0%.      It’s a key question for traders in the market for bitcoin, seen by many big institutional investors as a hedge against the runaway inflation that might transpire if the Fed were to lose control. At issue is the credibility and resolve of the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, which is the panel at the U.S. central bank that sets monetary policy.      “The Fed is going to have to work really hard to convince people that they’re honest,” says Sahm, now a senior fellow at the Jain Family Institute. “Like if things get out of hand, they will adjust, they will raise rates, but they don't want them to think they're going to raise rates.”      According to economists at Bank of America, the second-biggest U.S. bank, investors in traditional markets will be focused on whether Powell shifts his language around when “substantial further progress” will have been made in the economy.      Economists at Bank of the West, a unit of the giant French bank BNP Paribas, project that Fed officials will start talking about tapering their bond purchases later this year, with the actual tapering to begin in early 2022. Under their scenario, the first interest-rate hike would happen in the third quarter of 2023.      The two-day, closed-door meeting starts Tuesday and culminates Wednesday with the FOMC decision at 2 p.m. ET. The FOMC press conference with Powell is right afterward at 2:30 p.m.      The FOMC decision will be closely scrutinized by traders in the bitcoin market, especially because this year's 90% price rally, fueled by speculation that faster inflation might be on the way, has stalled out in recent weeks. As of early Tuesday, bitcoin was changing hands around $55,000. It's bitcoin, of course, where price volatility is the norm, so anything can happen, but the largest cryptocurrency is well off its all-time high price reached earlier this month around $65,000.      The Fed meeting follows a string of several weeks of positive economic data.      The U.S. added 916,000 jobs in March, far above the expected 675,000, with pandemic-wrecked portions of the economy like leisure and hospitality leading the way.      U.S. headline inflation in March came in at 2.6% over the prior 12 months, slightly faster than the expected 2.5%, based on the Labor Department’s consumer price index (CPI). Even that result might not be anathema to the Fed, since Powell has explicitly expressed his wish for inflation to average over 2%, at least for a while.      Gross domestic product (GDP), the broadest gauge of economic activity, appears to be on a path toward robust growth. Oxford Economics has revised up its estimate for U.S. GDP this year to 8% from 7.2%, said Kathy Bostjancic, chief U.S. financial economist for the forecasting firm.      Such momentum means that markets may see a more relaxed and confident Powell on Wednesday, said Steven Kelly, a research associate at the Yale Program on Financial Stability, an initiative focused on understanding financial crises.      “If you would have offered everyone on the FOMC the last six weeks of data, they would have accepted the deal,” Kelly said. “If we were in 2019 and CPI was bumping up a little higher in a way that hadn’t been communicated, there would be volatility in the bond market. But they’ve been very clear that inflation will bump above 2%.”      With the yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes around 1.55%, down from as high as 1.7% in March, there’s little pressure on the Fed to consider experimental monetary policies like “Operation Twist” and “yield curve control” that might loosen financial conditions further.      Inflation-adjusted yields on 10-year Treasurys – the nominal yield, minus the inflation rate – are at negative levels, said Bostjancic. They’re currently around -0.77%, down from 0.15% before the pandemic. On that basis, the 10-year yield could climb roughly 0.9 percentage point before conditions returned to pre-pandemic levels. In other words Powell’s got plenty of headroom on that front.      Even though Oxford projects 1.9% for the nominal 10-year Treasury yield by the end of the year, the numbers add up to “near the easiest financial conditions we’ve ever had,” Bostjancic added.      The FOMC will likely stay the course on keeping the target rate for federal funds in a range of 0% to 0.25%, while maintaining the monthly asset purchases at $80 billion of U.S. Treasury bonds and $40 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities.      It might be a sign the Fed sees no urgency in beginning to normalize conditions, a step taken recently by the Bank of Canada.    The path to full employment    With 8.5 million Americans unemployed, there’s a long way before full employment is reached. Powell has talked about this, and it's likely to be on the agenda again at this week's FOMC meeting.      Lower unemployment could force businesses to compete for the shrinking pool of available labor, leading to higher wages. But higher inflation could also increase the cost of living, hurting the lowest income earners in society.      One trade-off is that inflation makes it easier for borrowers to repay debt, Sahm said.      “It helps borrowers on the reverse side,” Sahm said. “If there's higher inflation and wages tend to grow faster than prices, that means it takes less of your money down the road to pay back the bank. ... Most economists, who are rich people, do not talk about the distributional effects of inflation.”      What makes bitcoin traders skeptical is the so-called Goldilocks scenario: that everything stays exactly as it is for the Fed meeting this week, rising gradually and in sync. Corporations see increased profits as consumer demand rises, thanks to the Federal Reserve’s accommodative monetary policy and fiscal stimulus from the U.S. government. Investors benefit from an uplift of asset prices. Inflation ticks up a bit, but not too much. Eventually the Fed has enough legroom to remove the monetary stimulus.      “The Fed will eventually slow down the asset purchases and probably end the asset purchases,” Sahm said. “The whole point of this is to get the U.S. economy to a better place. If the economy is in a better place, we’re in a good place to invest and asset prices go up.”      Even after this week's Fed meeting has passed, getting there will be the tricky part.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/27/as-powell-heads-to-fed-meeting-inflation-data-can-only-get-worse,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/155792283dbd747d610477bd6a93dcb30462d088-1300x803.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386576,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBU2hR,1619518623,Bitcoin Options Market Eyes $4.2B in Expiries on Friday,"Bitcoin (BTC) has begun the monthly options expiry week on a positive note, rising from $48,000 to over $54,000.      Further gains may remain elusive for a while or unfold at a slower pace, as the max pain point for Friday's $4.2 billion options expiry is $54,000.      As discussed last month, call and put sellers, typically institutions with ample capital supply, often manipulate and pin the price of the underlying toward the max pain point while heading into the expiry.      Doing so ensures that maximum options expire worthlessly – buyers lose maximum money, that is, the premium paid while purchasing options, while sellers or recipients of premium make the most.      In other words, buyers of call and put options expiring on April 30 will suffer maximum loss if bitcoin settles at $54,000 on Friday. Meanwhile, sellers would make the highest profit. Therefore, option writers may try and keep prices around $54,000.      Almost all the options contracts expiring will do so at 8:00 coordinated universal time – the designated moment for monthly contracts traded on Deribit, which is the dominant exchange for cryptocurrency options.      It is difficult to prove whether max pain pinning is real or coincidental because bitcoin's options market is still relatively small for the expiry to have a sizable impact on the spot price.      At press time, the total number of outstanding bitcoin options contracts – or open interest – is around $13 billion or 1.3% of bitcoin's total market capitalization of $1.03 trillion, according to data source Skew.      Further, only 77,000 contracts worth $4.2 billion are set to expire this Friday. That's 0.3% of bitcoin's market capitalization.      Nevertheless, traders can benefit from keeping an eye on the max pain, especially as expiry nears.      ""Options and futures are new critical datapoints for traders. While bitcoin was up +103% in the first quarter, we saw huge pullbacks end of each month,"" Messari researcher Mira Christanto recently noted in a tweet thread detailing the effect of max pain on bitcoin's price.      The month-end pullbacks happened as back then the max pain point was well below the spot price. For instance, the cryptocurrency fell from nearly $60,000 to $50,000 in the six days leading up to the March 26 expiry but did not go all the way down to the then max pain point of $44,000.      Also read: Bitcoin Price Jumps 9%, Most Since Early March      The max pain turned out to be a temporary bearish hangover because the cryptocurrency reversed course after the expiry and clocked highs above $60,000 on April 2.      This time, the cryptocurrency has bounced to the max pain point ahead of the expiry. At press time, bitcoin is changing hands near $54,500, representing a nearly 1% gain on the day. Prices rose 10% on Monday, the biggest single-day percentage gain since Feb. 8, according to CoinDesk 20 data.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/27/bitcoin-options-market-eyes-42b-in-expiries-on-friday,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/71533dcfbe0a9a04710b2954b64bac32c47d9eed-1280x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Their goal is to escape poverty and amass enough wealth to buy a home, a dream many young people worldwide feel is out of reach.      ""I face the reality of being unable to afford my own home no matter how hard I save up my salary,"" said one anonymous worker cited in the report.
