The main purpose of the Muir Glacier upgrade is to delay a planned increase in the difficulty of mining new units of cryptocurrency by an estimated 611 days, according to a Dec. 16 post on the blog Ethereum Cat Herders, which is dedicated to community-led project management on the blockchain.      The delay comes amid concerns the so-called ""difficulty bomb"" would essentially increase the time needed to confirm new blocks of data on the network, resulting in a ""degradation in the usability of ethereum due to waiting for confirmation for transactions.""      The upgrade was expected, but the move to schedule it for New Year's Day sparked a negative reaction among some network users who had planned to take the day off along with colleagues.      Jorge Izquierdo, CEO of Aragon One, which allows groups of people to form organizations using the ethereum blockchain, tweeted he's ""trying hard not to be negative about ethereum lately.""      ""Now someone from my team has to work on a day that they were free,"" he wrote.      In a subsequent tweet, Izquierdo wrote that Aragon wouldn't implement the upgrade on his platform's infrastructure until Jan. 2.      According to Ethereum Cat Herders, the latest upgrade was needed ""so soon after the last one"" because prior estimates of the timing of the difficulty increase proved wrong.      ""In order to avoid a delay with the Istanbul upgrade, it has been decided to address the difficulty bomb aka Muir Glacier upgrade as a separate one,"" according to the post.      Ether, the main cryptocurrency for the ethereum network, was changing hands at $129 on Monday as of 5:26 p.m. universal coordinated time (12:25 p.m. in New York), down 0.7 percent over the prior 24 hours. That was the worst performance among digital assets with a market capitalization of at least $1 billion, according to the data provider Messari.

42431318,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1jLh,1577121764,"Unlike Libra, Digital Yuan Will Not Need Currency Reserves to Support Value: PBOC Official","The head of the People's Bank of China's (PBOC) digital currency research subsidiary, Changchun Mu, said China's cryptocurrency will not need a currency basket to maintain a stable value.      Speaking to reporters at The China Finance Association Academic Annual Meeting and China Finance Forum Annual Meeting in Beijing Saturday, Mu said the digital yuan would be distinct from other forms of cryptocurrencies, including Libra.      ""The [digital yuan] currency is not used for speculation. The RMB is used to spend, not for speculation. It does not have the characteristics of bitcoin speculation, nor does it require the currency basket assets to support the value of the currency like stable currency,"" Mu said, as reported by Shanghai Securities News.      It's unclear whether PBOC has any alternative mechanism in mind for pegging the value of the digital yuan to the traditional renminbi.      PBOC's Digital Currency Research Institute has reportedly been developing the digital yuan, officially known as the Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP), over the past five years. A former PBOC official said last month the bank envisions two main use cases for the digital yuan: to facilitate retail payments and create a new medium for cross-border payments.      Officials only began revealing details about the coin soon after Facebook unveiled Libra earlier this year. Also designed as a cheaper and faster remittances solution, Libra's value is set to be pegged to a basket of major world currencies, including euro, sterling and U.S. dollar, supplied by Association members. China, which is reportedly concerned about private money initiatives taking market share, is expected to be the first major economy to launch a central bank digital currency (CBDC).      Talking about the digital yuan's developmental roadmap, Mu said PBOC engineers had nearly finished. ""At present, the digital currency DCEP of the People's Bank of China has basically completed the top-level design, standard formulation, functional research and development, joint debugging and testing,"" he said.      The bank would soon be at the point where it could start gradually issuing the digital yuan to Chinese citizens through its commercial partners, which include Tencent and Alibaba-backed Ant Financial, Mu added.      Although critics have expressed concern China could use its digital yuan to increase surveillance on its citizens, Mu has said the bank will guarantee cash-like levels of privacy for transactions while still being able to trace what it suspects to be illegal activity.      PBOC stated back in November that the digital yuan was still in the testing stage after a website claimed it would launch Nov. 20.

The exchange said in a blog post Thursday its new ""Level 1"" accounts will only require users to register with an email address and password. ""Any customers who sign up from here on out can begin trading in seconds with a Level 1 account,"" according to the post.      Level 1 users can deposit and trade an unlimited amount of cryptocurrency. They can also withdraw a maximum of $10,000 every day. There are also opportunities to stake proof-of-stake (PoS) coins on the platform.      Poloniex users have reportedly requested the exchange provide a means to trade cryptocurrency ""without giving up on their identity,"" the blog post reads. It continued, ""To our long-time unverified customers, we know how frustrating your experience has been recently and we’re dedicated to improving that for you.""      The exchange will update older non-KYC verified accounts to the new level 1 tier, a process expected to take several months to complete.      Payments company Circle spun out Poloniex in October, less than two years after it acquired it for $400 million. Weeks later, Tron founder Justin Sun revealed he was part of a group of investors that acquired the exchange from Circle, also for a reported $400 million.      Poloniex moved from Delaware to Bermuda, when it was a Circle subsidiary. The exchange, which firewalled U.S. residents in November, has said it will now focus on business elsewhere. U.S. residents had until Dec. 15 to withdraw remaining funds from the exchange.      Poloniex first introduced KYC checks in early 2018 to comply with existing identity and verification requirements. In May, the exchange said users who hadn't completed the KYC checks would have their accounts frozen within 14 days.      Back in 2015, founder Tristan D'Agosta said the exchange was legally obligated to follow rules set by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Now that it has completely ceased its U.S. operations, those rules may no longer apply.      Other non-U.S. based exchanges have similar withdrawal limits.

42431333,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1jph,1577114656,Into the Ether: Majority of All ETH Wallets Now 'Out-of-the-Money',"Ether is down significantly from record highs and the majority of its holders are losing money on their investments.      The second-largest cryptocurrency, which powers ethereum's blockchain, is currently trading at $131, representing a 90 percent drop from the all-time high of $1,431 reached in early January 2018, according to CoinDesk's ether price index.      The relentless price slide has pushed 90 percent, or 31.31 million, of ether addresses “out-of-the-money,'' according to blockchain intelligence firm IntoTheBlock.      An address is said to be out-of-the-money if the current price of ether is lower than the average price at which the coins were acquired or sent to an address.      So, the 31.31 million ether addresses have acquired coins at an average price higher than the ether's current value of $131.      A major chunk of out-of-the-money addresses purchased coins in the range of $211 to $530. Notably, the biggest cluster, some 4.77 million addresses, is in an average cost range of $262 to $352.      About 3.58 million addresses have purchased coins in the range of $745 to $1,340. Since it was launched, ether has so far traded above $747 only for six months, from the meteoric rally of October-December 2017 until its price slide in the first quarter of 2018.      Meanwhile, a mere 8 percent or 2.79 million addresses are “in-the-money” - the cost of acquisition is lower than the current price of ether - and 1.78 percent addresses are “at-the-money,” with an average purchase purchase price almost equal to the current spot price.      The majority of the in-the-money addresses have acquired coins in the range of $0 to $130, while 4,120 addresses have an average cost of $0. These could be early buyers who bought ether in the period between August 2015 and December 2015, when the cryptocurrency was trading in cents.      While the number of addresses in-the-money is small, the volume of ether these addresses are holding is quite significant.       Only 8 percent of addresses are in-the-money, but hold 31.24 percent of the total ether held in all addresses. That amounts to 34.05 million ethers ($4.5 billion). These investors have already seen their massive profits evaporate in the last 23 months and may offload their holdings if prices find acceptance under $100, adding to bearish pressures around ether.      Out-of-the-money addresses are holding 73.13 million ethers. Clusters of addresses with an average price in the range of $144-$170, $212-$262, or $262-$352 are holding a total of 36.24 million ethers.     Brutal second half    The number of addresses in-the-money may have been higher at the end of the second quarter of this year, when ether was trading near $360.      The cryptocurrency rallied more than 120 percent in the first six months of 2019 only to drop by 54 percent in the second half.      Indeed, ether is not the only cryptocurrency to have faced intense selling pressure in recent times. The broader market has taken a beating, courtesy of bitcoin's drop from June highs above $13,800 to recent lows near $6,400.      However, bitcoin, the top cryptocurrency, is still up 103 percent on a year-to-date basis. Ether, on the other hand, is reporting a marginal year-to-date loss at press time.      A few observers believe ethereum's persistent scalability issues likely dented investor confidence, leading to a price drop.      ""Ethereum has consistently missed deadlines for protocol upgrades,"" said Connor Abendschein, research analyst at Digital Assets Data, to CoinDesk. “Ethereum 2.0 was supposed to have already gone into effect earlier this year, and it still hasn’t gone through.""      Ethereum 2.0 is a major network upgrade that will shift the blockchain's current proof-of-work consensus algorithm to proof-of-stake and transfer validation function from miners to special network validators.      Under proof-of-work, miners compete with each other to solve a difficult puzzle (algorithm) to add each block to the chain. Under proof-of-stake, there is no competition as the block creator is selected based on the user's stake in the project - in other words, ether holdings.

42431320,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1jNh,1577109600,"Corporations Need Bitcoin, They Just Don't Know It Yet","This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Chris Dannen is co-founder at Iterative Capital, a New York-based cryptocurrency investment manager, and CEO of i2 Trading, a wholesale dealer and trading desk.      Anyone who has attended cryptocurrency conferences in 2019 has experienced the narrative confusion that hit after the ICO bubble. “Blockchain” companies push lame enterprise products that are, at best, nice to have; token issuers shill new issuances; exchange operators search for capital.      Who isn’t there? Big corporate technology customers. Like any technological device of the last 50 years, cryptocurrency needs to catch their attention before large-scale adoption is feasible.      But two years after the bubble, killer apps are nowhere to be seen. So at the start of a new year, it’s worth asking ourselves what sort of path might bitcoin and its competitors take to get there, and whether 2020 is an inflection point.      Whatever the path and timeline, the transition period for corporations building on bitcoin is sure to be painful; at a big company, technological change always is. Automating payroll, invoicing, expense reporting and other financial operations on top of the bitcoin network would be a slow and expensive process, requiring a massive amount of time and money spent on building software and retraining workers.      Only an extremely serious problem could be the impetus for such a scenario. Does such a problem exist today, and if so, how might cryptocurrency solve it?    The speed of corporate implosion    Consider a few data points:    In 1958, the mean lifespan of a blue-chip company was 61 years; by 2016 it had dropped to 24 years.  Almost three-quarters of a billion hours per week are spent by U.S. workers on internal compliance activities, roughly half of which do not create value.  The return on assets of the top 25 percent of public companies declined from 12.9 percent in 1965 to 8.3 percent in 2015.  Things are going badly for workers, too; since 1976, productivity growth (from technology) has outstripped wage growth by a factor of 5.9.*    From Nokia to Microsoft to Borders to BlackBerry, incumbents fail again and again to preserve their market position and grow wages, despite all the market data they vacuum up each year, all the consultants they pay and all the bright young college grads they hire.      This is a big problem. Why is it so?      The problem is digital technology has advanced the “practical arts” (from spreadsheets to moviemaking) to such a degree that advanced planning and hyper-efficient processes – once strengths of the large hierarchical organization – are no longer as valuable. In an unpredictable, ad-hoc business environment, agility rules and bureaucracy are a drag.      If bitcoin and similar networks can’t help large companies become more agile, they may have little relevance in the economy of the next 20 years. What is the path to utility?      The philosopher Bertrand de Jouvenel theorized we can reason about the future by conceiving of “futuribles.” “A future state of affairs enters into the class of ‘futuribles’ only if its mode of production from the present state of affairs is plausible and imaginable,” he wrote. “A futurible is a descendant of the present, a descendant to which we attach a genealogy” that extends from conditions today.      What are the “conditions” of the whirlwind corporate world of the last decade? In their attempts to move faster and forestall their early demise, the largest incumbents have begun to reorganize to reduce hierarchy and push more decision-making to the margins of the business and away from upper management. What is the corresponding futurible as we look to the 2020s?      What sort of operating model might corporations be forced to adopt next as the physical world digitizes and the speed of business further increases?    The dual-OS company    While he’s never written about cryptocurrency, Harvard Business School professor John P. Kotter originated the concept of “the dual-operating-system company,” which combines a traditional hierarchical management organization with a “network” of supertemps, some paid and some unpaid, outside the office walls.      Hierarchies, he says, are good for planning, creating budgets, defining roles, HR functions and measuring results. “What they do not do well,” he wrote in the Harvard Business Review in 2012, “is identify the most important hazards and opportunities early enough, formulate creative strategic initiatives nimbly enough, and implement them fast enough.”      He advocates what he calls a “second operating system,” a network of people who design and implement strategy from outside. The network half of the dual-OS company is like an immune system for the traditional corporate hierarchy, constantly surveying the business, its markets and its competitors to bring new information and practices in.      Kotter says about 10 percent of the network should be comprised of full-time employees, and the rest carefully selected part-timers and volunteers who are given highly structured processes to make sure their contributions are meaningful, and whose work is seen at high levels of the hierarchy.      There are a few practical problems with an ideal implementation of Kotter’s dual-OS model, however, especially with a very large network. One is payroll. If roles are nonstandard with varying schedules of compensation for part-time, full-time and contract work (and payees constantly dropping on and off at high volume), an army of HR staff would be needed to handle the load. It’s even worse if paychecks are being remitted around the world to a network of external contributors, in places where the business doesn’t have a local office.      Could it be dual-OS is the panacea to ailing corporations and it needs a new sort of financial infrastructure to be implemented economically?    Where bitcoin comes in    Bitcoin is, at heart, infrastructure built for (and by) leaderless groups, operating by emergent consensus. Examples of leaderless groups include not just FOSS developers but also hashtag-based movements like #metoo, or Occupy Wall Street-style protests like the Arab Spring in 2011. In Kotter’s dual-OS company, the “network” half is one such leaderless group.      Bitcoin is ideal infrastructure for leaderless groups because wallets can be issued without permission and bitcoin payments are easy to automate, giving companies the flexibility to pay people in very small or very large amounts, at large scale, anywhere in the world.      Another headache of dual-OS is budgetary permissions. Companies like to set thresholds where staff can spend money with or without permission, but these rules are often not very granular at the corporate credit card level, and enforcing them otherwise can be hard. Custom wallet software, perhaps with multi-signature functionality for large wallets, can help companies put the spending power in the hands of employees, reducing the bottleneck of managerial approval by formalizing the spending rules into the wallet software iself.      Remittance is another issue, for corporations and their employees overseas. Remote offices often need to remit payment back home, but forex conversions can be difficult, slow and expensive in some geographies. Employees working in far-flung places need to be paid locally but also like to send money home; fees and delays abound with existing financial systems. The increasingly global nature of business means that suppliers, manufacturers and logistics agencies may need to be paid in dozens of different currencies.      Thus, the dual-OS operating model seems like a valid futurible for today’s corporations, and its challenges create a need for digitized financial infrastructure.      To the business world, bitcoin and its competitors are effectively competing to be the premier inter-settlement-network network. That is, networks that transmit value between poorly connected fiat systems, filling gaps where other services are too expensive, bureaucratic or slow.      Before long, local money transmitters will be able to push large amounts of value cheaply and instantly through Lightning (or similar) channels from one country to another, meaning their customers never even need to own bitcoin to benefit from the technology to remit value overseas.      This has been a cursory look at how bitcoin might find its way into the mission-critical enterprise stack. In an attempt to remain agile, large incumbents have already begun to wrap themselves in permeable networks, even without knowing how such a dual-OS structure might scale. As they grow their networks, it’s only a matter of time before the cryptocurrency narrative regains its strength.      *Data from Aaron Dignan’s new book, Brave New Work.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Chris Dannen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/12/23/corporations-need-bitcoin-they-just-dont-know-it-yet,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/88e1773223073f8cd5e6ac94e3ddff2439f25e08-1197x854.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The company announced Monday that Chief Product Officer Mike Blandina has become the new CEO of the company, effective Dec. 20. He succeeds outgoing CEO Kelly Loeffler, who was recently appointed to become the next U.S. senator from the state of Georgia. Adam White, the company's chief operating officer, will serve as the company's president.      Blandina joined Bakkt in April following stints at PayPal and Google. He comes from a background in payments tech, having been director of engineering at Google's Wallet project.      White, who was one of Coinbase's earliest employees, joined Bakkt in October 2018.      Loeffler has run Bakkt since its formal announcement in August 2018, overseeing the company as it worked to launch its physically delivered bitcoin futures products, the first such in the U.S.      Under her tenure, Bakkt also announced it would be launching options on top of its existing futures, as well as cash-settled bitcoin futures through a Singapore-based affiliate.      Both of those products went live earlier this month.      Her successor, Blandina, will continue to oversee Bakkt’s expansion, including the rollout of a consumer-facing retail app meant to facilitate small-item purchases using bitcoin. Starbucks, which was announced as a research partner when Bakkt was first launched in 2018, will be a launch partner for this app.      Bakkt is also expanding its warehouse efforts, recently naming Galaxy Digital as a client for the latter’s new bitcoin funds.      Georgia Governor Brian Kemp announced he would appoint Loeffler to fill current Sen. Johnny Isakson’s seat at the beginning of December, making her the first crypto company executive to serve in the upper chamber of the U.S. legislature. In her introductory remarks, Loeffler praised U.S. President Donald Trump, who wanted Congressman Doug Collins to fill the seat, but did not mention bitcoin or cryptocurrencies.      Loeffler will be sworn into office on Jan. 1, 2020. In a statement released the day her appointment was made official, ICE said she would have to step down from her CEO position during the transition.      Notably, Loeffler appears to be the first ICE executive to hold a “CEO” title at one of the exchange’s subsidiaries. While ICE itself has a CEO in Jeffrey Sprecher, Loeffler’s husband, its subsidiaries appear to be run by presidents or other C-level executives, including ICE Futures US (Trabue Bland), ICE Clear US (Hester Serafini), ICE Data Services (Lynn Martin) and ICE Futures Singapore (Lucas Schmeddes).

42431322,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1jRh,1577106000,2020 Vision: 7 Trends Bringing Blockchain Into Focus in the Year Ahead,"This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. David L. Shrier is a futurist and globally recognized authority on financial innovation, with dual appointments at MIT and the University of Oxford's Saïd Business School. His next book, Basic Blockchain, is being published in January 2020 by Little Brown (Hachette).      2020 brings us the start of a new decade, and with it comes the gradual maturation of blockchain technology, bringing it down from the stratosphere to tangible impact on real-world problems. We may be a turning point for the industry.      These seven trends are bellwethers for the industry’s health I will be tracking in 2020, as we move from experimentation to implementation:    1. Blockchain, naturally    A challenge I have found over the past several years of educating blockchain entrepreneurs in over 130 countries in my work at MIT and University of Oxford is the need for more compelling use cases. Not just any use case, not just any scenario where distributed ledgers might be applicable, but natural uses cases where blockchain is clearly a superior platform versus other database technologies. I am hopeful 2020 will bring a more acute perspective from the industry on where blockchain is best used and scaled.    2. Games people play    The $300 billion videogame industry and the $94 billion online gambling world (near-term projected growth) represent interesting application areas for blockchain.      John D’Agostino, founder of Digital Assets Working Group, says, “Gaming and commodification of the gaming experience” is what’s in for 2020. He goes on to state that he sees opportunity in “combining the theoretical fungibility, transparency and security of blockchain databases along with the ease and portability of tokens to create new markets for digitally native assets and experiences like online gaming.”      (What’s out, asserts D’Agostino, is “blaming securities laws for your bad business model.”)    3. Bitcoin is back (or it never left?)    Bitcoin remains the most financially successful blockchain project to date, with a market capitalization of more than $130 billion at this writing. For the longest time, heeding the words of my collaborator Meltem Demirors, I would tell people that you can train a mediocre bitcoin developer in a year or a competent ethereum developer in a month.      Bitcoin is idiosyncratic, a hack of hacks, a giant kludge that outgrew itself a long time ago. Ethereum and other newer protocols were developed more self-consciously with third-party development in mind. And yet, bitcoin is suddenly top-of-mind again, and I have anecdotally been hearing of various bitcoin-protocol projects under way.      Jack Dorsey, as it happens, is moving to Africa for several months, and in relation to that views bitcoin in the African continent as a game changer. Indeed, Michelle Chivunga, advisor to the African Union, says, “With the Africa Free Trade Area agreement in line to transform the continent, Africa is in strong position to play a leading role in the digital revolution tapping into key technologies like blockchain. Africa's time is now.”    4. China giveth and China taketh away    The People's Republic of China, in a matter of weeks, announced a warm embrace of blockchain on the one hand and began aggressive enforcement actions against crypto companies on the other.      Tracking price movements of bitcoin recently has given me whiplash. I have long told people I don’t speculate for my own account because I can’t predict the price movements of crypto well enough to make money. November is a good example as to why. I also note that in some regards bitcoin represents a competitor for the newly announced RMB central bank digital currency, so the Chinese government has a vested interest in talking down the price.    5. Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) at center stage    For the past several years I have been spending increasing amounts of time with governments and multi-governmental bodies, discussing how to shape innovation policy that supports fintech and blockchain. My colleagues and I have been seeing rising interest in central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), not only with China and Venezuela, but in a variety of nations, large and small.      Simon Chantry, co-founder of Bitt.com, tells me:    “In 2019 we saw many Central Banks investigating and in some cases testing various blockchains and distributed networks for use in the financial system. While initially hesitant to move efforts forward past the test phase, the emergence of competition in the form of private sector digital currencies and ‘stablecoins’ has prompted Central Banks worldwide to evolve their own technology strategies. I suspect we will see more tangible progress on Central Bank-issued digital currencies in 2020, as Central Banks seek to leverage many of the technological advancements that have taken place over the past decade to provide their countries and economies with advanced, secure, and efficient payment systems.”    Chantry should know. Bitt.com is credited by many insiders as originating the first blockchain-based CBDC in 2016.      We expect more CBDCs to be announced in 2020, and with them a greater focus on cross-border interoperability.    6. 'Custody is king'    Sometimes the “plumbing” of the financial system, while less glamorous than token offerings or a new ewallet, is essential for any of the other great ideas proposed around blockchain to function. One such area is custody, the physical or electronic holding of assets for safekeeping, and a gating condition for serious institutional investment in digital tokens and cryptocurrencies.      “Absent robust custody standards the industry can never scale,” according to SALT Chairman Ben Yablon. “Single founders disappearing with hundreds of millions of dollars in value shouldn’t and won’t be allowable if the space is ever going to reach its potential.”      The industry is going to work out better standards and practices around custody in 2020 – or risk another Cotten.    The Government of Mauritius, gateway to the African continent, has planted its flag in the sands of digital asset custody. It’s not such a dumb bet. State Street’s $32 trillion empirehttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/lgim-centralises-global-trading-onto-140000287.html is built on custody of securities.  7. Cybersecurity? What’s that?    I never cease to marvel at the fact that cryptocurrencies, developed by cryptographers and sometimes (often) held by highly (and healthily) paranoid people who seek ultimate security for their money (not even trusting central banks), have persisted in serious cybersecurity inefficiencies.      A few years ago I had the privilege of talking to 30 of the top cybersecurity experts in the world as we put together MIT’s cybersecurity book. The blockchain world, as it turns out, isn’t notably better than anybody else at cyber-protection – and in some cases is worse.      2019 saw possibly $200 million or more stolen from various exchanges, and perhaps more unreported hacks occurred as well. I am hopeful 2020 will see better cyber-hygiene and cyber-practices. You will be hearing more from me on this topic in the months ahead.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | TOKEN SALE,David Shrier,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2019/12/23/2020-vision-7-trends-bringing-blockchain-into-focus-in-the-year-ahead,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7f520477115e92887820f8b623bb25ab9644bb89-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42431330,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1jhh,1577106000,Smashing Through Surveillance Capitalism With Blockchain,"This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Jack Henderson is co-founder and president of RadicalxChange Students. Glen Weyl is founder and chair of the RadicalxChange Foundation and Microsoft’s Office of the Chief Technology Officer Political Economist and Social Technologist.      The web instilled in us the hope of replacing the old social hierarchy with a network of networks. Yet, important gaps in the structure of the internet, its lack of provisioning for trust and identity across social distance, left a vacuum that was filled by a small group of powerful platforms. These days, many believe we are doomed to a continuous societal decline into surveillance capitalism and political division.      Decentralized, rules-based databases such as blockchains offer us the hope of overcoming some of the limitations of the early internet systems that could enable the original promise to be more fully realized. However, early experiments with cryptocurrencies have been, among other things, wasteful, subject to speculative bubbles or taken over by ideological factions of wealth. Cypherpunks who hope to fairly and efficiently govern their communities, or even an important aspect of society like currency, are realizing they need to think more carefully about the rules of these systems lest they fall into other versions of the traps of Web 1.0 and 2.0.      Indeed, if we want sustainably egalitarian and decentralized societies, the rules, “mechanisms” and “political economy” might be as important for the future of technology as the data structures that enable them.      Thus the increasing interest from the blockchain space in questions of political economy. Our vision of property rights, which has been widely discussed and explored in the community, helps limit speculators’ control over assets. Quadratic Voting, deployed in the Colorado State House of Representatives with the help of Democracy Earth as well as many other countries and companies, shows significant signs of delivering in practice on its theoretical promise of generating more consensual governance than other methods. Quadratic Finance, which Gitcoin has used in several successful rounds to fund open-source software, is a flexible method to use community matching funds to optimally identify emergent, bottom-up public goods.    Our proposals are the result of seeing political and social institutions as technologies to be carefully built and improved.    Our proposals are the result of seeing political and social institutions as technologies to be carefully built and improved, a viewpoint the blockchain space has embraced. We can move past extremes, factions and gridlock and attempt to deal with the increasing complexity of our times if we realign incentives toward compromise and allow for cooperationacross difference.      We believe this is a fruitful and generative way of thinking that represents a promising way forward -- and this is only the very beginning. Our first annual conference in Detroit last March welcomed nearly 500 people, of which about half were from the blockchain space. We held another conference in Berlin in November, and our second annual conference will be held next June in São Paulo. Conversations started at these events and continued online are leading to an exciting and rapid evolution of the ideas.      For instance, we are developing a more sociological view of individuality – a major blindspot in Radical Markets, which was very much still stuck in the economics worldview – that recognizes the rich sociality of modern life.      It is the diversity of human organizations we participate in, not our independence from them, that defines our individual identity. And it is precisely by allowing more fluid, democratic and diverse social organizations to emerge and flourish that we can actually individuate ourselves by all the unique ways in which we participate in sociality.      Thus the common promise of some blockchain rhetoric - to break down existing institutions and the need for trust - would paradoxically undermine individuality and freedom rather than enable them. Only by empowering and proliferating communities can we actually create the conditions for individuals to flourish.      Further, the social systems our political economies try to convey are far more complex than what is formalized by reductive institutions like nation states and money, which strip away public goods, cultural meaning, identity and most other forms of human sociality.      We can become much more socially complex and have more powerful political economies if we develop formal systems of value, reputation and culture that actually represent the social relations people have to each other.      In this regard, the mechanisms we and others propose must be improved. The issue is not that there are selfish individuals and we need mechanisms to coordinate them toward the common good. Rather, as highlighted by our board member Danielle Allen, there are diverse individuals who are part of and committed to different social groups. Living in a society with lots of differences is what makes the contemporary world so vital and yet it also creates conflict that makes everyone living together challenging.      Thus, the key issue is how to have cooperation under conditions of diversity – a primary focus of ongoing research.      This is a movement for renewing liberal democracy that welcomes a diverse range of people and perspectives who help along many different dimensions. Blockchains are an exciting testing ground for the ideas and we look forward to their lessons, lessons that are increasingly being applied to politics around the world as we cooperate with more than a dozen political parties and governments around the world.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,"Glen Weyl, Jack Henderson",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/12/23/smashing-through-surveillance-capitalism-with-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5e964c3b86eba0e4c0c5f46d9aaf69b0a95fbc5d-1200x675.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431325,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1jdh,1577102400,Why the SEC Asked Blockforce Capital to Pull a Bitcoin ETF Proposal as Soon as It Was Filed,"When Reality Shares ETF Trust, a branch of Blockforce Capital, pulled its filing of a proposed exchange-traded fund made up of 15 percent bitcoin and 85 percent global currencies, many observers assumed the company made a mistake. It turns out the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission previously told the asset management firm that it could file the proposal — only if it pulled it immediately afterward, according to Blockforce’s CEO.      The proposal was filed under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which would have resulted in it becoming automatically approved within 75 days. Yet, the firm followed the regulators' suggestion and pulled the proposal just a day after it was filed. The SEC declined to comment on whether or not it had given the initial proposal a green light.      “They said, ‘We liked the idea … but we’re going to ask you to pull it immediately because we don’t want to see it get approved just yet,’” Blockforce CEO Eric Ervin said. “They were really interested and engaged on it. They came back to us and said, ‘If you did it as an interval fund, then you might have a chance.’”      With an interval fund, investors can only get in and out of the fund once per period (usually weekly, monthly or quarterly), making it less vulnerable to manipulation. The regulator worried a fund that traded throughout the day and had open liquidity would be subject to manipulation. The fund also trades on the net value of the underlying asset, rather than on large premiums of the asset.      “If we had more resources at the time, we probably would have done it and tried to get an ETF approved,” Ervin said. “We had a lot going on in the business, and we put it on hold.”      For Blockforce, a seasoned ETF issuer that had already launched a blockchain-based ETF, getting the ball rolling on an eventual bitcoin ETF and being the first to release a proposal for something like one was more important than keeping its idea a secret between Blockforce and the SEC, Ervin said.      Blockforce developed the diversified and bitcoin-conservative ETF to put the regulator at ease; even if bitcoin went to zero, investors would only lose 15 percent. According to Ervin, the regulator saw an opportunity to get more public comment on a contentious issue.      “It was a known fact that we would need to file if it was going to go on the public record,” Ervin said. “It puts another application for people to comment on. The SEC has been really eager to get comments on a bitcoin ETF or an ETF with bitcoin in it.”      Ervin predicts the industry will eventually get a pure bitcoin ETF passed when the SEC’s leadership changes, and envisions current Chairman Jay Clayton stepping down and commissioner Hester ""Crypto Mom"" Pierce becoming the new head.      Bitcoin is a valuable volatile asset for any portfolio, Ervin added. If any portfolio is rebalanced regularly, two volatile and uncorrelated assets that are bought low and sold high can help to dampen overall volatility.      “A bitcoin ETF is a perfect example of an non-correlated alternative asset that works well to balance out a portfolio of just stocks and bonds,” Ervin said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/12/23/why-the-sec-asked-blockforce-capital-to-pull-a-bitcoin-etf-proposal-as-soon-as-it-was-filed,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/41c6ce80544a8dac20cc89e002792410efc1aaf6-2560x1709.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431316,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1jJh,1577091600,Lawsuit Shows How a Public Firm's $80M Bet on Bitcoin Miners Went Terribly Wrong,"In March 2018, shortly after bitcoin’s bull run to $20,000, a publicly-traded Chinese company invested 500 million yuan, worth $80 million at the time, to buy 100,000 bitcoin mining units.      As the bear market kicked in during the months that followed, so, too, did a contract dispute, offering a rare window into Chinese public firms tapping into bitcoin mining as a new business stream and reflecting the prolonged magnitude of last year’s market sell-off.      The $80 million mining investment made by Beijing Cailiang, an app developer fully-owned by Shenzhen-listed Wholeasy, brought home almost negligible profit return in 2018. Yet it dragged the company into a lawsuit involving $15 million in debt and a potential criminal case with accusation of fraudulent public disclosure.      Though the amount at dispute may seem insignificant, the case sheds light on the increasing investments by institutions in China into an area where even public entities typically shy away from public discussions.      The missing bitcoin miners    Gaming app and marketplace provider Wholeasy, with now a $500 million market cap, disclosed last Thursday that Chinese law enforcement has opened a criminal case against bitcoin miner supplier Ebang. Wholeasy’s Cailiang subsidiary filed the complaint, accusing Ebang of committing sales fraud.      That evening in China, Ebang, one of the three Chinese bitcoin miners that attempted to go public in Hong Kong in 2018, said in an urgent response that Cailiang filed the police report in a malicious attempt to play the victim.      The miner maker released a dozen pages of sales contracts and delivery receipts as supporting documents to debunk Cailiang’s story. Ebang said it had already filed a separate report to financial regulators in China accusing Cailiang of fraudulent disclosure on its liability as a public company.      The escalation followed a civil contract dispute case over an unpaid amount of 100 million yuan, worth $15 million, as part of the two parties’ $80 million bitcoin miner sales agreement in March of last year.      Ebang sued Cailiang in April 2019, demanding the defendant to pay the remaining overdue balance for the shipment of all 100,000 units of bitcoin miners. However, Cailiang claimed that it had only received 65,000 units and thus shouldn’t be liable for the remaining payments. The case was tried on Nov. 26 and is pending the judge’s ruling.      “Their malicious report to the police is nothing but an attempt to escalate it to a criminal case to interfere with a civil lawsuit,” Ebang said of its miner buyer's motivation.      Following the news on Friday, Wholeasy’s share price dropped by eight percent on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. It has further declined by 10 percent as of press time during China's Monday trading hours.      As of June 30, Wholeasy’s cash in its current asset on the balance sheet was $7 million, down from $10 million on Dec. 31 2018.    $80 million investment    Started out as a gaming app developer and in-game ad distributor, Cailiang was fully acquired by Wholeasy in July 2017 under the condition that it should bring the parent company a net profit of $7 million, $8 million and $10 million for 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively.      Soon after the acquisition, Cailiang kicked off a business unit during Q4 2017, amid bitcoin’s price surge, that it called a “high capacity cloud computing server business and hosting service”, according to Wholeasy’s 2017 financial report.      There was no mention of bitcoin, mining, miner or even blockchain in the report. That year, Cailiang made $5 million in net profit on a revenue of $21 million.      But Cailiang’s 2018 financial report indicated that the only new business area that it had expanded into in the year was “a new cloud computing server (miner) brokerage and rental service” available for individual and institutional customers.      In fact, Cailiang incorporated a mining farm in July 2018 called Mobcolor, headquartered in California with offices in Colorado and North Dakota.      And Cailiang’s 2018 revenue indeed saw significant growth with $52 million, more than double compared to 2017, while the net profit grew to $8.2 million.      But assuming Cailiang’s gaming business made the same revenue and profit in 2018 as it did in 2017, its mining-related business may only have brought home $3 million in net profit on a $31 million revenue.      And that’s after the $80 million investment, which bought 100,000 units of Ebang's older E9+ model that have a much shorter utility life compared to more advanced products that hit the market recently.      Further, Cailiang doubled down in 2018 on its research and development cost on crypto-related services including a mining pool and, notably, a crypto exchange service despite China’s tough stance on crypto trading activities.      Based on the 2018 financial report, as of October last year, Cailiang completed the main development work for “a digital asset exchange that offers crypto-to-crypto as well as over-the-counter trading for mainstream digital assets such as BTC and ETH.”      The firm said the main goal of the exchange is to facilitate assets trading for overseas mining customers via its mining pool in order to “improve its profitability.”    Winding down?    Based on Ebang’s sales agreement with Cailiang released in its Thursday response, the bitcoin miners sold to the buyer in 2018 was the E9+ series, at a price of 5,000 yuan each, or $720.      At bitcoin’s current price, mining rewards and difficulty, these machines can only make a slightly positive daily return if electricity costs falls below $0.04 per kilo-watt hour, according to f2pool’s mining profitability index.      As such, the valuation of these units in the second-hand market likely won't be anywhere near the original price. The ask and bid prices for more widely-used Bitmain's AntMiner S9 can now be seen around $100 to $150.      Cailiang’s financial report for the first half of 2019 indicates that mining-related service is no longer among its top three businesses, although it had acquired another $3 million worth of mining equipment with ongoing mining site construction.      For the first six months of 2019, Cailiang made $3.5 million in net profit on an $18 million revenue, not yet half way through the promised target of $10 million in net profit. The company has not responded to email request for comment.      The crypto market’s downturn, especially in the second half of 2018, had caused more than 600,000 miners to shut down amid a broader industry reshuffle.      But bitcoin’s price rebound since March 2019 rejuvenated interests in mining, pushing bitcoin network’s mining difficulty to an all-time-high near 100 exahashes per second (EH/s) around October.      As bitcoin’s price has largely remained unchanged over the past month, the network’s total computing power kept steady at the 90 EH/s level.      However, faster and more efficient mining machines than the allegedly unpaid-for E9+ models are already in place elsewhere, so it may be too late for Cailiang.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Wolfie Zhao,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/12/23/lawsuit-shows-how-a-public-firms-80m-bet-on-bitcoin-miners-went-terribly-wrong,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0e333d10f7806919a67575a9f0f8ce81c05c728c-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
