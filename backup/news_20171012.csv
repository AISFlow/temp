42427904,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL4brh,1507851057,Nasdaq CEO: Exchange Is Staying Away from ICOs,"The CEO of global stock exchange operator Nasdaq said this week that her firm is steering clear of initial coin offerings (ICOs).  Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman, speaking at the Financial Markets Quality Conference at Georgetown University, criticized the lack of investor protection and disclosure standards among organizers that use the blockchain use case.  Through ICOs, blockchain-based tokens are sold via public sales in order to bootstrap the development of new networks. But the use case has attracted criticism for the prevalence of fraud, drawing the attention of regulators worldwide.  It's for that reason, Friedman said, that Nasdaq is staying away.  She told attendees at the event:  ""I would call (an ICO) a bleeding edge type of construct. Nasdaq doesn't tend to get engaged in the bleeding edge.""  Friedman's comments are notable given that Nasdaq has been publicly working with blockchain since 2015 in a bid to create new capital markets for startups. The exchange operator has also filed a number of patent applications that seek to apply the tech.  Her remarks also come after the top US regulator for financial markets moved to strike a critical stance toward ICOs.  Earlier this month  , SEC Chair Jay Clayton told a Congressional committee that ICOs are ""a ripe area for pump-and-dump,"" which could have a negative impact on adoption of the use case's underlying tech.  However, he also said he is ""cautiously optimistic"" about the SEC's ability to track and end fraud cases in the US.

42427906,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL4bxh,1507843851,Wall Street Analyst Bernstein: Bitcoin Is a 'Censorship Resistant Asset Class',"Bitcoin is a ""censorship-resistant asset class"" – but not quite money – according to analysts for New York-based firm Bernstein.  In a note sent to clients on Wednesday, according to Business Insider, analysts explored that question, ultimately concluding that while it shares some of its characteristics, it falls short under what would be considered ""money"" today.  ""Fiat money is still the final form of settlement – governments still collect taxes in fiat money and salaries are still paid in fiat money,"" the note explained. ""Thus, for now, Bitcoin has only emerged as a 'censorship resistant' asset class.""  The analysts notably reckon that bitcoin's ecosystem functions more like a self-reliant economy than, say, strictly a network of digital money.  ""Bitcoin could be seen as virtual 'bearer cash' economy supported by a decentralized 'trustless' network – a new crypto economy with its own protocol or policy,"" the firm wrote in the note. ""The faith of its citizens – software developers, miners, investors, early individual and sovereign state adopters [–] would drive the value of that network.""  Bernstein's determination is unlikely to sway proponents who say cryptocurrencies represent a new form of money. Indeed, it's a sticking point that has drawn both supporters and critics for as long as bitcoin has been in the public eye.  Some observers have struck a middle ground in the argument. Last month, investor and anarcho-capitalist Doug Casey argued that while bitcoin might be money, it's not likely to last in the long-run.

Prime Minister Miro Cerar was speaking at the Digital Slovenia 2020 gathering on Wednesday when he gave a wide-ranging speech on blockchain. During the remarks, he notably declared that the government ""want[s] to position Slovenia as the most recognised blockchain destination in the European Union.""  He touted the country's startup community, and also disclosed that the government is looking at administrative applications of blockchain.  Cerar stated:  ""The regulatory bodies and ministries are already studying blockchain, and the state is participating in activities at European level in the area of the introduction and regulation of this technology. We are also already laying the foundations for the initial pilot testing of the technology in the state administration.""  The think tank will likely play a role in these ongoing efforts.  The recently inaugurated group – announced on Oct. 3 – will act as a point-of-contact between blockchain developers, industry stakeholders and the Slovenian government, while also coordinating with different companies to create educational materials on the technology. The country's Ministry of Public Administration is formally backing the effort, which will play a role in developing new regulations around the tech.  According to the prime minister, Slovenia is looking to throw its weight behind the tech in a broad way.  ""Slovenia as a whole is therefore setting itself up as a blockchain-friendly destination, and to that end it is establishing the pillars of a national blockchain ecosystem in the area of the transfer and spread of information, the adoption of legal regulations and the promotion of a supportive environment for the development of companies working in the area of blockchain technology,"" Cerar remarked.  His remarks closely follow statements from Slovenia's Financial Stability Board, which said that blockchain innovations ""are welcome from the perspective of the development of the country.""  In the same release, the board also warned citizens against investing in initial coin offerings and cryptocurrencies, noting that neither are regulated in the country.

15990249,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/bitcoin-struggling-africa,1507836604,Why Bitcoin Is Struggling In Africa,"Despite there being so much potential for Bitcoin in Africa, it would appear that the uptake has been surprisingly slow. To put it simply, Bitcoin is a monetary system for the unbanked. It is trust less and far less corruptible, and can create a new monetary system where there is no long legacy of banking and financials, but still, even though this is the case, right across the continent in different countries, it has not taken off at the same speed it has in other countries. South Africa and Nigeria are some of the biggest players in Bitcoin, but it is the smaller nations like Tanzania, who are seeing big growth, but with small numbers. What could be causing this struggle? One of the biggest issues that Bitcoin is facing is that people simply do not have enough knowledge surrounding digital currencies. Educating people about the industry would go a long way to bridge this gap, but at the moment, it is still a compete minefield for those who are actively using it, so trying to teach a whole continent about it is no mean feat. As a whole, Africa is a cash-based infrastructure, with a simplistic model, where even conventional banking is still a very novel concept to a large proportion of the population. Bitcoins, and digital currency just therefore isn’t a clear alternative, which naturally means that their adoption into the industry is very slow. Chad Robertson, who is the co-founder and chief executive officer of South African startup Regenize, echoes this belief that education and awareness will help matters; “Specifically, in South Africa, we have such a huge gap that keeps on growing regarding wealth, but also knowledge, on the ever-changing tech landscape. If I’m sitting in a coffee shop in the CBD, it’s quite likely someone will know what Bitcoin is. However, head down to the Cape Flats or townships (slums), and it’s highly unlikely that there’ll be many people who are aware of it.” Interestingly though, he does go on to say that the root cause of this struggle cannot be blamed on education alone, and rather the unwillingness to accept because it is just not relevant to them or their needs; “…This lack of education and awareness could be drilled down further on to find the root cause. There are too many people living in poverty in South Africa and Africa. They simply cannot think about using Bitcoin, as it’s not relevant to their needs. The local Spaza shop does not accept Bitcoin, so how will someone get their bread or milk? Schools don’t accept it for school fees. You cannot buy electricity with Bitcoin to keep your lights on. So why would they care or want to be educated on it?” It has to be argued that he makes a valid point. How can you expect something to grow in an area where there is simply no need for that product? Is this the only issue? Africa is hugely diverse with a massive gap between rich residents and poor. Those who are less financially secure have not heard of it, or have no need for it, and those who are, have other issues…namely how secure it is. In order for Bitcoin to fully take off and become more widely accepted, these security concerns must be addressed before the residents will adopt to the idea. Robertson again, backs up this argument saying; “There are many people who’ve been scammed on the internet, especially those who are digitally uneducated. Therefore, there’s a fear and a stigma around using the internet as a place to transact”. From this, it is easier to see why Bitcoin as a concept is struggling to take off in this continent.

At press time, the parity client, maintained by U.K.-based Parity Technologies, and which supports roughly 25 percent of all ethereum nodes, has yet to release software that includes the protocol changes needed for the shift. The delays come at a time when most other major versions of the software have already published their releases ahead of Sunday's likely fork.  But while not yet cause for alarm, the wait could foreshadow issues. That's because, in order for a successful hard fork to occur on ethereum, all nodes must update their software with a release that contains the block number as well as any agreed protocols.  When the block number is reached, these upgrades are automatically triggered across the network – unless there's a problem with the software.  Notably, Parity has released two Byzantium-ready releases in the past week, however, both were found to contain a ""consensus bug,"" meaning that Parity nodes would not have been able to communicate with the remaining network, causing the blockchain to split.  At present, Parity developers are working hard to get the release out on time.  According to Ether Nodeshttps://ethernodes.org/network/1/forkWatch/parity, 17% of Parity clients are running faulty Byzantium software, while 80% have yet to upgrade at all. If the release isn't ready on time, it could release some very sticky complications down the line.

In that sense, eSports’ ERT token can contribute to this goal through gaming, although economic inclusion is not its main goal. There are already a few strong use cases for ERT as an agent of economic inclusion, namely in countries in which the local economy cannot provide enough opportunity to the people who live there. Venezuela is probably the best example. Venezuelan Economy and the Need for Cryptocurrencies Hugo Chavez, Venezuela’s late president, changed that country’s economic model gradually, imposing capital controls and a series of other economic measures that effectively chocked the economy. As a result, Venezuela is now facing the worst bout of hyperinflation since Zimbabwe was forced to stop issuing its own currency in 2009. In Venezuela it is just as hard to keep track of inflation now, as it was back then in Zimbabwe. The only advantage that Venezuelans have that Zimbabweans didn’t, is the advent of cryptocurrency to protect themselves from the appalling economic choices of their government. To protect themselves from hyperinflation – which according to the Bloomberg “Café con Leche” index is at around 650% - Venezuelans started mining for bitcoin. The fact that electricity is heavily subsidized in Venezuela, provides instant profitability regardless of BTC volatility. Nevertheless, increased mining has put a strain on Venezuela’s generation capacity. The government reacted to the mining phenomenon by actively looking for miners – presumably taking electricity consumption data to locate them – to arrest them. This is where a token like ERT can give Venezuelans and people in other countries who are facing similar economic hardship, a way out. ERT Provides Economic Inclusion Through Gaming eSports.com will effectively create a gaming-based economy through its platform. In this economy, anyone anywhere in the world, will be able to contribute and get paid in ERT tokens for their contribution. In the case of Venezuela, this will allow a gamer to share their expertise through the platform in a variety of forms, to earn tokens. That player can then exchange those tokens in the open market, where eSports will also buy them back. This will allow our hypothetical Venezuelan gamer, to earn a living without being subject to hyperinflation, while they avoid the crackdown on mining activities within the country. Although this kind of economic inclusion is not the main focus of the ERT token, by virtue of being a token with a clear use case within the eSports gaming platform, and being inflation-resistant, ERT can become a cornerstone for global economic inclusion through gaming.

15989284,http://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/ert-token-promotes-global-economic-inclusion-gaming,1507828131,ERT Token Promotes Global Economic Inclusion Through Gaming,"One of the most pressing needs that cryptocurrency can address at a global level, is economic inclusion. In that sense, eSports’ ERT token can contribute to this goal through gaming, although economic inclusion is not its main goal. There are already a few strong use cases for ERT as an agent of economic inclusion, namely in countries in which the local economy cannot provide enough opportunity to the people who live there. Venezuela is probably the best example. Venezuelan Economy and the Need for Cryptocurrencies Hugo Chavez, Venezuela’s late president, changed that country’s economic model gradually, imposing capital controls and a series of other economic measures that effectively chocked the economy. As a result, Venezuela is now facing the worst bout of hyperinflation since Zimbabwe was forced to stop issuing its own currency in 2009. In Venezuela it is just as hard to keep track of inflation now, as it was back then in Zimbabwe. The only advantage that Venezuelans have that Zimbabweans didn’t, is the advent of cryptocurrency to protect themselves from the appalling economic choices of their government.

In a statementhttps://www.kronofogden.se/66713.html, the Kronofogden (known also as the Enforcement Authority) said today that it would sell roughly 0.6 BTC, an amount worth roughly $3,200 at press time. Though the statement didn't explicitly state the source of the funds, local media reports indicate that the debt was assessed against a local company.  The agency said that it would begin the auction today, which is scheduled to last through next Thursday, and called for interested parties to reach out about participating.  Johannes Paulson, the agency's operations developer, said in a statement:  ""Assets are not just the car on the driveway or the money [in a] bank account. We live in a digital world, and now we are looking for assets in computers and hard drives as well as in telephones and web services.""  With the move, Sweden becomes the latest government to auction off holdings of the cryptocurrency.  The U.S. government, for example, held several auctions of bitcoin it obtained through its investigation of the now-defunct dark market Silk Road. As previously reported, the government has only just taken possession of the proceeds from those auctions following a long legal fight with convicted Silk Road operator Ross Ulbricht.

42427886,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL4Xph,1507821333,Rally Restored? Bitcoin Is Up 75 Percent from 30-Day Lows,"Fresh off setting a new all-time high this morning, bitcoin is once again increasing its 2017 gains.  Yet for those just tuning in, it might not be immediately obvious how strong the cryptocurrency's recent performance has been or the conditions under which it's seen the boost. After all, as recently as mid-September, bitcoin's perceived bubble had all but burst when the price fell from $5,000 levels to below $3,000.  Yet, out of this doom and gloom, bitcoin has seen a phenomenal rally, delivering more than 70 percent returns in under 30 days.  Further, it's done so in the face of powerful headwinds – China, the world's largest market had just banned ICOs, throttling a thriving use case, and there is still the silent specter of yet another upcoming fork that could split the network, this time more acrimoniously.  So, while criticism of bitcoin continues in some quarters still, bitcoin is paying no heed. Love it or hate it, the number one cryptocurrency by market value has been outperforming popular markets by a big margin.  Comparison chart  Just how big is the performance? The chart below outlines bitcoin's price movements from its September 15 low, as compared to gold, the U.S. dollar index and the S&P 500.  The comparison, while not perfect, is a useful one as it provides a perspective on how well bitcoin is performing against common basis points. The S&P 500, for example, is the most traded global benchmark, while the U.S. dollar index provides a snapshot of the prices of paper currencies that inspired bitcoin's quest for a digital alternative.  It's also useful to look at bitcoin against gold – another similarly scarce asset.  Still, over that time, bitcoin's 75 percent rally has rocketed past the anemic gains seen in S&P 500 and the U.S. dollar index. Meanwhile, gold prices shed 1.66% over the same period.  Looking at those figures, bitcoin is clearly ruling the roost (even despite a negative regulatory atmosphere in some jurisdictions).  Further, such strong performance could become a self-feeding cycle, with more investors entering the market for its stellar returns, and hence pushing prices higher.

It's a statement that comes a month after his now-infamous declaration that the cryptocurrency is a ""fraud."" Dimon made the remarks during a third-quarter earnings call with reporters this morning, as cited by CNBC.  He reportedly said:  ""I wouldn't put this high on the category of important things in the world, but I'm not going to talk about bitcoin anymore.""  During the call, JPMorgan chief financial officer Marianne Lake was quoted as saying that the bank is ""open-minded for digital currencies that are properly controlled and regulated.""  Dimon has something of a history of making strong statements on bitcoin. On September 12, during an event hosted by Barclays, he said that the cryptocurrency, in his view, is ""worse than tulip bulbs,"" a reference to the 17th century speculative bubble in Dutch tulips. ""It won't end well. Someone is going to get killed,"" he said at the time.  Dimon later doubled down on his comments, predicting that bitcoin would be targeted by governments.  Dimon's ""fraud"" remark last month triggered a wave of commentary from Wall Street figures, with some siding with his position, while others adopted a more neutral stance.  By contrast, some commentators have taken issue with the ""fraud"" remarks, arguing that the cryptocurrency's foundation is based on a rejection of the banking system.

42427888,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL4Xth,1507813204,Why HODLing Is Hobbling Bitcoin's Prospects as a Common Currency,"Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk's advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT's Digital Currency Initiative.  In this opinion piece, one of a weekly series of columns, Casey argues that bitcoin's appeal as an investment could diminish its effectiveness as a currency and calls for testing alternative cryptocurrency models.  Bitcoin traders like to say their best trading strategy is not to buy and hold, but to buy and ""HODL"" – hold on for dear life.  For the umpteenth time, it's paying off. Bitcoin's price has rebounded from a sharp drop in September, overcoming a bout of wild volatility that would scare off even the most seasoned Wall Street trader from other markets. Despite a slew of unambiguously negative news, from China shutting down bitcoin exchanges to a looming fork in the cryptocurrency's code that threatens chaos and acrimony in the community, here we are again with a new all-time high of over $5,200 set today and quite possibly more ahead.  I see two core reasons why bitcoin commands such value – no doubt to the bafflement of people like JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon.  One is somewhat tautological, and that is the fact that bitcoin exists at all, that it seemingly cannot die. As if to confirm the HODLers' worldview, circumstances like those of the past two months tend to test, and ultimately prove, the contention that bitcoin's decentralized design can resist any effort to shut it down, whether from outside or within its community of users.  That's what’s valuable about it. The more bitcoin shrugs off attacks, the more it highlights its core value as an immutable currency of the people.  The second pillar beneath bitcoin's value is its scarcity. Although bitcoin will keep generating new coins until its total supply reaches 21 million in 2140, the protocol has front-loaded that distribution such that 80 percent of those are already in users' hands. That petered-out distribution function will keep bitcoin scarce into the future.  There is, however, a paradox here: this scarcity feature could actually undermine bitcoin's appeal as a currency.  HODLing = hoarding  In its aspirations to fulfill the three functions of money – a store of value, a medium of exchange and a unit of account – bitcoin could be cursed by success. The built-in scarcity, up against expectations for growing demand for an immutable financial instrument, has created an awesome store of value for the decentralized, digital economy of the 21st century.  Bitcoin is in this narrow sense is a much better, highly liquid, digital version of gold. But so long as all these HODLers keep coins out of circulation, there won't be enough of them around for people to use it to buy goods and services.  Yes, payment processor BitPay is reporting a surge in transactions, but such gains come off a very low base. The vast majority of bitcoin transactions aren't commercial in nature, and a number of merchants that experimented with bitcoin in 2014 and 2015 have since stopped accepting it.  As a portion of global commerce, bitcoin is a pipsqueak.  This particular failure is likely to continue even if one or both of the two sides sparring over how to scale bitcoin's transaction throughput succeed in their goal, whether through on- or off-chain solutions. Fast, low-fee transactions won't entice people to part with their bitcoin if they perceive that it's more valuable to hold it. In keeping with Gresham's Law that ""bad money drives out good,"" they'll instead transact in an inferior currency. Such as the dollar.  Of course, any decent, functioning currency must be somewhat scarce in order to hold its value; no one wants to accept Venezuelan bolivars right now. But as many economists often point out, neither should a currency be overly appealing as a store of value. If too many people hoard the currency, too little gets into circulation as a medium of exchange, which in turn makes it less likely to be quoted as a unit of account.  This theory suggests that an ideal monetary policy includes a small amount of inflationary expectation. It's why most central banks formally target a 2 percent inflation rate, signaling that they intend to find a balance between too much and too little monetary expansion. The problem is that many of them fail to achieve that goal and end up debasing the currency, in the form of excessive inflation like Venezuela's, or create harmful deflation, as with Argentina's currency peg in 1991. Perhaps there's a better, automated way to optimize monetary policy so that people both save and spend their currency – ideally with a cryptocurrency that no one can shut down.  Of course, it's virtually impossible to imagine bitcoin's algorithm ever being altered to increase its supply. Users, miners and businesses would never agree to such a diminishment in its value proposition.  It's fair to say we'd never have bitcoin – and the broader field of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology – if Satoshi Nakamoto hadn't built in a scarcity feature to bootstrap demand for it. But now that the precedent has been set, developers of altcoins have an opportunity to experiment.  Experimenting with inflation  That's what's happening at the MIT Media Lab's Digital Currency Initiative, where I am a senior advisor. The DCI has launched K320, an experimental cryptocurrency that's the first application of the cryptokernel blockchain toolkit developed by researcher James Lovejoy.  K320 starts out with a bitcoin-like frontloaded release schedule for its first eight years, but then slots into a steady increase of 3.2 percent every year after that. It's modeled on Milton Friedman's ""k-percent rule,"" which posits that money supply should be increased by a fixed rate annually, regardless of the state of the economy.  The 3.2 percent number is a best-guess attempt to establish a rate of increase that's high enough above the common 2 percent central bank inflation target to create sufficient expectations of depleting value for people to use the coin ­­­– but not so high that it encourages them to dump it.  But we can only know by testing it. It might be that a more dynamic model is needed, one in which, for instance, money supply is adjusted automatically, based on a digitally verifiable measure of the velocity of transactions. What's needed is new field of crypto-economic experiments.  Whatever the results of these studies, I don't think bitcoin investors have anything to fear. In the long run, bitcoin's immutability, in-built scarcity and political neutrality give it the potential to become a kind of global reserve currency for the masses – a digitally native backstop that everyone owns, much as countries hold dollar reserves as a form of national insurance.  Still, the real promise of cryptocurrencies is that they let us overhaul our broken monetary and payment systems, making them less oppressive, more efficient and accessible to all. We need a unit of value that people will readily exchange with each other.  And for that, a heavily HODLed, deflationary asset just won't cut it.

However, in subsequent days, bitcoin's price quickly regained, reportedly due to a pick-up in trading volumes in Japan, South Korea and other markets.  Increased institutional interest seems to have played a role in boosting bitcoin prices.  For example, a rumored ""bitcoin desk"" at Goldman Sachs would certainly be a game changer for the nascent market. Still, it's just the latest sign professional traders are increasingly interested in the market.  Further, even while skeptics continue to call the bitcoin rally a bubble, the price action analysis indicates no serious trouble ahead for the cryptocurrency.  Weekly chart  The chart above shows that:  Bitcoin is chipping away at $5,154 – resistance offered by 161.8 percent Fibonacci extension of the move from the April low – June high – July low.  The RSI is overbought, although it's not a cause for concern, as the indicator is still well below the highs seen in August and June.  Daily Chart  View  A break above $5,154 would open doors for $5,378.56.  A healthy technical pullback cannot be ruled out, given the overbought conditions. On the downside, the key support levels to watch out for are $5,000, $4,809, $4,500.

42427876,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL4XXh,1507802417,US State Department Seeks Blockchain Boost Amid $10 Billion Reboot,"The U.S. agency that oversees foreign affairs is looking seriously at blockchain.  That's according to John Sullivan, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State, who encouraged the State Department and its private sector partners to embrace the technology as a way to ""advance diplomacy and development objectives"" at the Blockchain@State forum held Tuesday in Washington, D.C.  Speaking to an audience comprised of other government agencies, members of the private sector and non-profits, Sullivan went so far as to suggest blockchain could be a key part of the massive restructuring of the department proposed by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who leads the agency.  Sullivan told attendees:  ""This forum has implications for our ongoing redesign efforts. We're interested to learn whether blockchain technology can have direct applications to many of the key features of our proposed redesign.""  Tillerson first proposed the redesign, which seeks to save as much as $10 billion over five years, in September. And while Sullivan acknowledged blockchain isn't a ""panacea"" to the agency's problems, he emphasized that he's keen to see the technology used to improve internal processes and capture efficiency gains.  The forum explored numerous ways in which blockchains might improve core agency mandates such as administering foreign aid, promoting democracy and improving governance and political institutions in U.S.-allied countries.  With that, Sullivan (who was appointed by President Donald Trump and sworn in this May) urged the agency and its stakeholders to think hard about how the technology could be deployed in a diplomatic context to strengthen national security and promote greater economic prosperity.  Identity is in  And at least some industry participants are taking Sullivan's encouragement to heart.  For instance, Joseph Lubin, founder and CEO of ConsenSys, the New York-based blockchain development firm that co-sponsored the event, argued that a blockchain-based self-sovereign identity scheme could have an immediate and far-reaching impact toward the agency's goals, especially those that have to do with humanitarian aid.  Lubin told CoinDesk:  ""Once people own their own identity, then they're less enthralled to their governments and less subject to adverse situations like natural disasters and wars. So, if someone is ejected from their country, if they've already established self-sovereign identity they can reconstitute their life.""  Other speakers at the event agreed, with Ashish Gadnis, CEO of BanQu, a provider of identity and financial services in developing countries, highlighting the importance of end users owning, controlling and possibly monetizing their personal data.  ""All the aid we give to refugees is one-sided. This means that they are recipients of transactions from people like us, yet ... they don't exist because they don’t own or control their own data,"" Gadnis said.  Sullivan also gave credence to the idea that blockchain could combat pervasive challenges in the area of foreign aid distribution such as corruption, fraud and the misappropriation of funds. He continued, saying these same challenges might not only be solved in aid distribution, but also in other areas, such as eliminating the corruption in government's control over land title registries in the developing world.  While the concept of a blockchain-based self-sovereign identity has been a favorite of the industry, it's a particularly hard problem to fix – one that some believe depends on how advanced smart contract technology becomes, another area Lubin called attention to.  In his mind, constructing international frameworks and treaties using smart contracts could serve as a means to combat the ""free rider"" problems associated with agreements like the United Nations or NATO, both of which deal with member countries frequently failing to fulfill their financial commitments with little consequence.  U.S. wakes up  Yet, the State Department's forum comes amid increasing interest by government agencies throughout the world to understand and harness the technology. While some governments have moved to ban cryptocurrency and the tools that have come from it, most are taking a more open-minded approach.  ""Blockchain technology is on the move around the world, so it is, therefore, essential that we better understand this cutting-edge technology as it becomes more ubiquitous in our economy,"" Sullivan said, highlighting ongoing distributed ledger projects in Estonia, Georgia, Dubai and Singapore.  Sullivan's bullish remarks, coupled with growing interest from the State Department and other agencies within the U.S. government, are being well-received by the blockchain community.  Not only was ConsenSys a presence at the forum, but distributed ledger consortium R3, enterprise blockchain firm BitFury and a handful of industry startups were in attendance.  ""We're particularly excited that the U.S. is waking up, big time, and realizing that this is a transformative technology,"" said Lubin, adding that he hopes the country will emerge as a critical agent in advancing the technology worldwide.  Lubin said:  ""There are other smaller players who are embracing this technology strongly, but we do want to see America get out in front of this and transform society with it.""

The bill, first filed on October 6 according to public records, outlines the rules for exchange services, including taxation and data redemption requirements. Notably, the bill calls for cryptocurrencies to be taxed as a kind of property, mirroring the approach taken by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, which released a similar determination in 2014.  It also includes a section on cryptocurrency mining – the energy-intensive process by which transactions are added to a blockchain, creating new coins as a reward – stating that the proceeds are also subject to taxes.  The legislation's introduction is notable development, given that in August, the country's central bank hinted that it may move to regulate cryptocurrency activities in Ukraine.  If the bill is passed and signed into law, the National Bank of Ukraine would have two months from that date to create guidelines for exchanges. Further, it mandates that the Ukrainian government ""ensure that the ministries and other central executive bodies bring their normative legal acts into compliance with this law,"" according to a translation.  It remains to be seen what changes will be made as the bill moves through the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine's national legislature.

42427874,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL4XRh,1507795221,Just SegWit? Bitcoin Core Is Already Working on a New Scaling Upgrade,"Bitcoin's core developer team isn't yet done scaling the cryptocurrency's protocol.  Despite the fact that a years-in-the-making change called Segregated Witness (SegWit) activated on the network just over six weeks ago (with businesses and users now slowly updating and average block sizes inching upward), the upgrade has already started a chain reaction of work on other optimizations geared toward accommodating more users.  So, while businesses and miners are pushing for more aggressive scaling via the controversial Segwit2x proposal, the open-source team behind bitcoin's most widely used software is focused on other efforts entirely. Called ""Schnorr signatures,"" the technology offers another signature scheme option alongside Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). One benefit is that it supports ""signature aggregation"" on the bitcoin blockchain.  While that may sound complex, the change aims to consolidate activity that already takes place on the network with each transaction. Under the ECDSA scheme, each piece of a bitcoin transaction is signed individually, while with Schnorr signatures, all of this data can be signed once.  And doing so could improve bitcoin in a few key ways, according to developers working on the effort.  Blockstream engineer Jonas Nick told CoinDesk that this method of mashing signature data together should be considered ""low-hanging fruit for helping bitcoin scale.""  First, by decreasing the number of signatures, it increases the amount of transaction data that can fit into each block. Second, by merging signatures, the technology could enhance privacy by making it harder to determine where transactions are coming from.  Third, it's believed the change could curb ""spam attacks,"" where one entity sends a bunch of small bitcoin transactions that take up extra space in the blockchain, potentially making nodes more difficult to run.  Success through failure  Though the new signature technology has been an idea since at least 2013, developers have recently made some breakthroughs, bringing Schnorr signatures closer to actual implementation on bitcoin.  SegWit was the first necessary step in that the code change, which moves signature data to another part of the block, making Schnorr (or something like it) possible to implement with a backward-compatible software upgrade (soft fork), where it wasn't previously.  Then, most recently, developers stumbled upon under-the-radar cryptography research that could help them build the algorithm faster.  According to a transcript of Bitcoin Core's annual meeting over the summer, developers submitted a paper outlining their signature aggregation scheme to Financial Cryptography and Data Security 2017. While the conference committee rejected the paper – asserting that the security proof for the signature aggregation scheme provided in the paper was too flimsy – they also suggested another paperhttps://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~mihir/papers/multisignatures-ccs.pdf, which provided a stronger security proof.  Bitcoin Core contributor Bryan Bishop told CoinDesk:  ""This is important and useful because it means that the cryptography has been studied in the past to a further extent than we previously thought.""  With this work already done, developers can spend less time ironing out the security signature scheme, and more time figuring out how to implement it on bitcoin.  Next steps towards reality  Blockstream's Nick points to an in-progress bundle of code changes called ""aggsig module"" as the main place where Schnorr signatures are being worked on.  Code contributions – from Andrew Poelstra, Greg Maxwell, Pieter Wuille, Peter Dettman and others – date back as far as 2012, showing this module as the most advanced in terms of being worked on over the longest number of years.  While many developers there have turned their attention to optimizing the performance of the Schnorr code implementation to make sure the verification of signatures is as fast as possible, Nick said, there are still some missing pieces to the aggsig module before it can be fused into bitcoin itself.  For example, bitcoin's OP_CHECKSIG function checks to see if someone really owns the bitcoin they're trying to send. Currently the function does not take the new Schnorr signatures into account, meaning it can't do the aggregating signatures, said Nick.  ""There's no public proposal yet specifying how [that] would exactly work,"" he explained, adding that developers need to write up some sort of a roadmap for the new function, before it can be implemented.  Still, he was optimistic that the change will not take long to implement, calling it ""relatively straightforward.""  Nick concluded:  ""The right people just need to find time to focus on it.""  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which helped organize the Segwit2x scaling proposal, and has an ownership stake in Blockstream.  Correction: An earlier version of the article misstated where Schnorr signatures can be used. That has been corrected.
