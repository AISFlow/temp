14133295,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=539433,1687562321,Bitcoin Just Gained Over 18% In Seven Days: What’s Happened When This Has Occurred In The Past?,"By the completion of its daily candle on Wednesday, Bitcoin had gained over 18% in just seven consecutive sessions, abruptly ending the steady drift lower which had dominated its price action since Bitcoin put in its mid-April high above 30,000. How unusual is this magnitude gain in only a week’s time, and what’s happened in the past after similarly robust rallies? Let’s take a closer look at Bitcoin’s price history to find out. Bitcoin’s Price History Suggests Higher Prices Ahead As we examine Bitcoin’s price history for which there is reliable data (2011 to the present), the number one cryptocurrency by market cap has experienced numerous instances of gains greater than or equal to +18% over the span of seven days. Bitcoin gains >= 18% in Seven Days | BTCUSD on TradingView.com Related Reading: Bitcoin Recovers Above Critical Level, Why Bulls Could Be Ready To Charge Because the number of occurrences will vary depending on holding time, we’ll start by listing the number of times this has happened next to our hypothetical hold times of 7 days through 90 days. Holding time is defined as the amount of time one held Bitcoin before exiting. For example, if one hypothetically purchased Bitcoin following the trigger event (i.e., +18% over the span of seven days) and sold it 30 days later, this would be a holding time of 30 days. Bitcoin Occurrences of +18% Gains in Seven Consecutive Days by Holding Time (2011 – Present) 98 occurrences using a 7-day hold time 73 occurrences using a 15-day hold time 57 occurrences using a 30-day hold time 30 occurrences using a 90-day hold time Clearly, gains of this magnitude in just a week’s time are not uncommon for Bitcoin, an asset with numerous instances of large price advances especially when considering its relatively short price history compared to traditional risk assets. Bitcoin Results Slightly Less Bullish In Recent Years While a gain of over 18% in such a brief time period may lead some traders to lean bearish, the data suggests otherwise, with historical average results clearly positive across the board for all holding times from 2011 to the present. Bitcoin gains >= 18% in Seven Consecutive Days with Various Hold Times. 2011 – Present. Because Bitcoin’s early price history experienced arguably outsized gains relative to its more recent history, let’s take a look at average results for the same degree of gains in a week’s time but only examining data for the last five years (6/23/18 to the present). Bitcoin gains >= 18% in Seven Consecutive Days with Various Hold Times. Last Five Years. While once again results are positive across the board, the hypothetical results over more recent data are significantly lower, with the average 90-day return of +25.6% over the past five years a far cry from the +109.4% returns for the same 90-day window over the full price history from 2011 to the present. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Surges 8% And Defies Gravity – Bulls Eye $30K While some traders may argue that the past five years is less representative data due to the occurrence of two major bear markets for Bitcoin and crypto more broadly, Bitcoin has shown positive follow through on average for both time periods across all the hold times we examined. While the past does not predict the future, the recent powerful price advance appears to suggest that Bitcoin is poised for greater gains in relatively near future.

14132839,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=539425,1687561244,"Mask Foundation Moves 2.5 Million Tokens To Exchanges, Huge Dip Incoming?","In the volatile and unpredictable world of cryptocurrencies, major transactions often signal impending market movements. Recently, Lookonchain, an on-chain analytics firm, reported a substantial transfer of MASK tokens, initiated by the Mask Network Foundation. According to their findings, the foundation moved nearly 3 million MASK tokens out of its wallets, an event that could potentially lead to significant market fluctuations. At the time of writing, the token was trading at $3.69, following a decline of over 2.5% over the past 24 hours. The noteworthy shift of 2.5 million MASK tokens, equating to over $9 million, could potentially trigger further price variations. Related Reading: DeFi Liquidity Pool: A Guide to Liquidity Pool Token The intent behind the substantial token transfer remains speculative, prompting varied interpretations within the crypto community. Mask Network Foundation transferred 3M $MASK ($11.25M) out today. Among them, 2.5M $MASK ($9.4M) was transferred to #Binance and #OKX. And 500K $MASK was transferred out 1 hour ago, which may be transferred to #OKX later.https://t.co/mBI4PbZaLa pic.twitter.com/BXQNceMuxs — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 23, 2023 Mask Network Foundation’s Large-scale Transfer According to Lookonchain, the Mask Network Foundation distributed 2.5 million tokens, which are worth more than $9 million, between Binance and OKX. An additional 500,000 tokens were also transferred out of the foundation’s wallets, but they have not yet surfaced on any exchange platform so far. Related Reading: Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Continues To Rise While Market Sees Correction This particular move has led to speculations of an impending sell-off within the next 24-48 hours. Meanwhile, the transfer could signify the Mask Network Foundation’s strategy to bolster market-making activities. By moving a significant number of the tokens to exchange platforms, the foundation could be aiming to stimulate trading volume and attract a wider range of traders to the project. Despite the 2.5% drop in MASK’s value, the move could potentially stabilize the token’s price by fostering liquidity and demand in the market. While it’s too early to definitively predict the impact of these transactions on MASK’s market position, the movements undeniably indicate an upcoming shift in the MASK network token market. MASK’s Latest Price Action The MASK token price has increased in the past 7 days, with the token breaking multiple resistance levels. MASK is currently trading at $3.70, up by nearly 10% over the past week. However, over the past 24 hours, MASK has seen a slight decline down by 2.5%. Though it is not certain if there has been any huge sell-off yet of the tokens transferred to exchanges, the token has plunged from its 24-hour high of $3.84. The token currently has a market capitalization of $302.6 Million, making it rank 107th among the largest cryptocurrency by market cap. MASK’s daily trading volume has also significantly moved in the past 7 days. The token’s volume has surged from as low as $31 million last Friday to as high as $93 million in the past 24 hours.

42410313,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdFRUO,1687559223,Influencer Formerly Associated with Azuki Postpones NFT Drop After Plagiarism Accusations,"When a highly-anticipated non-fungible token (NFT) project seems off, skeptical users will often head to Twitter to voice concerns and attempt to investigate further. The accusations often become more intense and spread quickly when they involve a prominent Web3 influencer.  On the eve of her NFT drop on Wednesday, pseudonymous digital artist and researcher Elena was accused of plagiarizing artistic assets in her collection. Elena, who amassed a following of nearly 90,000, previously described herself as the “researcher in residence” at blue-chip NFT collection Azuki, though that designation has since been wiped from her Twitter page.  On Wednesday, the chief creative at governance protocol creator Phase Labs, who goes by the pseudonym Kemosabe on Twitter, posted a thread claiming that Elena ""stole"" art for her new NFT project Atomic Ordinals. The collection, featuring 200 pixel-art inscriptions on the Ordinals Protocol, was originally set to mint Wednesday on marketplace Magic Eden’s Bitcoin Creator Launchpad.  Kemosabe referenced a series of tweets from artist Nicole Liu, creator of the Bitcoin-based NFT collection Abstract Ordinals, who addressed the similarities between the art, though she said she wasn’t bothered by it.  “I think imitation is a form of flattery,” said Liu in a tweet. “It makes me happy that she liked it so much to use it as inspiration and I don't have a problem with it.”  However, Liu did raise concerns over the quality of the images and the high price tag for the inscriptions.  “I'm sorry to say thisElena but it's unacceptable to charge $1,500 for this,” said Liu.  The threads about Elena’s art quickly spread through the Twittersphere, resurfacing a discussion about how Web3 influencers should not abuse their positions of power to earn a quick buck – a trend that continues to plague the space.  “Time and time again, people amass influence only to cash in on it, when the bag becomes big enough,” wrote Kemosabe.  Soon after, Dem, the pseudonymous head of community at Chiru Labs, the Web3 company behind Azuki, tweeted that Elena was no longer on a contract with Chiru Labs. The team specified that the contract had expired this month and will not be renewed.  The fine line between inspiration and plagiarism  As crypto Twitter buzzed about the alleged scandal, Elena posted a tweet stating she would postpone the Atomic Ordinals drop due to the backlash. In her tweet, she claimed that she had “retraced” some of the source images referenced by other users, an act that while not explicitly illegal is largely frowned upon within the art community.  As news of the situation spread, Elena said that she’d received threats and hate comments in response.  “Today I have received an incredible amount of hate, including numerous death threats in dms, which is disappointing as I’ve always tried to simply give value to the space,” said Elena. “I have heard your concerns about the art and I will be working to fix the file quality and any images that might be seen as ‘copied’ as they were only retraces and I never had any ill intent whatsoever.”  On Thursday evening, Elena posted a longer thread addressing the allegations in further detail, stating that she had used “free-for-commercial-use images to replace 16 of the art[works],” and took accountability for her actions.  “This is a horrible look. There’s no way around it and I deeply regret it and I genuinely apologize to everyone,” said Elena. “These silo-ed images exist so artists can incorporate them into their work which I know made a lot of people upset.” She noted that those 16 images would be removed from the collection.  The power of Web3 influence  The theft of digital artwork to make NFTs remains a serious problem. The problem is often compounded when well-known figures within the Web3 space promote trending projects to their millions of followers without proper due diligence.  In May, Web3 influencer Andrew Wang promoted an NFT collection called Pixel Penguins, a series of pixel art profile pictures (PFPs). Wang tweeted about the project to his nearly 190,000 followers and pledged that profits from the mint would go to the artist to allegedly help with their mounting medical bills.  However, hours after the collection earned the top spot on secondary marketplace OpenSea, the address behind the mint smart contract ran off with the funds and the artist behind the collection deleted their Twitter account. Later, tweets surfaced that pointed to stolen artwork.  While buyers were angry at the artist who rugged them, they were also angry at Wang, a prominent voice on NFT Twitter, for promoting the collection.  The Pixel Penguins rug pull not only sparked conversations around NFT plagiarism, but the power that Web3 influencers hold in impacting their followers’ decisions to mint into collections.  In February, after once-popular NFT project Friendsies rugged its holders by “pausing” its collection and deleting its Twitter, users came after influencers that promoted the collection for their role in its success.  Elena said in a tweet that her Atomic Ordinals would be free to mint in response to the controversy. In the end, the project serves as a reminder to collectors eager to mint into a new digital project to always do their research, regardless of the artist’s reputation.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | TRADING | RESEARCH,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/06/23/influencer-formerly-associated-with-azuki-postpones-nft-drop-after-plagiarism-accusations,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/40c9771ebfb21e729b3ce056daacc9dee7e386ea-1498x1022.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to a press release, the NFT, titled “Empowerment” is a one-of-one token created by World of Women artist Rhi Madeline. It will be available to purchase via auction on marketplace OpenSea from June 26 to June 28.  The artwork is inspired by Spanish soccer player Alexia Putellas, who helped Barcelona win the semi-final match of the Women’s Champion League game against German team Wolfsburg in April 2022. With almost 92,000 viewers watching the game, the NFT pays tribute to the historic victory for the Spanish football team.  ""I’m proud to be part of a club like FC Barcelona, our soccer team and to continue to making history, with this new Masterpiece I have the privilege of being part of and that represents everyone, while also explaining what Barça represents so well,” said Putellas in a press release.  Diana-Luk Ye, Web3 Partnerships and Marketing Manager at World of Women, told CoinDesk that its participation in the Masterpiece collection emphasizes its mission to empower women and non-binary people across the Web3 space and beyond.  “Representation is still an issue that we're trying to fix, and knowing that there's Masterpiece number two, honoring Alexia, there’s all the strength, the resilience, the ambition, all that mindset work that goes into being successful,” said Ye. “It was just a nice extension for us to further support this mission.”  The owner of the Empowerment NFT will also receive a list of FC Barcelona benefits, including an opportunity to meet Putellas and a pair of signed soccer cleats. They’ll also receive a physical chair from Barcelona Stadium Spotify Camp Nou, with a signed portrait of Putellas by artist Oscar Tusquets.

14131239,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=539398,1687557617,"Crypto Analyst Predicts: Bitcoin (BTC) To Reach $69,000 And Above In 2023","As the world of crypto continues to evolve, traders and analysts are closely monitoring the Bitcoin (BTC) charts for clues about future price movements. Among them, the popular analyst known as Credible Crypto has shared his insights, predicting a new all-time high for Bitcoin by 2023. The prognosis relies on the assumption of a continuing “parabolic advance” that could drive the token beyond its previous peak of $69,000. Predicting A Parabolic Advance For Bitcoin The essence of Credible Crypto’s prediction lies in the nature of Bitcoin’s “parabolic advance.” This concept describes a situation where momentum in the price of an asset increases exponentially until it reaches its peak. Related Reading: Nansen Forecast For Bitcoin Bull Run: Regulatory Clarity And Lower Inflation According to Credible Crypto, such advances have been evident in Bitcoin’s history, as observed during its ascents from $3,000 to $14,000 and from $10,000 to $60,000. Bitcoin’s recent performance, characterized by firm support at $25,000 on monthly timeframes, is considered by Credible Crypto as potentially setting the stage for another round of parabolic advance. This new climb, the analyst suggests, should produce monthly moves of more than $10,000, filling the $40,000 gap to the previous all-time high. A ‘Logical’ Guess For New Heights While cautioning that these are estimations based on current market conditions, the trader puts forth October 2023 as a “fairly logical guesstimate” for when Bitcoin could reach its new all-time high. He clarifies that it’s not a definitive prediction, but rather an estimation based on the logic of Bitcoin’s past behavior. The analyst noted: I am not saying we MUST hit new all-time highs by October, I AM saying I do think we will hit new ATH by the end of this year, and if someone forced me to pick a month in which I think this will occur it would be October. Let’s see how things play out. Meanwhile, over the past 7 days, Bitcoin has made significant moves. The asset has shown a huge recovery from its recent bloodbath amid the United States Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit on the two largest crypto exchanges, Binance and Coinbase. Bitcoin has tapped a notable high of above $30,000 bringing the asset to record a nearly 20% gain to its value in the past 7 days. Notably, BTC’s surge comes amid financial giants such as BlackRock embracing the crypto future. BlackRock, which is the world’s largest asset manager, last week disclosed its latest plan to launch a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) if it gets approved by the US regulator, sparking an incredibly rally in the price of BTC. Related Reading: BlackRock Inches Closer To Launching Bitcoin ETF: Potential Impact On BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin currently trades above $30,000 after trading below that price range throughout last week. In the past 7 days, Bitcoin’s total market capitalization has also seen a boost of 18.1%, amounting to an additional $90 billion. The market capitalization of Bitcoin presently hovers at $585.2 billion, an increase from last Friday’s $494 billion.

14131201,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4613353-makerdao-changes-are-coming?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1687557428,MakerDAO: Changes Are Coming,"Summary MakerDAO is the engine that drives the DAI stablecoin. DAI is the largest crypto-collateralized stable in the market. Maker was founded by Rune Christensen in 2015. Christensen recently proposed the Maker ""Endgame."" It's a plan that will radically change the structure of the DAO and create a new token. DAI is increasingly changing from a coin backed by USDC and other stables to a coin backed indirectly by US Treasuries. It has been said by some within the crypto ecosystem that crypto's ""killer app"" is actually stablecoins. Stablecoins are essentially fiat-denominated tokens that live on public blockchain network rails. The two largest stablecoins in the crypto market are Circle's USD Coin ( USDC-USD ) and Tether ( USDT-USD ). There are many ways that stablecoins can be utilized within the crypto ecosystem. When interests rates were zero, market participants could utilize stablecoins for lending and yield generation. Elsewhere, stablecoins are used for payments. As we saw in March when the banking sector was stressed, stablecoins were not immune from counterparty risk in the world of traditional finance. Several stables, including USDC, lost their dollar pegs as collateral backing those stablecoins was held with some of the regional banks that were impacted by depositor outflow problems. However, there are stablecoins in the market that aim to be decentralized and crypto-collateralized rather than fiat-backed. One such coin is DAI ( DAI-USD ). With a $4.7 billion market cap, DAI is the largest crypto-collateralized stablecoin by far. DAI is managed by the MakerDAO ( MKR-USD ) protocol. In this article, we'll dive into the token-economics of MKR, the key metrics concerning DAI, Maker's proposed ""Endgame,"" and highlight some concerns. MKR Tokenomics Maker was launched in 2015 by Rune Christensen. The protocol is the engine that drives DAI. The MKR token plays an important role in the DAI ecosystem. MKR is both the governance token of the protocol and token holders take the fees that are paid by borrowers of DAI. MKR's token supply is just over 1 million coins and those coins are all in circulation according to CoinMarketCap: Total Token Supply: 1,005,577 Circulating Supply: 977,631 (97%) Token Price: $730 Market capitalization: $714 million Circulating Market Cap Rank: 60 Unlike many other coins in the cryptocurrency market, MKR never had an ICO or public token offering. That said, the MakerDAO protocol has received roughly $55 million in venture capital funding through the years from entitles like a16z and Polychain Capital among others. MKR Allocation (CryptoRank) There is a very high level of token concentration with MKR and we'll explore that more in the concerns section. Purely from a supply standpoint, Maker does have a token burn mechanism when a user creates a loan. This means MKR is theoretically a deflationary token that should ultimately move higher in price provided the protocol is generating fees. And therein lies the problem: MKR Fees vs Price (Token Terminal) Over the last year, fees in the Maker protocol have declined by 74%. Though I will admit that fees in June will end at the highest level in the last 12 months. This fee spike is due in part to a recent change to the savings rate of DAI. DAI Collateral & Key Metrics As a concept, I really like DAI. However, in reality, DAI has struggled with truly being censorship resistant. Fiat-backed stablecoins are freezable by the contract owner. This theoretically isn't a problem for stablecoins that are sufficiently decentralized, but DAI has historically been highly reliant on fiat-backed stablecoins like USDC: Maker Collateral (Dune Analytics/steakhouse) As recently as mid-March, over 68% of MakerDAO collateral was held in stablecoins. That figure is now closer to 30%. Over the last several months, there has been a clear shift in prioritizing RWA, or real world assets, as collateral backing. RWA Collateral (Dune Analytics/steakhouse) About $167 million of those assets are held through BlockTower and Huntingdon Valley Bank. However, the largest RWA bucket by far is over $1 billion held in US Treasuries (reflected by MIP65). As I alluded above, June has been a strong month for fees for the Maker protocol. DSR Trend (Makerburn) A big driver of that fee spike has been a recent proposal to raise the ""DAI Savings Rate,"" or DSR, from 1% to 3.49%. As a result of that proposal, funds in DSR have increased from $100.7 million at the start of June to over $173 million as of article submission on June 23rd. The payout funds from the DSR would come from the RWA revenue held as collateral. Centralization Concerns Maker has a whale problem. Despite being one of the largest and most important protocols in all of DeFi, there is very little interest in holding MKR from retail. Just 18 whale addresses hold 57.6% of the MKR in circulation and 88 investor addresses control 27.4%. Holder Concentration (IntoTheBlock) This is problematic because it means an entity that is supposed to be a ""decentralized autonomous organization"" is closer to a centralized entity that it would probably like. Maker is currently experiencing one of the problems that many DAOs experience: participation. Most DAOs in the crypto ecosystem don't have active communities voting on every proposal. I touched on this briefly in a Uniswap ( UNI-USD ) article in mid-June . Only 17% of the MKR is staked in the governance contract. And this is actually down from roughly 22% in April. Basically, MKR holders aren't voting and decisions are being determined by just a few people. The Endgame Plan In May, Rune Christensen proposed the ""5 phases of Endgame"" plan in the MakerDAO forum. It is a long, but interesting read that I will try to briefly summarize before providing my thoughts. Phase 1: Rebrand and new token launch. Phase 2: Launch of 6 ""SubDAO"" entities. Phase 3: AI governance tools Phase 4: Governance participation incentive. Phase 5: New chain launch. Christensen from the post: The new brand, the new websites and the names of the new tokens are being developed by the Accessibility governance process, and will be revealed before Phase 1: Beta Launch. The goal will be to simplify the brand towards the basic stablecoin product and highlight its unique value proposition: The ability to farm tokens of DAOs powered by AI Governance. There is a lot to digest from all of this. I'm not even going to touch on the ""AI"" component but I'm not surprised we're seeing it show up in crypto roadmaps and I'll just leave it at that. It's important to note that even after Phase 5 is theoretically finalized, DAI and MKR will continue to function as currently designed and can be used to redeem the new tokens from Phase 1. In listening to interviews with Christensen through various media outlets, he appears to be concerned with branding and centralization in my view. For me, the launch of ""SubDAO"" groups is a bit of a head-scratcher since the participation in the current DAO structure is already so low. I think incentives for participation, or paying people to vote, is a dangerous avenue to go down and doesn't necessarily prioritize good outcomes over simply creating outcomes. But I think the biggest problem from all of this is that Maker is so dependent on a small amount of people. I suspect shifting the attention of those people so dramatically to another coin, chain, and DAO structure will not be good for Maker long term. Summary Currently, the investment case for MKR is that holders can govern the platform and generate revenue from protocol fees. As I see it, those fees are becoming increasingly linked to yield from US Treasuries. One then would have to wonder why the user can't simply buy the debt direct and keep all of the yield. From where I sit, MakerDAO is at a crossroads and I suspect Rune Christensen knows it. The optics here aren't great, in my opinion. We've seen cryptocurrency projects rebrand in the past. Polygon ( MATIC-USD ) and Elrond/ MultiversX ( EGLD-USD ) are two examples. Despite their rebrands, they kept using the same tokens. In a lot of ways, the MakerDAO Endgame plan feels like a bit of a Hail Mary pass. DeFi worked wonderfully when the US 2-year was at the floor. Times are different now and I think that's why we're seeing MakerDAO proposing and implementing drastic changes. I don't think it's going to end well.",NEUTRAL,ICO | MKR | DAI,BLOCKCHAIN | ICO | MARKET | MKR | DAI,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4613353-makerdao-changes-are-coming?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/14131201.jpeg
42410319,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdFRkv,1687557400,Coinbase Loses Market Share in Ether Staking as Regulatory Pressure Mounts,"Crypto exchange Coinbase has lost market share in the booming ether (ETH) staking business as mounting pressure from U.S. regulators weighs on its staking service.  The exchange’s share in ETH staking slipped to 9.7%, the lowest level since May 2021, according to a Dune analytics chart by digital asset investment product-issuer 21Shares. This is a significant drop from the 13.6% recorded on April 12, when Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade allowed withdrawals for the first time.  The downturn has happened as the demand for ETH staking – locking up tokens to participate in securing the blockchain while earning a passive income on holdings – was soaring. The Shanghai upgrade unleashed a wave of deposits to staking, with inflows outpacing withdrawals by some 3.5 million ETH, worth $7.3 billion at current prices.  Read more: Ethereum’s Shanghai Upgrade Spurs Institutional Investment Into Staking  Coinbase, however, suffered a net outflow of $517 million (272,315 ETH) during the same period, the second-largest amount after rival crypto exchange Kraken.  “A potential reason could be that investors do not want to be exposed to regulatory risk by using Coinbase’s staking services,” Tom Wan, analyst at 21Shares, told CoinDesk in a note.  Kraken was sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) earlier this year and shuttered its staking service for U.S. customers as part of a settlement with the agency.  On June 6, the SEC also filed a lawsuit against Coinbase for violating federal securities laws, including offering unregistered securities to users with its staking service. However, the exchange said it remained committed to keeping its staking service.  Since the lawsuit, Coinbase has withdrawn some 149,300 ETH from Ethereum’s proof–of-stake network, while depositing only 52,992 tokens, blockchain data compiled by 21Shares shows. The $183 million net outflow indicates that users were unstaking tokens and fleeing the exchange.  Coinbase still held its position as the second largest staking service provider, but fast-growing rivals such as Figment, RocketPool and Kiln have been closing the gap, a Dune chart shows.  The exchange takes a 25% commission on user rewards earned by staking, so a decrease in the amount of staked tokens means less revenue.",NEGATIVE,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/06/23/coinbase-loses-market-share-in-ether-staking-as-regulatory-pressure-mounts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/995f695f22ef4f2c21a3fdb5a96311640f2a12d7-1123x632.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

We also explained IREN's beatdown valuation and why investors are essentially buying IREN's cash flow from mining Bitcoin. We provided evidence to support the feasibility of IREN's recently released expansion plans to achieve 9.1 EH/s by early 2024 and 13.6 EH/s thereafter. We also showed why IREN is a fair company at a wonderful price, how it is undervalued now, and why it has up to 660% upside in the long run. We congratulate those who bought IREN below our suggested $2.90 buy price. Introduction In our last coverage , we found that Iris Energy's ( IREN ) investment value proposition lies in its massive expansion guidance. Around that time, IREN guided a 15 EH/s capacity by the end of 2023 when it had only 1.16 EH/s. This is very similar to CLSK's guidance . However, this guidance wasn't appealing to us as the chance of meeting expectations was slim, and we expected IREN to miss expectations: We find this proposition to be not as appealing because there is a big IF. IREN can only provide better upside ONLY IF it can follow through on its target mining capacity... it is more likely that IREN will not achieve this target . Our concerns were proven valid as IREN has failed to meet previous guidance after suffering a series of setbacks. So in this article, we're going to take a look at IREN's current performance, and future expectations, and tie them all together to propose a conservative price target. IREN's Redemption The major setback faced by IREN is the default on its $108mil loan . Due to this event, IREN suffered blows in different aspects of its operations. IREN had to shut down 2 facilities worth 3.6 EH/s in capacity. By referring to Table 1, we can see the impact on IREN's mining capacity. IREN was growing steadily from 0.348 EH/s in 2021Q3 to 3.7 EH/s in 2022Q3 (1-year period). But a quarter later, IREN's capacity decreased to 1 EH/s as a result of the shutdowns. Table 1. IREN's Historical Capacity Over Time QR Capacity (EH/s) 2023Q2 5.6 2023Q1 1.9 2022Q4 1 2022Q3 3.7 2022Q2 1.16 2022Q1 1.1 2021Q4 0.685 2021Q3 0.348 Source: Author, IREN Fortunately, IREN managed to monetize its prepayment and restructured a deal that cleared off its debt and secure an agreement to obtain 5.4 EH/s capacity. Then for the following 3 quarters, IREN worked hard to ramp up expansion to obtain 5.6 EH/s energized + 1 EH/s funded in May 2023. To regain investor confidence, IREN was vocal in its expansion and recovery throughout the recovery. In addition to the monthly updates, IREN issued interim updates in 1 in February, 1 in March, and 3 in April. Moreover, IREN's board of directors also bought back more than $2.5mil worth of shares during this period. Despite IREN's recovery, the default has a long-term impact on IREN's growth trajectory. The decline of IREN's production yield is sticky and will not be solved just because IREN's capacity has recovered. Due to the default, IREN's growth trajectory was set back about 2 quarters. During this period, IREN's competitors have been expanding rapidly (Table 2). As a result, IREN's share in the Bitcoin (BTC-USD) network has declined. Before shutting down IREN's 2 facilities, IREN produced 448 Bitcoins in October 2022 with 3.9 EH/s capacity. But in April 2023, IREN only produced 319 Bitcoins with the same 3.9 EH/s capacity. Unless IREN's expansion rate can outpace competitors, IREN's decline in production yield will be sticky. We explained this rationale when we covered HIVE Blockchain ( HIVE ). Table: Capacity Growth Comparison QR MARA (EH/s) CLSK (EH/s) RIOT (EH/s) IREN (EH/s) 2023Q2 15.2 (20.1 installed) (~400% growth) 6.7 (8.7 installed) (>200% growth) 10.6 (~200% growth) 5.6 (~50% growth) 2023Q1 11.5 (15.4 installed) 6.7 10.5 1.9 2022Q4 7.0 (9.1 installed) 6.2 (8.7 installed) 9.7 1 2022Q3 5.7 EH/s 4.16 5.6 (installed 7.8) 3.7 Source: Author Nevertheless, on 20th June, IREN announced its plans to close the gap by achieving 9.1 EH/s by early 2024 and 13.6 EH/s in the future. Casting its track record aside, we think that this guidance has substance. IREN's total mining cost per Bitcoin (committing occasion spikes) averages around the $40,000 range (Table 3). If depreciation, stock-based payments, and interest expense (no debt) are excluded, the mining cost per Bitcoin averages around $17,000. Hence, IREN is operating cash flow positive since IREN is selling the Bitcoins mined above cash expenses per Bitcoin. Table 3. IREN's Historical Total Mining Cost QR Total Mining Cost ($mil) Bitcoins Mined Total Mining Cost Per Bitcoin 2022Q4 42 722 58,171 2022Q3 27.2 780 34,871 2022Q2 22.479 436 51,557 2022Q1 14.05 357 39,355 2021Q4 14.5 364 39,835 2021Q3 7.578 241 31,443 Source: Author Being operating cash flow positive and without debt, IREN can technically use most of its operating cash flow and cash on hand ( $64mil as of June 2023) for expansion. According to our estimation , $23mil is required to expand 1 EH/s. Using May production levels, IREN's mining operations can generate around $7mil cash flow monthly at $30,000 per Bitcoin (= 508 Bitcoins x [$30,000 - $17,000 cash expense]). So $66mil is sufficient to fund about 3 EH/s while IREN can fund 1 EH/s every quarter (at $30,000 per Bitcoin). Therefore, IREN does have sufficient cash to expand from the current 5.6 EH/s to 9.1 EH/s by early 2024 and 1 EH/s per quarter (at $30,000 per Bitcoin) thereafter to achieve 13.6 EH/s. Therefore, IREN is not a lost cause, despite its previous default on loan. Valuation Our problem with IREN's current operating model is the lack of one of the major drivers of shareholder value (equity). Bitcoin mining companies that have large Bitcoin reserves such as Hut 8 Mining ( HUT ) and Marathon Digital Holdings ( MARA ) enjoy higher shareholder equity and higher profit margins when the Bitcoin price rise. Since IREN does not have Bitcoin holdings, IREN's intrinsic value does not enjoy the same upside as other Bitcoin mining companies. Considering this, since IREN plans to expand to 13.6 EH/s, it is reasonable to assume that most of its cash will be allocated for growth (Property, Plant, and Equipment, PP&E). The problem with this operating model is that it does not sufficiently increase shareholder equity to justify the risk. The downside is highly correlated to Bitcoin's performance because Bitcoin miners go to 0 if Bitcoin goes to 0, yet the upside of IREN is not as correlated to Bitcoin's performance because IREN's equity does not benefit from Bitcoin's price appreciation due to lack of Bitcoin holdings-Moreover, a large amount of cash spent in PP&E which will eventually depreciate away. In simple terms, what IREN shareholders are getting is simply a portion of the cash flow from mining Bitcoin, not the full upside Bitcoin can provide. This can explain why IREN is trading below book value. IREN is currently priced at a $240mil market cap, but its adjusted net asset value (cash + PP&E + deposit - total liability) stands at $265mil (as of 2022Q4). We believe that using 2022Q4 is a conservative measure because we estimate IREN's 2023Q2 adjusted net asset value to be higher thanks to higher PP&E, positive operating cash flow, and no debt. As Warren Buffett said: It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price. Since IREN is trading below book value, we deem IREN as undervalued because shareholders can gain a profit from liquidating IREN today. Furthermore, our model suggests massive upside potential for IREN. As for the upside, assuming IREN's short-term 9.1 EH/s expected capacity, IREN can justify a $600mil market cap and a $1.2bn market cap if Bitcoin trades above $69,000 and $100,000 respectively. This implies a 146% to 410% upside potential, rivaling our high conviction pick, CLSK, after its recent run-up. But when we consider IREN's long-term expected capacity (13.6 EH/s), IREN can justify an $880mil and $1.83bn market cap if Bitcoin trades above $69,000 and $100,000 respectively. This translates to a 270% to 660% upside in the long term, much higher than CLSK. Should IREN generate excess operating cash flow to cover expansion and expansion, IREN further boosts shareholder value by accumulating the Bitcoins mined. This is an upside not accounted for by our models. In short, IREN is very attractive at this valuation. We congratulate those who bought IREN below our $2.90 suggested buy price from our previous coverage. Verdict We can summarize our thesis for IREN this way, investors would be buying a fair company at a wonderful price. Despite the setback from its loan default, IREN bounced back and showed commitment to redeem itself. Even though we think that investors are simply buying IREN's cash flows from mining Bitcoin, these cash flows can justify a rather massive market cap and provide sufficient upside potential to justify the risk. Therefore, we give IREN a buy rating.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4613351-iris-energy-not-a-lost-cause?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/14131068.jpeg

Next week’s macroeconomic calendar is relatively light, with the exception of Friday consumption expenditure data.  Thirty days ago, bitcoin was nearing its first losing month of 2023, but today the asset is hurtling toward its strongest performance since March. Ether is following suit, and still has yet to post a losing month for the year.  Bitcoin and Ether are aligning on direction and momentum.  The CoinDesk Indices Bitcoin Trend Indicator (BTI) now signals that bitcoin has entered a significant uptrend phase, following its 15% increase this week.  Bullish catalysts over the past two weeks have started to thaw the frigid crypto winter. The catalysts include bitcoin and ether’s omission from a list of digital assets mentioned in U.S. Securities and Exchange (SEC) lawsuits against crypto exchange giants Binance and Coinbase, and more recently the spot bitcoin ETF filings by BlackRock, Invesco and WisdomTree. Rising jobless claims, a sign that the U.S. central bank’s hawkish monetary policy is slowing the economy, have also been encouraging.  The Ether Trend Indicator (ETI) is now also flashing an uptrend signal, a step above its prior neutral reading.  Momentum for both assets rose sharply this week with their respective Relative Strength Index (RSI) readings jumping 43% and 46%, respectively since Monday.  Not surprisingly the currency sector led Coindesk Market Index (CMI) sectors.  The CoinDesk Market Index rose 11% this week. As of publishing, the trailing five were BTRST (-13.4%), QNT (-5.9%), BTT (-5.0%), MXC (-1.3%), and LUNC (-0.4%)  Among the five CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) sectors, the currencies sector outperformed, as all 20 assets in the sector were positive.  Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Onyxcoin (XCN), led the way, up 33% and 28% respectively. MINA and XLM were sector laggards, yet still up 8.8% and 9.3% respectively.  The DeFi sector trailed, while still rising 5.8%. Rocketpool (RPL), the third largest asset in the index, weighed on performance, falling 2.6% on the week.  What’s ahead in the upcoming week?  Can crypto prices maintain their momentum? Bitcoin has breached the upper range of its Bollinger Bands on four consecutive days, while its RSI level of 75 indicates that the asset is in overbought territory.  Traders leery of the current rally may view this as an opportunity to take profits. The extent to which BTC is or is not moved on to centralized exchanges will be worth monitoring.  Historically, BTC has tended to move higher, even when accompanied by large RSI figures. Trading volume peaked on Wednesday, and fell the two days following. The trajectory of momentum will be worth monitoring, for clues as to whether recent buying pressure is waning.  Macroeconomic data will be light, with the notable exception of Friday’s Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) report.  While the Consumer Price Index (CPI), gets most of the attention specific to inflation, a quick read through of Federal Reserve Minutes shows that PCE is frequently referenced by Federal Reserve Officials.  The consensus forecast is that PCE increased 0.4% in May. A figure above that could stall recent price increases.

14129671,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=539428,1687554051,Bitcoin Future Hangs In The Balance: What To Expect In The Coming Weeks,"Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization, seems to have entered a phase of consolidation above the $30,000 mark following a notable surge of over 10% on Tuesday. While the price movement has generated a lot of interest among investors, it remains uncertain whether Bitcoin will maintain its upward momentum or experience a pullback in the coming days. Bitcoin Uncertain Trajectory Ben Lilly, a well-known cryptocurrency analyst, and economist, recently shared his thoughts on the current state of Bitcoin’s price action and its potential future trajectory. In a recent analysis, Lilly dubbed the current price movement the “Larry Fink Pump,” referencing the recent announcement by BlackRock’s CEO Larry Fink regarding the company’s increased interest and application for a Bitcoin spot ETF. While the pump has caused some excitement among investors, Lilly notes that several factors could cause the rally to falter. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investor Sentiment Suggests BTC Rally Is Far From Over For one, Bitcoin has already wiped out the remaining high-leverage liquidity to the upside, and the Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) spot seems to have lost its short-lived trend already. Additionally, the fuel meter discussed in a recent Alpha Bites episode by Benjamin Skew of Jarvis Labs LLC has dropped significantly from its pre-pump levels, which could indicate a bearish case for Bitcoin in the short term. Despite these potential bearish factors, Lilly remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s future. He notes that the $24,000 level is still sitting there and could be had if the price breaks the 200-day moving average, which is currently creeping above it. If this happens, he predicts that Bitcoin could drop to $21,000-$22,000. However, Lilly also sees the possibility of an upside scenario for BTC. He notes that low-leverage liquidity sits at $32,000, and he would “love to see it taken out.” Looking at the returns by trading session, he points out that the New York session seems to be leading the way. He notes that when the trend of the New York session ends, there’s a bit of a lag before the price responds to the downside, suggesting that the June options max pain of $25,000 may not happen. Lilly also highlights the recent increase in the whale holding chart, as seen in the chart below, which indicates that large Bitcoin holders, commonly referred to as whales, are once again accumulating the cryptocurrency. This is the first time a trend like this has been observed since mid-January, suggesting that there may have been significant accumulation happening before the recent surge in BTC’s price. Related Reading: Is Chainlink The Most Undervalued Altcoin? It’s Do Or Die For LINK Overall, Lilly concludes that investors should not be quick to fade this Bitcoin rally. While there are potential bearish factors at play, there are also several bullish indicators. Investors should track the data to see if the trend continues and be prepared for potential volatility events in the future. At the time of writing, Bitcoin has maintained a stable price for several days. The cryptocurrency is currently trading at $30,100 and has managed to stay in positive territory, with a slight increase of 0.6% over the past 24 hours.

42410310,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdFRHA,1687552043,Brazilian Central Bank Adds Crypto Exchange Mercado Bitcoin in CBDC Pilot Including Mastercard,"Brazil’s central bank authorized on Thursday the largest local crypto exchange, Mercado Bitcoin, to participate in the pilot of the digital real, the South American country’s central bank digital currency (CBDC).  The consortium led by Mercado Bitcoin counts Mastercard, broker Genial, registrar Cerc and financial software fintech Sinqia as partners, local newspaper Valor reported.  Also on Thursday, the central bank gave its green light to state-owned Brazilian bank Caixa to participate in its CBDC pilot, along with card provider Elo and Microsoft.  Mercado Bitcoin had been left out of the central bank’s choice of 14 participants in late May because the consortium lacked at least one regulated financial or payment institution with direct access to Brazil's national financial network. That changed after Mercado Bitcoin received the payment institution license from the central bank, on 2 June.  “Our participation validates the Central Bank's intention to bring innovation to the financial system with those who have already been working with this technology and not just with the incumbents who have appropriated it,” said Fabricio Tota, director of new business at Mercado Bitcoin, Valor added.  “We are pleased to be part of the consortium selected to join the Real Digital pilot in Brazil. Mastercard continues to engage in a series of partnerships to build trust and compliance in the digital assets ecosystem, while also solving real-world problems,” Walter Pimenta, executive vice president of Products and Engineering at Mastercard Latin America and the Caribbean, told CoinDesk in a statement.  The central bank will begin incorporating participants into the Real Digital Pilot platform in mid-June 2023. According to Glovo, the consortium intends to participate in testing the issuance of the CBDC and treasury bills, and will seek to test technical aspects of the network and the governance model of the distributed ledger technology.  The CBDC is slated to be rolled out by 2024 by the central bank, which sees a digital currency as a way of increasing participation in the financial system.

LEO token’s move today follows a consistent price increase since June 20, after Bitfinex announced a public grant to support the open-source development of Qubes OS in partnership with Tether, USDT stablecoin issuer. LEO Outperforms Top Coins With Recent Action LEO’s value did not only strengthen against the dollar but outperformed the two market forerunners, Bitcoin and Ethereum, in terms of 24-hour price change. At the time of writing, LEO is up 9% against Bitcoin and nearly 8% against Ethereum. The bullish momentum presented in LEO’s price movement suggests a move to conquer the $4 psychological level. Related Reading: Is Chainlink The Most Undervalued Altcoin? It’s Do Or Die For LINK The token’s price stalled at the consolidation channel between $3.51 and $3.6 over the past weeks. But currently, LEO is trading at a low of $3.63 and a high of $3.93. Also, its bull-bear power is neutral, indicating a fierce struggle to prevail between the bears and the bulls as the histogram bars show long green candle stick patterns. Notably, the token has bounced off the 200 Exponential Moving Average, indicating a golden cross, meaning LEO is witnessing an upward trend due to a strong buying interest. It also suggests the bulls are in action to trigger a further uptrend. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has exceeded 78, meaning the asset is leaving the overbought territory. This move indicates that LEO’s price is approaching a swing rejection where it could break its last record high. BitFinex/Tether Grant May Have Influenced LEO’s Price Momentum Qubes OS is a free, open-source security-oriented desktop operating system that touts itself as a reasonably secure OS. It allows users to secure through compartmentalization. And Qubes OS aims to provide security and enhanced privacy through isolation. Bitfinex and Tether’s 100,000 USDT grant highlights went toward the company to support projects that drive the development of secure and decentralized technologies. In a statement, Paolo Ardoino, CTO of Tether and Bitfinex, said the firms recognize that privacy and security are paramount in the digital age. Related Reading: Stacks (STX) Succumbs To Market Correction, Slides By 10% In The Last Day Also, the LEO token’s price move could have gained momentum through the brief market rebound over the last 48 hours. As of yesterday, June 22, LEO closed with a 0.6% price increase when the global crypto market capitalization improved by 3%. Although the market retraced slightly, LEO’s momentum only peaked, suggesting stronger market forces at play.

14126658,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=539395,1687546849,"Bitcoin SOPR Bounces Into Profit Zone, What Does This Mean?","On-chain data shows the Bitcoin Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) has bounced back into the profit zone with the latest rally above $30,000. Bitcoin SOPR Has Successfully Retested 1.0 Support Line According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, investors are now selling their coins at a profit. The “SOPR” is an indicator that tells us whether profit-taking or loss-taking is dominant in the Bitcoin market currently. When the value of this metric is greater than 1.0, it means that the profits being realized by the investors are higher than the losses currently. On the other hand, the values of the indicator under this mark suggest the market as a whole is moving/selling coins at a loss. The SOPR being exactly equal to 1.0 naturally suggests that the average investor is just breaking even on their selling at the moment, as the total amount of profits being harvested in the market is equal to the losses. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin SOPR over the past year: Looks like the value of the metric seems to have shot up in recent days | Source: Glassnode on Twitter Note that the version of the SOPR being used here is the “entity-adjusted” one, meaning that it only takes into account the transactions made between separate entities on the network and not all individual wallets. Related Reading: Bitcoin 30-Day Price Range Foreshadowed The Rally, Here’s How An “entity” here refers to a single address or a collection of addresses that Glassnode has determined to belong to the same investor. As transfers where a holder moves coins to a different wallet of theirs aren’t actually sales at all, they aren’t relevant to the SOPR, and so, removing them from the data makes the indicator more accurate. As you can see in the above graph, the entity-adjusted SOPR has been mostly at values above 1.0 during the last few months, a trend that makes sense as the asset has observed a rally in this period, which is bound to have put investors into notable profits. Back in March, however, the indicator had deviated away from this profit-taking trend, as the Bitcoin price had taken a significant hit. This deviation didn’t last for too long, though, as the metric returned to values above 1.0 as the rally resumed. Historically, the transition line between these two zones, that is, the 1.0 level, has had an interesting relationship with the price. During bearish trends, this line has proved to be a resistance point for the coin, while in bullish trends, it has often acted as support. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Show Most Active Hour In 3 Months As BTC Breaks $30,000 Recently, as Bitcoin had been struggling, the SOPR had observed a slight drop under the 1.0 level again, although the deviation was pretty small when compared to the instance in March. As it has happened many times in the past, it would appear that the 1.0 retest has provided a bounce to BTC this time as well, as the cryptocurrency has rallied towards the $30,000 mark. The Bitcoin SOPR has surged above 1.0 with this rebound, implying that the investors are now once again harvesting a large amount of profits. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $30,100, up 17% in the last week.

42410320,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdFRrX,1687545127,"How Gaming, Loyalty and Entertainment Are Adapting to the Rise of NFTs and Web3","This week, we spoke to experts from across the entertainment, loyalty and gaming sectors about mass adoption. The general consensus? We’re getting closer, though it’ll probably look way more subtle than you think.  Also, global footwear giants Nike and Puma announced new partnerships and digital sneaker releases that offer meaningful utility and thoughtful designs.  You’re reading The Airdrop, our weekly newsletter where we discuss the biggest stories across Web3. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Friday.  This Week's Alpha  Onboarding the next billion users: Experts from across the entertainment, loyalty and gaming sectors made their cases for why their industries are poised to bring about mass adoption of Web3. While the broader crypto market is down and experiencing numerous challenges, the sentiment around Web3 and a decentralized, creator-focused digital future remains positive.  Entertainment as a “stealthy” tool: Visual media like TV and movies have the potential to onboard mass consumers in a gradual and fluid way, according to executives in the entertainment industry. “Mainstream adoption will probably look less like a conscious choice and will just happen to be powered by this technology,” Chris Jacquemin, says head of digital strategy at global talent agency WME.  NFT memberships and supercharging fandom: Thanks to NFTs, artists are able control how their tickets are distributed and reward their fans for engagement, experts in the ticketing and loyalty field say. “Any artist who is minting their own NFTs can explore token-gated sales, which can be used to help match token holders with premier seats, pre-show experiences or to simply give first access to all tickets on an upcoming tour,” said David Marcus, EVP of music at Ticketmaster.  Gaming that provides “true ownership” of assets: Gamers around the world are spending billions of dollars each year on in-game assets – without actually owning those assets, according to gaming industry leaders. NFTs allow players to buy, sell and trade those assets, giving them value inside and outside of the game. “It's about just getting something back for what you put into it, in terms of possessing some sort of interoperable utility,” said Spencer Tucker, chief gaming officer at Yuga Labs.  Fancy footwork: Major sneaker companies have continued to team up with both Web2 and Web3 brands to bring digital collectibles to their millions of fans. Their collaborations offer meaningful utility and thoughtfully designed digital items that prove Web3 doesn’t have to feel forced or clunky for global brands.  Battle Royale: Nike continued its digital expansion with a new partnership, bringing its .SWOOSH experience to Fortnite’s 240 million users. ""Airphoria,"" a collaboration between Nike, Fortnite creator Epic Games and branded game builder Beyond Creative, will enable players to opt-in to connecting their digital items across the Fortnite and .SWOOSH ecosystems. “This is all part of a larger effort to bring Nike's Air Max brand into the world of Fortnite with cosmetics, Fortnite islands, and account linking between Nike and Epic,” an Epic Games spokesperson told CoinDesk.  Cat’s meow: Global sneaker brand Puma released a new pair of sneakers called the “GutterMelo MB.03” that link real-world kicks to NFTs. The colorful drop is a collaboration between Puma, Web3 streetwear brand Gutter Cat Gang and NBA player LaMelo Ball.  Projects on the Rise  Mfers  Who: Pseudonymous NFT collector and artist Sartoshi  What: Mfers, an NFT collection of hand drawings released in 2021, received a boost in both sales and volume this week, according to OpenSea. It’s not entirely clear why the collection was trending, though a recent product release by home improvement giant Lowe’s that featured two characters from the open-source collection gained some buzz. The collection offers no utility and no roadmap and was inspired by the “Are ya winning, son?” meme.  How: The project operates under a CC0 license, which means that the project is in the public domain and can be used in any way by anyone. In June 2022, Sartoshi transferred the project’s smart contract and ownership to the community. The simplistic collection has gained a major following online, and individual NFTs often sell for over $1,000 – far higher than their original mint price of 0.069 ETH, or about $320. So far, the collection has done 66,510 ETH in sales, or nearly $125 million. Mfers can be purchased on secondary marketplaces like OpenSea.  In Other News  Mint Into a SlimJim: The jerky company invited fans to join their new “Meataverse” and is giving away 10,000 “GigaJims"" NFTs.  Magical Elixir: Web3 gaming distribution company Elixir Games announced a strategic partnership with game retailer GameStop to power the infrastructure for GameStop’s new Playr platform.  The Legend of Zora: The NFT creation platform popular with brands and creatives has launched its own layer 2 blockchain network.  Hund hunt: Germany’s intelligence agency released a dog-themed NFT collection to recruit new talent that included a hidden string of blockchain characters.  Non-fungible Faroe Islands: The autonomous territory has issued new physical stamps linked to NFTs.  Non-Fungible Toolkit  Everything You Need to Know About Bitcoin ETFs  A bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) tracks the value of bitcoin and allows investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency without actually owning any.

14125193,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=539397,1687543259,"MATIC Price Recovery Hits Roadblock, When Will Bulls Break Through?","The MATIC price recovery has faced a hurdle in recent trading sessions, despite its impressive rebound after surpassing the $0.50 level. Although the altcoin experienced a notable 18% appreciation on the weekly chart, it lost 3% of its market value within the past 24 hours. The overall sentiment remains bearish as demand and accumulation for MATIC have remained low. While buying strength attempted to recover, it has not fully aligned with investor expectations. To reignite demand in the market, the altcoin must overcome immediate resistance levels. Surpassing these resistance levels will be key for the altcoin to rally and overcome significant barriers. The decline in MATIC market capitalization indicates a decrease in buying strength. Related Reading: Breaking Through This Ceiling Will Propel XRP By Another 12% MATIC Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, MATIC was valued at $0.66. The coin faced resistance at $0.68, but surpassing this level could potentially drive the price toward $0.73. With further potential MATIC may reach $0.77. However, breaching the $0.73 resistance is expected to be challenging for MATIC. Conversely, if buyers fail to emerge in the upcoming trading sessions, the coin may continue to decline. MATIC may move towards its local support level of $0.59, and with a further push downward, the altcoin may trade near $0.57. The recent session’s trading volume for MATIC also decreased, indicating that sellers had control over the price. This joins in to paint a very bearish outlook for the coin. Technical Analysis Despite a slight recovery in buying strength, the altcoin’s uptick may not be sustained unless it moves above the $0.68 level. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) experienced a marginal increase but remained below the half-line, indicating a prevailing dominance of selling pressure. Additionally, the asset’s price fell below the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line, reflecting weak demand and suggesting that sellers are currently driving the market’s price momentum. Positive signs are, however, emerging for MATIC on its daily chart, indicating a potential bullish trend. The formation of buy signals suggests an increase in buying interest, but for this trend to be sustained, continued growth in demand is necessary. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), which tracks price momentum and reversals, has shown green histograms tied to buy signals on the chart. However, the Chaikin Money Flow indicator remains below the half-line, indicating a lower inflow of capital compared to the outflow. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investor Sentiment Suggests BTC Rally Is Far From Over With consistent growth in demand though, even if by slow buildup, the altcoin has the potential to overcome immediate hurdles and achieve further gains.

This once again raises the question of whether centralization, with its concentration of power, is the ideal path forward or if decentralized projects like Tradecurve are essential for the survival of the DeFi ecosystem. >>BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW No explanation for $4.1 million freeze of USDT On June 19th, Tether froze $4.11 million of USDT without providing any further comment on the action. The analytics platform Etherscan marks the USDT wallet as frozen. A Reddit user traced the frozen account back to a Huobi user, and on-chain data indicates that the USDT was funneled into the wallet in March 2023. There is ongoing speculation that the owner of the account may be involved in illegal activities, which appears to have prompted Tether to actively freeze the holdings in the address. Tether Holdings Limited acts as a centralized entity and manages over $83.1 billion worth of USDT in circulating supply. Each USDT token on any blockchain is issued and backed 1:1 with cash or cash equivalents. Tether and USDT play an essential role in the cryptocurrency market but face concerns regarding centralization, which are further highlighted by the issuer's ability to freeze assets. This stands in contrast to the core principles of blockchain technology, which is inherently borderless and decentralized. Critics on social media are raising their voices, pointing out that Tether Holdings Limited behaves like a bank by freezing the address. A Reddit user highlighted the fact that Tether has integrated a ""kill switch"" in the token's code that can potentially be triggered at any point to block an address. This carries a certain risk for the overall market and the financial system. As the cryptocurrency industry continues to expand and evolve, it remains to be seen to what extent USDT can achieve decentralization in its final state. On the other hand, Tradecurve aims to revolutionize the trading industry by offering a decentralized hybrid exchange. Tradecurve.io: Decentralized trading Tradecurve represents the next step in decentralized trading. By combining the worlds of decentralized and centralized exchanges, it provides access to thousands of financial instruments across multiple international markets. Users can leverage their cryptocurrency to trade commodities, stocks, forex, cryptocurrencies, and more.

Tradecurve offers various advantages, such as AI-driven algorithmic trading, 500:1 leverage, a VIP account service for whales, copy trading, and a Metaverse Trading Academy, which provides all the necessary materials for self-education.

14124357,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/06/the-future-is-now-film-premieres-saving-the-future-eyes-on-africa,1687541400,The Future is Now Film Premieres “Saving The Future: Eye on Africa”,"‘The Future is Now Film’ has been enlightening its audience over the past 5 years showcasing the amazing feats that blockchain technology has endured and overcome. Even in such a short time, it’s now clear just how revolutionary cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology have come out to be. Starting in the 1990’s with the internet of information, slowly moving into the Internet of Things throughout the early 2010’s, we’re now witnessing the era of the Internet of Value. This is a concept that is not only unique, with everyone having access to a growing digital market, but also one that offers a fair chance to create and store money in ways never before seen. In many countries that didn’t have access to a central banking system, let alone broadband due to corruption and other factors, we are now seeing communities prosper thanks to the introduction of crypto banking systems and blockchain technology integrated within their infrastructure. Africa and the Future of Crypto Probably one of the most prevalent examples of blockchain being successfully integrated into a region’s infrastructure would relate to Sandi Bitenc – an individual at the forefront of change within Africa. Sandi is the founder of 3air, a telecom and blockchain company whose mission is to give access to the internet even to the most underserved communities. In Sierra Leone, 3air has already built two base stations capable of serving around 90% of the city, finally enabling access to broadband for thousands of people. 3air also provides the use of its cryptocurrency token as a means to pay and get paid for redistributing its unique broadband connectivity within its ecosystem, allowing people in Sierra Leone to embark further in crypto mass adoption. Africa is the largest adopter of cryptocurrency, largely thanks to the underlying need for such a technology. Many banks throughout Africa simply didn’t have the structure or resources to hold dollar reserves, the typical international currency for trade, meaning it was a useless tender when trading as most citizens just didn’t have access to it. Nearly all countries hold their reserves in foreign banks which are subject to laws out of their control. We have seen Africa torn apart for centuries with natural resources being drained, purposely being deprived of basic educational and technological needs which could have easily been shared, drastically improving the quality of life. Let's take a look at some of the innovators who are already injecting this technology into Africa and beyond. TheFutureIsNowFIlm – Queen Diambi Queen Diambi of the Bakwa Luntu tribe of Central Kasaï in the historic Kingdom of Luba (Congo) is making headlines with Africa and their adoption of cryptocurrency. She is travelling the world and spreading the word in the pursuit of making Africa great again. Queen Diambi is driven by the goal of bringing African technology and sciences to the level that they once were in the distant past, where the African nation was much more advanced than traditional history books would deem to say. TheFutureIsNowFilm – Revoland Game Already making waves in both the educational and financial sectors, Jimmy Zhao first introduced Revoland to Africa as a growing market. ChainXGame was responsible for teaching users in Ethiopia about gaming but under a Play-2-Earn model. This meant that individuals were able to earn crypto while playing and learning the fundamentals about GameFi as a future means for their economic well being, let’s remember the Axie Infinity and the Philippines use case. Cultivating this kind of access for Africans is fundamental in moving into a fairer financial community where everyone can create value, together. TheFutureIsNowFilm – Ikigai Ventures Ikigai Ventures are all about supporting companies who can benefit all of us – companies who are striving for positive social change and a good ESG strategy. As Eman Pulis puts it, if you love what you do and it rewards you well, while being great for society, you have found your ikigai, a Japanese word that cannot be translated to English. Through AIBC Summit which also belongs to Eman, the man who once named himself “Just an events guy” to now a full fledged Web3 start up fund, has now created access to incredible deal flow in the industry. TheFutureIsNowFilm – Oz Living Devoted to financial freedom, Oz Living is providing services for individuals and their families to gain full control over their assets while also helping them reduce taxes. Their mission being a world where people live life on their own terms. The Oz eco-zone is currently being pioneered with the permission of the Philippines Government that is allowing Jin Gonzalez, the founder, to create a portable and tax-free zone for its citizens who wish to relocate, gain citizenship and experience living in the world of Oz. TheFutureIsNowFilm – Acta Finance Acta Finance ecosystem is looking to combine new and already existing centralised passive-earning principles and bring them on-chain. Christof Waton considers this really a great example of out with the old and in with the new as the company rewards their growing ecosystem creating a cross-platform and friendly community for all to experience the power of DeFi. Web3 Shareholders Web3 revolutionises the way we interact with the internet. Web2, the current incarnation of our internet, and its websites are typically controlled via a central entity meaning, the company that owns that site decides where one’s data is stored, what they can actively do with your data while also taking responsibility for preventing data breaches and hacks. In Web3, every user is a shareholder building communities, not businesses. The Internet of Value works towards educating and rewarding those who wish to build the foundations for the new digital world. People are tired of a broken system that shows failure every other decade as seen with the most recent USD inflation rates. Africa is by far the largest adopter of crypto and is a leading example of how to start implementing the use of blockchain technology into a countries ecosystem while Dubai is the world leader in education on the blockchain as well as a host to many prestigious events in the field focusing on the MENA region’s development and beyond. AIBC Summit Eurasia The private screening and film premiere was held at AIBC Summit Eurasia in Dubai March 2023 at the Awards Gala Dinner organised by Eman Pulis and SiGMA Group. The film starred Queen Diambi of Congo, Nick Spanos from ""Banking on Bitcoin'', Ivan on Tech, Eman Pulis from SiGMA & Ikigai Ventures, Sandi Bitenc of 3air, Jin Gonzalez of Oz Living, Christof Waton of ACTA Finance, Jimmy Zhao of Revoland and even a cameo of Akon, the world renowned celebrity singer and artist who is also creating Web3 ripples in Africa with his Akoin Foundation. The Gala Dinner and Awards show has become an industry staple since the inception of AIBC back in Malta 2018, then known as the Malta Blockchain Summit, bringing together professionals from all continents. The AIBC Gala in its 5 year history has awarded prominent decentralised futurists like Roger Ver, Brock Pierce & Bobby Lee to name a few. Having #TheFutureisNowFilm premiere at this event in its 2023 reiteration marked The Future is Now DAO's full move and relocation to Dubai as well as a chance for the crème de la crème community of Web3 to get acquainted with this film series which has been covering Bitcoin's disruption across the world. As a matter of fact the 5th episode of TFINFILM, which is the film’s Twitter handle, was the first AIBC Summit in 2018 established by Eman Pulis & SiGMA Group, which back then was branded as the Malta Blockchain Summit and held in Portomaso, Malta. That episode features the late John McAfee, the founder of McAfee anti-virus and the scandalous yet powerful figure in the world of decentralisation. Miguel Francis-Santiago, the film's creator & host, also the Founder of TFIN DAO, confirmed that its time for the platform to go global and has secured a partnership with a 30 year VP of Distribution veteran from Hollywood who has led distribution in giants like Vivendi Universal, Paramount & Hulu. Francis-Santiago believes this partnership is key to having 'The Future is Now Film' finally take on platforms like Netflix & Amazon Prime. Final Thoughts It’s time to get excited about Web3 and the blockchain. Users finally have the opportunity not just to build their own future but contribute to the future being built around them. This trend is becoming even more apparent as we begin to observe the social shift away from centralization and more into the world of a decentralised and equally balanced networks of value creation and knowledge.

Exactly a week ago, crypto giant Binance added the cryptocurrency to the Metaverse and Gaming sections on its exchange. After a slow start, the price of FLOKI seems to be finally leveraging the positive sentiment surrounding it. FLOKI Surges 26% In 7 Days – Price Action FLOKI has registered a significant 25.9% price rise in the past seven days, having broken out of the consolidation zone earlier this week. The price of Floki Inu started moving sideways after falling almost vertically on June 10, losing more than 20% of its value in a single day.

This indicates that a bullish run is still uncertain. As of this writing, Floki Inu changes hands for $0.00002687, with a 24-hour trading volume of more than $78.4 million. According to data from CoinGecko, the coin is currently 52% away from its 2023 high reached on February 17. FLOKI INU Shares 2023 Roadmap Update On June 22, 2023, Floki Inu’s official Twitter account released a tweet giving an update on the ecosystem’s 2023 roadmap. It is a summary of some of the projects their developers have in the pipeline. The first item on the roadmap update is a major upgrade for the FlokiFi Locker, a protocol for securing digital assets, such as Liquidity Pool (LP) tokens, NFTs, and fungible assets. This advancement, which is being touted as FlokiFi’s biggest upgrade yet, will integrate native payments, burn mechanisms, a referral program, and other functionalities. Source: Floki Inu Furthermore, the tweet mentioned a “major DeFi lending and borrowing integration”, which will allow users to collateralize their FLOKI tokens to borrow other cryptocurrencies from “the biggest lending protocol on the BNB chain”. Meanwhile, a staking program is being tested at the moment and will launch as soon as internal checks are over. Related Reading: PEPE Leapfrogs With 72% Rally – What’s Behind The Surprise Vigor?

Year to date, bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), the world's biggest crypto by market cap, has climbed 86%, but, it's still less than half its all-time high of almost $69K reached in November 2021.

42410318,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdFRhc,1687538764,Home Improvement Giant Lowe's Is Selling an Mfers Meme NFT Garden Flag,"Want to rep your degen status to your neighbors? Here's your chance.  Home improvement giant Lowe's this week released a physical garden flag featuring characters from mfers, a popular non-fungible token (NFT) project that exists in the public domain under a Creative Commons classification known as a CC0 license. Under this designation, anyone can use mfers NFT characters to create any type of commercial good, which is exactly what Stephen Thompson and his brother-in-law Matthew Varnell did.  ""This is the PFP [profile picture] project if you ever wanted to do anything fun,"" Thompson, a lawyer by trade, told CoinDesk.  The two men recently started a company called Total Marketing Web3, or TM3 for short, as an umbrella company to oversee different projects that will combine NFT lore and real-world commercial products.  Their first product called the ""Evergreen Siezenals"" garden flag is 1 foot wide by 1.5 feet high and features the phrase ""cc0 summer 2023"" above an image of two NFT characters sipping tropical drinks on the beach. The flag, referred to as ""seizen #1/edition #1"" in the website description, retails for $39.98. According to Thompson and Varnell's website, there will only be 1,000 available, with each flag linked to a replica NFT redeemable online.  Using imagery from the mfers project to create this fun-but-frivolous product makes sense when you consider the collection's origin story that has been enshrined in meme culture. Mfers was created in 2021 by a pseudonymous artist named Sartoshi, who designed the low-fidelity, hand-drawn characters inspired by the “Are ya winning, son?"" meme.  Despite offering no utility and no roadmap, the project has managed to cultivate a strong and passionate collector base. In June 2022, Sartoshi transferred the project’s smart contract and ownership to the community, creating even more fanfare and interest in the collection. Today, these NFTs often sell for over $1,000 each – far higher than their original mint price of 0.069 ETH, or about $320 – and the project has done over 66,510 ETH in sales, or nearly $125 million, according to OpenSea.  Inspired by mfers rise to fame, Thompson and Varnell were able to bring their grassroots project to life with a bit of luck and by calling on existing connections. Varnell works as a manufacturer's rep and as a liaison between companies with products they want to sell and buyers at big-box retailers. This relationship allowed them to get the flags made through a manufacturer called Evergreen, which had an existing relationship with Lowe's.  ""The Web2 industry, as far as our experiences goes, is very curious and eager to tap into what is happening here in Web3,"" he explained.  He added that selling a product that nods to Web3 at a major retailer like Lowe's helps build brand loyalty among younger consumers who are eager to see their digital identities reflected in the real world.  ""People that are into crypto and who are trading NFTs are often under 30 or 40,"" he said. ""They may also have discretionary income and are looking to buy or furnish their first houses.""  The reception to the project has been overwhelmingly positive, according to the unanimous five-star reviews of the flag on the Lowe's website.  ""I don’t know what to say, there are flags, then there’s this. A league of its own,"" wrote one user.  ""Our garden was missing something, we felt empty inside until we found the cc0 Summer 2023 garden flag from mfers at Lowe’s,"" another wrote. ""Our garden is now complete and has been restored to its majestic glory.""  ""The entire NFT community is very supportive,"" Thompson joked.  In the future, Thompson said TM3 is working to expand its offerings, including working with other CC0 NFT projects and creating a variety of seasonal goods. He hopes the project serves as a signifier to larger retail brands that NFTs can be used to transform traditional marketing strategies and create a more symbiotic relationship between manufacturers, retailers and consumers.  ""We think we can redefine the supply chain. Traditionally, the manufacturer and the retailer exclusively shared the burden of marketing,"" he said. ""With Web3, the consumer starts to act as a marketer. We have a vested interest in the brand.""  ""If it's successful, this is a project that everybody can point to,"" he concluded. ""This is the type of marketing and exposure and goodwill that they're trying very hard to build, and we're giving it to them for free.""",POSITIVE,ETH,ETH | TRADING,Rosie Perper,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/06/23/home-improvement-giant-lowes-is-selling-an-mfers-meme-nft-garden-flag,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4ad8d28f07d951f17ed171c91a378a1f9cca6f61-3799x2532.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

14122927,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=539453,1687537817,"Bitcoin Unstoppable Rise: Price Breaks Through $31,000 Setting New Annual High","Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency in the market, is continuing its unstoppable uptrend. After consolidating for a short period between $29,900 and $30,300, BTC has marked a new annual high and breached the $31,000 mark, which it had not surpassed since June 2022. As of this writing, the leading cryptocurrency in the market is trading at $31,300, representing a surge of over 4% in the last 24 hours. Related Reading: Ethereum Bullsh Signal: Supply On Exchanges Continues To Hit New All-Time Lows This recent price increase is a positive development for Bitcoin, demonstrating the resilience and potential for continued growth and adoption in the cryptocurrency market. The consolidation period that preceded this new high indicates that investors were likely accumulating BTC in anticipation of a breakout. Could Bitcoin Reach $35,000 Soon? There’s good news for Bitcoin bulls, as the cryptocurrency has broken its nearest resistance level at $31,000 and aims to reach $31,500. If Bitcoin can break this last bear threshold, the road to $35,000 may be served on a silver platter for the bulls. Additionally, the recent news of Blackrock’s Bitcoin spot ETF and major Wall Street giants expressing interest in investing in Bitcoin may further fuel investor sentiment and propel Bitcoin’s bull run. However, Bitcoin must hold its current price level to prevent this price action from being just a short squeeze followed by a further pullback. If the current price level is sustained, it could provide a solid foundation for continued growth and upward momentum. As the chart above indicates, Bitcoin’s ADX (Average Directional Index) is currently peaking upwards, signifying the current trend’s strength. The ADX is a technical indicator commonly used to quantify the strength of a trend in the financial markets. The ADX calculation is based on a moving average of the price range expansion over a given period. It measures the degree to which a market is trending, and it provides traders with a way to identify the strength of a trend and determine whether it is worth trading. When the ADX rises, the trend gains strength, while a falling ADX indicates that the trend is losing momentum. A high ADX reading suggests a strong trend is in place, while a low ADX reading suggests that the market is in a range-bound or choppy state. Related Reading: Stacks (STX) Succumbs To Market Correction, Slides By 10% In The Last Day Bitcoin’s ongoing uptrend shows no signs of slowing down, and the cryptocurrency is gaining momentum, causing concern for bears. However, the influx of new investors entering the BTC market may increase its volatility, posing the risk of liquidating late long positions that could impede Bitcoin’s bullish movement. Overall, Bitcoin’s recent performance is a trend to watch in the coming weeks and months, as it will likely have a significant impact on the broader cryptocurrency market and may attract increased attention from investors, regulators, and the public.

14123067,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/06/imf-still-pushing-cbdcs-while-continuing-to-highlight-crypto-risk,1687537800,IMF still pushing CBDCs while continuing to highlight crypto risk,"A recent IMF post was extremely favourable towards countries in Latin America and the Caribbean using central bank digital currencies, while denigrating El Salvador’s adoption of Bitcoin. The post by the International Monetary Fund suggested that Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries were making “significant strides in the introduction of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). It cited the four Latin American countries of Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, and Ecuador, as ranking among the top 20 countries in 2022 for adoption of crypto assets. However, the IMF post chose to go along with the perceived disadvantages of these potential adoptions citing: “crypto asset adoption also presents numerous challenges and risks, particularly for vulnerable LAC countries with a history of macroeconomic instability, low institutional credibility, substantial capital flows, corruption, and extensive informal sectors.” On the subject of adoption, the IMF authors pointed out how the Dominican Republic and Argentina had prohibited the use of crypto assets, citing the concerns of “financial stability, currency and asset substitution, tax evasion, corruption and money laundering”. It was not mentioned that the IMF itself had obliged the Argentinian central bank to insert an anti-crypto clause in its agreement over a recent IMF bailout. The IMF said that it had carried out a survey of government officials in the LAC region and half of them had replied that they were considering retail and wholesale CBDC options. “Most survey participants viewed CBDCs as a means to enhance their payment systems and broaden their access. They deemed financial inclusion and monetary sovereignty as crucial factors in favor of retail CBDC issuance by facilitating the integration of unbanked individuals and curbing currency substitution towards stablecoins or crypto assets.” However, the IMF admitted that CBDC takeup was “slow” for the ECCU and the Bahamas, and stated that it was for this reason that these countries must promote CBDC adoption and raise public awareness of them. Opinion The IMF has a profound belief in fiat currencies, and the dollar in particular. It has spent the last several decades of its existence providing loans to primarily third world countries, thereby enslaving them in yet more debt. For such an organisation crypto assets are anathema, to be prohibited and repressed at any cost, despite acknowledging the obvious advantages that the crypto industry has brought to finance. That El Salvador might be having success with its bitcoin adoption strategy must be making officials at the IMF wring their hands with worry. Should the IMF be successful in urging some of these countries in the LAC region to adopt CBDCs then it can be expected that their citizens will be utterly controlled and enslaved. Hopefully citizens will have the education to reject a CBDC, just as is the case in Nigeria, where only 0.5% of the population are using the eNaira as a transaction option, even in the face of cash shortages.

42410315,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdFRb0,1687537459,"Bitcoin Hits One-Year High, Soars Past $31.3K","Bitcoin continued its mid-June surge Friday morning (ET), soaring to a one-year high above $31,000, before retreating below this threshold later in the day.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at $30,894, up about 2.1% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk Indices. It is up roughly 20% over the past week.  BTC last changed hands over $31,050 in June 2022. It crossed $31,000 briefly on April 10.  Bitcoin began spurting earlier this week, a few days after BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, applied for a spot ETF, and as two other financial services powerhouses, Invesco and WisdomTree, refiled their applications for similar products.  Investors who were shaken earlier this month by Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuits against crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase, were heartened by the ETF filings that underscored the ongoing commitment of large institutional investors to enlarge their presence in the digital asset space.  ""A sustained move above USD $31,000 would signal us entering a new phase where market participants are starting to reprice some of the previous regulatory anxiety,"" Strahinja Savic, head of data and analytics at Toronto-based crypto platform FRNT Financial, wrote in a Telegram note. ""Despite what comes across as antagonistic rhetoric from some regulators, the bitcoin spot ETF applications have amplified the view that institutions remain interested in crypto.""  Savic added: ""Despite regulatory complexity, there are serious actors looking at growing their involvement in the digital asset space, and bitcoin’s move above USD 30,000 seems to be acknowledging that.""  In its weekly newsletter on Friday, K33 Research noted similarly that ""Blackrock's Bitcoin spot ETF filing has raised expectations of an institutionally driven price rally being on the horizon.""  Most other major cryptos joined bitcoin's upswing. Ether, the second largest crypto in market value, was recently up 0.5% from Thursday, same time, to change hands at $1,901. Earlier this week, ETH regained the $1,900 threshold for the first time since early June. Litecoin and DOT, the token of smart contracts platform Polkadot, were recently up more than 5% and 6%, respectively. AVAX, the native crypto of the Avalanche blockchain, rose nearly 4%.  The CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of crypto markets performance, recently jumped more than 2%.  Cryptos continued their decoupling ways from equity markets, which sagged on Friday and suffered their first losing week after more than a month of gains. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) declined 0.9%, 0.6% and 0.5%, amid investor concerns about additional interest rate hikes later in 2023 and the prospect of a global recession.  Earlier in the week, the Bank of England raised its rate a hawkish 50 basis points (bps) in its ongoing effort to tame inflation, which remains a stubbornly high 8.7% in the U.K. The U.S. Federal Reserve and other central bank have taken more dovish turns in recent weeks, although Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other bank officials have reiterated their intent to resume rate increases, which have tended to weigh heavily on digital assets.  In a text message to CoinDesk, Mark Connors, head of research at Canadian digital asset manager 3iQ, struck a cautiously optimistic note about the potential, long-term impact of the ETF applications.  ""Sentiment has clearly shifted in the digital space, as markets look through the Binance and SEC complaints, instead, betting the slew of BTC ETF filings drives future demand….sooner than later,"" Connors wrote.  Connors wrote that BTC's ""punch through $31K"" to a year-long high underscored cryptos' exit from ""2022's fire swamp that burned many,"" but that BlackRock and the other firms' ETF initiatives would not drive ""a sustained bid for BTC.""  ""Mounting cross currents that limit near term visibility, not the least is the entrenched battle by the SEC against the digital asset universe of players and protocols,"" Connors wrote, reiterating a theory that BlackRock timed its filing on June 8, just two days after the SEC complaint against Coinbase, ""to support their partner in a strategic effort.""  BlackRock named Coinbase (COIN) as custodian of assets – primarily bitcoin – in the proposed ETF, called the iShares Bitcoin Trust.

The founder of crypto enterprise FTX – who now faces criminal charges from U.S. prosecutors over the dramatic collapse of the exchange while it undergoes separate bankruptcy procedures in Delaware – argued in a May court filing that he'd relied on advice from the Silicon Valley law firm ""on many of the issues that are now at the core"" of the U.S. government's allegations against him. Bankman-Fried cited the opening of a North Dimension bank account and the use of auto-deleting Signal messages as examples of the legal advice he'd heeded.  Bankman-Fried sought to compel U.S. prosecutors to hand over documents given to the government by the law firm, or failing that, seek a court order to subpoena Fenwick & West LLP for the same documents.  New York District Court Judge Lewis A. Kaplan on Friday denied Bankman-Fried's request saying neither Fenwick & West nor the FTX Debtors are part of the “prosecution team.” The government ""has no obligation to produce materials that are not within its possession, custody, or control,"" the order added.  ""Furthermore, the defendant’s proposed subpoena, if enforced, would serve as a fishing expedition and does not meet the specificity, relevance, and admissibility requirements,"" set by precedents such as the 1974 U.S. case against former President Richard Nixon, which famously decided a president cannot shield himself from producing evidence in a criminal prosecution because of executive privilege.  Fenwick & West has sought legal help from Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher to face scrutiny over its relationship with FTX, Reuters reported Wednesday.  Bankman-Fried's criminal trial is set to begin later this year.

Ethereum Supply On Exchanges Has Gone Down Recently According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, supply has continued to leave exchanges recently. The relevant indicator here is the “supply on exchanges,” which measures the total percentage of the Ethereum supply that’s sitting in the wallets of all centralized exchanges. When the value of this metric increases, it means that a net number of coins is entering the supply of these platforms. As one of the main reasons why investors might want to deposit their ETH to the exchanges is for selling-related purposes, this kind of trend can have a bearish effect on the asset’s value. On the other hand, decreasing values of the indicator imply the holders are withdrawing their coins from these platforms right now. Such a trend, when prolonged, may be a hint that the investors are accumulating currently, and hence, can be bullish for the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Bitcoin 30-Day Price Range Foreshadowed The Rally, Here’s How Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Ethereum supply on exchanges over the last few months: The value of the metric seems to have been going down in recent days | Source: Santiment on Twitter As displayed in the above graph, the Ethereum supply on exchanges has been in a downtrend during the last few weeks, implying that investors have been constantly taking out their coins from these platforms. When these withdrawals started, the indicator had reached what was essentially an all-time low (the only time the metric’s value was lower was way back during the first week of the asset going live for public trading). As the holders have continued to transfer their ETH out of the exchanges, new all-time lows in the metric have continued to be hit. Interestingly, even after the latest sharp rally in the Ethereum price has occurred, the metric hasn’t deviated from its downward trajectory. Usually, during rapid increases in the asset’s value, the supply on exchanges tends to go up as some investors look to take advantage of the profit-taking opportunity. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Show Most Active Hour In 3 Months As BTC Breaks $30,000 Since the indicator has only continued to go down further recently, it’s possible that even if there is some selling going on, there is also enough buying going to make up for it. In the chart, Santiment has also included the data for the “average fees,” an indicator that measures the average amount of fees that investors are attaching to their Ethereum transactions currently. From the graph, it’s visible that this metric has been relatively low recently. It would appear that even though the rally has taken place, the network activity hasn’t yet exploded, as the fees generally shoot up when there is a high amount of traffic on the blockchain. The analytics firm notes, however, that this setup is quite similar to that observed back in March, following which Ethereum saw a rapid rise toward the $2,100 level. ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $1,800, up 12% in the last week.

42410312,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdFRKT,1687535475,SEC Sought Freeze Order Despite ‘No Evidence’ That Binance Was Moving U.S. Customer Funds,"In pretrial proceedings on June 15 in its case against Binance, lawyers for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) struggled to justify their request for a near-total financial freeze order against American arm Binance.US. Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who is expected to oversee the entire case, was palpably annoyed as the SEC lawyers tried to fill the gaping hole in their allegations with wilting word-salad.  The exchanges, available in transcript form, were reported in coverage of last week’s hearings, but made the rounds of crypto Twitter again this week. They add to the much broader impression that the Securities and Exchange Commission has overreached its mandate at many levels in its apparent crusade to destroy cryptocurrency as a technology and industry in the United States.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  It also adds to increasing signs of displeasure with these tactics from other branches of government.  ‘The assets are not going offshore’  The June 15 hearing considered the SEC’s June 6 request for an emergency injunction to freeze the assets of Binance.US, and to repatriate to the U.S. assets held abroad by related entities including Binance.com.  The request could be seen as part of the SEC’s larger attempt to paint Binance as not just in violation of U.S. securities law, but as a fundamentally fraudulent parallel to FTX. Requesting an asset freeze to ensure, as the SEC put it, “that Binance.US customers’ assets are protected and remain in the United States” suggests a belief that U.S. customer assets are at risk of being stolen by Binance entities or officials abroad.  The SEC has already seemingly failed to convince one important counterpart of this parallel: the U.S. Department of Justice has so far declined to file parallel criminal charges against Binance or CEO Changpeng Zhao. In the case of FTX and its CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, civil and criminal charges were filed within hours of each other.  As Judge Amy Berman pressed the SEC’s lawyers, it became increasingly clear that the SEC had at best circumstantial grounds for its requested freeze. Jackson expressed sharp frustration when the SEC could not provide any clear sign that U.S. customer assets had been, or were planned to be, exfiltrated by Binance International.  “It's happening or it's not?” Judge Jackson asked at one point. “It's kind of stunning to me that I've now asked this question to each of you [SEC lawyers] five times” without getting a clear answer.  “So currently the assets are not going offshore,” replied SEC counsel Jennifer Farer. “…the current accounts, we're not seeing any flows of money [to] outside of the United States.”  Judge Jackson also noted seeming discrepancies in earlier documents supporting the injunction request.  See also: Can Binance Survive the SEC's Charges? | Opinion  “There are a lot of details about amounts transferred and where they went…” Jackson asked the SEC’s lawyers. “You say these funds consisted in significant part of Binance platforms, plural, customer assets, including those of Binance.US … Can you clarify or walk me through the transfers you allege were made specifically from the U.S. entities, as opposed to the international Binance platform, to offshore accounts held by Zhao, and how you know that those were customer assets?”  The SEC lawyers did not appear to provide that clarity.  Instead, SEC counsel returned repeatedly to large transactions involving offshore entities. In one instance when Jackson pressed for detail on the claims of U.S. customer funds “dissipating” abroad, the SEC’s Matthew Scarlato repeated SEC claims that funds had moved among Binance.com, CEO Changpeng Zhao’s personal entity Merit Peak and the holding company Key Vision.  Farer elsewhere claimed that assets flowing out of the U.S. were in fact not the key issue, because the freeze order on Binance.US was also intended to protect U.S. investor assets abroad. “We are concerned about all U.S. investors, both those on the domestic platform, Binance.US, and the international platform, Binance.com.”  This again left Judge Jackson seemingly flummoxed. “What you said in your memo was we need this [injunction] because we don't have sufficient reassurance that Binance.US customer assets … are in the control of BAM Trading. And you said you're concerned about the safety and security of those assets. And now you just told me, well, no, actually, the [injunction] is about all the investors on both platforms. What is it? Which is it?”  Binance has maintained that Merit Peak has not received customer funds, and is only a vehicle for Zhao’s own personal wealth and trading. That’s still questionably ethical if true – it could mean CZ was trading against his customers. But Judge Jackson did not seem to find it relevant to the question of Binance.US and the security of customer funds there. Jackson later in the hearing cited arguments by Binance that the SEC had “no evidence” of a risk to U.S. customer funds.  Pre-crime injunction  The SEC argued instead that the Merit Peak transactions, and similar international flows, were sufficient cause for concern about Binance.US customer assets. They also cited concerns about who had real control of certain multi-signature wallets holding Binance.US assets.  In other words, the SEC to a degree seemed to argue that the freeze was necessary because the misuse of Binance.US customer funds was possible, not because there was any clear sign it had or would occur.  But Judge Jackson seemed skeptical of this “Minority Report”-style “pre-crime” argument. Ultimately, she rejected the SEC’s request for an emergency asset freeze – an early defeat in a potentially lengthy trial. More importantly, Jackson at times seemed to feel the SEC’s lawyers were trying to mislead or confuse her.  “I'm still trying to get to the money coming from the U.S. platform customers,” she repeated, seemingly exasperated, after Scarlato’s disquisition about Merit Peak.  This series of courtroom exchanges is important to Binance’s case, and may provide an early hint that the SEC’s case is not airtight. But more importantly, it provides a window into the reasoning and mindset of the SEC’s broader crypto crackdown, which has come to include not just Binance but U.S. based Coinbase, the stablecoin Paxos and other assorted targets.  The courtroom kerfuffle parallels a broader series of indicators that the SEC has overplayed its hand with its ongoing crypto crackdown, particularly in political terms. While the agency may be on solid legal ground on the letter of securities law, the argument that their approach is more generally flawed has begun to take hold. Republican lawmakers have quickly coalesced to push back, such as in a recent House hearing when congressmen grilled a witness from Prometheum, the SEC’s poorly hand-picked “regulated crypto exchange.”  See also: The SEC Is Fighting the Last War | Opinion  Far more significantly, though, there is chatter from sources close to Capitol Hill that a growing number of Democrats are beginning to question the SEC’s approach.  This early exchange in the Binance prosecution captures the deeper problem with the SEC’s entire agenda: it is based on a presumption of guilt and criminality, not just for one organization, but for an entire technology.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING | BNB,David Z.

The payment is part of a $50M penalty that BlockFi owes to the Wall Street regulator for failing to register its crypto lending product. The platform was said to have agreed to settle the charges in February 2022 but it filed for Chapter 11 shortly after the meltdown of crypto exchange FTX ( FTT-USD ) in November. The SEC, nonetheless, agreed to forego the $30M payment ""in order to maximize the amount that may be distributed to investors and avoid delay in such distribution,"" the filing from Thursday said . Fellow crypto lender Nexo reportedly offered to buy BlockFi for $850M in July of last year, but the latter turned down the offer and moved forward to be bailed out by FTX US. But FTX US also filed for Chapter 11, so the deal never went through. Without securing a rescue deal, BlockFi has been attempting to repay its creditors, getting the green light in January 2023 to sell its crypto mining assets in an effort to repay its creditors.

Shares of the Texas-based crypto miner surged as much as 17% on Nasdaq after the announcement, its second AI hosting agreement in two months.  Like other crypto miners, Applied Digital has been looking for alternative revenue streams to bolster income amid lukewarm crypto markets. Possibilities include AI, cloud computing and other high-performance computing applications that are forecast to continue growing.  The agreement follows one in May that Applied Digital said was worth up to $180 million in the next two years. It has partnered with hardware maker Supermicro for its AI and cloud offering.  Miners have access to cheap electricity and data center infrastructure, which can be deployed to power other types of data centers. Once they take that route, however, they have to build customer-facing capabilities, compete with infrastructure giants like Amazon Web Services and, often, improve the quality of their data centers.

The ruling, which won a 5-4 majority, allows Coinbase to continue its effort to compel arbitration against the putative class action lawsuit, halting the lawsuit's progress through the federal court system in the meantime. While this marks a win for Coinbase, it has little direct effect on the crypto industry.  ""The sole question here is whether the district court must stay its pre-trial and trial proceedings while the interlocutory appeal is ongoing.

The Supreme Court ruling doesn't touch on crypto issues beyond the fact that Coinbase is one of the two parties involved. However, it marks the first time a crypto company argued before the U.S. high court, and it may have implications on other lawsuits filed against the crypto exchange.

""The sole question before this Court is whether a district court must stay proceedings while the interlocutory appeal on arbitrability is ongoing. The answer is yes,"" wrote Justice Brett Kavanaugh in the majority opinion. He pointed to Griggs v. Provident Consumer Discount Co ., saying an appeal, including an interlocutory appeal, “divests the district court of its control over those aspects of the case involved in the appeal.” Other businesses supported Coinbase's ( COIN ) view that allowing litigation to proceed would result in unnecessary costs. If the district court moves ahead with pretrial and trial proceedings while the appeal over the use of arbitration is ongoing, ""then many of the asserted benefits of arbitration (efficiency, less expense, less intrusive discovery, and the like) would be irretrievably lost — even if the court of appeals later concluded that the case actually had belonged in arbitration all along,"" Kavanaugh wrote . The dissenting opinion, written by Justice Katanji Brown Jackson, said the majority's opinion that the ""mandatory-general-stay rule for interlocutory arbitrability appeals comes out of nowhere. No statute imposes it."" Her view contends that a trial judge has the authority to decide which parts of a case should continue and which ones should be paused pending appeal. The case arose from a lawsuit against Coinbase ( COIN ), where a customer alleged that the company failed to replace funds fraudulently taken from users accounts. In response, the company filed a motion to put the matter to arbitration, as its user agreement provides for resolving disputes through binding arbitration. In Friday morning trading, Coinbase ( COIN ) stock edged down 0.1% . Earlier this month, Coinbase ( COIN ) said it was willing to take its battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to the Supreme Court.

14120812,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=539365,1687532422,Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Continues To Rise While Market Sees Correction,"Bitcoin Cash (BC) has maintained a positive outlook over the past few days as bulls and bears struggle for control over the broader crypto market. Its growth suggests the bulls currently have the upper hand in the altcoin even while the broader crypto market shows a 0.7% decline. At the time of writing, BCH has added 9.06% to its past-day value changing hands at $143.22. It has also seen a 37.84% gain in seven days and 27.10% in the last 30 days. This bullish momentum allowed the token to secure the top position among the highest-gaining coins in the past 24 hours. Events Surrounding BCH Price Performance Whether Bitcoin Cash will sustain the upward trajectory remains uncertain since the crypto market is gradually turning bearish. However, the sentiment remains relatively bullish even though the trading volume has declined significantly. Related Reading: Breaking Through This Ceiling Will Propel XRP By Another 12% Right now, institutional interest is still high following the launch of the Wall Street-backed crypto exchange EDX Market. Notably, the exchange listed four tokens, Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash, garnering the attention of crypto investors. Also, the crypto trading platform derives support from Charles Schwab, a top US-based investment advisor and brokerage firm, Fidelity Investments, and Ken Griffin’s Citadel Securities. The exchange also announced new investors, including DV Crypto, GTS, Miami International Holdings, GSR Markets LTD, and HRT Technology. And participants in the space believe the launch of EDX would facilitate institutional investments in crypto. Bitcoin Cash’s price rally stems from EDX’s launch as one of the cryptocurrencies listed on the exchange. The Securities and Exchange Commission’s view that most Proof-of-Stake network tokens are securities also drew attention to BCH. As such, the token has been rising in the last seven days. As of Thursday, June 22, Bitcoin Cash closed with a 26.54% price gain after opening the day at $136.31. With the continued momentum, the token now trades at $143.22. Also, the hype around BlackRock, WisdomTree, and Invesco’s spot BTC ETF application has influenced Bitcoin Cash’s price action. It bears mentioning that the approval of these spot ETF applications could facilitate Bitcoin’s legitimacy and boost institutional interest. Bitcoin Cash Analysis Using Technical Oscillators As of the time of analysis, Bitcoin Cash is trading above the Bollinger Bands indicator, which signifies that the asset’s price has surpassed its usual volatility range. This metric could imply strong upward momentum or a potential breakout. Traders may view this as a bullish signal, indicating a potential continuation of the upward trend and possibly considering new buying opportunities. Also, the asset’s Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is trading above its signal line, with the histogram bars displaying long green candles. Related Reading: Conflux Claims Its Place Among Top Altcoins As CFX Price Skyrockets 46% The position confirms the bullish momentum presented in Bitcoin Cash’s price, indicating a potential uptrend and long positions. The asset currently trades between its primary support and resistance levels of $104.72 and $148.55, respectively. According to the chart, the bulls are strongly pushing the price toward the significant resistance level of $148.55. A potential bullish movement might follow if the price successfully breaks this resistance level.

42420119,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUZyLF,1687531991,Will BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF Take the Spirit Out of the Honey Badger?,"What is Bitcoin for?  With a raft of recent announcements from big-name financial firms offering bitcoin (BTC) products, institutionalization of the biggest, most significant cryptocurrency looms. That will give urgency to this perennial, still unresolved question about its purpose.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Is bitcoin an alternative store of value, like gold, whose price to dollars is driven by its appeal as bulwark against monetary debasement in fiat currencies? (We could call this the Michael Saylor perspective.)  Is it a payment vehicle for people who are, for whatever reason, locked out of the financial system? (The El Salvador perspective, perhaps.)  It is in an activists’ tool, a mechanism for challenging power? (The Human Rights Foundation perspective.)  Or is it best thought of with a more open-ended mindset, viewing it as an unstoppable record-keeping platform onto which users can inscribe a wide range of valuable content? (The Taproot Wizards’ perspective.)  I like to think the answer is “all of the above.”  But if the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approves BlackRock’s, or WisdomTree’s or Invesco’s newly submitted exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications – admittedly a big “if,” given the SEC’s past stubbornness – and if it shows support for the new EDX crypto exchange from Fidelity, Charles Schwab, Citadel and other financial heavyweights, that liberal, anything-goes framing will likely get less airtime.  The financial advisors pitching these products to mainstream clients are going to want a simple story to tell. The question is: which one?  Inflation hedge?  Perhaps the most honest route is just to describe bitcoin as an uncorrelated asset, whose price over time moves independently of other assets, offering more stability to a diverse portfolio of assets, preserving value when stocks, bonds or commodities are down.  But that’s going to be unsatisfying to financial advisors and their Main Street clients. While they’ve by now been well trained to think in terms of diversification and hedges against risk, there’s usually an underlying event-driven story behind it. For example: when a recession looms and projected earnings fall, the decline in value of your variable-income stock holdings will be balanced by exposure to fixed-income assets such as bonds.  This is where the “inflation hedge” story for bitcoin is usually applied. But it’s not an easy one to tell. The cryptocurrency’s losses in 2022, as inflation kicked the global economy’s butt, defied the popular, short-term understanding that an inflation hedge instrument’s price should rise when consumer price rises accelerate.  On the other hand, with a long-term perspective, the bitcoin inflation hedge narrative holds up. With a 150x gain over the past decade, bitcoin has helped long-term holders offset the ongoing depletion in the dollar’s purchasing power more effectively than any other investment that was broadly available to them.  The problem is the financial industry wants a short-term story – after all, financial professionals are typically rewarded on the basis of quarterly results. It wants to be able to say that if X does Y, then bitcoin will do Z. And it’s just not that predictable.  Nonetheless, I suspect Wall Street will gravitate toward the Saylor perspective. It needs to find a story of some sort – although many ETF investors might happily place “number go up” bets on bitcoin without caring why its price should rise, this heavily regulated industry can’t frame things as naked gambling – and the long-term store-of-value idea the most palatable one.  See also: What Bitcoin's Inflation Hedge Narrative Needs: More Time | Opinion  It’s easiest told as the “digital gold” story, one with a ready-made analogy that’s familiar to U.S. investors, the idea of an asset that can perform independently of monetary policy. (Skeptics will naturally revive the aforementioned 2022 experience, when bitcoin’s price declined while gold’s rose as expectations for Federal Reserve rate hikes grew. Wall Street’s ETF hawkers will just have to push through all that with a long-term story about buy-and-hold retirement strategies.)  Implications  One reason this matters is because the narrative will help dictate policy. If bitcoin is purely viewed as a hedging instrument for investors, it will play into the ongoing regulation push in Washington D.C. Even though bitcoin has escaped the Securities and Exchange Commission’s current dragnet, slapping the “security” label on every other crypto token – except, perhaps, ether – this framing will strengthen other regulatory positions that can, indirectly, curtail bitcoin’s usage growth, if not its price.  The most important involve privacy, know-your-customer (KYC) rules and so forth. If the establishment recognized bitcoin as a form of money – in addition to, or instead of seeing it as an investment vehicle – then the case for allowing greater privacy is stronger. But if the conversation in the U.S. is now to be even more intensely built around the store-of-value investment strategy, it’s harder for people to argue against greater KYC demands by regulators.  After all, these investment institutions, for whom compliance with such rules is par for the course, have nothing to lose from supporting that kind of surveillance. (And a lot to gain, if consumer demand is as strong as some financial institutions have suggested, even in the depths of the bear market.)  That isn’t great news for the millions who want the Bitcoin protocol to be a tool for financial inclusion or for people under oppressive systems to safely move money around.  It’s also not great for the new breed of developers working on Bitcoin-based tokens such as the non-fungible token (NFT)-like Taproot Wizards project built on the Ordinals protocol or the new BRC-20 tokens. KYC at the exchange level hinders the mainstream global reach of such innovative projects – especially if initiatives like the Financial Action Task Force’s crypto “travel rule” find a backdoor way to indirectly impose reporting rules on self-custody wallets.  But let’s take a deep breath. In the words of fans who see it as “the Honey Badger of Money,” at the end of the day, “Bitcoin doesn’t care.” The network will keep ticking along, block after block, regardless of what Washington or Wall Street want to do with investment and exchanges of its token.  Bitcoin’s protocol is unstoppable. In fact, if the ETFs are approved and mainstream investment surges into bitcoin, which would drive up the price and attract more hashing power to the mining network, the cost-of-attack security proposition behind the Bitcoin protocol – the essence of its “unstoppable-ness” – just gets stronger.  Presented with this open-source unstoppable, uncensorable protocol, innovators are going to do what they always do: innovate. So, inevitably, there will be workarounds to all of this. New ways to engage with all those other Bitcoin use cases without being ensnared in a Washington/Wall Street regulatory bind will emerge.  See also: Bitcoin Was a Winner During the U.S. Banking Crisis, but Illiquidity Prevents It From Being a USD Hedge | Opinion  The big takeaway from this institutionalization thing, then, is that it marks an intensification in the ongoing cat-and-mouse battle between Bitcoin, which wants to defy labels and traditional roles, and the financial establishment, which wants to define it and thereby control it.

Regulators stepped in to protect creditors of the bank after it collapsed in March.

After SVB exposures were revealed in March, Circle briefly de-pegged from the dollar before recovering. Its Chief Executive Officer Jeremy Allaire told the Consensus conference in April that the company has strengthened its infrastructure since the incident.

After the digital asset crossed the $30,000 resistance, there was speculation that bulls have finally run out of steam, so the price was expected to correct downward. However, BTC’s current levels combined with the crypto investor sentiment suggest that there could be more runway for the digital asset. Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Remains Firmly In Greed Presently, the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index is at one of the highest levels that it has been in the last year. After a long stretch in the neutral and fear territory, Bitcoin has finally moved back once more into the greed territory, signaling positive sentiment from investors. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Becomes 14th Largest Cryptocurrency As Bull Rally Heats Up The index is currently sitting at a score of 65, continuing Thursday’s bullish sentiment. It is now almost 20 points above its last week’s cumulative value of 47 and this shows the genuine jump in investor sentiment going from fearful to greedy. Fear & Greed Index returns to greed as investor sentiment recovers | Source: alternative.me The last time that the index was this high was back in April when Bitcoin’s price broke the $31,000 level for the first time in 2023. So it is possible that the current rally could continue on with time given that the rally that led to BTC climbing above $31,000 in April lasted for about a month. As of now, the crypto market has been rallying for only about two days, so it is too early for exhaustion on the part of buyers. With more investors feeling greedy and rushing to the market to take advantage of the recovery, they will end up pushing the price even higher. Bitcoin At $35,000 Is Possible The crypto market rally is being propelled forward by the entrance of institutional investors into the space. This includes the like of BlackRock and WisdomTree filing for Bitcoin ETFs. Now, the response from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is not expected for another couple of months, which leaves room for speculation to continue to drive up the price of the assets. This positive sentiment surrounding the ETF filings can push the price farther up to the $35,000 level, which is the next major resistance for BTC. Once this happens, then $40,000 is the next level to beat, at which point, exhaustion and correction back downwards can be expected. BTC price reclaims $30,000 | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com If the ETFs do get approved this year, then BTC’s price will likely rally to its previous all-time high of $69,000 as around $20 billion in institutional investor funding is expected to flow into the market initially. As time goes on, this inflow will only continue to rise, propping up the price of the digital asset. Related Reading: US Bitcoin Investor Trading Volume Rises, Stage Set For Another Massive Rally?

14118102,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=539346,1687525201,Is Chainlink The Most Undervalued Altcoin? It’s Do Or Die For LINK,"Chainlink (LINK) is one of the cryptocurrencies that has suffered the most from the weakness of the altcoins. The LINK price has collapsed after 397 days in the range between $9.62 and $5.32, which is an extremely bearish signal. But the good news is that, after falling below support at $5.32 on 10 June, the bulls have managed to regain the level for the time being. Nevertheless, the Chainlink price is not out of the woods yet. A do-or-die moment could loom within the next few days and weeks. The renowned crypto analyst @DaanCrypto has pointed this out. Via Twitter, the analyst shared the chart below and explained that LINK could enter Phase C, the “spring”, within the Wyckoff analysis. For this to happen, however, the range must be held: $LINK Followed the plan. It deviated below its 400-day range and retook it. Wouldn’t expect this to outperform many of the new shiny coins, but the invalidation is clear as day and the risk/reward is solid. It’s do or die here, $LINK Marines. Dutch analyst Michaël van de Poppe believes the current moment offers a great opportunity. On 17 June, he tweeted, “The best time to accumulate your altcoins and Chainlink is now.” In a recent tweet, he wrote that the thesis is still valid: It’s undervalued and a synonym for the depression on altcoins. The expansion is, most likely, going to come, but it needs to break through $6 in order to make that happen. Related Reading: Chainlink (LINK) Whale Transfers Spike, Bearish Sign? Key Targets For Chainlink Bulls A look at the 1-day chart using the Fibonacci retracement levels shows that the LINK marines should not celebrate too early. Only if the $5.92 level (23.6% Fibonacci level) can be permanently regained, the bulls can celebrate a first round victory. Before that, there is always the danger that a new drop outside the previous 397-day trading range will happen. The way to the upper end of the trading range will not be easy at all. At the price level of $6.61, great selling pressure is to be expected, just like at the 200-day EMA, which is currently located at $6.86. Beyond that, $7.20 (50% Fibonacci level) and 8.60 (78.6% Fibonacci level) are crucial. Related Reading: Chainlink Bulls Must Uphold This Critical Support Line For Potential 8% Rally Huge Catalyst Coming This Summer? One event the LINK Marines are eagerly awaiting is the release of the Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP). The LINK influencer @ChainlinkWoman wrote yesterday, “Chainlink just confirmed CCIP is being released on mainnet this SUMMER, SmartCon2023 is going to be fire.” The user is referring to Chainlink’s latest development update. In it, it was announced that CCIP, a global standard for cross-chain communication that provides a universal connection between any public and private blockchain, is about to be launched on mainnet. As final steps, the Chainlink devs plan to complete security audits. In addition, further tests with beta partners are planned. After that comes the “mainnet launch,with early access for users in the testing program prior to the general availability launch.” Featured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com",NEUTRAL,LINK,ALTCOIN | BLOCKCHAIN | LINK | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/chainlink/chainlink-most-undervalued-altcoin-do-or-die-link/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/14118102.jpeg

In the past 24-hours it has increased by more than 10% to $143, its highest level since February, according to CoinDesk data.  Open interest, a metric used to assess the nominal value of open trades on a specific asset, has risen by 77% to a nine-month high $135 million according to Coinalyze data.  The rise in open interest suggests a shift in positive sentiment with hopes that the asset can experience institutional adoption after being listed on EDX.  Bitcoin Cash was issued in July 2017 after it forked the original Bitcoin's blockchain. It made a record high of $2,947 during the peak of the 2017 bull market. However, despite early optimism, adoption of Bitcoin Cash as a payments network has paled into insignificance compared to its sibling.  Over the past seven days, the total amount of transactions on the Bitcoin Cash network worth more than $100,000 is at $129 million.

42420130,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUZyWb,1687522211,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Might Take a Breather,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin (BTC) has chalked up a more than 20% price gain since Thursday last week, and may now take a breather. That's the message from crypto services provider Matrixport's Bitcoin Greed & Fear Index (GFI), which has jumped to 93% from under 10% in roughly one week. The index attempts to track the overriding market emotion, with readings above 90% signaling greed, or excess optimism, and those below 10% representing extreme fear or pessimism. ""Our Bitcoin Greed & Fear Index has reached exuberant levels in record time. It could be well advised to lock in some gains for short-term traders,"" Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at Matrixport, said in an email.  Crypto custody firm Prime Trust has ""a shortfall in customer funds"" and was unable to meet all withdrawal requests this month, the Nevada Department of Business and Industry said Thursday. The department's Financial Institutions Division, which oversees state-regulated trust companies, ordered Prime Trust to cease all activities that violate Nevada regulations, alleging that the company's ""overall financial condition ... has considerably deteriorated to a critically deficient level."" Prime Trust is ""operating at a substantial deficit"" or may even be insolvent, the order said. ""On or about June 21, 2023, Respondent was unable to honor customer withdrawals due to a shortfall of customer funds caused by a significant liability on the Respondent's balance sheet owed to customers,"" the order said.  Banking giant JPMorgan (JPM) has expanded its blockchain-based settlement token JPM Coin to euro-denominated payments, Bloomberg reported on Friday. JPM Coin went live with euro payments on Wednesday, according to the report, which cited the bank's head of coin systems for Europe, Basak Toprak. German tech firm Siemens conducted the first euro payment on the platform. Since its inception in 2019, over $300 billion in transactions have been processed using JPM Coin, making it one of the most extensive uses of blockchain technology by a traditional financial institution. The system allows JPMorgan's institutional clients to make wholesale payments between accounts around the world using blockchain tech.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows net flow of coins into addresses owning 0.1% or more of BTC supply since January.  Early this week, net inflows into the so-called large holders' addresses rose to an year-to-date high of 114,630 BTC.  ""Not only are large transactions climbing, whales appear to be accumulating,"" IntoTheBlock said in the latest edition of the weekly newsletter. ""Comparing this with CEX net flows, we can confirm that the entities accumulating are not exchange-related as their net flows were negative while large holders' were highly positive.""

Stacks (STX), one of the notable performers in recent days, is not left out of the current ebb and flow of the market, with its value experiencing a significant decline in the last few hours. According to data from CoinMarketCap, STX is down by 10.14% in the last day, representing the biggest loss in the top 100 cryptocurrencies today. However, looking at STX’s wider price movement, the ERC-20 token’s present downturn may not present much worry to its investors.

At the time of writing, Stacks is trading at $0.776, with a 0.96% gain in the last hour. However, additional data from CoinMarketCap shows the token’s daily trading volume is down by 26.41%, falling to a value of $235 million. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Hitting A Yearly High Today? What Matters Today That said, STX remains the 40th biggest cryptocurrency in the market, boasting a massive market cap value of $1 billion. Stacks In 2023 So Far Stacks has been one of the major headliners of 2023, with the token recording a total percentage increase of 290% since the start of the year. Like most cryptocurrencies, Stacks began the year with a slow pace, recording little price gains in January, as its value rose from $0.21 on January 1 to $0.269 by January 31. In mid-February, STX eventually picked up pace surging by 241% to hit a market price of $0.988 on March 2. However, this positive ascent was soon followed by a significant downtrend, causing the token’s value to plummet as low as $0.575 just one week later. Thereafter, Stacks resumed its bullish trajectory to hit its highest market price of 2023 thus far, peaking at $1.176 on March 18. Following such price gains, the STX market showed no significant price movement before sliding into a bearish state that lasted for over two months prior to the token’s recent boost in price in the last week. STX Trading At $0.774 | STXUSD Chart On Tradingview.com What Next For Stacks? According to STX’s 4-hour chart, its Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows the token has just left the overbought zone indicating the current bearish trend may be more than just a price recorrection. Related Reading: 75% Of Bitcoin Holders At Spot Rates Are Making Money: Data Furthermore, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) has just crossed below the signal line, also indicating that STX’s price will likely remain on the downtrend for now.

14116747,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/06/microstrategy-bitcoin-bet-starting-to-pay-off,1687521600,Microstrategy’s Bitcoin Bet Starting To Pay Off,"MicroStrategy has turned a profit on its significant Bitcoin investment as the premier cryptocurrency soars the charts. MicroStrategy Turns A Profit With Bitcoin finally overcoming the $30,000 price tag hurdle, leading business intelligence firm and largest institutional BTC-holder, MicroStrategy, is finally turning a profit on its reserves. The company had gone all in on its audacious investment strategy, religiously allocating a portion of its capital to buy the dip and stock up its Bitcoin reserves. The strategy seems to have paid off, with the cryptocurrency breaking through the $30,000 ceiling and staying consistently above it for the last several hours, at the time of writing. The price surge has helped MicroStrategy’s funds and turned profitable. TradFi Renews BTC Interest The company has invested millions of dollars into its Bitcoin strategy across several installments made in a time when the market was exceptionally volatile and the crypto was barely breaking the $20k threshold. However, recently there has been an increasing institutional interest in the crypto owing to the number of spot Bitcoin ETF applications from several major TradFi players like BlackRock Investments, WisdomTree, and Invesco. As a direct result, Bitcoin has seen a significant price increase as investors are hoping to have more investment options, should these BTC ETF applications be approved. The Big Spot BTC ETF Push Following a successful first quarter, Bitcoin briefly maintained its positive momentum in the second quarter. In mid-April, the leading cryptocurrency surpassed the $31,000 mark. However, it soon entered a correction phase, experiencing weeks of underwhelming performance amidst legal controversies. Bitcoin's rally reignited after BlackRock submitted its Bitcoin ETF application. Just recently, crypto expert, Ki Young Ju pointed out that MicroStrategy's Bitcoin holdings, which amount to 140,000 BTC, were close to reaching the break-even point at $30,045. Today, when Bitcoin's price reached that level, the portfolio completely recovered from all its previous losses. Currently, with Bitcoin priced at $30,057, the company’s holdings have continued their profitable run. Saylor’s Conviction Wins Out The company's investment has placed it among the few publicly traded companies to hold a significant amount of Bitcoin on their balance sheets. MicroStrategy's CEO, Michael Saylor, has been a vocal advocate for Bitcoin and has been instrumental in shaping the company's cryptocurrency investment strategy. He has repeatedly emphasized Bitcoin's potential as a long-term store of value and hedge against inflation and most recently claimed that the regulatory crackdown on altcoins, could result in Bitcoin’s market dominance to reach 80% in the long term.

42420128,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUZyUX,1687519620,Crypto Market Optimism Bumps Into Risk-Off Hints in TradFi,"After being starved for good news for over a year, the crypto market was buoyed last week by spot bitcoin ETF filings by BlackRock, Invesco and WisdomTree.  While crypto traders responded positively, pushing bitcoin (BTC) higher by more than 20% in the past eight days, they may want to be vigilant because some traditional market indicators hint at risk aversion ahead.  One of the lessons of the past three years is that digital assets do not remain disconnected from traditional finance (TradFi) for long, and a notable decline in stocks and risk assets often roils sentiment in the crypto market. To see where those stand, take a look at the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), also known as Wall Street's ""fear gauge,"" and the futures tied to it.  The spread between the most expensive VIX futures contract and the index itself has widened to levels that have historically marked major tops in the S&P 500 benchmark equity index, which is also a bellwether for risk assets worldwide, including cryptocurrencies.  ""We are seeing a really high spread now, which is a sign of a top for prices,"" Tom McClellan, a technical analyst and editor of The McClellan Market Report, tweeted Thursday.  The above-60% reading, a result of the VIX falling a little too far below the futures contracts, suggests extreme optimism among stock traders, often observed at market tops. A similar reading was seen in early January 2022, just before stocks began descending from record highs.  The indicator also caught the eye of trader and analyst James Choi, who has been bullish on bitcoin and technology stocks since January.  According to Choi, the recent widening of the junk bond spreads along with declines in oil and traditional inflation hedges like gold and silver suggest a deflationary bust ahead (a major risk-off event).  Junk bond spread refers to the difference between the yields on high-risk, high-return bonds and the safer U.S. Treasurys. The widening spread indicates that investors are demanding larger premium to invest in riskier debt.  Both Choi and Sven Henrich, founder and chief market strategist at NorthmanTrader, say U.S. dollar liquidity is being sucked out of the system. That's bearish for bitcoin, which is a heavily influenced by changes in the fiat liquidity, and other risk assets.  Bitcoin rallied along with stocks early this year as the U.S. Treasury's decision to use its cash balance after the government hit the debt limit improved liquidity conditions.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value was changing hands at $30,070 at press time, according to CoinDesk data.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/06/23/crypto-market-optimism-accompanied-by-signs-of-potential-risk-off-in-tradfi,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/16b29e51d16b8a57e68299517769eb93edeab495-1920x801.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

14114885,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=539329,1687516803,Breaking Through This Ceiling Will Propel XRP By Another 12%,"The price of XRP experienced an increase after surpassing the $0.50 mark; however, it has recently undergone a fresh decline. Analyzing the daily chart, the altcoin has depreciated by approximately 3%, whereas the weekly chart shows an appreciation of about 6%. The technical outlook for XRP indicates a bearish bias due to a decrease in demand and accumulation shown on the chart. Buying strength has weakened following the coin’s drop below the $0.50 threshold. As Bitcoin entered the $30,000 price range, other major altcoins also began to appreciate on their respective charts but remained constrained beneath immediate resistance levels. So it is crucial for XRP to surpass the $0.50 mark to enable an upward movement. Related Reading: Conflux Claims Its Place Among Top Altcoins As CFX Price Skyrockets 46% Currently, the $0.50 price level acts as a significant barrier that needs to be converted into immediate support. If the altcoin manages to consistently trade above $0.50 for a substantial number of sessions, it may initiate a rally. The market capitalization of XRP has also declined, indicating a decrease in buying strength. XRP Price Analysis: One-Day Chart Following its failure to maintain a price above $0.50, the altcoin was trading at $0.49. With a small boost from buyers, there is potential for the altcoin to once again surpass the $0.50 threshold. An important resistance level for XRP is situated at $0.53. If this resistance is overcome, XRP could make an attempt to trade above $0.56, resulting in a significant 12% rally. Conversely, a decline from the current price level would bring XRP down to $0.47. The volume of XRP traded during the last session was in the red, indicating that selling pressure outweighed buying pressure. Technical Analysis Despite a slight recovery attempt in buying strength, investor confidence was dampened by the recent price dip. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) was positioned just below the half-line, suggesting that sellers outnumbered buyers at the time of writing. Additionally, the price of the asset dropped below the 20-Simple Moving Average line, indicating a decline in demand and signaling that sellers were driving the price momentum in the market. Despite a decline in sell signals on the daily chart though, XRP remained under the control of sellers. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), which illustrates price momentum and its changes, displayed red signal bars associated with sell signals. The Bollinger Bands, which indicate the price volatility and fluctuations, were wide but parallel, suggesting that XRP may not trade within a narrow range.

14114222,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/06/will-the-crypto-rally-continue,1687514987,Will the crypto rally continue?,"Was bitcoin’s latest surge just a last fling before sinking lower, or does it have the legs to continue on upwards? Just a narrative pump? Some analysts and commentators would have us believe that there just isn’t the market order flow for any sustained moves, and it must be said that volume is quite low, having been so since late March. A short term relief rally to the upside? Is everyone just FOMOing in because of all the new ETF filings which began with Blackrock’s Spot Bitcoin ETF application of just a week ago and then the subsequent Fidelity, Wisdom Tree, Invesco, and Valkyrie filings, and then the Wall Street-backed EDX Markets? This is likely the case. Bitcoin and crypto haven’t had much to shout about for quite a while so the perceived positive news here does look to be responsible for the price action, and perhaps it’s just a matter of time before the ETF narrative starts to die down. Also, could it be that the traditional institutions are coordinating with the SEC with a view to taking down the crypto businesses before providing their own solutions taken from the crypto innovations? Bullish in the short term Be this as it may, at least in the short term, bitcoin is still looking strong. After briefly touching $30,800 bitcoin looks as though it is forming a bull flag, although another touch of the flag bottom is probably needed. The 4-hour Stochastic RSI has reset to the bottom and we should see a cross up soon. Ethereum is behaving in a similar way, and looks to be breaking out of its own bull flag already. In relation to BTC, ETH has been rather a laggard though, and has been steadily forming lower highs and lows from all the way back to September of 2022. A bottom could now have been found given that ETH is currently sitting at the 0.618 Fibonacci level against its BTC pair. Also, with the ongoing ETH staking narrative helping to drastically reduce the market supply, perhaps this is the time for Ethereum to start to shine. Many altcoins will die As for the rest of the crypto market it does rather look as though the altcoins as a whole are not going to do their usual thing and rise en masse. Instead, a small group of alts, with strong use cases and narratives might be the only ones to make the big moves. Things are changing in crypto, and previous cycles where just about anything might rocket skywards on a given day is likely not to happen any more.

The United States Securities and Exchange Commission has taken an increasingly hostile stance against the crypto ecosystem under Gensler. BlackRock Spot ETF’s SEC Headache There have been several applications for spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) in recent times. However, all have been rejected by the regulator that is responsible for approving Exchange Traded Funds, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is the latest to apply for a Bitcoin spot ETF. While there is optimism that BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF application could be the first to get approval, an analysis by trading firm QCP Capital has dampened that optimism. According to QCP Capital’s assessment, a spot Bitcoin ETF, whether BlackRock’s or any other, is not likely in the near future primarily due to Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler and his harsh attitude toward cryptocurrencies. QCP added that while institutional involvement and interest in Bitcoin was bound to increase, the SEC’s current makeup means that it is unlikely that spot ETFs would get the green light. BlackRock had filed its spot ETF earlier during the month, with a filing by the Nasdaq stock exchange revealing that Coinbase Custody Trust Company would be the custodian of the fund’s Bitcoin holdings, while the Bank of New York Mellon would be the custodian of the fund’s fiat currency. A Hurdle Called Gensler The picture is further complicated by current Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, who has taken a hostile stance against cryptocurrencies in general. Under his leadership, the SEC has initiated several lawsuits against major cryptocurrency exchanges. These include Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, and Coinbase. QCP Capital, in its assessment, wrote, “However, with Gensler as head of the SEC, we are not confident of the actual ETF approval happening in the near term. Nevertheless, as we’ve continually maintained, there is a huge place for institutional BTC and ETH in the asset management world, and over the next months and years, we will see further steps in that direction.” QCP Capital’s observation is interesting, especially as it was highlighted that BlackRock had received just one rejection out of a total of 576 prior applications. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust Rebounds As a result of the knock-on effects of the BlackRock spot Bitcoin ETF has reflected in Bitcoin’s (BTC) price performance and beyond. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), having seen a considerable rebound after trading nearly 50% below BTC/USD, has continued to see an upswing as it makes up lost ground. According to data sourced from CoinGlass, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust’s discount to BTC spot (discount to net asset value) reached its smallest level of 2023 at 33.45%. According to QCP, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust has seen its sharpest recovery since late 2020. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

42420117,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUZyKD,1687509688,"Alameda Seeks Return of $700M Paid to ‘Super Networkers’ for Celebrity, Political Access","Alameda Research, the hedge fund arm of the bankrupt FTX empire, is seeking the return of $700 million founder Sam Bankman-Fried appears to have paid for access to celebrities and politicians.  The billions promised to “super networkers” Michael Kives and Bryan Baum show Bankman-Fried’s disregard for formalities in spending money from companies he treated as a “slush fund,” lawyers for FTX’s new management said in the Thursday court filing.  Kives – a former aide to both Bill and Hillary Clinton – and Baum “acted with dishonest minds” by accepting money, which personally benefited Bankman-Fried without providing Alameda with any equivalent payoff, the allegations read.  “Bankman-Fried treated the legal entities that he controlled as a slush fund operated with a near-total disregard for corporate formalities,” the filing by FTX added, echoing previous criticisms of poor management at the exchange, which filed for bankruptcy in November.  Bankman-Fried appeared starstruck by a February 2022 party at Kives’ house where fellow guests included a former Presidential candidate, actors, reality TV stars, musicians and multiple billionaires. Within weeks, Bankman-Fried had signed a document promising to invest billions in Kives’ and Baum’s companies, with little details on what FTX would gain in return, the filing said.  “The Term Sheet was little more than a cursory list of investment ideas” on which “no meaningful due diligence was conducted,” the filing said, citing an internal note in which Bankman-Fried said the company could “consider endorsements with their friends … work with them on Democratic politics … invest in them or some stuff, idk [I don’t know].”  Bankman-Fried also failed to clarify whether Baum was an employee of FTX or a third party, saying in an internal document that “it’s sorta complicated and liminal and unclear. Bryan lives in the uncanny valley.”  Transfers of $700 million made from Bankman-Fried’s companies to Kives’ and Baum’s had the badges of fraud under bankruptcy law, being concealed, having inflated value, and being made when FTX was about to become insolvent, the filing said.  In an emailed statement sent to CoinDesk, Elizabeth Ashford, a spokesperson for K5 Global, the company founded by Kives and Baum, said that K5 ""was under the impression – like many others – that [Bankman-Fried] was completely legitimate, and that they were entering into a fair, long-term, and mutually beneficial business relationship. Our belief is that the lawsuit is without merit.”  Bankman-Fried and Alameda's affiliates had bought a third of K5's general partnership for cash and stock in 2022, ultimately making a $400 million investment in funds the company managed, Ashford said, adding that the venture capital firm had over $1 billion in assets under management aside from Bankman-Fried's interests, with investments in 148 companies.

The sum is what's left over from a $50 million penalty owed to the SEC by BlockFi to settle charges of failing to register with the regulator for the offering and sale of its crypto lending product. The platform agreed to the settlement in February 2022 but filed for bankruptcy in November following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX.  The regulator asserted its claims should be counted as part of ""general unsecured claims"" in the ongoing Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, but agreed to forego the payment ""in order to maximize the amount that may be distributed to investors and avoid delay in such distribution,"" according to the agreement reached on June 22.  The SEC was likely among the first creditors in line to receive payment from BlockFi, Sasha Hodder, founder of Hodder Law, a firm that specializes in crypto law, told CoinDesk in November.  “The customers are really at the bottom of the list here,” Hodder said at the time.  In May, a New Jersey bankruptcy court judge said BlockFi customers can be repaid $300 million in funds held in custodial wallets on the platform. While the bankrupt estate has presented a reorganization plan to the court due for a hearing in July, BlockFi has said $1 billion in claims against fallen crypto enterprise FTX and its sister trading firm Alameda will be the ""largest driver"" of fund recoveries for customers and creditors.

42420127,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUZyST,1687508517,Only Bitcoin Miners With Low Power Costs and High Sustainable Energy Mix Will Survive: JPMorgan,"Bitcoin (BTC) miners with low electricity costs and a high sustainable energy mix are the only ones likely to survive in a progressively more competitive environment, JPMorgan (JPM) said in a research report Thursday.  The main cost in mining is electricity, which affects the overall cost of bitcoin production, the report said, adding that miners have been looking for cheaper and sustainable energy sources to protect their profitability.  Electricity prices have been falling, especially in the U.S., where most bitcoin mining firms are based, the bank said, noting that the U.S. is the largest bitcoin hashrate contributor. Hashrate refers to the total combined computational power used to mine and process transactions on a proof-of-work blockchain such as Bitcoin.  “Lower electricity costs should help contain the rise in the bitcoin production cost in the current phase of rising hashrate,” analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote.  The cost of power has played a vital role in the bear market of the past year as miners struggled to survive, the bank said.  The average price of electricity for bitcoin miners globally is about $0.05 per kilowatt hour (kWh), however, some large mining firms have been able to pay as little as $0.03/kWh, the note said.  Lower electricity costs help the large bitcoin miners keep bitcoin production costs down and “maintain their profitability even in the current highly competitive environment, where the hashrate has risen steeply making new record highs,” the note added.  “Vulnerable” miners, including Core Scientific (CORZQ), Argo Blockchain (ARB) and Iris Energy (IREN) have struggled to survive due to a “combination of falling bitcoin prices, rising debt servicing costs and rising electricity costs,” the analysts wrote. Miners with higher electricity costs have been facing losses due to falling bitcoin prices over the past year.  JPMorgan says that over time the bitcoin mining industry will consolidate and become more competitive because only miners with lower production costs will be able to survive.  Miners have also been trying to diversify their power mix with renewable sources in order to become more environmentally friendly, the report said.

14111777,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=539296,1687508415,Bitcoin Price Hitting A Yearly High Today? What Matters Today,"The Bitcoin price has rallied fast in the past few days as a result of the BlackRock news. The big question is whether the bulls can continue to push the price upwards, or whether they are slowly running out of steam. With this in mind, there is currently a striking similarity in the 1-day chart of BTC to the rally in mid-March 2023. Back then, the BTC price experienced a setback of over 22% after reaching a one-year high at $25,200. News from the macro and crypto environment were extremely bearish after USDC lost its peg to the US dollar and a renewed banking crisis loomed. However, as a result of rumors of a Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) bailout, BTC kicked off a 46% surge. Remarkably, this occurred in a double-pump with a one-day breather. Fast-forward to today, Bitcoin may be in that position again. As the Bitcoin price dipped below $25,000 on June 14, the news were ultra bearish (Tether FUD, SEC lawsuits, and more). Once again, however, BTC was saved by bullish news: BlackRock’s filing for a Bitcoin spot ETF. Related Reading: When BlackRock Bitcoin ETF? Detailed Timeline And Implications Since the news, BTC has risen by over 20%. Yesterday, the price took a breather. The million-dollar question: Will the second part of the pump come today, as in March, or has Bitcoin already experienced the double pump (see yellow circles). In this case, June 18 could have been the equivalent to the one-day breather of the March rally. Data Supports Bitcoin Bulls, But Caution Is Warranted According to the analysts at Greeks.live, BTC options may become important today. A total of 31,000 BTC options expire today with a put-call ratio of 0.73, a maximum pain point of $27,000 and a notional value of $930 million. Stimulated by the rise of BTC, the value of BTC options positions increased by almost 50% this week. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bulls Gear Up To Test $31,000 Resistance As Market Optimism Grows “The current BTC and ETH each major term IV inversion is obvious, now cross-currency IV arbitrage is very cost-effective, BTC IV long-term higher than the ETH is not sustainable,” the analysts note. Meanwhile, the on-chain experts from Glassnode stated yesterday that after the recent rally in the Bitcoin price, market participants took a non-trivial profit of $537 million, the second-largest profit-taking in the past year. However, other on-chain data presented by analyst Axel Adler Jr shows that there is still potential for a second leg up. As Adler writes, periods of low volatility (blue peaks) have historically been followed by rapid price movements (pink). These rallies have been bigger than the one BTC experienced over the last few days. Adler remarked: Over the last year, such fluctuations have reached up to 30-40%. We are currently experiencing another pink spike! Crypto trader @DaanCrypto also sees more upside potential looking at the spot premium: “Bitcoin spot premium already back. Usually not how tops look like. The $31K yearly high is the main area of interest.” [UPDATE: 10:40 am EST]: The BTC options expiry is out of the way and had no major impact on price.

A parallel criminal complaint against Ichioka has also been filed by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California on counts, including wire fraud, and securities and commodities fraud. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has also filed a ""parallel action.""  ""Ichioka promised to use customers’ assets to enter into retail foreign currency transactions (forex) through a commodity interest pool operating under the name “Ichioka Ventures,"" said CFTC Commissioner Kristin N. Johnson in a statement.  Ichioka has agreed to the charges and the CFTC has sought full recovery for the defrauded individuals and entities. Additionally, the CFTC has sought a civil monetary penalty, permanent trading and registration bans, and permanent injunctions against Ichioka.  A commodity pool is an investment vehicle that “pools” together money from many investors to trade.  According to the CFTC, Ichioka ran a fraudulent scheme from 2018 to 2021 where he took money from more than a hundred individuals to trade digital asset commodities, including bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), with the promise of a 10% return within 30 business days. Ichioka also maintained that participants could easily withdraw or reinvest their funds.  Instead, Ichioka used the $21 million to pay back some of the participants but also for his personal use and expenses, such as luxury automobiles and rent payments.

The allegation was made during a motion filed by lawyers representing Binance.US at the United States District Court for the District of Columbia on the 21st of June. SEC Deliberately Misleading The Public According to the arguments filed by lawyers representing Binance.US, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s assertions made during a press release on the 17th of June were misleading, and appealed to the financial regulator to adhere to the “applicable rules of conduct.” In its press release, the SEC accused Binance and CEO Changpeng Zhao of commingling customer assets. “Given that Changpeng Zhao and Binance have control of the platforms’ customers’ assets and have been able to commingle customer assets or divert customer assets as they please, as we have alleged, these prohibitions are essential to protecting investor assets.” The motion filed alleges that the Securities and Exchange Commission’s press release included statements that were unsupported by evidence and lacked substantiation. The lawsuit also stressed that the Securities and Exchange Commission presented no evidence to support its claims that Binance had commingled customer funds or diverted them as per its discretion. Binance representative stated, “The SEC has no evidence that BAM [Binance.US] customer assets have been dissipated, commingled or misused in any way.” It also alleged that the Securities and Exchange Commission’s press release was designed to introduce further unwarranted confusion into the crypto markets, having a detrimental impact on BAM customers. “SEC’s press release seemed designed to introduce unwarranted confusion into the marketplace, which could have the effect of harming BAM customers rather than protecting them. It also risks tainting the jury pool with misleading descriptions of the evidence concerning the Defendants.” Implications Of The Motion The motion filed against the SEC also stated that its press release risked prejudicing the jury pool by misleading descriptions of events related to the defendants in the case. Binance had also accused the Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler of having a conflict of interest, alleging that Gensler had sought an informal advisory role with Binance before he was appointed as the SEC chair. According to Binance’s lawyers, Gensler’s previous connection with the exchange could influence his actions and decisions as the head of the SEC. If the federal judge approves, the motion could have significant consequences for the SEC. For starters, it could limit the regulatory body’s ability to make public comments about the Binance lawsuit throughout the duration of the case, in particular, any comments that may impact court proceedings. To support their argument, Binance’s legal team also included some excerpts from a hearing held on the 13th of June. During this hearing, the SEC counsel admitted that there was no proof yet that Binance.US assets were being channeled overseas. The motion filed by the defense lawyers is part of its defense strategy in response to a lawsuit filed against Binance by the Securities and Exchange Commission on the 5th of June. The Lawsuit Against Binance The lawsuit filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission against Binance, Binance.US, and Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao accuses them of failing to register as an exchange or a broker-dealer clearing agency and offering customers unregistered securities. SEC Chair Gary Gensler also accused Binance of misleading its investors regarding their risk controls. Furthermore, the SEC also moved the court to freeze all assets belonging to Binance.US before reaching a compromise where only employees of the exchange could access client funds for the duration of the lawsuit.

The exuberant rally may now take a customary breather.  That's the message from crypto services provider Matrixport's bitcoin Greed & Fear Index (GFI), which has jumped from under 10% to 93% in roughly one week.  The index attempts to track the overriding market emotions, with above 90% readings signaling greed or excess optimism and below 10% figures representing extreme fear or pessimism.  ""Our Bitcoin Greed & Fear Index has reached exuberant levels in record time. It could be well advised to lock in some gains for short-term traders,"" Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at Matrixport, said in an email.  Historically, an above 90% reading has coincided with interim bitcoin price tops and below 10% print has presaged price rallies.  The 21-day simple moving average of the index is well short of the 90% mark, which means the overall path of least resistance for the cryptocurrency remains on the higher side.  ""The fact that the 21-day moving average (black line) is still rising could signal that bitcoin prices have more upside after the current phase of exuberant momentum is worked off with some consolidation,"" Thielen added.  Some chart analysts suggest scope for a rally to $35,000 and higher.  ""Price successfully bounced on that throwback area and completed the falling wedge setup. We have both the prior inverted head and shoulders target zone as well as the new falling wedge target zone. Additionally, we've got overhead pivot resistance around $38,000,"" market analyst Josh Olszewicz told CoinDesk.  ""So I expect prices to attempt a move towards the mid $30k range with heavy resistance and a reconsolidation before any move higher,"" Olszewicz added.  Bitcoin's pullback from the mid-April high of $31,000 to the former resistance-turned-support of $25,200 early this month represented a ""throwback"". The pattern often accelerates the price rally, as it has in the past few days.  Bitcoin changed hands at $30,065 at press time, according to CoinDesk data.  Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, has gained 15.9% since last Thursday, underperforming bitcoin by a notable margin.

In light of the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase, governments and regulatory bodies are closely monitoring the space, which could lead to potential changes in legislation or stricter regulations.

Cardano (ADA) is a notable beneficiary, showcasing a significant price increase over the past three days. ADA’s resurgence exemplifies the reversal of sentiment witnessed in the cryptocurrency market, evoking a sense of optimism reminiscent of the levels seen in March 2023. ADA’s value has surged by over 20% since reaching a low point on Monday, propelling its trading price just above $0.30. Furthermore, Cardano has surpassed a key indicator, the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA), widely used to assess a token’s short-term trend. This breakthrough is a milestone for Cardano, indicating the potential for a substantial shift in investor sentiment and paving the way for potential robust upward momentum. Related Reading: Cardano Poised For Consolidation In This Price Zone Prior To Attempting Reversal Cardano Price Surge Amidst Market Dynamics The recent upward trajectory of Cardano (ADA) can be attributed to external factors rather than token-specific developments or fundamentals. For example, the rising number of ADA wallets, as indicated by data from Cardano Blockchain Insights since late May, has not yet had an immediate impact on the token’s price. Interestingly, the current market dynamics are intertwined with a notable surge in institutional interest in Bitcoin (BTC). Last week, this heightened interest was exemplified by BlackRock’s application to launch the first United States spot BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF). As a result, Cardano’s recent rise can be seen as part of a broader market trend driven by institutional attention focused on Bitcoin. Monitoring how these external market events influence Cardano’s price and whether further developments within the crypto ecosystem will contribute to its future growth and performance is crucial. Related Reading: Investors Rush to Buy InQubeta as Price Jumps 25%, While Major Cryptos BNB and Cardano (ADA) Slump A Closer Look At Future Potential At 5:03 p.m., Cardano (ADA) is trading at $0.29, representing a 2.67% price change within the last 24 hours. This recent movement has propelled Cardano’s market capitalization to approximately $10 billion. Noteworthy is the 18.19% profit Cardano has experienced since the beginning of this year.

14107297,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=539248,1687496406,75% Of Bitcoin Holders At Spot Rates Are Making Money: Data,"Data from IntoTheBlock reveals that over 75% of all Bitcoin holders are in the money at spot rates when the prices are at multi-week highs, trading at around $30,000 as of writing on June 22. Bitcoin has been on a firm uptrend over the past few trading days, propelled by supportive fundamentals. The world’s most valuable cryptocurrency is now up roughly 22% from June 2023 and is trending above crucial resistance levels, now support. At this pace, proponents expect the coin not only to continue edging higher but break above April highs and print new 2023 highs in continuation of the bullish trend of the March to April 2023 trade range. 75% Of Bitcoin Holders Are In Green At spot rates, IntoTheBlock data shows that 75% of all BTC holders are in the money while a paltry 3% are at break even. This means these holders are not in red or green but are steady without posting any capital gains. Meanwhile, despite rapid gains in the past trading week, 22% of all BTC holders are losing money. There is a high possibility that these individuals bought their coins at recent cyclic tops, and considering the sharp drops in the past few weeks, they are still struggling to break even and are far from making profits. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Becomes 14th Largest Cryptocurrency As Bull Rally Heats Up As an illustration, while Bitcoin is at around $30,000, BTC crashed from April 2023 highs of approximately $31,000 to $24,800, a 20% drop. This followed an encouraging surge from mid-March when BTC prices rallied from $19,700 to register new 2023 highs in April, surging 56%. Notably, even at the current formation, bulls are expecting a resumption of this solid trend and a possible break above $31,000 in continuation of Q1 2023 performance. At that time, the uptick followed fears of a system-wide collapse of the banks in the United States. The collapse of the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) impacted Circle, the issuer of USDC, and forced capital to establish coins like Bitcoin. During that time, Binance also said they were converting their $1 billion Industry Recovery Fund to Bitcoin and other assets, including BNB and Ethereum, pumping these coins. The Bitcoin Run Continues Bitcoin remains supported primarily because of regulatory factors, including the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reiteration that the coin is the only commodity in the nascent sector. In their legal actions against Binance and Coinbase, the regulator alleged several top-tier altcoins, including Cardano’s ADA, as examples of unregistered securities. While these coins fell, capital flowed to Bitcoin, forcing prices higher. Related Reading: PEPE Surges By 34% Amid General Market Recovery However, the surging interest from institutions, including BlackRock and Valkyrie, and their application for a Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) have been supporting prices.

This development has bolstered the price of the popular meme coin as it continues an upward trajectory. The Shiba Inu community, affectionately known as the SHIB Army, has since been consistent in its token-burning efforts, a move that has significantly influenced the SHIB market dynamics. The burning process, which involves sending tokens to an unusable address, effectively takes them out of circulation, reducing supply and increasing scarcity. A Record Token Burn Among the transactions contributing to this burn rate, address “0xcf6” took the lead, accounting for nearly 252.8 million SHIB tokens dispatched to a dead wallet, as per data from etherscan.io. The acceleration of the token burn represents a community effort, with 341 million SHIB tokens destroyed in a mere five transactions within a single day. Related Reading: SHIB Jumps By 14% In A Single Day, As Shiba Inu “Worldpaper” Gets Closer This amount nearly equals 377 million SHIB tokens burned the previous week. Given supply and demand dynamics, this significant reduction in circulating SHIB tokens contributes to a higher token value in the long run. Notably, the impact was swiftly observed in the price of Shiba Inu, which recorded a gain of 5.6% in the past 24 hours and nearly 20% over the past seven days. The burn surge and its subsequent positive impact on the Shiba Inu price highlight the community’s power and commitment to their chosen crypto. While some critics dismiss meme coins like SHIB as lacking intrinsic value, the SHIB Army’s dedication and market dynamics seem to drive the price upward. Shiba Inu Continues Uptrend The SHIB token price has increased in the past few days, with the meme coin breaking multiple resistance levels. SHIB is trading at $0.00000791, up 19.6% over the past week. The token currently has a market capitalization of $4.6 billion, making it the 16th largest cryptocurrency by market cap. SHIB’s daily trading volume has also significantly moved in the past 7 days. Shiba Inu volume has surged from as low as $98 million last Thursday to as high as $300 million in the past 24 hours. The uptrend in the SHIB token price can be attributed to the overall bullish sentiment in the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market cap, has been in an upward trend, positively impacting the prices of other cryptocurrencies, including SHIB.

With less SHIB available, the token’s scarcity increases, theoretically increasing the token’s value over time.

The protocol upgrade, now live on Mainnet, reduces block time to roughly 3.3 seconds while maintaining instant transaction finality. This represents a more than 10 percent increase in speed and reinforces Algorand’s position as a leading blockchain platform. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Becomes 14th Largest Cryptocurrency As Bull Rally Heats Up Algorand’s Latest Protocol Upgrade Sets New Standards Algorand’s ability to instantly finalize transactions and other performance enhancements empowers Algorand-based applications to deliver a user experience comparable to traditional Web2 applications while leveraging the security and decentralization inherent in blockchain technology. The latest technical release incorporates valuable feedback from the developer community to ensure application development is faster, more accessible, and more cost-efficient. Some of the latest products and enhancements available to builders on Algorand include Simulate, a powerful simulator for smart contracts that allows developers to rigorously test, identify, and rectify any issues before deploying to Mainnet. Simulate also enables highly versatile reading of blockchain data, offering developers a clear and customizable view of the blockchain. The latest features for developers include group resource sharing for application calls, devmode timestamp control for testing Decentralized Applications (dApps), and new Algod endpoints for transaction group state updates. Conduit is another tool for flexible and lightweight data access. This technology enables developers to run their data solutions, accessing their specific data needs in a simple, flexible, and affordable manner. With these new capabilities, builders can get higher quality dApps to market faster through customized data sets and faster and more efficient testing. In a statement, Paul Riegle, Chief Product Officer at Algorand, claimed: We are hyper-focused on Algorand providing the best tech for developers to engage with and end-users to experience. Through these new capabilities, builders can get higher quality dApps to market faster through customized data sets and faster and more efficient testing. Overall, the major protocol upgrade from Algorand represents an important step forward for the blockchain platform, offering faster transaction finality and key new features for streamlined application development. With these new capabilities, Algorand is well-positioned to continue leading the way in the blockchain space and providing developers with the tools they need to build the next generation of decentralized applications. Algorand Upgrade Sparks Bull Run Hopes For ALGO According to the crypto investor and trader Zach Humphries, Layer 1 blockchains fiercely compete to attract developers and users to their ecosystems. Algorand has emerged as a strong contender with its latest protocol upgrade. This upgrade has significantly improved the platform’s speed and efficiency, making it an attractive option for developers seeking a blockchain platform that can handle high traffic volumes. Compared to Ethereum, which dominates the market, Algorand’s speed and transaction costs are significantly better. Ethereum has been plagued by network congestion and high transaction fees, making it difficult for users and developers to take full advantage of the platform. Algorand’s new protocol upgrade addresses these issues by reducing block time and making transactions faster and cheaper, thus providing a better user experience. Related Reading: Expert Analysis: IMF Documents And XC Platform Raise Concerns For XRP The positive news surrounding Algorand’s protocol upgrade has also had a bullish impact on the price of its native token, ALGO. While the token has experienced a significant downturn since reaching its annual high of $0.29858 in February, it has surged by 16% in the last seven days, reaching a current trading price of $0.12670. Despite the recent gains, ALGO still faces a resistance wall at $0.1520, which it needs to breach to continue its upward trend. If the token can overcome this resistance line, it could reach the $0.1751 and $0.20 price levels, which were lost during its downtrend.

Here’s how the 30-day price range may have foreshadowed this volatility. Bitcoin Had Earlier Compressed To A Tight 30-Day Price Range According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, tight price ranges have historically preceded large moves in the cryptocurrency’s price. In the context of the current discussion, the Bitcoin price range of interest is the 30-day one, simply a measure of the percentage difference between the top price and bottom price that the asset has observed over the last month. When the value of this metric is high, it means that the cryptocurrency has seen a significant degree of fluctuation between the high and low set during the past 30 days. Such a trend implies that the asset has registered high volatility recently. On the other hand, low values suggest the asset has only moved inside a narrow range during the past month. This kind of trend naturally highlights how stale the cryptocurrency’s price action has been lately. Related Reading: ‘Ripple (XRP) Is A Must-Hold For The Next Bull Run,’ Says Bitcoin Maxi Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin 30-day price high and low, as well as the 30-day price range, over the history of the coin: The value of the metric seems to have seen an uplift in the last few days | Source: Glassnode on Twitter As highlighted in the above graph, the Bitcoin 30-day range had compressed to a very tight range recently as the asset’s price had mostly moved sideways. During this period of consolidation, the 30-day range had fallen below the 11% mark, meaning that within 30 days, the asset’s top and bottom had only seen price action amounting to less than 11%. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Show Most Active Hour In 3 Months As BTC Breaks $30,000 In the chart, Glassnode has also marked the historical instances where the asset moved in similarly tight or tighter 30-day price ranges. Following such tight price consolidation periods, BTC has generally always observed a sudden burst of volatility. Most of the time, this volatility has been in the upwards direction, as the tight 30-day ranges have preceded many rallies in the asset. The 2021 bull run, for example, saw a similarly narrow price range in its early buildup. Though most cases may have been like this, the volatility hasn’t always been bullish. During the 2018-19 bear market, the cryptocurrency saw a long stale price action, with the 30-day price range falling to pretty low values. This stagnation finally ended up being broken by the November 2018 crash. Therefore, the recent tight range that Bitcoin had been stuck under wasn’t certain to lead to bullish volatility. But fortunately for the coin, it would appear that the narrow range has decompressed into a rally this time, as the cryptocurrency has been able to enjoy a sharp jump toward the $30,000 mark.

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was trading at $30,006, roughly flat over the past 24 hours. BTC has risen more than 12% since Tuesday when U.S. markets reopened after a long holiday weekend. Spot bitcoin ETF filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by three financial services giants, including BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, have buoyed investors who had had been reeling earlier this month when the SEC filed lawsuits against exchange powerhouses Binance and Coinbase.  Those suits continue to cloud crypto's future in the U.S., and the agency has yet to approve any of the more than half-dozen ETF applications presented in recent years, or indicate that it is ready to change its mind.  ""This is truly welcome news for the market, but perhaps not quite the beginning of the end of the bear market,"" Tim Frost, CEO of digital wealth platform Yield App, noted cautiously in an email to CoinDesk. ""This pump is likely down to a lot of institutional buying on BlackRock and other institutions’ applications for a Bitcoin spot ETF, which have not been approved. And, if these get rejected by the US SEC like all the others, this may well lead to another tumble.""  Ether, the second largest crypto in market value, was recently changing hands at $1,880, down about 1.8% from Wednesday, same time. ETH had been holding steady above $1,900 after regaining this level the previous days for the first time since the start of the month.  Other major cryptos were mixed with a few, including ADA, the token of smart contracts platform Cardano, and Litecoin up more than 2%, but others, including MATIC, the native crypto of the Polygon blockchain, off about the same. Increasingly popular memecoin PEPE was up 11%, although it had been up 70% earlier in the day. After spending most of the day in the green, the CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of crypto markets performance, sank into negative territory and was recently down 0.9%.  The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 closed up 0.8% and 0.2%, respectively, shrugging off a reiteration of hawkish remarks by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The U.S. central bank said last week that it likely would resume interest rate hikes later this year after ending a more than year-long diet of increases.  Yield App's Frost wrote that the most recent surge would ""not be particularly welcome news as this pump is entirely due to centralized institutions in traditional finance becoming more interested (in crypto).""  But he added: ""These detractors should really think about the future. Cryptocurrency cannot stay in its own echo chamber forever and it must be accepted and bought by institutions if it is to truly grow and expand.""

The institutions are taking a fresh look at crypto and they’re flooding in.  Last week, BlackRock (BLK) applied for a spot bitcoin exchange-trade fund (ETF). This week, another comically large asset manager in Invesco (IVZ) reapplied for approval to offer a spot bitcoin ETF. The less-comically large ETF-sponsor WisdomTree also refiled for a spot bitcoin product yesterday (WisdomTree’s filing was initially rejected by the SEC in 2022).  Elsewhere in non-bitcoin crypto, a crypto exchange backed by Fidelity, Schwab and Citadel Securities launched in the United States and Deutsche Bank applied for a digital asset license in Germany.  So yes, the institutions are back. But why did $10 trillion asset manager BlackRock and $1.5 trillion asset manager Invesco decide it was time for the spot bitcoin ETF again? Many have offered convoluted and tinfoil-hat theories (some which I quite like).  Theories like BlackRock is scrambling to backstop Coinbase for some reason or the big firms are acting on behalf of three letter agencies to keep self-custodied bitcoin away from everyday people or that Wall Street can’t let the crypto crowd get too far ahead of them.  There are more theories out there, but here’s a much simpler one: Financial institutions like making money and offering a spot bitcoin ETF is a way to make money.

BCH surged nearly 40% since BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF application. Surpassing the performance of BTC even as Bitcoin dominance grinds higher. Key metrics are still weak for Bitcoin Cash, and I don't see a fundamental catalyst that could be driving the recent rip higher in BCH. In the immediate sessions following BlackRock's ( BLK ) application for a spot Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) ETF, the focus has rightfully been on BTC eclipsing $30k per coin for the first time since April. The $3,000 spike in the price of bitcoin over a 48-hour period catapulted BTC dominance to about 50% - the highest level in over two years. However, even as Bitcoin dominance has surged since BlackRock's ETF application, it's actually Bitcoin Cash ( BCH-USD ) that has outperformed the market to a larger degree. Data by YCharts Since June 15th, BCH is up 34% and is one of the better performing assets in the crypto market over that time. In this article, we'll look at if there is anything fundamentally driving this price action in BCH or if it's more of a speculative frenzy. What is Bitcoin Cash? Bitcoin Cash is a hard fork of Bitcoin that enables faster and cheaper transactions than the original Bitcoin network. BCH is a product of the block size wars that occurred during the 2017 crypto bull run. Proponents of BCH, or ""big blockers,"" see the primary function of the cryptocurrency to be a peer-to-peer medium of exchange. Proponents of BTC, or ""small blockers,"" view the currency's function as more of a store of value at the base layer. This divide led to the fork. I've hypothesized that another Bitcoin block space war could be imminent in response to the Ordinals protocol. And we're already seeing signs of conflict playing out in the months since. I last covered BCH for Seeking Alpha in June 2021 . While I see certain advantages in Bitcoin Cash's base layer relative to other layer 1 payment networks, my prior concerns have been largely centered on lack of real network adoption and exchange delisting headwinds. The latter of which has proven to not manifest to the degree that I previously believed that it might. That's the good news. BCH is available on all of the major exchanges. However, the question about adoption has seemingly been answered over the last two years. There hasn't been much to speak of. Key Network Metrics I think it's crucial to understand the motivation behind forking Bitcoin to truly grasp why BCH hasn't lived up to its intended purpose. The point of the block wars was that the big blockers wanted to be able to use BCH for peer-to-peer commerce. Yet, BTC still has a drastically larger level of daily usage than BCH, both by daily active users and by USD value transferred over the network: Year To Date Daily Averages Active Users USD Transferred Value Bitcoin 930k $3.55 billion Bitcoin Cash 45k $21.2 million BTC/BCH Ratio 20.7 167.5 Source: CoinMetrics, as of 6/21/23 In 2023, Bitcoin Cash has averaged just 45k daily active users and $21 million in daily transacted value. Even during large day-to-day spikes in usage, the daily active users of BCH never sniff the DAUs of BTC. In fact, when the Ordinals transaction fee spike occurred in May and pushed users to alternative chains, it was Litecoin ( LTC-USD ) that saw the user flow, not Bitcoin Cash. DAUs (CoinMetrics) Recall that when a network is hard forked, addresses on the new chain hold the new coin when the new network goes live. For instance, if someone was holding 2 BTC before the fork, their Bitcoin Cash wallet would also hold 2 BCH on the new network. This means the fork is a good starting point for assessing wallet address growth: Non-Zero Addresses (CoinMetrics) Here, we can see that even though non-zero wallet addresses on Bitcoin Cash have grown 20% since the fork, that growth is dwarfed by the 164% growth in non-zero wallet addresses on Bitcoin. Looking at how the holder concentration breaks out also provides important context: BCH Holder Concentration (IntoTheBlock) Since the fork, BCH has seen a larger move toward whale ownership than retail ownership. This means that BCH has become more concentrated over time. This is generally not what BCH bulls or proponents of peer-to-peer payment coins would want to see. Finally, the network security story for Bitcoin Cash is not ideal. BCH Hash Rate (CoinMetrics) While Bitcoin continues to see global exahash grind higher, Bitcoin Cash hash rate peaked in 2018. This decline in mining difficulty has allowed miners to remain modestly profitable through the years, but it does diminish the theoretical security of Bitcoin Cash, as it would be easier to 51% attack BCH than it is to attack BTC. A 51% attack was actually orchestrated on Bitcoin Cash back in 2019 though that ""attack"" was said to be a pre-emptive measure to thwart the potentially malicious efforts of another entity. BCH Hash Distribution (IntoTheBlock) Today, we observe a reasonably well distributed mining pool, with no known individual pool accounting for more than 19%. By comparison, Poolin currently accounts for more than 22% of Bitcoin's mining pool hash. Main Takeaways Bitcoin Cash simply hasn't benefitted from the adoption as a medium of exchange the way early proponents of the fork likely would have wanted. There are a few different reasons for the lack of real network growth in my opinion. First, there were competing factions within the BCH community that ultimately led to yet another fork and the creation of Bitcoin Satoshi's Vision ( BSV-USD ). This further fragmented the big blocker community. And there's more competition elsewhere. In my view, Litecoin is a viable alternative to Bitcoin. The Lightning Network is certainly something that challenges the need for Bitcoin Cash, though it is admittedly cumbersome to use. And frankly, utilizing stablecoins for payments on cheap smart contract chains like Solana ( SOL-USD ) or Algorand ( ALGO-USD ) makes sense for merchants and peer to peer payments. Though there are obviously risks with fiat-collateralized stables, they do offer crypto payments in a unit of account that the masses understand. Ultimately, though, I don't see a fundamental catalyst that could to be driving the recent rip higher in BCH. I don't believe BCH is a sell. It's still profitable to mine even at current coin prices, and there are at least some people who are using it. It may never truly challenge the dominance of BTC as a true peer to peer payment instrument, but I don't think it's a terrible way to speculate on a broader crypto rally. Strictly from a user experience standpoint, it's a solid blockchain network.",NEUTRAL,BCH,BCH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | FORKS,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4613142-bitcoin-cash-what-is-going-on-with-this-rally?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/14099964.jpeg

The largest cryptocurrency in the market has again become the center of attention, with investors expecting more upside movements soon. However, BTC recently stopped its uptrend and presented a minor pullback below the $30,000 level. For the cryptocurrency to expect future growth and continuous breach of higher levels to mark new annual highs, it must consolidate above this mark. Related Reading: SHIB Jumps By 14% In A Single Day, As Shiba Inu “Worldpaper” Gets Closer Bitcoin Nears Liquidation Levels Of Short Sellers The Wolf of Few Streets, a popular cryptocurrency trader, has recently shared his insights on the current state of the Bitcoin market. According to him, the resistance level for Bitcoin is currently at $31,000, and the bulls are expected to test it soon. Additionally, the main liquidation levels of short sellers are at $31,500 and $32,000, and BTC is just slightly away from reaching them. Despite the recent volatility in the cryptocurrency market, The Wolf of Few Streets remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s future. He notes fundamental positivity in the market, with institutional investors showing an increased interest in the digital asset. However, The Wolf of Few Streets also cautions that a minor correction may happen after BTC touches one of these resistance levels. He advises investors to be cautious and closely monitor the market for potential changes. Overall, The Wolf of Few Streets’ insights suggests that the Bitcoin market is currently in flux, with bullish investors hoping for further growth and short sellers waiting for the right moment to sell. It remains to be seen whether BTC will be trapped in the $29,000 and $30,000 range for a while before attempting to breach higher resistances. BTC’s 200-Week MA/EMA Support Holds Steady Bitcoin has been experiencing a surge in price recently, with the cryptocurrency market showing renewed interest in the digital asset. Market analysts such as Michael Van de Poppe have noted that this surge is likely the first real impulse in this cycle, indicating that Bitcoin may enter a new growth phase. Van de Poppe has also noted that the 200-Week Moving Average (MA) and Exponential Moving Average (EMA) have supported Bitcoin’s price, indicating that the digital asset may be on a steady upward trajectory. The market sentiment is positive, and institutional investors have shown increased interest in Bitcoin, a positive sign for its future growth. Related Reading: PEPE Surges By 34% Amid General Market Recovery However, Van de Poppe also cautions that a correction may be on the horizon after BTC reaches the $38,000-$42,000 range.
