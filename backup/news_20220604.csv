In the past 6 months, the price of Bitcoin dropped from an all-time high of $69,000 to its current levels of around $30,000. In the short term, the pain has been more pronounced with Bitcoin recording 9 consecutive weeks in the red. McGlone believes the cryptocurrency and other risk-on assets are responding to the current macro-economic outlook. The crypto market has experienced some of the best performance in global markets. The rally in the nascent asset class usually corresponds to 4 years cycles with parabolic bull runs followed by multi-year bear markets. Many in the sector believe cryptocurrencies entered their bear phase or the &apos;Crypto Winter&apos;. The losses have been compounded by two factors: the beginning of economic tightening measures by the U.S. Federal Reserve, and the collapse of the Terra ecosystem.

42374463,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvZVoZ,1654377076,Yuga Labs Confirms Discord Server Hack; 200 ETH Worth of NFTs Stolen,"The Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) Discord server was hacked Saturday, with the attacker making off with 200 ETH ($360,000) worth of non-fungible tokens (NFT), according to Yuga Labs.  The hack took place after the project’s community manager, Boris Vagner, had his Discord account compromised, which the attacker then used to post phishing links in both the official BAYC and its related metaverse project called Otherside’s Discord channels.  News of the hack was first reported by Twitter user NFTherder, who also estimates 145 ETH (around $260,000) was stolen along with the NFTs, tracing the stolen funds back to four separate wallets.  Yuga Labs later confirmed the exploit occurred in a tweet of its own, saying it is still actively investigating the incident. It did so 11 hours after NFTHerder's tweet.  Vagner ​​is also the manager of his brother, the Grammy-winning multi-instrumentalist Richard Vagner, who co-founded an NFT fantasy football club called Spoiled Banana Society (SPS) with Boris. The attacker posted a phishing link in the SPS Discord channel, though the message was subsequently deleted, Richard said.  ""Hey @everyone we were hacked an hour ago hopefully no one clicked any links,” Richard Vagner said in a Discord message at 09:00 UTC. “We’ve got back control of the discord and Boris’s account thank god he didn’t delete the whole server.”  It is unclear if anyone in the SBS channel was affected, though Richard has requested information from the Discord members related to the attack.  “We’ll be getting all the tabs back up in the following days & let us know if there’s anything else he messed with,” he said.  The Vagners also run a record label called Metaverse Records. In the same SBS Discord message, Richard independently confirmed that the BAYC and Otherside Discords were also “hacked.”  “Pls stay safe,” he wrote.  This is the third time a bad actor has been able to impersonate a Yuga Labs-run account to steal users’ funds. The first was April 1 when Mutant Ape Yacht Club #8662 was stolen through a phishing link posted in the project’s Discord, with the second coming April 25 after Bored Ape Yacht Club Instagram and Discord accounts posted a fake link to an Otherside minting.  Last week, actor Seth Green became a prominent example of the type of phishing schemes that run rampant in the NFT sector, when someone successfully scammed him out of his Bored Ape.  In response to the incident Saturday, one BAYC founder blamed Discord for the lapse in security.  ""Discord isn't working for Web 3 communities,"" Gordon Goner said in a tweet. ""We need a better platform that puts security first.""  However, another crypto project founder blamed the users themselves for compromising their wallets.  ""You lost your NFT because you signed a malicious transaction with your key,"" Steve Fink wrote. ""Stop blaming Discord, another client won't save you from repeating the same mistakes.""

Julie Fredrickson is a managing partner at Chaotic Capital. This article is a preview of the talk she will give on the Big Ideas stage at Consensus 2022 in Austin, Texas, next week. Follow her on Twitter: @AlmostMedia. Register for Consensus 2022 here.  What is a DAO?  Defined as organizations managed by votes on a blockchain, DAOs offer us a shift toward open and inclusionary legal entities for marshaling resources and energy across massively dispersed groups, raising the question: Could we be at the beginning of a multi-decade inDAOstrial revolution?  To understand why I think DAOs have such significant potential, it is helpful to dive into the history of the corporate form that helped lay the groundwork for the Industrial Revolution and, in particular, the role corporations played in the foundation of the first corporate country: America.  The American example  While I’m not a historian, I think one can make the case that America had corporate governance before we had a functional state. According to the ""Brief History of the Corporate Form and Why It Matters"" published by Fordham University’s School of Law, in America the corporation came before the colonial legislatures:  “Notable ‘joint-stock’ companies, such as the Virginia Company, helped expand British control of North America. In fact, the Virginia Company established the General Assembly, which was the first legislature in North America.”  Think about that for a moment. A monarchy set a corporate charter to extract commodities. At first blush it is normal colonial mercantilism. But that corporate organization helped lead to a 300-year experiment in democratic self-governance. DAOs driving a revolution suddenly doesn’t seem so far-fetched, does it? Our entire political way of life is downstream of a monarchal charter for a corporation’s property rights.  And this makes sense; after all, society is driven by how we organize and govern our resources and at what scale. When trying to build something more complex than an agricultural society, the ability to trust that your goals and investments will be executed, even if you are not personally overseeing them, is a key catalyst for all other technologies. The more efficient we are at marshaling and deploying resources at scale, the further we get as a civilization.  But even today, the corporation still relies heavily on trust. A country’s economic power is correlated to the strength and development of its legal and financial systems, which is why we’ve gone on to establish elaborate judicial processes to insure institutional trust as we moved away from “God-given” rights to a system governed by laws. The original version of this took several hundred years from commodity extraction to Silicon Valley. But now we are at an impasse when it comes to institutional trust and large-scale coordination.  DAOs and the network state  DAOs ask us to consider if it is possible to further abstract our trust away from fallible humans. The trustless nature of DAOs could help us unlock more sophisticated financing that enables ever-further scale and coordination. If the corporation created America, can the DAO lead to the formation of other new nation-states? Could it lead to the creation of a network state wherein a social network eventually coalesces into a physical state?  According to angel investor Balaji Srinivasan, “a network state is … an archipelago of digitally-linked, interconnected enclaves,” meaning a nation-state could be made up of globally scattered, networked real estate operated and owned by a group of citizens using the DAO structure for governance. The closest metaphor we have currently are corporate campuses or co-working locations.  Read More: Consensus 2022 Speaker Profile: Balaji Srinivasan  Imagine a network state made up of independent and supporting sub-DAOs that together provide interlocking economies. Some DAOs are responsible for infrastructure. Others are for services like police or firemen. Maybe several network states share key services, perhaps even allowing an oligopoly for key social needs like health care. The more something needs extensive scale to succeed, the more large-scale trustless collaborative behavior gets rewarded. I don’t doubt we can create some truly dystopian nightmares in this type of experiment, but wouldn’t it be wild if DAOs are what gets us health care for all?  Decentralized autonomous organizations offer us a new path for how we can pool different kinds of resources including, but not limited to, virtual ones. DAOs give humans a chance to build bigger, weirder things on totally radical timelines just like the advent of the corporation paved the way for the Industrial Revolution. It is a new way of looking at wealth, power and cultural mores.  DAOs and social change  A society-level trustless entity means no more kings or “great men'' who safeguard corporate charters. We’d be trusting a series of legal codes and judicial norms that happen to be legible as executable computer code. A smart contract is still a contract. It is just a (theoretically) more efficient, self-executing version of standard corporate governance norms.  This vision is still aspirational because unlike with standard corporate governance, best practices are still being established. You can see these growing pains going back to The DAO, which famously resulted in a hard fork of Ethereum in 2016 to overcome an attack on the smart contract. America now has several centuries of corporate law to help resolve disputes whereas DAOs haven’t quite reached the decade mark yet. There is much work to be done on best practices.  Read more: 'Will ETH Survive?': Why Ethereum's Leaders Forked the Network in 2016  I recently watched “The Gilded Age” television series because I’m a sucker for set pieces, but what I found was a story about changing expectations of who decides how we organize civilization's spoils. The real-life Gilded Age marked the apex of the Industrial Revolution and provides an instructive history for those curious about how innovation cycles play out. This is a tale that gets retold but with new tools at each new innovation cycle in our history. I believe we are still in the “installation” phase of economic historian Carlotta Perez's Technical Surge Cycle. If we are lucky, the current crypto bear market might be the crash that puts us on the path to deployment and eventually maturity.  Perhaps DAOs have the chance to unlock new norms that are just as unsettling and ultimately wealth-creating as anything we saw in the Gilded Age and Industrial Revolution. They say history doesn’t repeat but it rhymes. I don’t doubt the changes we see to cultural norms over the next century will be every bit as revolutionary as the founding of America.  We are at a turning point for how to properly organize individuals, and citizens. It's entirely possible something as arcane and mundane as automated corporate governance might be the fulcrum on which the next revolution turns.

The human brain evolved to forecast.  Born into a world of uncertainty, early humans had to manage threats, weather and food sources to survive. Evolution has ensured that humans are good at this and further that we enjoy it.  Today, we grapple with similar issues. Will monkeypox be a serious pandemic? Will Russia and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization directly engage? China-Taiwan? Climate change? Global food supply?  It is impossible to answer these questions in advance. The future is uncertain, and the systems these questions deal with are too complex and interdependent for total foresight. But this doesn’t preclude patterns. And as a result, we can generate reliable, partial foresight. You cannot definitely say if a parent is angry or disappointed when they call for you, but hearing your full name is one heck of a signal. By investigating patterns based on the accumulation of experiences and knowledge, humans have developed frameworks to quantify uncertainty and predict.  Clay Graubard and Andrew Eaddy are the founders of Baserate.io, the publisher of Global Guessing, a geopolitical forecasting site, and Crowd Money, a newsletter and podcast about prediction markets. This article is a preview of a talk they will give next week on the Big Ideas stage at Consensus 2022 in Austin, Texas.  Weather forecasting, once thought to be futile despite milenia of practice, is reliably wrong enough to trust. You won’t know at 8 a.m. whether it will rain at 2 p.m., but advances in meteorology have enabled the Dark Sky app to predict a 24% chance. Sure, unlikely. But in 2016 Nate Silver gave former U.S. President Donald Trump a 28.2% chance to be elected president, and so it is probably wise to take an umbrella.  In the social sciences, we’ve identified that two democracies are less likely to go to war with one another than other combinations of states, that crimes are more likely to occur in neighborhoods with “broken windows,” that civil wars are nearly twice as likely in countries with gross domestic product per capita of $250 as in those at $500 (15% versus 8%).  Barring belief in preordination, we live in a probabilistic world. Forecasting is something we all do, whether or not we know it. It is a tool, it is a process, and critically, it is a skill to generate information. Thankfully, it is a skill we can improve and get good at.  That, in essence, is the core takeaway from the research of Philip E. Tetlock, Barbara Mellers and many others. Their research has shown that if we quantify, record, update, score and practice, we can make accurate predictions on complex questions. We can see at least part way through the “fog of war.”  This is why we should pay attention when forecasters say there is a 28% chance the World Health Organization declares monkeypox a public health emergency of international concern. Or a 10% chance there is direct Russia-NATO conflict before July 2023 and a 15% chance of a China-Taiwan war before 2024. Etc. Etc.  This is also why we should be surprised, and even take issue, with how little attention and funding forecasting receives.  Read More: Consensus 2022 Speaker Profile: Clay Graubard  Forecasting produces good information, forces accountability (you cannot brush aside a track record!) and rejects sophistry, sensationalism and biased thinking. It is a perfect check on traditional media outlets and a potential antidote to polarization. One cannot forecast while ignoring an important perspective. Otherwise, accuracy suffers. This is perhaps why forecasters have been found to be less politically polarized than non-forecasters.  Unfortunately, having value doesn’t guarantee immediate, or even relatively timely, widespread use. History is replete with such examples, including even more obvious things such as seat belts. Forecasting is an inherently disruptive practice, making corporate adoption challenging.  Forecasting is also difficult, time consuming and (for now) underpaid (trust us). Adoption will require many approaches, and we believe prediction markets are one of the most hopeful by bringing monetary and psychological incentives and market efficiencies into the forecasting process.  What are prediction markets?  Prediction markets are not new. Individuals have made bets on the future outcome of events since ancient times. And the coined phrase “the wisdom of crowds” can be traced back to early 20th-century England.  In 1906-1907, Sir Francis Galton, a scientist and mathematician from Birmingham and relative of Darwin, witnessed a competition in which roughly 800 villagers in Plymouth, England were challenged to estimate the weight of an ox. While each individual estimate was too high or too low, Galton observed that the median was within 0.8% of the weight measured by the competition’s judges. The mean estimate was exactly right.  Prediction markets are marketplaces where participants trade on future outcomes about particular topics. Think of the stock or crypto markets, but dealing with events.  Prediction markets are typically binary, offering two fungible assets for a given market (think “Yes” or “No”). These assets trade between 0% and 100% (think $0 to $1), with the current market price representing the crowd consensus.  When a forecasted event occurs, traders who purchased shares of the correct outcome are paid $1 for each share that they owned. Similar to long-established public equities markets, the primary incentive for participants in prediction markets is profit, while the byproduct of their forecasting activity is information.  Read More: Consensus 2022 Speaker Profile: Andrew Eaddy  But while traditional prediction markets often function as described above, it is important to contextualize this technology within the larger ecosystem of prediction platforms that use different methods to elicit predictions. There are prediction markets that use real or play money. (Among the real money platforms, some place bets in fiat, others in crypto.)  Other platforms like Metaculus use a poll-based method where people continually give their subjective probability assessments of a question. Many of these platforms incentivize reputation, community and other factors to further generate high-quality information.  One benefit of prediction markets over other methods is that, all else being equal, they generate more accurate forecasts than traditional prediction platforms (or polls) such as Good Judgment Open. The forecasts they produce are less biased, less noisy and more informed.  Another benefit is that betting makes things more exciting, and often increases engagement, not only on hot topics such as sports, but on other important and yet neglected ones like the risks to humanity from artificial intelligence. And given that individuals can produce consistently accurate and well-calibrated forecasts, there is an opportunity for smart traders and elite forecasters to generate reliable returns—particularly because returns for accuracy can compound over time.  Prediction markets today  Writ large, modern-day prediction markets continue to build on this finding, creating more efficient and replicable means of aggregating predictions to produce accurate information. Within the ecosystem, however, there are different categories and classifications for prediction market platforms.  Some prediction markets, like Kalshi, are centralized and use U.S. dollars to support trading. Others, like Polymarket, are partially decentralized and trade using the stablecoin USDC. And still others, like Augur, are fully decentralized, complete with decentralized oracles to facilitate decentralized question resolution.  There are differences between prediction markets related to their stated purpose as well. For example, Google has been using prediction markets internally to improve business decisions and understand employee sentiment since 2008. The incentive structure and functionality of a prediction market like Google’s will understandably diverge from those of a publicly accessible prediction market.  Finally, there are differences in prediction markets’ technical functionality, as well. Some prediction market platforms, namely those on blockchains, use automated market makers (AMMs) to provide liquidity. Other platforms use a more traditional order book-based trading system.  AMMs provide consistent liquidity to a market and often result in a more positive trading experience for market participants, but if liquidity dries up, slippage can occur, meaning that order sizes can affect order prices, which isn’t good. Order book trading, on the other hand, is much simpler. A trading screen displays a selection of buy orders and sell orders for an asset at various prices. As a trader, you can fill any order in the book.  Prediction markets tomorrow  Aside from enhancing the accuracy of forecasts and boosting engagement, prediction markets can help reform the media, drive community on social media and inform key decision makers in the private and public sectors through systems such as Robin Hanson’s Futarchy depicted below.  Such a system would reward thoughtful and involved citizens. It would also incentivize good decision making because even if you pick the “correct” and implemented policy, to win money, it has to work. Over time, bad forecasters would be weeded out. Through Futarchy, prediction markets can support fundamental and vital values within a healthy society, namely information (through forecasting), governance (through Futarchy) and institutions (prediction markets).  Read More: Polymarket’s CFTC Fine Hints at DeFi Regulation Roadmap  Even short of Futarchy, prediction markets have the potential to transform today’s political process by involving people in the conversation and delivering more reliable information about the future.  We live in uncertain and complex worlds. Critical thinking and reliable information are required when making good decisions. Quantified forecasting is an invaluable and yet underused tool, and prediction markets appear a vital tool for its adoption. We at baserate.io believe this needs to happen sooner rather than later, because even certainties such as death may now be uncertain.

42415426,U2msve444uc2I0ChHDVhK3,1654347600,Inside the Environmentalist Campaign to Change Bitcoin’s Code,"When environmentalist groups in March unveiled a campaign to move Bitcoin’s code away from the energy-intensive proof-of-work (PoW) model, many bitcoiners scoffed at the idea.  Setting aside the question of whether proof-of-work mining is the environmental peril the activists claim it is, many cryptocurrency veterans doubt the strategy could work.  That strategy hinges on persuading a limited number of firms or people who, the campaigners claim, have the power to make the change or at least convince a critical mass of people to support it.  To old hands, this plan seems ignorant of Bitcoin’s history – specifically the block size wars of 2015-2017, including the debate over the Segregated Witness (SegWit) upgrade, in which one of two proposed alterations pushed by the biggest companies failed in the face of widespread user opposition.  The leaders of the campaign to “Change the code, not the climate” say they are aware of this history and even take it as a sign that change is indeed possible.  Interpreting Bitcoin history  The block size wars and the SegWit update “serve as a case in point” to show that “changes can be made,” Faber, senior vice president, Government Affairs at Environmental Working Group (EWG), one of the groups spearheading the campaign, told CoinDesk. Whether these changes come as “a hard fork or a soft fork,” they can indeed be made “when there's general consensus within the Bitcoin community,” he said.  Read more: What is SegWit?  Rolf Skar is a special projects manager at Greenpeace USA, an environmental protection organization that is part of the campaign. According to Skar, there are two key questions as to whether the network can change; first, whether it is technically feasible. The 2017 SegWit update “shows that it is, quite obviously, technically feasible to do so,” Skar said to CoinDesk. But, he added, the second question is “whether a proposed change could be supported enough to be adopted.”  “Despite skepticism,” the campaigners don’t see a good reason why enough support will not be eventually garnered, said Skar. “Solutions will need to be developed and tested to address valid concerns of the community. If effective solutions are not developed we understand that uptake of new code would be unlikely,” Skar said.  Considering how industries have scoffed at other environmental campaigns, such as electric trucks, which were initially ridiculed but then sales soared, a change away from PoW may not seem so impossible, according to the campaigners.  Ken Cook, founder and CEO of EWG, said that, based on his conversations with various insiders within the Bitcoin industry, he thinks Bitcoin’s governance has changed, such that there is now an “inexorable concentration of power and control.”  The “notion that this was as democratic as it was originally conceived is gone,” he said.  Skar similarly said of Bitcoin in an interview: “Although it's a decentralized system, there are key players within it.”  EWG’s Cook pointed to an October 2021 paper from the U.S. National Bureau of Economic Research, which found, “The top 50% of miners control almost all mining capacity. Top 10% control 90% and just 0.1% control close to 50%” and that “the largest 55-60 miners controlled at least half of all bitcoin mining capacity.”  Faber said that he doesn’t think the decision will literally be made by 50 people, but if leaders in the Bitcoin community “raise their voices, they can help start the conversation that could ultimately lead to the changes needed.”  Who controls Bitcoin?  A debate around how to improve the Bitcoin network’s scalability picked up steam in 2015. Some developers and stakeholders called for an increase to the size of blocks, whereas others thought that would harm decentralization.  After two years of controversy, an update to the Bitcoin network called Segregated Witness (SegWit) was adopted through a soft fork, meaning users could still keep running the old version of the software. SegWit increased the number of transactions the network could handle by changing the way data is stored on the chain. Unlike other proposals to increase the block size, SegWit enjoyed widespread user support.  Around the same time, another proposal to increase the block size met the opposite fate. An agreement was signed by 58 companies, representing 83.28% of the network’s computing power, in New York at CoinDesk’s 2017 Consensus conference. The agreement called for a doubling of Bitcoin’s maximum block size to two megabytes. Four of the companies were directly involved in mining, one of them being CoinDesk’s parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), which also owns U.S. miner Foundry. Another seven signatories were mining pools.  But, six months later, the supposedly powerful signatories backed down and called off the hard fork, or backward-incompatible code change, citing lack of sufficient consensus. Some big-block supporters started a splinter network called Bitcoin Cash.  Asked about the controversy around block sizes and the fact that some changes were never implemented, Skar said that “five years is a long time in Bitcoin’s relatively short history. Things are different now, as are the issues at hand.” It’s up to the people and players in the Bitcoin social ecosystem to determine how change will occur, he said.  SegWit was implemented because the Bitcoin community understood it was key to the network’s success, Faber said. Now, Bitcoin faces another threat: regulation, according to the EWG vice president.  For now, “the decision about how to reduce the electricity used by PoW and the resulting climate pollution is in the hands of the Bitcoin community. But only for the moment. Regulators are not going to stand by as the climate crisis grows worse and worse and digital currencies like bitcoin use more and more electricity, and produce more and more greenhouse gas emissions,” Faber said.  The challenge of changing Bitcoin by consensus  Even if it were possible, implementing a change to the protocol is not the whole story. Jonas Nick, a Bitcoin developer with Blockstream who was involved in another major protocol update that was implemented last year, known as Taproot, said that achieving a “rough community consensus” was an important step for the upgrade to be implemented.  But the key to changing Bitcoin is to convince “an overwhelming majority of economic activity on Bitcoin to use” the new code, Nick said. “You can always change the rules of chess, but you may have to play alone,” the developer said.  One measure of bitcoin’s decentralization is the number of reachable nodes that comprise the Bitcoin network. Since the end of 2017, the number of reachable Bitcoin nodes has increased by 27.5%. The blocksize wars indicated that users control the direction of the protocol, which means that more coordination is needed to be undertaken to make wholesale changes to the network.  Asked whether shifting Bitcoin away from PoW is possible, Nick said that the consensus in the Bitcoin community is that PoW “is the only known consensus algorithm that can power a decentralized currency.”  Read more: Taproot, Bitcoin’s Long-Anticipated Upgrade, Has Activated  Andrew M. Bailey, who teaches about cryptocurrencies at the joint Yale-National University of Singapore College, said that “people have tried to switch Bitcoin through various forks, but the value of these tokens tends to sink “very, very quickly.”  “What that suggests is that the vast majority of Bitcoiners are just going to sell their forked proof-of-stake coin” and that “the only way to make it happen is actually to get social consensus” from the entire community, he said.  Bailey thinks that this consensus is “extraordinarily unlikely because Bitcoin has this conservative development culture,” which makes changes slowly and only when the community is absolutely certain about their effects.

If parties involved in existing deals want to proceed, they’re going to need to reprice them to reflect current market comps, Peter Stoneberg, managing director at M&A firm Architect Partners, told CoinDesk. “SPACs overall have been very volatile and on a downward trajectory,” Stoneberg said.  Last Wednesday, media outlet Forbes scrapped its plans to go public via a SPAC at a $630 million valuation through a merger with Hong Kong-based Magnum Opus Acquisition Ltd. (OPA). Crypto exchange Binance had previously provided a $200 million strategic investment in Forbes in conjunction with the proposed deal.  Regulation  To enhance investor protection, the SEC recently said that it would propose “specialized disclosure requirements with respect to, among other things, compensation paid to sponsors, conflicts of interest, dilution, and the fairness of these business combination transactions.”  The SEC’s report noted that SPACs nearly doubled the amount they raised from over $83 billion in such offerings in 2020 to more than $160 billion last year. The SEC added that in those years over half of all initial public offerings were conducted using a SPAC.  Stoneberg noted headwinds for SPAC participants. The SEC is now being more cautious on the overall SPAC process, particularly crypto-linked deals, he added.  Crypto miners and capital  Cryptocurrency miners require plenty of capital for data centers and rigs, but capital is scarce now, Stoneberg said.  “There’s not a lot of capital out there for mining companies right now or for SPACs,” he said. The private investment in the public equity (PIPE) market was “very active, but today it's pretty much dead.”  Here are crypto SPAC deals investors are watching:  Circle, the backer of the USDC stablecoin, and its combination with Concord Acquisition Corp. (CND). The parties reached a new agreement with an initial outside date of Dec. 8, with the potential to extend to Jan. 31, 2023, under “certain circumstances.”  Miner PrimeBlock with 10X Capital Venture Acquisition Corp. II (VCXA), in a deal expected to close in the second half of the year.  Miner Bitdeer and Blue Safari Group Acquisition Corp. (BSGA), in a deal that was recently extended.  Bitmain-backed miner BitFuFu and Arisz Acquisition Corp. (ARIZ), which is expected to list on the Nasdaq in Q3.  Miner Griid Infrastructure and Adit EdTech Acquisition Corp. (ADEX), originally expected to close in Q1.  Coincheck, one of Japan's largest crypto exchanges, with Thunder Bridge Capital Partners IV. The deal is expected to be completed in the second half of this year.  Investing platform eToro Group and FinTech Acquisition Corp. V (FTCV). The deal has a June 30 termination date.

Crypto Romance Scams On The Rise &apos;Pig Slaughtering&apos; is a term used for scams where an individual or a group takes time to build a fake relationship with a victim, often putting in weeks or months of regular engagement with the target. The scammer then convinces the victim to invest in cryptocurrencies, usually through a duplicate version of a real crypto platform or by convincing them to send funds to a wallet address. The relationship is akin to &apos;fattening&apos; up a victim before the person is looted, just like a pig is &apos;fattened up&apos; before it gets butchered. One of the victims, who preferred to be identified as Cy, lost $1.2 million after two months of having an online relationship with the scammer. Another example is the case of R where the scammer worked with her for a month before convincing her to send funds to a crypto website, thereby losing $1.3 million. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) previously sent out a warning over crypto- &apos;pig slaughtering&apos; romance scams in April, pointing out that over 4,300 complaints were received by its Internet Crime Complaint Center last year, with total losses reported to be over $429 million.

The coin is up eight percent versus the USDT and roughly 11 percent against BTC and ETH. Its price is retesting a critical resistance level at $0.58. It marks the December 2020 lows. Depending on the reaction at present levels, the token&apos;s bulls could break out to register higher highs or recoil in a retest. SXP Technical Analysis From the daily chart, buyers are in the driving seat. Bull bars are beginning to band along the upper BB, suggesting upside momentum.

34533,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=492150,1654304442,"Solana Below $40 Amidst Network Outage, Are The Bears Back?","Solana is on a downtrend currently, price of the altcoin has slid below the vital support line of $40. This downslide comes in the middle of a network outage, yet again! A software glitch was responsible for causing an outage that lasted over 4 hours. Solana had also experienced another major outage in the month of January which stretched over 18 hours. This has apparently affected the Solana ecosystem as constant outages causes traders to lose their portfolio value simultaneously. Over the last 24 hours, the altcoin lost about 6.4% of its value. In the last week, SOL depreciated over 12%. After a period of consolidation, SOL attempted to rise but the bears came back soon after. Right after the altcoin lost its critical support of $50, it has been constantly value ever since. Buying strength has also dropped owing to the recent downtrend. Solana Price Analysis: One Day Chart SOL was trading at $38 at the time of writing. It lost its crucial support of $40 and was on a downtrend. If SOL does not manage to stay at its current price level, it might aim for $34. The coin touched these price levels last at the month of August 2021. The descending trendline (yellow) agrees with downtrend in the market. For the bulls to accumulate in order to invalidate the bearish thesis, the coin has to attempt for $50. The volume of the coin traded had declined and was in the red. This reading signified bearish dominance in the market.

42374434,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvZVeV,1654303378,Coinbase’s Abrupt Hiring Reversal Blindsided Would-Be Employees,"Would-be Coinbase employees have been left in the lurch after the crypto exchange announced it would rescind job offers as part of a swathe of cost-cutting measures in a bear market.  CoinDesk spoke to three such recruits who said they felt blindsided by the sudden reversal from the company they’d assumed was the most stable brand in crypto – a place worth picking over Snap, Meta, Roblox or other tech giants. One software engineer, a recent college graduate, said they passed up offers from all three to work instead of at Coinbase.  Another software engineer who said he signed his Coinbase Cloud offer in mid-May was days away from leaving his job on Wall Street: He was at a going-away happy hour with work friends when the rescission email hit. Now, he’s staying put.  Many of the potentially hundreds of downturned prospects weren’t so lucky. The college grad was planning on starting in September.  “Now I’m scrambling to get something, and most companies are either filled up or frozen hiring,” the grad said.  Coinbase announced earlier this year it intended to triple its headcount through the end of 2022. One of the recruits CoinDesk spoke to said he believed a few hundred people may have been in the recruitment and onboarding process this week.  On Thursday, Coinbase Chief People Officer L.J. Brock announced that the company would “rescind a number of accepted offers.” And it appears to have wasted no time in doing so.  Several almost-hires posted to the Blind jobs posting forum noting that they left their old roles, or turned down other offers, to take on roles at Coinbase, which announced two weeks ago it would slow its hiring process. One individual said they were a new graduate who interviewed in November.  According to a copy of an email sent to this person from Brock, they will receive one month’s salary as severance.  Other users said their start date was meant to be June 6, just four days after Brock’s blog post.
