42402449,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdJruj,1547593725,Ethereum Clients Release New Software In Wake of Hard Fork Delay,"Major ethereum clients, including Go-Ethereum (Geth) and Parity, have released software updates following an earlier decision to delay the planned system-wide upgrade dubbed Constantinople.  The upgrade was postponed Tuesday during a developers call, a move that came after blockchain audit firm Chain Security discovered a security vulnerability in Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1283, one of the planned changes included in Constantinople. If exploited, the bug would have allowed for ""reentrance attacks,"" allowing malicious actors to withdraw funds from the same source multiple times.  A new activation block for the upgrade will be decided during another call later this week.  In order to prevent the fork from happening – given that some of the software clients on the network had already been updated ahead of the fork – developers of the major ethereum implementations moved to publish new versions.  Geth released an emergency hotfix (version 1.8.21) designed to delay the upgrade, though developer Péter Szilágyi noted that users who do not wish to upgrade to the new version of the client can also downgrade their existing clients to version 1.8.19 or continue running the current version (1.8.20) with an override.  Parity clients can similarly either upgrade their existing clients to 2.2.7 (the stable release) or 2.3.0 (a beta release) or otherwise downgrade to 2.2.4 (beta).  Parity Technologies head of security Kirill Pimenov, speaking in an ethereum core developers chat on Gitter, said he recommended users upgrade to the new release, rather than downgrade to an older version, explaining:  ""I want to restate — downgrading Parity to pre-Constantinople versions is a bad idea, we don't recommend that to anyone. Theoretically it should even work, but we don't want to deal with that mess.""  Similarly, Parity release manager Afri Schoedon told CoinDesk that he recommends 2.2.7, though the other two should work as well.  In a blog post, core developer Hudson Jameson wrote that anyone who does not run a node or otherwise participate in the network does not need to do anything.  Smart contract owners do not need to do anything either, though ""you may choose to examine the analysis of the potential vulnerability and check your contracts,"" he wrote.  However, he pointed out that the change that could introduce the potential issue will not be enabled.  As of the blog post’s publication, security researchers with ChainSecurity, who initially discovered the bug, and TrailOfBits are analyzing the overall blockchain.  Reentrance attacks  So far, no instances of the vulnerability have been discovered in live contracts. However, Jameson noted that ""there is still a non-zero risk that some contracts could be affected.""  In order for transfers on ethereum to avoid reentrance attacks, a small amount of ether called gas is paid which prevents attackers from repurposing a transfer to steal funds.  However, as explained to CoinDesk by Hubert Ritzdorf – the individual who found the vulnerability and CTO of Chain Security – a ""side effect"" of EIP 1283 ensures attackers can leverage this small amount of gas for malicious purposes.  ""The difference is before you couldn’t do something malicious with this little bit of gas, you could do something useful but not something malicious and now because some of the operations became cheaper, now you can do something malicious with this little bit of gas,"" said Ritzdorf.  And though the issue of reentrancy is always on the minds of smart contract developers coding in Solidity on ethereum, Matthias Egli – COO of Chain Security – explained that core developers strictly looking at the mechanics of the virtual machine couldn’t have easily spotted this vulnerability.  He told CoinDesk:  ""It’s a Solidity thing, it’s not an [ethereum virtual machine] core thing that in practice allowed this attack. That was part of this disconnect that in practice small changes to gas cost will allow new kind of attacks which wasn’t considered before.""  What’s more, Ritzdorf added that the fix to this issue isn’t as easy as updating ethereum’s gas cost limits, explaining that ""if we change this amount to a small number now then we would fix the vulnerability but we would also break many existing [smart] contracts.""  As such, for the time being, a delay to Constantinople was the right call by core developers according to Egli.  ""It was the right decision because it at least buys some time for researchers to evaluate the real world impact. With high likelihood, this [EIP] will be taken back and not included in the upcoming hard fork which is now delayed by perhaps a month,"" he contended.  Next steps  As of press time, developers are contacting exchanges, wallets, mining pools and other groups which use or interact with the ethereum network.  Core developers plan to discuss longer-term steps – including when to execute Constantinople and how to fix the bug in EIP 1283 – during another call on Jan. 18.  Multiple developers suggested initiating some sort of bug bounty program focused on analyzing the code, in order to ensure future bugs are discovered well in advance, rather than ""right before [hard fork] day.""  Szilágyi noted that the EIP had been available for review for nearly a year, adding that ""maybe it’s not a bad idea to do some grants for more focused eyes.""

42402454,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdJrxg,1547583570,Ethereum's Constantinople Upgrade Faces Delay Due to Security Vulnerability,"Ethereum’s long-anticipated Constantinople upgrade has just been delayed after a critical vulnerability was discovered in one of the planned changes.  Smart contract audit firm ChainSecurity flagged Tuesday that Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1283, if implemented, could provide attackers a loophole in the code to steal user funds. Speaking on a call, ethereum developers, as well as developers of clients and other projects running the network, agreed to delay the hard fork – at least temporarily – while they assessed the issue.  Participants included ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin, developers Hudson Jameson, Nick Johnson and Evan Van Ness, and Parity release manager Afri Schoedon, among others. A new fork date will be decided during another ethereum dev call on Friday.  Discussing the vulnerability online, the project's core developers reached the conclusion that it would take too long to fix the bug prior to the hard fork, which was expected to execute at around 04:00 UTC on Jan. 17.  Called a reentrancy attack, the vulnerability essentially allows an attacker to ""reenter"" the same function multiple times without updating the user about the state of affairs. Under this scenario, an attacker could essentially be “withdrawing funds forever,” said Joanes Espanol, CTO of blockchain analytics firm Amberdata in a previous interview with CoinDesk.  He explained:  ""Imagine that my contract has a function which makes a call to another contract… If I’m a hacker and I’m able to trigger function a while the previous function was still executing, I might be able to withdraw funds.""  This is similar  to one of the vulnerabilities found in the now-infamous DAO attack of 2016.  ChainSecurity's post explained that prior to Constantinople, storage operations on the network would cost 5,000 gas, exceeding the 2,300 gas usually sent when calling a contract using ""transfer"" or ""send"" functions.  However, if the upgrade was implemented, ""dirty"" storage operations would cost 200 gas. An ""attacker contract can use the 2300 gas stipend to manipulate the vulnerable contract’s variable successfully.""  Constantinople was previously expected to activate last year, but was delayed after issues were found while launching the upgrades on the Ropsten testnet.

42402456,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdJs1c,1547574291,First Grin Block Mined as Mimblewimble Privacy Crypto Goes Live,"Grin, a cryptocurrency that leverages the mimblewimble privacy technology, has just gone live on mainnet.  Named after the tongue-tying curse in the Harry Potter book series, mimblewimble is a protocol that fuses transactions together such that they are indecipherable – even on a public digital ledger.  While it has been in the works since late 2016, Grin saw its first block of transactions (after the network's genesis block) appear Tuesday at 17:38 UTC. A second block was mined less than a minute later, according to one block explorer.  A market for the cryptocurrency is already beginning to form, and though the first block only awards 60 grin, one investor has already bid 0.1 BTC for 1,000 grin (roughly $0.37 per token) on Bisq, a decentralized exchange listing the token. Another bid on Bitmesh values the token much more highly, offering 10 BTC for 1 grin (though the buy order is for 0.001 grin).  What is Grin?  It is the second cryptocurrency leveraging the tech to go live on mainnet, the first being created by an Israel-based startup known as Beam.  As highlighted by Grin developer “Yeastplume” in late October, though the two privacy-focused chains are separate, the projects are by no means in competition, with proponents at Beam even helping to raise funds at one point for Grin development.  Indeed, as stated on the official website, Grin is a fully donations-based initiative that is “launched fairly, free of [initial coin offering], pre-mine or founder’s reward.”  Unlike Beam, Grin has an unfixed monetary policy, meaning it issues tokens once every second.  This is meant to spur confidence in the coin as a currency, Yeastplume told CoinDesk back in December, adding that he didn’t want to “unfairly reward early adopters with an arbitrary deflationary halving schedule.”  And with over 7,000 followers on Grin’s official Twitter account, there is a sizable community supporting and watching the continued development of this privacy coin now that it has officially launched.

42402458,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdJs2b,1547570713,Bitcoin Futures Now Trading At Discount to Exchange Prices,"Signs are emerging that the futures market may not be impressed by bitcoin's recovery from 15-months lows in December – at press time, the cryptocurrency's spot price is higher than the futures price.  As of writing, the global average or spot price calculated by CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) is currently $3,650 – up 16.9 percent from the low of $3,122 reached on December.  Meanwhile, futures contracts are trading below the spot price.  BTC futures        As seen above (CME chart), January futures are reporting a $20 discount (futures price-spot price). Further, contracts expiring in February, March and June are trading at a discount of $30, $40 and $80, respectively.  A futures contract is an agreement between two parties to buy or sell a something at a future specified price and date, allowing for investors to hedge or speculate on the performance of the underlying asset. Hence, BTC futures trading at a discount to spot price (also known as market inversion) is a clear indication that the participants are still bearish.  Put simply, bitcoin’s price in one month, two months and six months from now is expected to be lower than its current price. So, it could be argued that the bear market is alive and kicking.  The outlook would turn bullish if the futures start trading at a premium to spot price. Moreover, that is a classic trait of the bull market.  That said, an unprecedented rise in premium serves as a warning sign of market nearing a long-term top. For instance, BTC futures were carrying a staggering $2,000 premium over spot price in December 2017.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

The firm announced Tuesday that the platform would allow investors to directly trade and invest in financial instruments using the cryptocurrencies bitcoin or ethereum, without first converting to fiat.  The platform will initially host over 150 tokenized securities, tracking the underlying market price of financial instruments such as equity and commodities, it said, while over 10,000 similar offerings could be available in the future.  Currency.com explained that the service lets investors buy a token that would reflect the performance of, say, an Apple share on the Nasdaq stock exchange, at the “same economic costs and benefits of an Apple share.""  “To offer these capabilities, Currency.com leverages the technology of Capital.com, its sister platform regulated by the FCA [U.K. Financial Conduct Authority] and CySEC [Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission], to offer users access to a tokenized version of a contract for exchange of a specific equity, commodity or index,” the firm said.  Currency.com said it's “fully compliant” with “Decree No. 8 On Development of Digital Economy” of the President of the Republic of Belarus, which legalizes blockchain businesses, adding it follows anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) rules, as well as General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR).  The mobile trading apps of the platform, both iOS and Android, are expected to be available as beta versions from February.  This is not the first platform to enable trading of tokenized securities. Earlier this month, Estonia-based crypto startup DX.Exchange launched a trading platform allowing clients to purchase crypto tokens representing shares in different tech firms listed on Nasdaq. DX.Exchange's customers will be able to use select cryptocurrencies, as well as fiat currencies to purchase the tokens.

In a report published Tuesday, the firm said blockchain adoption in the IoT sector grew from 9 percent to 19 percent in 2018, even though the industry is still awaiting regulation around the tech.  Gemalto surveyed 950 tech and business professionals globally for the study, also finding that 23 percent of respondents believe that blockchain tech would be an “ideal” solution to use for securing IoT devices. Further, 91 percent of companies that do not currently use the technology are likely to consider it in the future.  Jason Hart, CTO of data protection at Gemalto, stressed the need for regulatory clarity in a statement, saying:  “Businesses are clearly feeling the pressure of protecting the growing amount of data they collect and store. But while it’s positive they are attempting to address that by investing in more security, such as blockchain, they need direct guidance to ensure they’re not leaving themselves exposed. In order to get this, businesses need to be putting more pressure on the government to act, as it is them that will be hit if they suffer a breach.”  Despite the growth in uptake of blockchain tech, adoption is still in its early stages. As a result, companies are continuing to bank on other methods to protect themselves against hacks, the survey found, with the majority (71 percent) encrypting their data, 66 percent choosing password protection methods, and 38 percent integrating two-factor authentication systems.  However, nearly half of the companies surveyed cannot detect if their IoT devices have suffered a breach, and 95 percent believe that there should be standard security rules and regulations in place.

42402445,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdJqqo,1547550308,This Price Resistance Level May Hold Key to Bitcoin Bull Market,"That bitcoin (BTC) may be closing on a long-term bottom is generally accepted by now.  After all, the leading cryptocurrency by market value has dropped by close to 70 percent over the last 13 months.  The challenge now is to pick up early signs of a long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change, which may be possible with the help of the 10-week simple moving average (SMA).  Acting as resistance, that moving average proved a tough nut to crack in the eight weeks to Nov. 14 – the day BTC reentered the bear market with a big drop below $6,000.  Further, BTC has charted bearish-lower highs above the 10-week SMA in the last 13 months. Hence, acceptance above that hurdle could be considered a sign that the process of bearish-to-bullish trend change has begun.  As of writing, BTC is trading at $3,630 on Bitstamp, representing a 2.5 percent gain on a 24-hour basis. Meanwhile, the 10-week SMA is located at $3,919.  It is worth noting that a full confirmation of a longer-term bullish reversal would be a convincing break above the former support-turned-resistance of the 21-month exponential moving average (EMA), currently at $5,400.  Weekly chart  As seen above, BTC repeatedly failed to cross the 10-week SMA on a weekly closing basis (Sunday's, as per UTC) before falling below $6,000 on Nov. 14.  Prior to that, BTC did cross the 10-week SMA in the last week of both February and April, the third week of July and in the last week of August. These bullish breakouts, however, were short-lived: BTC fell back below the 10-week SMA in the following two weeks, trapping the bulls on the wrong side of the market (marked by arrows).  Put simply, the cryptocurrency has struggled to breach the 10-week SMA throughout the ongoing bear market.  As a result, only a sustained break above the 10-week SMA (at least four weekly candles above the average) would imply bullish reversal.  The outlook remains bearish as long as prices are trading below the downward sloping 10-week SMA of $3,919.  Daily chart  BTC closed back above $3,566 (Dec. 27 low) yesterday, establishing a sideways channel on the daily chart.  With the weekly chart still biased toward the bears, the lower end of the channel, currently at $3,465, could be breached soon. A channel breakdown, if confirmed, would boost the prospects of a drop to the December low of $3,122.  View  A sustained break above the 10-week SMA could be considered an early sign of long-term bullish reversal, although prospects of a near-term move above that average look bleak.  A channel breakdown on the daily chart would bolster the bearish setup and allow a test of demand around the December low of $3,122.

42402444,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdJqrn,1547544663,The 'Thirdening' Approaches: How to Watch Ethereum's Fork as It Happens,"The world’s third largest blockchain by total value, ethereum, is about to upgrade its code.  Named Constantinople, the system-wide upgrade, or hard fork, is set to enact several tech improvements, most designed to increase usability and improve smart contract design, should users of the network decide to upgrade to the new software when it's introduced this week.  Already, excitement is gathering around the upgrade, with developers pointing to one particular update – named EIP 1014 or Skinny CREATE2 – as potentially paving way for new technical innovations.  Still, statistics currently demonstrate that the adoption of Constantinople have been low to date. While developers say the metrics in question are not a fair representation of overall support, it’s worth keeping an eye that this doesn’t interfere with the upgrade. That’s because Constantinople is a kind of upgrade known as a hard fork. In such an upgrade, all nodes within the network, such as miners, exchanges, businesses and users storing full copies of the blockchain, have to update their software.  If the platform’s stakeholders don't update their software, this could lead to the creation of two incompatible blockchains. Cryptocurrencies such as ethereum classic and bitcoin cash were formed out of such an event.  In order for such an outcome to occur, though, and for the split chain to persist, there must be some incentive for users to want to continue to run the older instance. In that regard, Constantinople is an upgrade that has seen widespread community support.  One upgrade in particular – the removal of the difficulty bomb – is largely viewed as necessary for the continued health of the network and the operation of ethereum's blockchain.  Yet while largely non-contentious, Constantinople hasn’t been without its drama. Because it features a tweak to the platform’s economics – reducing the block reward from 3 ETH to 2 ETH per block – in its run-up, developers were forced to navigate the conflicting views of investors and miners, each grappling for a different outcome.  Because of the change, Constantinople has also been nicknamed by some as ""the thirdening,"" a homage to bitcoin's regular ""halving"" events, by which its software programmatically reduces the amount of new supply it introduces at intervals.  As such, it’s worth watching the upgrade as it occurs.  Fork countdown  On ethereum, hard forks are triggered at a particular block number that has been hard-coded into the upgrade software. To participate in the upgrade, miners, exchanges, businesses and users running full nodes must download new software in advance, which will trigger the hard fork when a certain block number is reached.  Constantinople is planned to activate at block number 7,080,000. However, because the time it takes to create blocks tends to fluctuate, establishing when exactly the hard fork is going to hit can be difficult.  Still, there are a number of websites that measure the time it takes to produce blocks and try to estimate when the hard fork will occur.  One such countdown is available on blockchain monitoring and analytics firm, Amber Data. According to the website, Constantinople is due to activate on Thursday at around 4:00 UTC.  Another fork countdown website is data resource CoinGecko, that shows similar estimates to Amber Data – predicting the fork to activate at around 3:30 UTC Thursday.  A countdown timer by release manager for the Parity Ethereum client, Afri Schoedon, states Constantinople is due to activate on Thursday at around 3:09 UTC.  Schoedon’s countdown has the broader function of tracking the growth of the ethereum blockchain. While there’s subtle differences between each prediction, according to him, this is due to how websites approach the calculation and is likely to reconcile as the block number approaches.  “Mine uses a fixed-time average, so it will be more and more accurate the closer we get to the fork,” Schoedon said.  Fork monitor  Deployed by developers to track the progress and health of the upgrade, one of the most useful tools for tracking Constantinople progress is the fork monitor. This tool allows developers to monitor the hard fork in real time, providing a visual graph of the blockchain data as it accumulates.  Using this tool, developers can witness the network diverge into Byzantium (the current software paradigm) and Constantinople blockchains, and can ensure that no further blocks are being produced on the old chain.  The monitor also tracks the difficulty and hashrate of both chains, which should differ substantially once the block number has been reached. If any non-orthodox network activity occurs at the fork time, this will show up on the monitor as well.  That said, it’s worth noting that small diverges in ethereum’s blockchain are normal. Tiny forks frequently occur – and are quickly abandoned – due to ethereum’s use of what is called an “uncle,” that allows the platform to have faster block times by abandoning the occasional block.  When it comes to the fork activation point, the difference between a split and an uncled block will be obvious, as it should be a clear, permanent divergence between the two blockchains.  Still, the monitor only tracks ethereum’s two most popular software clients, Geth and Parity, that together account for roughly 70 percent of the overall network and may not be 100 percent accurate.  Mining hashrate  Critical to this particular upgrade is the mining hashrate, and the ways in which it might differ once the hard fork has occurred. A metric which reveals how many miners are participating on the blockchain, this is a good way to demonstrate the upgrade’s overall support.  Additionally, miners are a key party responsible for orchestrating a chain split, because they are the party that ensures whether a transaction will confirm by sorting those transactions into blocks.  As such, it’s worth keeping an eye on whether hashrate continues, and for how long, on the Byzantium blockchain.  Hash rate on both sides of the upgrade is visible on the ethereum developer’s fork monitor tool. Additionally, metrics website Etherscan shows a graph of the network’s hash rate over time.  Still, the current ethereum software contains what is known as a difficulty bomb, an algorithm that increases the mining difficulty overtime, eventually to the point that mining Byzantium is impossible.  While the difficulty bomb has been delayed on the Constantinople software, it’s presence on Byzantium means that even in the case of a split, it is unlikely to persist beyond a couple of months, unless Byzantium is still seeing active development.  Nodes  While not responsible for confirming transactions, another critical party within the ethereum ecosystem is nodes, that run ethereum software and store full copies of the blockchain.  Full nodes are typically run by developers, businesses, mining pools and users that use full nodes to benefit from increased privacy and security. Users running full nodes can also witness the blockchain fork in real time from their own computer.  Currently, a tracking website called Ethernodeshttps://ethernodes.org/network/1/forkwatch/overview shows low statistics for the adoption of the Constantinople upgrade. According to the monitor, the total number of Constantinople compatible full nodes on Geth and Parity is a mere 15.5 percent.  Yet while this is a surprisingly low number, Peter Pratscher, CEO of top ethereum mining pool Ethermine, and owner of the Ethernodes website, said that the number was inaccurate, and that adoption is actually closer to a majority.  “The adoption you see on [Ethernodes] is not fully accurate as the explorer calculates this statistic taking into account lots of obsolete [and] old Geth/ Parity nodes,” he said in an email.  Speaking on Twitter, Parity’s Schoedon echoed this, stating that Ethernode’s scraping software includes many nodes that are no longer operative, and ignores nodes that do not correspond to its network queries.  (According to Schoedon, this includes misrepresenting the amount of nodes on ethereum – said to be around 30,000 – to a mere 10,000.)  Ethernode’s is in the process of updating their software, with a new scraping technique that is currently in the process of taking samples of the network and creating a partial representation. A preview of the new scraping tool is available here.  According to this tool, the total number of upgraded nodes is currently 44 percent. While this is still low, according to Schoedon it isn’t cause for concern.  “An upgrade rate of 44 [percent] is (probably) fine as long as we communicate the importance of the upgrade to the key stakeholders of the ethereum ecosystem,” Schoedon tweeted.  Live stream  Perhaps the most engaging way to watch the activation of Constantinople is with live commentary from the developers who wrote the code.  Mimicking the style of ethereum's core developers biweekly meeting, developers are gathering together to watch the code switch in real time.  ""It is basically a live stream of core developers and potentially some community members joining a Zoom call. It is both a celebration of Constantinople happening and a call to monitor the transition,"" Hudson Jameson, developer relations for the Ethereum Foundation, said.  Accessible by the public on YouTube, the meeting is due kick off shortly before the upgrade happens.  You can listen in to the livestream here.  Price  Finally, another metric to monitor surrounding the upgrade is the price of ether, which may fluctuate in the run up to and following the upgrade.  To keep an eye on this, the CoinDesk Price Index will monitor any shifts in real time.

42402442,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdJqoq,1547528772,All Crypto Is Created Equal? That's What Regulators Seem to See,"Mason Borda is an entrepreneur who has spent his career building secure infrastructure to enable the compliant transfer of digital assets. He is the CEO and co-founder of TokenSoft Inc, which offers a suite of products focused on institutional grade compliance for companies to issue and manage digital assets and digital securities.  The following is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk’s 2018 Year in Review.  As we enter 2019, it’s clear that blockchain technology is predicted to disrupt a range of industries, and that the future of blockchains may reside with tokens. In fact, in the second half of 2018, security tokens became one of the most written about areas within the growing digital asset industry.  Publications have started to call 2019 the year of the security token.  But what does that mean? Are all tokens created equal? The reality is that the term “security token” is an overly broad designation which lumps digital assets and digital securities into a single bucket. Furthermore, it’s possible for a digital asset to convert to a digital security, and vice-versa, based on the facts and circumstances of the token.  In our view, the two types aren’t that different in terms of how regulators view them today. Let’s take a closer look.  Digital Assets  A digital asset is a standard blockchain token or coin that enables access to products or services, with the value of the digital asset derived from usage of the ecosystem of which it is a part. These tokens are often referred to as utility tokens, as they are designed for a specific use case within a blockchain ecosystem.  These tokens do not represent historical equity interests in or debt obligations of an organization entity, and they are not backed by a traditional underlying asset. Of course, securities regulators usually regard digital asset tokens as securities because they often involve purchasers investing money to acquire the token expecting to make profits from the efforts of others who use the purchasers’ funds to develop the network.  However, securities regulators might entertain arguments that, at some point in time, such digital asset tokens are no longer securities. Said SEC Director of Corporate Finance William Hinman:  ""And so, when I look at Bitcoin today, I do not see a central third party whose efforts are a key determining factor in the enterprise. The network on which bitcoin functions is operational and appears to have been decentralized for some time, perhaps from inception. Applying the disclosure regime of the federal securities laws to the offer and resale of Bitcoin would seem to add little value. And putting aside the fundraising that accompanied the creation of Ether, based on my understanding of the present state of Ether, the Ethereum network and its decentralized structure, current offers and sales of Ether are not securities transactions. And, as with Bitcoin, applying the disclosure regime of the federal securities laws to current transactions in Ether would seem to add little value. Over time, there may be other sufficiently decentralized networks and systems where regulating the tokens or coins that function on them as securities may not be required. And of course there will continue to be systems that rely on central actors whose efforts are a key to the success of the enterprise. In those cases, application of the securities laws protects the investors who purchase the tokens or coins.""  While digital assets don’t represent a share in a company, they may grow in price and provide profits to their owners. Therein lies the gray area whereby the SEC has stated that it’s likely that most tokens are in fact securities and should adhere to applicable regulations.  Digital Securities  A digital security, often referred to as a tokenized security, is essentially a traditional security that has been launched as a blockchain token. It could represent a share in a corporation, a portion of a note or other debt security, or a fractionalized interest in an underlying asset or bundle of assets (such as real estate, artwork or ETFs). But these digital tokens are plainly intended to be securities and are subject to traditional securities laws.  In the United States, offers and sales of securities must be registered with the SEC or qualify for an exemption, such as Reg D (for private placement offerings generally to accredited investors) and Reg A (sometimes called “mini-IPOs” due to the SEC review process for these offerings), among others.  Similar laws apply in most major commercial jurisdictions around the globe.  There are important benefits afforded by blockchain technology, such as near instantaneous trading and settlement, 24/7 access and liquidity, automated controls for transfer and trade restrictions programmed into the token, direct issuance to a larger investor pool, and more. But accessing these benefits should be done carefully and with the advice of experienced legal and other professionals.  Today, we see issuers of digital assets considering retroactively taking steps to meet security regulations in the U.S. and other jurisdictions. In essence, this means digital assets will become digital securities. And we’re back to the idea that while all tokens are not created equal, they may need to follow the same regulatory frameworks.

Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, Elaine Sun Ye Lin, former head of compliance for the Chinese branch of State Street, joined the Singapore-based exchange as a compliance director last month. According to Huobi spokesperson Jiayi Li, Sun will direct Huobi's compliance efforts globally.  As regulators in different countries are paying ever-closer attention at crypto, Huobi hopes to benefit from Sun's expertise in working with government bodies around the world, the company said.  “We are happy to welcome Elaine into the Huobi family. Her expertise in compliance and in traditional financial markets will definitely be an asset to the company as we look to ensure our compliance and work with regulatory bodies,” Fu Liting, HR director of Huobi Group, said through a spokesperson.  Sun worked at State Street for more than six years and earlier worked at a Singapore-based OCBC bank in the Shanghai City office, according to her LinkedIn profile.  Attracting talent  Neil Dundon, director of CryptoRecruit, the specialized headhunter firm that recruited Sun for Huobi, told CoinDesk the flow of IT and finance professionals into the crypto space has become a robust trend.  ""CryptoRecruit has noticed a huge increase in the number of people from traditional banks who are extremely receptive when we approach them for potential job opportunities in crypto,"" he said. ""Developers have been moving over from tech firms since last year but to see bankers making the move is reassuring as to where the future of this industry is headed.""  Indeed, a number of former Wall Street veterans and alumni of major traditional finance companies recently joined blockchain- and crypto-related startups.  Last year, Coinbase on-boarded a bunch of former Wall Street execs, like Brian Brooks from Fannie Mae, Chris Dodds from Charles Schwab, Oputa Ezediaro from JPMorgan, Eric Scro from the New York Stock Exchange and Christine Sandler from Barclays. This month, a former vice chairman of NASDAQ Europe, Hans-Ole Jocumsen, joined the Swiss-based non-profit Concordium Foundation, which is building an AML/KYC-compliant blockchain.
