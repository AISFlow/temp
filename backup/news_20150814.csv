42398579,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbcH3u,1439574210,FinCEN Rules Commodity-Backed Token Services are Money Transmitters,"The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has issued a new ruling applicable to US businesses seeking to tokenize commodities for blockchain-based trading.  Despite being a response to a specific inquiry by an unnamed company, the letter could be read as broadly applicable to startups seeking to both custody physical assets and issue a digital asset for use in trading. Under such business models, FinCEN suggests startups would need to be licensed in all 50 states.  The letter describes the company behind the submission as one that provides an ""Internet-based brokerage service"" that connects buyers and sellers of precious metals; buys and sells precious metals on its own account; holds precious metals for clients and issues ""digital proof of custody"" in the form of a token on the bitcoin blockchain.  In this specific instance, FinCEN argues the company in question does not fall under an electronic currency or commodities trading exemption as it allows ""unrestricted transfer of value from a customer's commodity position to the position of another customer or a third-party"".  The ruling reads:  ""FinCEN finds that, as the company is going beyond the activities of a broker or dealer in commodities and is acting as a convertible virtual currency administrator (with the freely transferable digital certificates being the commodity-backed virtual currency), the company falls under the definition of money transmitter.""  The statement is the latest from FinCEN to clarify which types of US bitcoin services it considers money transmitters following similar declarations for bitcoin processors, escrow services and miners, among other groups.  Exceptions  Notably, FinCEN did offer guidance as to how such business models could be crafted should the company in question want to avoid the requirements associated with being categorized as a money transmitter in the US.  In particular, FinCEN referenced a 2011 decision in which it carved out an exemption to entities that only provide ""the delivery, communication, or network data access services used by a money transmitter to supply money transmission services"".  The letter reads:  ""To the extent the only type of brokerage services offered by the company are those in which the buyer makes payment directly to the seller, the company would meet this exemption and FinCEN would not deem the company a money transmitter.""  FinCEN further called back to 2008 guidance in which it stated that broker-dealers in commodities or currencies are money transmitters if they transfer funds between a customer and a third party that is not part of the transactions.  ""Such transmission of funds is no longer a fundamental element of the actual transaction necessary to execute the contract for the purchase or sale of the currency or the other commodity,"" it said.  The agency also nodded to its past rulings on virtual currencies to suggest such a definition could be used to capture tokens meant to represent items with a real-world value.  ""This type of virtual currency either has an equivalent value in real currency, or acts as a substitute for real currency,"" it said.  Interpretations  Risk and compliance specialist Juan Llanos, who has formerly worked with such firms as Bitcoin Foundation and Bitreserve, suggested the ruling should be read as broadly applicable to businesses seeking to issue blockchain-based assets.  Llanos told CoinDesk:  ""The broader statement is that issuing a certificate of ownership (whether paper, digital or even a statement) and allowing the unrestricted transfer of value is what makes a broker or dealer (or any other company, for that matter) a money transmitter.""  Llanos suggested the interpretation could extend to many parts of the bitcoin ecosystem, even services like bitcoin wallet provider Blockchain, which has argued that it provides only the software necessary for users to hold bitcoin.  ""The government could argue that a wallet service, by providing an 'account' or a representation of value via the software, is in fact 'issuing' a certificate of ownership or representing the ownership of value electronically,"" he suggested.  Ultimately, Llanos inferred that the ruling would increase the number of companies in the space that fall under the definition of money transmission and would thus be governed by Bank Secrecy Act regulations.

42398595,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbcHGh,1439564496,What Tokyo's Mt Gox Ruling Means for Bitcoin in Japan,"Akihiro Shiba is an attorney-at-law qualified in Japan, working at Nishimura & Asahi's Tokyo office, with expertise in financial regulations and transactions and provides advice on virtual currencies. In this article, he examines what the recent Tokyo District Court ruling means for the status of bitcoin in Japan.  In a lawsuit filed by an individual against the bankruptcy trustee for Mt Gox, formerly the most widely used bitcoin exchange in the world, the Tokyo District Court handed down a judgment on 5th August, 2015, holding that bitcoins are not subject to ownership.  This is probably the first judicial decision in Japan that provides an analysis of the legal nature of bitcoins and the status of a bitcoin depositor in insolvency proceedings.  Six things you should know about the judgment  It is a district court judgment, without binding effect on anyone other than the parties involved, and can still be appealed. We cannot conclude at this stage that this judgment represents the established view under Japanese law.    It is an analysis under Japanese law and is basically not applicable in any other country.      This judgment was in favor of Mt Gox’s bankruptcy trustee, so the plaintiff’s claim for preferential recovery was denied. The judgment will not cause any change in the treatment of Mt Gox creditors.      There should be further consideration of how to fully protect customers’ bitcoins from an exchange’s insolvency.      Under Japanese law, the lack of “ownability” of bitcoins does not necessarily mean they are not afforded legal protection.      Under Japanese law, the lack of “ownability” might be a positive feature of bitcoins as a medium of exchange.    The arguments made in the case  In this lawsuit, the plaintiff claimed delivery of approximately 459 bitcoins against Mt Gox, arguing that:  Bitcoins can be subject to ownership under the Civil Code of Japan.    The bitcoins stored in the bitcoin addresses for which Mt Gox held or managed the private key should be regarded as being occupied by Mt Gox but co-owned by all the users, including the plaintiff.      Therefore, the plaintiff could demand the return of the bitcoins corresponding to its co-ownership interest outside of the bankruptcy proceedings.    The bankruptcy trustee for Mt Gox disputed the claim, refuting the plaintiff’s arguments, including (1) above.  The court ruled in favor of the trustee, arguing that bitcoins cannot be subject to ownership for the following reasons:  a) According to Article 85 of the Civil Code of Japan (which states, “In this Act, ‘thing’ means a corporeal thing.”), an object of ownership must occupy a portion of space such as a liquid, gas, or solid, in contrast with rights (including claims and copyrights) and natural forces (like electricity, heat, and light). In this regard, it is clear that bitcoins do not occupy a portion of space.  b) Furthermore, an object of ownership must be subject to exclusive controllability. In this regard, those who manage a bitcoin address cannot be regarded as controlling the balance of bitcoins in the address exclusively.  The court’s view on what can be subject to ownership is substantially identical to the prevailing view of Japanese civil law scholars. Therefore, I believe that most Japanese lawyers would likely support the conclusion and reasoning in (a) above. (On the other hand, since bitcoins were held not to satisfy requirement (a), I believe that there was no need to make the debatable argument in (b) above.)  Although I agree with the above, it cannot be concluded at this stage that this judgment represents the established view on the legal status of bitcoins in Japan as it is only a district court judgment, without binding effect on anyone other than the parties involved, and can still be appealed.  Furthermore, this judgment only provides an analysis under Japanese law, and there are a variety of rules from country to country regarding what can be subject to ownership or title. Therefore, the court’s view is basically not applicable in any other country.  Impact on Mt Gox creditors  The position of Mt Gox’s bankruptcy trustee on the status of the bitcoin depositors seems to have been as follows:  They have a contractual right to demand the return of deposited bitcoins, rather than ownership of them.    Thus, they would be treated as bankruptcy creditors to whom the assets of Mt Gox will be distributed, as with cash depositors or any other creditors, if they filed their claims before the deadline of noon of July 29, 2015 (JST).    Although this position was challenged by the plaintiff, claiming ownership rather than a contractual right, the trustee’s position in (1) above was upheld by the court; accordingly, the plaintiff’s claim for preferential recovery was denied. Therefore, the judgment will not cause any change in the treatment of Mt Gox creditors.  No protection of customers’ bitcoins from insolvency?  Some people may think that, based on the court’s view, bitcoins held in a customer’s account with an exchange will not be fully protected if the exchange becomes insolvent. This is not accurate.  The court’s view on the treatment of bitcoin depositors in Mt Gox’s bankruptcy proceedings would not apply to other cases if the facts in those cases differ from those established in the Mt Gox judgement.  For example, the treatment of such bitcoins may have been different if the private key for the bitcoin address was stored on the exchange’s server but was still controlled and managed by the customer. In any case, there should be further consideration of how to fully protect customers’ bitcoins from an exchange’s insolvency.  No legal protection from offences?  Some people may assume that if bitcoins cannot be owned, bitcoins cannot be legally protected from offenses at all. This is simply not true, however, at least under Japanese law.  For example, Article 709 of the Civil Code of Japan imposes tort liability for damages on a person who has intentionally or negligently infringed “any right or legally protected interest” of another person. I believe that this provision would apply if someone stole your bitcoins.  Similarly, some criminal law provisions prohibit individuals from obtaining, or causing another person to obtain, “an unlawful economic gain” through the methods specified by those provisions.  Tradable without ownership?  Some people may also think that if bitcoins cannot be owned, they cannot be bought or sold validly, nor can they be effectively used as a payment method. This is also incorrect, at least under Japanese law.  If you enter into an agreement by which one party agrees to send a certain amount of bitcoins from his/her bitcoin address to another specific address, it can be a valid and enforceable contract under the principle of freedom of contract, at least under Japanese law.  This is somewhat similar to an electricity supply agreement where the supplier agrees to supply (or sell) electricity to the other party, even though electricity cannot be subject to ownership according to the prevailing theory.  Actually, under Japanese law, the lack of “ownability” might be a positive feature of bitcoins as a medium of exchange.  If there were ownership in bitcoins, when you received bitcoins from another person, you would be exposed to the risk of someone demanding that you return the bitcoins to them, arguing that they are the owner instead of you – possible reasons for this could be, for example, if the bitcoins were stolen from them or if the agreement under which they sold the bitcoins was nullified.  The lack of “ownability” frees bitcoins from those risks.

42398587,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbcHAn,1439549344,California Assemblyman Defends Bitcoin Bill,"Assemblyman Matt Dababneh, who penned California's AB-1326 bill seeking to regulate virtual currency businesses, has defended his proposal against critics.  Last week  , the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) said the bill, which would prohibit virtual currency businesses from operating unless licensed to do so by the Department of Business Oversight (DBO), threatened the future of digital currency experimentation and innovation in the state of California.  Dababneh said in a statement:  ""First, EFF has little expertise in the area of financial regulation and is generally beyond its depths on the appropriate levels of safety and soundness regulation required of financial service providers.""  He continued: ""EFF argues that the language in AB-1326 is vague, making it unclear who should be licensed and that it contains requirements that it will stifle innovation. The language in the bill is very clear and has been negotiated with the companies that actually develop platforms in the virtual currency ecosystem.""  The very entities that will be licensed, Dababneh added, have been comfortable with the clarity contained in the legislation, which he claims, includes innovation-friendly provisions.  EFF had previously stated it had philosophical issues with the bill, saying the regulation was premature and that having different state regulations would prove confusing for consumers.  The Assemblyman refuted EFF's claims, noting regulation was necessary as consumers had lost over half a billion dollars due to scams and hackings in the bitcoin space to date. ""AB-1326 treats virtual currency companies just like any other financial service. If you hold value for a consumer, then the consumer must have protection and potential redress if something goes wrong.""  Distance from the BitLicense  Dababneh distanced his bill from New York's BitLicense, commenting that AB-1326 was ""far friendlier to innovators and the long-term future of virtual currency"".  As he continued to defend his bill against further criticism by the EFF, Dababneh concluded by saying:  ""Not only has EFF never been engaged with my office, but their tactics have not altered one word of the bill language. Rather, I have worked with groups that are interested in making progress rather than those that have no positive input to offer and only make specious arguments.""  The Copia Institute is also opposing the bill.

42398593,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbcHEj,1439542803,How Does US Law Apply to Foreign Cryptocurrency Companies?,"Jared Marx is an attorney at Washington, DC law firm Harris, Wiltshire & Grannis. He advises companies about bitcoin-related regulatory law and represents companies and individuals in civil and criminal proceedings. Here, he discusses how US law applies to non-US cryptocurrency companies.  The blockchain is borderless, but nations are not. Because of this, one of the well-known challenges of running a successful cryptocurrency business is navigating divergent legal systems.  For non-US companies, however, this is complicated even further by the fact that the United States often enforces its laws beyond its own borders. That’s because US enforcement authorities take an expansive view of their jurisdiction, sometimes prosecuting those with only very tangential links to the US.  Applying US law  So exactly how does US law apply outside of its physical borders?  The first and most important thing to know is that, as a general matter, any company that does business in the United States is likely to be subject to US law, even if the company isn’t located here. So incorporating in Finland and locating servers and employees in Helsinki won’t eliminate the effect of US law for a company that mostly serves US customers.  That means that non-US bitcoin exchanges that allow US-based persons to trade on their platforms generally need to be licensed money transmitters under US law, just as do cloud-based wallet systems that allow transactions on US soil. Similarly, foreign entities that make crowdsales to US-based persons are likely subject to US securities laws (to the extent that anyone can tell whether those laws apply).  Of course, companies whose employees, bank accounts, and servers are all located outside the United States have less at stake if the United States attempts to apply its law to them, for the simple reason that it’s more difficult for US enforcement agencies to seize funds or computers overseas. But those companies are not immune, as police agencies around the globe regularly work together, and often cooperate to arrest and extradite individuals who have been charged with offenses in other countries.  Contact  How much contact with the United States does a company need for US laws to apply to it? That can be a fact-intensive question, but a good shorthand is that if a web-based company has any users who are located in the US, there’s a good chance that a judge would agree that they’re subject to US law, at least with respect to the company’s interactions with those US-based persons.  [post-quote]  What, then, if a company avoids US customers altogether? This is a surer route to avoiding US law, but still not bulletproof. Federal prosecutors sometimes assert jurisdiction based on hooks like the use of a US bank, or an allegation that a company conspired with a US person.  For example, the US terrorist financing statute makes it a crime to participate in terrorist financing anywhere in the world, as long as the financing is “directed toward” an attack against the United States.  For US citizens working abroad, there are also additional concerns. Statutes proscribing money laundering, terrorist financing, and foreign corruption all expressly apply to Americans overseas, even when no other connection to the United States exists.  For non-US companies that are concerned that US law might apply to them, the primary issue is usually whether the company has either avoided or met the requirements of US money transmitter laws. But a good compliance plan will also account for a number of other areas of law, including money laundering, consumer protection, privacy, and commodities laws.  For many small companies affected by these issues, these are largely theoretical concerns. Enforcement—both civil and criminal—is always least likely against small enterprises. But the inverse is also true: the more successful the business, the more attention it will get from enforcement agencies.  So for non-US companies who want or expect to be successful, some early strategic thinking with a competent lawyer can avoid great expense and potential criminal exposure later on.
