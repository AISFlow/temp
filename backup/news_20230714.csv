The court session marks the latest twist in a long and complex narrative that has unfolded within the crypto lending industry. An Array of Charges On the day of his arraignment, Mashinsky, 57, turned up to the Manhattan federal court in an understated gray polo shirt and jeans, and without handcuffs. He was arrested following a slew of lawsuits initiated by several federal regulatory agencies, including the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As reported by Reuters, the charges against Mashinsky and Celsius revolve around allegations that they ""misled customers and artificially inflated the value of [Celsius's] propriety crypto token."" In total, Mashinsky was charged with seven criminal counts, an indictment that was unsealed on the same day of his court appearance. A High-Profile Case This case isn't the first legal challenge Celsius and Mashinsky have faced. Earlier this year, New York state's attorney general also accused Mashinsky of fraud. Notably, Mashinsky's arrest comes at a time of increased scrutiny for the crypto industry, with numerous other platforms facing similar allegations. As Reuters puts it, the industry is undergoing ""a reckoning after a slump in crypto prices led to the collapse of several companies."" In a public statement, U.S. Attorney Damian Williams made his stance clear: ""Whether it's old-school fraud or some new-school crypto scheme, it doesn't matter one bit. It's all fraud to us."" Accusations and Counterarguments Celsius Network, founded by Mashinsky in 2017, promised easy loan access and high interest rates to depositors, with the company lending out tokens to institutional investors with the intention of profiting from the difference. But the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in July 2022 after a wave of customer withdrawal requests during a downturn in crypto prices. The SEC's lawsuit against Mashinsky and Celsius alleges that the firm misled investors about the company's financial health, even as it pursued increasingly risky strategies to deliver high promised returns. Despite the significant loss of funds as customers rushed to withdraw, Mashinsky and Celsius continued to assert that the company was financially stable and had sufficient funds to meet withdrawals, the SEC claimed. Awaiting What's Next Despite the mounting allegations and legal challenges, Mashinsky and his legal team remain defiant. His attorneys, Benjamin Alee and Jonathan Ohring, have signaled their intent to challenge the charges, stating that Mashinsky ""looks forward to vigorously defending himself in court against these baseless charges."" As the case proceeds, the world will watch closely, considering the potential implications not just for Mashinsky and Celsius, but also for the broader crypto industry.

The company expects to benefit from the growing international crypto market, new clients from various sectors, and agreements with large clients. Despite potential risks from failed restructuring efforts or regulatory changes, Bakkt is considered undervalued, with a beneficial outlook for 2023. Bakkt Holdings, Inc. ( BKKT ) recently announced that the acquisition of Apex and new inorganic opportunities may enhance revenue growth in 2023 and the coming years. I also think that internationalization efforts, clients coming from new sectors, and agreements with new large clients could bring substantial net sales growth. Yes, I see risks from the potential failed restructuring efforts executed in the last quarter or regulatory changes, however, BKKT does appear undervalued. Software Platform For Crypto And Beneficial Outlook For 2023 Bakkt connects the digital economy by offering a software platform for crypto and redeeming loyalty and reward points that are issued by clients to their customers. The company helps clients deliver new opportunities to their customers thanks to interactive web experiences or APIs. Source: Company's Website Bakkt believes that the company will most likely enjoy significant momentum growth thanks to the growth of the international crypto market. I believe that this is one of the reasons to have a look at the company's business model even if the company does not deliver a significant FCF margin right now. We are talking about a market that may be growing at close to 27.8% from 2022 to 2030. The global cryptocurrency exchange platform market size was valued at USD 30.18 billion in 2021 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 27.8% from 2022 to 2030. The growing popularity of digital assets, such as cryptocurrencies and Non-Fungible Tokens, is anticipated to increase the demand for cryptocurrency exchange platforms. Source: Cryptocurrency Exchange Platform Market Size Report, 2030 With that about the growing market, I believe that the outlook appears beneficial. The company expects to report gross revenue close to $1.874-2.384 billion, and Apex Crypto sales would recover throughout 2023. Source: Quarterly Presentation Clean Balance Sheet As of March 31, 2023, the company reported cash and cash equivalents worth $50 million, with restricted cash of $19 million, cash held in escrow of $67 million, and accounts receivable of about $25 million. Also, with prepaid insurance of close to $18 million, safeguarding assets for crypto worth $26 million, property, equipment, and software worth $20 million, and goodwill of $15 million, total assets stand at close to $413 million. The asset/liability ratio stands at close to 4x, and the ratio of current assets/current liabilities is larger than 1x. In sum, I believe that the balance sheet appears very solid. Source: 10-Q With regards to the total amount of liabilities, Bakkt reported accounts payable and accrued liabilities worth $49 million, safeguarding obligation for crypto close to $26 million, and total liabilities of $115 million. Source: 10-Q DCF Model: M&A Integration, International Revenue, And New Clients From New Sectors Would Imply Significant Upside In The Stock Price Under my financial model, I assumed that Bakkt would successfully expand its crypto platform, and successfully invest in further trading capabilities. I also believe that the company could broaden its network with new clients, which would most likely serve as a revenue catalyst for the coming years. I think that the combination of the assets of Apex would be beneficial for Bakkt. In this regard, it is worth mentioning that Bakkt is adding close to 5.8 million accounts, and will most likely enhance the FCF margin of the company. Management provided a significant number of details about the integration with Apex in a recent presentation. I can feel the optimism from their recent slides. Source: Quarterly Presentation I believe that the most interesting thing about the acquisition is that Bakkt obtains access to a significant number of sectors. Many new players will most likely be able to try the platform offered by Bakkt, which would most likely multiply the opportunities for revenue generation. Source: Quarterly Presentation Further acquisitions are quite likely mainly because the balance sheet does not show a lot of debt, and management proved that it was ready to work inorganically. In addition, Bakkt noted that it is constantly looking for new acquisitions to make revenue growth more dynamic. I think that expectations of more inorganic growth may accelerate the expectations about future FCF growth and net sales growth. We will continue to be opportunistic and evaluate strategic acquisitions that have compelling benefits for our business. Source: 10-K . Under my DCF model, I would expect an increase in international revenue mainly coming from Asia, Western Europe, and the UK. In this regard, management noted that there is strong demand from clients all over the world thanks to new regulatory clarity in many countries. Source: Quarterly Presentation Additionally, I would be expecting further connections with new large clients. In this regard, it is worth noting that the company already works with massive corporations like MasterCard (MA), Visa (V), Global Payments (GPN), Fiserv (FI), and Caesar's (CZR). In my opinion, potential large clients will most likely be interested in Bakkt once they see that management already works with large and established partners. We partner with leading brands and expect to grow customers on our platform through those relationships. We have already built an extensive network of clients across numerous industries including financial institutions, merchants, and travel and entertainment. These clients include MasterCard, Visa, Global Payments, Fiserv, and Caesar's. We believe that this strategy will enable us to add transacting accounts and volume more quickly and more efficiently than a direct-to-consumer model, especially as a relatively young company operating in a space like crypto that may be novel to some users. Source: 10-k My financial model includes 2033 net income worth $36 million, 2033 depreciation and amortization of -$100 million, share-based compensation expense of close to $5 million, unit-based compensation expenses of $23 million, and deferred income taxes close to $125 million. Also, with 2033 changes in accounts receivable of about $8 million, 2033 prepaid insurance of close to $16 million, changes in accounts payable and accrued liabilities worth $43 million, and changes in debt due to related parties of -$19 million, 2033 net cash used in operating activities would be about $136 million. Finally, if we assume 2033 capitalized internal-use other capex of about -$39 million, 2033 FCF would be about $98 million. Source: My Financial Model If we assume a terminal EV/FCF of 25x and a discount close to 10%, the implied enterprise value would be close to $1.209 billion. Also, adding cash and cash equivalents close to $50 million, restricted cash of $19 million, and cash held in escrow worth $67 million, and subtracting safeguarding obligation for crypto worth $26 million and warrant liability of $1 million, the implied equity valuation would be $1.318 billion, and the fair price would be $4.95 per share. Source: My Financial Model Risks From Lack Of Customer Growth, And Lower Transacting In Crypto And Loyalty Points Taking into account the current state of Bakkt, I believe that the most worrying risk would come from a lack of new clients. Besides, if the number of transacting in crypto and loyalty points executed by each existing customer lowers for whatever reason, net sales expectations would also decline substantially. As a result, I think that we could expect lower FCF expectations and lower implied fair valuation. Management provided a full explanation of these risks in the last annual report. If we are not able to bring new clients onto the platform, many of whom will pay us subscription fees for our platform services, our revenue and business concern could be negatively impacted. Additionally, much of our future revenue depends on transaction fees earned from customers transacting in crypto and loyalty points and the margin we charge in connection with those transactions. If we are not able to continue to grow our base of clients, we will not be able to continue to grow our customer base, our revenues, or our business, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations and may cause us to be unable to continue as a going concern. Source: 10-k Bakkt will most likely offer new features and new additional applications in the platform. New features may not be appreciated by clients, or regulators may block some of the new functionalities that the company may want to offer. Lack of new innovations or failed new features would most likely lead to lower FCF growth and a lower implied price. We are working to expand our service offerings, including, for example offering crypto rewards. Our platform will require additional development in order to add all of the additional functionalities and features planned by our management and activate our service offerings. There can be no assurance that the additional functionalities and features currently planned for our platform will be successfully developed in a timely fashion or at all. The addition of functionalities to our platform may require regulatory approvals, may increase our regulatory obligations and the degree of regulatory scrutiny we face, and may make regulatory compliance more complex and burdensome. Source: 10-k In the last quarterly report, Bakkt included restructuring expenses that I did not see in the quarter ended March 31, 2022. Quarterly restructuring stood at $4.2 million. I would be worried about failed restructuring efforts. If talented personnel leave the company, Bakkt may suffer lower revenue growth in the coming future and even loss of know-how. The most worrying is that investors out there would most likely not know whether these initiatives will be successful. Source: 10-Q The company noted that restructuring expenses intend to simplify operations, and will focus on scalability and product development. In my view, investors will do good by looking carefully at the following lines. Restructuring expenses of $4.3 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023, consists of severance costs and accelerated vesting of non-cash compensation as part of our business simplification initiatives to focus on capabilities with strong product market fit and scalability. Source: 10-Q With regards to the equity structure, I do not like that the company came with different share classes, which most investors out there may not appreciate. In my view, it creates a lot of issues for professionals making calculations about the fair price. Many investors may not be interested in Bakkt because of its equity structure, which may lower the demand for the stock, and affect the cost of equity. Source: Quarterly Presentation Conclusion Bakkt may benefit from the growing cryptocurrency market, and with the acquisition of Apex, management expects revenue growth to increase in 2023. Additionally, management appears to be looking at new acquisitions, which may enhance future inorganic growth. I also think that further internationalization, new clients from new sectors, and additional features in the platform could accelerate organic growth from 2023. I do see risks from failed restructuring efforts, new regulatory changes, and failed M&A efforts, however, I believe that Bakkt appears a bit undervalued.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | ICO | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4617209-bakkt-inorganic-growth-efforts-crypto-growth-and-undervalued?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/14895747.jpeg

14894483,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=542775,1689368453,"XRP Explodes With 1,300% Surge In Trading Volume As crypto Exchanges Jump On Board","In a long-awaited decision, Judge Torres ruled in favor of XRP in their case against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) yesterday. The verdict is a positive development for the cryptocurrency industry, particularly with a focus on whether digital assets should be deemed securities in the US. The ruling is expected to set a precedent for the industry moving forward. It is positive for both altcoins and the wider industry, as the default expectation is that these assets are not deemed securities so long as they are made available to the public. This event will likely have wider implications for ongoing legal cases and may help rebuild confidence in the industry for developers and attract more liquidity to the ecosystem. XRP Defies Expectations With Massive Price Surge And Trading Volume Spike Following the news, XRP saw a surge in price, reaching as high as $0.93, the highest price since May 2021, and closing at $0.82. According to data compiled by the research company CCData, the news led to an influx of trading activity, with XRP trading pairs on centralized exchanges (CEX) recording a total volume of $6.05 billion on the day, an increase of 1351% from the previous day. Related Reading: Crypto Liquidations Cross $300 Million Amid Massive Market Recovery The relisting of the asset on other centralized exchanges, including Coinbase, Kraken, and Gemini has also contributed to the spike in volumes. The news surrounding the ruling also led to almost 100% daily gains for XRP, with other tokens such as Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA), recently deemed securities, seeing significant gains of 35% and 28%, respectively. Despite the negative backdrop that XRP has faced due to the lawsuit, its market depth liquidity at the 1% level has remained resilient year-to-date (YTD). XRP’s 1% bid/ask side depth at Yearly Open was 26.5 million XRP, which saw a variance of 0.41% throughout the year and remained strong at 25.1 million XRP on the 12th of July. Derivatives Data Shows Positive Sentiment According to the report, Derivatives data indicate that XRP’s positive funding rate remained steady over the past few days, in line with the wider positive market sentiment. The lawsuit news generated a significant rise in speculative interest on the bid side, with a $280 million increase in Open Interest, from $635 million to a high of $913 million across exchanges. Moreover, funding rates reached over 0.03% across exchanges, over three times higher than its baseline level of under 0.01% before the announcement. On the other hand, the funding rate history of XRP shows that speculators trading perpetual contracts have been favoring the upside, with minimal time spent this year in negative funding rate territory. This underscores the positive sentiment of traders for XRP, which was recently rewarded with a large price rise due to the announcement. While it remains to be seen whether XRP will maintain its extremely positive funding rate, it is currently a good standard for gauging positive sentiment within altcoins, given the attention and volume it is generating. Considering the lawsuit’s success, the implications for the market are overwhelmingly positive, and the ruling provides clarity that did not exist before the judgment.

Despite the recent surge in positive sentiment and renewed investor confidence, XRP has experienced a significant price drop. After coming close to reaching the $1 mark, which it has not seen since November 2021, XRP is currently trading at $0.7002, marking a decrease of over 11% in the last 24 hours.

The venture sets its sights on challenging the dominance of centralized exchanges such as Binance by prioritizing user experience, marking a notable shift in the DeFi status quo. Infinex: Reinventing DeFi User Experience The inception of Infinex reflects a crucial shift among blockchain developers. Increasingly, these innovators recognize that improving user experience is key to onboarding new users and expanding the DeFi sector. In a significant departure from typical DeFi user interfaces, Infinex eliminates the need to use a crypto wallet to sign transactions. Instead, it adopts a common approach: users create a username and password. Their private keys, still essential for signing transactions, are stored in their browsers. However, according to Warwick, these keys will not be able to withdraw deposited funds, prioritizing user security. Centralized Exchanges in Infinex’s Sights Warwick has a clear vision for Infinex: directly compete with centralized exchanges like Binance. To achieve this, the exchange needs to balance several factors. It must ensure a user experience on par with centralized counterparts, maintain a genuinely decentralized framework, and address potential security concerhns of storing private keys in the browser. Infinex also recognizes the importance of regulatory compliance. The exchange is defsigned to minimize proprietary components, emphasizing its decentralized foundations and reshaping the traditional concept of liability. Infinex Governance and Operational Design According to details on the project shared via Mirror.xyz, Infinex won't issue its own token for governance purposes. Instead, it will use Synthetix's SNX token to manage its governance. Infinex's initial target market comprises existing crypto traders. To kickstart their trading on Infinex, users will need to deposit either USDT or USDC, both dollar-pegged stablecoins. The exchange is expected to generate revenue from several sources, including trading fees, integration fees from a rewards program, and fees from staking SNX. With the unveiling of Infinex, Warwick brings a fresh perspective to the DeFi sector, placing a premium on user experience. This approach underscores a shift in priorities within the industry and sets a new standard for decentralized exchanges. By focusing on existing crypto traders, Infinex makes a calculated move to attract a significant segment of the market that currently operates on centralized exchanges. The success of this approach will undoubtedly be observed closely by other players in the DeFi sector. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The SEC has previously rejected many Bitcoin ETF applications due to concerns about fraudulent practices and investor protection. Bitcoin has seen a 100% rise from its $15k low and a bullish third wave could push it towards the $40k price region if regulatory news is positive. Peaking at an eye watering $69k a coin in late 2021 amidst a fever pitch of zero to hero success stories and a supposed wave of crypto millionaires and influencers, there was one key ingredient missing in Bitcoin's (BTC-USD) rise, regulation. As crypto's prodigal son looks to make a remarkable bullish turnaround backed by two SEC filings from both BlackRock (BLK) and Fidelity which is seen as an institutional adoption of crypto. One would imagine as these heavy weights pursue an ETF like model for Bitcoin, something will give way eventually. According to Reuters, the SEC raised concerts with Nasdaq in a recent filing for a spot Bitcoin ETF from BlackRock. Over the past few years, the SEC has rejected dozens of spot Bitcoin ETF applications, noting the standards designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative practices and protect investors. Subsequently, the ETF industry is trying to address these concerns. Last Friday, CBOE refilled an application with the SEC for a Bitcoin ETF by Fidelity. That filing named Coinbase (COIN) as the platform that would assist the policing manipulation in the proposed ETF. Over the past year alone, Bitcoin has seen a 100% rise from the $15k low, navigating its way through several banking collapses and of course the demise of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX technically and has now technically posted a higher high to launch a bullish third wave past a rejection on the monthly chart directly towards the $40k price region. So can this bullish move be taken seriously, or is it perhaps a bull trap? From a technical point of view a three wave structure can break out giving a probable target which you can see that I have identified within the structures of various different major US equities of which I have documented with Seeking Alpha, however as t he old saying goes, we don't have a crystal ball, but we can imagine as the press for some form of regulation intensifies, positive news on this front will render this bullish breakout for real. To give a short backstory for Bitcoin, as mentioned at the top of the article, this cryptocurrency topped at $69k in October of 2021. Creating a bearish three wave structure, I was able to identify that the break below $32k would first lead to a target of $14.9k and then $10k should there be no sign of a turnaround at the former. Bitcoin did reach the mid $15k region before showing a three wave pattern on the weekly chart early in 2023 which has now developed into the three wave pattern we will go on to look at in this article. If we look at the chart below we can see the bottoming circa the mid $15k region with quite a bullish move upwards, it wasn't until several months later that the bearish rejection candle was printed which gives way to the possibility of a third wave north should this now wave one two structure be broken above. Bitcoin Monthly Chart (C Trader) Additionally, we can then see the attempt at launching the third wave so far by the piercing of the rejection line at $30.5k. Should this move hold, we can expect firstly $40k and then $46k before we would see the $15k region again. To finalize, I am issuing a buy signal for Bitcoin on the basis that it has technically broken above the $30k rejection, but am mindful that a positive regulatory step could be a factor in both the wave holding and also how quickly it could go to target. I would expect Bitcoin to achieve firstly $40k within the next 30–120 days. About the Three Wave Theory The three wave theory was designed to be able to identify the exact probable price action of a financial instrument. A financial market cannot navigate its way significantly higher or lower without making waves. Waves are essentially a mismatch between buyers and sellers and print a picture of a probable direction and target for a financial instrument. When waves one and two have been formed, it is the point of higher high/lower low that gives the technical indication of the future direction. A wave one will continue from a low to a high point before it finds significant enough rejection to then form the wave two. When a third wave breaks into a higher high/lower low, the only probable numerical target bearing available on a financial chart is the equivalent of the wave one low to high point. It is highly probable that the wave three will look to numerically replicate wave one before it makes its future directional decision. It may continue past its third wave target, but it is only the wave one evidence that a price was able to continue before rejection that is available to look to as a probable target for a third wave.

SEC: New Filings And A Heated Preliminary Hearing,"Summary Coinbase stock surged 24% on July 13 after a U.S. District Court judge ruled in favor of Ripple's sale of XRP on secondary marketplaces. While investor focus was fixed on regulatory developments surrounding XRP, Coinbase went to court yesterday for the first preliminary hearing in the case between the SEC and Coinbase. In a 177-page court document dated June 28, Coinbase made several arguments to dismiss the SEC’s allegations, and I present a few of these major arguments in this article. The SEC, on July 7, filed a response to these arguments raised by Coinbase. Yesterday's preliminary hearing lasted two hours, revealing the direction of the upcoming battle in court. Coinbase Global, Inc. ( COIN ) shares surged more than 24% on July 13 after a U.S. District Court judge ruled that Ripple Lab’s (XRP-USD) sales of XRP - a cryptocurrency – to the public cannot be recognized as a sale of securities, meaning crypto exchanges that provided retail investors with access to trading XRP will not be found guilty of selling securities without registration. Soon after this decision was made public, Coinbase announced that it will re-enable trading for XRP on the XRP network. This court ruling came after the Securities and Exchange Commission sued Ripple Labs in December 2020 alleging that the company raised $1.3 billion through the sale of unregistered digital assets, including XRP. Yesterday’s court decision sent cryptocurrency prices higher, with Bitcoin and Ethereum gaining 4.2% and 6.6%, respectively. The positive market reaction has pushed Coinbase stock to the fairly valued territory, and investors will have to be cautious going forward as some of the company's risks do not seem to be baked into the current market price. While investor focus was fixed on regulatory developments surrounding XRP, Coinbase went to court yesterday for the first preliminary hearing in the case between the SEC and Coinbase. Recent filings and yesterday’s pre-hearing reveal new details about the legal battle between the watchdog and the nation’s largest cryptocurrency platform. New Details Emerge As Coinbase Readies To Defend Itself On June 6, the SEC sued Coinbase alleging that the company sold 13 unregistered securities to retail investors. Coinbase, in return, pledged to defend its business practices in court, saying that its sale of cryptocurrencies does not require registration with the SEC as this process cannot be categorized as a sale of securities. The surge in Coinbase stock on July 13 is understandable given that the recent court ruling in favor of XRP establishes that allowing retail investors to access cryptocurrencies on an exchange marketplace does not constitute a sale of securities. The District judge, however, ruled that Ripple’s institutional sales of XRP were securities contracts as these professional investors knew they were contributing capital to Ripple, although retail investors had no way of knowing whether they were buying XRP from another retail investor or from the company itself. Since Coinbase acts as a marketplace, the company is likely to use this ruling in future court hearings to establish that it did not engage in unregistered securities sales. Overall, this is a positive outcome, but it would be naïve to think the company is out of the woods. Recent filings and court documents show the intensifying battle between the SEC and Coinbase. The watchdog is very likely to come hard at Coinbase to establish its relevance amid the growing importance of digital assets, given that Coinbase argues SEC does not have sufficient jurisdiction to sue the company for allegedly selling unregistered securities to the public. A lot has already been said and written about SEC’s original allegations, so let’s start with Coinbase’s response to these allegations. In a court document dated June 28, Coinbase made several arguments to dismiss the SEC’s allegations. Some of the key arguments from this 177-page document are highlighted below. Coinbase is not a securities exchange or broker but a secondary marketplace. The SEC’s acceptance and approval of Coinbase’s registration statement in 2021 without once suggesting Coinbase must register its operations is contradictory to its recent claims. Six of the 12 crypto tokens that are now being targeted by the SEC claiming they are securities have been on Coinbase’s marketplace even at the time the SEC approved its registration statement. In May 2021, SEC chair Gary Gensler testified before Congress, claiming that the SEC did not have statutory authority to regulate crypto trading and businesses like Coinbase. According to the definitions outlined in the Taft Administration, assets traded on the Coinbase platform cannot be classified as investment contracts. The SEC has expanded its definition of investment contracts in the recent past without a congressional mandate. Going by these arguments, it is evident that Coinbase will defend its case with two major arguments. The company is not involved in primary market activities and therefore cannot be alleged of selling investment contracts and securities. The SEC does not have jurisdiction to regulate digital assets. Things get more heated from here on. The SEC, on July 7, filed a response to these arguments raised by Coinbase. In this 4-page document, the SEC suggests that its approval of Coinbase’s registration statement in 2021 was based on the facts at that time, which may have changed now. Also, the SEC claims that Coinbase discouraged crypto asset issuers from using certain statements that may attract regulatory troubles. The SEC goes on to argue that Coinbase’s definition of an investment contract is flawed. The below excerpt from the SEC’s response to Coinbase sets the tone for the watchdog’s counterargument. Ignoring more than 75 years of controlling law under Howey, Coinbase attempts to construct its own test for what constitutes an investment contract from pre-1933 Blue Sky laws based on common law contracts principles. Coinbase makes two related and equally flawed arguments: (1) an investment contract must be or include a formal, common law contract; and (2) even if a crypto asset is considered an investment contract when it is first offered and sold by an issuer, that same asset cannot be an investment contract when traded between non-issuers on a platform like Coinbase’s because secondary market transactions not involving its issuer are merely “asset sales.” Both arguments are wrong. Now we come to yesterday’s events. No, I’m not talking about the court ruling on XRP anymore. While investor focus was fixed on the events surrounding XRP, Coinbase and the SEC faced off in a preliminary hearing yesterday that lasted two hours. Judge Katherine Polk Faila questioned both parties on various subjects including the definition of an investment contract, the nature of a security, and Coinbase’s staking business. Coinbase reportedly asserted the Major Questions Doctrine and requested the judge to dismiss the case, citing that the SEC does not have jurisdiction over the regulation of digital assets. The Major Questions Doctrine dictates that to decide an issue of major national significance, the action of a court must be supported by clear congressional authorization. According to Axios, Coinbase legal counsel and former co-director of the SEC’s enforcement division Steven Peikin questioned the SEC’s stance by highlighting a speech by former SEC director Bill Hinman in 2018 in which he claimed both Bitcoin and Ethereum were not securities. Takeaway The battle between Coinbase and the SEC is certainly heating up. Although yesterday’s court ruling on XRP paves the way for Coinbase to strengthen its case using it as an example, I believe the company will come under pressure during the court hearing. Although not a legal expert, I also believe Coinbase will be able to come up with a strong defense, which should ultimately help the company shake off regulatory pressures and thrive in the long term. As I have highlighted in many of my previous articles, I believe Coinbase is well-positioned to grow exponentially in the long term, and I prefer investing in Coinbase over any other crypto asset to gain exposure to the crypto sector. That being said, I am wary of investing in Coinbase today, given my belief that a lot of positive news has already been factored into the market price. In contrast, the risk of falling crypto trade volumes, the threat to the company’s staking business and thereby diversification efforts, and growing regulatory troubles are yet to be fully reflected in the current valuation. This calls for investors to be cautious of investing in Coinbase stock today.",NEUTRAL,XRP,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | XRP,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4617192-coinbase-vs-sec-new-filings-and-heated-preliminary-hearing?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/14893528.jpeg

Weakness across the board,"Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) changed hands in the red in Friday mid-afternoon trading, erasing all of its gains from Thursday's huge rally, as attention turned to altcoins after Ripple Labs scored a long-awaited victory in court. The digital token slid 4.2% to $30.05K at 4:24 p.m. ET, after reaching as high as $31.7K in the prior session, when a U.S. District Court judge ruled that Ripple's XRP ( XRP-USD ) is not a security in terms of sales to the general public. That's a big deal because the Securities and Exchange's three-year-old suit against Ripple has raised the prospect that cryptos are in fact securities that fall under the regulator's tough oversight. “This is a great outcome for Ripple and cryptocurrency overall since it solidifies a new path forward for investors who are looking for clarity in digital assets,"" said Joe Endoso, chief operating officer of private investing platform Linqto. Note that the judge on Thursday ruled that XRP ( XRP-USD ) was a security when sold directly to institutions but was a commodity when sold to the public. While this marks a major turning point for the crypto industry, there's likely a long road ahead for full regulatory clarity. Intraday losses were widespread among risk assets, from cryptos to stocks. Two of the three major U.S. stock indices ended the session lower , with the Dow Jones eking out a small gain.

A court case against the SEC could allow the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust to convert to an ETF, the Grayscale Ethereum Fund could follow, eliminating its wider NAV discount. The court's recent Ripple ruling makes it more likely that Ethereum is not considered a security, increasing the chances of Grayscale converting its Ethereum fund into an ETF. Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) is a fund that holds Ethereum (ETH-USD) on behalf of investors. That's not terribly exciting, it carries a 2.5% annual fee, and there are other ways to access the cryptocurrency at lower cost if you wish to. However, the kicker is that legal challenges and a potential ETF conversion could cause the NAV discount to close. The current NAV discount is around 37% so if it were to close, that's a 59% return for investors (assuming no movement in the underlying price of Ethereum - a big assumption). The court's Ripple (XRP-USD) ruling just narrowed the NAV discount, but I would argue perhaps not be enough. Legal Challenge There's an active court case against the SEC with a decision expected in the next few weeks or months that could enable the larger Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to convert into an ETF if Grayscale wins the case, and there are few reasons from basic logic to one of the judge's questions during oral argument that suggest Grayscale may be well positioned to win that case. Definitely, not certain to win, but more likely than not to prevail. I've written a drill-down on the specifics of the legal case here . For the Grayscale Ethereum Fund, that's now very interesting, because both these Grayscale funds look very similar at a high level, holding billions of assets as the category leader, trading at a material discount to NAV and if they convert into ETF structures then the NAV discount drops to effectively zero. Equally, if they don't convert to ETFs and others do, they could lose market leadership to the likes of BlackRock and Fidelity over time, who have signaled based on preliminary ETF filings they could introduce ETFs if the SEC allows it, though those filings have not currently proceeded to ETFs yet based apparently on non-public SEC feedback that they are ""inadequate"". Note On ETF Market Leadership As an aside market leadership within an ETF category generally goes to the ETF that acquires the most assets out of the gate, and such funds generally then persist in the number one position. If Grayscale moves quickly on an ETF and brings over billions in assets, it may be able to transfer a leadership position in a fund to a similar leading ETF position. The reasons for this are a broader liquidity and narrower spreads that come from being the largest fund. That move may be strategically attractive to Grayscale for the long term, assuming crypto grows in relevance over time, even if fees have to come down a bit from the current 2.5% to achieve that outcome. Note On ETFs Trading At Or Close To NAV It's worth being aware that ETFs generally trade to NAV, unlike some other fund structures, since financial intermediaries create/redeem assets of the ETF by buying/selling the underlying assets to smooth out NAV premiums and discounts for ETFs. The current Grayscale funds for Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and Ethereum don't do that, hence the wide discount to NAV. That would likely change with an ETF structure, potentially collapsing today's rather large NAV discounts. The Ripple Ruling Importantly on July 13, the courts ruled that Ripple (another cryptocurrency) was, broadly speaking, not a security, ""because purchasers did not have a reasonable expectation of profit tied to Ripple's efforts"". That's important, the SEC has been guarded on defining whether Ethereum is a security or not, though they have generally referred to Bitcoin as a commodity, not a security. Of course, being a security shouldn't be a bad thing, but in this case, the SEC might go on to argue that it's an unregistered security and that then brings a host of legal problems given the current posture of the SEC toward crypto. It's possible the SEC appeals the ruling. Now with the Ripple ruling, it is more likely that Ethereum is not considered a security given its similarities with Ripple. Hence, if Bitcoin has success with its court case for a Bitcoin ETF, after today's legal decision, it may be easier for Grayscale to convert its Ethereum fund into an ETF if it chooses to, and there have been some Ethereum ETFs filings recently showing interest in this area, although the SEC has not approved them. Previously, even if Grayscale won its case against the SEC for a Bitcoin ETF, there was considerable risk that Ethereum would not be able to follow suit because the SEC would use arguments concerning how Ethereum was potentially a security to block any sort of ETF filing for Ethereum. Now that seems like a harder path for the SEC to pursue, though of course, they may find other angles. The Risks With Grayscale Ethereum Trust Still, there are likely two good reasons for the Grayscale Ethereum Trust to trade at a wider discount to NAV than the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. Grayscale is fighting a court case to convert its Bitcoin Trust to an ETF. That implies an ETF conversion is likely if it wins. It hasn't shown the same public conviction for their Ethereum Fund, though it certainly explored an Ethereum futures ETF in May 2023 . So there's perhaps not identical conviction, but still some degree of momentum behind the Ethereum ETF concept. The court case really hinges on the SEC's apparent inconsistency in allowing an ETF based on Bitcoin futures, such as the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) and others, to trade, but blocking ETFs based on spot Bitcoin. In contrast, the SEC has been consistent in blocking all Ethereum ETFs. Yes, such ETF/ETPs exist in Canada and Europe currently, but not in the U.S. I supposed the next issue for the SEC may be there is (theoretically) an inconsistency between allowing a Bitcoin ETF (if they do) and not an Ethereum ETF after today's ruling suggesting that Ripple (and hence Ethereum) are not securities, like Bitcoin, but we aren't there yet. The SEC May Have To Pick Its Battles If you're a regulator, it's not a good look for the courts to reverse your decisions. It ultimately diminishes the effectiveness and predictability of the regulator. The SEC may be facing this issue with crypto. Yes, it wants to protect investors from fraud. However, it must do so in a coherent and consistent way. It may have to give up the battle on blocking ETFs associated with well-established cryptocurrencies. That may enable it to go after smaller and riskier schemes with more force, or to focus on other players such as Coinbase where legal action is pending. Investment Considerations Currently, the discount on the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust has narrowed to around 30% at the time of writing. Whereas the discount on the Grayscale Ethereum Trust is currently around 37% (note prices are volatile). The ruling on Ripple suggests that the chances of an Ethereum ETF are more correlated to a Bitcoin ETF than we previously thought. Therefore, if you're interested in investing in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust based on the chances of a favorable ruling from the courts on ETF conversion, after today's ruling, the Grayscale Ethereum ETF may be worth a look too. That may also diversify your underlying crypto exposure if you aren't committed to Bitcoin. Simple Outcomes Then, if converted to an ETF and trading at NAV, this is what your returns would look like. Fund NAV Discount Return if Traded at NAV Grayscale Ethereum Trust -37% +59% Grayscale Bitcoin Trust -30% +43% Of course, the NAV discount could well widen if Grayscale loses their SEC case, and the swings in value of crypto assets will significantly impact valuations too. Risks Grayscale could lose its court case against the SEC. That would likely cause the NAV discount for all their larger fund-based crypto products to widen. This article focuses on discounts to NAV, but the underlying NAV is highly volatile and a fall in the price of crypto assets could result in losing money even if the NAV discount narrows. It's quite possible Grayscale decides to keep its fund products in their current fund structures and don't convert them to ETFs, even with a favorable legal ruling. These trusts are generally high-fee products (2.5% of NAV annually in the case of Grayscale Ethereum Trust) those fees could erode your capital as you wait for a legal verdict or other events.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4617189-after-ripple-ruling-grayscale-ethereum-trust-becomes-more-interesting-as-nav-discount-play?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/14893436.jpeg

42393099,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgFqrT,1689365317,"XRP Moves Into the Weekly Spotlight, Dwarfing Other Crypto Assets","XRP’s performance has pushed BTC and ETH from center stage for the time being.  A favorable U.S. District Court ruling led to XRP’s second largest daily move in its history.  Bitcoin and Ether remain in a significant uptrend according to CoinDesk Indices indicators  While bitcoin and ether generally comprise the lion’s share of conversation in crypto markets, a ruling in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, pushed another digital asset onto center stage this week.  Ripple Labs’ XRP token rose sharply this week as courts determined that the sale of XRP tokens on exchanges and through algorithms do not constitute investment contracts. The impact of the ruling was substantial, with XRP jumping 73% following the announcement.  For historical context, the upturn is the second largest daily increase in the asset’s history, second only to an 83% move on Dec. 14, 2017.  The XRP move dwarfs the bitcoin and ether’s respective -0.33% and 2.7% performance this week, nudging its two larger contemporaries to the background for the time being. The surge raised XRP’s market capitalization to $41 billion, moving it past BNB into fourth place among largest crypto assets. The asset still remains far-removed from its all-time high of $3.38, but the ruling effectively amounts to a re-pricing of the asset.  Not surprisingly, the relative strength index (RSI) for XRP moved to levels traditionally considered as overbought, as it shot to 88 before retreating slightly to 80. An asset is generally considered to be overbought if its RSI is above 70.  XRP’s 88 reading is the 10th highest in the asset’s history. On the 11 occasions when XRP’s daily reading has hovered between 79 and 81, it has gained 29.5% in the ensuing 30 days.  The question investors must answer is whether they expect XRP’s RSI to decline further, or if the ruling marks a new beginning for XRP, leading to a sustained move higher.  XRP prices retraced by a moderate amount in Friday trading, declining 15% in line with a decrease in crypto prices across the board. BTC and ETH fell by 4.2% and 4.6%, respectively.  XRP strength reflected in CoinDesk Indices  CMI rose as much as 6.8% this week with 172 out of 186 CMI assets finishing the week in positive territory. While XRP was the clear leader, Stellar Lumens (XLM) was the number two performer in the CMI, up 48.6%. XLM’s performance often mirrors XRP’s as both assets are highly correlated, historically.  Among the five CMI sectors, DeFi led the way, rising 11.4%. The leading three DeFi names were LQTY (41.9%), COMP (28.8%), and SNX (28.7%).  Ironically, the currency sector of which XRP and XLM belong, was the laggard, with bitcoin (2.9%) and bitcoin cash (-3.8%) dragging on the sector’s performance.  Bitcoin, Ether in “Significant Uptrend”  Despite taking a backseat to XRP and XLM this week, bitcoin and ether holders still have reason to be pleased.  The Coindesk Indices trend indicators for both assets remain in a “significant uptrend” territory, with BTC’s phase now entering its 23rd consecutive day. Ether has been seesawing between “uptrend” and “significant uptrend.” The late Friday weakness in both assets may lead to a downgrade in their current signal however.",POSITIVE,ETH | XLM | XRP,BCH | ETH | MARKET | XLM | XRP,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/14/xrp-moves-into-the-weekly-spotlight-dwarfing-other-crypto-assets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/eaf62b776ee04ddc11fd7ed9dacb78c24110b505-1044x454.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Canadian firm aims to leverage its vast Nvidia graphics processing unit (GPU) fleet to tap into burgeoning opportunities in AI and cloud computing. An Evolved Focus In a statement issued on July 12, Hive Digital revealed that the updated brand better represents the company's current focus. In the burgeoning era of GPU cloud technology, Hive is poised to expand its Nvidia GPU-oriented revenue channels while also contributing to AI advancements that propel the new Web3 ecosystem. We're excited to announce that today we officially changed our name to 𝗛𝗜𝗩𝗘 𝗗𝗶𝗴𝗶𝘁𝗮𝗹 𝗧𝗲𝗰𝗵𝗻𝗼𝗹𝗼𝗴𝗶𝗲𝘀.

In addition to crypto mining, Hive will offer rental services of GPU server clusters and introduce a new service, HIVE Cloud. The service targets small and medium-sized businesses, offering them an efficient and cost-effective alternative to major cloud service providers. From Crypto Mining to AI Cloud Services Established in 2017, Hive has been a pioneer in the cryptocurrency mining sector. Despite maintaining a strong presence in Bitcoin mining, the company sees tremendous potential in leveraging its 38,000 Nvidia GPU fleet for large-scale computational tasks. Hive has been using these high-performance GPUs to mine Ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network. However, since Ethereum transitioned to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism in September 2022, reducing the profitability of mining, the company has been exploring other revenue streams for its GPUs. Hive's rebranding comes as several mining companies pivot from their original blockchain-focused models. Earlier this year, Riot Blockchain, a Bitcoin mining firm, rebranded to Riot Platforms to reflect its diversified business operations. Projected Market Impact In an official press release, Hive's Executive Chairman, Frank Holmes, expressed optimism for the AI sector's potential, highlighting large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT as a driving factor. According to Holmes, the high-margin business opportunity with their Nvidia GPU cards could generate over $100,000,000 in annual revenues.

42393095,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgFqHZ,1689364221,Could the Ripple Ruling Spell the End of Regulation by Enforcement?,"The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently had a no-good, very bad day because of a district judge’s ruling in the SEC’s action against Ripple’s XRP token. Despite issuing a statement filled with bravado and the kind of detachment from reality that might make even Donald Trump think twice before pressing send, the SEC likely knows how serious of a rebuke its overall approach to crypto received in a federal court. If the ruling holds, we may be witnessing the beginning of the end of SEC Chair Gensler’s regulation-by-enforcement approach to crypto assets, and the end will be messy for those who oppose crypto.  Who could have seen that coming? It was entirely predictable to many, except for a tiny cauldron of activists in Washington, D.C. who adopted the view that “all tokens are securities” with a religious fervor. While the SEC will most assuredly appeal the district court’s decision, action in the courts will take months and are merely a sideshow to a larger reality, namely, the district court’s ruling. And what great timing as the policy debate in Congress is advancing their legislation to put a regulatory framework around crypto assets.  John Rizzo is senior vice president for public affairs at Clyde Group and a former spokesperson for the U.S. Department of the Treasury.  To understand why the policy debate has changed and its import on what rules tokens will be required to abide by, one must consider the long, winding road that crypto policy has traveled.  The desire to bring crypto assets into a regulatory perimeter has long been supported by many Republicans and Democrats in Washington. The thinking, which I observed when I served as a senior spokesperson at the U.S. Department of the Treasury and before that as a senior aide on Capitol Hill, was that crypto assets – love them or hate them – were here to stay and required regulatory frameworks that would mitigate risks, such as fraud perpetrated against consumers, illicit finance and destabilizing runs.  The realist strategy of regulating rather than attempting to ban crypto ran headlong into a desire by some in D.C. to achieve a policy outcome of eradicating crypto. These forces sought to throw sand in the gears of any legislation bringing a comprehensive crypto regulatory framework into law by asserting that crypto assets were merely securities offered by market participants who refused to comply with the law. The assertion that “most crypto tokens are securities” laid the groundwork for the SEC to achieve the anti-crypto crowd’s policy aims through regulatory means.  As of early 2023, the SEC’s regulation by enforcement spree remained untouched by the courts. Those who favored stifling crypto in America could persuasively argue to congressional Democrats, who are needed for any bipartisan crypto deal, that legislation was unnecessary and potentially harmful.  Tables turned  Ironically, with the district court’s ruling ramming a hole through the SEC and the anti-crypto crowd’s strategy, crypto opposers may be forced to accept a legislative agreement more permissive to crypto assets than would have been enacted during the previous Congress, one which Democrats controlled.  Instead of a regulatory framework for crypto assets designed and passed by a Democratic Congress and implemented by a Democratic administration, Democrats may be forced to accept an agreement drafted by congressional Republicans on the House Financial Services Committee. With the SEC and anti-crypto Democrats deprived of the argument that their legal cases were sound, there’s nothing to stop an acceleration of efforts to cinch a bipartisan agreement on a regulatory framework for crypto assets.  The SEC and those who support its approach are likely concerned that this no-good, very bad day becomes no-good, very bad days. A string of court losses with similar legal reasoning as yesterday’s ruling in the Ripple case would weaken anti-crypto Democrats' negotiating hand further. One takes this risk when placing all their betting chips on a novel legal strategy. When you lose, you lose significantly, and the other side of the debate understands that your negotiating leverage worsens by the day.  Far from achieving the end of crypto in America, the SEC’s attempt to cripple crypto in America may lead to a bipartisan regulatory framework that engrains crypto more deeply into the economy than once thought possible – a bad day for those who banked on a strategy of killing crypto assets in America, indeed.",NEUTRAL,XRP,EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | XRP,John Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/07/14/could-the-ripple-ruling-spell-the-end-of-regulation-by-enforcement,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fe638310dafac2ca64e123894776489596b32bd0-4179x2351.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42393106,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgFrBz,1689363407,"DeFi Lender MarginFi Fuels Growth With Loyalty Points, Spurring Talk of ‘Solana Renaissance’","Delta’s frequent flyers earn miles for flights. Wawa convenience stores give loyal customers discounted hoagies. MarginFi, a lending platform for cryptocurrencies on the Solana blockchain, also has a points-based rewards program.  What are the points for? MarginFi won’t say. But many users told CoinDesk they’re convinced points will turn into potentially lucrative tokens. This belief is spurring droves of airdrop farmers to borrow and lend on the Solana ecosystem’s fastest-growing protocol.  That’s paying dividends for MarginFi. The protocol is experiencing its strongest growth ever after incentivizing user activity with points. This two-week-old experiment in gamification has nearly quadrupled MarginFi’s total value locked (TVL), breaking the $10 million mark earlier this week.  While hardly earth shattering on a relative basis – MarginFi is the 14th largest protocol by TVL on a chain whose entire ecosystem is 85 times smaller than Ethereum’s – the program is turning into a bright spot for certain corners of Solana-based DeFi. Some of the more bullish observers think it holds the makings of a second “Solana Summer,” a season of growth.  “We’ve been in a bear market for the past year and a half, but we’re starting to see things blow up again in the right direction,” said Christian Cuffy, head of business development for cybersecurity firm OtterSec, on a Twitter spaces on Wednesday.  MarginFi airdrop?  MarginFi’s points system tracks “how much a user has contributed to the ecosystem’s success,” according to a July 3 blog post. The program rewards borrowers with four points per dollar deposited, while lenders get one-for-one. The longer the term, the more points earned.  ""The idea is to quantify participation within the mrgn economy,"" said the project's lead engineer Jakob Povsic. ""We’ve identified some behaviors, some attributes"" worth incentivizing – namely borrowing and lending. ""It seems like points are motivating people to participate.""  MarginFi founder Edgar Pavlovsky declined to comment on speculation the points would lead to a token airdrop.  Other crypto projects have relied on point systems as a metric for distributing tokens to users. Communities can use these governance tokens to vote on how a protocol operates. Some protocols believe this process helps them “decentralize,” a core ethos of crypto.  Of course, there’s the free-money angle. Tokens are volatile and potentially lucrative assets that recipients can try to sell for a gain. One MarginFi user who goes by the pseudonym BigPaperHand said they are “farming a lot of points” because they believe it will lead to a windfall airdrop that they plan to sell when SOL rallies back to all time highs.  SOL is trading around $30, nearly 90% off the heights reached during the late 2021 bull market. It's currently sitting at levels seen right before the start of that year’s “Solana Summer,” when the blockchain’s buzzing ecosystem was an industry-wide focus.  Moon juice  Points are fueling record growth for MarginFi, according to data compiled by blockchain infrastructure company Hello Moon: The platform more than doubled its user base in less than two weeks.  Many of the users are depositing liquid staking tokens (LSTs) that represent the SOL they’ve locked up with validators to chase 7% interest, Hello Moon’s data shows.  “People just want to get something into MarginFi,” said employee Anders Jorgensen, explaining that LSTs have the best yield for those who don’t want to fully part with their SOL tokens. He called them “the obvious answer for what to deposit” in search of points.  Walker Guffey, the founder of Hello Moon, said MarginFi’s growth hack comes as the Solana ecosystem broadly embraces LSTs, repeating an arc first seen in Ethereum DeFi. The twin trends “amplifying each other and planting the seeds for what appears to be a renaissance in Solana DeFi.”  Two of the biggest LSTs on Solana, from Jito (jitoSOL) and Marinade (mSOL), have grown 47% and 18%, respectively, since MarginFi began its points program on July 3. MarginFi’s jitoSOL pool is the second-largest holder of that token with nearly 15% of total supply.     Growing pains  MarginFi alone won’t be enough to drive all of Solana back up. It can only take so many tokens before things start to get messy.  “If anything we're slightly nervous because we're almost hitting the caps of what the ecosystem can handle liquidity-wise,” MarginFi’s Anders said in a Twitter spaces Wednesday.  Crypto loans platforms need to be able to liquidate the collateral of borrowers who default on their debts. But Solana’s trading landscape is a bit thin these days, meaning lending protocols like MarginFi need to limit certain token deposits to levels they can “safely liquidate on-chain,” as Anders said.  One token that keeps hitting the max is bSOL, the LST issued by Solana validator service SolBlaze. The 5,000 bSOL tokens currently deposited on MarginFi represent nearly 7% of all bSOL tokens in existence; even more are waiting on the sidelines, said the pseudonymous founder of SolBlaze (who goes by SolBlaze). The founder is cutting trading deals across Solana DeFi to increase bSOL’s prominence, and thus its liquidity, and therefore its caps on MarginFi.  “There’s a new bSOL-SOL liquidity pool on Meteora, new incentives on three bSOL dual-LST liquidity pools on Orca, and a new Kamino vault launching later this week,” the SolBlaze founder said in a Telegram message. BSOL’s liquidity is up nearly 400% since it listed on MarginFi.  Liquidity hack  For MarginFi to keep growing it needs more liquidity in the Solana ecosystem – the same problem for all of Solana DeFi. Maybe even for the price of SOL, the coin of the realm. If more people are building things that other people need SOL to use, then more people will buy SOL in order to use the things the builders are building.  “Something needs to be the spark that lights up the fireworks,” said Marius George Ciubotariu, the project lead for Solana-based stablecoin protocol Hubble. “Airdrops and points help with that as it kickstarts the rotation play into Solana.”  On Thursday, Cypher, a trading protocol that often collaborates with MarginFi, announced it would soon roll out its own points system to incentivize growth.  “If your protocol is in DeFi and you aren't doing something to incentivize activity, you are basically a detriment to the ecosystem,” Barrett, the founder of Cypher, said in the Wednesday Twitter Spaces.",POSITIVE,SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | SOL | TRADING | AIRDROP,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/07/14/defi-lender-marginfi-fuels-growth-with-loyalty-points-spurring-talk-of-solana-renaissance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7c3134e6ff41bd962e32ac7f78cbe206723eefa3-4603x2589.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This momentous decision comes as a result of the exchanges reevaluating their previous delisting of XRP, showcasing a renewed confidence in the token’s regulatory standing. This was brought about by the recent landmark court ruling by Judge Analisa Torres. Coinbase, Kraken, And Bitstamp Reinstate XRP Trading Coinbase, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, wasted no time in announcing the resumption of XRP trading following the court ruling. Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, expressed the exchange’s decision in a tweet, stating: “Coinbase will re-enable trading for XRP (XRP) on the XRP network. Do not send this asset over other networks or your funds may be lost. Transfers for this asset remain available on @Coinbase & @CoinbaseExch.“ Related Reading: Ripple Eyes Tokenized Assets Sector As It Expects Market Cap To Reach $30 Trillion The reinstatement of the digital asset on Coinbase’s platform marks a significant shift in their position after delisting the token in January 2021. Kraken, another prominent exchange, also confirmed its plans to reinstate trading for the cryptocurrency, as Marco Santori, Kraken’ Legal Officer tweeted stated: “1/ This morning, the Federal Court for the Southern District of New York ruled that XRP is not a security. As such, just a few minutes ago, Kraken re-enabled trading in XRP for US users.” Bitstamp, an early adopter of XRP, joined the bandwagon, emphasizing its role as a leading liquidity venue for the asset globally as it confirms the return of the token on its exchange for US users. Token holding majority of gains from Thursday | Source: XRPUSD on TradingView.com Ripple’s Legal Battle And Market Impact The court ruling stems from the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple, which accused the company of conducting an unregistered securities offering through the sale and distribution of XRP. Ripple chose to fight the lawsuit, investing substantial resources into the legal proceedings. The outcome of this case carries significant weight for the cryptocurrency industry, as it determines the regulatory oversight faced by digital asset firms. Although Judge Torres’ recent summary judgment concluded that while Ripple’s initial sale of XRP to institutional investors could be classified as a securities offering, the subsequent trading of the tokens on crypto exchanges did not fall under the same classification. Related Reading: Fund Manager Vanguard Increases Stake In Bitcoin Mining Stocks To $600 Million This ruling provides a level of clarity regarding the regulatory status of the token and sets a precedent for similar cases involving other cryptocurrencies. The market responded with enthusiasm to the court ruling as XRP experienced a surge in value, rising by over 75% compared to its price at the beginning of Thursday. Coinbase’s share prices also witnessed a significant jump of more than 24% following the ruling.

Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, fell below $30,000, down more than 5% from a high of about $31,800 at one point on Thursday.  Ether (ETH) also sagged from its rousing Thursday to change hands at $1,900, a 4% decline. The second largest crypto in market value had previously soared past $2,000 to hit a three-month high.  XRP was trading at about $0.69, or down 25% from a peak of $0.93 hit yesterday. The token briefly toppled Binance’s BNB as the fourth largest cryptocurrency by market cap, but slipped back to fifth in the ranking after today's price drop.  Other major altcoins were mostly lower, including ADA and MATIC – the tokens of smart contracts platforms Cardano and Polygon, respectively – each off more than 5% Friday afternoon, though still higher over the last two days. The CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of crypto markets performance, was down about 4% over the past 24 hours.  “[Bitcoin is] still trading like an instrument in consolidation,” wrote Craig Erlam, senior market analyst for foreign exchange market maker Oanda, in an email to CoinDesk.

42393093,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgFq7J,1689360340,Ripple's Legal Win Means It's Time for Crypto to Stand Up to the SEC,"Yesterday, a day of no particular importance during the depths of a brutal bear market when crypto has been kicked around by seemingly everyone, the steeple bells peeled in goblin town.  On Thursday, the news spread quickly across Crypto Twitter, Slack, Discord and Telegram that a federal judge of the vaunted United States District Court for the Southern District of New York had reviewed the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission's (SEC) years-long case against Ripple Labs and determined that it fell short in many respects.  Bill Hughes is the director of global regulatory matters at ConsenSys.  When the SEC publicly commented on the historic decision, it put on the bravest face it could muster. The agency puffed that the court agreed with its claim that heavily negotiated contracts for XRP tokens between Ripple and various institutional investors were securities under the “Howey test,” and that Ripple had fair notice that those contracts needed to be registered with the SEC to be lawful. Ripple’s interpretation of Howey was also expressly rejected by the court, the SEC sniffed, and the agency would “continue to review the decision.”  This carefully drafted pat-on-the-back contained so much spin that the SEC’s public affairs office must remain nauseous even today.  See also: Ripple Labs Ruling Throws U.S. Crypto-Token Regulation into Disarray | Opinion  The SEC, tellingly, elided everything in the decision that is clearly damaging to the SEC’s current approach to crypto. The SEC undoubtedly knew immediately how big a debacle this decision is for them, and what a boon it is to not just the legal position but also spirit of an industry that the SEC has sought to crush under its well-polished wingtip since the condemnable implosion of FTX.  A welcome surprise  One wonders how surprised the SEC Division of Enforcement and chairman were at this decision, and what their first thoughts were. Was it possibly remorse about choosing to drop years-long discussions with the industry in favor of scorched earth litigation? About not pursuing a legislative or rulemaking approach? About actually litigating a strategically critical case to the end rather than doing whatever it takes to settle?  Whatever their thoughts might have been, their surprise was surely no less than that of the broader crypto space, which other than a few strident voices expected Ripple to lose – and lose huge – with potentially calamitous implications for other crypto market players.  This was so surprising in part because this was supposed to be an easy case for the SEC. Ripple raised funds by selling tokens to the public via crypto exchanges, and got people to accept XRP in payment for services, all the while touting that XRP would go up in value.  [W]e are unlikely to see the SEC change its hard charging tactics, despite growing discomfort among SEC staff.  If Ripple did not run afoul of the Securities Act of 1933 in its dealings, and the XRP token was not proven to be a security, then what’s the likelihood the SEC will be successful convincing other courts that other tokens are securities, or that secondary market crypto trading is regulated activity? The chances are now far worse than they were two days ago.  What the decision is not  There are many things that this decision is not. It is not a blanket repudiation of the SEC’s legal theories about crypto. It does not toll the end of the Gensler chairmanship. It is not controlling precedent for other cases. This is but one district court, and its conclusions and reasoning are to some extent limited to the specific dispute before it. Other judges in the same courthouse, let alone federal judges across the country, can disagree with or ignore this decision.  See also: The SEC Is Fighting the Last War | Opinion  It does not even permanently resolve the specific legal issues on which the judge ruled, because the SEC can at some point appeal. Whether there will be an appeal is to be seen. The SEC may wish to set the Ripple case, a long, exhausting and expensive litigation, aside in favor of a new cohort of cases that this chairman and his staff actually had a hand in building. That may be the more politically shrewd course of action, but it is more likely the SEC will try to immediately appeal this decision to the nationally influential Second Circuit, where the agency has an impressive track record of wins.  This decision is already the subject of legal criticism from many sides, including some who applaud the result. But even if the case is appealed and the Second Circuit reverses some if not all of the district judge’s findings in favor of Ripple, we are talking about months if not years of additional litigation at both the district and appellate levels, all of which holds profound risk for the SEC.  Impacts everywhere  During that time, the SEC will find that its regulation-by-enforcement strategy has gotten palpably more difficult to execute. Every token issuer, exchange and (eventually) software developer that it hauls on to the carpet to make a public example of should now, if they did not before, have the sand to fight back.  And that’s perhaps the biggest impact of the Ripple decision. It is the boost of confidence the crypto community needed to stick to its guns that the SEC’s legal theory is wrong and its tactics improper.  It also boosts the confidence of the community in its public policy work that the SEC and its benefactors on Capitol Hill seem so committed to undermining. What is the Ripple case but a clarion call for Congress to act? It is time to end the interagency bickering and market uncertainty by finally establishing a regulatory framework that is on all fours with the technology, precisely as other countries are doing. This has failed to happen to date in no small part because some lawmakers accepted the SEC’s assurances that it has things handled.  The Ripple decision shows just how hollow those assurances are. Capitol Hill can no longer escape this question: might the crypto industry and 2021-era Gary Gensler be correct that there is a regulatory gap that needs to be filled through legislation?  Legislation is needed to define the SEC’s mandate. No one seriously believes the SEC should not have a productive regulatory role in U.S. crypto markets. Far from it. The SEC should play a vital role, as it does in the digital asset market structure proposal currently under consideration in Congress. But that role must be one that Congress fashions, not the Commission itself. The Ripple decision thankfully increases the possibility that such legislation is achievable if not this calendar year, then soon. Only then can valid worries about the next FTX be properly put to bed.  Next moves  I expect the SEC not to go gentle into that good night on the policy fight that the chairman chose (or was politically forced, perhaps) to take up in the weeks after the FTX collapse. I do not think that a district judge swatting the SEC on the nose with this decision will engender any introspection or change in character.  See also: Legal Experts Weigh in on Ripple's Partial Victory in SEC Court Fight Over XRP  Gensler’s tough cop routine, which to some extent is precisely the point of this crusade against crypto, cannot be abandoned. That would signal weakness, and weakness is political death. The more likely play of a masterful political operator, which the chair undoubtedly is, is to double down on enforcement and, by doing so, demonstrate strength to all those who might otherwise question whether his strategy and style might be the problem.  For those reasons, I suspect we are unlikely to see the SEC change its hard charging tactics, despite growing discomfort among SEC staff. They will continue to litigate cases against big exchanges, including Coinbase, explaining that the Ripple decision changes nothing about the merits of their theory. They will undoubtedly go after projects in DeFi, and perhaps the time table for doing so has moved up.  And they will hope for as many settlements as they can get.

Following Thursday’s ruling by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York that certain sales and distributions of XRP tokens by Ripple and its executives were not investment contracts, those other defendants may have a new arrow in their quiver.  “This is a significant opinion that has the potential to change the landscape of the SEC’s enforcement efforts, or the success of those efforts,” said Teresa Goody Guillén, a former attorney with the SEC office of the general counsel, and now a partner with law firm BakerHostetler. “This is also helpful precedent for Coinbase and Binance to defend against allegations that they are operating as unregistered securities exchanges, brokers and clearing agencies.”  Several legal experts were quick to pour cold water on the excitement, arguing that the summary judgment may rest on shaky ground, and may not translate to the crypto industry's hoped-for change in the way it's treated by the SEC.  “The SEC will look to the parts of the court decision that are in its favor to justify its continued views on the regulatory status of coins and tokens – i.e., that they are all securities — and its continued approach to enforcing those views on the industry,” Joe Castelluccio, leader of law firm Mayer Brown’s fintech and digital assets, blockchain and crypto groups, wrote in an email.  According to Castelluccio, the portions of the decision that are in Ripple’s favor are “fairly fact-specific, and while there may be some that are similarly situated in the market, others in the market may find it challenging to rely on those portions of the decision if their circumstances do not directly align.”  Castelluccio added that the case ""does not provide regulatory or legal clarity for the numerous other regulatory issues that the digital assets sector is navigating.”  Read more: Ripple Labs Ruling Throws U.S. Crypto-Token Regulation into Disarray  Victory laps  Thursday’s summary judgment by the U.S. Southern District Court of New York ruled that certain sales and distributions of XRP tokens by Ripple and its executives were not investment contracts – and therefore don’t break securities laws – as the SEC alleged in a 2020 civil lawsuit.  The industry latched on to the news that a federal judge had essentially declared token sales on exchanges weren’t investment contracts even though institutional sales of XRP to hedge funds and the like were deemed securities in the same ruling.  “The court rejects the view that cryptocurrency tokens are securities, which has previously led to widespread confusion,” said Jeffrey Alberts of Pryor Cashman LLP, adding that the judge had clarified in her ruling that crypto tokens are not themselves securities.  Congratulations and cries of “LFG” – internet slang for “onward and upward,” at least in the G-rated translation – poured in as CEO Brad Garlinghouse tweeted Ripple was “on the right side of the law, and will be on the right side of history.”  The price of the XRP token surged as high as 96% on Thursday following the news.  ""There’s no way to look at the Ripple decision as anything but a win for the crypto industry. XRP is not a security and the company’s and executives’ transactions in XRP on the secondary market do not violate the securities laws,” ​​Christian Schultz, a former official at the SEC division of enforcement said in an email to CoinDesk.  The good, bad and the complicated  Arthur Jakoby, partner at Herrick, Feinstein LLP, echoed Goody Guillén, saying the ruling undercuts the SEC’s position that secondary sales of digital assets on exchanges such as Coinbase constitute the sale of unregistered securities.  “If upheld on appeal, this decision significantly narrows the SEC’s jurisdiction over the crypto market,” Jakoby said.  While no other district court judges are obligated to follow the reasoning in this ruling, it could “spell problems for the SEC in other pending litigation, particularly those that are focused primarily if not exclusively on secondary market activity,"" according to Schultz.  In addition to sales of XRP on exchanges, other distributions including to employees, and sales of the token by executives Garlinghouse and co-founder Christian Larsen were also ruled not securities.  On the other hand, the fact that institutional sales of XRP were deemed investment contracts supports SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s views that virtually all initial coin offerings (ICO) are securities, Schultz said. ICOs, once a popular fundraising method for crypto startups, offer tokens to the public or privately to investors to raise capital for various projects. Although Ripple has denied conducting a single offering of XRP, the SEC alleges in its suit that Ripple sold approximately $728.9 million of XRP in institutional sales.  “I would expect the crypto industry to look for creative ways to make an initial distribution of digital assets that avoid the facts and circumstances that led to this judge finding there is an investment contract security relating to the digital asset,” Schultz said.  Preston Byrne, corporate partner at law firm Brown Rudnick's digital commerce group, wrote in a CoinDesk op-ed that the ruling – which concluded institutional sales of XRP do constitute investment contracts but other distributions do not, essentially assigning two regulatory states to one token – may be flawed and vulnerable to overturn if the SEC decided to appeal the decision.  Although Thursday’s ruling was in response to motions for summary judgment by the SEC and Ripple to stop the case from proceeding to trial, parts of the requests that were denied – which include the institutional sales of XRP – will proceed to trial.",NEUTRAL,XRP,EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | XRP | TOKEN SALE,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/07/14/what-ripples-partial-xrp-win-means-for-other-crypto-firms-fighting-sec,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e54cbb0e722a9abb70fd64e766ed1681b29b36f3-2400x1350.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42393086,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgFphf,1689358449,Is the Metaverse a 'Global Panopticon'?,"Without question, new and advanced technologies such as emotion detection and affect recognition technologies, neurotechnologies, and XR and other metaversal technologies, among others, raise significant privacy-related concerns. Each new category of technology penetrates a layer deeper into our personal space, threatening to erode the boundaries of our inner lives and inner selves.  This article was excerpted from ""Beyond Data: Reclaiming Human Rights at the Dawn of the Metaverse,"" by Elizabeth M. Renieris.  Moreover, the rendering and datafication of these activities into digital information raises traditional and novel data protection concerns, despite the inadequacies of existing laws that pertain to personal data and frequently require the identifiability of individuals. And whereas conventional legal frameworks typically regard privacy as an individualistic concern, new and emerging technologies increasingly have implications for individuals, groups and society as a whole too.  Extended reality (XR) technologies are a clear example of the simultaneously personal and collective nature of these privacy concerns. In order to fuse virtual and physical or “real-world” components together, XR technologies typically involve the collection and use of biometric identifiers and measurements, real-time location tracking and “always-on” audio and video recording technologies that create detailed, live maps and models of spaces or places and record ambient sounds.  From the perspective of an individual using the technology, XR devices tend to capture information about the individual’s voice or vocal tone, iris, pupil movements and gaze, gait and other body movements, location information, device information and identifiers, and more, raising obvious concerns about the privacy and security of data harvested about that individual.  These technologies are, by definition, designed to alter or extend reality.  These practices also raise concerns about the personal privacy and security of individuals insofar as these technologies can be used to track and surveil them.  Apart from the privacy risks to an individual using these technologies, such as by wearing an XR headset or glasses, they introduce significant risks to nonusers and other people who may be implicated through interactions with that individual in both the virtual and physical worlds. For example, “always-on” recording devices and cameras are likely to capture the images, movements, voice, conversations and other sounds of unknowing and unwitting bystanders.  Where combined with advanced biometric identification systems, such as facial or voice recognition technologies, they might also locate and specifically identify individuals in the surrounding area without their knowledge or consent, and in turn, without any opportunity to opt out.  At present, there are few laws or regulations that account for these scenarios. As a result, as the Electronic Frontier Foundation cautions, we could end up in a “global panopticon society of constant surveillance in public or semi- public spaces.” XR technologies illustrate the contextual and interpersonal nature of our privacy challenges too, and the need for a more collective approach in a postdigital world.  See also: Why It Feels Good to Be Bad in the Metaverse | Opinion  But the concerns with respect to metaversal technologies such as XR run much deeper than what we traditionally conceive of as privacy challenges. These technologies are, by definition, designed to alter or extend reality. As such, they are inherently powerful tools for manipulation and discrimination.  Depending on the reality individuals are exposed to, they might be persuaded, manipulated or coerced into choices, behaviors or activities against their own best interests, and often unknowingly. While this phenomenon already exists in the digital media and information landscape, such as with respect to algorithmic systems for personalization and behavioral targeting, XR and similar technologies could further amplify and exacerbate the so-called filter bubble effect.  Moreover, individuals who exist in the same physical space may experience different versions of “reality,” depending on their gender, race, socioeconomic status and other protected or sensitive attributes (and, potentially, depending on their ability to pay for the latest or best XR technologies).  In these ways, such technologies pose a direct threat to the values of personal autonomy, human dignity, choice, consent and self- determination – values that often underlie concerns about privacy and are central to functioning democratic societies.

The U.S. Southern District Court’s ruling in partial favor of payments network Ripple represents a landmark win for the crypto industry and provides clarity as to what does and doesn’t represent a security, investment bank JMP Securities wrote in a research note Friday.  “Large capital pools have been reticent to engage in the industry with unclear rules of the road, while the related overhang has also slowed innovation, adoption, and just overall crypto ecosystem valuation, in our opinion — accelerating as regulatory actions heated up over the past year,” analysts wrote.  “This ruling is undoubtedly a milestone win for the industry.

While Ripple’s win is certainly positive, JMP also noted that this isn’t the end of the regulatory fight for the crypto industry, as the SEC can appeal the ruling and will also likely continue to pursue similar cases in the future.  “We do believe the industry has now established stronger ground for the time being which could affect ongoing cases, and also the pace of further litigation, but at a high level, we do not think the regulatory overhang simply disappears, it just lessens,” the note stated.

The trading volume of XRP pairs on centralized exchanges grew by a staggering 1351% on Thursday compared to the previous day, Josh de Vos, research lead of crypto analytics firm CCData, noted.

The momentous win sees XRP become the first crypto with regulatory clarity and may be the catalyst to end the ongoing crypto winter. July 13, 2023, becomes a date that many investors and people interested in the crypto market will remember. Judge Analise Torres of the Southern District of New York handed a partial win over to Ripple Labs after its three-year-long battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Crypto Industry Gets a Win Amid Regulatory Crusades Per the ruling issued by Judge Torres, Ripple’s native $XRP token is “not necessarily a security on its face.” The decision declared that Ripple’s XRP sales on public crypto exchanges were not offers of securities because buyers did not have a reasonable expectation of profit tied to Ripple’s efforts, Reuters reports. In 2020, the SEC sued Ripple, alleging it violated US securities laws leading many exchanges, such as Coinbase and Kraken, to delist XRP. Judge Torres’ ruling sets a precedent for crypto regulation leading to a shift in market momentum. Shortly after the decision was made public, Bitcoin and altcoins surged to highs after what seemed to be a never-ending market slump after the FTX collapse. Bitcoin reached a one-year high, up more than 90% for the year and almost 30% in the past month. XRP, which may now be legally sold on public cryptocurrency exchanges, skyrocketed over 70% over the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinMarketCap, XRP was trading at $0.78 at the time of writing. 2023 has been plagued by a string of regulatory attacks on the industry, mostly from the SEC. The agency recently sued crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase and labelled several cryptocurrencies as securities and trading platforms, such as Robinhood, to delist the tokens. The SEC further took issue with recent Bitcoin spot ETF applications. The crypto market has largely fallen victim to negative press, leading to declining consumer confidence. Ripple’s win, however, may garner some positive momentum in the industry. Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone brokerage in Melbourne, commented in an article published by Reuters: We'd gone through this long period of just consistently negative news to make the space look pretty grimy.

PEPE Whale Has Deposited $7.2 Million To Binance According to data from the cryptocurrency transaction tracker service Whale Alert, a massive PEPE transfer has occurred on the Ethereum blockchain during the past day. The transaction in question involved the movement of 3.94 trillion PEPE, which was worth almost $7.2 million at the time the transfer went through on the network. Generally, only the whale entities are capable of making such large moves, so it’s reasonable to assume that a whale investor would have been behind this transfer. Due to the massive amount of capital involved in transactions of these humongous investors, they can sometimes cause noticeable fluctuations in the price of the asset. As such, the movements of the whales can be something to watch out for. How such transfers may affect the market, though, depends on the exact intent the investor had behind it. Related Reading: Perfect Storm: Why Bitcoin & Crypto Are Poised For A Dramatic Recovery Here are some additional details regarding the relevant PEPE whale transfer, which may shed some light on what the whale wanted to achieve with the move: Looks like this large transfer on the Ethereum blockchain only cost a fee of about $2.5 to go through | Source: Whale Alert As you can see above, the sending address in the case of this PEPE transfer is an unknown wallet, meaning that it’s an address unattached to any known centralized platform, making it likely that it’s the personal wallet of an investor. The receiving address, on the other hand, looks to be a wallet affiliated with a centralized platform. More specifically, this address is connected to the cryptocurrency exchange Binance. Transfers like these, where coins move from self-custodial wallets to exchanges are called “exchange inflows.” As one of the main reasons why investors may deposit their coins to these platforms is for selling-related purposes, exchange inflows can provide hints about the selling pressure in the market. In the current case, as the whale has made a rather large inflow to these platforms, it’s possible that the price of the meme coin may suffer bearish consequences from it. Naturally, this would only be so if the PEPE whale in question truly made these deposits with selling in mind, and not for using any of the other services the Binance platform offers. Though, considering that the exchange inflow has occurred following a rapid 17% rise in the meme coin’s value, there is probably a fair chance that the whale is indeed looking to sell and take advantage of this profitable exit opportunity. Related Reading: XRP Price Retreats After Massive 80% Rally, Buy The Dips? So far, however, the PEPE price has only moved mostly sideways since the whale made the transfer, implying that, if the whale indeed sold the coins, the market currently has enough buying pressure that the selling has simply been absorbed.

The Fir Tree Digital Asset Opportunities Fund will launch Aug. 1, according to an email seen by CoinDesk.  “Fir Tree is at its best when we identify opportunities that are mispriced, dislocated or complex. Rarely do we encounter situations that are all three, but that is precisely what we are seeing in digital assets right now,” Fir Tree wrote.  Fir Tree did not immediately return requests for comment.  Last year was a banner year for crypto collapses and bankruptcies, including the likes of Three Arrows Capital, Voyager Digital, BlockFi, Celsius, FTX and the lending business of Genesis (which, like CoinDesk, is owned by Digital Currency Group).  Fir Tree is not a stranger to crypto, having tried its hand at shorting Tether’s USDT stablecoin and also getting into a legal wrangle with bitcoin fund manager Grayscale (another DCG division).  In its email, Fir Tree pointed out that it has ""no view on the direction of cryptocurrency or the reflation of any coins"" and will try to ""hedge any crypto exposure.""  Fir Tree also said conventional crypto investors don't have the experience needed to navigate ""bankruptcy proceedings or [conduct] effective activist efforts,"" giving Fir Tree an advantage.

42393110,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgG1Cb,1689354123,Hollywood’s Angry Creators Show Why Web3 Is Needed,"This week’s strike by Hollywood actors, who have joined writers on a work stoppage, reflects a hard truth about the Web2 economy: the platform streaming industry’s economics don’t work.  It’s another reminder that everyone involved in creative production should now be looking at Web3 solutions, irrespective of ill-informed media commentary that has stripped the term of its mainstream appeal.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  During the COVID pandemic, a battle for market share saw platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu and Disney Plus fork out big for all manner of content. Now, makers of feature films, TV series and documentaries are being repeatedly shown the door, which is why there’s no money to pay actors or writers.  In music streaming, it’s arguably worse. Spotify now completely dominates the market. Pandora, owned by Sirius XM, is a shadow of its former self, as is Rhapsody, which rebranded to Napster after it acquired the legendary file-sharing service’s name in 2016 and then was acquired by blockchain developer Algorand in 2022. Yet Spotify itself has never made a profit since its founding in 2009. Last year, it posted a $430 million loss, its third biggest ever.  And the musicians? Well, artists reportedly earn a measly one third of a cent from each Spotify stream. During an interview at the Milken Institute, hip hop star Snoop Dog put it succinctly: ”can someone explain to me how you can get a billion streams and not get a million dollars. That s__t don’t make sense.”  If it’s not the platforms or the musicians, then, who are the winners? Maybe it’s the record labels, which a decade ago infamously inked multibillion deals with Spotify and other streaming platforms to license their music. (Spotify recently said total payments it has made on royalties approach $40 billion.)  By keeping so much for themselves and leaving musicians with the dregs – the labels could be killing their own business. New musicians are abandoning them. To make ends meet, they’re working in content marketing, or producing soundtracks for online games or finding other ways to make money that don’t entail entering into a bondage relationship with a label and Spotify.  Many are emphasizing live shows, where they can sell merchandise, get people on their mailing lists and, if their audience members still have the players, directly sell them CDs. But, unless they’re Taylor Swift, live performances leave artists dependent on another monopolistic intermediary: Live Nation Entertainment, the ugly offspring of the Live Nation and Ticketmaster merger.  A new way  Musicians, filmmakers and other creators of content must find a way to bypass these giant, rent-seeking gatekeepers. And, as true believers in digital assets have been saying for some time, Web3 offers them the path to getting there.  For all the hype, bubbles and burst hopes of the non-fungible token (NFT) market these past three years, this innovation contains an undeniable breakthrough: the creation of unique, one-off digital assets, a construct that was impossible in the everything-can-be-replicated internet that preceded it. NFTs are a building block for a more creator-centric system, since they recreate, in the digital realm, the direct peer-to-peer ownership relationship that fans and performers used to have with LPs, books, films and so forth.  Now that we’ve gotten beyond the speculative madness around collectible digital rocks, wildly inflated art and monkey pics, a new breed of innovators is directly tying NFTs and related technology to regular content production. The strategies are not about pumping a limited number of “rare” NFTs in the hope they’ll “moon,” but rather using these unique assets as an access key for fans to unlock added value from their engagement with the content. It’s about connecting creators with their audience, adding value, fostering a sense of shared interest and ownership.  There are lots of examples in play.  Aspen, a Web3 platform built by Monax Labs, helped independent singer-songwriter Jeremy Stein, better known by his stage name Steinza, offer concert-going fans who’d acquired his NFTs special privileges such as exclusive access to a virtual screening of his shows and the opportunity to own multimedia memories from the concert.  Web3 gaming company Gala Games has spun up a unit called Gala Film, which deploys NFTs to deliver value to fans who support video productions and uses smart contracts to assure rewards in perpetuity to both creators and fans who financially support them.  In one project, Gala is working with Stick Figure Productions, headed by Emmy Award-winning filmmaker Steven Cantor, to innovatively fund and produce “Four Down.” The documentary, based on “Not Without Hope,” the true story of how Nick Schuyler survived 43 hours on an overturned boat in the Gulf of Mexico after losing three friends that included NFL players Will Bleakley and Marquis Cooper, will generate behind-the-scenes footage and hands-on experiences to which the Gala community will gain exclusive access.  Or, there’s animation studio Toonstar, founded by various cartooning veterans, which is allowing its NFT community to vote on aspects of its projects, including naming and “choose-your-own-adventure” plot outcomes for shows that include The Gimmicks.  Small is OK  Will all these become runaway successes? Of course not. But such has always been the nature of the hit-driven entertainment industry. Some win, some lose.  More importantly, by engaging fans and providing creators with direct connections to them, there’s a shared experience in these projects that can transcend the win-or-lose dichotomy of an industry that is now overly focused on big blockbuster bets. Here is a new path for artists that gives space for smaller projects and the many, many creators working on them.  Sure, “Web3” became a buzzword. And perhaps there’s work to be done to define what models actually fall within it. But to dismiss these innovations is to live under the delusion that the current Web2 economy is working.",POSITIVE,없음,ALGO | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | GALA,Michael J.

More than a third of the staff at Binance – which totaled about 8,000 prior to the layoffs – could eventually be affected by the job cuts, the source said.  A spokesperson for Binance confirmed the layoffs to the WSJ without specifying the exact number.  “As we prepare for the next major bull cycle, it has become clear that we need to focus on talent density across the organization to ensure we remain nimble and dynamic,” the spokesperson said.  A CNBC report later in the day said the cuts will eventually eliminate 1,500 to 3,000 of Binance’s workers globally, and that the cuts would be carried out through the end of the year, citing a current Binance employee familiar with the company’s plans. A Binance spokesperson disputed the 3,000 worker figure, however, according to CNBC, saying it was too high.  CNBC’s report attributed the layoffs to the ongoing probe of Binance by the U.S. Department of Justice, and said the probe is likely to end with either a consent decree or a multi-billion dollar settlement, citing the same current employee as its source.

Powered by Ethereum sidechain Polygon, the Web3 Rewards Tools application aims to help brands create a deeper connection with their customers through non-fungible tokens (NFT) and gamified experiences. Brands can issue token-based rewards, as well as release token-gated products with their own NFT collections and existing projects such as the Bored Ape Yacht Club or CryptoPunks.  Tara Fung, CEO and co-founder of Co:Create told CoinDesk that commerce is a key mechanism to engage the community behind a brand, and Web3 provides the technology for merchants to provide digital ownership to their loyal customers.  “We are building an integrated system that helps the most innovative community centric brands grow, reward and engage their community,” said Fung. “And that is where the Shopify app lives.”  She also noted that commerce helps startups and newer brands build their audiences and engage their communities, as opposed to larger brands rolling out Web3 activations.  “The future of brand engagement and the most exciting brands that people are actually ecstatic about and want to give their advocacy to are often smaller brands that feel very authentic,” said Fung. “Those are the types of brands that are going to want to engage a community more deeply as opposed to utilizing Web3 as just a marketing play.”  While Co:Create’s application is targeted at inducting more brands into Web3 rewards ecosystems, it isn’t the first to do so. In March, Avalanche-based community engagement platform Try Your Best (TYB) released its application on the Shopify app store, allowing brands to implement NFT-based loyalty programs into their storefronts.  Beyond commerce, Co:Create is oriented towards bringing fans closer to the individuals and brands they love through in-person experiences.

14886085,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=542683,1689350415,Here’s What On-Chain Data Reveals About XRP Rally,"XRP has observed a massive 67% rally during the past 24 hours. Here are some facts on-chain data reveals about this price surge. Several Indicators Have Surged Following The XRP Rally In its latest insight post, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has looked into the underlying metrics related to XRP as the cryptocurrency has seen an extremely sharp surge during the last day. This rapid growth in the asset’s value has come following Ripple’s victory in court as XRP has been declared “not a security.” Immediately after the announcement, the coin had managed to rise by around 90%, but in the hours since then, the asset has taken some hit. Nonetheless, the cryptocurrency has still managed to hold onto the majority of its gains so far, as it’s still up 67%. This rise has now made the asset the fourth largest in the space in terms of market cap, as it has leapfrogged past BNB. Following the rally, the “social dominance” of XRP saw a sharp surge toward the 7.4% mark, as the below chart displays. Looks like the metric's value has spiked | Source: Santiment Social dominance measures how the discussions on social media related to any given coin (which, in this case, is XRP) compare against the combined amount of talk the top 100 assets by market cap are receiving currently. At the current value of the metric, 7.4% of all discussions related to these top 100 coins are coming from XRP alone. Such a high amount of interest among social media users is generally a sign of euphoria, which usually leads to a correction in the price. This may explain why the asset has taken a hit since the initial jump. Related Reading: Bitcoin MVRV At Critical Level: Will A Break Happen? In terms of whale activity, the network has naturally been active during this surge, as these humongous investors have made a large number of transactions, as shown below. The value of the metric seems to have been quite high recently | Source: Santiment The number of whale transfers has crossed the 637 mark during the past day, which is the highest level observed in 2023. “Clearly the pump is being fueled by these large transactions,” notes Santiment. The trading volume (the total amount of XRP being transacted on the chain) has also registered a steep increase, which isn’t too surprising considering the high amount of whale activity that has occurred during the past day. The volume has seen a spike | Source: Santiment The current levels of the trading volume are the highest that they have been in around 10 months, further showcasing the extraordinary activity that the blockchain is observing right now.

14886090,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4617128-ripple-ruling-coinbase-might-be-biggest-winner?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1689350414,Ripple Ruling: Coinbase Might Be The Biggest Winner,"Summary U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP tokens sold directly to institutional investors are securities and should have been registered with the SEC. The ruling has implications for Ripple Labs and XRP, with the former having sold unregistered securities, while the latter can continue to be sold to retail buyers. The decision could impact the SEC's lawsuit against Coinbase, as coins listed on the platform cannot be considered securities based on the ruling's language. Of all of the dramatic things that have happened in the cryptocurrency industry in the last 12 to 18 months, the most significant from a long term impact standpoint might be the SEC/Ripple ( XRP-USD ) case decision from U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres on July 13th . Ripple vs the SEC XRP was launched by Ripple Labs in 2012. While XRP has been a somewhat controversial coin in the broader crypto community given the justifiable concerns about centralization, XRP has been among the top 5 to 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization since launch. In 2020, the US Securities and Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit against Ripple Labs for the alleged selling of unregistered securities. The outcome of that suit has been a major regulatory headwind for the broader cryptocurrency market ever since. In her decision, Judge Torres ruled XRP tokens sold directly to institutional investors are securities and should have been registered with the SEC. However, Torres also found that XRP tokens that were acquired by non-institutional investors from secondary sales through exchanges are not securities. Ripple Impact There are different implications here for Ripple Labs and XRP. For Ripple Labs specifically, this is less positive as the judge ruled that the company did sell unregistered securities through closed funding rounds. However, XRP sold to retail buyers can proceed and we're already starting to see exchanges relist XRP. In the chart below, we can see the enormous spike in both coin price and real volume in response to the news. XRP Price & Volume (Messari) This surge is not surprising and is potentially indicative of renewed interest in XRP for cryptocurrency buyers domestically. Even after the SEC's lawsuit was filed in 2020, XRP has still been available on a variety of crypto exchanges; including Binance ( BNB-USD ) and KuCoin. However, several US-based exchanges delisted the token in response to the SEC lawsuit. Most notably, Coinbase ( COIN ) ended trading of XRP in January of 2021 . At the time, Coinbase was the 4th ranked global exchange by trade volume and it has generally been in or near the top 5 since. Following the court ruling from Judge Torres, Coinbase has already indicated it will re-list XRP. XRP Holder Distribution (Santiment) With the top domestic cryptocurrency exchange re-listing XRP, it's worth watching how the coin distribution trend behaves over the next several months. Going back to late early January 2021, we've already seen wallet addresses with 10k-100k XRP coins increase from 106k to nearly 236k today. Coinbase Impact And that brings us to the impact on Coinbase. The SEC sued Coinbase in June. In that suit, the agency alleged the company was operating as a broker, exchange, and a clearinghouse for unregistered securities. This Ripple ruling is very damaging to the SEC's argument because coins listed on Coinbase can't be considered securities based on the language of the Ripple decision: # Name IEOs Raise (sorted) Market Cap 1 Gate.io Startup 328 $ 156.24M $ 3.16B 2 Binance 34 $ 130.72M $ 14.48B 3 OKX Jumpstart 18 $ 55.64M $ 769.84M 4 KuCoin Spotlight 26 $ 45.33M $ 1.13B 5 Bgogo 3 $ 40.73M N/A Source: CryptoRank In the table above, I'm showing the top 5 exchanges by capital raised via Initial Exchange Offering, or IEO. We can see Gate.io and Binance have served as the largest vehicles for capital raised through IEO. There are roughly a dozen others that have raised capital through IEO but to a lesser degree. Notably missing from this table is Coinbase and there's good reason; Coinbase never sold any cryptocurrencies via IEO. Thus, any coins purchased through Coinbase exchange were secondary sales and are not considered securities per the Ripple ruling. To be clear, Coinbase does have a venture capital arm that has invested directly in crypto protocols through closed funding rounds. For instance, Polygon ( MATIC-USD ), Aptos ( APT-USD ), and Lido Finance ( LDO-USD ) received investment from Coinbase Ventures. But because those coins weren't sold directly through Coinbase as ICOs, it's difficult to justify calling those tokens securities based on what judge Torres just decided about XRP. From where I sit, there are two direct impacts from this ruling on Coinbase: The SEC lawsuit against Coinbase just took a major hit Altcoins on Coinbase's exchange are fair game for previously cautious US buyers Given these two points, I believe we could see a spike in exchange volume on Coinbase now that there appears to be more clarity in the US for the time being. Intraday Moves 7/13/23 (Seeking Alpha) The immediate market response to the ruling has been positive for the crypto market broadly. But the biggest gainers since the XRP decision are the coins that have been most recently designated securities by the SEC. Solana ( SOL-USD ), Polygon, and Cardano ( ADA-USD ) all rallied between 18-20% following the decision. At one point in the hours following the ruling, XRP was up over 90%. If this is the beginning of FOMO buying altcoins, Coinbase is likely in a strong position to benefit. Especially if the Federal Reserve starts pumping the brakes on interest rate hikes and there is a return to some sort of easing policy this year. Risks For Crypto Bulls There is the potential the SEC may take another crack at this. The agency could take this to the court of appeals. However, according to attorney James Murphy on a recent podcast appearance, the SEC has to consider if appealing the Ripple ruling is a wise strategy for the Coinbase case: If they appeal to the 2nd circuit, and the 2nd circuit court of appeals affirms the decision in Ripple, that is a binding precedent in the Coinbase case which is also the southern district of New York. Southern district of New York must follow decisions of the 2nd circuit. Non-legal risks to the bullish market reaction include the possibility that profit takers will limit the potential many of these coins have to run. It's been a tough crypto winter for altcoin holders. We've seen the resurgence of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) dominance over the last year. And some crypto holders may look to cut their losses on the news-related jump. Investor Takeaways The XRP ruling is a major development for the cryptocurrency industry domestically. Crypto builders in the US have been begging for regulatory clarity and they received a big life raft from Judge Torres in this Ripple ruling. It's difficult to guess whether the SEC will appeal the decision or not but my hunch is the agency will do so. But until that happens, crypto winter certainly appears to be turning to crypto spring. I'm not sure I'd chase COIN stock at $105. But if I were short, I'd be very concerned.",NEUTRAL,ICO | XRP,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | ICO | REGULATION | XRP,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4617128-ripple-ruling-coinbase-might-be-biggest-winner?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/14886090.jpeg

14885929,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/07/cryptorank-publishes-2023-crypto-fundraising-report,1689350106,CryptoRank publishes 2023 crypto fundraising report,"After a significant downturn in the crypto market, it appears that in the first half of 2023, the venture investment market, much like the price of Bitcoin, has found its bottom. But unlike the BTC price, the recovery trend in fundraising has not been observed yet; the raised amount fell by 87% in Q2 2023 compared to Q2 2022. A total of $5.1B was raised across 619 funding rounds in the first half of 2023. Improved market sentiment has not had a significant impact on fee growth. Historical data shows that the total fees figure often lags behind the Bitcoin price by several months. Highlights Service, СeFi, and Infrastructure startups received the highest amount of funding. The largest crypto raise was by Stripe, which closed a $6.5B funding round in March Vitalik Buterin, Jack Dorsey, and Sam Altman were prominent investors in the funding rounds. In the first half of the year, Blockchain Service emerged as the dominant category in the fundraising market, capturing a significant 38% of total investments. Interestingly, there has been a notable decline in venture capital’s interest in DeFi, which now accounts for only 9% of the overall funding. Blockchain service projects are leading the way, largely due to the growing adoption of Web3 technologies. They serve as the main connection between users and blockchain, bridging the gap between web2 and web3 and making the experience of using decentralized networks more convenient. Among blockchain service projects raising money in 2023, Ledger, a crypto wallet developer, and EigenLayer, a liquid staking derivatives restocking platform, are noteworthy. VCs continue to prioritize early-stage rounds, with pre-seed and seed rounds accumulating a total of over 1 billion USD in funding. In contrast, in later stages such as Series A, B, C, and D, the number of successfully closed rounds tends to decline. Meanwhile, the average amount raised per round is significantly higher at later stages of fundraising. However, with the expansion of the crypto market and the emergence of high-quality projects, we can anticipate a potential shift towards increased funding in post-seed rounds. Trending Categories in Crypto Fundraising A detailed analysis of the category reveals that the position of DeFi projects in terms of fundraising is not as weak as it may appear. While DeFi projects are not leading in terms of fundraising, they are in second place in terms of the number of funding rounds. In contrast, Blockchain Infrastructure projects have the opposite pattern. These projects are second in terms of fundraising per month, but they have one of the smallest numbers of funding rounds. Infrastructure projects often have the largest funding rounds, but they occur quite rarely. Let's take a look at the most popular categories among the most active investors. The chart below not only displays the most active investors but also allows us to assess the prioritized sectors for each fund. Coinbase Ventures and Circle prioritize investing in DeFi, while Polygon Fund and a16z Crypto prioritize GameFi. Most of the most active investors primarily invest in blockchain service and DeFi projects. However, for some, GameFi is an important area of focus, as they are quick to adopt and allow them to build an entertainment ecosystem, such as Animoca Brands. Notable Funding Rounds of 2023 Currently, most projects are raising small amounts. Nearly half of all rounds with a known raised amount were in the range of $1 million to $5 million. Investors are still hesitant to invest significant amounts in crypto startups, as evidenced by the top 10 largest fundraising rounds of the first half of 2023. The top three projects in terms of fundraising are only partially integrated into web3 and blockchain, relying mostly on web2 technologies. Apart from Stripe, other notable investments in the top funding rounds include a digital exchange eToro, and character.ai, backed by prominent investors such as a16z and Elad Gil. These strategic investments highlight the diverse range of opportunities and the growing interest in innovative platforms and AI-driven technologies within the investment landscape. Among the key figures in the crypto during the first half of the year were notable individuals such as Vitalik Buterin and Jack Dorsey. These influential figures have actively participated in funding rounds, demonstrating their belief in the potential of blockchain and cryptocurrency. Additionally, seasoned venture capitalists like Tim Draper have also joined the fray, making strategic investments in projects like EtherMail. The Bottom Line The first half of 2022 witnessed a weak outcome in raising funds from private investors in cryptocurrency startups. This is evident from the significant drop in raises during Q2, reaching the lowest level of funds raised since the end of 2020. Many investors who were highly active in 2021-2022 have now considerably reduced their investments in Web3. However, can we expect a trend reversal? The answer is unequivocal: yes. With the emergence of new trends, further market recovery, and better regulation standards, many investors will return to the market, and we should also expect an influx of new investors. As the year progresses, it will be fascinating to observe how these developments shape the future of the industry and pave the way for new innovations and collaborations.

42393107,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgG0s5,1689348696,Mutiny’s New Browser-Based Bitcoin Wallet on Lightning Avoids App Store Restrictions,"Mutiny, a Bitcoin wallet startup, released on Thursday a beta version of what it says is the first self-custodial Lightning wallet that runs on the web.  The wallet is browser-based, which avoids restrictions that might be placed on wallets distributed through app stores run by Apple or Google.  Apple has reportedly censored bitcoin-focused products like the decentralized social media app Damus. That app’s developer was forced to remove a bitcoin tipping feature that Apple ultimately considered a prohibited form of payment for digital content. Two of Mutiny’s founders later released a workaround for the Damus feature, known as Zapple Pay, that relies on emojis to trigger tips.  Read more: Jack Dorsey Questions Apple's Tim Cook Over Bitcoin Support as Damus Deplatforming Looms  Mutiny CEO Tony Giorgio says creating a web-based wallet allows for unrestricted innovation and is the key quality that sets the product apart from its competition.  “Our main difference compared to other Lightning wallets like Phoenix and Muun is that our wallet is a progressive web app (PWA),” Giorgio told CoinDesk. “So we can ship and push updates that are not restricted to the limitations of the Apple or Google store platforms.”  One example of that innovation is what Mutiny calls just-in-time channels, which is a feature that alleviates the burden of managing channel liquidity – the ability to send and receive funds on Lightning, Bitcoin’s second layer payment network for cheaper and faster transactions.  Many experts agree that liquidity management is Lightning’s Achilles’ heel. Last month, Bitcoin developer and researcher Burak Keceli told CoinDesk, “Lightning has many problems. But number one to me is the inbound liquidity problem.”  Another notable feature is Mutiny’s social tipping capability via the Nostr Wallet Connect (NWC) protocol. This allows the wallet to easily integrate with Nostr apps like Damus to enable tips, also known as “zaps.” The functionality can be extended beyond tipping to facilitate payment for subscription-based products and services. Nostr is an acronym for “notes and other stuff transmitted by relays.”  Last week’s launch of Zapple Pay by Mutiny Chief Technology Officer Ben Carman and Chief Product Officer Paul Miller relied on a clever way to enable zaps via emojis.  The launch came after Apple threatened to remove Damus from its App Store for allowing users to tip each other on content posted in the app – a prohibited practice the tech giant reportedly considers equivalent to selling digital media.  Read more: Apple May Not Like It, but ‘Zapple Pay’ Finds Workaround for Bitcoin Tipping on Damus  Since Zapple Pay enables zaps via emojis and emojis are allowed on posts, Damus users can still tip on posts, despite Apple’s restrictions.  Miller says Zapple Pay runs on NWC and that it acted as a testing ground for the new wallet’s social tipping feature.  “We have a lot of NWC stuff built-in,” Miller explained. “Ben and I thought Zapple Pay would be a fun way to test it out.”  The company emphasized that Mutiny is still in beta mode, meaning there may still be bugs to fix.  “Some lesser-known bugs exist, but we generally want to exercise caution when using this wallet for now,” the company states on its blog. “Test the wallet, let us know how it is, and I promise we will surprise you with how fast we fix your bugs and ship new features.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | TECHNOLOGY,Frederick Munawa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/07/14/mutinys-new-browser-based-bitcoin-wallet-on-lightning-avoids-app-store-restrictions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dc2b0b05ea47bf0f5d7e60e4e2b1313434d26bd1-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The huge price spike can be attributed to investors jumping on the bandwagon with fear of missing out on XRP after the big news regarding its victory over the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Related Reading: Ripple Eyes Tokenized Assets Sector As It Expects Market Cap To Reach $30 Trillion The court determined on June 13 that the sale of XRP to regular investors does not constitute the sale of an unregistered security. As such, United States District Judge Analisa Torres ruled in partial favor of Ripple, saying that XRP sales on public cryptocurrency exchanges were not offers of securities under the law. However, the judge remarked that Ripple’s direct sale of XRP to institutional investors in the amount of approximately $700 million violated federal legislation regarding the sale of securities. This catapulted XRP’s price from $0.478 to $0.7885 in just under a day. With its current market cap, this means XRP is now the third-largest native cryptocurrency behind Bitcoin and Ethereum when the USDT stablecoin is removed. XRP price still holding gains | Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com 24-Hour Trading Volume Spikes 1700%+ According to data from Coinmarketcap, XRP’s 24-hour trading volume has spiked a whopping 1,758.13% to over $13.49 billion. Trading volumes have surged on various exchanges, where Upbit, the South Korean-based crypto exchange, had over $2.7 billion in 24-hour trading volume. Binance also saw over $2.3 billion in trading volume as investors scurried to buy XRP. Coinglass data shows more than $35 million short position trades on XRP have been liquidated in the past 24 hours. Most of these are from Bybit, OKX, and Binance, with $21 million, $14 million, and $14 million in short position liquidations, respectively. Of course, fast price rises often end in pullbacks as XRP remains a volatile digital asset. But its recent breakout shows it’s still an altcoin to watch, with the potential for even bigger gains if more investors continue to FOMO. However, XRP’s potential for long-term growth continues to be supported by Ripple Labs’ real-world value as a payments network.

42393124,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgG2C9,1689346242,"Transparency for the Whales, Privacy for the Plebs","Depending on your perspective, this week brought a double dose of black pills for those who held out hope of salvaging cryptocurrency users’ privacy – or white pills for those seeking greater transparency for a $1 trillion market.  First, Arkham Intelligence, a on-chain data analytics provider, opened an intel bounty marketplace with the express purpose of unmasking the owners of crypto wallets.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  “Deanonymization is destiny,” the company declared in a ""white paper"" (really a marketing brochure, printed in the same academic-looking font and layout as Satoshi Nakamoto’s original proposal for anonymous digital cash). “Eventually, everyone’s blockchain identity will be linked to their real-world identity.” (Emphasis mine.)  Descriptively and directionally, Arkham may be correct – but its project of accelerating that outcome understandably rubbed privacy advocates the wrong way. The subsequent revelation that Arkham had inadvertently leaked its customers’ personal data offered comic relief.  Blockchains are one kind of fishbowl; regulated exchanges are another. The Arkham kerfuffle was followed by an illuminating report about asset management giant BlackRock’s proposed spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) from CoinDesk’s Ian Allison. He learned of an information-sharing agreement between BlackRock’s partners, the Nasdaq (which plans to list the ETF’s shares) and crypto exchange Coinbase. The arrangement would go further than surveillance-sharing agreements (SSAs) in previous bitcoin ETF applications. Rather than Coinbase just pushing trade data to regulators, to BlackRock and to the Nasdaq, the latter parties would be allowed to pull data from the crypto exchange, “up to and including personally identifiable information (PII), such as the customer’s name and address.”  To be fair, there’s a reason the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) asks ETF applicants to obtain SSAs with regulated markets for the underlying assets, and it’s not some covert ambition to become another NSA. The regulator aims to deter market manipulation.  Arkham’s intel exchange might serve a similarly salubrious purpose. “Transparency about what market players are doing is good for everyday traders and investors and helps to level the playing field,” the company noted in an FAQ. “This kind of widely available market transparency is missing in TradFi, which privileges bigger, well-resourced players at the expense of everyone else.”  Read more: Arkham Intelligence Traces Transactions on the Blockchain  So there’s a conceivable timeline where Arkham’s on-chain intel marketplace promotes transparency for the powerful without (further) eroding privacy for the weak, to borrow a formulation from WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. There’s no alpha in doxxing plebs, after all; degens just want to know what the whales are up to. CoinDesk, it should be noted, has a data and tokens team dedicated analyzing on-chain trends to benefit the trader audience.  All this is well and good, as long as you think of cryptocurrency strictly as a trading asset, and not as, you know, a currency. Indeed, trading – put more bluntly, speculation – has historically been crypto’s main use case.  The danger is that blockchain identity bounties could be weaponized against the weak.  Two years ago, a data breach at a crowdfunding website exposed the identities of donors to a legal defense fund for a defendant who one side of the culture war had already found guilty without a trial. An international newspaper saw fit to amplify the names of several ""public officials"" who donated, including a police sergeant who gave a whole $25 and a fire department paramedic who kicked in all of $10. Not to be outdone, a local television reporter contacted the paramedic’s employer and reported, with a whiff of incredulous disappointment, that the city had not placed this obscure individual, who was not accused of breaking any laws, on administrative leave. (The defendant, for the record, was acquitted by a jury of his peers.)  Unlike crowdfunding websites, decentralized networks can’t be pressured into blocking transfers to politically disfavored recipients. There’s no “CEO of Bitcoin.” But you don’t need to “breach” a cryptocurrency network to see where the money is moving – it’s all out there in the open. Pseudonymous blockchain addresses are the only fig leaf available to participants.  Take those away for everyone, not just the high rollers, and you won’t just give retail traders a leg up; you’ll also arm the internet’s stalkers, sadists and scolds with a new set of ""receipts.""

Thursday, July 13, saw one of the most important lawsuits in the history of the industry come to an end, and the ruling in favor of Ripple triggered a massive rally. As digital assets across the space recorded double-digit gains, liquidation volumes climbed quickly, now clocking over $300 million. Crypto Short Traders Take Big Losses The high volumes of crypto liquidations in the market so far have been a result of price recovery. As such, the vast majority of traders who have been losing money have been short traders, that is, traders who were betting on prices falling rather than recovering. Related Reading: Polygon Upgrade Proposal Pushes Price Over 5%, Is It Too Late To Buy? According to data from Coinglass, out of the over $300 million in liquidations, short traders made up for a total of $219 million. On the flip side, the volume from long traders was much lower, coming in at only $82.74 million for the same 24-hour period. This means that short traders made up 70.33% of all liquidations during this time, as long traders made the most money. Furthermore, over 86,000 traders saw their positions liquidated on the last day, but the single largest liquidation happened on the Bitmex exchange. This position was worth $2.82 million at the time of liquidation, taking place across the XRPUSD pair on the exchange. Liquidations cross $300 million in 24 hours | Source: Coinglass As expected, Bitcoin led the liquidation volumes during this time, but interestingly, Ethereum was not the second-highest volume as it usually is. That title was claimed by XRP traders this time around with a total of $62.17 million liquidated in 24 hours. Will The Liquidations Continue? A major factor behind the liquidations was the wild price fluctuations that were triggered by the Ripple victory. Since the court declared that XRP was not a security, the price of the digital asset rallied over 60%, taking the rest of the crypto market with it. However, as the market has broken into a new trading day, prices are starting to stabilize and liquidations are beginning to settle out. If the market continues like this, then there would not be high liquidation volumes going forward. Unless something triggers a rally or a crash, which would lead to more liquidations.

While Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, kept its cool around the $30,000 mark, the world of crypto exchanges was buzzing like a beehive. Big four exchanges still dominate The Q2 2023 Crypto Exchange Report from TokenInsight gives a peek into this hive. The top 10 exchanges saw a trading volume of $8.3 trillion in Q2, which is a 23% slide down the hill from the previous quarter. Despite this downhill ride, the big four - Binance, OKX, Bybit, and Bitget - held their ground, accounting for a hefty 85% of the total market. Even with a 3% dip in market share, Binance still holds sway with over 50% of the total trading volume. Binance still commands the market The report also highlighted shifts in market share. Binance saw a slight decrease in its dominance, but it still held a commanding lead with over half the market share. Meanwhile, exchanges like OKX, Bybit, Bitget, MEXC, and Huobi saw their market shares rise. On the flip side, Upbit and Coinbase saw a slight dip. Spot trading In the area of spot trading, the top 10 exchanges had a volume of $1.3 trillion in Q2, which resulted in a 45% decrease from Q1. Binance continued its dominance of the spot market, with a 55.33% market share. Bitget and Bybit made significant strides, increasing their market shares, while Upbit took a hit due to regulatory changes in South Korea. Derivatives The derivatives market held up a bit better, with a 14.6% decrease from Q1 and a 50.7% decrease from Q2 2022. Binance kept hold of a large part of the derivatives niche with a 54% market share, followed by OKX with 18%. Exchange tokens Lastly, the report gave some insights into the performance of exchange tokens. Bitget's $BGB led the way with a 22.6% price increase in Q2. Bitfinex's $LEO wasn't far behind, with a 15.4% increase. $OKB of OKX also had a good run, with a 7.1% increase. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

""This outcome should moderately de-risk the regulatory pressure on the stock,” analysts John Todaro and Daniel Lehmann wrote, which is a significant overhang on the share price.  The broker maintained its buy rating on Coinbase shares and raised its price target to $120 from $70. Coinbase shares were trading 1% lower at $105.96 in premarket trading Friday. The stock closed 25% higher on Thursday following the Ripple court ruling.  Recent bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded-fund (ETF) applications from major traditional finance institutions that are using Coinbase for various services “gives us further comfort regarding broad support for the ecosystem and Coinbase,” the report said.  Needham said it had modestly raised its second-quarter 2023 earnings estimates for the crypto exchange, but cautioned that a further decline in retail trading would result in poor volumes for the quarter.  Needham’s bullish comments were in stark contrast to those of German investment bank Berenberg, which wrote Thursday that the rally in Coinbase shares following news of the court’s decision was unwarranted.

Related Reading: MATIC Price Prediction: Polygon Bulls Aim For $0.80 The asset’s surge, which saw MATIC price climbing from a low of $0.67 last Friday to a high of $0.88 yesterday before retracting to $0.84 at the time of writing, marks a nearly 30% increase in the past 7 days. The surge also signals MATIC’s resilience, given that it comes just a month after the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) classified it as a security, triggering a drastic dip in its value. This move by the SEC made MATIC dwell in a bloodbath for a week to trade below the $0.6 mark. MATIC Road To Recovery MATIC’s recovery, however, has been somewhat fascinating. Over the past 24 hours, MATIC has rallied by nearly 10%, exhibiting a strong upward trajectory. Interestingly, this rally mirrors the movements of several notable altcoins in the market, indicating a wider market recovery trend. Despite the initial setback following the SEC’s classification, MATIC has demonstrated a comeback. Its rebound not only highlights the resilience of the asset but also underscores its growing popularity among investors, which can be attributed to the increasing interest in the Polygon platform, known for its scalability solutions for Ethereum transactions. MATIC has witnessed a dramatic rise in its market capitalization over the past week, marking a nearly $2 billion increase. The digital asset, starting from a valuation of $6.2 billion last Friday, has seen its market cap surge to $7.89 billion as of today. Interestingly, it’s not just MATIC’s price and market cap that has experienced a notable upswing. Within the same week, the daily trading volume for Polygon has nearly doubled from its figures last Friday. This surge is evident in the jump from a trading volume of $357 million late last week to as high as $952 million in the past 24 hours.

42393105,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgG0hp,1689339600,"Hip-Hop Collab Teams PUMA, Roc Nation and Legitimate for Sneaker Release","Non-fungible token (NFT) company Legitimate is teaming up with shoe behemoth PUMA and entertainment agency Roc Nation to release a sneaker collection.  Called “Evolution of the Mixtape,” the collection pays homage to the 50th anniversary of hip-hop and allows buyers to access exclusive music content curated by Roc Nation.  The three sneaker models, called “Cassette Tape,” “Playlist” and “Disc” are embedded with an “LGT Tag,” Legitimate’s near-field communication (NFC) chip in the tongue of the shoe. Owners can scan the NFC chip to access to a digital portal which will feature weekly mixtapes, behind-the-scenes artist content and unreleased tracks from Roc Nation artists.  Calvin Chan, founder and CEO of Legitimate told CoinDesk that partnering with PUMA and Roc Nation not only tells the stories of a cultural movement, but helps expand fans’ access to their favorite artists’ music.  “The vision here was to pay homage to and innovate on the concept of a mixtape bringing talent and people together, but also exploring how mixtape and hip hop culture has evolved and grown over time, especially with the inclusion of tech,” said Chan. “PUMA, Roc Nation and Legitimate are working together to innovate on this concept of the mixtape itself by seamlessly connecting the dots between fashion, music and technology.”  Additionally, he added that utilizing an NFC chip and rewarding buyers for their purchase with new music not only helps keep them engaged, but builds brand loyalty.  “‘Phygital’ products allow brands to engage with their customers on a physical and digital level,” said Chan. “This capability and visibility is very important for brands, and ultimately, extremely valuable for consumers as they derive more value from their purchases and brand loyalty.”  While digitally-native fashion has helped define a vision for the metaverse, physically-linked items can help facilitate the jump from Web2 to Web3. Last week, men’s luxury brand Dior released NFC-chip embedded sneakers that utilize the blockchain to prove ownership. In March, Web3 streetwear brand Cult and Rain released its second digital wearable collection featuring physical hoodies with NFC chips for garment provenance.

Ethereum TPS To Scale Up In a groundbreaking development for the Ethereum blockchain, the scaling barrier has been shattered, according to an announcement by Uri Kolodny, co-founder and CEO of StarkWare. Kolodny expressed his excitement, stating that the implementation of the new upgrade has finally made high transactions per second (TPS) a reality on the Ethereum mainnet. Starknet, which is a Layer-2 blockchain or “rollup” to the Ethereum blockchain, was created by the Starkware team to allow Ethereum to scale securely. Originally aiming for a potential TPS of hundreds within Q3, the StarkWare team was pleasantly surprised by the results of the stress test. Quantum Leap Exceeds Expectations Kolodny revealed that they had expected a few dozen TPS at this early stage, but the actual figure far surpassed their expectations, reaching a consistent 37 TPS. Moreover, during peak moments, the transfer transactions per second approached the impressive figure of 100. Kolodny said, “We said this upgrade would deliver potential TPS of hundreds within Q3, and only hoped from the stress test to check we’re on target. A few dozen TPS at this early point would have left us excited – but we got more than we bargained for.” Last Week’s Testnet Run Big Success The team had previously deployed the Quantum Leap on the Goerli testnet on July 5, followed by a community vote in which 97.91% of voters agreed to push forward to the mainnet as it demonstrated speeds higher than the team’s expectations. Anticipating a ""time to inclusion"" of approximately 15 seconds, the team was amazed to discover that the vast majority of transactions were confirmed in under 10 seconds. This achievement meant that decentralized applications (dApps) could validate on-chain transactions within seconds, significantly enhancing the speed and efficiency of the Ethereum network. Short-Term And Long-Term Benefits Eli Ben-Sasson, co-founder and president of StarkWare, described the impact of this breakthrough as granting the community a ""supercharged power tool."" This newfound capability empowers developers to create projects that were previously unattainable, opening doors to innovative and transformative applications. He also highlighted the more immediate and long-term benefits of this achievement, stating that in the short term, DeFi will benefit from increased speed and smoother user experiences. On-chain gaming will become more seamless, enhancing the overall gameplay and user engagement. Looking ahead, the long-term effects of this development are expected to reshape how we interact with technology and each other, giving rise to new and creative projects. The achievement of smashing the scaling ceiling represents a significant milestone for the Ethereum blockchain, signaling its readiness to handle increased transaction volumes and support a wide range of decentralized applications. As the network evolves, the potential for further innovation and growth becomes even more promising. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

42393123,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgG271,1689337974,First Mover Americas: XRP Gains 66% on Ripple’s Partial Court Victory,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Ripple Labs scored a partial victory in its fight with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in a court ruling that brought a modicum of regulatory clarity for the cryptocurrency industry. The sale of Ripple’s XRP tokens on exchanges and through algorithms did not constitute investment contracts, a judge in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York ruled Thursday. However, the institutional sale of the tokens did violate federal securities laws, the judge ruled. XRP soared as much as 80% on the news with crypto exchanges Coinbase and Gemini among those saying they might list or re-list the token. Early reads from legal experts, though, suggest the ruling falls short of settling the question of whether and under what circumstances a digital asset meets the definition of a security under U.S. law.  Ripple’s XRP has surpassed Binance’s BNB token to become the world's four-largest digital asset by market cap after its 66% post-court ruling advance brought its valuation to $41.44 billion, according to CoinDesk data. BNB – which rallied 6.5% in wake of the court ruling – now has a market cap of $40.57 billion. Ripple bulls however, shouldn’t forget the second part of yesterday’s court decision. “The Court has found Ripple to be in violation of securities laws, specifically in relation to direct sales to institutional investors,” wrote CoinShares’ Head of Product Townsend Lansing in an email to CoinDesk. “As such, XRP is not only deemed a security, but questions have arisen regarding the legality of its offering,” he continued. “In regards to these sales, the Court has confirmed that the law was indeed violated, marking a considerable victory for the SEC and setting a precedent for its legal actions against other cryptocurrencies.""  Alex Mashinsky, co-founder and former CEO of insolvent crypto lender Celsius, was arrested in New York on Thursday following an investigation into the company's collapse, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) confirmed to CoinDesk. Mashinsky and others are charged with seven criminal counts including securities fraud, commodities fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy to manipulate the price of Celsius' token CEL, according to the unsealed DOJ indictment. The criminal charges were accompanied by three separate lawsuits against Mashinsky and Celsius by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and Federal Trade Commission (FTC).  Chart of the Day  On Thursday, the discount in shares in the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) traded 37.52% lower than the net asset value. That's the narrowest discount since Nov. 15, 2022.  The discount narrowed sharply as Thursday's XRP court ruling undermined the SEC's crypto regulation push and revived investor interest in alternative cryptocurrencies.  - Omkar Godbole  Trending Posts  Bitcoin's Crypto Market Dominance Slides by Most in 13 Months as XRP Court Ruling Spurs 'Alt Season' Talk  XRP Short Traders Log Highest Losses in 2023 After Landmark Court Ruling  Alex Mashinsky's Bail Set at $40M, Travel Restricted",NEUTRAL,XRP | BNB,EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | XRP | BNB,"Lyllah Ledesma, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/14/first-mover-americas-xrp-gains-66-on-ripples-partial-court-victory,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/15ca690dea8f866f3f8994f8452c0ff62914e41a-1509x784.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42393104,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgG0ch,1689337800,How the Celsius Affair Plays Into the U.S. Crypto Regulatory Debate,"The dramatic arrest of Celsius founder Alex Mashinsky on Thursday adds extra fuel to an already fiery debate over how to treat crypto – and whether 100-year–old laws are sufficient to regulate the likes of Binance and Coinbase.  The action by multiple federal regulators comes as the Securities and Exchange Commission’s alleged authority over crypto comes under judicial pressure, and lawmakers and regulators fight over what new legislation, if any, is needed for the sector.  Mashinsky, who was Celsius’ Chief Executive Officer until September after it filed for bankruptcy one year ago today, has pleaded not guilty to charges including wire fraud and securities fraud, and to manipulating the price of Celsius’ token CEL; his lawyers have told CoinDesk he “vehemently denies” the allegations.  The news came on the same day that a New York court ruled partially in favor of Ripple, saying that the XRP token wasn’t an investment contract when sold algorithmically on exchanges, and hence doesn’t fall under securities law.  That in turn could have implications for a suite of cases which the SEC has taken against Coinbase (COIN), Binance and Bittrex, arguing that they should have registered because tokens traded on those platforms, such as solana (SOL), polygon (MATIC) and cardano (ADA), fall under its purview.  It also comes in the week that lawmakers in Congress sought to again rejig laws to fit digital assets, with a bipartisan bill from Senators Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) focused on giving extra crypto powers to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).  CEL v. XRP  Mashinsky has previously sought to distinguish its own case from that of Ripple, saying that CEL was registered with the SEC. In reality, he appears to have sought an exemption from registration by arguing the token was only used by accredited, financially knowledgeable investors.  That’s not the only difference between the cases. Ripple is formally separate from XRP, but Mashinsky may not have been so careful about links to his own token. According to the SEC filing, “Mashinsky wrote in an internal message that he wanted ‘to be able to talk about CEL just like public companies talk about their stock.’” It alleges that, after Celsius, Mashinsky was the second largest holder of CEL.  The SEC appears to concede a distinction between Celsius and other cases. It says Celsius offered and sold CEL as a security, but doesn’t explicitly say whether the token was correctly registered or exempted. Celsius is taken to task for failing to register another of its offerings, the Earn Interest Program – under which the company offered rates as high as 17% to investors tendering their crypto, which the SEC also says is a security.  CoinDesk has reached out to the SEC for comment on the status of CEL, but did not immediately receive a response.  New laws?  The SEC has stressed that existing rules designed to protect investors, many of which date back to the 1930s, already apply to crypto companies like Celsius.  “The misconduct here is yet another example of the need for crypto market participants to come into compliance with our securities laws,” which would have implied proper disclosures and routine inspections by regulators, the agency’s Enforcement Director Gurbir Grewal told reporters on Thursday.  That’s an unsurprising stance for the SEC to take: its ongoing legal cases hinge on it asserting that current laws are clear and that Binance, Bittrex, Coinbase and Ripple aren’t complying.  Rival officials put a different emphasis.  The CFTC believes large-scale cryptocurrencies like bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), USDC and tether are commodities under U.S. law, and has said both Mashinksy and Celsius should have been registered in connection with commodity pool operations. But CFTC officials are less satisfied with the legal status quo, and say the Celsius affair just underlines the need for change.  “I am glad that the Commission [CFTC] has the ability to go after fraud after the fact,” CFTC Commissioner Kristin N. Johnson said in a Thursday statement, but added that “the lack of a clear regulatory framework for digital assets allowed this fraud to flourish.”  “Customers and the public would be better served by a comprehensive regulatory regime that could prevent frauds like this one from developing in the first place,” said Johnson reiterating her call for a “a clear and robust regulatory regime for digital assets …. in light of yet another example of its necessity.”  Read more: Alex Mashinsky Built Celsius Into a House of Cards",NEUTRAL,ADA,ADA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | BNB,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/07/14/how-the-celsius-affair-plays-into-the-us-crypto-regulatory-debate,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/037612ae8d6779cb5d9f8ef4229ac8f9024eb876-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

14880169,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=542671,1689336023,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shows Strength With 5% Rally, Reversal Confirmed?","The Shiba Inu price has risen over 5% in the last 24 hours amid the market-wide hype surrounding Ripple’s partial victory in its legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). But SHIB investors should still be cautious: While the SHIB price shows a clear uptrend of 23% over the last 30 days, a complete confirmation of a trend reversal is still pending. Shiba Inu Price Analysis Technically, the Shiba Inu price remains in bearish territory for several reasons. As explained in previous analyses, the Shib price entered a downtrend channel in early February this year. The breakout from the bearish chart pattern succeeded six days ago, however, there is still a possibility that it is a fakeout. Shib’s trading volume was rather below average during and after the breakout. Only yesterday there was a noticeable increase. Within the last few hours, trading volume rose to $232 million, 200% higher than the previous day. In the best case, the volume should remain high to avoid a fakeout. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Whale Holding 10% Of Total SHIB Supply Shocks The Market More of a bearish argument is that yesterday’s SHIB rally stopped at $0.00000813. Thus, the price could not break above resistance at $0.00000816, nor could it set a new local high on the 4-hour chart. A look at the 1-day chart also shows that the SHIB price continues to trade below the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.00000832. The following days could become crucial to confirm a sustainable trend change or a fakeout. The battle between bulls and bears is still in full swing. The bull side would ideally like to break out above the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level with a high trading volume. This could be a first confirmation for a sustainable trend change. Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Breakout Alert: Potential 30% Rally Looming In this case, the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.00000977 could come into focus. Close to it is also the long-term “bull boundary line”, the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $0.00000961. If SHIB also exceeds this level, one can finally speak of a trend reversal. Before that, however, the current gains stand on shaky legs. Shibarium As Catalyst As NewsBTC reported, Shiba Inu chief developer Shytoshi Kusama has hinted a few days ago that the long-awaited layer-2 solution Shibarium will be unveiled along with numerous other innovations at the ETHToronto conference on August 15-16. With only 32 days left until this event, the hype could undoubtedly serve as a catalyst for SHIB. At least Shiba Inu ecosystem token BONE has already benefited from the announcement, raking in high double-digit percentage gains. Just today, Kusama fueled anticipation for Shibarium when he announced the relaunch of the official Shiba Inu website Shib.io. Via Twitter, Kusama teased “Enjoying the summer of Shibarium.” As the #summerofshibarium continues we are proud to introduce new branding for https://t.co/vRofmNPr53 and other #SHIBARMY websites!

FTX owes as much as $8 billion to customers after it collapsed it November in an event that caused a widespread crypto market downturn. Celsius owes its users around $4.7 billion, according to its bankruptcy filing.  Resolving bankruptcy claims can take time. Cayman Island-based trading firm Folkvang told CoinDesk in February that it expects its FTX claim, which wiped out half of its trading equity, to take as long as eight years to be resolved. Users can skip the wait by cashing in their claim on OPNX. Claims are currently selling for around $0.30 per dollar on OPNX rival Claims Market.

When users sell their claim, they will receive the platform's native tokens, reborn OX (reOX) or oUSD, which is the platform's profit-and-loss currency.

42393117,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgG1X7,1689336000,Auction House of Gucci: Christie’s Teams Up With Luxury Brand on NFT Collection,"256-year old auction house Christie’s is teaming up with luxury fashion brand Gucci to release a digital art non-fungible token (NFT) collection.  Titled “Future Frequencies: Explorations in Generative Art and Fashion,” the collection features 21 NFTs created by artificial intelligence (AI) artist Claire Silver, generative artist Emily Xie, decentralized autonomous artist Botto and more. The auction, which will take place on the auction house’s digital art platform Christie’s 3.0, opens for bidding on July 18 and closes July 25.  The NFT collection draws inspiration from Gucci textiles, color palettes and its Bamboo 1947 collection – an iconic series of handbags with the brand’s signature bamboo handle. Employing generative systems including algorithms and AI, the collection aims to help expand creativity through the intersection of art, fashion and technology.  Sebastian Sanchez, Manager of Digital Art Sales at Christie’s, told CoinDesk that the collaboration inspires both artists and the fashion industry to tap into Web3 technologies.  “My goal with this auction is to show the intersection – it’s a spectrum right now,” said Sanchez. “There are so many generative artists who are working with studies on textiles, garments, patterns, and then you have people actually doing literal 3D garments and what we're presenting is everywhere in between those ranges.”  Sanchez added that partnering with Gucci makes the collection especially poignant, and invites both art collectors and fashion lovers to explore the interwoven themes of the art.  “The Gucci name has such a power, and they have their own audience and a proven record that their audience is probably very different from ours,” said Sanchez. “That to me is kind of where the beauty in our collaboration lies – Christie's is an art expert and Gucci is a fashion expert, and we're kind of like right in the middle.”  Claire Silver, pseudonymous NFT artist who recently kicked off her solo-show at marketplace SuperRare’s NYC gallery spoke about the two works she created for the collection.  “Combining AI, 3D, film, and advanced mathematical functions with antique paintings and tapestries from China, Japan and Eastern and Western Europe, both works are intended to celebrate the era of AI: the sophistication of experience, the innocent joy of the new, the depth of cultural heritage, and the light of the future,” said Silver.  While Christie’s has been deep in the Web3 space since its record-breaking $69 million sale of artist Beeple’s “EVERYDAYS” NFT in March 2021, Gucci has been slowly growing its presence in its digital fashion and art endeavors. In February 2022, the brand purchased land in metaverse The Sandbox to create the Gucci Vault, its digital experience venue. In June 2022, it invested $25,000 in SuperRare’s native RARE token to join the marketplace’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) and launch its “Vault Art Space” to showcase NFT art.

Multi-City Tour Rakes In Sign-Ups Digital identity verification provider, Worldcoin, has achieved a significant milestone in its mission to provide a global identity protocol. The project recently surpassed 2 million sign-ups for its World ID during the beta phase, accomplishing this feat in less than half the time it took to reach the first million. The company announced the news via a blog on July 13 that it received a record number of signups from different parts of the world like Barcelona, Berlin, Buenos Aires, New York, Seoul, and Tokyo, which it credited to its multi-city tour. Furthermore, the statement also revealed that an impressive average of over 40,000 people joined the World ID system weekly, demonstrating the widespread interest and support for this privacy-preserving digital identity solution. World ID Thanks Supporters The Worldcoin community has expressed its gratitude to the builders, integration and composability partners, and the individuals who continuously verify their World IDs. They wrote, “Thank you to everyone who made this milestone possible, from the builders to the integration and composability partners to the individuals verifying their World ID every day. Achieving 2 million World ID sign-ups is more than just an accomplishment for the Worldcoin community; it’s also a significant milestone in the broader global effort to make digitally-verifiable identity more accessible to everyone.” Growing Demand For World ID For billions of people without the means of digitally verifiable identification, the World IDs promise a globally recognized digital identification system wherein users can store their identity information on their mobile devices, safely secured by employing zk-proofs. To enroll in the World ID program and obtain a digital identification document, individuals are required to visit a specialized device called an Orb, through which they can scan one of their irises. This process generates a distinct cryptographic representation referred to as an ""IrisHash,"" which serves to authenticate the individual's uniqueness. Notably, participants who successfully upload their sensitive biometric data are compensated for their participation in the form of a proprietary digital currency known as Worldcoin. To meet the growing demand for verified World IDs, Worldcoin plans to significantly increase the availability of Orbs in the coming months. More information regarding the timing and locations of new Orbs will be shared in due course, ensuring a wider reach for this innovative technology.

42393120,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgG1rd,1689334200,The Death of a Discord Server,"On April 17, ClubNFT officially shut its Discord server down. “We have decided to consolidate all our discussions onto just Twitter and Instagram,” wrote community manager Ana Marie Alanes to @everyone. It was the first server death I’d personally witnessed but I’m guessing it won’t be the last, given how recent developments in reputation and identity tokens could streamline the process of Web3 community building.  I never quite clicked with Discord. I finally dragged mine off my phone a few weeks ago and I haven’t felt out of the loop yet, so I think it’s safe to say that in Web3, Discord’s trajectory is nudging doom-ward.  James McGirk is a senior content lead at Spectral AI. He doesn’t check his Discord messages anymore.  According to James Oldham, co-founder of Web3 wallet Vero, the reason why Discord became the de facto gathering place for crypto communities was that “it offered a simple way to gate users behind different roles, offering different experiences in the same server.”  This is especially true in decentralized finance (DeFi), perhaps the most developed subsector of the blockchain industry with its defined cast of rockstar devs, deep-pocketed whales, and legion of finance punks.  There were more aesthetic reasons too. DeFi likes to thumb its nose at stodgy traditional finance (TradFi), which is why you see so many unicorns and cartoon foodstuffs in logos.  Discord, which was originally designed for Twitch streamers to keep up with their followers was about as far away from Cisco and Mircosoft Teams and Slack as you possibly could find and still maintain enough functionality. In other words, Discord was gamified, and gaming has always been enmeshed with crypto. Several prominent community managers are rumored to have led entire armadas in “Eve Online,” a notoriously difficult Swedish space-themed MMPORG, not to mention Sam Bankman-Fried’s notorious fondness for playing “League of Legends” during Zoom calls (nota bene: an early warning sign – he apparently only ranked bronze level).  Perhaps it’s appropriate that an item class in massive online fantasy game “Everquest” might end up triggering the death of all this. The new asset class Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin pitched, soulbound tokens (SBTs), were inspired by Everquest’s Soulbound items that were bound to a single user and couldn’t be traded or passed between users. Buterin and a group of other high-powered programmers created soulbound tokens which were bound to a single wallet address.  This in turn inspired attestations, which are a more effervescent idea of the SBT, in that they can expire, and other forms of non-fungible tokens (NFT) that could be burned or time-locked while being bound to the users. The beauty of this token class is that it allows users to build an identity that is portable across different decentralized apps (dapps), yet isn’t under the control of a creepy centralized mega-silo like Apple or Google, or a big three credit report bureau.  See also: Leaders in Decentralized Identity Slam Soulbound Tokens  Think of SBTs as reputation primitives. The company I work for, Spectral AI, created a financial reputation primitive in the form of an NFT containing a creditworthiness assessment called the MACRO Score. It measures the likelihood that a wallet will liquidate on a DeFi loan within the next 60 days. They can be used for determining interest rates in DeFi lending pools or, eventually, as composable elements of a group credit score, allowing decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) to arrange financing or compose financial instruments with streams of income or loans.  The beauty of decentralizing identity is similar to that of decentralizing finance generally, wresting control of our identity away from the government or information brokers is that it gives us the opportunity to own our identities and to be selective about what information we give and when.  The holy grail for financial reputation primitives is to create a protocol sound and transparent enough to offer peer-to-peer undercollateralized lending products like mortgages, short-term merchant credit, or credit cards. If you’ve ever tried getting a mortgage in a foreign country, you can appreciate how valuable something like this could be. If not, believe me, it’s a goddamned nightmare.  As things are in real life, finance is only a small part of your online, decentralized, composable identity. The stated holy grail for SBTs is something much larger, a useful tool in Web3’s aim to create a decentralized society, a post-scarcity paradise of good government and easy transactions.  Decentralized alternatives to Discord exist certainly exist, but as with all things online and interconnected, community building is secretly a way of taking advantage of network effects, and Discord is the most connected even if it isn’t designed for that purpose, meaning most users can join the community with the least amount of friction. Software, even crypto, lives or dies by building a community of active users.  You can divide the different internet eras by looking at their preferred startup marketing strategies. Building a successful tech marketing campaign once meant hiring expensive public relations firms and negotiating high-stakes licensing agreements, and, of course, it still can mean that. But as “servers” came unshackled through P2P networks and available on-call by the Cloud drifting up above Silicon Valley, a new form of marketing took hold.  Perhaps inspired by the open-source communities which helped create their software, Web 2.0 startups would often use online community-building to capture and sell to audiences of enthusiastic supporters. Within these communities were the same rigid hierarchies and mini fiefdoms, enshrined by community standards that held the disparate communities of open-source contributors together.  Twitter turned out to be an ideal format for pumping and dumping, and finding new converts, while Reddit and other template-based forums helped corral and contain the faithful. When Web3 rolled around, they followed the same pattern. Ethereum was first introduced and discussed in BitcoinTalk, an early discussion board created by early Bitcoin developer Martti Malmi.  MakerDAO, the decentralized issuer of the dai (DAI) stablecoin, was an early successful example of a forum-rooted community. The idea was first bandied about on Reddit by Rune Christensen, and later they created a forum to hold monthly community calls and post bounty programs. Chainlink also made good use of the so-called LINK Marines, although in recent years Chainlink has affected a more buttoned-down aesthetic. Gone are the once-ubiquitous LINK cubes that infested crypto meme culture and there are fewer devotional memes of founder Sergey Nazarov, replaced with far more whitepapers and well-scrubbed announcements of partnerships and hackathon sponsorships.  NFT communities were quick to follow the same model as altcoins, but they kicked it into overdrive. In the heady days of the last bull market, you could use NFTs to gate access to channels and anoint Discord users with special colored statuses to lord over their peers.  It was all pretty intoxicating at first, but once you belong to a couple of dozen Discord channels and they’re all chiming and chirping at you, you start to notice that not all of the “community building” you can see is human or motivated by wanting to get on a valuable whitelist more than communing with the community.  Admittedly that’s a cynical take, and I think there’s another reason why Discord may be losing steam – older folks like yours truly are joining communities and having trouble with Discord. I saw it first-hand last year when I ran a Discord server for Lonely ROCKS, which was an attempt at creating a decentralized self-portrait gallery. On the advice of our blockchain partner, we used Discord as a rallying point, which included a number of older digital artists and curators.  Discord is probably very intuitive if you grew up using online computer games and understand the ludic logic behind things like breaking a community up into a few dozen channels or typing backslash to summon a friendly verification bot – but to the rest of us, it was agony. Why are people leaving flaming emojis when I type? What does the pink pulsing heart suggest? Should I call HR?  One august curator who shall remain nameless, who retired from running a national museum in his 70s simply couldn’t hack Discord. We held several hand-holding sessions, but one day he blurted out that it all seemed like one great big wretched waste of time and I couldn’t disagree with him.  See also: Blockades and Blockchains: What the Reddit Boycott Has to Do With AI | Opinion  Younger users may also be eschewing monolithic online identities in favor of a more discombobulated existence. Although to be fair to Discord, they allow a great deal of flexibility with how you present yourself on different servers. Think of it as the shift from building your brand to Fake-Insta (Finsta).  I have no doubt that Discord is a superb forum for discussions about anime and Tears of the Kingdom, but for those of us in DeFi who weren’t whelped on digital discussions, maybe the LINK marines have it right and it’s time to don our sportcoats and swaddle ourselves in the 21st-century equivalent of IBM blue; and for DeFi, in general, to think about user experience in every aspect of community building.  Decentralizing identity and seizing the means of conveying identity is a necessary step, but so should creating a user-friendly, seamless onboarding experience for all users – even the damn boomers.",NEUTRAL,LINK,ALTCOIN | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | LINK | TECHNOLOGY,James McGirk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/07/14/the-death-of-a-discord-server,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/411729a28cd27d38ac12b5a203c841e991d16eea-3876x2579.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Stage 1 is now set to imminently sell out, with under 23% of tokens left before the price increases by 10%. The rise is driven by the unique premise of the platform, which offers completely decentralized betting, allowing users to ‘become the house’ and create their own odds. As well as the presence of the two founders, Adam and Paul Kelbie, who are fast becoming favorites in the blockchain community. Adam Kelbie, CEO of Chancer, said “I am delighted with the engagement we’re seeing in the ever-growing Chancer community, as well as the raise - but not completely surprised to be honest! This idea has been years in the making, and this is the year we deliver something huge. We’re not only seeing increased investor interest by the day, but a number of potential partner collaborations.” Users interested in purchasing Chancer tokens can do so through the official website. Chancer: Driving the decentralized betting revolution Chancer is the world’s first decentralized and fully democratized blockchain betting platform. It puts the power firmly back into the hands of bettors, who are usually victims of unfavorable odds set by a house or bookmaker. These odds are stacked against bettors from the get-go. Additionally, these bookies often allow people to only bet on sports or mainstream events. That’s where Chancer is different. As a decentralized platform, users place bets among themselves, allowing for a fully peer-to-peer betting experience. Users can wager small bets among friends, or participate in viral bets regarding global events such as the World Cup Final, the Oscars, or even the US presidential elections. Powered by Google’s WebRTC, users can take up these bets and communicate with others in real-time whilst live streaming events as they unfold. All bets are made and paid out in CHANCER tokens, which gives the coin real utility as it is the lifeblood of the entire platform. As more and more users flock to Chancer, the greater the opportunity to disrupt the betting industry, which was worth more than $63 billion in 2022 and is set to skyrocket to over $150 billion by 2030, CHANCER’s price could also benefit from increased adoption and a spreading global reach. Chancer is also CertiK audited, which only goes to reinforce the faith in the project, given that the team has been fully KYC’d and given the stamp of authenticity many will expect from a development roadmap with such substantial scope. Unveiling the Remarkable Success of Chancer's Raise With real use cases and a platform that works in favor of those using it, it’s easy to see why Chancer has managed to raise $750,000 in such a short period of time. Chancer has an extensive roadmap, detailing its plans from its presale right until it plans on becoming a DAO. Given this exciting trajectory and initial low price, it’s no wonder people are investing now to get in on the ground floor with Chancer. Not only that, but as of the 12th of July the developers added USDT and ETH purchase options, opening up the presale to millions more potential investors. Additionally, there are several perks for CHANCER token holders. Users can stake their tokens and potentially earn passive income in the form of tokens, and even receive discounted fees on bets. All of this, as well as the fact that users can set their own odds, makes it an innovative concept for betting and crypto enthusiasts. To further whet appetites and draw in an even bigger crowd, Chancer is currently holding a massive $100,000 giveaway in tokens. Ten lucky winners will be in with a chance to win a chunk of this money, which is Chancer’s way of giving back to the community. It doesn’t matter how many coins a user has — so long as he has some CHANCER in his wallet, he's in it to win it. Upcoming Developments and Expectations for Chancer Chancer is still in its presale, presenting a potentially interesting prospect to those exploring new projects in 2023. Chancer's current fundraising objective stands at $15 million. Considering the swift achievement of the initial $750,000, the company anticipates a smooth journey toward reaching its target. Following this, Chancer will launch on several exchanges, which will be announced during the course of the presale. Chancer presents a radical, completely unprecedented betting platform that empowers bettors and lets people decide on their own odds. With this in mind, Chancer has a real opportunity to overthrow some of the traditional and archaic betting houses in the market. Don’t miss out on this token opportunity, still currently at the low entry price of $0.01. About Chancer Chancer is set to develop the world’s first decentralized social predictive markets platform. This will allow Chancer token holders to create, and participate in their very own predictive markets based on their interests, expertise and social opportunities. The project intends to disrupt the global gambling and betting market by ‘removing the house’ and taking a slice of the market share as it garners attention by challenging the traditional bookmaking and betting business model. Users can get involved with Chancer on the official website.

This rise was triggered by news that Ripple, the company behind XRP, had won its long-running case against the US Securities and Exchange Commission SEC. The SEC’s case that XRP is a security was the focus of the court trial. To the delight of the crypto community, Judge Annalisa Torres of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York ruled in Ripple’s favor, declaring the XRP token not to be a security. Stellar Looks To Enter The Top 20 Crypto Ranking The altcoin market had been dominated by bearish pressure in recent weeks due partly to the SEC’s declaration of tokens tied to Solana, Polygon, and Cardano as securities. This declaration formed the foundation of the regulator’s case against prominent crypto exchanges Coinbase and Binance. Related Reading: Optimism (OP) Rides The Wave Of Today’s Crypto Surge With 15% Rally That said, the market was jolted back to life yesterday following the announcement of Ripple’s court victory, with most tokens basking in green. Stellar also reacted swiftly to positive market sentiment, going on an almost 90% price rally within a few hours. The token’s price has since steadied, with Stellar currently trading with a 52.4 % gain. With this, XLM’s price rise places it amongst the top daily gainers in the cryptocurrency market today. As of this writing, XLM is valued at $0.147189, with a 3.9% price decrease in the past hour. The token has a 24-hour trading volume of over $1.26 billion, representing a 3,386% surge in the past day. According to CoinGecko data, the Stellar token is closing in on a spot in the top 20 largest cryptocurrencies, with a market cap of nearly $4 billion. Is $0.8 Within Reach For XLM? A look at the broader market shows that XLM has been underwhelming in recent days. Although the token scored some significant gains last month, it appears to have also been affected by the dour market conditions in July. Following the positive price movement of yesterday, investors are hoping to see the XLM price visit the $0.8 again. However, after hitting its all-time high of $0.875563 in 2018, the coin has only ever reached the $0.8 level once. Related Reading: XRP Price Retreats After Massive 80% Rally, Buy The Dips?

42393116,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgG1hN,1689331699,Bitcoin's Crypto Market Dominance Slides by Most in 13 Months as XRP Court Ruling Spurs 'Alt Season' Talk,"Bitcoin's (BTC) share of the total crypto market, known as its dominance, tanked Thursday after a U.S. court complicated the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) plan to regulate digital assets and spurred hopes for a sustained outperformance of alternative cryptocurrencies, often called the ""alt season.""  In a highly anticipated ruling in the SEC's case against Ripple Labs for violating securities law through XRP sales, the District Court for the Southern District of New York ruled that XRP is not a security when offered to individuals through centralized exchanges, but is one when sold directly to institutions.  The distinction in the ruling essentially threw a spanner in SEC's plan to paint all altcoins with the same brush and subject them to stringent oversight by categorizing them as securities.  Bitcoin's dominance rate fell 2.6% to 50.14% after the court ruling, the biggest one-day decline since June 13, 2022, according to data from charting platform TradingView. Altcoins like XRP, SOL, MATIC and ADA chalked out double-digit gains, outshining bitcoin by a big margin.  Some observers foresee potential for a continue outperformance of altcoins over the near term.  ""Alt season may be upon us following the Ripple news as indicators collectively suggest risk appetite is funneling down the risk continuum,"" Decentral Park Capital said in a market update published Thursday. ""With the U.S. dollar breaking down and the inflation battle nearing the end, it appears to be game on for investors.""  In contrast, Noelle Acheson, author of the Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, said the ruling could help Coinbase in its legal tussle with the SEC, but cautioned against predicting an outsized altcoin rally.  Early last month, the SEC charged cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase and its offshore rival Binance for offering unregistered securities, a move that injected uncertainty into the market.  ""The ruling should be enough to reawaken greater interest in the shifting market narrative, which itself could be enough to bring in new flows,"" Acheson told CoinDesk.  ""However, it's premature to assume that a 'win' is in the bag – the SEC will likely appeal the decision, and given some of the inconsistencies, it might win. At best, the uncertainty will drag on for longer. So, it feels too soon for alt season; that will probably wait until we get greater clarity on the Coinbase case,"" Acheson said.  In a note to clients on Friday, analysts at K33 Research voiced a similar opinion, saying, ""the ruling will be appealed and might even be reversed, so we expect the ongoing battle to continue.""  The court also found Ripple violated securities law when selling XRP directly to institutions. So institutions that bought XRP can come under the regulatory scanner, injecting further uncertainty into the market.

According to data from CoinMarketCap, Cardano (ADA) has gained by 28.43% in the last 24 hours, with several other altcoins also posting double digits gains. Cardano (ADA) Price Action And Analysis Prior to its price boost yesterday, ADA had shown little to no movement all week, hovering around the $0.29 price mark. However, the token’s price spiked yesterday afternoon, reaching as high as $0.37 for the first time since early June. Related Reading: XRP Price Retreats After Massive 80% Rally, Buy The Dips? Looking at its broader performance, Cardano has had a mixed-price action since the start of 2023. The altcoin began the year in style, gaining over 70% to trade at $0.41 as of February 16. This price surge was, however, followed by a bearish trend bringing the token’s price as low as $0.30 on March 10. Thereafter, ADA would resume its bullish trajectory, rising to its highest price so far in 2023 at $0.45 on April 16. Over the next two months, Cardano’s price slumped once again before showing sideways movement over the last three weeks. Analyzing its 4-Hour Chart, ADA has encountered resistance at the $0.38 price zone and appears to be experiencing a recorrection. However, a rise in selling pressure could result in the token trading as low as $0.28, which marks its imminent support level. On the other hand, if the bulls retake control and manage to push past the $0.38 resistance price level, ADA is likely to rise to $0.42, which represents the next major resistance level. At the time of writing, ADA is trading at $0.35 with a 2.30% loss in the last hour. The token’s trading volume is up by a stunning 808.08% and is valued at $1.4 billion. With a market cap of $12.3 billion, Cardano is ranked as the 7th biggest cryptocurrency in the world. ADA Trading At $0.35 On The 4-Hour Chart| Source: ADAUSD Chart On Tradingview.com Ripple’s Victory Sparks Altcoin Rally Yesterday afternoon, U.S. Judge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP is not a security in the ongoing Ripple vs. SEC case. On the emergence of this news, the crypto market experienced a price boost, with mainly altcoins notching significant gains. Asides from Cardano (ADA), coins such as Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), and Polygon (MATIC), are also on the rise, recording profits at 31.98%, 14.50%, and 17.76%, respectively, in the last 24 hours.

SEC loses millions of taxpayer dollars After a 3-year long court battle and millions of US taxpayer dollars spent on fighting the case by the SEC the judge has mainly come down on the side of Ripple, which also spent more than $200 million on legal costs. As the judgement is digested across the crypto sector, the ramifications of this ruling can potentially be massive for other crypto companies that are in dispute with the SEC, although there is still the possibility that the US securities regulator may decide to appeal the decision. the crypto market literally exploded $XRP explodes Be that as it may, when the news broke on Thursday afternoon the crypto market literally exploded. $XRP, the native token of Ripple, went on a vertical trajectory that took it as far as 97% up on the day. It has since fallen back to resistance at $0.78 which it will now likely turn into support. Those long on bitcoin used the market surge to propel the king of the cryptos past $31,000, which it looks to have turned into support, potentially giving it the platform to drive up from this level, one that has kept bitcoin from rising higher since April. Now that this level could be about to be broken and flipped into support, bitcoin could act like a beachball that has been kept under water and finally been released. An upsurge to $37,000 and even potentially $45,000 could be next. Solana makes hay Plenty of other cryptocurrencies made hay while the Ripple/$XRP sun shone. Among these, the most notable was Solana ($SOL). Between Thursday afternoon and Friday morning $SOL rose almost 50%. A high of $32 was reached before the lightning fast layer 1 settled back down to around $29.40 at time of going to press. Once past $30 again, the next resistance is at $38.70. Now that things appear so much more positive for tokens that have been deemed securities by the SEC, such as $SOL, the shackles are now well and truly off and true growth can happen. Altcoins embark on bull market The Total 3 market cap (all cryptocurrencies except bitcoin and ethereum) shot up like a rocket on Thursday, driving through the top of a downwards channel it has been following since mid 2022. The price has come back to test the top of this channel, and should it hold above, it’s onwards and upwards for the altcoins in what can become the early stages of the next crypto bull market.

In simple language, Vitalik Buterin and his fellow co-founders of Ethereum wanted the blockchain to be able to do things other than just send payments, which was Bitcoin’s primary and only use-case at the time. Fast forward eight years, and now Bitcoin is able to do all kinds of things that it couldn’t before. Some projects have made Bitcoin compatible with smart contracts, enabling it to be used with the plethora of dApps in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, and even allowing NFTs known as ‘Ordinals’ to be created on Bitcoin for the first time. Enter Ordinals - Bitcoin’s Own NFTs The success of Ordinals - which inscribe immutable data, such as texts, images and audio - onto a satoshi (the smallest unit of BTC) has been immense. Upon launch they clogged up the Bitcoin blockchain, causing exchanges such as Binance to temporarily halt withdrawals and bringing the Bitcoin network to a grinding halt. The impact of Ordinals was also felt off the blockchain. The idea of using the Bitcoin blockchain to create what is essentially an NFT (Ordinals share the same characteristics of immutability and non-fungibility) caused a rift between developers in the Bitcoin space. Bitcoin was supposed to be a payment network, said one faction. While others lauded this newfound ability to have the same kind of functionality, customization options, and value creation that they’d seen in the Ethereum ecosystem for years. While developers continue to debate the merits of Ordinals, users in the crypto space have apparently embraced them with open arms. Bitcoin Ordinals trading volume rose by an astonishing 2,834% leading into Q2 of 2023, climbing to $210.7 million. More than half a million trades were executed by over 150,000 unique traders, according to the latest data by DappRadar. Overtaking Ethereum That flurry of activity led to Ordinals overtaking Ethereum NFTs in terms of trade volume. The top two NFT collections with the highest sales are Bitcoin Ordinals, according to data from CryptoSlam. Their combined sales of $27.2 million in the past 24 hours completely dwarf the nearest Ethereum NFT in third place, which recorded just $1.59 million worth of sales. Some have suggested that Bitcoin is currently in the process of flipping Ethereum when it comes to being the main home of NFTs in the crypto space based on the numbers above. However, the true impact of Ordinals on Bitcoin is much more far-reaching. As the author of the Ethereum white-paper, Vitalik Buterin, stated in regard to the Ordinals debate: “Ordinals are starting to bring back a culture of actually doing things. It feels like there's real pushback to the laser-eye movement, which is good.” The laser-eye movement refers to those who view Bitcoin purely as a payment system, and base their hopes of future profits on its adoption as a global payment rail. One of the main gripes many ‘laser-eye’ loyalists have had with Ordinals is their tendency to take up space on the Bitcoin blockchain that could have been used for payments. Building an Ecosystem Around Ordinals But the spirit of innovation fostered by the creation of Ordinals hasn’t stopped. Several ventures are under way that aim to refine the Ordinals landscape. One group of developers are trying to introduce a new BTC token standard - BRC-69 - aims to radically reduce the cost of minting and sending Ordinals, moving Ordinals away from the current BRC-20 standard on which they are based. Others are attempting to build a community mentality around the newfound Bitcoin NFTs, and kickstart an ecosystem of development that can put Bitcoin on a level with Ethereum in regards to its decentralized finance capabilities. A collection of some of the smartest minds in the blockchain space have come together to form The Ordinal Council, a group of builders, developers and executives who share the common goal of building out the Bitcoin ecosystem around Ordinals. The Ordinal Council is in the process of launching the first Bitcoin DAO to support grassroots talent and builders around Ordinals and BRC-20, and will form a Bitcoin incubator to help develop a raft of innovative use-cases on Bitcoin, such as gaming, metaverse, GameFi and DeFi projects — few of which have been possible on Bitcoin until now. The Council is set to unveil the first launchpad on Bitcoin - ToshiPad - in the next few weeks, and is in the process of executing its ‘Yellow Collection’ PFP drop, which aims to bring more users into what is already a burgeoning BRC-20 ecosystem. After years of inactivity, all it took was one little satoshi with something inscribed on it to kickstart a maelstrom of innovation and development on Bitcoin, and it’s turning the crypto space upside down.

This was more than 50% of the total trading volumes on UpBit in that period. Data shows market depth stood at nearly $5 million as of Asian morning hours, suggesting ample liquidity for the tokens as a $5 million buy or sell order would move the tokens only 2% on the exchange. Such liquidity is usually under $1 million, historical data shows.  The surge came as a U.S. court ruled the sale of XRP on exchanges did not constitute investment contracts. XRP rose as much as 96% following the court order before giving back gains on Friday morning.  Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) usually account for the majority of the trading activity on UpBit, which makes the XRP volume surge an anomaly. Overall, ten South Korean exchanges turned billions of dollars worth of XRP - contributing to a significant part of the $13 billion in volumes across global exchanges.  Crypto exchange Binance, in comparison, traded a relatively lesser $2.2 million, CoinGecko data shows.  In crypto circles, South Korean traders are known for pushing euphoric rallies on tokens. The so-called Kimchi Premium originates from the region – where prices of bitcoin on local exchanges can trade at a premium of as much as 30% compared to international counterparts, driven by local demand.

The launch comes at a time when anticipation in the United States for a spot Bitcoin ETF is building following BlackRock’s filing. A Long Delay The Bitcoin ETF, filed by the London-based multi-asset investment platform Jacobi Asset Management, was originally set to debut on the Euronext Amsterdam Exchange in July 2022. However, the launch was delayed due to unprecedented market conditions triggered by the spectacular collapse of the Terra ecosystem in May and the collapse of FTX in November. Both events created turmoil in the markets, forcing Jacobi Asset Management to delay the listing. The ETF had received approval from the Guernsey Financial Services Commission (GFSC) to launch as far back as October 2021. The delay in launch has only served to heighten market expectations as investors eagerly await an avenue to tap into the Bitcoin market with the security of an ETF structure. Many believe the launch of a European ETF could usher in a new era for Bitcoin in European markets. The spot Bitcoin ETF will allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without owning the underlying asset. A Shift In Demand The multi-asset investment platform explained that it had decided to launch the spot Bitcoin ETF now because of a gradual shift in demand compared to 2022. Additionally, it added that it is still assessing its launch strategy and would be announcing a launch date soon. The Jacobi spot Bitcoin ETF is a centrally cleared, crypto-backed financial instrument, the custody of which is supported by Fidelity Digital Assets. The ETF marks a significant shift away from exchange-traded notes (ETNs). Europe has typically structured all crypto-backed financial instruments as exchange-traded notes rather than funds. The key difference between exchange-traded notes and exchange-traded funds is that ETN investors own debt security, while ETF shareholders own a part of the fund’s underlying assets. Gensler And SEC Look To Play Spoilsport While European markets are readying themselves for the region’s first spot Bitcoin ETF, the United States is lagging far behind. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has so far rejected all spot Bitcoin ETFs. However, US markets have registered a surge of interest in spot Bitcoin ETFs following BlackRock’s recent filing. BlackRock is arguably one of the biggest asset management firms in the world, and its filing could indicate a shift in sentiment and perception of Bitcoin. In fact, 2023 has seen some of the biggest institutional giants, including Fidelity, file fresh spot Bitcoin ETF applications as the race to become the first US-approved spot Bitcoin ETF gathers steam. The Securities and Exchange Commission had already approved Bitcoin futures ETFs in 2021. US markets were optimistic following the BlackRock filing, the Securities and Exchange Commission under Gary Gensler has decided to toe an all too familiar line by rejecting all ETF filings. According to the SEC, the spot Bitcoin filings were inadequate, hence the rejection. However, BlackRock has refiled its application for its iShares Bitcoin Trust exchange-traded fund. According to the new submission, Nasdaq has entered into a surveillance-share agreement with Coinbase, which addresses one of the main objections raised by the SEC. Following BlackRock’s amendments, other firms such as Fidelity, WisdomTree, and Invesco will also be updating their ETF filings. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Spacemesh chose the date of July 14th, which commemorates the storming of the Bastille, as the day to launch the People's Coin. The goal is to establish a cryptocurrency that can achieve widespread distribution, particularly among younger generations and underprivileged demographics who are currently unable to participate in the cryptocurrency revolution due to insurmountable barriers to entry Spacemesh, The People’s Coin, is born today. Spacemesh’s team of cryptographers, led by Prof. Tal Moran, spent over 5 years building a radically novel way to achieve consensus in the permissionless setting from scratch. Instead of the commonly-used PoW or PoStake, Spacemesh uses PoST (Proof of Space-Time) Rather than a Chain topology (i.e., a blockchain), Spacemesh uses a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph), a.k.a. a “mesh” Additionally, rather than the winner-takes-all paradigm via Lottery (“Competitive Mining”) used by all Nakamoto-based consensus protocols, Spacemesh uses lottery-free, non-competitive “leaderless” voting (“Collaborative Mining”) Lastly, instead of generating a new proof for every challenge, which is energy intensive, Spacemesh miners reuse the original proof continually—resulting in extremely low energy use and near-zero ongoing costs for operating a miner The Spacemesh protocol ensures fairness for smaller home miners by rewarding them based on their storage commitment size during each epoch, which occurs approximately every two weeks. This prevents powerful miners, including adversarial ones, from receiving a disproportionate share of rewards. Spacemesh also has significantly lower barriers to entry compared to other permissionless cryptocurrencies. To become a miner (smesher), all that is required is a PC with available storage space, any GPU with OpenCL support, and a reliable internet connection. Specialized mining equipment is unnecessary, and ongoing power usage is low, resulting in minimal electricity bills. Additionally, there is no need for deposits, bank accounts, or credit cards. The combination of low entry barriers, low operational costs, and incentive compatibility, establishes a novel guarantee of fair distribution. Once a miner joins the network by committing the minimum required storage, they become an active participant and receive a fair share of rewards during each epoch. This share is likely sufficient to cover any electricity expenses or hardware replacement costs. The low marginal costs for home users, coupled with the absence of competition-based rewards, encourage small miners to join the network. This leads to a diverse ecosystem where even smaller participants can actively contribute without being priced out. Regardless of how many other participants join the network, every miner is guaranteed to receive their fair share of rewards consistently and predictably. There are no more races for big payouts or reliance on luck through lotteries. “To reach its full revolutionary potential, crypto cannot be introduced as stocks, e.g. gamble money you don’t have, nor as an elites-only hobby. We must by necessity offer these users a better deal: Come as you are, with whatever PC you already own, and the know-how already have — no other out-of-pocket expenses are needed at any time. It’s the only conceivable way to have a widespread currency that impacts the people who need it most.” explains Tomer Afek, the co-founder and CEO of SpaceMesh. “As the People’s Coin, everything we do, everything we write—the code and apps we ship—should be understandable, accessible, legible, and usable by regular people. This has profound implications for our design, UX, engineering, and economics.” he adds. Spacemesh’s Team is dedicated to breaking down barriers that prevent the benefits of cryptocurrency from reaching more people. We are committed to continuously lowering entry barriers, ensuring that more diverse demographics can participate in the crypto revolution. Our goal is to create a more equitable world, fostering improved cooperation on local, national, and global scales. By making crypto accessible to all, we believe we can contribute to a future that is fairer and more inclusive for everyone.

The recent victory of Ripple against the US Securities and Exchange Commission has sparked a sea of green, with investors expressing renewed confidence in the industry. Related Reading: Cardano Development Activity Dropping – What Does It Mean For ADA Price? In this flourishing environment, Optimism Network’s OP coin stands tall, exhibiting an impressive surge of nearly 15% in the past seven days. But can the Optimism Network sustain its upward trajectory in the face of regulatory challenges? OP Bulls Target $1.3 Resistance Level In the ever-changing landscape of the cryptocurrency market, the current price of OP coin on CoinGecko hits $1.38, reflecting a noteworthy rally of 14.2% over the past 24 hours. Additionally, within the last seven days, the coin has experienced an impressive surge of 14.7%. Source: Coingecko Since the first week of July, OP has been trading below the $1.3 mark. However, an OP price report notes that bullish investors are eyeing this crucial threshold to flip the H2 structure (see chart below) into a bullish trend. The $1.3 resistance level has posed a challenge for the OP coin’s value, preventing it from surpassing this critical point. Bulls in the market are striving to overcome this hurdle, which would signal a potentially bullish trend for the coin. Breaking through a resistance level requires bulls to employ various strategies and leverage market dynamics to their advantage. One approach is to increase buying pressure by generating higher demand for the asset. This can be achieved through positive news, improved market sentiment, or attracting new investors. By accumulating buying orders, bulls can potentially overpower selling pressure and propel the price beyond the resistance level. Related Reading: PEPE Price Drops More Than 60% From ATH – What Lies Ahead? Technical analysis plays a crucial role as well. Bulls carefully analyze price charts and employ technical indicators to identify patterns, trends, and potential entry points. They look for signals that indicate a breakout or reversal in price movement. OP market cap currently at $912 million.

14874239,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=542643,1689321308,Why Is Bitcoin Price Up Today?,"The Bitcoin price tagged a new yearly high yesterday at $31,840, leaving market participants wondering about the driving forces behind this bullish momentum. The Power of Economic Indicators One of the crucial factors contributing to Bitcoin’s upward trajectory was the release of the United States Producer Price Index (PPI) data. The latest figures revealed a significant slowdown in inflation, with PPI YoY dropping to 0.1% in June, surpassing expectations and marking the smallest pace since August 2020. Notably, the Core PPI YoY came in at 2.4%, slightly below the estimated 2.6%, reinforcing the notion of a diminishing inflationary environment. This decrease in PPI is seen as a positive sign for the Consumer Price Index (CPI), providing hope for a more stable economic landscape. Macro researcher Mortensen Bach emphasized the significance of the PPI’s impact, stating, “PPI always leads CPI. Inflation is no longer a thing and input prices clearly indicate that! Deflation remains the primary risk going forward. This is what happens when you have a Federal Reserve who is blindly focused on backward-looking data!” Echoing these sentiments, macro analyst Ted added, “PPI inflation leads CPI by a few months… and today’s PPI numbers have YoY running at +0.24%. Almost in deflation! Fed pivot anyone?” Related Reading: Perfect Storm: Why Bitcoin & Crypto Are Poised For A Dramatic Recovery Also worth noting is that, May PPI inflation was revised lower from 1.1% to 0.9%. May Core PPI inflation was revised lower from 2.8% to 2.6%. The drop and revision lower in Core PPI is what the US Federal Reserve wants to see. Inverse Correlation With The DXY Another pivotal factor driving Bitcoin’s surge is the recent drop in the US Dollar Index (DXY) below 100.00, a level not seen in 15 months. This development has sparked renewed interest in risk assets like Bitcoin as a hedge against a weakening dollar. The inverse correlation between the DXY and Bitcoin has historically played a significant role in the cryptocurrency’s price movements, and this recent drop in the DXY has acted as yet another bullish catalyst. Ripple’s Partial Victory The ongoing legal battle between Ripple Labs and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has probably provided another boost to Bitcoin’s price. Ripple’s partial victory in the case has generated optimism in the crypto community and can be seen as a net positive event for Coinbase, which is embroiled in its own legal dispute with the SEC. Related Reading: Fund Manager Vanguard Increases Stake In Bitcoin Mining Stocks To $600 Million Interestingly, Coinbase serves as the exchange partner for all U.S. Bitcoin spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) currently filed with the SEC. Recently, chair Gary Gensler’s comments on Coinbase’s involvement in ETF filings have raised concerns about the suitability of the exchange as a market surveillance sharing partner, as Bitcoinist reported. Eric Balchunas, a Senior ETF analyst for Bloomberg, expressed his apprehension, suggesting that “SSA could be pointless if this is a problem for him.” With this in mind, the Ripple victory can also be seen as extremely positive news for the approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF, as Coinbase could benefit from the ruling in its case against the SEC. At press time, the BTC price retraced to $31,250, up 2.6% in the last 24 hours.

A closer reading of the court’s ruling shows that the judge specifically did not reject that argument, the report said.  The SEC said it was suing the Nasdaq-listed crypto exchange on allegations of violating federal securities law. According to the regulator, Coinbase has operated as an unregistered broker, exchange and clearing agency simultaneously. It solicited customers, handled orders, allowed for bids and acted as an intermediary all at once, the SEC said.  The judge’s ruling “pertained solely to the primary market transactions through which Ripple sold XRP, while COIN is in the business of facilitating secondary-market transactions on its exchange,” the analysts wrote.  Berenberg says the judge’s decision that XRP on a standalone basis is not a security is “immaterial in the context of COIN since she also acknowledges that the sale of XRP can in fact represent a securities transaction.”  The German investment bank has a hold rating on Coinbase shares and a price target of $39. The stock closed yesterday at $107.

Bernstein notes that the court did rule that institutional sales of XRP violated securities law. Still, this was a major verdict, which removes the overhang on XRP and the holders of the token who bought it through exchanges, the report said.  The ruling reduces the “securities overhang on tokens sold on exchanges,” and is a “major relief for all tokens sold on secondary platforms,” analysts led by Gautam Chhugani wrote.  The court’s decision emphasizes the need for a separate digital assets framework, and given its interpretation it is clear that the “Howey test cannot be straight applied to tokens on exchange platforms, and thus the context of the transaction matters,” the note said.  “This weakens the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) stance that the securities law is clear and no separate clarity is required for digital assets, given the contextual interpretation required in every case,” the analysts wrote.  Bernstein says this is a landmark judgement and significantly shifts the “regulatory cloud over the crypto industry”, and it expects institutional investors who have steered clear of digital assets due to regulatory challenges to reconsider the asset class.

On Thursday, the District Court for the Southern District of New York said Ripple's offer and sale of XRP on digital asset exchanges did not amount to offers and sales of investment contracts as alleged by the SEC.  The Court, however, said that Ripple's direct sale of XRP worth over $700 million to institutions, hedge funds and other parties violated securities laws. The SEC, in late 2020, filed a lawsuit against Ripple for selling unregistered securities after the company sold $1.3 billion worth of XRP.

The first part of the ruling has opened doors for a renewed listing of XRP by centralized exchanges. Crypto.com has already taken the step and Gemini is exploring the listing of XRP for both spot and derivatives trading.  Meanwhile, the second part of the ruling has determined that XRP is a security, according to CoinShares’ Head of Product, Townsend Lansing.

As such, XRP is not only deemed a security, but questions have arisen regarding the legality of its offering. In regards to these sales, the Court has confirmed that the law was indeed violated, marking a considerable victory for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and setting a precedent for its legal actions against other cryptocurrencies,"" Langsing said in an email.  ""It is important to note that institutional investors who purchased directly from Ripple may find themselves subject to class-action litigation as potential underwriters. This is an area to watch closely, especially if big-name venture capitalists were involved,"" Langsing added.  Traders have yet to focus on the second part of the ruling, as evident from the price surge and the bullish positioning in the perpetual futures market.  Perpetual futures are like standard futures contracts with no expiry or settlement date.  Data from Coinglass show aggregated volume-weighted perpetual futures funding rates worldwide have jumped to the highest since at least December. The open interest-weighted rates have risen to a four-month high.  Both suggest the leverage is decisively skewed to the bullish side.  Funding rates are periodic payments of an asset between bullish long and bearish short position holders in the perpetual futures market. A positive funding rate means longs are dominant and are paying shorts to keep their positions open.",POSITIVE,XRP | BNB,MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP | BNB,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/14/xrp-pushes-past-bnb-to-become-4th-largest-cryptocurrency-funding-rates-surge,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/910f119f6f383a4750a83eef1c3e7afa510e4a9b-2090x1099.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

As a result of the victory, several exchanges like Coinbase, Kraken, Bitstamp, and Gemini have said that they are exploring options to relist XRP. End of a long battle The Southern District of New York Court delivered a partial victory to Ripple in its legal battle between Ripple Labs and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As per the ruling issued by Judge Analisa Torres on July 13, 2023, Ripple's XRP token is ""not necessarily a security on its face."" The court separated Ripple's XRP sales into three categories: institutional sales, programmatic sales, and ""other distributions,"" such as employee compensation. While the court ruled in favor of the SEC regarding XRP’s institutional sales, Ripple won when it came to programmatic sales and “other distributions.” This distinction was based on the premise that institutional investors tend to have more behind-the-scenes knowledge about token activity as compared to retail investors. The ruling brought an end to SEC’s 3-year-long crusade against Ripple. Back in 2020, the regulator sued Ripple for its supposed breach of the US securities laws. Following the lawsuit, several exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken were forced to delist XRP to avoid facing the regulator’s wrath. It is important to note that the SEC has the option to appeal and potentially reverse the court’s decisions down the line. #RelistXRP Frenzy Begins Following this monumental decision, several exchanges have announced that they will ve relisting XRP. Coinbase tweeted: “Coinbase will re-enable trading for XRP (XRP) on the XRP network. Do not send this asset over other networks or your funds may be lost. Transfers for this asset remain available on @Coinbase & @CoinbaseExch in the regions where trading is supported. Trading is anticipated to begin later today, if liquidity conditions are met. Once sufficient supply of this asset is established trading on our XRP-USD, XRP-USDT and XRP-EUR trading pairs will launch in phases. Support for XRP may be restricted in some supported jurisdictions.” Gemini: “Given today's ruling that the sale of XRP on exchanges is not a security, @Gemini is exploring the listing of XRP for both spot and derivatives trading.” Bitstamp: “Welcome back $XRP! 🚀 XRP trading is available in the U.S now for our U.S customers.

Data from Coinglass shows XRP-tracked futures traders racked up a total of $58 million in losses as a U.S. judge ruled the sale of XRP tokens on exchanges did not constitute investment contracts.  Of that, shorts, or bets against price rises, lost $33 million while longs constituted the remaining. Traders at crypto exchange Bybit saw the most liquidations at $21 million, followed by OKX at $14 million and Binance at $14 million.  Liquidation refers to when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. This happens when a trader is unable to meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position or fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open.  Large liquidations can signal the local top or bottom of a price move, which may allow traders to position themselves accordingly.  Such price action came immediately after the District Court for the Southern District of New York said the “offer and sale of XRP on digital asset exchanges did not amount to offers and sales of investment contracts,” as “the record cannot establish the third Howey prong to these transactions.”  Elsewhere, the ruling caused Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA) and other altcoins to jump as traders likely considered XRP’s partial victory as a favorable outcome for the crypto market – one that has been targeted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in recent months for allegations of several issuers offering their tokens as securities to U.S. investors.",NEUTRAL,ADA | XRP,ADA | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/14/xrp-short-traders-log-highest-losses-in-2023-after-landmark-court-ruling,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0132a45bf2da5fbd328b67d1ca9912bac1826873-2937x1652.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The sudden change is all part of a possible perfect storm brewing — one that leads to a dramatic recovery and new all-time highs sooner than most would expect. “Not A Security” XRP Victory Signals Relief In Crypto The idea that cryptocurrencies could recover at all in the recent macro environment has been scoffed at throughout 2023. Layer in the impact of the SEC putting pressure on the industry by labeling certain altcoins as securities, and few wanted to risk their money on digital coins. Related Reading: Bitcoin Reaches Longest Stretch Ever Without A Bull Run But that label was just removed from XRP, and that’s all it took to double in price in just one day. XRP has since given back some of that upside, but it’s a shocking enough move to get people to start paying attention to crypto again — especially altcoins. A rising tide also tends to lift all boats. And with Bitcoin staying buoyant above $30,000 per coin, Ethereum holding above $1,800, and the “ripple effect” happening in BTC dominance as a result of the XRP move, altcoins have already started to participate. The dollar diving could help crypto climb | DXY on TradingView.com The DXY And The Perfect Storm For Bitcoin So how is this set up to be a perfect storm? Cryptocurrencies have been in oversold conditions for an extended period, and order books are thinner today than they were in 2021. It won’t take much money coming in to begin to make prices move, per XRP’s example. Today alone, hundreds of other altcoins posted substantial gains, simply because XRP is no longer labeled a security. It caused an immediate rush into other altcoins which are at bear market lows and priced at a great value compared to 2021 ATHs. Related Reading: The One Ingredient Missing From A Full-Bore Bitcoin Bull Run Given the previously mentioned macro landscape, many traders remain short Bitcoin and other coins, and could soon find themselves helping to push prices higher as they’re squeezed out of positions. Others aren’t short, but are sidelined and remains reluctant to buy in. This situation could result in chasing prices higher and higher. Finally, this perfect storm is capped off by inflation cooling, the stock market approaching ATHs, and the US Dollar weakening according to the DXY. The DXY just lost the 100-point level, which potentially sent a risk-on signal to financial markets.
