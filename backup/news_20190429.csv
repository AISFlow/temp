42402880,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAddN3l,1556562924,Novogratz's Galaxy Digital Crypto Fund Lost $272.7 Million in 2018,"Galaxy Digital Holdings, the crypto merchant bank founded by former hedge fund manager Michael Novogratz, lost $97 million in the fourth quarter, according to financials disclosed Monday.  The net loss widened from $76.7 million in the third quarter and from about $100,000 a year earlier, according to the filing with Canadian securities regulators. (Last February, New York-based Galaxy bought a Canadian publicly traded company in a reverse takeover.)  For all of 2018, its first full year of operation, the company lost $272.7 million.  The majority of the red ink in 2018, $101.4 million, came from selling digital assets at a loss.  Galaxy also recorded $75.5 million in paper losses on crypto it held that declined in price, $8.5 million in unrealized losses on investments in companies and $88.4 million in operating expenses.  Which coins lost  At the end of 2018, Galaxy held 9,724 bitcoin ($36.4 million), 92,545 ether ($12.3 million), 2.4 million EOS ($6 million) and 60,227 of monero ($2.8 million). The firm increased its investment in bitcoin and ether from the beginning of the year when it held 5,902 BTC and 57,000 ETH.  Galaxy also used to hold large amounts of Wax ($50.2 million) and BlockV tokens ($17.4 million), which disappeared from the top ranks of the firm's investments at the end of the year.  According to the report, Galaxy lost money selling bitcoin ($70.3 million) and ether ($64.4 million), which was partially offset by $54.3 million earned selling some cryptocurrencies short (it's not specified which ones).  Bitcoin was the biggest source of losses at the beginning of 2018, while ether caused the most damage during the rest of the year.  Interestingly, Galaxy lost as much as $47 million on the depreciation of the Wax token, an asset created to power a platform for trading virtual goods like items in video games.  Several other altcoins also lost in price before Galaxy could profitably sell them during 2018: Kin ($10.9 million in losses), BlockV ($17.2 million) and Aion ($8.6 million). Some $5 million was also lost on EOS.  Protocols, mining and ICOs  A number of companies and investment funds in Galaxy's portfolio declined in value.  For example, the Pantera ICO Fund LP shares' depreciation caused the loss of $14.1 million (Galaxy currently has $17.4 million invested in the fund). The firm also took a haircut of $11.3 million on its shares of Canada-based Hut 8 Mining Corp, and $11.1 million on crypto wallet firm Xapo.  As of the end of 2018, Galaxy held $41.9 million in the stock of Block.One's, the creator of EOS, plus some $5 million more in Galaxy EOS VC Fund focused on developing the EOS.IO ecosystem.  Meanwhile, payments startup Ripple Labs received $23.8 million, including ""an indirect investment through a special purpose vehicle,"" the report says.  Galaxy also invested $26 million in mining businesses, including Hut 8 Mining and Bitfury; $7.5 million in custodian and multi-signature wallet provider BitGo; and $5 million in Bakkt, the bitcoin futures exchange yet-to-be-launched by New York Stock Exchange parent ICE.  Other investments include Silvergate Capital Corporation, parent of the crypto friendly Silvergate Bank; tokenization startups AlphaPoint and Templum; investment vehicles Cryptology Asset and Pantera Venture Fund; and Mercantile Global Holdings, a Puerto Rico-based entity operating the recently founded San Juan Mercantile Exchange. The firm also provided $3.8 millions of loans for the crypto lending platform BlockFi.  Talking about the risks Galaxy may face in the future, the report pays special attention to the concentration of power in the hands of the CEO and major stakeholder Mike Novogratz, who owns more than 71 percent of Galaxy.  Among the regulatory and market risks, Galaxy is ""highly dependent on Michael Novogratz, exposing shareholders to material and unpredictable 'key man' risk,"" the document says, adding that the CEO's ""interests may be different from those of shareholders,"" and there is a danger he ""could engage in activities outside of GDH LP or could quit GDH LP in favor of other pursuits.""  No less notable, the report adds: ""Mr. Novogratz’s public profile makes it more likely that GDH LP will attract material regulatory scrutiny, which would be costly and distracting regardless of whether GDH LP has engaged in any unlawful conduct.""

42402877,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAddMyq,1556557309,Huobi Cloud Aims for 80 More Exchange Partners in Bid for Revenue Growth,"Singapore-based exchange conglomerate Huobi Group has a unique growth strategy for emerging markets: partner with local entities and then split the profits 50/50.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, the South African exchange HIZA will launch in May and join a cohort of 150 platforms under the Huobi Cloud umbrella, according to Huobi Group’s senior business director David Chen.  “We will help them get their trading volume up and we’ll expand our business when the market is more mature,” Chen said, adding that up to 80 like-minded partnerships are currently in the pipeline.  Recent expansion isn’t unique to Huobi, however. Global exchange giants like Binance are opening independent subsidiaries in emerging markets like Uganda, or investing in local exchanges the way Bittrex did with the South African exchange VALR. Similar to Bittrex, Huobi Group offers partners like HIZA access to its global order books for prime liquidity.  Interestingly, the partnership approach allows Huobi to minimize the regulatory risks of working in under-developed markets – where banking relationships require local knowledge and repercussions for unintentional missteps remain uncertain.  “They [HIZA] own their customer data, it’s not Huobi that owns it, otherwise it would be Huobi’s responsibility,” Chen said.  He added that Huobi Group has earned $1.5 million in net profit since October 2018 from Cloud partnerships that have already gone live. One such partnership is with the Nigeria-based SaBi exchange, which facilitates roughly $100,000 worth of daily volume, according to SaBi founder Lucky Uwakwe.  Chen said the aim is to have such partners processing an accumulative total of roughly $55 million in daily volume by 2020.  Uwakwe said that in Nigeria, at least, his exchange has considerable regulatory hurdles to overcome if they intend to boost volumes. That’s why, Uwakwe said, his exchange is taking a multi-pronged approach with both peer-to-peer (P2P) and over-the-counter (OTC) services.  “We are creating options to give us room in case the government decides to shut down our operations with the banks,” he said. “We want to create options for users so that they can do what is more comfortable for them.”  Risk arbitrage  To be clear, none of these jurisdictions have outlawed crypto as much as they have yet to implement regulatory standards comparable with Western or even Asian markets.  “Bitcoin trading was not banned,” Nigerian lawyer Faith Obafemi told CoinDesk. “However, banks and other financial institutions were banned from investing in cryptos.”  On the other hand, HIZA founder Talha Idris told CoinDesk the South African government is starting to take a more proactive approach.  “They are seeking comments on [research] and will probably update regulations accordingly,” Idris said, speaking of local authorities. “Huobi will be helping us with all the technical aspects, especially security.”  This could turn out to be a lucrative play for Huobi Group, as a national survey by HootSuite in January 2019 found that 11 percent of South African mobile users own some cryptocurrency.  Plus, P2P exchanges like Paxful have already demonstrated that demand in various African markets, including Nigeria and South Africa, is growing even during broader market slumps. This is, in part, spurred by strict capital controls in each of those countries.  Speaking of local demand, SaBi’s Uwakwe added:  “We’ve got the drive. Even when there are many bans and restrictions, people find a way to get these things. When it comes to our daily volume, we actually do quite a lot.”  Johannesburg, South Africa image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/04/29/huobi-cloud-aims-for-80-more-exchange-partners-in-bid-for-revenue-growth,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dfb250c1a6fd8afe2283666f94129a818646584a-1500x844.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is temporarily suspending trading of shares in a little-known, self-described crypto exchange and mining firm called Bitcoin Generation (BTGN).  The regulator announced Monday that it was suspending trading until 11:59 P.M. Eastern Daylight Time on May 10, 2019 (or 03:59 UTC May 11) due to concerns that some information BTGN has made public may be inaccurate.  Specifically, the SEC is concerned about a bond that BTGN ""purportedly acquired from an entity based in the United Kingdom""; how much BTGN stock is outstanding; promotional activity related to BTGN; and the ""accuracy and adequacy of current public information regarding BTGN's financial condition.""  The notice added:  ""The Commission cautions broker-dealers, shareholders, and prospective purchasers that they should carefully consider the foregoing information along with all other currently available information and any information subsequently issued by the company.""  Crypto in the Heartland  Based in Bartlesville, Oklahoma, Bitcoin Generation describes itself on its website as a crypto exchange, offering dollar trading pairs with bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin (listed twice), bitcoin cash SV, monero and XRP (listed as ""Ripple,"" despite that company's insistence it does not control the cryptocurrency).  The site also claims the company runs a mining facility with more than 10,000 machines.  According to Bloomberg, Bitcoin Generation's most recent income statement dates back to the third quarter of 2015, though no data from that period was available.  One of Bitcoin Generation's board members listed by Bloomberg is Janice Gray of Inolife Technologies, the firm trading under the BTGN ticker according to Google.

42402878,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAddMzp,1556554432,Schnorr Upgrade Set for Inclusion in Next Bitcoin Cash Hard Fork,"Bitcoin cash's next hard fork is almost here, a development that could enact a much-anticipated code change.  Slated for May 15, the blockchain update is particularly interesting because it includes Schnorr signatures, a scaling and privacy code change originally proposed by Blockstream co-founder Pieter Wuille for the bitcoin network.  Bitcoin cash developers have long been critical of bitcoin's technical roadmap, as the project's history shows. That's why the relatively small group split off from bitcoin in the first place after years of fierce social media battles and accusations of censorship across bitcoin's dedicated subreddits. But as critical as bitcoin cash enthusiasts might be of Segregated Witness (SegWit), lightning, and other technologies, they agree that Schnorr is the right move.  The code adding Schnorr to bitcoin cash was originally released three months before the activation date in May. Since it is a hard fork -- a change which is not backwards-compatible -- all participants in the ecosystem must upgrade their software to stay on the same cryptocurrency network.  In conversation with CoinDesk, bitcoin cash app CoinText CTO Vin Armani framed it as a competition:  ""[There's] really not much to write home about in this upgrade except for the fact that [bitcoin] devs have been wanting to add Schnorr signatures for a long time and [bitcoin cash] beat them to it.""  On the other hand, Blockstream developer Jonas Nick thinks this is a good sign for bitcoin. Bitcoin's last big change, SegWit, led to the aforementioned couple of years war. But Schnorr is far from generating the same strife.  ""This is a good indication that there would be no controversy over adding Schnorr signatures in a bitcoin [soft fork],"" Nick told CoinDesk.  Why Schnorr matters  So, what's the value of Schnorr?  In order to cryptographically prove that you own some bitcoin and send funds to someone else, you must ""sign"" with a private key. The signature scheme used today in bitcoin is Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA).  But Schnorr is an improvement over what bitcoin employs today. In short, it is able to bundle signatures together, making it possible to less data than ECDSA, thereby improving a cryptocurrency's scalability.  ""In layman's terms, that means that the software is able to verify several signatures at once, for instance eight, in a way that is faster than verifying one signature eight times,"" leading bitcoin cash developer Amaury Sechet told CoinDesk.  At the same time it improves privacy, an exciting addition for users who don't want the whole world to know what they're buying with bitcoin.  Bitcoin couldn't use Schnorr signatures from the beginning because they were patented and not allowed to be openly used until a few years ago when the patent expired. As such, bitcoin developers, led by Wuille, have been eyeing adding the new signature scheme to bitcoin for quite some time, working behind-the-scenes to put it into practice.  And while bitcoin and bitcoin cash developers have had their disagreements, bitcoin cash decided the idea was a good one. As far back as February 2017, Sechet wrote in a blog post outlining how they work: ""Schnorr signatures are very interesting beasts.""  A bit later, in July 2017, Sechet was caught copying Schnorr test code from Bitcoin Core's github. Open source code is intended to be shared so others can work with it, but Sechet took the code and put his name in Wuille's place, only making a few changes. This violates the MIT open source license stamped at the top of the code, which allows ""very limited restriction on reuse,"" labeling just one condition, which Sechet did not follow:  ""The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the software.""  Notably, though, Sechet sees the situation differently. While he did copy most of the code, he fixed a vulnerability: that the original code did not include ""public key prefixing,"" making Schnorr more secure.  ""At the time, I thought this was a mistake made by the bitcoin developer and proposed to implement Schnorr on bitcoin cash that is similar to what edDSA does rather than what Bitcoin Core developers chose to do and faced heavy criticism for it,"" Sechet said.  All that said, a few years later, bitcoin cash is now about to enact Schnorr via a hard fork.  This type of change is controversial for a bundle of nuanced reasons. To oversimplify, bitcoin developers prefer so-called ""soft forks,"" which are backwards-compatible, allowing users who don't upgrade to the old rules to still send transactions to those running the new rules. They are wary of hard fork changes because they see them as a centralization concern, since they are not backwards-compatible and it's hard to determine if everyone using the blockchain wants to go along with the change.  Meanwhile, bitcoin cash developers see hard forks as an easier way to make dramatic changes to their blockchain.  ""The hard fork process generally allows a blockchain to deploy features with much less code and exploitable edge conditions. I think you would find that industry-wide most blockchains use hard forks for that reason,"" Bitcoin Unlimited developer Andrew Stone told CoinDesk.  Fancier future  While the hard fork is a big step, bitcoin cash developers still plan to take some additional steps to make the best use of the new signature scheme.  Cryptocurrency marketplace OpenBazaar lead developer Chris Pacia, who also develops for bitcoin cash noted that they'll use this scheme to eventually introduce ""aggregate signatures across inputs.""  ""In other words only one signature per transaction no matter how many inputs which would reduce the transaction size quite a bit and reduce validation time,"" he said.  To do this they plan to implement something along the lines of MuSig, long-in-the-making technology that bitcoin tech startup Blockstream recently released a test version of. But this technology ""has has never been deployed in anything protecting people's money"" Pacia said, ""so I think the plan is to wait until MuSig has seen more usage and people are happy that it's secure.""  Not to mention, even though bitcoin cash has been quick to add Schnorr signatures as an option to the protocol, it might take a while for the change to reach normal users. Bitcoin cash app and wallet developers still need to add support for it so that their users can take advantage of it, which could take more time.  Armani argued that ""there should be no impact at all"" on his app CoinText because they have ""no immediate plans to implement Schnorr signatures.""  ""It might be something we do down the line, but it's not on our roadmap for this year,"" he added.

Bakkt did not reveal how much it spent to acquire the custodian.  To further aid its storage solutions, Bakkt has been working with global bank BNY Mellon to set up ""geographically-distributed"" private key storage, White wrote.  BNY Mellon has a long history of storing institutional clients' assets, including hedge funds, asset managers and broker-dealers, he said.  The exchange has also secured insurance for funds stored offline.  ""Bakkt uses both warm (online) and cold (offline) wallet architecture to secure customer funds.

According to a report from The Times on Sunday, the Aston Plaza project in Dubai – launched in 2017 by high-profile U.K. entrepreneurs Baroness Michelle Mone and Doug Barrowman – appears to have stalled, with its website still displaying the project as ""25 percent complete,"" the same figure as used in its marketing materials.  Aston Plaza plan was unveiled in September 2017. Said at the time to be costing £250 million ($323 million) to build, the two-tower complex was to feature 1,133 luxury apartments over 2.4 million square feet, with each flat costing between $133,000 and $379,000 in bitcoin.  According to The Times, government inspectors visited the construction site in January 2018 and declared the project as “on hold.” Construction, planned for completion by this summer, is no longer underway, according to the report.  Baroness Mone is also a lingerie designer and peer of the U.K.'s House of Lords, while Barrowman, her life and business partner, is a business mogul and founder of private equity firm Aston Ventures. Together, the two launched the real estate project specifically targeting the blockchain and crypto community.  Barrowman told CoinDesk at the time that he felt the venture was the perfect opportunity for bitcoin investors to convert their holdings into “real brick-and-mortar” assets.  He also said in a statement at the time:  “I wanted to offer the property, tech and blockchain community a unique and exclusive opportunity by merging the property and tech sectors together in a true first for the industry.”  The project was accepting payments in bitcoin through U.S.-based cryptocurrency payments processor BitPay.

One of the co-founders of we.trade, Mancone said he was proud to have led the platform as it became a legal entity and to have seen it grow from seven banks to 14.  However, he said his own personal vision brings the need for “exploring the next steps” of what blockchain technology can achieve and “staying ahead of the curve.”  He told CoinDesk:  “I have not yet seen something that shows the ultimate benefit of the technology. We are building solutions that are perceived as valuable by the providers of the solutions, not the users.”  During his time at the helm of the IBM-based platform, Mancone saw we.trade became one of the first enterprise blockchain projects to go live, out-flanking all its rivals in the busy trade finance distributed ledger (DLT) space.  Mancone praised both IBM and we.trade’s member banks for the progress they had made. “I admire the courage of the banks for entering into something so innovative in a highly regulated environment,” he said.  He also reiterated how he sees enterprise blockchains evolve to include a range of companies from overlapping industries – a point he made last year when he hinted that we.trade could join forces with IBM and Maersk’s Tradelense and other supply chain platforms.  When all the stakeholders belong to the same industry (as is the case with a group of banks all focused on receivables financing) they are not fundamentally changing the business model, noted Mancone, they are just trying to make things more efficient than previously.  He explained:  “For me, that was step one. I can see how this technology can change the business model, but to do that you need the stakeholders to come from different industries, not the same industry. That way it will be the final consumer (company or corporate) that reaps the rewards, rather than a group of incumbents.”  Mancone will be replaced at we.trade at the end of April by Ciaran McGowan, who will take the title of general manager. McGowan does not come from a trade finance or banking background, having previously held technical delivery management roles with Alcon/Novartis, Retail inMotion, Pharmapod, Bank of Ireland, KBCBank, Fineos and Eontec.

42402881,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAddN2m,1556537430,Creditor Takes Crypto Startup London Block Exchange to Court,"Update (12:30 UTC, April 29, 2019): This article has been added to after new information was received from LBX CEO Benjamin Dives      A creditor has taken the London Block Exchange (LBX) to court in a bid to wind up the cryptocurrency exchange, but the startup's CEO has denied it is going out of business.  Law firm Squire Patton Boggs (UK) LLP served the petition to LBX on March 19 in London’s High Court of Justice. A hearing on the matter is scheduled to take place Tuesday, according to London Block Exchange CEO Benjamin Dives.  Russell Hill, a partner at Squire Patton Boggs, told CoinDesk:  “We filed a winding-up petition against the company as a matter of public record for a debt we are owed. At this stage, because of ongoing litigation, it’s not appropriate for me to say anything more.”  Typically a creditor asks a solicitor to wind the debtor company up to recover debts, or to stop the company from making its debts worse. This can be done by any creditor with debts over 750 British pounds (about $968) and is generally seen as a serious action to take against a firm, as it means the firm’s directors could face personal liability for the debts if they don't act quickly.  However, Dives told CoinDesk that the debt in question is only £9,900 (around $12,787). Squire Patton Boggs drafted terms and conditions for LBX's website and provided some other legal services, Dives said. The bill wasn't paid on time, so the law firm got angry and demanded a higher fee, he claimed.  ""The bill didn’t come to my attention until it was very late,"" Dives said. According to him, LBX sent the money to the law firm ""within 24 hours of the petition being issued."" However, he said he's sure the court will decide in LBX's favor, adding:  ""We're getting calls from people who think we're going out of business, but we’re not going into liquidation.""  Subsequent to that conversation, Peter McCormack, host of the popular podcast ""What Bitcoin Did,"" alleged on his Twitter feed that LBX was insolvent and owed creditors ""millions,"" and that staff had not been paid since last year. He did not identify the sources of this information.  Dives told CoinDesk: “We have been advised not to comment on Peter's claims by our lawyers.”  Funding rumors  LBX had been based in the iconic Level39 tech space in London’s Canary Wharf, which had been home to a number of crypto and blockchain firms, including the CEX.IO exchange, eToro and Revolut.  However, a representative for Level39 said LBX no longer occupied a shared workspace there and had not since 2018. (The cost of a hot desk in Level39 starts at about £400 per month, with fixed office space desks starting at about £700 per month.)  Regarding the company leaving Level39, Dives said: ""We found L39 to be an unsuitable location for security given the high level of intimacy hotdesking brings.""  One industry source told CoinDesk there had been rumors the firm was trying to raise capital in recent months. Data and APIs that would define LBX trading volumes had not been forthcoming, added the source.  Dives also pointed out that LBX has been raising capital since mid-2018 and has two ""substantial"" investments confirmed since then.  The London Block Exchange (LBX) launched in November 2017 having raised 2 million pounds (about $2.6 million) from investors, according to Business Insider.  With former Credit Suisse banker Adam Bryant as executive chairman, the company had ambitious plans for a prepaid card by which users could hold and spend crypto. That turned out to be a case of bad timing, since telco services provider WaveCrest (which worked with all the U.K. firms offering crypto-linked prepaid cards) violated its terms with Visa, essentially putting an end to this business model in the U.K.  However, LBX pivoted to become a mobile-first crypto exchange on iOS and Android, courting U.K. customers looking to trade crypto for pounds sterling. Towards the end of 2018, LBX announced it was “minting” a digital pound via a partnership with another blockchain company, AlphaPoint.  In addition, Reuters reported a deal between LBX and ClearBank to provide the exchange with banking services.  The company had also planned an LBX token sale towards the end of 2018, but later canceled it, stating: “it’s clear that the market appetite for a public token sale will not support our growth plans alone and, in fact, is likely to be detrimental to our regulatory and investment roadmap.”  London High Court of Justice image via Shutterstock.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,"Ian Allison, Anna Baydakova",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/04/29/creditor-takes-crypto-startup-london-block-exchange-to-court,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4f7cf3d00a4a2ddd9c0805eb158a141eff840a21-1500x998.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42381806,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9payX,1556535916,Bitcoin on the Defensive But May See Bounce at Key Price Support,"Bitcoin is looking south, as per the bearish divergence of the 14-day relative strength index and other short-term technical indicators.  A deeper pullback to levels below $5,000, however, would remain elusive if the 30-day moving average (MA), currently at $5,107 holds ground. That average repeatedly limited losses in March.  A rebound from the 30-day MA could be followed by re-test of recent highs above $5,600.  A UTC close below the 30-day MA would strengthen the short-term bearish case and expose the 50-day MA lined up at $4,649.  Bitcoin's (BTC) short-term prospects are looking bleak, but its close proximity to a historically strong price support level calls for caution on the part of the sellers.  The crypto market leader faced rejection at the bearish (descending) 50-week moving average (MA) last week and ended with a 2.5 percent drop, neutralizing the short-term bullish setup. A similar rejection at that average had ended up killing the nascent bull market four years ago, as discussed on Friday.  Further, with the pullback from five-month highs above $5,600 to $5,000 witnessed last week, the widely-followed 14-day relative strength index (RSI) is flashing bearish.  So, the path of least resistance appears to be on the downside in the short-term.  That said, investors looking to buy at lower levels may be left disappointed if the 30-day moving average (MA), which consistently applied brakes on price pullbacks in March, again fuels a strong bounce.  That possibility cannot be ruled out, as the longer duration charts are still looking bullish. For instance, BTC is currently sitting well above the widely tracked barometer of a long-term trend, the 200-day MA, currently at $4,438. Other long-term indicators like the 14-week RSI are also reporting bullish conditions.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $5,163 on Bitstamp, representing little change on a 24-hour basis, while the 30-day MA is located at $5,107.  Daily chart  While the 30-day MA had served as strong resistance in January, on Feb. 8, BTC confirmed seller exhaustion by establishing a bullish higher low and closing well above the 30-day MA after a 7.8 percent rise.  The newfound support has reversed price pullbacks ever since. The chart reveals BTC has established bullish higher lows along the 30-day MA throughout the recent rally, from lows near $3,300 to highs above $5,600.  Further, the long-term bullish breakout witnessed on April 2 was preceded by a higher low formation on the 30-day MA on March 26.  Hence, a bounce from that average would abort the short-term bearish view and could yield re-test of $5,627 (April 23 high).  A UTC close lower would imply an end of the rally from the Feb. 8 lows near $3,300 and allow for a deeper drop, possibly to the 50-day MA, currently at $4,649. That's supported by the short-term bearish technical setup, as represented by the lower highs on the RSI, the bearish crossover of the 5- and 10-day MAs and the downside break of the channel.  Weekly chart        BTC has created a red candle with long wicks (the gap between weekly high and opening price and weekly low and closing price) and small body (spread between open and close) on the weekly chart. The candle is widely considered a sign of indecision in the market.  The candle, however, appeared following a rally from lows near $3,300 seen in February and at the crucial 50-week MA resistance. So, it could indicate, more specifically, indecision among the buyers.  Any break below the 30-day MA would validate the bullish exhaustion signaled by the weekly candle and open the doors to deeper price pullback.  The long-term outlook will remain bullish as long as the price is holding above the former resistance-turned-support of $4,236 (Dec. 24 high).

42381804,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9paw1,1556533845,Australian Crypto Scam Reports Rose Almost 200% in 2018,"Australia saw a surge in reports of scams involving cryptocurrencies last year, according to the country's consumer watchdog.  In 674 cases, victims reported to the the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and other government agencies that cryptocurrency had been used to pay scammers in 2018, with reported losses of AU$6.1 million (US$4.3 million), the ACCC said in its tenth annual “Targeting Scams” report on Monday.  The figure is 190 percent higher than the reported AU$2.1 million (US$1.48 million) lost to crypto scams in 2017.  Online scammers generally tricked consumers into buying various cryptocurrencies through fake platforms, but when consumers tried to cash out their investments, scammers ""made excuses or were no longer contactable,"" according to the report.  Some investment scams also asked victims to pay in cryptocurrency for forex trading, commodity trading or other investment opportunities. The ACCC said, in 2018, victims of investment scams reported losing AU$2.6 million (US$1.83 million) in cryptocurrencies.  In some cases, scammers also reportedly asked victims to visit bitcoin ATMs to convert fiat into the cryptocurrency and then transfer it to them.  Of the total 674 cryptocurrency scam reports last year, almost half were made by men between the ages of 25 and 34, the commission said.  In a separate statement, ACCC deputy chair Delia Rickard, said that total combined losses (fiat and cryptocurrency) reported to the ACCC's Scamwatch program and other government agencies were higher than AU$489 million (US$345 million) – that's AU$149 million (US$105 million) more than in 2017.

This would then be transmitted to the appropriate city authorities. For instance, cars could communicate if a tree was blocking a road or a car accident had occurred, as well as providing more accurate localized weather reports.  The pilot is being conducted by the auto giant’s software engineering center in Shannon, Ireland, which has already integrated the technology to several vehicles, including the Jaguar F-PACE and Range Rover Velar.  Software architect Russell Vickers said:  “In the future an autonomous car could drive itself to a charging station, recharge and pay, while its owner could choose to participate in the sharing economy – earning rewards from sharing useful data such as warning other cars of traffic jams.”  Back in 2017, Jaguar Land Rover-backed blockchain startup DOVU was also planning to launch a blockchain platform to reward users for sharing mobility data such as location, distance traveled and weather conditions.

42381794,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9pajR,1556517633,Bond Rating Agency Moody's Warns on Risks of Private Blockchains,"Rating agency Moody's has warned of several risks of private, centralized blockchains in a report for clients examining the pros and cons of the technology for financial firms.  Titled ""Blockchain Improves Operational Efficiency for Securitizations, Amid New Risks,"" the April 25 report describes the basic features and promises of blockchain technology, explaining how businesses like banks can leverage it to their benefit.  In the document, seen by CoinDesk, Moody's emphasizes the difference in security between private and public blockchains, saying that consensus mechanisms in private chains may not be as strong as those seen in public chains, or may be absent altogether.  It continues:  ""Private/centralised blockchains are more exposed to fraud risk because system design and administration remains concentrated with one or few parties.""  ""Sound blockchain governance is key for risk management,"" the report continues. In this case, private blockchains, where the governance and responsibility structure is clearer, win in Moody's view. In addition, while a decentralized system makes data recovery and auditing easier, it increases ""the number of gateways for attacks,"" the report says.  Trusting the 'unknown other'  New kinds of risks are in fact posed by blockchain, Moody's argues. The tech ""replaces trust in the 'known other' (other humans, institutions, intermediaries) with trust in the 'unknown other' (code, entities and dynamics that are hard to see and understand from the outside).""  However, Moody's report also discusses blockchain's potential to bring benefits to a number of industries. For example, the use of smart contracts could streamline the creation and management of securities. Although, as the technology hasn't reached maturity yet, ""applications, in the near-term, will remain experimental, limited to pilot phases with a small number of participants and/or parallel processing with conventional technologies,"" the authors write.  Another promising use case is loan issuance. Putting loan information on a blockchain, along with the data of loan-backed securities, will make the communication between these parts on a bank's business faster and more straightforward, with information updating and changing automatically.  ""The securitization blockchain can rely on data provided by the lending blockchain, subject to (automated) checks and controls,"" according to the report.  It also outlines some of the productive work that has already been done in the blockchain field. The report notes that some EU nations have already started to work with blockchain land registries and concludes:  ""Without blockchain based land registers, efficiency gains on the asset side of a mortgage backed securitization transaction will remain limited.""  Code is law?  The report also touches on the possibility of using smart contracts as legally binding agreements in the future.  This future, if real, is still far away, the authors believe.  ""A full replacement of natural language contracts by computer code is unlikely, because of a lack of flexibility with regards to the scripting language. Furthermore, parties to a smart contract should consider governance and control mechanisms to ensure that modifications to the original contract can be made at a later stage without greater difficulties,"" they write.  Moody's has been monitoring blockchain technology for several years now.  Back in 2016, the company revealed that the governments and companies it had been rating were working on as many as 120 various blockchain-related projects. And last April, the firm published a report saying that the tech could help the U.S. mortgage industry cut up to $1 billion in expenses.

42381799,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9papj,1556510402,"A Glimpse of Banking’s Future, Live on the Ethereum Blockchain","Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk’s advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.      At first glance, this week’s move by the investment bank Societe Generale to issue a security token-like bond in which it was both the issuer and the sole investor might seem like a pointless act. Not so much a peer-to-peer transaction; just a peer transaction.  But one element of the announcement suggests this was actually an important step in financial institutions’ sometimes fractious relationship with cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. You see, Societe Generale’s $112 million bond issue used smart contracts built not a private, permissioned blockchain but on the public, permissionless ethereum blockchain.  This was a baby step, for sure. But, let’s remember that this French bank belongs to an industry whose member institutions repeatedly posit that permissionless blockchains are unworkable for them.  Banks have made various arguments for why they feel compelled to use private, permissioned versions of this technology: because they are beholden to know-your-customer and other compliance rules that aren’t easily enforced in a permissionless environment; because their competitive interests require a level of privacy that can’t be assured in a transparent, public setting; or because public blockchain’s probability-based standard for confirming trade settlement falls short of what Wall Street’s lawyers call “settlement finality.”  Yet here was the 19th-largest bank in the world experimenting with the public model.  It would be way too premature to say that Societe Generale has discounted those industry concerns about permissionless blockchains – concerns that are more likely founded on fears of the threat to existing business models than anything else. But the French bank’s move could also signal an acknowledgment that banks’ can’t afford to turn their back on the disruptive threats and opportunities posed by permissionless protocols such as bitcoin or ethereum.  Societe Generale appears to be placing a side bet that the future evolution of digital finance will play out much as the battle for supremacy in next-generation communications technology did in the 1990s – lest it be left on the wrong side of history.  A bet that open systems win  At the end of the nineties, it had become clear that the public, open, interoperable Internet had beaten out private, closed, walled-garden Intranets such as Prodigy, AOL and France’s Minitel to define the new architecture for worldwide information-sharing. It has since become accepted wisdom that the Internet’s open, global system proved superior because it imposed no limit on network size or on the breadth of potential connectivity and because “permissionless innovation” enabled a global developer talent pool of unlimited size and collective brainpower.  It’s reasonable to assume, though by no means guaranteed, that history will repeat itself with the struggle over the future of financial systems. Yes, the unique sensitivities and regulatory framework surrounding finance creates a substantial barrier to entry that protects incumbent institution, those for whom closed, walled-garden approaches protect their competitive positions.  But at the end of the day, money is just information. Communities will tend toward free and open systems for using it.  Is that what Societe Generale is betting on? Perhaps. While the deal was an entirely in-house affair, the bank did make the bond’s terms pari passu with its other covered bonds, a category of debt that securitized by specific balance sheet assets. That means that future owners, whoever they may be, would have equal ranking and risk exposure as any investors in Societe Generale’s more conventional bond issues. And with a five-year maturity, there is ample time for the bank to take the more radical step of seeking outside buyers in a secondary market sale once it has a blessing from regulators.  Also important was the fact that rating agency Moody’s said it considers the use of blockchain technology “credit positive” in this case, in part because of increased transparency and a reduced likelihood of errors “arising from the complexity and the number of intermediaries involved in issuing covered bonds using traditional means.”  This positive assessment points to the generalized potential of security token offerings, or STOs, as a way to more efficiently issue, manage and trade traditional assets such as stocks, bonds, real estate and commodities.  Disruption to come  STOs aren’t as radical an idea as Initial Coin Offerings, or ICOs, which have fallen out of favor with investors following the collapse of the crypto-token market last year and as regulators have threatened actions against the many that have the characteristics of unregistered securities.  Whereas ICO issuers sought to avoid securities registration requirements by describing their “utility tokens” as an integral, commodity-like component of the decentralized networks they were building – a product, not a speculative investment -- STOs are simpler and more straightforward. They represent a tokenized claim on some form of real-world asset, and they are deliberately intended to be treated as a security for compliance purposes.  Nonetheless, STOs still promise to be extremely disruptive to capital markets, with a big impact on investment banks such as Societe Generale.  STO-serving smart contracts could allow for automatic updates of share registries and cap tables with each trade, and enable more direct exchanges between buyers and sellers, with fewer intermediaries. Also, if it’s a permissionless system – if there are no “permissioned” incumbent financial entities functioning as gatekeepers of a private blockchain – there is nothing to stop startup service providers shifting many traditional back-end activities such as underwriting, custody and brokerage over to a decentralized network. These are services that investment banks, for the most part, currently provide.  All of this requires that the tech be sufficiently scalable, of course, and that regulators are happy with the kinds of cryptography-based custodial solutions on which it depends. However, it’s widely believed, by people in both crypto and traditional finance communities, that we will get there.  Seeking to control the process  What’s impressive about Societe Generale’s implicit position, then, is that it seeking to understand and have some control over a technology that will inherently threaten some of its businesses.  In doing so, it may be betting that banks like it will adjust to the new paradigm much as they did in the nineties when online stock trading and electronic marketplaces initially threatened Wall Street’s dominance of the securities industry.  Those systems, which made market prices more transparent, drastically reduced the commissions that investment banks could charge for trading, but they also promoted a surge in volumes that compensated for the tighter margins. In the end, the savviest banks invested in this new trading and matching technology and, in taking charge of its development, managed to retain a dominant position in capital markets.  The death of banks might well be a thing to celebrate in the future. But the reality is that the market will for some time continue to value much of the expertise and market-making power that currently resides on Wall Street, even as it starts to demand that the functional back-end tasks of record-keeping, custody, trade matching and clearing and settlement be handled by smart contracts, digital currencies and distributed networks.  Corporate issuers of STOs will always need to find investors. They’ll also be keen to offload the risk that those investors won’t be found onto someone who’s willing and able to bear it. And they’ll pay a good price for those services. My guess is that this is where banks will continue to be very active.  Those that are out there, experimenting with the most radical, future-facing versions of blockchain and other disruptive technologies will be the most profitable in doing so.
