42426048,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhzZh,1410214865,Marco Santori Joins Blockchain Team as Global Policy Counsel,"Blockchain announced today that it has retained New York business attorney and commercial litigator Marco Santori as its global policy counsel.  Santori, who recently also joined the firm Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman, told The Wall Street Journal that Blockchain “espouses the values that bitcoin is meant to advance”, and that such values helped motivate his decision to work more formally with the company.  The move can also be seen an indication of bitcoin’s maturing regulatory environment.  Blockchain  CEO Nic Cary told CoinDesk that many regulators are beginning to thoughtfully analyze bitcoin as well as the various business models of bitcoin companies. He also said that clear leaders have emerged in the legal field, and these experts are now doing very specialized work in the digital currency space.  He added:  “Marco represents the best of the industry, in terms of success, but just as importantly, Marco is committed to a vision of a consumer friendly, safe and decentralized future.”  Blockchain offers a popular bitcoin wallet and block explorer service, and has popular bitcoin developer and lecturer Andreas Antonopoulos as an advisor to its board.  An educational mission  For Santori’s part, he told CoinDesk the move was motivated by two things: the synergy and values of Blockchain and Pillsbury Winthrop, and his mission to educate those who want to learn about bitcoin.  “I think Blockchain is really poised to continue its explosive growth from its experience over the last couple of years,” he said.  Speaking of the traditional payments team at Pillsbury Winthrop, he added: “I like to think that when our powers combine we’ll have the best bitcoin regulatory team in the country.”  Santori pointed out that not all bitcoin companies have the same vision or take the same path, and that he is keen to continue on the one he’s taken with Blockchain, “helping close the knowledge gap”.  He said:  “One of Blockchain’s missions is going to be helping educate regulators on how Blockchain works differently than other wallet providers […] It’s really going to be an educational mission more than anything.”  Community influence  Santori is a leading figure on bitcoin law in the US and is a proponent of maintaining a dialogue regarding digital currency regulation and policy  In particular, Santori has been influential in many US regulatory cases – particularly those out of New York this year. He gave written testimony opposing the proposed New York State BitLicense at the January hearings overseen by New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) superintendent Benjamin Lawsky.  Santori is also the chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation’s Regulatory Affairs Committee – a role he’ll keep when he takes on his new position – and author of CoinDesk’s series on bitcoin law.

42426055,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhzhh,1410204315,Payments Processor Braintree Confirms Bitcoin Integration Rumors,"Following weeks of rumors, Braintree has announced that it will soon enable customers to accept bitcoin.  Braintree  , a subsidiary of eBay-owned PayPal that was acquired for $800m in 2013, revealed on its blog that it intends to release a software development kit (SDK) that developers and merchants can use to add bitcoin to their existing payment methods.  The integration is the result of a partnership with Coinbase, which was first reported to be in talks with Braintree about a potential partnership this August. Further, the news was officially announced at TechCrunch Disrupt San Francisco during a talk given by Braintree CEO Bill Ready.  Ready told TechCrunch:  “This is PayPal making a move to embrace bitcoin.""  The official announcement also followed a teaser video that caused a stir in the bitcoin community today issued by PayPal itself and suggesting that Braintree's parent company may move to accept bitcoin.  Coinbase indicated that developers at Coinbase and Braintree will be working together closely over the next few months to complete the integration. No formal timeline for the official launch date was given.  Early access  In its blog post regarding the announcement, Coinbase indicated that Braintree businesses will need to open a new merchant account with Coinbase in order to complete the integration upon its release.  However, Braintree merchants that want to get in early on the opportunity can move to contact Coinbase now through a dedicated email address. Further, Coinbase indicated that it will also disseminate future news relating to the launch through this mailing list.  As previously noted, the mobile payments processor supports thousands of high-tech startups, including notable brand names such as Airbnb, Dropbox, Hail-O, Hotel Tonight, LivingSocial, OpenTable, TaskRabbit and Uber and more.

42426045,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhzRh,1410199513,PayPal Video Sparks Rumors About Potential Bitcoin Plans,"PayPal has sparked speculation in the wider digital currency community with the release of a new promotional video that makes reference to bitcoin.  The video, titled ‘PayPal Voices’, was published on the company’s official YouTube page today.  The one-minute promo features a string of actors who are described as “the voices of the people economy”, extolling the benefits of using PayPal. Bitcoin is mentioned just 10 seconds into the video in the following voiceover passage:  ""Our phone is our wallet. We can spend bitcoin with a tap, without a pocket.""  The news provides the latest evidence that either the eBay-owned company or its mobile payment processing subsidiary Braintree might move to integrate bitcoin into an upcoming project.  First reported by The Wall Street Journal this August, such speculation was given yet another boost today in an article by Re/code that suggested Braintree's announcement may come as soon as today.  Braintree was acquired by PayPal in September 2013. PayPal itself is a subsidiary of eBay, one of the largest e-commerce companies on the web. Outspoken bitcoin advocate Marc Andreessen sits on the board of eBay.  Speculation mounts  At the time of writing, PayPal’s only reference to bitcoin integration is the excerpt from the video.  Still, speculation has run rampant, with more than 400 comments about the video splattered across YouTube and reddit.  Notable bitcoin investor and SecondMarket executive chairman Barry Silbert has joined in discussing the significance of the video:    Looks like @PayPal is launching bitcoin integration: https://t.co/eMBXipgyw7 ""We can spend Bitcoin with a tap"" (h/t @TuurDemeester)      — Barry Silbert (@barrysilbert) September 8, 2014      More information needed  Details are still sparse, and even if the video is proven to be authentic, it’s not entirely clear what plans PayPal has for the digital currency.  While the video does not necessarily mean that PayPal will integrate with bitcoin, the timing of both Re/code's news and the video raises many questions.  The bitcoin community has been vocal about the relationship between PayPal and bitcoin in the past. Many argue that the digital nature of bitcoin lends itself perfectly to PayPal’s business model, while others contend that bitcoin doesn’t need the support of a centralized platform to flourish.  Whatever the case may be, a PayPal-bitcoin integration would certainly shake up the industry and bring the digital currency significantly more visibility with the general public.  CoinDesk is continuing to follow this developing story. At press time, neither PayPal nor Braintree had responded to requests for comment.

42426109,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhzXh,1410193699,Mobile Payments Pioneer: I'm Betting on Bitcoin For Emerging Markets,"For mobile payments pioneer and venture capitalist Carol Realini, the financial world is divided into three camps: those who believe in bitcoin, those who don't understand it and those have yet to consider or study its technology.  Realini identifies firmly as a bitcoin believer, though she's not surprised many of her peers don't share her sentiment.  After all, the former CEO of Obopay – a mobile payments application provider that raised more than $140m, but whose profile declined amid increased interest in mobile wallets – has a blazed a unique trail in the world of payments. This has found her maintaining a focus on financial inclusion, even as the various technologies that could best help her to work toward this goal have changed.  For Realini, it's her decade of experience striving to empower consumers in emerging markets that she believes allows her to see the full potential of what bitcoin – both its community and its underlying payment platform – could help achieve for global finance more clearly.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Realini framed bitcoin as a way for global innovators to sidestep many of the longstanding issues with legacy payment systems, systems she believes have been unsuccessful in emerging markets due to a fundamental weaknesses in technology.  Realini told CoinDesk:  ""If you think about bitcoin in emerging markets, it's creating a leapfrog opportunity. It's open, it's modern, it's innovative and it isn't bogged down with all the legacy stuff that supports a minority of the people in these societies.""  Realini isn't just theorizing about this potential reality, however. She's also made it clear she wants to support the bitcoin ecosystem.  Of the 100 companies she estimates she's worked with this year, she's made an angel investment in only one, emerging market-focused bitcoin services provider BitX, joining the company's S$1m ($824,000) seed funding round this August.  Legacy systems fall short  Throughout the interview, Realini drew on her expertise in emerging markets, providing a unique perspective gleaned most recently through her book, co-authored with serial entrepreneur and PlaySpan founder Karl Mehta, Financial Inclusion at the Bottom of the Pyramid.  Emerging markets, Realini asserted, are being underserved by traditional financial players due to their inability to grasp the true challenge of the market. She pointed out, that in most of the developing world, ATMs aren't found on every street corner and debit cards aren't found in every wallet.  Mobile phones, she explained, offered financial innovators a new path forward in the 2000s, but, even then, the technology wasn't enough. What happens when innovators have tried to harness the power of mobile phones to attack financial problems, she believes, is that legacy banking systems still form a serious obstacle.  Realini said:  ""When you move to mobile, you start to hit up against these infrastructure issues and that these bank products and services are super inflexible and in most cases they don't fit the needs of the mass markets. They don't fit the needs and functionality and they're complicated in most cases – that's just the reality of emerging markets.""  Fulfilling the vision of mobile  Realini went on to suggest bitcoin could realize the broader vision of early mobile payments entrepreneurs, creating a better platform for the next-generation financial products needed throughout much of the world.  In particular, she cited the fact that many financial products that are commonplace in the developing world, simply will not translate successfully to emerging markets:  ""You can just take a Bank of America checking account, introduce it and have it be successful, it just won't work.""  For example, she cited statistics that suggest that while the average consumer uses a debit card 18 times a month in developed countries, in India this figure falls to just over one time each year. That figure is confirmed by research from the Reserve Bank of India, and provides evidence of Realini's assertion that financial incumbents are falling short on providing essential financial tools to much of the world.  Realini said:  ""If you look at the banks, they're trying to change this, but the legacy technology and the legacy business is holding them back. They're moving at a banana slug's space.""  The 'myth' of M-Pesa  She also tackled another oft-cited argument in the traditional payments world: that legacy payments can successfully innovate in emerging markets, as evidenced by successful platforms such as Kenya's popular mobile money platform M-Pesa.  Launched in 2007, the payment service is now used by more than 17 million Kenyans to transfer cash with their mobile phones in what has been widely viewed as the predominant success story in the global mobile payments space.  Still, Realini sees M-Pesa as an anomaly that not only isn't likely to be replicated, but that could be outpaced by bitcoin-based solutions. The platform's major weaknesses, she said, are that it is controlled by only one vendor and that it has yet to offer solutions for the business-to-business (B2B) and merchant markets.  Bitcoin's open platform as more capable of delivering this full range of financial products, she said, adding:  ""I'm betting that the bitcoin community will have a better platform. The basic architecture is better and [it has a] more vibrant and open community.""  More broadly, Realini sees M-Pesa as failing to fully deliver on the promise of financial inclusion:  ""I want everybody in the world to have access to all the financial products they need to empower their life and work and M-Pesa was a massive success, but it did not accomplish that. They've got work to do. I would just bet on an open collaborative community versus a one-vendor closed community.""  Community over currency  In Realini's view, bitcoin's real strength is its open payments platform and its community, not necessarily its underlying currency. Realini expects that bitcoin will be used as a currency by some, but be more powerful for its application in new financial products.  Unlike banks, which she categorized as slow to innovate, bitcoin as a community could move to more quickly provide elegant solutions to emerging markets. These solutions, she suggested, are likely to originate in the bitcoin community before being embraced by banks.  Realini said:  ""[Bitcoin] is different in that it's a better platform to solve hard problems. If there's any disadvantage in the platform, the community is there and they're making it better every day.""  What bitcoin needs now, Realini said, is entrepreneurs who can identify specific challenges in select markets.  Scarcity of bitcoin startups  Realini further stated her belief that venture capitalists are beginning to see this same future for bitcoin, but that there will be challenges in the short-term that impede progress. For example, she noted that VCs are having difficulty finding the right startups for their portfolios.  Realini cited her long path to joining BitX's latest funding round as evidence of this, saying:  ""I've met a lot of bitcoin companies, a lot of very smart people, but [BitX] were the ones that were super smart and had enough experience. They weren't so experienced that they were clouded by their experience, but they had just enough that they could build on the experience they had.""  Ultimately, Realini's overwhelming perception was that the BitX team had both an existing platform and long-term market strategy that could be successful, and that the opportunity was just too big for her to pass up.  ""I said I don't want to sit here. I know these guys are going to be successful, I'm going on the board [of directors], but I don't want to miss the opportunity to put real dollars in,"" she said.  Further, this enthusiasm has led her to make bold predictions about bitcoin and its potential in emerging markets:  ""I think we're going to see bitcoin play a significant role in being the platform for coming up with next-generation banking solutions that are going to serve emerging markets.""  Carol Realini will host a live Twitter chat on 9th September from 12:00pm to 12:30pm EST that will address both the short and long-term outlook for bitcoin, as well as its potential for promoting financial inclusion around the globe.

42426057,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhzph,1410184963,OKPay 'Ordered' to Hand Over Customers' $6.1 Million to Mt Gox,"Payment processing firm OKPay has defended its recent transfer of withheld deposits totalling almost $6.1m to Mt Gox, saying a court order compelled it to make the payments.  The $6,014,910 amount consisted of deposits from individual OKPay customers around the world to Mt Gox in the period immediately preceding the exchange's collapse.  Until mid-August, the funds had existed in limbo in a Mt Gox-owned account and OKPay had intended to return everything to customers.  OKPay CEO Konstantin Romanovsky told CoinDesk that was no longer possible after a court decision in the British Virgin Islands (where OKPay is registered) ordered that the amount legally belonged to Mt Gox.  ""Initially, we fought for the right to return the money directly to customers, but Mt Gox forbade us to do so. We reached the court, which eventually ordered us to pay the money [into the] Mt Gox Trustee Fund, and not to send money back to customers. As a result, we have fulfilled the court's decision in the BVI and recently sent money [...] We understand that for our business' overall image it would be better if we could send money back to them... But we had no other choice, and the decision of the court is already an undeniable factor.""  Romanovsky also refuted a separate rumor that OKPay itself would be closing down, blaming poor translations of original articles. ""This is complete nonsense,"" he said.  Earlier assurances  According to customers writing on the Bitcoin Talk forum, OKPay had originally said any funds left un-sent to Mt Gox would be returned to depositors.  They posted the following earlier message from OKPay Support:    ""We want to assure you that your recent payments are on the internal MtGox account in the OKPay System, and, if the MtGox company cease to exist without fulfilling its obligations to customers, we will send your recent payments back to your OKPay account; so your funds will not be lost or stuck without any reason when we receive a confirmed report on the situation.      ""We will appeal to MtGox to address this issue and keep you abreast of the situation. We will do everything possible to ensure that our clients either receive the service they paid for or get their money back to the OKPay account."" [sic]    Although several customers expressed a willingness to take legal action against OKPay, others explained such an attempt would be pointless given the payment took place under a court order.  Creditors must wait  CoinDesk reached out to the Mt Gox bankruptcy trustee's office for comment, but had not received a reply at the time of publication.  While no official reason has been given for the BVI litigation, the trustee would likely consider the extra funds property of Mt Gox to be returned to creditors in some form at the case's conclusion.  Mt Gox creditors  , however, have expressed displeasure at fees the bankrupt exchange has paid since its February 2014 demise, including $200,000 to parent company Tibanne, also owned by CEO Mark Karpeles.  OKPay's bitcoin headaches  OKPay had suspended transactions involving bitcoin exchanges including Mt Gox as early as May 2013. At the time, Mt Gox was still the world's most popular bitcoin trading platform with a 70% market share, but had suffered setbacks including cancelled transactions by payment processor Dwolla in May 2013 and a brief suspension of trading in April 2013 for a ""market cooldown"".  OKPay explained that its banking partners were ""not comfortable with bitcoin and want payments to these firms restricted"". It later reviewed that decision, and currently processes payments to and from a number of different bitcoin exchanges.

42426040,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhzLh,1410181545,Dutch Campaign Aims to See Bitcoin Classified as Money,"Bitcoin company Bitonic has launched a crowdfunded campaign to support efforts to define bitcoin as money in the Netherlands.  The campaign has been dubbed Bitcoin is Geld (literally: 'bitcoin is money') and has so far raised more than 30 BTC. The cause enjoys the support of the Dutch Bitcoin Foundation and law firm SOLV.  Bitcoin is Geld will use the funds to promote legislation beneficial to bitcoin users in the Netherlands, effectively defining bitcoin as money in the country.  The campaign website indicates that the campaign was formed after a Dutch judge stated that bitcoin is not considered 'real' money and it now plans to take ""the judge's statement to a higher court by giving reasons as to why bitcoin should be defined as money"".  It states:  “Labelling bitcoin as a medium of exchange instead of money could have a big impact on individuals and companies who are engaged with this virtual currency. With this campaign, Bitonic and the community examines the question as to what could be expected if bitcoin, by law, would be treated the same as money.”  Highlighting pros and cons  The first goal is to raise a minimum of €15,000-worth of bitcoin, with Holland-based Bitonic contributing around a third of that total (10 BTC and €2,500), which will go towards hiring lawyers to spearhead the campaign. If fundraising goes well, other experts will also be taken on board.  The campaign aims to highlight the differences between treating bitcoin as a medium of exchange and treating it as money, which has far-reaching implications for taxation and estate law, as well as anti-money laundering (AML) provisions. As a result, the campaign argues, the regulatory framework should be changed.  “The aim is to point out [the] conclusion that civil law will become more efficient and organized when bitcoin and money are equated. In order to continue this campaign, [the] appeal needs to be funded, by integrating crowdfunding they are hoping to accomplish this goal,” the website states.  Bitconic executive Daan Kleiman explains:  ""The current interpretation needs to be changed and improved and this is the reason why we are bringing the case to a higher court. In the first stage, the law firm SOLV will provide the judge with arguments as to why the current interpretation needs to be improved. This first step is the most important one since it requires the judge to reconsider the previously made statements and will hopefully change the current laws and regulations in order to prevent mistakes in future bitcoin-related cases.""  Kleiman argues a victory for bitcoin in the Netherlands would benefit other jurisdictions as well.  ""Our campaign has currently been funded for 90+% in a very short time period. We still have more than 50 days to go so we have a very positive outlook towards our goal and are convinced that we will hit the target,"" he told CoinDesk.  Calls for community discussion  The Bitcoin is Geld campaign already has its share of critics in the country's cryptocurrency community, though.  One of them is local bitcoin activist and investor Paul Buitink, who shared his views in a video discussion last week (Dutch language), along with fellow critic Martijn Wismeijer and Bitonic’s Pieterjan Goppel and Daan Kleiman.  Buitink later told CoinDesk that he does want bitcoin to be treated like fiat currencies or forex, as that is the only way of making it a truly successful means of exchange. He argues that more relaxed regulation would benefit startups and small companies rather than stifle innovation in the block-chain space.  However, he is not convinced that the campaign is the right way forward:  “With regards to the initiative, I think Bitonic needs to halt it and first have a good and honest discussion with the Dutch bitcoin community that clearly isn't supporting this to the extent they hoped. The Dutch Bitcoin Foundation, Stichting Bitcoin Nederland, should become more transparent and explain how they're funded and involved with this.”  Crowdfunding image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/09/08/dutch-campaign-aims-to-see-bitcoin-classified-as-money,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/14bd0775cbdf518b2722c06876705c458b4aa0ae-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42426022,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhv9h,1410169295,'Record Attendance' for India Seminar Reveals Keen Interest in Bitcoin,"Bitcoin in India is showing plenty of promise at the grassroots level, as demonstrated by 250 undergraduate students who attended a seminar at the HR College of Commerce and Economics in Mumbai last Thursday.  Those present already demonstrated a basic knowledge of bitcoin and some of its technical aspects such as block chain transparency and mining, according to Vishal Gupta of the Bitcoin Alliance of India, who headed the presentation.  Gupta told CoinDesk he was impressed at the level of interest, saying:  ""College faculty informed me that it was the highest attendance recorded for any visiting guest [to] date as it was an optional class and there was no compulsion on any student to attend the class.""  Topics and questions of interest  The seminar covered both the history and future of money in an almost two-hour session, of which one hour was devoted to questions and answers.  ""We ourselves were surprised with the kind of questions students asked,"" said Gupta, explaining that most of the students must have read about bitcoin on the Internet, since there is still not much information on bitcoin publicly available in India. The Bitcoin Alliance of India's website, he said, typically receives about 150 visitors per day.  They also questioned the speaker about the reasons for Mt Gox's failure, the transparency of transactions on the block chain and predictions for a future when the bitcoin system reduced or stopped payouts to miners.  Gupta said that, after this initial success, he plans to take the student seminar initiative to other colleges in Mumbai. One of India's premier educational institutions, St Xavier's College, has already requested a bitcoin lecture of its own.  Student attendees' views  Helping to organize the event was Raunaq Vaisoha, a finance student who told CoinDesk he had been monitoring bitcoin's progress since 2012, after coming across it on YouTube. He originally saw it as a volatile investment option but, he said, ""I later discovered the multitude of opportunities that it enables otherwise and have been hooked ever since"".  He is currently involved with at least five bitcoin-related startups.  ""As is evident from our recent conference in HR College which saw the likes of over 250 people, I am not alone in my interest towards bitcoin. I believe that if well publicised, bitcoin could reach unprecedented heights in India.""  Another participant, student Pulkit Bornani, reported that although he had never used bitcoin previously and had been unsure about it, he now couldn't wait to get started.  Bitcoin's properties gave it some unique advantages in his home country, he wrote.  ""I really see a future for bitcoins in India where people in villages cannot get to a bank easily and microfinance is somewhat of a taboo. Bitcoin might just be the answer.""  Hurdles facing bitcoin acceptance  The Bitcoin Alliance of India, like similar advocacy groups around the world, is committed to the task of spreading bitcoin awareness – though it still faces some hurdles in its home country with both communication and regulation.  Gupta said privately arranged bitcoin trades remained more popular than exchange-based trades, while many of the popular online options are still limited in their ability to process deposits and withdrawals via banks.  All bitcoin exchanges need to be registered with the government and deposits cleared through the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), the same as commodity and stock exchanges.  Future plans for digital currencies  The country's various bitcoin groups and businesses have previously held discussions over the possible formation of a chapter of the Bitcoin Foundation in India, and have also worked on a formal white paper to present to the Indian government.  Gupta said he and Vaisoha were also working to open a 'bitcoin cafe' in India, to demonstrate digital currency use in an everyday retail setting. Furthermore, Gupta is also involved with more advanced projects to develop the digital ecosystem in the future.
