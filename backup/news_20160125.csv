42378570,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7ibzD,1453752026,European Parliament Holds Hearing on Digital Currency Regulation,"A European Parliament committee held a public hearing on virtual currencies today in Brussels at which it discussed the possibility of regulating digital currencies following the recent Paris terrorist attacks.  The hearing  of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) was a preparatory measure for the agency's forthcoming report on virtual currencies. Topics discussed included the risks and challenges posed by publicly traded virtual currencies, as well as the impact of blockchain and distributed ledger technology on which virtual currencies are based.  Panellists included representatives from the European Commission and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) as well as academics and stakeholders from the private sector.  In his opening remarks, German MEP and committee member Jakob von Weizsäckerm was keen to reiterate the goal of the meeting and potential implications of its decision-making as governments look to get tougher on terrorist financing.  Von Weizsäckerm said:  ""We are considering in the follow-up of the terrible Paris attacks whether there might be a need to regulate virtual currencies. It has been considered in the past and we are certainly looking at options in the wake of the terrorist attacks.""  However, he noted that he believes the technology should not be overregulated while it is evolving, as he recognises that there are potential advantages offered by the technology.  Thaer Sabri, regulatory adviser and CEO of the Electronic Money Association, who overall recommended a light regulatory touch, also brought up the subject of the Paris attacks in his address, saying: ""We mustn’t let the pendulum swing too far.""  ""As far as financial crime is concerned, industry agrees regulation is a desirable thing,"" Sabri added. ""If we don’t disuade criminals from using these products. the products could become disreputable.""  Offering a counter argument, Jeremy Millar, a partner at financial technology consultants Magister Advisors, said that, since it is already illegal to fund terrorists, detection is key, not regulation.  Siân Jones, founder of the European Digital Currency and Blockchain Technology Forum and advisor to COINsult, further explained that the use of virtual currencies in money laundering has been ""grossly overstated"", and that the ability to easily trace past transactions renders them unsuitable for such activities.  ECON is the European Parliament committee responsible for economic and monetary union, the regulation of financial services, the free movement of capital and payments, taxation and competition policies and the international financial system.  Light touch needed  In the wide ranging discussion, there was a general mood that the virtual currency and blockchain industry should not be overly regulated for fear of stifling the new and potentially advantageous technology.  Primavera De Filippi, a research fellow at Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University, said that bitcoin networks can be constructed to be ""agnostic of any jurisdiction"" and that people can operate the network without disclosing their identity.  ""This provides opportunites for criminal activity, tax evasion and money laundering,"" she said. The challenge is regulating virtual currencies ""without infringing on the consumer benefits in terms of innovation and regulatory compliance.""  Addressing bitcoin regulation, Millar argued that the industry is, to an extent, already self-regulating.  He give his opinion that the overwhelming majority of bitcoin transactions are carried out through a small number of companies, such as miners, exchanges and wallet platforms. Furthermore, most services are built on these platforms.  Since the industry has already largely become institutionalised, he suggested, building relationships with these companies would be more effective than new rules.  Illustrating how the bitcoin industry can effectively manage itself, Millar told the committee that, following the recent block size debate, key players in the industry had come together within just a few days to discuss a solution.  He said:  ""We’ve seen the bitcoin ecosystem come together to work collaboratively to solve the problems it faces.""  Monitor not regulate  Von Weizsäckerm said, in his conclusion, that regulators have a tendency to apply what he termed ""precautionary"" regulation, and that it is a challenge to keep an open mind in new areas like virtual currencies.  Instead he proposed generally ""precautionary monitoring"" so regulators can keep abreast of developments in the industry.  Von Weizsäckerm said:  ""I would feel more comfortable if we were in a situation where exponential growth usages of blockchain were ... at least understood by regulators before they become very big.""  In financial areas, he explained, if the business model is not understood by regulators then there is a greater risk of, for example, Ponzi schemes arising, and ""that is the kind of thing we don't want to discover when it's too late"".

42378568,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7ibwh,1453745873,DTCC Report Cautions Against Building Blockchain Hype,"Trade settlement giant DTCC has released a new report that recommends industry stakeholders experiment with blockchain implementations while cautioning against the growing hype surrounding the technology.  DTCC released its report more than a month after the firm announced its participation in an effort led by the Linux Foundation to develop an open-source blockchain initiative called the Open Ledger Project.  The report, entitled ""Embracing Disruption: Tapping the Potential of Distributed Ledgers to Improve the Post-Trade Landscape"", offers a tempered endorsement of the technology and identifies several aspects that could be applied to the post-trade environment.  The authors of the report state:  ""There are several key features that make this technology a potentially attractive option to improve existing processes, including the fact that standard rules exist for securities transaction validation and replication; immutable linkage to transaction history and auditability.""  Yet, the report goes on to state that further work is needed before the financial services industry should move to adopt it.  Steps recommended include the development of industry standards and an analysis of whether the benefits of changing post-trade systems to utilize blockchain technology outweigh the costs.  ""In addition, the industry itself needs to determine whether using the platform is more cost effective than improving existing technology and whether it can overcome its inherent scale and performance challenges,"" the report states.  Despite the questions, DTCC suggests that a number of market mechanics could be augmented or replaced with the technology, including securities issuance, settlement and servicing; collateral management; netting and clearing; and data management.  Notably, its report, DTCC raised the question of whether an industry push toward real-time trade settlement necessarily requires the use of a blockchain. Firms like Overstock, with its tø platform, are currently pushing for the adoption of blockchain technology as a mechanism for securities trade and issuance.  DTCC also raises questions about the degree to which the blockchain is being hyped – a situation it says puts the trade settlement industry in a position of repeating past mistakes when it comes to experimenting with and potentially adopting new technology.  ""As a result, the industry is at risk of repeating the past and creating countless new siloed solutions based on different standards and with significant reconciliation challenges – essentially a new system with the same challenges we face today,"" the report states.

42378567,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7ibvR,1453742171,Digital Asset Holdings Details Work on Hyperledger Blockchain Platform,"Digital Asset Holdings has released new details about its long-secretive Hyperledger blockchain platform.  The information follows last month's announcement that the code was to be moved to, and developed in collaboration with, the Linux Foundation, and comes just days after Digital Asset raised more than $50m from 13 financial incumbents.  A number of major companies have already made commitments to what has been called the Linux Foundation's Open Ledger Project, including IBM, JP Morgan and Wells Fargo. At the time, Digital Asset was unique among them, however, as its contributions were to go beyond code in that it would provide the brand ""Hyperledger"", which it acquired in 2015, for use by the effort.  Less clear were the technical specifics of Digital Asset's approach to blockchain technology.  Founded in 2014, the startup has long categorized itself as a software provider that leverages ""distributed infrastructure"" to deliver ""asset settlement"" services to customers, terminology that didn't offer much insight into its work beyond identifying its target market.  However, a statement released from Digital Asset last Friday further details the technical side of the project, which it described as a ""enterprise-ready blockchain server with a client API"".  The release continued:  ""Hyperledger employs an append-only log of financial transactions designed to be replicated at multiple organizations without centralized control.""  Digital Asset's writing suggests Hyperledger will be positioned as a ""data backbone"" that coordinates data across a client's services and a low-level ""communication and consensus layer"", one that will aim to upgrade the global financial infrastructure.  ""The goal of Hyperledger is to allow expansion of the data backbone concept to the multi-organization level,"" it continued, adding:  ""We are open sourcing this project with the belief that as a critical part of the new financial infrastructure, this part of the software stack should be commoditized, collaborative and serve as the robust backbone to value-added applications.""  Emphasis on scalability  The release did much to relay the message that Digital Asset views its technology as a complement to the current transaction systems in place at major financial institutions.  ""Hyperledger was built with the requirements of enterprise architecture in mind by a team that has worked in financial institutions for decades. It has a highly modular design at both the code and runtime levels to allow for integrations with legacy systems,"" the release noted.  It went on to state that Hyperledger's networking rules would be configurable ""to allow for distinct interoperable consensus groups, each with its own functional and nonfunctional requirements"".  Digital Asset indicated the technology is its ""latest stable version"" of the code, which will now be reviewed by the Linux Foundation’s Hyperledger project and its Technical Steering Committee.  It further promised a number of forthcoming improvements, which would include some features released as part of Blockstream's Elements project, which was aimed at increasing functionality on the bitcoin blockchain.  Stance on bitcoin  Notable was Digital Asset's admission that it would draw on concepts from the open-source bitcoin blockchain, a subject its CEO Blyth Masters has been relatively quiet on in her many public appearances.  ""Hyperledger utilizes the same UTXO/script-based transactional decision of bitcoin and extends it with features required in financial services,"" the startup wrote.  The release goes on to state that while it does not believe bitcoin is ""suitable for many uses within regulated financial infrastructure"", it offers valuable insight into how blockchains should be secured.  ""Much of its design and mature cryptography has been withstanding attacks in the wild, protecting tokens with a market cap in the billions of dollars,"" Digital Asset wrote, adding:  ""By conforming to the UTXO model as a de facto standard there is a larger ecosystem of innovation to draw from.""  The statements provides insight into how so-called private or permissioned ledger companies are evaluating the bitcoin network as they seek to build alternative systems.  Byzantine fault tolerance  Digital Asset also confirmed it would be utilizing a consensus system that offered an alternative to proof-of-work mining. The process, pioneered in bitcoin, uses a decentralized network of computers to secure the bitcoin blockchain and process transactions.  Digital Asset said Hyperledger includes a ""prototype implementation"" of the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance consensus module, which would serve as an alternative to the mining process.  ""We are collaborating with many of the other members of the project on the consensus module to ensure there is a scalable, secure, Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus protocol that can provide settlement finality for wholesale financial institutions,"" the release said.  The concept has been in development since the original Hyperledger team began to develop its blockchain system in 2014, and appears to still be undergoing evaluation.

42378563,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7ibrf,1453716400,Bitcoin and the Politics of Non-Political Money,"An early trope about bitcoin was that it was ‘non-political’ money. That’s a tantalizing notion, given the ugliness of politics. But a monetary system is a social system, technology is people, and open-source software development requires intensive collaboration – particularly around a protocol with strong network effects.  When the group is large enough and the subject matter important enough, human relations become politics. I think that is true even when it’s not governmental (read: coercive) power at stake.  Bitcoin’s politics burst into public consciousness last week with the “whiny ragequit” of developer Mike Hearn. In a Medium post published ahead of a New York Times article on his disillusionment and departure from the bitcoin scene, Mike said bitcoin has “failed,” and he discussed some of the reasons he thinks that.  As do most people responding to the news, I like Mike and I think he’s right to be frustrated. But he’s not right on the merits of bitcoin, and his exit says more about one smart, impatient man than it does about this fascinating protocol.  But there is much to discover about how governance of a project like bitcoin will proceed so that politics (in the derogatory sense) can be minimized. Stable governance will help bitcoin compete with governmental monetary and record-keeping systems. Chaotic governance will retard it. We just need to figure out what “stable governance” is.  Growing animosity  If you’re just tuning in, usage of bitcoin has been steadily rising, to over 150,000 transactions per day. That is arguably putting pressure on the capacity of the network to process transactions. (And it undercuts thin, opportunistic arguments that bitcoin is dead.)  Anticipating that growth, last May developer Gavin Andresen began pushing for an expansion of the network’s capacity through an increase in the size of “blocks,” or pages on the bitcoin global public ledger. The current limit, 1MB about every 10 minutes, supports about three transactions per second.  Eleven months earlier, Gavin had stepped down as bitcoin’s lead developer to focus on broader issues. He handed the reins of 'Bitcoin Core' to a group that – it later became clear – doesn’t share his vision. And over the summer and fall last year, the arguments in the block-size debate grew stronger and more intense.  In August, Gavin and Mike introduced a competing version of the bitcoin software called Bitcoin XT, which, among other things, would increase the block size to 8MB. Their fork of the software included a built-in 75% super-majority vote for adoption, which made it fun to discuss as “A Bitcoin Constitutional Amendment.”  This move catalysed discussion, to be sure, but also deepened animosity in some quarters. Notably, the controller(s) of various fora for discussing bitcoin on the web began censoring discussion of XT on the premise that this alternative was no longer bitcoin. Nodes running XT were DDoSed (that is, attacked by floods of data coming from compromised computers), assumedly by defenders of Core.  Seeking resolution  A pair of conferences entitled “Scaling Bitcoin” brought developers together to address the issues, and the conferences did a lot of good things, but they did not resolve the block-size debate. The bitcoin community is in full politics mode and the worst of politics are on display.  Well, actually, not the worst. Politics is at its worst when the winners can force all others to use their protocol or ban open discussion of competing ideas entirely.  Competing ideas. Competing software. To my mind, these seem to be the formative solution to bitcoin’s current governance challenge. The relatively small bitcoin community had fallen into the habit of using a small number of websites to interact. Those sites betrayed the open ethos of the community, which prompted competing alternatives to spring up.  The community has likewise fallen into the habit of relying on a small number of developers – of necessity, in part, because bitcoin coding talent is so rare. Now, though set back by the censorship and DDOS attacks, Bitcoin XT is joined by Bitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin Classic as competitors to Bitcoin Core.  The developers of each version of the bitcoin software must convince the community that their version is the best. That’s hard to do. And it’s supposed to be hard. Competition is great for everybody but the competitors.  The coin of the realm in these competitions–as in all debates–is credibility. Each software team must share the full sweep of their vision, and how their software advances the vision. They must convince the community of users that they have thought through the many technical threats to bitcoin’s success.  I’ll confess that the Core team’s vision remains relatively opaque to me. I gather that they weight mining centralization as a greater concern than others do and thus resist the centralizing influence of a larger block size.  As a technical layman, the best articulation for Core I’ve found is a response to Mike Hearn from BitFury’s Valery Vavilov. In it, one can at least see the reflection of the vision. Core’s recent statement and a December discussion of capacity increases don’t overcome the need for more sense of where they see bitcoin going and why it’s good.  Need for credibility  I’m certain that they intend the best, and I’m pretty sure they feel that they’ve already explained their plans until they’re blue in the face. (Or, at least, blue in the hair…) But the community might benefit from more, and Peter R’s presentation in Montreal – though needlessly peppery at the end – is the clearest and thus most plausible explanation of block-size economics I’ve found. (Much in this paragraph may be evidence of my ignorance.)  The reason Mike Hearn could ragequit is because he no longer wants a place in the bitcoin community. He set a match to all his political capital.  Everyone else in the bitcoin community, and especially the developers, must do everything they can to build their political capital. They must explain the merits of their ideas and – in the fairest possible terms – the demerits of others. They should back up their ideas with supportive evidence, which, happily, an open technical system allows.  And they should turn away “allies” who censor discussion forums or sponsor DDoS attacks. They should avoid impugning the motives of others, and, when they lose, lose gracefully.  All these behaviors cultivate credibility and the ability to persuade over the long haul. They offer the prospect of long-term success in the bitcoin world and success for the bitcoin ecosystem. Good behavior is good “politics,” which is something this non-political money needs.
