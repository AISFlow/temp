25586660,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=602762,1712876426,DAI Circulation Approaches 5 Billion As MakerDAO Unleashes Key Updates,"In a recent announcement on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), MakerDAO, the Ethereum-based protocol responsible for issuing the DAI algorithmic stablecoin, provided insights into the performance of the Maker Protocol following recent changes. Over the past few weeks, MakerDAO has implemented significant updates to the protocol and the DAI stablecoin. Introducing the Accelerated Proposal and the direct deposit module (D3M) to Spark’s Metamorpho Vault has notably impacted the ecosystem. Increased DAI Supply And Demand Looking at key metrics that demonstrate the effects of these changes to the protocol, the DAI supply in circulation currently stands at nearly 5 billion, reflecting a growth of approximately 300 million over the past month. This growth indicates continued demand for the stablecoin. Related Reading: XRP Sees An Alarming 1,800% Surge In Liquidations, Whats Going On? On the other hand, the Dai Savings Rate has significantly increased since implementing the Accelerated Proposal. Approximately 1.54 billion DAI are currently deposited in the Dai Savings Rate, of which approximately 976 million DAI are sDAI, representing an increase of roughly 400 million DAI in deposits. The Maker Protocol’s total value locked (TVL) amounts to approximately $8.4 billion across various vault types. This TVL growth can be attributed to strategic deployments in D3M modules, significant contributions from Ethereum-based collaterals, and the integration of real-world assets. These developments have enhanced the protocol’s diversification and resilience. MakerDAO Ethereum Vaults Thrive A notable addition to the MakerDAO ecosystem is the Morpho DM3, which enables the Morpho Vault to mint DAI. Currently, the lending pool has deployed 200 million DAI. According to the protocol’s post, this allocation is projected to generate approximately 50 million in annual income for the Maker Protocol, making it the second-largest core vault in terms of annualized fees. It will play a significant role in generating revenue and contributing to the Maker Protocol’s sustainability. Among the Ethereum vault types within the MakerDAO ecosystem, the ETH-C vault stands out with the largest value locked in crypto collateral at approximately $1.88 billion. This vault generates approximately $43 million in annual fees, underscoring its importance within the Maker ecosystem and contribution to the protocol’s revenue streams. Related Reading: Cardano At Risk Of Crashing To $0.4 As Important Metrics Turn Bearish Another important component is the Spark D3M, which is supplied with around 970 million DAI. This module is projected to generate an annual income of approximately 28 million. These recent changes have positively impacted the Maker Protocol. The increase in DAI supply, growth in the Dai Savings Rate, expansion of collaterals, and introduction of different vault types have contributed to the protocol’s growth and development. Despite the growth in the MakerDAO ecosystem, the native token MKR has experienced a continuous 5.9% price decline over the past fourteen days. In the last seven days alone, the token has recorded a significant 17% price drop, resulting in its current trading price of $3,355. However, despite the price decline, Token Terminal data reveals positive trends. The protocol’s market capitalization currently stands at $3.3 billion, reflecting a notable 28% increase over the past 30 days. Additionally, trading volume for the MKR token has experienced a substantial surge, reaching $5.9 billion, representing a 119% increase over the same time frame.

42418407,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTgxXp,1712874887,Top U.S. House Lawmakers Meet on Stablecoin Bill Strategy: Punchbowl,"The U.S. congressional effort to establish regulations for stablecoins has become an increasing longshot for passage this year, but the lawmakers who've pushed legislation the farthest reportedly had a meeting with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer about it, Punchbowl News reported.  House Financial Services Committee Chairman Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) and the panel's senior Democrat, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), met with Schumer on Thursday to get legislation moving, potentially tying it to reauthorization of Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) funding, the site reported.  On the crypto event circuit, McHenry has repeatedly contended that it's still possible to get his panel's stablecoin bill passed for President Joe Biden to sign it into law, including in remarks earlier this week. McHenry is retiring from Congress this year and has put a priority on the legislation to provide guardrails to issuers of the tokens that, among other uses, provide a steadier foundation for the trading of more volatile cryptocurrencies.  Read More: Key Congressman McHenry Is Bullish U.S. Stablecoin Law Will Pass This Year  Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), who has also been trying to move digital assets legislation, said last month that Schumer was willing to work on a stablecoin bill.  Despite its success in passing the House committee with a bipartisan vote, the legislation faces daunting hurdles. It could be difficult to get a floor vote in a House that has been virtually paralyzed by infighting – especially within the ranks of top Republicans. And the Senate Banking Committee has shown no interest in picking the idea up and matching it. That could leave the narrower option of engaging in esoteric legislative wrangling to get it attached to a must-move item, such as the FAA spending bill.  Spokespeople for McHenry and Waters didn't immediately respond to requests for comment on the meeting.  Crypto insiders in D.C. have been quietly lamenting it as a likely lost cause for this session, but the Schumer meeting and McHenry's optimism may keep hope alive.",NEUTRAL,없음,REGULATION | TRADING,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/04/11/top-us-house-lawmakers-meet-on-stablecoin-bill-strategy-punchbowl,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8d4482da19142b0c5152e2c60a45771584ff7950-4030x2267.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The company has decreased its headcount by 10% as it faces challenges in growing the topline. Insiders have sold a significant amount of their holdings, and the company's shares are trading at a significant premium to the value of their Bitcoin holdings. MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) is currently undergoing a major shift in their core business objectives as the firm migrates from software licensing to subscription-based services. The firm has recently launched a new BI/AI customizable chatbot tool that is said to assist with customers’ business intelligence needs. As MicroStrategy is transforming their foundation, challenges may be afoot as the firm decreased their headcount by 10% on the back of consistently declining revenue. Net of the firm’s Bitcoin holdings, I believe that the organization is struggling with growth and may see further challenges in the near future. In addition to these risks, insiders have sold a tremendous amount of their holdings on top of the firm’s ATM equity sales. From a value perspective, MSTR shares are trading at 1.98x the value of their Bitcoin holdings as of April 10, 2024, pricing shares at a premium to Bitcoin spot ETNs. Given these factors, I rate MSTR shares a SELL with a price target of $790/share at 1x the value of their Bitcoin. Operations MicroStrategy is currently in the process of reinventing its core business intelligence business as they transition customers from software licensing to their cloud, subscription-based services. MicroStrategy’s software is currently offered across all major hyperscalers, including Azure, AWS, and now GCP. Subscription-based services accounted for 16% of revenue for FY23 as management seeks to transition more customers to their cloud offerings. Given the nature of MicroStrategy’s broader business plan of acquiring Bitcoin, this should allow for more visibility into future revenue generation, as deferred revenue will be known for the period. One fundamental challenge I see in MicroStrategy’s legacy business is their focus on business intelligence while attempting to pair it with artificial intelligence. Though the two uses of data are relatively synonymous, I believe that the firm may not have the competitive edge for AI-related applications as their larger, more advanced software platform competitors like Palantir ( PLTR ). For the most part, MicroStrategy’s AI capabilities are appealing to firms that are seeking to develop a customized, internal chatbot. Though I cannot speak on the cost comparison for customers when considering competing AI-related platforms, I do believe that this is a nascent approach to facilitating revenue generation to fuel the firm’s Bitcoin purchases. My rationale behind this is that the firm cut 10% of their headcount in sales & marketing and R&D in the last year in an attempt to bolster margins. This strategy did work to the firm’s benefit as their adjusted gross margin improved from -$1,212mm in FY22 to -$46mm in FY23. Though this can be seen as a significant improvement, I believe it will potentially pose a challenge to the firm’s forward growth trajectory in this transitory phase. The firm has already been faced with declining revenue generation; it declined by -6% in q4’23 and -1% for the full year. I believe some of this is in part due to the transition from selling software licenses to subscription sales, in which this is typically anticipated; however, the firm’s revenue has been in a decline for the last decade. Seeking Alpha I do believe that the firm is more so positioning itself to act as a leveraged Bitcoin holding company with their legacy BI business as a continued project. It has been made clear that the primary objective of any capital raises, whether through operations or the capital markets, is primarily diverted to Bitcoin holdings. As of their q4’23 release, the firm holds 190,000 Bitcoins on the balance sheet, up from 132,500 from the year prior. There are a few details in the business’s operations that draw my attention. One aspect about this operation that draws my attention is that the firm raised $1.2b in equity sales to purchase more Bitcoins in q4’23, most of which were diverted to MacroStrategy, a separate holding entity for their Bitcoin holdings. I believe the sole purpose of this subsidiary is to both hold Bitcoin and shield the firm’s Bitcoin holdings from any financial hardships if they were to arise. Given that the solvency of the firm’s operations now depends on the value of Bitcoin, I believe that if Bitcoin were to fall under their aggregate acquisition price for an elongated period of time, which is less plausible since Bitcoin spot ETNs entered the market, the firm may enter a period of financial hardship given their declining revenue stream. Another factor that raises concern is Michael Saylor’s stock sale in MSTR shares in the last few days starting April 8, 2024. On April 8, 2024 , Mr. Saylor sold 5,000 shares for proceeds of $7.6mm. The following day on April 10, 2024 , Mr. Saylor sold an additional 4,006 shares for proceeds of $5.7mm for a total sum of just over $13mm. I believe Mr. Saylor is being opportunistic in his stock sales, as shares have reached their all-time high in recent years. In the last year alone , Mr. Saylor has sold 285,000 shares of MSTR stock. Given the company’s drive to bolster their position in Bitcoin holdings through equity and debt raises, I believe his stock sales are counterintuitive to his overall strategy. Mr. Saylor is not alone, as insiders have made 120 MSTR sales transactions in the last year with no share purchases made. Financials Corporate Reports My investment thesis for MSTR shares is relatively aligned with my thesis on Bitcoin mining firms like Marathon Digital Holdings ( MARA ) and CleanSpark ( CLSK ) in which holding these firms as a proxy for holding Bitcoin is no longer necessary with the launch of Bitcoin spot ETNs. I believe that with the launch of these ETNs, these firms should be valued based on operational excellence as opposed to their Bitcoin holdings given that the firm adds an extra layer of operational risk. Valuation & Shareholder Value Corporate Reports From a valuation perspective, I believe MSTR shares have surpassed their reasonable valuation at 53.55x trailing sales. I believe that the firm will face a continuation in declining sales going forward, resulting in further downside risk to the share's value. Corporate Reports Given the access to Bitcoin ETNs, I believe it is prudent to also do a comparison for their Bitcoin holdings. Considering MSTR as a proxy for Bitcoin holdings, the firm’s shares trade at 1.98x the value of Bitcoin as of April 10, 2024. The price array above begins at the firm’s aggregate acquisition price of Bitcoin and follows through $80k/btc. If shares were to trade 1:1 with Bitcoin, shares should be priced at $790.45/share, a -50% downside risk potential. Corporate Reports I believe that given the various tacked-on risks to MicroStrategy’s business when compared to holding Bitcoin spot ETNs, I believe that MSTR shares are significantly overvalued. I provide MSTR shares a SELL recommendation with a price target of $790/share at 1x BV of Bitcoin.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4683369-microstrategy-operational-decline-cannot-be-salvaged-by-bitcoin?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/25584597.jpeg

Bitcoin Net Taker Volume Has Seen Some Large Negative Spikes Recently As explained by CryptoQuant Netherlands community manager Maartunn in a post on X, selling spikes of a significantly heavier scale than before have recently appeared in the Bitcoin Net Taker Volume. Related Reading: Bitcoin 2 Months Through “Euphoria Wave,” How Long Was The Last One? The “Net Taker Volume” is an indicator that keeps track of the difference between the Bitcoin taker buy and taker sell volumes in perpetual swaps. How can the sell and buy volumes be different? As CryptoQuant explains in its data guide: This concept is often confusing because every trade requires both a buyer and a seller of the given underlying asset. However, depending on whether the order taker is a buyer or seller (whether a transaction occurs at the ask price or the bid price), you can distinguish between long volume from taker seller volume. When the value of this metric is positive, it means that the taker buy volume is overwhelming the taker sell volume right now. Such a trend implies a bullish sentiment is shared by the majority. On the other hand, the negative indicator suggests that more sellers are willing to sell the coin at a lower price, a sign that a bearish mentality is the dominant one. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Net Taker Volume over the past year: The value of the metric seems to have been quite red in recent days | Source: @JA_Maartun on X As the above graph shows, the Bitcoin Net Taker Volume has recently registered a sharp negative spike, implying that the taker sell volume has been higher than the taker buy volume. The Net Taker Volume has been seeing some large red spikes for a while, as the analyst highlighted in the chart. “Bitcoin is being hammered down massively, with selling spikes on the Net Taker Volume significantly heavier than before,” says Maartunn. Interestingly, despite this bearish sentiment in the market, the Bitcoin price has managed to hold up relatively well. Obviously, the coin’s bullish momentum has gone while these negative Net Taker Volume spikes have taken hold, but the fact that BTC has shown strength against any sustained drawdowns is still impressive. Related Reading: Dogecoin Slows Down: What Needs To Happen For New DOGE Highs? A pattern that’s perhaps visible in the chart is that although the Net Taker Volume has continued to see red spikes recently, their scale has gradually decreased. Thus, if this trend continues, it’s possible that the bearish mentality will eventually run out, and buying pressure will take over Bitcoin. It now remains to be seen how the indicator develops shortly. BTC Price Bitcoin declined below $68,000 just yesterday, but today, the asset has already bounced back and is now trading around $70,800.

The growth in ETF supply is largely driven by cheap fees and the reality that Bitcoin is expensive to use by comparison. Longing BITB is a way to get both capital appreciation from gains in BTC while also indirectly funding non-profit Bitcoin development. We're officially three months into the existence of spot Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) ETFs in the United States market. With approximately a week remaining until Bitcoin's next block reward halving, I think it's worth taking a bird's eye view of how Bitcoin is actually being adopted so far in 2024. In this post, we'll look at US ETF flows, the state of the Lightning Network, and why Bitcoiners may want to consider the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF ( BITB ). Bitcoin vs Gold ETF Flows From an asset under management standpoint, I don't think there can be much debate that these products have been an enormous success so far for in bringing BTC exposure to the broader investment community: BTC ETF Cumulative Net Flow (The Block) Even when adjusting for the 49% BTC-denominated AUM puke from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ) since ETF conversion, the cumulative net flow of BTC into US-based spot ETFs is over 220k BTC. At a $71k Bitcoin price, the net flow of assets under management represented by these funds is almost $16 billion. This contrasts with Gold ( XAUUSD:CUR ) ETFs which have seen roughly 113 tonnes come out of the investment products since the start of the year: Global Gold ETF Flow vs Gold Price (World Gold Council) There has been an understandable conflation among some in the Bitcoin community that Bitcoin ETF inflow has somehow come at the expense of Gold ETF outflow. In my view, this relationship has been exaggerated and I spent some time dissecting what I believe is really happening in a recent article for Seeking Alpha covering the Sprott Physical Gold Trust ( PHYS ). Specifically, Gold started leaving ETFs shortly following US/EU financial sanctions on Russia as foreign central banks have begun to minimize their exposure to the US debt debacle. Coupled with the idea that there are more claims on Gold than can actually physically be delivered, it shouldn't be a surprise that the price of Gold is doing what it's doing. This is what I said on my personal blog in early April: There are 7.5 billion ounces of Gold above ground . When Gold was $2,000/oz way back in February , the value of all the yellow metal was $15 trillion. As of market close today, Gold’s above ground market capitalization is just under $17.5 trillion. Bitcoin’s market cap is a little over $1.3 trillion. Meaning Gold just grew by about two Bitcoin market caps in a matter of a few weeks. This, I think, provides context on the magnitude of what is happening right now. And while it's exciting to see the ""number go up"" gains in Bitcoin from all of this positive BTC net flow over the last 3 months, I do think it's worth pointing out that BTC wasn't designed for this kind of ""adoption."" And the long-promised scaling the network on L2s has simply not lived up to the hype. Lightning Network For as much promise as the Lightning Network seemed to have, I don't think we can realistically say it has accomplished what many within the community have hoped it would - myself included . While I'm not on Nostr, I have used a few applications that utilize Lightning on the back end. In my personal opinion, the UE is still not great. And frankly, high base layer fees challenge the utility of Lightning because the scaling layer still requires opening and closing channels on Bitcoin. Furthermore, batching transactions that cost virtually nothing isn't a profitable endeavor when base layer fees get high. Lightning Capacity (LookIntoBitcoin) But don't even take my own opinion for it, capacity growth on Lightning measured in BTC peaked 9 months ago. Despite Lightning Network being in development for years, there's literally more BTC on Arbitrum ( ARB-USD ) via Wrapped Bitcoin ( WBTC-USD ) than on Lightning. Nodes have been dropping as well and that trend actually peaked two full years ago: Lightning Nodes (LookIntoBitcoin) Each of these metrics were rising leading up to the last halving in 2020 and that's simply not the case this time around. Between Lightning, Liquid, and Merlin - each of which are considered ""L2"" networks - we get a total of approximately 35k BTC on Bitcoin scaling networks. This is obviously dwarfed by the 220k BTC that has flowed to US-based ETFs. Ultimately, it's all about the fees and it just isn't cost effective to have small amounts of Bitcoin on the base layer any longer. Address breakout (IntoTheBlock) Consider this: on April 10th, the average Bitcoin transaction fee was $9. At that number, about 34% of the 51.5 million non-zero balance addresses don't have enough BTC to pay to move it. That is a significant problem for a network that was originally designed for peer to peer transactions and it explains the narrative pivot to ""store of value"" during and following the block size war. It also clearly shows the fundamental issue with onboarding to Lightning; it's not economical for the kind of users who benefit from L2s to actually get to them from the primary layer. All of this is not meant to dunk on Bitcoin or its more diehard supporters. I'm still very much rooting for the success of Bitcoin personally and maintain quite a bit of exposure to the coin. But in my view we have to look at these networks without blinders on and accept that Travis Kling's assessment of this industry may not be all that far off at this point in time. The good news is it doesn't have to be this way. Funding Development via Bitwise's Bitcoin ETF The scaling issues that the Bitcoin network currently has can be addressed. In my view, real on-chain adoption through usage can only further strengthen the value proposition of the network. The Bitwise Bitcoin ETF is one of two ETFs that currently plans to fund Bitcoin development through the fees that the ETF holders pay the company. Per Bitwise's press release announcing this intention: The donations have no strings attached and will be made annually for at least the next 10 years. For BITB holders, 10% of Bitwise's profits have been committed to funding three different non-profit developers. Those recipients are Brink, OpenSats, and Human Rights Foundation. Initially, Bitwise waived the BITB management fee for either 6 months or $1 billion in AUM: Data by YCharts As the fund is now well ahead of that $1 billion AUM figure, the expense ratio for BITB shares is 0.20% and BITB holders are now indirectly funding non-profit Bitcoin development. In addition to funding development, 0.2% is one of the most competitive rates in the market. Data by YCharts BITB does occasionally trade at a small premium to net asset value and that's another potential factor to consider. Though it's far from the only fund that is currently trading slightly above the BTC value underlying the shares. Risks Digital assets are not tangible. In my view, there's a reason why real Gold is flowing out of ETFs while ""digital gold"" is flowing into them. That said, there is a tremendous amount of faith, energy, and hardware backing Bitcoin that I think is going to be exceedingly difficult to break. In the world of public blockchain networks, Bitcoin is by far the most decentralized network and thus carries an element of ""safety"" that many of the other blockchain networks likely lack. However, that perception of safety could certainly change as US regulators and government actors appear to be getting more aggressive in fighting this industry. And that brings us to the real reason so many still swear by Bitcoin despite its flaws. Summary Ultimately, Bitcoin remains largely an anti-fiat trade. And despite there being an enormous amount of competition in the anti-fiat realm both in and out of crypto, BTC and its many proxies are probably still the fastest horses in that race. If one can accept holding Bitcoin with no less than three layers of intermediaries, than BITB might be one of the more principled options in the market as the company will be funding non-profit developers not named Blockstream. The halving event is an important reminder that the network is secured by entities that require incentives to continue securing that network. At a certain point, miner revenue from transactions is going to have to become a more meaningful portion of total revenue for these operators. I would argue transaction share growth due only to a shrinking total reward pie is the wrong way to incentivize that security. Problems for the future, perhaps. For now, ""number go up"" and ""dollar down"" are still good enough reasons to hoard coins in 2024 in my view.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4683367-bitwise-bitcoin-etf-the-principled-approach-to-custody?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/25584260.jpeg

The net inflows into ETFs may not be a true reflection of Wall Street's sentiment as some of it may be due to traders needing a marginable long BTC position while shorting other assets. Other factors, such as pairs trades and basis trades, may also contribute to the inflows, suggesting that not all of the BTC bought is a result of bullish investors. This doesn't really impact the long run tailwinds for Bitcoin. This is a short article which takes a careful look at the mainstream narrative that Bitcoin ETFs signal institutional adoption, and that Wall Street is increasingly bullish on Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). It's been three months since the spot ETFs were approved, and we’ve seen a good amount of activity from these funds. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) has been called the most successful ETF launch in history by Larry Fink. There were prominent headlines when IBIT surpassed MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) in the amount of BTC held. The sentiment within crypto circles seems to be that Wall Street is entering the game and that things are only going up from here. I just want to do a quick reality check on whether Wall Street is actually as bullish on BTC as people are saying. Based on what I have seen, I don’t think the ETF net inflows indicate Wall Street is bullish at all. We need to consider the net inflows because Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ) has seen a huge amount of outflows. Here Are The Numbers Right before the approval of the spot ETFs, GBTC had about $29 billion in AUM. The BTC price on January 8 2024 was about $47,000. This means GBTC held about 617,000 BTC. GBTC AUM (YCharts) As of April 10 2024, the combined Bitcoin ETFs hold 838,729 BTC. Let’s round this number to 839,000 BTC. Bitcoin ETFs (heyapollo.com) So we started with only GBTC’s 617,000 BTC and now there are 839,000 BTC in all the funds, so it looks like Wall Street is super bullish right? Investors clearly bought up a net 222,000 BTC during this time - more than 1% of the entire maximum supply of 21 million BTC, and just slightly higher than MicroStrategy’s total BTC holdings. This is used by those in crypto to show that there is “insatiable demand” for BTC from Wall Street, and that ETFs are literally “eating multiples of the daily issuance of BTC.” Not so fast. Kerrisdale recently published a “ short report ” on MicroStrategy. Even though it was called a short report by the media, it was actually outlining a simple pairs trade between MSTR and BTC. Their thesis is that MSTR has become overvalued compared to the BTC it holds, trading at an unsustainably high premium, so it is time for a long BTC, short MSTR pairs trade. Now I think it should be quite obvious that Kerrisdale, or any other hedge fund making this bet, will use a Bitcoin Spot ETF as the “long BTC” leg of this pairs trade. ETFs are marginable securities, whereas real BTC cannot be margined in a brokerage account. It is much more capital efficient for a trader to use the ETFs and manage the risk within a single account. Even today when brokers offer crypto, they are actually enlisting the help of other firms which specialize in custodying and transacting crypto. The spot ETFs are the best option, and I believe many hedge funds may be betting on this trade, so they are inherently long BTC via the ETFs. Importantly, these longs are not long because they are bullish on BTC. They are long only to capture a spread between MSTR and BTC. Such traders do not have any interest in BTC, yet they will nevertheless show up as ETF inflows. In other words, at least some of the 222,000 BTC inflow is due to traders needing a marginable long BTC position while shorting MSTR. How much dollars might be betting on this? Well, the short interest on MSTR is about 19% of outstanding shares. Let’s assume some of these are unhedged shorts and others have to do with the convertible debt issuance. I also think that some hedge funds will do this long/short but use MSTR options for the short position. This is effectively a “synthetic short” position which won’t show up on the short interest. They could sell a call and buy a put. Indeed, the puts to call ratio for open interest has been approaching 1, indicating that roughly the same amount of contracts exist for both puts and calls. MSTR Puts/Calls OI (Schwab) Assuming much of the short interest is betting on this pairs trade, and assuming that derivatives are used for some of the MSTR shorts (thus obfuscating and understating the true amount of short positions), I'm guessing maybe 20% of the shares outstanding in notional short value in this pairs trade exists - as a combination of options and shares sold short. Personally I think 20% is a conservative figure. There’s more. The market cap of MSTR is $26.3 billion and they hold 214,246 BTC, worth about $14.8 billion. So the premium over owned BTC is about 78%. So to get a dollar-equivalent MSTR/BTC pairs trade, you'd need to be long about 1.78x as much BTC as what the MSTR shares you are shorting is supposed to represent. For example, 100 MSTR shares represent 1.26 BTC held by MicroStrategy. But 100 MSTR shares is worth about 2.24 BTC, so to actually establish a dollar-equivalent pairs trade where you short 100 MSTR shares and are long the same dollar amount as a hedge, you need to be long 2.24 BTC, or whatever that value is in your chosen Bitcoin ETF. So if 20% of the shares outstanding in notional value is short, then about 20% x 1.78 x 214,246 = 76,271 BTC is needed for the long leg of the pairs trade. That would mean 76,271 BTC of the 222,000 net inflow of BTC is actually not bullish on BTC. But that’s not all. Let me direct your attention to the Commitment of Traders (COT) report regarding the Bitcoin futures trading on the CME (/BTC, where each contract is 5 BTC of notional value). The recent COT report reveals about a net 16,000 contracts short on the behalf of ""leveraged traders."" Again, it is likely there is a pairs trade going on. More specifically, this is what is called a “basis trade.” You see, /BTC futures have been trading at a sizable premium to the BTC spot price. The “basis” is the technical term for this premium. The basis can be captured by going long in the spot market and going short in the futures market. Right now, with the June futures priced at $71,400 and the spot price at $69,500, the basis is an annualized return of 16%. And this is a pretty much guaranteed return as it only relies on the CME remaining solvent. BTC Futures (CME) So 16,000 short contracts represent 80,000 BTC, which again will be purchased via the marginable spot ETFs. These will look like inflows, but they do not represent bullishness in BTC itself. So in total, MSTR and the /BTC futures are probably responsible for 156,000 BTC of inflows which are not indicators of bullishness. To complete this analysis, we need to look at the outflow which was not a sign of bearishness nor was it a sign of wanting to switch from GBTC to an ETF with a cheaper fee. The main culprit here is Genesis, which has sold a lot of GBTC shares to redeem about 32,000 BTC for its creditors. This is an outflow from the ETFs which should be added back in to the net inflow figure. So all in all we have: 156,000 BTC inflow from pairs and basis trade 32,000 BTC outflow which was forced from Genesis 222,000 net inflow into ETFs when we just consider the delta between what GBTC had pre-approval to what the ETFs hold in total right now 222 - 156 + 32 = 98, so only 98,000 BTC were bought by bullish BTC investors. I would like to add that this is probably an overestimate too. There could be a lot more than just 20% of MSTR shares in notional short value. The actual short interest was 19% and there could be a lot more shorting from derivatives than what I have assumed here. Also, MSTR isn’t the only Bitcoin equity which could be involved in a long/short strategy. Some Bitcoin miners may be in some trouble after the Halving. Miners are very leveraged and most have bad margins. These could also be pairs trade candidates. That would mean even more non-bullish inflows. Lastly, I also don’t know how many are only bullish in the short-term, like in the form of a momentum trade. The narrative that Wall Street is eating up BTC with an insatiable hunger is, to me, a very dangerous form of confirmation bias which could lead to crazy, unrealistic projections. Should You Be Bullish On Bitcoin? I am 100% allocated to BTC or BTC-adjacent positions (including the ETFs and MSTR in my Roth). I think you should be bullish, but not because you think Wall Street grabbed 222,000 BTC in just 3 months after launching the ETFs. The Halving is coming up and there are many macro catalysts. I think global liquidity is surely to rise, and this has been very helpful for BTC. I covered developing catalysts for this crypto bull cycle which could make this bull run extremely Bitcoin-centric in this article . I also believe there is a lot to be said about Bitcoin mining becoming an integral part of energy grid infrastructure. People will start to realize that BTC was one of the best ESG assets after all, since it does so much for renewable energy and communities in developing nations . Bitcoin is surely here to stay. Wall Street might not be bullish per this analysis, but the ETFs have undoubtedly opened the floodgates to vast pools of capital, although I believe these pools haven’t yet begun to enter in any sizable volume. Did you know that this is the first time in Bitcoin’s history that it broke previous all-time highs before the Halving? There is definitely some bullishness under the surface.

25581805,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=602698,1712869220,Crypto Analyst Predicts Shiba Inu Price Will Reach $0.0001 If This Happens,"A crypto analyst has raised the possibility of Shiba Inu (SHIB) rising to as high as $0.0001. As part of his analysis, he highlighted certain factors that could contribute to the meme coin experiencing this parabolic price surge. Shiba Inu To Rise To $0.0001 If History Repeats Itself Crypto analyst Bunchhieng suggested in his analysis that SHIB could attain such a price level if history were to repeat itself, and SHIB mirrors its bullish pattern from the 2021 bull run. He affirmed that based on the patterns that he observed from the previous bull market, it was “quite possible” for SHIB to hit $0.0001. Related Reading: Crypto Experts Predict Massive Price Surge For XRP Price, Is $20 Possible? Source: Tradingview.com The analyst also tried to clear the doubts of those who believe that such a price surge isn’t likely considering SHIB’s market cap, stating that anything was possible in the crypto world. Meanwhile, he added the SHIB burn rate, which has continued to increase exponentially, as another factor that could have a “positive effect” on the meme coin’s value. Bunchhieng’s price prediction also looks feasible when one considers crypto analyst Rekt Capital’s recent analysis, in which he suggested that SHIB was already mirroring its price action from 2021. Back then, he revealed that SHIB, similar to 2021, had successfully retested the $0.000026041 price as a new support level. In a more recent update, Rekt Capital also suggested that SHIB was showing enough strength to make a similar run to the one in 2021, stating that SHIB’s current support level served as resistance for the meme coin in early 2022. SHIB Could Indeed Hit $0.0001 Bunchhieng isn’t the only crypto analyst who believes that SHIB can hit $0.0001. Crypto analyst Javon Marks also predicted that the meme coin could rise to $0.0001553 once it hits the $0.000081 price range. Interestingly, these aren’t even the most bullish predictions for Shiba Inu. Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin Halving Influence Is No Longer Driving Price, Here’s What Is Crypto analyst Armando Pantoja, who recently outlined his price targets for different crypto tokens, predicted that the meme coin could rise to $0.001 after the Bitcoin Halving. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Ali Martinez predicted that SHIB could rise to $0.011, although he didn’t give a specific timeline for when this unprecedented price surge will occur. Despite the varying price predictions, it is, however, clear that SHIB is more than likely to hit a new all-time high (ATH) in this bull run. Pseudonymous crypto analyst and trader Xanrox believes this could happen as soon as July, predicting that the crypto token would rise to $0.00008854 by then.

APT declined more than 16% over the past week while major crypto assets bitcoin {{BTC}} and ether {{ETH}} gained 3% and 5%, respectively.

Some $141 million worth of tokens will be distributed to core contributors, $100 million to investors, $38 million among community members. $16 million in tokens are earmarked for the ecosystem development foundation.

Since then, Solana’s core contributors have been working to find the congestion problems. SOL’s price tumbled 7.8%, and users seemed worried about the network’s state. Despite this, some analysts predict a more optimistic performance for SOL soon. Related Reading: Paradigm Drives $225M Funding Round For Monad Labs, Blockchain Rival To Ethereum, Solana Is Solana Poised For A Bounce? According to crypto analyst Bluntz, Solana’s drop has reached its bottom. When the news of network congestion broke, the analyst predicted that SOL’s price would likely fall to $160 before seeing a bounce. According to his chart, the performance was starting to show an ABC zig-zag pattern. At the time, the token was trading around the $184 price range, which meant that the C wave of $160 had yet to be confirmed. The analyst remained open to the “possibility of a sideways correction.” Nonetheless, he considered it “would make no sense for sol/usd to sweep down lower below 160.” On Wednesday, SOL reached a low of $162, sweeping the “A wave low.” To the analyst, this seems to be the bottom for SOL’s price despite being $2 short of his prediction. As a result, Bluntz considers that the token’s price will go “higher from here.” ABC pattern on the SOL monthly chart. Source: Bluntz Another analyst, Immortal Crypto, pointed out that SOL has shown a “good range” between $210 and $160. According to the analyst, “a deviation from here is a fat long, 100%.” Despite the possible bounce forecast, analyst Altcoin Sherpa expects SOL to drop to $140, a level it has not seen in almost a month. Will The Network Upgrade Help SOL? In the last 24 hours, Solana’s price has risen 6%, recovering from the drop to the $162 range. Despite a 7.8% drop in the past week, the price surged 13.5% in the last 30 days. Similarly, the daily trading volume increased by 28% in the past 24 hours, suggesting a surge in the token’s market activity. Nonetheless, investors remain concerned about the network as the problems continue, with some suggesting that the token’s price won’t start pumping until the “tech is sorted out.” Solana is widely recognized for its fast transactions and low fees. However, the current on-chain failure rate presents problems for both users and developers. Responding to the critics and concerns, Austin Federa, Head of Strategy at the Solana Foundation, gave insights into the problem.

42418419,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTgxjB,1712863639,"Willem Schroé: Building Botanix, a Bitcoin Layer 2 That Brings the EVM to Bitcoin","When Willem Schroé was 17, he came in third out of 10,000 in a national math competition in Belgium, his home country. His prize was a book on botanics, the study of mathematics and fractals in nature. The book inspired awe in him, as he was humbled by the notion that physics and mathematics are bigger than any one of us. Today, he feels the same way about Bitcoin, which is why he’s building a groundbreaking Layer 2 on the network. But, before we get to that, let me offer you some background on Schroé.  Frank Corva is the Business-to-Business Correspondent at Bitcoin Magazine and host of the new renaissance capital podcast.  Schroé completed a bachelor’s and master’s degree in engineering at KU Leuven, the best university in Belgium and one of the best universities in the world. For his graduate degree, he focused on cryptography with a specialization in authenticated encryption and forward secrecy. He pursued his studies in the school’s world-renowned Computer Security and Industrial Security (COSIC) program, where legendary cryptographers David Chaum and Len Sassaman once lectured. Schroé’s thesis advisor was Vincent Rijmen, inventor of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), which the U.S. government uses to protect classified data.  After graduating, Schroé couldn’t find a tech gig in Belgium, so he went into chemical engineering. He landed a job at a joint venture between ExxonMobil and SABIC in Saudi Arabia. On a business trip to Lebanon in 2019, he saw the ravaging effects of hyperinflation on the country. Deeply impacted by the experience, he decided to focus on building a better financial system on Bitcoin.  “I committed myself to spending all my resources, all my capabilities to make sure I helped Bitcoin succeed as soon as possible, because I could really see the world was moving faster and faster into a darker place,” says Schroé. “I see Bitcoin as being the light.”  Soon after, he applied and was accepted to Harvard Business School. While at Harvard, he continued to think about how to move Bitcoin forward but also took notice of the popularity of NFTs and the amount of trading volume on decentralized exchanges (DEX). He still believed in bitcoin as sound money but could not ignore the other technologies in the crypto space that were achieving product-market fit. This is when he conceptualized Botanix, a Bitcoin Layer 2 that employs bitcoin as money on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) via a novel design structure that Schroé calls “the spiderchain.” The name Botanix was inspired by the subject of the book he won at age 17 — a nod to the idea that Bitcoin, which is governed by mathematics, is bigger than all of us.  Fast-forward to late-2023 and the Botanix testnet is live.  I spoke with Schroé virtually while he was attending ETHDenver, in March, to learn about how he thinks Botanix will be received by both the Bitcoin and Ethereum communities, why proof-of-stake is a secure consensus mechanism for a Bitcoin Layer 2 and what challenges he’s faced in deploying the Botanix testnet.  Interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.  Please tell us about what you’re building at Botanix. You’re bringing the EVM to a Bitcoin Layer 2. Why do you think people want to use their bitcoin on the EVM?  I started realizing there's a split between Ethereum the asset and Ethereum the virtual machine. I strongly believe that a lot of the value that's being created on Ethereum is actually reflected in the EVM. When I think about the future running on Bitcoin — if you think 100 years ahead and the whole world runs on Bitcoin — you need to have stock exchanges, you need to have the whole financial system [on Bitcoin].  Bitcoin is a big breakthrough in terms of money, but EVM is the big breakthrough in terms of financial system  Decentralized exchanges on Ethereum are a 10x version of stock exchanges. If you compare Uniswap to the New York Stock Exchange, Uniswap is way more efficient and open 24/7. It's permissionless, capable of being accessed by anyone in the world. But I strongly believe that bitcoin is the best money. Like Michael Saylor would say, there is no second best. So, it makes the most sense to actually build [financial services] natively on Bitcoin. That's what we want to do, and I think it will play out very fast, because you can copy-paste any smart contract on Ethereum today and deploy it on Botanix.  When you start seeing that happen — when you see the bitcoin in your MetaMask — you realize that the EVM is just a software layer. To answer your question: “What would people want to do with their bitcoin?” One, since all the gas fees and transaction fees are in bitcoin on the second layer, you will be able to stake bitcoin and actually get native bitcoin yield. You will be able to trade bitcoin against other tokens. You will be able to launch a bitcoin-backed stablecoin on Bitcoin.  All these applications have reached product-market fit. This is the next step in actually building a whole world that runs on Bitcoin. It also immediately scales Bitcoin. We go from Bitcoin on the base layer with 10 minute blocks — very slow, fully decentralized. Botanix is a little bit faster — 10 second blocks like Ethereum and as decentralized as Ethereum. Then you go from there. You have the Layer 2s on Ethereum right now with very high throughput, like 0.2, 0.1 second blocks. You can have that as Layer 3 on Botanix. It's copy-paste.  Suddenly, you can see a future where you can scale Bitcoin to eight billion people. 100 years from now you'll have DEXs and decentralized lending and borrowing protocols [on Bitcoin], which is a 10x better version of the financial system that we have today. Bitcoin is a big breakthrough in terms of money, but EVM is the big breakthrough in terms of financial system.  You used the phrase “100 years from now.” You’re obviously thinking long-term when it comes to Botanix. Do you envision tokenized versions of all real world assets (RWA) on Bitcoin?  Absolutely. That is the vision. I think we are going through the same cycle we saw over the last 100 years. When you go back 100 years, before the SEC existed, the 1910s or the 1920s, there were no rules and everybody could launch stocks for their own company. Today, that’s what we see with all the tokens. There's no regulation. In this new financial system, we are in the 1910s again. What I see a hundred years from now is bitcoin being the money and having a full financial system also running in a more decentralized, more permissionless version than we have today. I would hate it if we ran the whole world on Bitcoin but with the current financial system, where all the bitcoins are with central banks. They will just loan them out again and create new fake bitcoin. I do not want that future.  You’ve said that the EVM isn’t the best virtual machine technology out there. If you feel this way, why use it?  The parallel I always make is to Microsoft Windows in the 80s. Any software technology battle follows the same principles and rules. Windows in the 80s didn't win because it was the best or most secure technology. The reason it gained so much adoption is distribution. Windows was by far the best in distribution.  The EVM is definitely not the best, definitely not the most secure. There have been so many hacks on the EVM, but this gave rise to the whole audit industry. You also have a Lindy effect happening on the EVM [with certain dapps]. You could argue “Okay, we've seen a few smart contracts like Uniswap survive for so long without any smart contract hacks.” They could be considered more secure. But the base layer of the EVM is definitely not the most secure. It just has the biggest distribution.  I heard both yourself and some other more technically-minded people in the space say that proof-of-stake works for a second layer on Bitcoin but not as a base layer. Why is that?  That is a very good question. I was actually a proof-of-work maximalist before designing the spiderchain, but I realized that a proof-of-work on a second layer actually doesn't make a lot of sense. So, I looked into proof-of-stake and read all the different white papers. In 2022, when Ethereum merged to proof-of-stake, there were a lot of Bitcoiners, including Jack Dorsey, who were retweeting this article about why proof of stake is insecure. So, I read the article. Each of the arguments in it were actually solved if you build with proof-of-stake on a second layer. Let me go quickly over the arguments. Number one is the economic argument. Proof-of-work is a leaking system and proof-of-stake is a closed system. That means that proof-of-work has a decentralizing trend. You need to pay for the electricity, so value leaks out of the system. Bitcoin, over time, becomes more and more decentralized, because that value leaks out into the real world. Proof-of-stake is the opposite. It actually has a centralizing trend. The stakers get a bigger and bigger portion of the total 100% share of the assets over time. As a layer one, as a currency, that doesn't make a lot of sense.  With a second layer fully running on bitcoin, you can use proof-of-stake, which has a small centralizing trend. Let's say that 10-30% of all the bitcoin would be on the second layer. That is counteracted by the 100% of bitcoin that is actually decentralized. So, that's solved. The second argument is finality. The problem with proof-of-stake is what you call the nothing-at-stake attack. Basically, you stake some bitcoin, then you fork the chain and take away some bitcoin on one of the forked chains. So, you no longer have anything at stake and you can do a double-spend.  So, you’re leveraging all of these important dynamics from Bitcoin’s proof-of-work consensus mechanism. Now, please explain to us how the spiderchain works.  The spiderchain is designed to be inherently decentralized. When we started to design it, we looked at all Layer 2s and realized that all of them are basically centralized. All the Ethereum sits in a centralized smart contract. We designed the spiderchain to be capable of being as decentralized as Ethereum.  We saw the power of the EVM and we designed Botanix to be [compatible] with the Bitcoin Core, capable to run an EVM and decentralized. That is the box that we designed in to come up with the spiderchain. We call it a decentralized network of multisigs. We designed it much like the Lightning Network. The Lightning Network is actually a decentralized network of two-out-of-two multisigs. Take the idea of the Lightning Network, but think of it bigger. If you have 10,000 different people all running a full Botanix node, you will create a series of multisigs. You randomly choose 100 participants out of the 10,000 and they will secure multisig one. Then you do that again for multisig two and randomly choose 100 participants out of the 10,000 different nodes, and they will secure multisig two. You do that again for multisig three, and four, and five, and, after a while, you create a series of multisigs that create this whole overlay network on Bitcoin that anyone can participate in.  This network of decentralized multisigs is the spiderchain. Then you use that with a proof-of-stake consensus. If you try to steal any bitcoin, you'll get slashed. Proof-of-stake both secures the decentralized network, where the bitcoin actually sits in the multisigs, and the EVM.  You’ve said that you expect to get a lot of heat from both Bitcoin and Ethereum maxis for what you’re building. What has been the reaction from the Ethereum crowd?  On the ETH side of things, you have two typical people. You have the OG Bitcoiners, the people who started in Bitcoin, couldn't build on it and moved away from it. They went to Ethereum, but somewhere in their hearts, they still loved Bitcoin. There's a lot of people like that. A lot of the founders of Ethereum apps are OG Bitcoiners — even Vitalik [Buterin], right? Then you have the Ethereum maxis that probably entered the space during 2021-2022, and they just consider bitcoin a store of value. They don't understand why you would want to build on Bitcoin.  Ordinals, NFTs and BRC-20s blew up because suddenly you could do something with bitcoin  Do you find that there are plenty of people out there who like Bitcoin and Ethereum? Are people not as tribal as they appear to be on X (formerly Twitter)?  There's way more than people realize. When you look at Twitter, you hear the loudest voices, the most extreme voices. But I would say the majority of Ethereum enthusiasts have some bitcoin in their cold wallet. The fact is you cannot do anything with [bitcoin]. [In a follow-up interview, Schroé clarified that he meant to say you cannot do many things with bitcoin on-chain. He also shared that he’s well aware that just holding bitcoin as a hedge against currency debasement or using it for transactions in the real world has great value.]  There's no infrastructure to do something with it. You can go on Lightning and send a transaction, but that's about it. Botanix suddenly changes that. A big reason why Ordinals, NFTs and BRC-20s blew up is because suddenly you could do something with bitcoin. There's this huge amount of demand that is just waiting for applications. I'm seeing it coming from people who are ideologically more on the Bitcoin side and people who are more ideologically on the Ethereum side.  I wish you the best of luck in bringing the mainnet live. Do you have any final thoughts you’d like to share?  Try out the testnet. Once you see Bitcoin in your MetaMask, it’s a game-changer. If you've always wanted to build something on Bitcoin but couldn't and you've been building on Ethereum, definitely think about building on Botanix. If you are an Ethereum developer, and you've developed a smart contract, you have to ask yourself the question: “Where do I deploy? Do I deploy on Ethereum in a crowded market where you fight for TVL and users? Or I deploy on Botanix with a trillion dollars of TVL (referring to bitcoin on the base chain)?” It makes way more sense to deploy it on Botanix. Over the next two or three years, you'll see that play out. Over 10 years, you'll 100% see that play out, because bitcoin will always be the biggest capital pool [of any crypto asset].",POSITIVE,ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | ZRX,Frank Corva,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2024/04/11/willem-schroe-building-botanix-a-bitcoin-layer-2-that-brings-the-evm-to-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/02052791626bf6020faa43bd5c3165bcd6f48cb4-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42418415,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTgxf3,1712862870,"Avi Eisenberg May Testify in $110M Crypto Fraud Trial, Defense Says","Crypto trader Avi Eisenberg may testify at his criminal commodities fraud and manipulation trial, his defense team said Thursday. They have yet to make a final decision on the matter as the government's case nears its conclusion.  The 28-year old crypto trader could face as much as a 20-year prison sentence if the 15-person jury convicts him on all three counts stemming from his October 2022 trades on the DeFi trading platform Mango Markets, which netted him at least $110 million in various cryptocurrencies. The government seeks to portray that trade as an illegal windfall from market manipulation, while the defense calls it a legitimate trading strategy.  Prosecutors are nearing the end of their week-long case against Eisenberg. On Thursday, they called a special agent and an expert witness that walked the jury through how Eisenberg allegedly drove up the price of MNGO tokens on AscendX, FTX and Serum in order to inflate the value of perpetual contracts he was trading on the Mango Markets decentralized exchange. Then, they said, he borrowed or withdrew well over $100 million from the exchange.  The government's case against Eisenberg hasn't yet arrived at the aftermath of that trade, when Mango Markets founder Dafydd Durairaj negotiated the return of $67 million to the platform and in exchange promised not to seek charges against him. Prosecutors on Thursday told the court they were no longer planning to call Durairaj to the stand.

This adjustment, recorded at 86.4 trillion, marks a crucial milestone in the cryptocurrency’s history. Decrypting Bitcoin’s Mining Complexity Notably, Bitcoin mining difficulty measures miners’ complexity in solving mathematical puzzles to validate transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Go ‘Ballistic’ After Halving, Says Top Analyst – Here’s Why This latest surge reflects the increasing computational power dedicated to securing the network as miners brace themselves for the impending Halving event scheduled for April 20. As the mining difficulty continues to soar, miners ramp up their hash rate, representing the total computational power contributed to the network. This surge in hash rate underscores the growing interest and investment in Bitcoin mining infrastructure, highlighting miners’ commitment to secure the network and reap rewards amidst the evolving landscape of crypto mining. Bitcoin Bullish Sentiment Amid Rising Mining Difficulty The surge in mining difficulty and hash rate comes amidst a bullish sentiment surrounding Bitcoin’s price and its potential for further growth. The impending Halving event will see block subsidy rewards reduced from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, potentially impacting miner revenues and the overall network dynamics. Despite these uncertainties, as the halving event draws nearer, Bitcoin has demonstrated resilience, maintaining its upward trajectory. Over the past week, the cryptocurrency has surged approximately 2.5%, with a 1.5% increase in the last 24 hours alone. As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $69,921, reflecting its bullish momentum. Amidst these slight positive price movements and the impending Halving, Bitcoin enthusiasts and analysts have continued to express optimism, instilling confidence in investors and traders awaiting a potential BTC price spike. Notably, prominent figures like Robert Kiyosaki, author of “Rich Dad, Poor Dad,” have recently echoed bullish sentiments, endorsing the price predictions put forth by Ark Invest founder Cathie Wood. Related Reading: Crypto Prophet Jeremy DaVinci Predicts Bitcoin Surge: Are We Headed For $130,000?

42408500,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaJQmc,1712861969,The SEC’s Suit Against Uniswap Is an Opening Attack Against DeFi,"Uniswap Labs, the Brooklyn-based outfit primarily responsible for developing the protocol of the same name, reportedly received a Wells Notice indicating the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission intends to sue. While the decentralized finance (DeFi) behemoth said it is “ready to fight” the SEC, indicating a willingness to go to court, the move does represent the latest front in the SEC’s yearslong battle with the crypto industry.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  And to some extent, it is entirely predictable. Before this, the SEC has filed suit against U.S.-based exchanges Coinbase and Kraken. In fact, the reason the industry is so familiar with the term “Wells Notice” is because Coinbase received one in the months before the SEC’s lawsuit dropped. But the move is also a serious escalation in the SEC’s anti-crypto legal barrage.  “Taking into account the SEC’s ongoing lawsuits against Coinbase and others as well as their complete unwillingness to provide clarity or a path to registration to those operating lawfully within the US, we can only conclude that this is the latest political effort to target even the best actors building technology on blockchains,” Uniswap said on a blog announcing the Wells Notice.  The SEC’s biggest crypto cases so far have been after centralized institutions — the aforementioned centralized exchanges Coinbase and Kraken and the company behind the XRP cryptocurrency, Ripple. Suing the organization behind a decentralized protocol like Uniswap is uncharted territory.  Perhaps the closest example on the books would be the SEC’s case against LBRY, which built a decentralized alternative to YouTube that was forced to shut down after a lengthy appeals process with the U.S. securities watchdog. The SEC alleges LBRY sold unregistered securities via a utility token launch, and initially sought $22 million in fines but lowered that to $111,000 after acknowledging the company’s financial struggles.  See also: What Happens if the SEC Classifies ETH a Security?  The ongoing, international cases against the developers of Tornado Cash might also be instructive, considering those cases in the U.S. and the Netherlands have become symbols of whether or not individuals are responsible for how their self-executing code is used after releasing it to the public.  “The SEC is very imaginative in the ways that you can be violating their rules,” Bill Hughes, senior counsel and director of global regulatory matters at Consensys, told CoinDesk. Part of the issue, conceivably, is that Uniswap Labs runs the biggest portal onto the Uniswap protocol via uniswap.org. Another potential concern is the UNI governance token, launched to give users some control over protocol governance but could be twisted to look like a securities offering.  That said, Hughes doesn't think the SEC will pursue cases against Uniswap token holders or users. ""If you are one of those and a little freaked out, take a breath and calm down,"" he said on X. ""If they were also going to sue YOU, then you'd be getting an email from the SEC asking to talk to you on the phone. You aren't going to be getting one of those so relax.""  Whatever the case, Hughes suggested this is likely just the biggest shot the SEC will take against the DeFi industry. The SEC’s move “has been to sue somebody in some category and one or two others before moving on to another category … like suing Coinbase and then Kraken. We'll see if they sue other DEXes.”  CORRECTION (April 11, 2024, 19:44 UTC): Fixes the spelling of Uniswap's name in the headline.",NEGATIVE,ETH | UNI,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | UNI,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/04/11/the-secs-suit-against-uniswap-is-an-opening-attack-against-defi,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a226129366e5c7dfdca85a8b8644cb4a805fe51c-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The decision to drop the case comes a month after a U.K. judge definitively ruled that Wright is not the inventor of Bitcoin.  Craig Wright has dropped his appeal against Norwegian bitcoiner Hodlonaut, ending a nearly five-year-long legal battle over a series of social media posts in which Hodlonaut called Wright a “scammer” and a “fraud” for claiming to be the inventor of Bitcoin.  A Norwegian judge sided with Hodlonaut after a 2022 trial in Oslo, concluding that he had “sufficient factual grounds to claim that Wright had lied and cheated in his attempt to prove that he is Satoshi Nakamoto.” Hodlonaut brought the case against Wright to preempt him from moving forward with a defamation case about the same social media posts in the U.K., where laws are heavily tipped in favor of the plaintiff, and monetary damages can be enormous.  The infamously litigious Wright appealed the court’s decision. But, according to Hodlonaut, Wright has now dropped that appeal.  “Just got off the phone with my Norwegian lawyer. CRAIG WRIGHT DROPPED THE APPEAL IN NORWAY!,” Hodlonaut wrote in a social media post, adding, “I’m very happy!”  Wright’s decision to back down comes just a month after he lost a separate court case in the U.K. that severely hobbled his ability to claim Satoshi’s throne. The Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA) sued Wright in 2021 in order to prove that he was not, in fact, the inventor of Bitcoin and to stop him from being able to claim copyright of the Bitcoin whitepaper or sue Bitcoin developers or others under the guise of being Satoshi.  In March, U.K. Judge James Mellor found in favor of COPA, stating that Wright “is not the author of the Bitcoin white paper…is not the person who adopted or operated under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto….is not the person who created the Bitcoin System…[and] is not the author of the initial versions of the Bitcoin software.”  The famously bellicose Wright has been largely quiet in the wake of Judge Mellor’s decision, as has his billionaire benefactor Calvin Ayre. The day after the COPA trial ended, Ayre posted a farewell message on X, saying that the message would be his “last” before taking off on “an adventure I have planned for the last year.”  Despite the conclusion of Wright’s appeal in Norway, other litigation involving Wright – including another defamation case against Hodlonaut in the U.K. – remains pending.

42408499,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaJQpv,1712859924,FTX Founder Sam Bankman-Fried Appeals Fraud Conviction,"FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried filed to appeal his conviction and sentence for fraud and conspiracy charges on Thursday, hours before his deadline to do so.  Bankman-Fried was convicted last November after a month-long trial on seven different charges, including fraud against FTX customers and Alameda Research investors. His companies filed for bankruptcy the year prior.  Earlier this month, Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in federal prison for his role in the collapse of the exchange, along with 3 years of supervised release and $11 billion in forfeiture.  New York District Court Judge Lewis Kaplan said Bankman-Fried was not remorseful for his crimes, and called his altruistic persona an “act.” Kaplan said that the sentence – which was much lower than the 40-50 year sentence requested by federal prosecutors but higher than the 6.5 year sentence Bankman-Fried’s legal team suggested – was necessary in order to ensure Bankman-Fried was unable to commit similar crimes in the future.  Though Kaplan ordered Bankman-Fried be remanded to a low or medium-security prison near his parents in Northern California, citing his autism as a risk factor for him in a maximum security facility, Bankman-Fried has surprisingly asked to be kept in the notorious Manhattan Detention Center during his appeal process.  Bankman-Fried’s former colleagues and co-conspirators – several of whom turned over evidence on him and testified at his trial – have yet to be sentenced for their roles in the fraud.  Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas in November 2022, shortly after FTX and Alameda – alongside affiliates worldwide – filed for bankruptcy, following the publication of a CoinDesk article revealing oddities in its balance sheet.  Federal prosecutors said he deliberately stole customer and investor funds, and lied about what the funds would go toward, during his trial last October.

42408498,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaJQjJ,1712858872,"Ethereum's Next Upgrade, 'Pectra,' Could Include Relief for Institutional Stakers, Wallet UX Improvements","Ethereum developers, fresh off the successful Dencun upgrade, which enabled a major change to make it cheaper to transact on layer-2 blockchains, are moving ahead in planning the blockchain's next improvements.  The contents of the next upgrade, ""Pectra,"" are nowhere near finalized, but developers have previously said their aim with the upgrade will be to ship it while simultaneously working on the chain's next upgrade.  “The idea with Pectra is to try and find a bunch of small wins that we can get relatively quickly while we prototype the larger stuff,” Tim Beiko, protocol support lead at the Ethereum Foundation, told CoinDesk in an interview on The Protocol podcast  Attendees at Thursday's Etheruem All Core Developers call – a bi-weekly meeting of the blockchain's primary developers – signaled that Pectra is likely to include Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 3074, a proposed set of code changes for improving the user experience (UX) of Ethereum wallets. Specifically, the proposal will allow users to batch transactions and sign off on them all at once.  Another one of the main changes likely to occur in Pectra will be a lift to the staking limit for validators, from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH – a 64-fold increase. That proposal, known as EIP 7251, would allow large staking providers, like Coinbase or Lido, to consolidate their validators operating the Ethereum blockchain – while allowing them to avoid constantly creating new validators every time they have another 32 ETH to stake.  According to Dune Analytics, over 1 million validators are currently operating the Ethereum network, which has led to concern over excessive latency. Developers have been looking for ways to slow the rate at which new validators enter the system – potentially bogging it down. EIP 2751 is pitched as a way to lighten the operational load for larger stakers, consolidate the number of validators on the blockchain, and allow staking providers to deploy less resources to staking and validating.  The name ""Pectra"" is a portmanteau of two simultaneous upgrades happening on the different layers of the blockchain. The execution layer, where protocol rules are enforced, will undergo the ""Prague"" upgrade, and the consensus layer, which ensures that blocks are validated, will go through the ""Electra"" upgrade.  Ethereum developers are known for Brangelina-ing their upgrades, like the previous one where the simultaneous Deneb and Cancun upgrades were referred to as “Dencun,” (and “Shapella” prior to that.) The Ethereum naming convention follows the different cities that Devcon took place in for the execution layer, and for the consensus layer, it follows an alphabetical order of the name of stars.  Other EIPs for consideration include triggering validator withdrawals from smart contracts, adding a code change known as BLS precompile, and removing the deposit window. These are relatively small changes to the network for the developers to work on.  The upgrade following Pectra will include long-awaited ""verkle trees"" – a new type of data system designed to help Ethereum nodes store large amounts of data.  Beiko said developers would aim to push Pectra out sometime at the end of 2024, maybe early 2025. “It's going to be a relatively small upgrade. The reason for that is that it allows us to work on two forks in parallel. We are working on Verkle trees and that transition,” Beiko said. “We are working on that but it's going to take more than a year. So in the meantime we have bandwidth to work on other small wins.”  Read more: Ethereum Finalizes 'Dencun' Upgrade, in Landmark Move to Reduce Data Fees",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/04/11/ethereums-next-upgrade-pectra-could-include-relief-for-institutional-stakers-wallet-ux-improvements,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/75360e19058508ba76b61e1971cb0c08940281bd-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Kamino, another competitor, also saw $81 million in new deposits.  MarginFi is still Solana's second-largest borrow and lend service and fifth-largest DeFi protocol by TVL despite seeing a 31% deposit exodus in a single day.  Wednesday's leadership chaos at MarginFi sparked an exodus of $200 million in crypto capital from the borrow-and-lend service. Rather than staying on the sidelines, those coins are now flowing into competing platforms on the Solana blockchain.  The biggest winner appears to be Solend. In the past 24 hours, it has seen deposits worth $17 million, its largest single-day deposit jump since July 2022. Solend's deposits increased nearly 12% in a single day, and its token rallied 37% over the same period.  These spikes come after Solend's leader, the pseudonymous 0xRooter, offered a token airdrop to lenders who moved their money from MarginFi to his platform, one of the oldest borrow-and-lend outposts in Solana DeFi.  By sheer numbers, Kamino saw the largest jump of $81 million in new deposits, or 8.5% in a single day, per DeFi Llama. It doesn't have a token yet but is expected to airdrop one to its users later this month. Before the chaos began, Kamino had already jumped MarginFi to become Solana's largest borrow-and-lend platform.  Drift saw a modest increase of $3.38 million in deposits. It runs a combined platform that offers borrow-and-lend, yield-generating strategies and perpetual futures exchange services.  MarginFi remains Solana's second-largest borrow and lend service and fifth-largest DeFi protocol by TVL despite a 31% deposit exodus in a single day. The fiery resignation of its longtime CEO Edgar Pavlovsky leaves its immediate leadership structure and future uncertain, though its on-chain programs continue to run as designed.  MarginFi’s longtime leader, Edgar Pavlovsky, resigned Wednesday following an internal dispute at the protocol's builder, mrgn.

This has no doubt caused concerns in the XRP community, considering the impact that the derivatives market has on a crypto’s price. $1.32 Million XRP Positions Get Liquidated Data from Coinglass shows that $1.32 million has been liquidated from the XRP market in the last 24 hours. Long positions account for a majority of these liquidations, with $1.04 million in long positions being wiped out during this period. This underlines the bearish sentiment plaguing the XRP ecosystem, with the bears firmly in control. Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin Halving Influence Is No Longer Driving Price, Here’s What Is This bearish outlook is also evident in several other key metrics in the XRP derivatives market. For instance, the total trading volume and open interest have dropped by 36.90% and 2.69%, respectively, which suggests that crypto investors are choosing to stay out of the XRP market. Meanwhile, there has also been a decline in the options volume, further suggesting that crypto investors have reduced their bets on the the altcoin. This is, however, not surprising considering how XRP has maintained a tepid price action despite the broader crypto market enjoying significant price gains at different times. Despite XRP’s current market conditions, there are still those betting heavily on a bullish future trajectory for the crypto token. This includes crypto expert Zach Rector, who has stated that the altcoin will “not miss the bull run” despite its current price action. He alluded to XRP’s fundamentals as one reason for his belief. More recently, he mentioned that XRP will soon experience a supply shock with increased token burns on the horizon. These token burns help reduce the number of tokens in circulation and can help drive up the token’s value through scarcity. Time To Accumulate More Tokens Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto recently mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that it was time to accumulate more XRP. He made this statement while highlighting an ascending triangle on XRP’s monthly timeframe, which “screams bullish.” In anticipation of this bullish move, the analyst urged crypto investors to “accumulate more, and then just sit back and wait for the magic to happen.” Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Drops Trading Strategy To Profit Off Shiba Inu’s Next Leg Up Above $0.00003 As to how high XRP could rise, Egrag stated that “the measured move of the Ascending Triangle could potentially reach either $17 or $27.” The analyst had also recently claimed that the altcoin would rise to $5 by July.

25571833,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=602717,1712854858,"Bitcoin “Looks Healthy” After 2 Months, Backs BTC To Rally Above $74,000","Bitcoin, one analyst notes on X, is looking healthy for the first time since the coin soared to over $70,000, printing all-time highs back in March 2024. The assessment is due to funding rates dropping to within ordinary levels, an indicator that volatility is also falling and moments of fear of missing out (FOMO) are fading. Funding Rates At “Normal Levels” As FOMO Dissipates In crypto perpetual trading, the funding rate is the fee exchanged between market participants. These fees are market-determined and are adjusted every eight hours or so. Depending on market conditions, they can be positive or negative. However, they play a critical role in determining momentum. Of note, bulls pay a fee to bears When perpetual prices are higher than the spot price. This, in turn, discourages buying in the perpetual market and incentivizes buying into the spot, bringing prices closer. Related Reading: CEO Throws Cold Water On May Ethereum ETF Approval – Impact On Price Whenever prices rally, as has been the case since the start of the year when Bitcoin has generally been in the green, those who enter long have to pay sellers to keep prices from deviating, as mentioned above. However, at spot rates, the rate leveraged buyers are paying is slightly lower as FOMO drops. Once prices rapidly expand, ideally above March 2024 highs, this funding rate will likely increase to February and March 2024 levels. So far, Bitcoin is changing hands above $70,800 at spot rates and within a bullish formation. Of note is that buyers are in charge of reversing losses posted on April 8. Even so, for the uptrend to remain, prices must break out above $72,500 and the April 8 high on rising volume. BTC will likely float to over $73,800 and enter price discovery in that case. Bitcoin Rises After CPI Data In The United States, Institutions Pouring In? With FOMO dissipating and “normalcy resuming,” the analyst said the coin is now better positioned to soar higher, backed by organic momentum generated from market participants. After dipping slightly on April 9, the coin rose following positive news about the Consumer Price Index (CPI) in the United States. While the “hot” CPI pushed other assets lower, Bitcoin prices bounced to spot levels. Experts say the coin might benefit as risk-averse traders shift to safe-haven coins to shield their value from raging inflation. Related Reading: Crypto Expert Unveils Most Undervalued Altcoin Right Now Beyond this, analysts expect demand for spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to rise in the months ahead. As institutions pour in, buying shares of spot BTC ETFs issued by players like Fidelity, the demand for the underlying coin might soar to fresh levels, lifting prices. Moreover, some analysts are bullish, saying prices will benefit once GBTC stops offloading coins.

Bitcoin At $82,000 Remains The Target Following the recent recovery observed today, Crypto Jelle, a popular cryptocurrency expert and Bitcoin enthusiast, has made a bullish forecast for the crypto asset, citing the $82,000 level in the short term. Crypto Jelle highlighted that after a fakeout, Bitcoin retested the cycle highs of 2021, bounced, and then broke out once more. According to the analyst, BTC now has just one more obstacle to surpass as a result of the retest. Related Reading: Are The Odds In Bitcoin Bulls Favor? These Analysts Forecast BTC’s Future Furthermore, he affirms that the race toward new highs will begin when the largest cryptocurrency asset manages to break and hold over $71,500. As a result, the crypto analyst anticipates a rally soon, placing the coin’s next target at around $82,000. Jelle has addressed a pressing issue in the crypto community. He mentioned some are still concerned about the next 3% move, whereas the higher timeframe chart seems more optimistic. Thus, he has urged investors to be patient and hold onto their bags to enjoy the positive move, as the crypto asset appears to be poised for significant growth in the upcoming months. With the impending halving event anticipated to occur this month, Jelle’s prediction could develop in a short period. Halvings have historically been seen to have a significant effect on the coin. If this year’s halving mirrors past trends, BTC could surge to $82,000 in weeks and even further upward. Several analysts believe that the event could propel the price of BTC to $150,000 before the end of the year. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $70,344, indicating a 1.84% increase in the past 24 hours. Both its overall market cap and trading volume have also risen by 1.87% and 13% respectively in the past day. Speculated Price Target For BTC This Month Ever since BTC witnessed a price recovery, many bullish predictions have surfaced concerning its next trajectory. Another analyst who has predicted BTC to reach above the $80,000 range is Adrian Zidanic. Related Reading: 12 Days Until Bitcoin Halving: Why $100,000 Isn’t Much Further Away During an episode on Thinking Crypto, Tony Edward the show’s host, drew attention to Zidanic’s prediction, in which the expert pointed out a bullish ascending triangle that is emerging in the Bitcoin chart within this consolidation phase. Zidanic foresees a breakout occurring shortly, with $86,500 as his target price. Although his projections acknowledge a greater likelihood of a positive scenario unfolding within the month. Examining the chart, Edward expressed his optimism that the aforementioned price could manifest post-halving. Edward believes it could move further to $90,000, underscoring his price range between $85,000 and $90,000 and urging the community to be patient.

Bridges serve a key role in connecting individual blockchains, but often are targets of exploits.  At the start, Transporter is available for Arbitrum, Avalanche, Base, BNB Chain, Ethereum, Optimism, Polygon, and WEMIX.  Data provider Chainlink {{LINK}} unveiled Thursday its blockchain bridge application called ""Transporter,"" which allows users to move crypto assets and data across multiple networks.  Chainlink's bridge is available for both individual users and institutions and aims to allow ""a cost-efficient way to make high-value token transfers across blockchains with peace of mind,"" a Chainlink spokesperson explained in an interview on Telegram.  The first available blockchains for Transporter are Arbitrum, Avalanche, Base, BNB Chain, Ethereum, Optimism, Polygon, and WEMIX, the press release said.  The release marks the entrance of the crypto world's key software platform that connects blockchain rails with external data – or oracle service – to the fast-growing sector of blockchain bridges. As the digital asset economy mushrooms, bridges serve a crucial role in connecting the ever-increasing number of individual blockchain rails, allowing the transfer of value and data between them. Existing bridges transferred some $12 billion worth of assets across chains through last month, DefiLlama data shows. However, bridges often are targets of exploits and hacks, carrying risks of losses for users.  Read more: What Are Blockchain Bridges and How Do They Work?  ""Having a secure way to move both value and data across chains is something the blockchain industry has needed for years,"" Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov said in a statement. ""Transporter makes it easier to utilize the security benefits of Chainlink's CCIP for the transfer of large token value and critical messages across chains.""  Transporter was built on top of Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), a piece of tech that has been a key component behind Chainlink's partnership with SWIFT, a closed network used by banks to make international money transfers.  The platform also offers global support and a real-time visual tracker to follow the status of transfer between chains. It charges the regular fee of using CCIP, which covers the cost of executing the transaction on the destination blockchain and the fees paid to CCIP service providers.

42408513,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaJRMz,1712850300,Crypto for Advisors: Are ETH ETFs Coming?,"After the successful launches of the spot bitcoin ETFs in the US, the next question is whether ether ETFs will be approved, with a May SEC decision looming. David Lawant, head of research at FalconX, and Purvi Maniar, the company's general counsel, discuss the considerations of such an approval and present the case that it’s likely when not if.  I provide insights into how crypto ETF approvals have driven regulatory certainty in other regions in Ask an Expert.  –S.M.  You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  To Approve or Not to Approve? Point/Counterpoint Perspectives on the Upcoming Spot ETH ETF Decision  A notable theme in the ongoing bull market is Ethereum's (ETH) underperformance, which has deepened over the past few weeks due to increasing skepticism about the odds of the spot ETF decision being approved by the SEC on May 23.  The ETH/BTC price ratio just dipped below 0.05, marking its lowest point since Ethereum began gaining traction as an institutional-grade asset in May 2021.  As late as February of 2024, the market was anticipating a green light from the SEC on May 23 following the spot BTC ETF approvals in January 2024. This view has been turning sour over the past few weeks, to the point that the current prevailing view is a denial by the SEC. The discount to NAV on the closed-ended Ethereum trust ETHE, a proxy for the market-implied likelihood of denial, increased from 8% to over 25% in the past month.  Spot ETH ETFs will remain a topic of conversation for the markets as we approach May 23 and the next few quarters if they are not approved by then. Let’s explore what the main arguments for and against approval are.  Point (the Consensus View): The Case for Denial  Over the past few weeks, the market has been trending toward expecting the SEC not to approve a spot ETH ETF at the end of May. This line of argument hinges on a few points.  First, there has been virtually no engagement between the SEC and issuers less than two months from the deadline. This contrasts sharply with the spot BTC approval process, where a back-and-forth was publicly visible through a flurry of amendment filings in the months leading to the approval. Contrary to what some have argued, the recent public call for comments is standard and should not be construed as engagement from the regulator.  Another critical factor is the view that the SEC approved the spot BTC ETF approval only begrudgingly. The use cases that ETH currently enables, such as decentralized finance, may make the review process for the SEC more fraught with complexities.  One such nuance is the continued lack of confirmation by the SEC on whether ETH is or is not a security despite its sister agency CFTC claiming it is a commodity.  Counterpoint: The Case for Approval  Some investors and analysts are making persuasive arguments against the mainstream narrative of denial, even if they are not necessarily calling for a May approval.  As Grayscale’s chief legal officer suggested, the absence of engagement does not necessarily predict the outcome. Contrary to the BTC spot ETF approval process, there isn’t much to discuss now. Most of the back-and-forth between the BTC ETF issuers and the SEC was around the redemption mechanism (cash versus in-kind), which is already a settled issue.  The one area where there may be room for discussion would be whether the SEC would allow native staking of ETH. Despite the push by some issuers, the broad view is that staking is unlikely to be allowed initially. That’s a straightforward issue the SEC can resolve at a potential rule-change approval or later when it reviews the S1 (or S3) forms required before launch.  In addition, a denial would likely be met with litigation from the applicants, and there is strong evidence that the issuers would have a strong case. The spot BTC ETF approval hinged on the high correlation between the spot BTC and CME BTC futures markets According to analyses by Fidelity, Bitwise and Coinbase, the same level correlations also exist for ETH, making it an unlikely issue for the SEC to raise again.  Looking Ahead  The spot BTC ETF approval in January did not come by a wide margin. Two of the five SEC commissioners voted in favor, two against, and Chair Garry Gensler tipped the scale. Gensler’s may be the casting vote again for the spot ETH ETF decision.  Out of the over 575 ETFs BlackRock has filed as an issuer, only one was denied by the SEC. Will the spot ETH ETF be the second? The market is attributing relatively high odds of denial, but if there’s one thing crypto investors have learned over the years, it's that last-minute surprises should never be ruled out.  Going beyond this approval cycle ending on May 23, it seems only a matter of “when” and not “if” for spot ETH ETFs to launch in the U.S. market. The arguments for approval will likely outweigh the ones for denial over time. As a result, even if approval does not come by May 23, the chances of a greenlight over the next 12-18 months seem high.  - David Lawant, Head of Research, FalconX  Ask an Expert  Question: What do the U.S. spot bitcoin ETF approvals in the U.S. mean?  The approvals provide regulated access to bitcoin, and the inflows highlight the tremendous demand for investing in digital assets. ETFs are a simple way for advisors to include crypto in their client portfolios. It’s hard to ignore the record inflows and AUM.  Question: Does this mean more approvals will be coming?  While I can’t speak to what any regulator will approve, I think it’s important to look at other regions and how regulatory approvals of ETFs transpired. For example, the first spot bitcoin ETF was approved in Canada in early 2021. A few months later, ether ETFs gained approval and began trading. Now, there are over 11 ETFs, including a mixed cryptocurrency ETF and an ether-staking ETF. If the same pattern follows, an ether ETF approval can be near.  Europe, Singapore, Australia and Dubai also have approved bitcoin ETFs available in their respective regions.  The other noteworthy item is the upcoming U.S. elections in November. The Republican party seems more eager for crypto legislation and adoption. A change in party incumbency may impact the broader digital asset landscape in the U.S.  Question: What comes next?  After the ETF approvals in Canada, the securities regulators created a registration framework and started defining structures for exchanges and crypto trading platforms requiring registration. Will the US follow suit now that ETFs are here?  A number of companies have now submitted spot bitcoin ETF applications to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The UK announced that crypto-traded notes can be traded on the London Stock Exchange starting in May. It will be interesting to see how global approvals impact the U.S. and other regions.  - Sarah Morton, chief strategy officer, MeetAmi Innovations Inc.  Keep Reading:  Some bitcoin ETF issuers don’t expect the SEC to approve ether ETFs anytime soon.  Deutsche Bank said of the more than 3,600 consumers surveyed recently, less than 1% see bitcoin as a passing fad, and 52% see bitcoin as an important asset class and payment system.

This coincides with a recent technical analysis by a crypto analyst, who predicted that ADA could drop to as low as $0.4. ADA Sees Decline In Trading Volume Data from the on-chain analytics platform Messari shows a decline in ADA’s trading volume from its recent peak. The crypto token recorded a daily trading volume of $1.53 billion on March 14 but has been on a steady decline since then, recording a daily trading volume of $445.83 million on April 10. Related Reading: Here Are The Drivers Behind The Bitcoin Price Crash To $68,000 Furthermore, data from IntoTheBlock shows three other on-chain metrics signaling a bearish sentiment for the crypto token. The first is the ‘Net Network Growth,’ which has experienced a 0.17% increase in the past week. This metric measures the total number of ADA addresses, meaning more users have left the ecosystem than new ones have come this last week. The second metric is the ‘In the Money,’ which has seen a 0.20% decline in the last seven days. This metric measures the number of ADA holders that are currently in profit at the crypto token’s price level. Meanwhile, large transactions on the Cardano network have also dropped lately, with a 2.60 decline. These large transactions refer to transactions that are over $100,000, suggesting that ADA whales are cooling off on investing in the crypto token. These bearish on-chain metrics further strengthen crypto analyst Alan Santana’s analysis, in which he mentioned that ADA could drop between $0.4444 and $0.3450. Back then, he noted that ADA still had a bearish outlook from a technical analysis perspective, and this outlook would extend until ADA found a strong support level on the charts. ADA’s Derivatives Market Also Shows Bearish Outlook Data from Coinglass shows that the bears are also firmly in control of the ADA ecosystem. In the last 24 hours, $632,720 has been wiped out from ADA’s derivatives market, with long positions ($502,170) accounting for most of these liquidations. Related Reading: Crypto Experts Predict Massive Price Surge For XRP Price, Is $20 Possible? Meanwhile, trading volume in ADA’s derivatives market has dropped by over 11%, suggesting a declining interest in the ADA token among crypto investors. Furthermore, the Options trading volume paints a more bearish picture, dropping by 92% in the last 24 hours. At the time of writing, ADA is trading at around $0.59, up over 1% in the last 24 hours according to data from CoinMarketCap.

A total of 43.4% of respondents of the American Association of Individual Investors, or AAII, Sentiment survey showed optimism about where the market is headed in the next six months, compared to 47.3% and 50%, respectively in the last two weeks. The percentage of those surveyed who felt bearish about the market also rose this week. It came in at 24%, compared to the 22.2% figure last week. Neutral sentiments also rose this week, with 32.5% of the respondents polled by AAII seeing no change in the market direction. The number was 30.5% the week before. The hotter-than-expected consumer inflation report released this week, which climbed 0.4% in March and exceeded the 0.3% rise that economists expected, dampened hopes of a near-term prospect for a Federal Reserve rate cuts. “Even without a war or any other event that causes a major disruption in global oil supplies, we see no scenario for U.S. inflation in which it is likely that the U.S. Fed would be justified in lowering interest rates, any time between now and October 2024,” pointed out Seeking Alpha analyst James Kostohryz. However, President Joe Biden still sees the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates by the end of the year, he said on Wednesday, standing by his prediction laid out last month. Nasdaq, S&P and Dow futures ticked higher on Thursday, following the report. The S&P 500 index ( SP500 ) fell nearly 1% in the last one week, while Dow Jones Industrial Average Index ( DJI ) declined over 1%. NASDAQ Composite Index ( COMP:IND ) fell 0.6%. NASDAQ 100-Index ( NDX ) declined 0.8%. Bitcoin USD ( BTC-USD ) rose 4% since last Thursday, while Gold ( XAUUSD:CUR ) rose nearly 3%. Gold futures racked up another record high settlement on Tuesday, extending its string of gains. However, the prices eased slightly on Wednesday.

There will likely be litigation against the SEC if the regulator doesn’t approve the products in May, the report said.  Spot ether ETFs will eventually be approved, the bank said.  Recent news that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is investigating companies associated with the Ethereum Foundation is consistent with the view that there is no more than a 50% chance of spot ether {{ETH}} exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval in May, JPMorgan (JPM) said in a research report on Thursday.  The bank reiterated its view that approval of these products is unlikely next month, a position first expressed in January. The SEC must make final decisions on some of the ETF applications by May 23. The SEC approved spot bitcoin {{BTC}} ETFs in January, stirring speculation in some quarters that versions for ether, the token of the Ethereum blockchain, may follow suit.  “If there is no spot ether ETF approval in May, then we assume there is going to be litigation against the SEC after May,” analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote.  JPMorgan said the most likely outcome is that the SEC will eventually lose this litigation, similar to what happened in the Grayscale and Ripple cases, and will eventually approve spot ether ETFs. But not in May.  One reason the SEC is likely to lose any litigation is because of the declining concentration in staking on Ethereum, raising the chance that ether will avoid being designated as a security, the report said.  The bank noted in a report last week that Lido’s share of staked ether has continued to fall, which should reduce concerns about concentration in the network.

This feat marks a historic moment for the token, symbolizing its growing popularity within the digital asset community. Analysis of address metrics on Glassnode reveals a steady uptrend in Shiba Inu’s address count over the past few months, culminating in this impressive milestone. Related Reading: Uniswap Bloodbath: UNI Price Crashes 16% On SEC Lawsuit Fears Address Growth Signals Potential, But Activity Paints A Different Picture While the increase in total addresses may initially appear promising, a closer examination of Shiba Inu’s activity metrics paints a contrasting picture. Despite the surge in address count, the number of active addresses has experienced a notable decline from previous highs. This discrepancy suggests that while there is a growing number of addresses associated with Shiba Inu, the level of actual activity within the network remains relatively low. Source: Glassnode Furthermore, the analysis of new addresses follows a similar downward trajectory, indicating a decrease in the rate of adoption or interest in the token. These trends raise questions about the sustainability of Shiba Inu’s growth and its ability to maintain momentum in the highly competitive cryptocurrency market. Shiba Inu Price Action Stagnates Amidst Uncertainty Against this backdrop of mixed signals, Shiba Inu’s price action has experienced a period of stagnation. Although there was a notable spike in price around March 5th, coinciding with increased address activity, the token has since struggled to maintain momentum. Currently trading around $0.000027, Shiba Inu’s price reflects a lack of clear directional bias, signaling uncertainty among investors and traders. Shiba Inu is now trading at $0.000027. Chart: TradingView Analysts attribute Shiba Inu’s stagnant price movements to a combination of factors, notably including prevailing sentiments across the cryptocurrency market and a lack of significant developments specific to the token. Despite its widespread recognition and community support, Shiba Inu’s valuation remains susceptible to external influences and market dynamics, indicative of the inherent volatility within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Related Reading: CEO Throws Cold Water On May Ethereum ETF Approval – Impact On Price While Shiba Inu enjoys a dedicated following, its price trajectory underscores the importance of monitoring both internal and external catalysts that could impact its valuation. Analysts caution investors to exercise prudence and recognize the nuanced relationship between Shiba Inu’s price and the broader cryptocurrency market dynamics. Trading Volume Indicates Stability Amidst Fluctuations Meanwhile, in addition to price action, the trading volume for Shiba Inu has remained relatively stable in recent times. With trading activity hovering around $527 million, there have been no significant spikes or declines observed in the near term. This stability suggests that while the overall market sentiment may be uncertain, there is still a consistent level of interest and participation in Shiba Inu trading activities.

Christian Langalis, whose photo-bombing of Janet Yellen became a viral meme, is auctioning the ""Buy Bitcoin"" sign he held up behind the then-Federal Reserve chair during her televised Congressional testimony in July 2017.  Flashback | Most Influential in Blockchain 2017 #1: Bitcoin Sign Guy  The sign, which Langalis drew on a lined yellow legal pad with a fine-point pen (a Uniball Vision, he told CoinDesk), will be listed Thursday on Scarce City, an online marketplace that sells physical and digital collectibles (and, naturally, accepts payment only in bitcoin).  In an interview with CoinDesk, Langalis said he would use the proceeds to fund his company, Tirrel Corp. The pre-seed-stage startup is building an implementation and wallet for Bitcoin's layer-2 Lightning network on top of Urbit, an open-source software project that attempts to rewrite the entire internet computing stack from first principles.  Flashback to 2022: Urbit Is Web3, Weird and Wonderful and I Don’t Care Who Made It  Asked how much he expected the memento – scribbled at a time when bitcoin {{BTC}} traded around $2,400 – to fetch, Langalis said, ""I try not to think about it."" However, he said that in recent weeks he received a private offer to buy the sign for five BTC, roughly $350,000 at recent prices. There is no reserve bid, or minimum price, he said.  Bidding for the sign will commence on April 18 and run for a week on Scarce City, but final bids will be entertained in person on April 24 at PubKey, a bitcoin-themed dive bar in New York (where a replica of the sign hangs on the wall). ""It's a way to celebrate with the community,"" Langalis said.  Read more: How PubKey Revived Bitcoin Culture in New York City  The image of Langalis behind Yellen (who is now the U.S. Treasury Secretary and lukewarm at best about crypto) drew international attention to bitcoin. After pulling the stunt, he was escorted out of the House Financial Services hearing room for violating committee rules, he said. By that time, the image was being widely shared on social media, although he didn't know it yet.  ""I was clueless,"" he said in a text message.

42408512,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaJRQI,1712836860,First Mover Americas: Uniswap's Token Slides on SEC Lawsuit,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Decentralized crypto exchange Uniswap received a notice from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it intends to pursue an enforcement action, the company said Wednesday. Uniswap's native token, UNI, dropped 9.5% immediately after the news and has lost 18% over the past 24 hours. Uniswap CEO Hayden Adams announced receipt of the so-called Wells notice on X, saying he wasn’t surprised, “just annoyed, disappointed, and ready to fight.” Wells notices are preliminary warnings that inform respondents of the charges the regulator is considering bringing against them. They usually lead to enforcement actions. In a press conference on Wednesday afternoon, COO Mary-Catherine Lader and Chief Legal Officer Marvin Ammori told reporters that the Wells notice was focused on Uniswap acting as an unregistered securities broker and unregistered securities exchange. It remains unclear whether the UNI token was implicated as a potential security in the SEC’s notice.  Bitcoin’s (BTC) much anticipated halving event later this month could see a flurry of bets on related networks and ecosystem tokens, with traders expecting upside on both technical and meme-coin projects. Halving reduces the rate at which new coins are created and lowers the available new supply. The current block reward is 6.25 BTC, and it will drop to 3.125 BTC after the halving. This event has historically preceded a bull market for the token. Crypto traders say participants seek a “reason to buy” as money narratives continuously shift in the current bullish environment and they may turn their focus on the bitcoin ecosystem in the coming weeks.  Heightened anticipation for spot-based bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. and the eventual inflows supercharged bitcoin's run-up to all-time highs, and now Hong Kong's regulators are reportedly inching closer to approving similar funds, news that thus far has been mostly unnoticed in crypto circles. These vehicles, however, could open the floodgates for Chinese investors looking for a new haven next to gold, overseas real estate and stocks in which to store their wealth. ""[They] will be a big deal,"" Noelle Acheson, macro analyst and author of Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, said in an email interview with CoinDesk. ""It's not just for the access to hedge funds and family offices based in the region; it's also because of the access it gives to mainland investors.""  Chart of the Day  The chart shows annualized three-month bitcoin futures premiums on major offshore crypto exchanges, Binance, OKX and Deribit.  While bitcoin has risen nearly 3% in the past 24 hours, the futures premium remains under 20%, hovering well below highs near 25% seen early this month.  The divergence suggests the latest upswing in prices may be spot-driven.

25560396,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=602662,1712836817,CEO Throws Cold Water On May Ethereum ETF Approval – Impact On Price,"The much-anticipated arrival of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US seems to be hitting a snag. Industry leaders are voicing growing concerns about the likelihood of securing regulatory approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), with a deafening silence from the agency fueling anxieties. Related Reading: Bitcoin Below $70,000: Is $80K Still Possible, Or Is The Rally Over? Jan van Eck, CEO of investment firm VanEck, recently cast a shadow of doubt on the possibility of SEC approval for spot Ether ETFs in May. In a CNBC interview, van Eck expressed his belief that their application would likely be rejected, citing a complete lack of communication from the regulatory body. This sentiment finds an echo in the words of Eric Balchunas, a Senior Bloomberg ETF analyst, who has significantly downgraded his odds of approval to a mere 35%. Balchunas attributes this pessimism to the ongoing “radio silence” between the SEC and fund issuers. Nice scoop from @joelight. Def interesting but no change our odds. As we’ve said, need SEC to give comments on the filing documents (the “critical feedback” he mentions) and that still ain’t happening, even in person they offering nothing. Silence is violence. https://t.co/z76KTtdmHU — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) April 8, 2024 Ethereum ETF Applications Languish In SEC Limbo The SEC’s lack of response extends beyond van Eck’s application. Seven other proposals for spot Ether ETFs are currently gathering dust, with no indication of progress. This regulatory purgatory is fueling skepticism among industry commentators. CoinShares CEO Jean-Marie Mognetti believes that approval for any of these applications is unlikely “this side of the year,” further amplifying the prevailing uncertainty. Ethereum is now trading at $3561.8. Chart: TradingView The current roadblock for Ethereum ETFs stands in stark contrast to the success story of Bitcoin ETFs. The SEC’s green light for Bitcoin ETFs offered a glimmer of hope for the cryptocurrency market. Van Eck highlights the growing interest in Bitcoin as a “maturing asset class,” with significant untapped investor demand. Notably, VanEck’s own spot Bitcoin ETF, known by the ticker HODL, has witnessed significant inflows since its launch in mid-January, signifying a strong investor appetite for crypto exposure. Lack Of Clarity Creates Murky Investment Landscape The lack of interaction from the SEC is a major concern for James Seyffart, another analyst in the field. He emphasizes that “zero comments or interactions from the SEC is a bad sign.” This sentiment suggests a troubling trend in the approval process, further dampening hopes for a swift resolution on the Ethereum ETF front. Related Reading: Uniswap Bloodbath: UNI Price Crashes 16% On SEC Lawsuit Fears Despite the current cloud of uncertainty surrounding Ethereum ETFs, the cryptocurrency market continues to experience growth and gain wider acceptance. This indicates that opportunities for investment diversification in the digital realm are on the rise. However, until the SEC sheds light on its stance, investors and industry stakeholders will be forced to navigate a landscape fraught with uncertainty and intense regulatory scrutiny. The path forward for Ethereum ETFs remains shrouded in doubt. The SEC’s silence is deafening, and industry leaders are bracing for potential rejection. With a lack of clear communication and mounting skepticism, investors are left facing a blank wall, waiting for a sign from the SEC.

42408503,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaJQzq,1712836800,DePIN Platform Uplink Raises $10M Led by Framework Ventures,"Uplink, a company attempting to democratize internet access, announced a $10 million funding round led by Framework Ventures.  The firm is a Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN), a sector that data provider Messari estimates could have a market value of $3.5 trillion by 2028. DePIN projects connect blockchain technology with physical systems and often offer tokens to incentivize people to crowdsource the infrastructure.  Uplink provides decentralized network connectivity with the aim of creating better distributed and user-operated infrastructure. According to the company, the idea is to reduce reliance on traditional centralized telecommunication providers.  Users and enterprises will be able to earn tokens as a reward by either contributing to the network or using it. They can integrate their existing infrastructure into the Uplink network or install compatible hardware for their community/business. The company plans to launch a token later this year.  “By creating financial incentives that encourage people to increase DePin-powered internet access, more users will then be able to access connectivity wherever Uplink offers coverage and flag areas of need where it does not,” the company said in the press release.  According to Framework Ventures, Most DePIN projects, including Helium, have historically taken a retail-focused approach to initial distribution of the network and hardware. Helium is arguably one of the largest and first DePIN projects, with a market capitalization of almost $1 billion.

25564481,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=602733,1712835951,What to expect after the Bitcoin Halving: a look at post-halving performance,"The Bitcoin Halving is almost here, bringing about the most significant event in the Cryptocurrency market ever. Each event has had a dramatic impact on supply, demand, and price appreciation post-halving. But with Bitcoin price already setting a new all-time high before the halving for the first time ever, how might this change post-halving performance? Let’s take a closer look. What is the Bitcoin Halving? The Bitcoin Halving is a recurring event happening approximately every four years. By design, it is intended to increase the scarcity of BTC and strengthen the security of the network. However, it has the unintended effect of bringing more participants, speculation, and volatility to Crypto markets, driving Bitcoin price to astronomical new highs. Currently, miners unlock about 900 new BTC each day while contributing to the security of the Bitcoin network. After the next halving, this will be reduced to roughly 450 new BTC each day. This abrupt change in supply, coupled with growing demand is often an event worth paying attention to, as the following data will reveal. Past post-halving performance examined The first ever Bitcoin halving occurred on November 28, 2012. BTCUSD traded at around $10. Within one year, Bitcoin price climbed by nearly 10,000% to over $1,200 per coin. At this point, the top Cryptocurrency was still in its infancy, and few paid attention to the impact the halving had on price action. The second halving took place on July 9, 2016, some four years later. Cryptocurrencies were still relatively unknown at this point in time. However, new altcoins were starting to gain traction and the industry surrounding Bitcoin begane to develop. 16 months later, BTCUSD rallied from $570 at the July 2016 halving to just under $20,000 per coin, representing a 3,400% post-halving performance. By the third halving, which took place on May 11, 2020, the world had started to realise the correlation between BTCUSD performance and the proximity to the halving event. The halving happened just months following the COVID pandemic and unprecedented money supply expansion, resulting in a perfect storm for Bitcoin and investors. Within a year, Bitcoin soared from under $9,000 per coin to more than $65,000 per BTC. Although this is substantial in USD terms, this was only a 625% gain compared to 3,400% and 10,000% previously, setting the precedence for diminishing returns. Why the 2024 Bitcoin Halving could be different The Bitcoin Halving in 2024 is pegged for mid-April, and is already gearing up to be the most important event in Crypto history. While the phrase “this time is different” is considered the most dangerous in investing, this time, when it comes to Bitcoin, things are very different to the past. Despite the enormous bull markets that follow each halving, none of these rallies set a new all-time high beforehand. In 2024, Bitcoin has already set a new all-time high, which could either mean further diminishing performance, or a shocking rally that surprises the masses and only adds to the price tag of each BTC further. With each Bitcoin Halving, the market participants increasingly took note of its powerful impact on price appreciation. The halving is a publicly known event, and in 2024, the post-halving performance could have been front-run by so-called smart money, whales, and institutional investors, who are aware of the type of gains that are possible. Whether or not this means less performance post-halving remains to be seen. However, the reduction in new BTC available to miners should still impact the delicate balance of supply versus demand in favour of more price appreciation ahead after the event. Factors fuelling increased profit potential in Crypto The emergence of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States are one of the major factors causing the new price record ahead of the halving, and could further ignite a bull market post halving. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have been absorbing as much as 10 times the new supply from miners, and post halving this could increase to 20 times the new available supply if ETF demand remains consistent. Combined with demand from retail investors hearing about the halving in the media and in social circles, price could still rise substantially, even though Bitcoin is currently trading above former all-time highs from 2021 at $68,000 per coin.

Via a statement on X, Edwards pointed to PENDLE, a token operating within the DeFi space, citing its exceptional total value locked (TVL) and market cap as primary indicators of its undervaluation. “Perhaps the most undervalued alt right now is PENDLE. Massive $4.6B TVL (about 5% of entire crypto world’s TVL) and market cap just 14% of its TVL. Huge flywheel effects with Ethena also. Ludacris growth,” Edwards remarked, sharing the total value locked (TVL) chart by DefiLlama. Arthur Hayes, founder of BitMEX, also recently shared his optimism about PENDLE, reinforcing its potential within the DeFi sector with an enthusiastic, “The future of DEFI is PENDLE. Yachtzee bitches.” The future of #DEFI is $PENDLE. Yachtzee bitches 😘😘😘😘😘 pic.twitter.com/4MtqmQvjpR — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) April 5, 2024 Why Is PENDLE Crypto’s Hottest Altcoin? Since the start of January, PENDLE has seen a remarkable 590% increase in price, with a 220% spike in just the last four weeks alone, making it one of the top-performing assets in the broader cryptocurrency market. This surge aligns with a significant rise in Pendle’s TVL, which escalated from just under $240 million at the beginning of January to over $4.6 billion recently. Related Reading: “Where It Should Be”: Crypto Analyst Remains Firm On $1.7 Prediction For Cardano (ADA) Delving into the reasons behind PENDLE’s impressive trajectory, crypto researcher 100y.eth offered a detailed explanation on X, focusing on the token’s distinct utilities and tokenomics. “Pendle Finance revolutionizes DeFi by allowing the tokenization and separation of yield-bearing tokens into PT (Principal) and YT (Yield), tradable on Pendle’s AMM. This innovation is at the core of Pendle’s current popularity,” the researcher stated. Further shedding light on the factors driving PENDLE’s accumulation, 100y.eth referred to significant whale activity. “According to lookonchain, whales are still in the phase of accumulating PENDLE, a testament to their belief in its long-term value,” the researcher noted, citing substantial withdrawals from exchanges as indicative of investor confidence. Whales continue to accumulate $PENDLE! 0xe675 withdrew 295,443 $PENDLE($1.95M) from #Binance 3 hours ago and 372,752 $PENDLE ($2.46M) from #Binance 3 days ago. 0xAa4c withdrew 115,500 $PENDLE($764K) from #Binance 30 mins ago and 384,500 $PENDLE($2.54M) from #Binance 4 days ago.… pic.twitter.com/w1MZTUHSZp — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) April 10, 2024 The essence of PENDLE’s appeal lies in its vePENDLE system, which enhances its governance model and incentivizes long-term holding. “Magic resides in vePENDLE. By locking PENDLE, users receive vePENDLE, engaging more deeply with the ecosystem. This mechanism not only fosters community governance but also amplifies rewards for liquidity providers,” the researcher added. Related Reading: From Hat To Heights: Dogwifhat’s $17 Crypto Leap Electrifies Investors VePENDLE holders play a pivotal role in determining liquidity dynamics through their voting power, effectively channeling incentives to favored LP pools. “As of April 10, the rswETH Pool led with the most PENDLE votes, demonstrating the active engagement of our community in governance processes,” highlighted the discussion on yield dynamics and governance participation. The synergy between recent market developments and Pendle’s innovative tokenomics is generating unprecedented yield opportunities. “With the frenzy around LRT and Ethena, we’re seeing huge yields, including swap fees, accruing to vePENDLE holders. Voter APYs in popular pools have soared from 100 to 400%, a clear indication of Pendle’s growing allure,” the researcher elaborated. At press time, PENDLE traded at $7.37.

Regulators in the country have said around 60 firms are set to receive approval by April.  South Africa’s financial regulator has started issuing crypto licenses, with exchange platform Luno and decentralized social investing marketplace Zignaly among the first batch of companies to receive approvals.  Luno shared that it had received approval as a financial service provider under the country's Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services Act, 2002 (FAIS). Luno PTY LTD now appears on FSCA's registry of authorized entities.  Zignaly told CoinDesk that it had received a Category 2 - Discretionary Financial Service Provider (FSP) license and appears in the FSCA registry as Merritt Administrators PTY LTD.  The South African regulator started accepting licensing applications from crypto firms in June 2023 after legislation was passed to bring crypto into the scope of regulated financial activities in the country. The FSCA has promised hefty fines for companies that try to operate without obtaining the right approvals.  Around 60 firms are expected to be approved by the regulator in the short term.  “This is a positive step for both the cryptocurrency industry and South Africans. Compliance, safety and security for our customers have driven our growth since the beginning and will continue to be priorities as we expand our offering to introduce more features and products for financial institutions,” Christo de Wit, Luno’s country manager for South Africa, said in the statement.  Zignaly's Category 2 license will allow the company to conduct discretionary fund management, ""where Zignaly is authorized to make investment decisions on behalf of investors, and very importantly – may act as a custodian of funds for its clients,” the company said in a press statement. “It is essentially a full asset management license, comparable to what TradFi behemoths like Blackrock or Vanguard have at their disposal.”  Zignaly says the license will also help it “preempt the likely extension” of regulations to decentralized finance.

Lutnick says China may see a potential digital dollar as a spy wallet.  One of the long-running debates in the crypto market is whether U.S. dollar stablecoins – cryptocurrencies whose value is pegged to the currency – strengthen the greenback's global dominance. According to Cantor Fitzgerald's CEO, they do and are beneficial to the world's largest economy.  ""Dollar hegemony is fundamental to the United States of America,"" Howard Lutnick said during a Chainalysis Conference on Wednesday, according to Bloomberg. ""It matters to us, to our economy. That's why I'm a fan of properly backed stablecoins, Tether and Circle.""  Stablecoins are ""fundamental for the U.S. economy, driving demand for U.S. Treasury notes and do not pose a systemic risk to the world,"" he said.  The dollar's power in the global economy supposedly allows the U.S. to run large deficits, borrow at lower rates than other countries and impose crippling sanctions on enemy nations.  Cantor Fitzgerald is a custodian for Tether Holdings, the issuer of the world's largest stablecoin, tether (USDT). As of writing, USDT boasted a market cap of $107 billion, while second-ranked Circle's USDC had a market value of $32.25 billion, according to CoinGecko.  Crypto traders widely use stablecoins as funding currencies in the spot market and as collateral in derivatives trading. The cryptocurrencies also served as a haven during the 2022 Federal Reserve tightening cycle.  Investor confidence in stablecoins took a hit after Terra's algorithmic stablecoin, UST, collapsed in May 2022. Tether, however, passed the stress test, honoring redemptions amid lingering skepticism about the reserves that backed it. In January, Lutnick confirmed that Tether had the money to back USDT.  Lutnick, however, is not a fan of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and said Wednesday that China may view a potential digital dollar as an American spy wallet.  ""My fear is that central banks would like to issue a central bank digital currency, that makes sense right?"" he said. ""But the problem is what will China think, they will define it as the American spy wallet.""

42408511,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaJRTb,1712826104,Here's What the Bitcoin Options Market Says About Halving,"Bitcoin options show expectations for pre-halving price weakness and a bullish bias following the pivotal quadrennial event.  The long-term outlook depends more on macro factors than halving, analysts said.  Options market shows expectations for a price rally into six figures by December.  The bitcoin {{BTC}} options market, historically a reliable indicator of sentiment, is showing investors expect weakness in the run-up to the mining-reward halving due April 20 followed by a rally after the event, which reduces the pace of new bitcoin creation by cutting the per-block coin emission to 3.125 BTC from 6.25 BTC.  The world's largest cryptocurrency by market cap is currently trading about $71,000. Put options at strike prices of $61,000 and $60,000 listed on derivatives exchange Deribit have the highest build-up, respectively, of open interest among options expiring a week before and a day before halving, according to data tracked by Amberdata.  Put options are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying asset at the specified price at a later date. A put buyer is implicitly bearish on the market, looking to profit from or hedge against a price slide. Open interest refers to the number of active or open contracts at a given time.  The chart shows open interest distribution in options expiring on April 19, a day before halving is expected. At press time, open interest in the $60,000 put was 1,000 contracts or $70.90 million, the highest in the expiry. On Deribit, one options contract represents one BTC.  The temporary pre-halving nervousness is consistent with analysts' view that prices may wobble around the halving time.  Meanwhile, open interest in options expiring on April 26 – about a week after the halving – was more evenly distributed, with calls or bullish bets at $70,000 and $80,000 more popular than others. A call buyer is implicitly bullish on the market.  ""Right ahead of the halving, you have notable open interest in the $60,000 put expiring a day before the event, whereas month-end is a bit more spread out,"" Simranjeet Singh, a trader at the crypto trading firm and liquidity provider GSR, told CoinDesk. ""I guess some traders may want to fade the move in the short term, similar to the ETF event, until we reach a nice consolidation level for another leg higher.""  Singh said the next leg higher partly depends on the U.S. interest-rate outlook and political developments.  Bitcoin saw a brief drop to $67,600 on Wednesday after hotter-than-expected U.S. inflation data saw traders push back the timing of the first Fed rate cut to November from June. The losses were short-lived, with prices rebounding early Thursday as the rate cut remains on the table, though delayed.  ""The newly found 'Fed put' remains in place though, with the Fed focused on both risks to inflation and employment, rather than on inflation alone,"" trader and analyst Alex Kruger said on X. The ""Fed put"" is a notion that the central bank will come to the rescue if the economy or markets falter.  Trader Christopher Newhouse said bitcoin options expiring after May will be affected more by the macroeconomic environment and organic demand than the halving.  The large concentration of open interest in the $100,000 December expiry and the $200,000 March 2025 expiry calls shows expectations that macro factors would continue to act as a tailwind.  As of writing, the December expiry call at $100,000 had a notional open interest of $226 million, while the open interest in the March expiry call at $200,000 was $70.7 million.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/11/heres-what-the-bitcoin-options-market-says-about-halving,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7082c0bc8a09a5527ac657aa14cf9beac27d71a7-4096x2304.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42408510,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaJRJg,1712824712,"Bitcoin Ecosystem Tokens, RUNE, STX, and ORDI May See Gains After Halving","Bitcoin’s halving event could increase bets on related networks and ecosystem tokens, with traders expecting tokens such as STX, RUNE, and ORDI to rise.  Bitcoin-based meme coins, NFTs, and Ordinals could form part of a “barbell strategy” comprised of both technical and non-serious projects, some traders say.  Bitcoin’s {{BTC}} much anticipated halving event later this month could see a flurry of bets on related networks and ecosystem tokens, with traders expecting upside on both technical and meme coin projects.  Halving reduces the rate at which new coins are created and lowers the available new supply. The current block reward is 6.25 BTC, and it will drop to 3.125 BTC after the halving. This event has historically preceded a bull market for the token.  Crypto traders say participants seek a “reason to buy” as money narratives continuously shift in the current bullish environment and they may turn their focus on the bitcoin ecosystem in the coming weeks.  “There exists a large, untapped pool of capital within the Bitcoin ecosystem that remains dormant, and surprisingly few listed assets that traders can use to gain exposure to the narrative,” the OTC desk of trading firm Wintermute told CoinDesk over email.  “Should capital begin to rotate into the Bitcoin ecosystem, tokens like $RUNE, $STX, and $ORDI could benefit significantly and outperform,” they added.  THORChain’s RUNE and Stack’s STX have been among the top-performing tokens in the past year, CoinGecko data shows, tracking a bitcoin rise. Meme coin ordi (ORDI) – a nod to the Ordinals protocol on Bitcoin – has surged over 2,500% since its September issuance.  Meanwhile, Bartosz Lipinski is the founder of the crypto trading platform Cube.Exchange said in an email that meme coins and the upcoming Runes protocol could rile up risky bets in the bitcoin ecosystem.  “Ethereum’s high costs and significant network congestion will cause it to take a backseat as Bitcoin-based projects, like Rune, will redirect meme coin hype to the Bitcoin ecosystem because of the novelty,” Lipinski said. “The BRC-20 (Ordinals NFT) standard is likely to be overtaken by Runes, which is expected to launch on the day of the halving.”  “Runes will aim to replace the standard with fungible tokens, which will enable the efficient creation of meme coins to compete with projects on Base and Solana,” he added, referring to the ongoing frenzy for non-serious tokens in the two ecosystems.  Ordinals are a way to embed data into the Bitcoin blockchain by inscribing references to digital art into small Bitcoin-based transactions.  Ordinal volumes were higher than those of usual leaders Ethereum and Solana in the past week, as reported, led by NodeMonkes and Pups. Non-fungible token (NFT) on other networks buying and selling activity declined 95% across all networks in the same period, suggestive of an isolated interest in Ordinals.",POSITIVE,BTC | STX | RUNE | ORDI,BTC | TRADING | STX | RUNE | ORDI,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/11/bitcoin-ecosystem-tokens-rune-stx-and-ordi-may-see-gains-after-halving,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/096443e220527fab84e84cc9c7c6490ced45faf4-3888x2187.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This pre-enforcement notice, a precursor to potential legal action, triggered a plunge in Uniswap’s native token, UNI.

25549915,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=602621,1712820633,"Bitcoin To $100,000: Can Hong Kong’s Spot ETFs Make It Happen?","In a recent analysis, Stanislas Bernard, the founder of Sinz 21st.Capital, delved into the complexities surrounding Hong Kong’s consideration to approve spot Bitcoin ETFs against the backdrop of China’s escalating economic crisis. With the nation grappling with a record debt-to-GDP ratio of 288% in 2023, and witnessing one of the most severe housing market collapses in three decades, the financial instability has triggered an unprecedented capital flight towards overseas markets. The Perfect Timing For A Spot Bitcoin ETF? Amidst these turbulent economic times, Hong Kong’s potential approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs stands out as a pivotal development that could not only be a safe haven for Chinese investors but also significantly influence Bitcoin’s valuation, potentially catapulting it to the elusive $100,000 mark. China’s economic woes have been intensifying, marked by a towering debt ratio and a plummeting housing sector that has investors scrambling for alternatives. “China currently faces a significant economic downturn, exacerbated by soaring debt and malinvestments in real estate. The crisis, becoming well-known in 2021 with the default of Evergrande Group, has now spread, causing a ripple effect that will likely slow down the Chinese economy for years to come,” Bernard pointed out. Related Reading: Bitcoin Stays Sub $70,000 As Hong Kong Readies April-End ETF Launch This backdrop of economic instability has incited a significant shift in investor behavior, notably among Chinese investors who, faced with stringent capital controls, have sought refuge in ETFs that offer exposure to foreign markets. Yet, this avenue has been fraught with its own challenges. “Investors are paying premiums as high as 43% on certain US-focused ETFs due to quota limitations, which speaks volumes about the desperation to find safer investment harbors,” Bernard notes. Such premiums underscore the pervasive fear and uncertainty that have gripped the Chinese market, driving investors towards seemingly any available exit from the volatility of the domestic market. The Role Of Hong Kong Bernard believes that not only Hong Kongers but also Chinese mainlanders will flock to Bitcoin ETFs. “They are pretty integrated. Mainland is HK’s largest trading partner. Would not be possible to approve a spot ETF and then close it to mainland. They will enforce transaction limits instead,” the expert said. In the midst of these developments, Hong Kong’ Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) is reportedly considering the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs already by the end of April, as reported yesterday. This move is viewed as a strategic effort to capture a portion of the capital flowing into Bitcoin, especially in the wake of the SEC’s approval of similar ETFs in the US, which saw a meteoric rise with $12 billion of net flow. Related Reading: Bitcoin 2 Months Through “Euphoria Wave,” How Long Was The Last One? “Hong Kong is scrambling for a change. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs could unlock a vast reservoir of stranded Chinese capital into Bitcoin, providing a much-needed life raft for investors,” Bernard explained. The anticipated approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs by Hong Kong authorities has been met with significant enthusiasm within the crypto community. Influential figures such as Bitcoin Munger and Stack Hodler have been vocal about the potential impact of this development on Bitcoin’s price. “Hong Kong ETFs approval have accelerated to next week. Most accounts on CT weren’t making a big deal about them, but they are a big deal. They are going to take us to $100k+ in due time. Tick tock!” stated popular Bitcoin analyst Bitcoin Munger (@bitcoinmunger). He refers to the regional yearly year-over-year supply change from West to East. Stack Hodler (@stackhodler) further emphasized the urgency among Chinese investors to find secure investment avenues outside the traditional system, “Chinese investors were panic-buying a Gold fund at a 30% premium this month as they attempt to get their wealth into something outside the Chinese system. The approval of Hong Kong spot ETFs could be the turning point, offering a sanctioned avenue for wealth preservation amidst the crumbling real estate market.” Overall, the potential approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in Hong Kong is poised to be a landmark development, not just for the region but for the global market. By offering a secure and regulated channel for investment, it could serve as a catalyst for significant capital inflow into Bitcoin, reinforcing its status as a viable store of value. “As we stand at the cusp of this historic development, the implications for Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market could be profound. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in Hong Kong could indeed be the harbinger of a new era, potentially driving Bitcoin’s value to new heights,” concluded Bernard. At press time, BTC traded at $70,945.

The cryptocurrency’s RSI is 79.02, the highest since the 2021 bull market, indicating potentially overbought conditions.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} is outperforming most major assets, making everything else “look like junk,” Josh Olszewicz, a trader that publishes under the handle CarpoNoctom, said in a recent video, which analyzed its performance against major altcoins and other assets.  The world’s largest digital asset is trading above $70,000, according to CoinDesk Indices data. Bitcoin has outperformed the CoinDesk 20 (CD20) Index, a measure of the most liquid digital assets, by over 10% since the beginning of the year.  Looking back further, bitcoin is up almost 100% in the last six months, beating chip giant Nvidia (NVDA), which is up around 88%, ether {{ETH}}, up 89%, and the S&P 500 (INX), which is up just 18%.  “If you’re investing and trading and not outperforming BTC, why bother?” Olszewicz said in his video. “Almost everything looks like junk against bitcoin.”  Bitcoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is also at a level not seen since the height of the 2021 bull market, at 79.02. It was last near this point in October 2021 when it hit 72. The RSI, created by J. Welles Wilder, is a momentum indicator that measures the speed and change of price movements.  A reading above 70 would suggest overbought conditions, indicating that an asset’s price has risen too quickly and may soon correct lower. However, the RSI is only an indicator and not a fool-proof predictor.  Bitcoin began the year with an RSI of 45.

42408531,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaJddT,1712810222,MarginFi Leader Resigns on Fiery Day for Major Solana Lender,"MarginFi’s longtime leader, Edgar Pavlovsky, resigned Wednesday following an internal dispute at the protocol's builder, mrgn.  The abrupt exit won’t impact MarginFi's borrow-and-lend functions, but it did spur $100 million in capital flight.  Edgar Pavlovsky, the CEO of the company building crypto borrow-and-lend platform MarginFi resigned Wednesday as internal fissures at the major Solana DeFi project erupted into public view.  “I don't agree with the way things have been done internally or externally,” Pavlovsky said in a resignation notice on X, formerly Twitter. MarginFi's own account called the departure of its co-founder “a function of internal operational disagreements and of his own personal reasons.""  The abrupt exit capped a fiery day for Solana's second-largest lending platform that saw allegations fly and tempers flare. Amidst the chaos, users pulled nearly $100 million from the platform, according to analytics site DeFiLlama – MarginFi's largest-ever day of withdrawals.  ""All products remain fully operational and are unaffected (and can not be affected) by this departure. The point of DeFi is that core contributors can walk away, and the protocol marches on,"" MarginFi said in a tweet.  MarginFi's meltdown comes after weeks of withdrawal function issues at the borrow-and-lend platform and months after it launched a points program that preceded a wave of growth-fueling incentivization loyalty schemes across Solana DeFi.  But while other protocols reward their points-earning users with a token, MarginFi hasn't, much to the anger of some of its users.  Oracle issues  In mid-March, a problem in MarginFi's price data sourcing ""oracle"" infrastructure had caused some users' withdrawal requests to fail to start when Solana's network congestion was still rising.  ""The stale Oracle issues currently impact withdrawals, not deposits, I think, so it's leading to some accusations from users who feel that MarginFi is just taking their deposits and not letting them withdraw,"" the builder of popular liquid staking service SolBlaze told CoinDesk in a Telegram message.  SolBlaze lodged its own accusations against MarginFi on Wednesday. The service rewards holders of its bSOL and BLZE tokens with more tokens, which are called emissions. Depositors of SolBlaze tokens on MarginFi also get these reward payouts, but via mrgn and MarginFi.  However, for at least eight days those payments through MarginFi had not been getting to bSOL and BLZE token owners, according to SolBlaze. This was due to a quirk in the way MarginFi handled earmarked tokens, but it was left unmonitored and with no communication to SolBlaze, which has since severed its business relationship with MarginFi.  ""The main problem was our lack of organizational execution,"" Pavlovsky told CoinDesk in a Telegram message sent hours before he announced his resignation.  Leadership transition  Pavlovsky's exit throws MarginFi's leadership into uncertainty. An employee of the New York City-centric project referred CoinDesk to MarginFi's statement.  ""We want to assure the community that the core contributors, the company, and our investors are actively engaged to ensure a smooth transition,"" the post read without saying who was taking over.  Kyle Samani, managing partner at Multicoin Capital, an investor in MarginFi, posted on X that he remains committed to the protocol and is not withdrawing anything.  One candidate may be MacBrennan Peet, another co-founder of MarginFi with a history of embracing online controversy, including releasing a video of himself shirtless and crowing ""wen token"" in December 2023.  ""Moving forward, I'll be a more authentic person online,"" he said in a tweet. Peet called his previous social media stunts and ""very intentionally controversial"" persona a ""growth-hacking"" strategy that ""largely worked"" to boost MarginFi's user base.  Growth hack or not, that persona also succeeded in making MarginFi its enemies in Solana DeFi. One of them was Solend, once the leading protocol for borrow-and-lend on Solana.  Moving to capitalize on its foe's weaknesses, Solend announced it would airdrop a token to MarginFi users who move their money to Solend and keep it there. At press time, the push hadn't yet led to a noticeable uptick in deposits on Solend, according to DeFillama.  On a day where MarginFi lost $80 million to withdrawals, the major borrow-and-lend platform Kamino saw $51 million in deposits, its third largest day of inflows ever.  Wen token?  From Mac's ""wen token"" shirtless meme video to the daily chants of ""wen token"" in MarginFi's Telegram channel, the protocol faces intense pressure to drop a new crypto asset to its user base.  ""People feel like they've been farmed for TVL without getting the airdrop that they would have expected from a points program,"" SolBlaze said.  On Wednesday MarginFi, MacBrennan and mrgn had little to reveal about when, or even if, it would launch a governance token that decentralizes its decision-making. Such an asset would theoretically give holders a vote in the operations of MarginFi. If it were airdropped to users it would likely provide a windfall to the thousands of points earners who have farmed MarginFi since July 2023.  ""The MRGN development team will carry on work towards full decentralization,"" a tweet read.  Next steps  The departure of Pavlovsky will not impact mtnDAO, a biannual month-long coworking event hosted in Salt Lake City by MarginFi and Cypher, said Cypher CEO Barrett Williams, a close friend of Pavlovsky.  ""I don't have next steps yet, but as mrgn's founder it's ultimately my failure that this happened, and like I've done for years, I'll reflect and evolve,"" Pavlovksy said in his resignation tweet, which came around three hours after SolBlaze's first accusation.  Less than an hour later, he was back: ""Okay, what should I build next.""",NEGATIVE,SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MINING | SOL | AIRDROP,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/04/11/marginfi-leader-resigns-on-fiery-day-for-major-solana-lender,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a4ccfb93f408b8a6d1ffbeff06d5376218284eeb-5184x2916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

IBIT has seen significant inflows since its launch, indicating strong demand for Bitcoin and potential for price growth. Historical data shows that Bitcoin has experienced significant price surges after previous halving events, suggesting a bullish market ahead. Investment Thesis In my view, the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ) is well-positioned for the upcoming Bitcoin halving, presenting a strong buy case. IBIT is an ETF (exchange-traded fund) which is designed to track the current price of Bitcoin. With the Bitcoin halving approaching, likely to be around April 20th , the daily Bitcoin supply created is expected to reduce from 900 to 450 BTC . This reduction is predicted to affect the supply-demand dynamics of Bitcoin, potentially increasing the price. When looking into the past, this prediction matches. Historical data concludes that after halving events, significant price surges are often observed, with Bitcoin rallying over 30% in the weeks leading up to halving events. Since the launch of IBIT in January of 2024, their year-to-date inflow has reached $3.2 billion . The obvious demand for Bitcoin, coupled with the historical gains from past halving events showcases the likely price increase to come. With some projections estimating Bitcoin's fair value could reach $148,000 post halving I believe IBIT presents a compelling investment opportunity as we approach the halving event. Background In order to understand why I think IBIT has such upside, it’s important to understand halving events. These events occur approximately every four years and are meant to reduce the number of Bitcoins generated per block by half. By doing so, the rate at which new Bitcoins are produced is decreased, therefore limiting supply. By limiting supply , this opens the possibility of an increase in price, assuming demand stays constant. The chart below demonstrates the already declining supply of Bitcoin globally, due to some Bitcoin that is purchased on exchanges being put into illiquid storage (sometimes called cold storage). Available Bitcoin Supply (Glassnode & Coinbase) As mentioned above, halving events have led to significant price increases. But to be more specific, substantial absolute gains were observed after the 2016 and 2020 halvings, attributed to factors like Brexit uncertainties and the pandemic-era low interest rate boom​​. This time, the introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs, such as IBIT, has added a new dimension to the market by providing institutional and retail investors (through normal brokerage and retirement accounts) with a regulated and accessible way for investors to invest in Bitcoin. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have been noted to alter the market dynamics in multiple ways, one being the increase in inflows to where they reach 5-7 times the daily new units of generated BTC. Since its launch, IBIT, among other Bitcoin ETFs like ARKB, GBTC, and FBTC have made their impact on the dynamics of the Bitcoin market by attracting substantial attention and investment. For example, Bitcoin's price action has seen an impressive growth of 137.6% over the last year, with Bitcoin moving up 56.29% YTD alone as of the time of this writing. Why IBIT To Play Bitcoin? IBIT vs. BTC Trading (Seeking Alpha) The power of IBIT is the way the ETF is designed, with the fund being over 99% allocated to Bitcoin. BlackRock ( BLK ), the fund's sponsor, has set the fund up as an open-ended fund so it redeems shares from the open market for cash by selling Bitcoin and giving the cash to investors. The S1 filing notes : The Trust issues and redeems Shares only in blocks of 40,000 or integral multiples thereof, based on the quantity of bitcoin attributable to each Share (net of accrued but unpaid remuneration due to the Sponsor (the “Sponsor’s Fee”) and any accrued but unpaid expenses or liabilities). A block of 40,000 Shares is called a “Basket.” -S1 Filing Many ETFs follow this style so that the funds trade close to their NAV (as does IBIT; we can see this with its price performance compared to Bitcoin). While many of the BTC ETFs have this mechanism in place, I like IBIT due to Blackrock's low fees (a sponsor fee of just 0.25%). This fee is, in fact, only 0.12% on the first $5 billion in AUM which means the blended fee is lower here. In essence, IBIT is a great way to play the Bitcoin run-up due to its accessibility in traditional trading accounts + its close performance to Bitcoin given the fund structure (and compared to Grayscale's Bitcoin fund ( GBTC )). How is BTC Doing Going Into The halving? I believe the current performance of Bitcoin (BTC) as it approaches the halving event is promising. As mentioned above, Bitcoin has experienced significant rallies following pre-halving price corrections. In the past, leading up to the halvings in 2012, 2016, and 2020, Bitcoin prices experienced large drops but then turned around near or after the halving event. For example, in 2012, there was a 50.78% price drop months before the halving, followed by a massive surge. Similar patterns were observed in 2016 and 2020. Heading into this halving, Bitcoin is up 56.29% YTD as I mentioned before, suggesting a potential for a bullish market ahead. Such trends indicate that, despite a possible upcoming correction, a rally post-halving is highly likely. To substantiate this, I believe it's important to look at where Bitcoin has been 16 days going into the halving. For this cycle, this is the best setup Bitcoin has seen going into the halving ever. Bitcoin, 16 days out, has always been down more (on a percentage basis from ATHs). I find this to be very bullish. BTC Performance 16 Days To Halving (Kaiko) Market observers have noted Bitcoin's tendency to rally significantly in the weeks leading up to the halving. Valuation Considering the increase in ETF inflows and expected supply reduction, the valuation of Bitcoin (BTC) points towards promising potential for growth. Initial conservative estimates set BTC's fair value at $74,600 , based on a monthly inflow of $1 billion into Bitcoin ETFs. However, recent trends have shown inflows exceeding this, with over $1 billion weekly, meaning that these estimates might be too low. In terms of inflows, IBIT quickly became one of the top five ETFs, reaching $3.2 billion shortly after launch, alongside Fidelity's Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC). These inflow results demonstrate the increasing demand for Bitcoin, suggesting a bullish market sentiment, supporting a higher BTC valuation, potentially reaching as high as $148,000 per coin according to some research estimates​​. Spot Bitcoin ETF Flows (The Block) Given the increase in inflows entering the Bitcoin ETFs, thus the increasing demand, along with the predicted price increases from post-halving and limited supply, the market could see valuation increases for Bitcoin and related ETFs like IBIT. Based on these numbers, this implies a 2.15x upside in the Bitcoin ETF (assuming that BTC was trading at $68,956 when this piece was written). Why I Think This Price Estimate Is Reasonable In previous halving cycles, Bitcoin rose anywhere from 320.9% in the 2020 cycle 250 days later, 78.7% higher in the 2016 cycle (after 250 days), and a whopping 760.5% upside in the 2012 cycle after only 250 days. This is impressive. In essence, if we take an average of these gains 250 days after the halving, we get an average gain of 386.7% gain in only 250 days. The gains I am arguing are possible post this halving is a 114.629% gain. While this gain is still impressive, this would be the second worst post halving gain since Bitcoin’s inception. Risks to Thesis The main risk that comes with investing in Bitcoin through IBIT, comes from regulatory pressures. For example, recent legal challenges have been imposed on cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase. In the SEC's lawsuit against Coinbase, the exchange was charged with operating as an unregistered securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency. A federal judge recently ruled against most of Coinbase's motion to dismiss the lawsuit, finding that the SEC had presented a plausible case for the exchange's operation as an unregistered entity. This ruling allows the lawsuit to proceed.​ In response, Coinbase has contested the SEC's jurisdiction, arguing that the digital assets on their platform fall outside the regulator's purview. This defense is the perfect example of the broader industry debate over the classification of cryptocurrencies as securities and the SEC's regulatory authority over them. Despite these challenges, some in the industry view these legal developments as potentially stabilizing over the long term, as they could lead to clearer regulations and standards for the cryptocurrency market​​. The reason this is a major risk to IBIT even though this ETF filed an S-1 when it went public is because Coinbase custodies the Bitcoin behind the fund, meaning that if Coinbase is forced to stop being an exchange, then custodying issues will arise. In short, I am not concerned about this. I wrote about Coinbase last month, and I believe that the exchange has a solid defense against the SEC. On top of this, other firms, such as Bank of New York Mellon, are now custodying Bitcoin as well, meaning that worse case there are other places for Blackrock’s fund to be placed. Takeaway As the Bitcoin halving event approaches, I believe IBIT emerges as a compelling opportunity. The ETF’s strong market performance, combined with the historical impact of halving events on Bitcoin's price, suggests a favorable outlook. The increase in ETF inflows, specifically into IBIT, represents the increase in demand for Bitcoin amongst investors. With increased investors dollars and demand in mind, the valuation of Bitcoin may even reach as high as $148,000 per coin by some estimates. This price increase post halving would prove to be conservative compared to other price increases post halving. Given these dynamics, IBIT represents a strong buy opportunity, with the halving event expected to result in significant upward pressure on Bitcoin's price, despite the ongoing regulatory uncertainties.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4683203-ibit-ishares-bitcoin-trust-etf-btc-supply-is-shrinking-crypto?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/25540766.jpeg

25535011,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=602551,1712797256,"Bitcoin 2 Months Through “Euphoria Wave,” How Long Was The Last One?","On-chain data shows Bitcoin has been going through a “euphoria wave” for two months. Here’s how long it was in this phase during the last bull run. Bitcoin Has Been In Euphoria Wave Phase According To Supply In Profit According to the latest weekly report from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the current BTC cycle is similar to the last one regarding the “Supply Profitability State.” This indicator is based on the “Percent Supply in Profit,” which keeps track of the percentage of the total circulating Bitcoin supply that’s currently carrying a profit. Related Reading: Dogecoin Slows Down: What Needs To Happen For New DOGE Highs? This metric works by going through the on-chain history of each coin in circulation to see the price at which it was last transferred. Assuming that this last transaction was the last point at which it changed hands, the price at its time would reflect the coin’s current cost basis. Naturally, if this cost basis is lower in value than the current spot price of the cryptocurrency, then the coin in question carries some net unrealized gain. The Percent Supply in Profit adds up all such coins and calculates what percentage of the supply they make up for. The supply Profitability State signals BTC’s current phase based on the market’s profitability status. The chart below shows the trend in this indicator over the past few years. Looks like the metric has been giving a green signal in recent weeks | Source: Glassnode's The Week Onchain - Week 15, 2024 In the chart, the analytics firm has highlighted three important lines for the Bitcoin Percent Supply in Profit. The middle line (colored in blue) represents the cumulative mean of the metric, while the other two signify +1 (green) and -1 (red) standard deviation (SD) from this mean. When the Bitcoin Percent Supply in Profit is above the +1SD (approximately 95% of the supply being in the green), the market may be considered to be in the euphoria or pre-euphoria phase. Similarly, the Supply Profitability State would indicate a bottom discovery phase for values less than -1SD. The zone between these two corresponds to the “bear/bull transition” phase. From the chart, it’s visible that during the last bull run, Bitcoin first saw a 1.5-month-long pre-euphoria wave, during which the metric tested the +1SD line. The asset followed up with a period of decline and consolidation, which put the Supply In Profit back under the +1 SD mark. Related Reading: Bitcoin Nears Two Important On-Chain Levels: What Happened Last Time Finally, the coin observed a sharp rally, broke past the +1SD barrier, and went on to achieve new all-time highs, which naturally set the Supply In Profit to 100%. Bitcoin seems to have witnessed a similar pattern this time around. A two-month-long pre-euphoria phase was followed by a drawdown, which has now been succeeded by a two-month-long euphoria wave during which the cryptocurrency has achieved new records. If the euphoria wave lasts for a period similar to the last bull run, then four or more months might still be left for this Bitcoin bull rally.

As the price continues to show red numbers, a top crypto analyst considers that ADA is “right where it should be.” Related Reading: ADA Price Ready To Soar As Cardano Network Hits New 88.6 Million Transaction Milestone Cardano Loses 10th Spot Against Telegram’s Toncoin Cardano’s recent spotlight has highlighted its disappointing price performance and lack of appeal for traders. Despite its technology and strong community, the ecosystem lacks the activity and demand of other chains like Solana. Recently, Charles Hoskinson defended the project, stating that “Cardano always wins,” referencing a poll ranking the best Layer-1 networks. Moreover, Hoskinson took another jab at Solana’s network problem after its recent transaction failure rate reached 75%. Nonetheless, on Tuesday, ADA lost its spot in the top ten cryptocurrencies after being flipped by Toncoin (TON). According to CoinGecko data, Cardano’s market capitalization of $20.1 billion was surpassed by TON’s $23.3 billion market cap. As a result, ADA’s spot as the 10th largest cryptocurrency by this metric was taken by TON. ADA drops to be the 11th biggest cryptocurrency by market cap. Source: CoinGecko Per CoinMarketCap data, ADA remains in the top ten cryptocurrencies, ranking ninth on the website’s list before being flipped. ADA Is “Where It Should Be” Last week, crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed that ADA’s whale activity was “experiencing a lull.” To the analyst, whether this was a signal of further price consolidation or a drop remained to be seen. Some believe that TON’s overtaking of Cardano’s place on the list highlights some of the ecosystem’s problems. Martinez reiterated his prediction made around the time Bitcoin registered its latest all-time high (ATH) of $73,373. At the time, the analyst considered that ADA resembled the pattern observed from 2018 to 2021. During the period observed by Martinez, Cardano’s token went through a long consolidation period, with the price hovering between $0.026 and $0.082. After breaking out of this resistance level, ADA’s price surged to $0.35 in the following weeks before continuing its upward trajectory to its ATH of $3.09. According to the analyst, if that fractal continued during the following weeks, investors should “anticipate ADA consolidating in the $0.55 to $0.80 range. This would be followed by a surge to the $1.7 support level. After another consolidation period, the stage would be set for the token’s price to “breakout to $5,” the analyst considered. Almost a month later, the analyst considers that “nothing has changed for Cardano.” Martinez reaffirmed the price consolidation between the $0.55-$0.80 range and subsequent breakout, as “ADA is exactly where it should be.” Despite the analyst’s optimistic forecast, ADA’s price of $0.5762 remains 81.5% below its 2021 ATH. At writing time, the token dropped 5.4% from the previous day. Additionally, its performance has decreased by 3.6% and 22.3% in the weekly and monthly timeframes. However, the token’s market activity has surged 6.6% in the last 24 hours, with a daily trading volume of $502.1 million.
