42400113,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAc22QM,1499378119,EU Securities Watchdog Extends Blockchain Task Force Mandate,"A distributed ledger task force convened by the European Union's top securities watchdog has been extended.  The supervisory body of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) renewed the task force during a meeting in May, according to newly published minutes. The task force was formed after the agency, in 2015, began to solicit information about the tech from stakeholders in a wide-ranging call for input.  Details about what the task force will do as part of its renewed mandate or how long for which it has been extended isn't exactly clear. But in statements in February, ESMA – which decided to not create new rules for the tech – said it planned to continue watching the space. The task force is likely to be the focal point for those observations.  ""ESMA will continue to monitor market developments around [distributed ledger technology] to assess whether a regulatory response may be needed,"" the agency said at the time.  The task force was first disclosed last year, with members drawn from ESMA's ranks as well as the European Central Bank and the European Commission.

42400114,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAc22SK,1499358637,National Science Foundation Awards $450k for Cryptocurrency Incentive Study,"A Princeton University researcher has received more than $400,000 in federal funding to study mechanism incentives and their applications to cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.  The study project, ""Duality-based tools for simple vs. optimal mechanism design and applications to cryptocurrency"", is being led by Seth Weinberg, an assistant professor of computer science at Princeton. The grant, worth $450,000, was awarded on 28th June by the National Science Foundation. The project is set to begin in September and will last until August 31, 2020, according to the NSF.  As the organization's website explains:  ""A secondary focus of this project is to apply these theoretical foundations to resolve cryptocurrency incentive issues arising within Bitcoin, an emerging cryptocurrency. While bitcoin has remained largely immune to traditional security breaches, numerous incentive issues have been discovered which could undermine its future security if not properly addressed.""  Though cryptocurrencies constitute only part of the research study – its primary focus is the design of algorithmic mechanisms and the theoretical incentives at play – its the latest instance of a project that involves the tech receiving federal backing.  In mid-2015, the NSF awarded $3m to the Initiative for Cryptocurrency and Contracts (IC3), a research effort involving academics from Cornell, the University of Maryland and the University of California Berkeley. The NSF has also moved to back cybersecurity-related research that involves blockchain.

The global financial messaging provider said in a press release today it has increased the number of companies that can act as validators for the proof-of-concept.  The list of banks includes a variety of institutions that have previously pursued blockchain initiatives, either on a collective basis or within individual projects. These include ABN Amro, Absa Bank, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan Chase, Standard Chartered and Westpac, to name a few.  The project, as previously reported by CoinDesk, aims to evaluate how the technology can improve the reconciliation process for international nostro costs. Nostro accounts are typically used by banks to store money internationally for the purpose of settling cross-border transactions.  ""This new group of banks allows us to greatly extend the scope of multi-lateral testing of the blockchain application and thus add considerable weight to the findings. We warmly welcome the new banks and look forward to their insights,"" Wim Raymaekers, Swift's head of banking markets, said in a statement.  As reported in April, Swift is using the Fabric blockchain implementation, developed by the Linux Foundation-backed Hyperledger project, as the technology basis for the proof-of-concept.

42400121,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAc22XF,1499347808,Investment Bank Affiliate Sells Shares for Cash in Blockchain Test,"An affiliate of French corporate investment bank Natixis has sold shares to investors through a blockchain platform backed by the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.  The affiliate, Natixis Asset Management, sold an undisclosed number of shares through FundsDLT, a platform developed in partnership between between Fundsquare, a subsidiary of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, professional services firm KPMG's Luxembourg office, and software provider InTech.  The platform, the firms involved announced this week, utilizes the tech to facilitate and streamline the selling of securities. The process involves a mobile app through which prospective buyers place a share subscription order. Those orders are transfered to the FundsDLT platform, with orders settling via its internal blockchain. Nodes, according to the firms involved, are operated by Natixis and other parties to the transactions.  Matthieu Duncan, Natixis' CEO, said in a statement:  ""Natixis Asset Management is delighted to have contributed to this pioneering first blockchain enabled trade via the FundsDLT platform. We believe the potential for blockchain technology to enhance distribution mechanisms in the asset management industry is very significant.""  The project is perhaps the most notable to date for Natixis, which is a member of the R3 distributed ledger consortium. Natixis was among the group of member-banks to back R3's $107m funding round earlier this year.  The investment bank has also taken part in a number of private-sector blockchain trials, including one focused on the oil trade and another more broadly on shipping finance.

42400128,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAc22d9,1499342405,A Former Politico Editor Is Using Ethereum to Help Fix Journalism,"When Tom McGeveran left Politico earlier this year, he had no idea he would end up helping a blockchain startup in its attempt to change the way reporters and their audiences interact.  Now that he's the co-founder of New York-based Civil, which is working to encode elements of the modern newsroom into smart contracts on the ethereum blockchain, McGeveran finds himself helping disrupt the industry he just left.  By writing the functions of various departments, including circulation, subscriptions, ad sales and marketing, into the self-executing code, Civil aims to cut out a middleman of a different sort: media bureaucracy.  If successful, the effort (which is planning an ICO this year), would break down every aspect of a newsroom into its most basic components and let individuals fulfill those functions with only limited managerial oversight.  McGeveran told CoinDesk:  ""We see in crypto economics the possibility of decentralizing this package, stripping it down to the relationship between readers and journalists/producers, reducing the cost base for these basic services and freeing it from incentives that match the interests of third parties but not citizens or readers or journalists.""  The vision  A white paper published last week divides journalism into three marketplaces that interact as a ""mesh"" of services that can be broken down into a series of core components.  Newsrooms enable coverage by identifying ""niche and local"" topics that audiences members, or ""citizens"", can either express interest in or not. ""Stations"" are monetization platforms that allow journalists to price their work ""however they want."" While ""fact-checking-as-a-service"" uses tokens to incentivize audience members to identify libel, plagiarism, errors and more.  To power the interlocking system of smart contracts, Civil intends to launch its own token that services several functions, including allowing access to content, voting on newsroom decisions and penalizing inaccuracy.  If successful, Civil founder Matthew Iles believes this token-driven workflow could dramatically cut down on the costs of setting up a news publication, resulting in more profitable articles being written for communities currently overlooked by mainstream media.  ""There's costs involved in the centralized business model that we don't think go towards the creation of valuable journalism,"" Iles told CoinDesk. ""And we think there an opportunity to create efficiencies in that business model that would enable journalism to exist where it currently can't.""  Industry support  To build this new kind of decentralized infrastructure, the startup is harnessing the experience of a number of industry heavyweights as advisers, including the former managing editor of the New York Post, Lauren Ramsby, and the editor-in-chief of local news site DNAinfo, John Ness.  Former NewYorker.com reporter Blake Eskin and CoinFund founder Jake Brukhman will also advise.  Prior to joining Civil, McGeveran and another advisor, Josh Benson, founded Capital New York, a firm acquired by Politico in 2013.  McGeveran and Benson left Politico in January to join their former colleague, Katherine Lehr to build an ""outlet"" for media projects that reimagine the industry.  McGeveran told CoinDesk:  ""That firm hasn't really had its coming out yet, but Civil is a big part of our work.""

42400122,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAc22YE,1499338822,UN Identity Tech Partner Integrates Blockchain Into Payments Platform,"A technology company involved in the UN's blockchain trials has expanded its work with the tech through its aid-focused payments platform.  As reported by CoinDesk, IrisGuard's technology was utilized by the UN to verify the identity of refugees in Jordan who, as part of the test, were awarded financial aid through an ethereum-based payment platform. Late last month, IrisGuard announced that its EyePay platform, aimed at facilitating trusted payments, had been upgraded to interface with blockchain-based networks more easily like the one deployed in the Jordan test.  According to a release from IrisGuard, the company has helped the UN enroll over 2.3 million refugees from Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq, Egypt and Syria using EyePay.  Imad Malhas, the company's founder and CEO, said in a statement:  ""IrisGuard is proud of its partnerships with United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, United Nations World Food Programme (WFP), The United Nations Children's Fund, International Organization for Migration and all UN agencies and NGO's trying to make a sustainable difference in the lives of impoverished, undocumented and defenseless refugees. We hope to continue doing our part in realizing a fair and dignified distribution system for the world's unbanked populations.""  As previously reported by CoinDesk, Jordan has served as a testing ground for the UN's work with blockchain, though the international organization has launched other technology-driven initiatives in the region, including others with IrisGuard itself.  According to data from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), as of 2016, there are 720,812 refugees and asylum seekers in the country.

42400111,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAc22PN,1499335235,ZhongAn Reveals Blockchain Product Details in Draft IPO Filing,"China's first online-only insurer ZhongAn filed for an initial public offering (IPO) on June 30, revealing new details about its blockchain development in the process.  According to the draft filing to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, ZhongAn Technology, a wholly owned subsidiary of ZhongAn Insurance, has developed a blockchain protocol called Ann-chain, which serves as its foundation for building applications. A separate platform, called Ann-router, is further described as a blockchain network component ""intended to link isomorphic and heterogeneous blockchains.""  Formed to focus on research and development of financial technology, ZhongAn Technology launched a series blockchain applications last year designed for distributed data storage. The latest, Ti-Packet, launched in May 2017 and described as a blockchain-based signing system, appears to have been adopted in a use case aimed at tracking chicken farming on a blockchain.  This technology development has also coincided with broader work with industry stakeholders.  In May this year, under an initiative led by China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, ZhongAn Technology and a dozen other active blockchain developers drafted a document called the ""Blockchain Reference Architecture"" – an attempt to provide a standard for blockchain protocol development in China. The final version of the agreement was announced by the China Electronics Technology Standardization Academy in an industry summit, during which the Ann-chain and four other blockchain protocols passed the first batch of testing under such standardization.  Also notable in the filing is the size of ZhongAn's research and development team, which consists of 862 technicians and engineers. As of the end of 2016, it had received over $30m in investment in 2016.  The number of staff that focus on blockchain-related projects was not disclosed.

42400130,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAc22f7,1499331141,Former Bain Manager Launches $50 Million Bitcoin and Ethereum Fund,"Some of the wealthiest families in Latin America now have access to a new way to invest, thanks in part to a former senior manager at consulting firm Bain & Company.  Announced today, the newly formed Crypto Assets Fund, co-founded by former senior manager at Bain, Roberto Ponce Romay, is helping to raise $50m with the purpose of buying cryptocurrencies for family offices. Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, Crypto Assets Fund (CAF) will invest directly in bitcoin, ether, zcash, ripple, litecoin and dash.  The first tranche of the fund, estimated to be valued about $10m, is in the final stages of closing, and is expected to be announced by the end of this month.  In interview, Romay explained that the purpose of the fund was two-fold. First, it was designed to give investors in some of Latin America’s more unstable economies a new way to hedge their investments, and second, it was meant to provide the opportunity to safely learn about these new stores of value for possible future investments.  According to Romay, as the fund's investors are becoming increasingly familiar with the crypto-asset class, the CAF could eventually raise new funds that also include tokens sold as part of initial coin offerings, or ICOs.  ""This fund is investor driven,"" said Romay, who is now the director of investment banking boutique, Invermaster. ""It is a simple strategy to give access.""  He added:  ""The [investors] wanted to be exposed.""  Investment documents provided to CoinDesk further reveal details about how the British Virgin Islands fund intends to invest capital provided by its limited partners.  Fund co-founders, including the vice president of bitcoin payments startup Ripio, David Garcia, and, ARG Capital partner Miguel Iribarne, are raising the cash from accredited family office investors in Argentina, Costa Rica and other Latin American nations.  The service is designed to give new crypto-asset investors exposure to bitcoin and ether without taking on the added risk of regulatory and tax compliance and storage. No fee is being charged for the service, but 30% of the carried interest will be collected by the fund based on certain conditions.  At the time of launch, the funds are expected to be held by Switzerland-based Xapo, with over-the-counter trading services provided by B2C2 OTC, an electronic market maker and a UK FCA appointed representative. The fund expects to provide broker funding via Silvergate Bank, according to its investor documents, though after this article was published the bank informed CoinDesk it does not currently count the Fund as a client.  While investors who put up a minimum of $2.5m will be allowed to hold their funds for the maximum period of five years, most investors will gain access to their 180 days after the next bitcoin halving in 2020, when the reward to mine bitcoin will automatically be reduced.  Half of all initial funds raised will be invested in bitcoin, with the other half divided between the remaining cryptocurrencies. But future funds could include new assets and other investors. ""We are mainly targeting family offices in Latin America,"" said Garcia. ""But there are other players interested in the fund, because the fund strategy also fits with what they’re looking for.""  Innovative wealth  While bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were originally heralded as new ways for the unbanked populations of developing countries to participate in the global economy, that has been changing in recent years.  As early use cases including remittances were targeted largely at workers looking to send money home, this latest development shows how services are now being aimed at the wealthy. CoinDesk first reported on this push by family offices into the cryptocurrency space last March.  Now, based on previous growth trajectories of CAF’s crypto-assets, the fund lists a minimum target return of 26% per year for three years with an ""expected"" target return of 71%.  But Garcia said Latin American family investors are looking for more than just a new way to make money. Depending on the nation, they are also looking for a way to hedge against less stable fiat currencies.  He explained:  ""Storing their savings in the local currency is not a smart option.""  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Ripple, Xapo and ZECC (developer of zcash).  Editor's note: This article was updated to clarify that B2C2 OTC is a UK FCA appointed representative.
