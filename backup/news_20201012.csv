PwC economists forecast a tipping point in 2025 if blockchain technologies are adopted at scale across the world, and expect blockchain applications to boost global gross domestic product (GDP) by $1.76 trillion, (1.4% of global GDP) by 2030.  According to the report, blockchain will make the biggest impact on Asia’s economy with China, India and Japan driving adoption in the region.  China stands to gain the highest potential net benefit at $440 billion, with the U.S. following at $407 billion.  Germany, Japan, U.K., India and France are each estimated to benefit by more than $50 billion in the same period.  The report identified five key application areas of blockchain with potential to generate economic value: product tracking and tracing ($962 billion), financial services and payments ($433 billion), identity security and credentials ($224 billion), contracts and dispute resolution ($73 billion), customer engagement and reward programs ($54 billion).  Public administration, education and health care sectors will benefit the most ($574 billion increase by 2030) by “capitalizing on the efficiencies blockchain brings to the world of identity and credentials,” the report said.  A survey conducted as part of the report revealed 61% of CEOs across the world are placing digital transformation of core business operations and processes among their top three priorities.  “Serious activity around blockchain is cutting through every industry across the globe right now,” Steve Davies, global Blockchain leader at PwC, said in the report.

Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $11,186-$11,598  BTC is above its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bullish signal for market technicians.    After a flat weekend that saw the world’s oldest cryptocurrency stick to a tight $11,300-$11,400 range, bitcoin’s price jumped Monday as high as $11,598 before settling to $11,552 as of press time.      Read More: Bitcoin and Ether Rally After Grayscale’s ETH Trust Becomes SEC-Reporting      In its weekly investor note, quant trading firm QCP Capital put bitcoin's technical support at $10,500, with any point above positive for the overall market due to payments firm Square buying $50 million in bitcoin. It has stayed above that level comfortably since Oct. 2.      ”Last week Square's purchase put a nice floor in BTC right at the key trendline and 10,500 level, with their average purchase price being $10,617 for 4,709 BTC,” the QCP note read. “Square's purchase and effective lobbying of other corporate treasury desks through their white paper will give people confidence that a five-digit BTC price will be sustainable.”      On the macroeconomic front, global stock markets are anxiously awaiting further economic stimulus in the face of an increasing number of coronavirus cases, saidRupert Douglas, head of institutional sales for broker Koine. Equities traders want another round of stimulus as well as a weaker dollar, which supports gold, silver and bitcoin, too, he added.      Indeed, since Sept. 25, the U.S. Dollar Index, a measure of a basket of fiat currencies versus the greenback, has been flat, in the red 0.01% Monday at press time.      “Macroeconomic news and markets have been mostly positive across the globe, with equities up 2%-3% last week,” said Jason Lau, chief operating officer for cryptocurrency exchange OKCoin. He also noted that funding rates have been mostly positive the past three days, indicating traders are mostly paying for margin to go long in the bitcoin market.      “Positive funding rates in the BTC futures markets and recent large corporate purchases, for example Square, have also increased short term bullish sentiment in line with traditional markets leading into year end,” Lau added.

Despite a mostly bullish run for ether to start October, options traders are less interested in placing bets on Deribit, which is the largest ether options venue. Vishal Shah, an options trader and founder of derivatives exchange Alpha5, says a decline in DeFi interest this month may be the culprit for open interest dipping. “I think, without over-analyzing it, DeFi has fizzled a touch, naturally reducing the need for ETH optionality on the margin,” he said.

Accounting for wide swaths of fundamentally different potential digital currency end users (from the rural unbanked to Wall Street's financial giants), the proposal seeks to game out every use case for a U.S. CBDC.  For example, one pilot envisions the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, which oversees the trillion-dollar plumbing undergirding U.S capital markets, testing atomic settlement procedures for tokenized cash and tokenized securities.  Another proposal would seek to “technologically” prove that mobile wallets could comply with stringent federal banking laws even in rural and unbanked communities. Additionally, it would attempt to “functionally” prove that digital wallets are better alternatives to those communities’ existing financial infrastructure.  Each situation gets a ""current state,"" a hypothetical ""future state"" and an accompanying CBDC pilot proposal to highlight specific considerations.  None of the proposals are actually in motion yet. Such a move would come from the U.S. Federal Reserve. Stakeholders there have made clear that while a digital dollar is being discussed, it is far from a done deal.  Nonetheless, digital dollar proponents said the CBDC pilots will help prompt more nuanced discussions about digital currency's specific challenges.

42432905,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO27Fh,1602531952,How HBCUs Are Prepping Black Students for Blockchain Careers,"Dozens of historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) are exploring the next phase of decentralized technologies in a bid to put Black students at the forefront of new blockchain protocols.      “These schools see it as a way to participate in Web 3.0,” said Tonya Evans, chairperson of the MakerDAO Foundation and visiting professor at Penn State’s Dickinson Law School. “We were not participating in the dot-com era. Most of the Black community didn’t know about it at the time.”    This story is part of the CoinDesk U series about blockchain at universities. See our ranking of U.S. universities here.    With many programs being only a couple years old, few schools have dedicated blockchain courses, even as students from blockchain groups have started to teach themselves. But efforts are mounting, according to educators contacted by CoinDesk, with many universities looking to deepen their relationships with the crypto industry.      “On the East Coast, certain majority-white colleges do this with their spare time anyway,” said Ryan Cooper, a graduate of Bowie State University who started the blockchain group at Bowie. “At HBCUs, you have to incentivize this.”      For instance, blockchain will likely remain just a part of courses at Howard University and not become a full-blown major “until there is a killer research rationale for doing so,” said Todd Shurn, a professor of computer science at Howard University.      Read more: Looking for a Job in Crypto? Here Are 5 Skills You Need      Morgan State’s FinTech Center started a blockchain group in 2019 and had a multimillion-dollar investment from Ripple in February of that year. The school teaches a blockchain fundamentals course but is still a few years away from a certification program, said Judith Schnidman, the FinTech Center’s program coordinator. Morgan State has taught the course three times, and students at the end of the course have to create a decentralized application on Ethereum.      “We’d like every university to have a blockchain major,” Schnidman said. “We want students to graduate with enough skills to break into this field.” The university is also in the process of creating a post-secondary certification, which can be done as a minor or a focus in the school’s MBA program.    Inter-campus efforts    Several universities are talking about collaborating to create a major, Schnidman added.      “The whole world is different because of online,” she said. “Even before the whole COVID thing, we were talking about doing a multi-university, multi-disciplinary blockchain major.”      Last year at the HBCU Blockchain Curriculum Development Institute, Morgan State brought 45 faculty from roughly 30 universities who had to submit course proposals to teach new courses or modify a course to include blockchain education. The winners were invited to New Orleans for a three-day working conference to turn their proposals into courses, one of whom was a genetics professor who wanted to incorporate blockchain into his genome projects, Schnidman said.      While Morgan State already offers a class, the university would have to make many decisions about which blockchains to include before creating a blockchain major, said Ali Emdad, associate dean of the Graves Business School at Morgan State. At the moment, the market is fragmented.    Corporate engagement    Morgan State’s most recent endeavor is a partnership with Binance US, enrolling 42 students in a crypto trading program where the exchange gave each student $200 in crypto to trade. The students started the challenge on Sept. 14 and it will end on Nov. 8, and the student who makes the most from trading will give a presentation at the end of the challenge about his or her strategies.      “You can be anywhere you want and work at any hour you want,” Emdad said. “The goal is to inform and educate our students on an area of fintech that is changing very fast.”      Emdad said he sees the project serving as a focus group for Binance US and an opportunity for students to learn crypto trading and maybe join a crypto exchange or crypto startup in the future. Since the trading resembles what goes on in traditional markets, Emdad also said the challenge may be wrapped into future finance courses at Morgan State.    Blockchain, cyber or robotics?    One of the current barriers to creating blockchain programs at HBCUs is a lack of funding.      “There are so many technologies that have the potential for impact and they’re competing for space in these student’s heads,” said Shurn, the professor at Howard. “It’s tough particularly in COVID times because budgets are even tighter than they were. … Do you add a blockchain course or a cybersecurity course?”      At Howard, blockchain plays a large role in the intro to engineering class and is a part of the senior project for computer science majors at the school, Shurn said. The program is split between computer science and business at Howard, with the computer science department focusing more on coding and consensus algorithms while the business department focuses more on blockchain workflows and crypto trading.      Read more: The Best Blockchain University Programs Actually Pay Students to Learn      “We’re more interested in blockchain and blockchain applications then we are in crypto,” Shurn said. “That isn’t as relevant to us as writing code behind a smart contract.”      Howard was in the middle of applying for grants from fintech companies and fintech accelerators before the pandemic hit, Shurn said, and the university was going to put on a blockchain event that would have involved stakeholders who could have helped fund the blockchain program at the school.      “Momentum for blockchain at Howard won’t really occur until there is some investment by a third party in a collaborative project,” Shurn said. “It could be IBM, it could be a startup, but it would have to be some major collaboration between some funded source and the university.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING | BNB,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/10/12/how-hbcus-are-prepping-black-students-for-blockchain-careers,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a94c1c617873186dc9e1e02aec3f862d8405152a-2400x2132.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432904,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO27Dh,1602530560,Decentralized Governance in the Wild – Lessons From the KuCoin Hack,"Blockchain-based networks provide a unique and unprecedented opportunity to experiment with new forms of organization – both organization of information and software processes as well as governing human action. But nobody ever said creating new forms of organization would be easy, or glitch-free.      When a group of enthusiastic entrepreneurs or developers design a new blockchain-based network – figuring out the consensus mechanisms, the economic logic and the governance – it’s difficult to predict how their encoded schemes will function once released into the wild. A blockchain isn’t just a collection of software processes interacting according to preprogrammed logic. It’s a system embedded in the world of humans, businesses and governments, which is fiendishly diverse and constantly evolving.    Ben Goertzel is founder and CEO of SingularityNET, a blockchain-based AI marketplace project.    Once a network is launched, the consequences of the inevitable mismatches between the real world and the network’s logic become apparent. And, assuming the network has some capability for self-modification and growth built into it, one also has the chance to improve and adapt.      For me and the other leaders of the SingularityNET blockchain-based AI network, the KuCoin hack that occurred on Sept. 25 provided an opportunity to re-evaluate the assumptions underlying some of our governance mechanisms, and think about how they might be augmented for superior functioning in future situations. Specifically, the attack led us to think hard about how liquid democracy mechanisms might be used to enable emergency response that is decentralized and democratic and also rapid.    Confronting KuCoin    In the recent security breach (“hack”) of KuCoin, a centralized token exchange, approximately $150 million worth of various ERC-20 tokens were transferred out of the exchange fraudulently. Among the stolen coins were 43 million AGI tokens, corresponding to the SingularityNET project I co-founded in 2017 and currently lead, equivalent in value to around $2 million, or close to 5% of the total current market cap.      This event was entirely isolated to the KuCoin exchange and did not affect the security of our platform or any of our decentralized apps (dapps). But still, it seriously affected a reasonably significant subset of our community.      A number of other blockchain-based networks similarly affected by this security breach chose to use centralized control mechanisms built into their smart contracts to rapidly pause trading of their tokens, and then hard-fork their token smart contracts, thus eliminating or reducing the hacker’s ability to profit from their theft.    A centralized 'off switch' or a centrally coordinated hard fork seemed against the decentralized ethos    We very seriously discussed this option but weren’t so certain it was the right path. Making a centralized decision to hard fork seemed against the decentralized ethos of the project, and setting the precedent of hard-forking in response to hacks on exchanges or other third-party repositories seemed undesirable.      Also, we quickly realized that if we were going to hard fork, we would need to come to this decision in a democratic way rather than purely as a centralized foundation decision.      With this in mind, we began planning an AGI Hard Fork Voting event, to solicit community input regarding whether a hard-fork was an appropriate response to the KuCoin hack.      While these preparations were underway, however, we discussed the situation further with KuCoin, which assured us that their insurance policy would recompense stolen tokens. At the same time, we observed the hacker liquidating a significant fraction of the stolen tokens – thus eliminating much of the value of a hard fork.      Ultimately we decided not to hard-fork the AGI token smart contract or take any other drastic action. Reaction in our community was mixed. Folks whose KuCoin accounts were frozen were impatient to get their AGI tokens out. Based on conversation happening within our Telegram community, many token-holders were pleased with the strict adherence to decentralized principles. A centralized “off switch” or a centrally coordinated hard fork seemed against the decentralized ethos within which most current blockchain-based networks were founded.      See also: Compound Extends DeFi Ethos to Itself, Launches Governance Token    Streamlining decentralized democratic governance    The KuCoin hack highlights the interesting and problematic nature of the intersection between democratic governance and rapid emergency response.      It clearly would have been possible to respond more quickly – and execute a hard-fork before significant liquidation of the stolen tokens occurred – had we made a strong and rapid centralized decision, as some other blockchain-based projects did.      But there might well arise future situations where rapid action of similar magnitude is required, and it would be desirable to have a way to respond effectively without sacrificing democracy or inclusiveness.      One theoretical approach to achieving this end would be to introduce a rapid response voting mechanism so that one is always poised to launch a vote immediately. This is perfectly feasible technically, but problematic socially. In actual, human fact, the members of the voting community will not always be available on short notice.      Another option would be to formulate, and have the community approve by vote, a set of guidelines specifying the circumstances under which the SingularityNET Foundation leadership should take drastic emergency action in the absence of a vote.      Obviously, leaders of democratic national governments have the ability to achieve such powers via declaring “state of emergency."" However, these mechanisms are complicated to get right and, as history shows, are highly subject to abuse.      After more consideration we arrived at the somewhat obvious conclusion that the best solution to effective, democratic and decentralized emergency response is most likely liquid democracy.      See also: Jake Yocom-Piatt – It’s Time to Walk-the-Talk on Decentralized Governance    Liquid democracy    Liquid democracy is when voters delegate their votes to various other parties in a flexible way, rather than voting directly or appointing representatives for everyone.      Just as smart contracts allow value transactions and persistent economic and other formal relationships to be scripted in flexible and automated ways, similarly liquid democracy allows delegation of voting power to be scripted according to arbitrary logic.      In the domain of emergency response, liquid democracy could work as follows: Each participant in the network could nominate a handful of network participants as “emergency delegates,” and specify that, if a network emergency occurs and a rapid vote is needed, any one of these emergency delegates should be considered able to submit their vote for them. When a network participant votes on an emergency matter, then, their vote counts not only for themselves but for anyone else who has nominated them as an emergency delegate.      Numerous software implementations of liquid democracy have been created, for instance the Catalyst system within the Cardano blockchain framework is used for liquid democracy-based allocation of development funds.      Adapting liquid-democracy to serve emergency response would require a nontrivial amount of work. But it is something we are giving serious consideration in the SingularityNET community, especially since we are currently planning to shift SingularityNET from an Ethereum-based to a multi-chain infrastructure, and in this context port a large fraction of SingularityNET’s current ERC-20 tokens to corresponding Cardano-based tokens.      The slowness of traditional, non-liquid democracy is inadequate for emergency response. On the other hand, centralized response mechanisms like many other blockchain networks utilized to cope with the KuCoin hack are going to be decreasingly viable as these networks gain traction and become more and more truly decentralize.      This is why agile software development methodology exists, and it’s why the design of blockchain-based networks needs to be agile as well and get progressively adapted based on the experience of releasing these networks into the wild.

42432903,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO279h,1602525197,"Amid Confusion About Rules, Indian Crypto Community Pushes for Regulatory Sandbox","In the seven months since India’s top court allowed banks to legally service crypto platforms, users and trade volumes at local exchanges have increased. But regulators have said little about the rules for crypto trading.      Confusion can be detrimental to market growth. So to introduce more clarity, some in the Indian crypto community are pitching a way to let platforms stay active but in a cordoned part of the market, supervised by the regulators - otherwise known as a sandbox approach.      Initiated by crypto exchange BuyUCoin, the sandbox proposes a regulatory framework to bring crypto assets under existing regulations while also setting up a supervised space for startups to develop in the sector. The proposal also involves developing an open-source interface to track crypto transactions and manage anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) compliance.      The proposed interface would pool information from exchanges and providers, and funnel it to regulators and governing councils via an application programming interface, or API.      The draft policy and API white paper released on Oct. 10 draws parallels to approaches used by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the U.K. and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). The framework document notes that even though the Indian central bank has operational sandboxes for retail payments and fintech platforms, cryptocurrencies have been kept off the playground.    Roller-coaster regulations    India’s crypto regulation has been a bit of a roller coaster. Amid a fledgling market in 2018, the central bank, Reserve Bank of India, banned banks from servicing crypto businesses. After almost two years of restrictions and protracted legal proceedings, the nation’s Supreme Court overturned the restriction in March this year.      Rumors of another crypto trading ban made the rounds in September, but no such policy was announced.      Shivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUCoin, said the idea for a sandbox became relevant after the RBI ban was overturned. According to Thakral, regulations are crucial for the Indian crypto market to protect users from recurring instances of fraudulent activity.      Read more: Investors Flock to India’s DeFi Scene Months After Central Bank Ban Overturned      Compared to the international market, Indian users “still lack in data security as well as personal wallet security,” said Thakral. BuyUCoin’s document also notes that a missing regulatory framework keeps users from reporting legitimate crypto earnings for tax purposes and limits investor protections, discouraging money from flowing into the market.      The proposed regulations hope to address this by involving banks in the customer vetting process, creating a supervised sandbox for startups in the sector and convincing the government to create a dedicated regulatory body for digital assets.    ‘Helping guide’    Ashish Bansal, director of global application and development tech at GSK, is one of the contributors to the proposal.      “Though the government is still quite skeptical about all these technologies, they need some organization, some private players or some association to kind of come up with these kinds of documents,” such as research reports or forums, he said.      The proposed sandbox approach could help bring some clarity to India’s regulatory space. The transaction-reporting framework proposed in the white paper also said that crypto exchanges and service providers could use the API to examine and report suspicious transactions to authorities in real-time.      Even though most crypto exchanges claim to follow KYC guidelines similar to the banks, blockchain analytics and tracing services like Chainalaysis and Elliptic have not yet gained traction.

While he expects these services to grow in popularity in the coming years, he said the requests exchanges currently receive from law enforcement haven’t yet required the use of sophisticated blockchain tracing.      Even though UnoCoin, among other exchanges, reported a jump in users and trade volumes after the banking restrictions were relaxed, Vishwanath said a comparison of leading global exchanges and Indian exchanges shows local volumes remain small overall.      “Uncertainty is … actually the reason why we see [less volume] from India,” said Vishwanath, alluding to the lack of a clear regulatory roadmap from the authorities.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Jaspreet Kalra,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/10/12/amid-confusion-about-rules-indian-crypto-community-pushes-for-regulatory-sandbox,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/08d4b9affdd7fa7adf647201c35785b976703ca3-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432910,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO27Ph,1602521148,"Blockchain Bites: Bitcoin on Ethereum – The Whos, Whats and Whys","Since January, over $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin has been tokenized into ERC-20 tokens to use in the emerging decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem on Ethereum. These DeFi applications offer an increasingly large array of potential use cases for bitcoin investors looking for alternative ways to issue loans or make trades on new exchange platforms.      Tokenizing bitcoin serves as a bridge between these two leading cryptocurrency communities and an important step forward for traders and investors taking advantage of the features offered by both blockchains. Through tokenized bitcoin projects, the powerful monetary properties of bitcoin can be leveraged in the ever-growing collection of Ethereum-based cryptocurrency applications.    CoinDesk is preparing for the invest: ethereum economy virtual event on Oct. 14 with a special series of newsletters focused on Ethereum's past, present and future. Every day until the event the team behind Blockchain Bites will dive into an aspect of Ethereum that excites or confuses us. Today's intro is written by CoinDesk reporter Zack Voell.    Tokenized bitcoin also revives an age-old discussion on the merits of decentralization versus convenience. Some projects like Thesis’ tBTC project prioritizes decentralization while others, like the industry-leading wrapped bitcoin (WBTC) project by BitGo emphasizes convenience through a central custodian for all tokenized coins.      To date, seven different projects offer bitcoin tokenization services, and that list is likely to grow along with demand for more bitcoin-backed ERC-20 tokens. As the amount of tokenized bitcoin grows, the importance of each project’s security and reliability becomes even more important as does the continued development of Ethereum-based applications that pique the interest of tokenized bitcoin holders.      It’s a topic of conversation likely to be covered by CoinList and BitGo representatives when speaking on the virtual panel Unlocked: BTC on Eth: Having Your Cake and Eating It, Too at invest: ethereum economy this coming Wednesday.    Featured panel    The Fees Are Too Damn High: DeFi Pushes Ethereum to Its Limit Ethereum has delivered many mind-boggling innovations – some by design, others out of necessity. With DeFi pushing the ecosystem, existing infrastructure is being maxed out. Can Eth 2.0 address these pain points? Is this the opportunity for so-called ""Eth Killers""?      MakerDAO’s Rune Christensen will assess this critical fork in the road along with representatives from NEAR Protocol and Framework Ventures at invest: ethereum economy. Tune into “The Fees Are Too Damn High: DeFi Pushes Ethereum to Its Limit,” on Oct. 14 starting at 9:30 a.m. ET.    Ethereum 101    To the surprise of many, bitcoin has been a breakout star in Ethereum’s decentralized finance (DeFi) moment. Taking the form of wrapped or tokenized bitcoin, the digital asset takes the best of both blockchains – bitcoin’s price value and brand along with Ethereum’s programmability – into one highly in-demand token.      CoinDesk tech reporter Will Foxley breaks down the mechanics behind these tokenized versions as well as the reasons investors would want to trade representations of BTC on a competing blockchain.    Why use tokenized BTC?    What bitcoin on Ethereum does is simple: It provides liquidity for growing decentralized exchanges (DEX), such as Uniswap. Bitcoin’s current market cap is five times larger than the second largest cryptocurrency, ether (ETH). That money can be put to use making more money.      Tokenized bitcoin allows investors to bring large amounts of value over to the Ethereum network and its young DEX market in a few clicks.      DeFi is considered vastly immature when compared to traditional or centralized exchange (CEX) markets. This can be seen in the large price spreads between orders on exchange books between different DeFi markets.      Price differences on markets can be exploited by traders in what is called arbitrage opportunities.      Wrapped bitcoin is often the asset of choice for investors seeking arbitrage. Bitcoin packs a large punch in terms of price value. More money on DeFi trading platforms makes the markets themselves stronger as additional buying and selling options are presented.      But tokenizing bitcoin isn’t without risks, particularly software risk. Investors who want exposure to bitcoin’s liquidity pay higher interest rates to cover the risk of losing an asset in addition to getting exposure to the first cryptocurrencies liquidity.      Security of bitcoin investments For tokenized bitcoin, security boils down to the type of custodianship and if the investment is collateralized. Three major models exist: a centralized firm like BitGo; a smart contract system with collateral, such as tBTC; or a complete, synthetic-asset backing employed by sBTC.      BitGo’s centralized model requires users to give the custodian BTC to receive an ERC-20 token-equivalent of BTC in return. That ERC-20 can then be sold on secondary markets or plugged into a DeFi application to earn yield.      Keep Network’s tBTC, which launched last month, is similar to WBTC but replaces the centralized BitGo model with a network of nodes, wallets and smart contracts. This network aims at bringing more decentralization to BitGo’s process by allowing both parties – the bitcoin depositor and custodian – to interact trustlessly through software.      A few features make this possible, such as the bitcoin depositors being able to choose who holds their bitcoin and a 150% security bond (held in ETH) pledged by the custodians on the off-chance they run to the hills with the deposits.      Ren’s rBTC works in a similar manner to tBTC’s node network by having the Ren Virtual Machine, RenVM, act as a trustless agent between the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains.      Lastly, sBTC is an ERC-20 version of bitcoin. But this time it’s backed by another token, the Synthetix Network Token (SNX). Each sBTC is not backed by BTC, but 800% of a BTC’s value in SNX, the token for minting synthetic assets (Syns) on the Synthetix DEX.      The future of tokenized assets The wild success of BitGo’s WBTC and WETH (wrapped ether) may lead to more constructions of other coin holdings. Ben Chan, CTO at WBTC co-creator BitGo, told Coindesk in August that the firm was looking at wrapping other cryptocurrencies.      WBTC’s 2020 success has largely been thanks to DeFi, he said.      “What we’ve seen this year is that WBTC traction has been largely thanks to the highly composable DeFi industry,” Chan said.    The ledger    CoinDesk Chief Content Officer Michael Casey took on the theme of wrapped bitcoin in his weekly newsletter, Money Reimagined, last June. According to Casey, tokenized bitcoins bring not only value and legitimacy to a burgeoning decentralized financial ecosystem, but also security.      Likewise, Ethereum provides a clear path towards returns for tokenized bitcoin users, willing to take on extra risk.    DeFi double act    Tensions between the Bitcoin and Ethereum tribes have been stirred by a trend outsiders might see as a sign of harmony. Beneath the rivalry that plays out primarily on Crypto Twitter, the bitcoin-on-Ethereum trend says more about complementarity than competition.      The growth of tokenized representations of BTC highlights that bitcoin is the crypto universe’s reserve asset and that Ethereum’s burgeoning “DeFi” ecosystem is crypto’s go-to platform for generating credit and facilitating fluid exchange.      Real-world parallels This trend captures the early beginnings of a new, decentralized global financial system. An analogy: Bitcoin is the dollar, and Ethereum is SWIFT, the international network that coordinates cross-border payments among banks. (Since Ethereum is trying to do much more than payments, we could also cite a number of other organizations in this analogy, such as the International Swaps and Derivatives Association or the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation.)      So, let’s dismiss claims like those of Ethhub.io co-founder Anthony Sassano. He argued that because bitcoin token transactions on Ethereum deny miners fees they would otherwise receive on the bitcoin chain, bitcoin is becoming a “second-class citizen” to ether. You’d hardly expect people in countries where dollars are preferred to the local currency to think of the former as second class. And just as the U.S. benefits from overseas demand for dollars – via seigniorage or interest-free loans – bitcoin holders benefit from its sought-after liquidity and collateral value in the Ethereum ecosystem, where it lets them extract premium interest.      Still, to declare bitcoin the winner based on its appeal as a reserve asset is to compare apples to oranges. Ether is increasingly viewed not as a payment or store-of-value currency but for what it was intended: as a commodity that fuels the decentralized computing network orchestrating its smart contracts.      That network now sustains its financial system, a decentralized microcosm of the massive traditional one. It takes tokenized versions of the underlying currencies that users most value (whether bitcoin or fiat) and provides disintermediated mechanisms for lending or borrowing them or for creating decentralized derivative or insurance contracts. What’s emerging, albeit in a form too volatile for traditional institutions, is a multifaceted, market for managing and trading in risk.      This system is being fueled by a global innovation and development pool bigger than Bitcoin’s. As of June of last year, there were 1,243 full-time developers working on Ethereum compared with 319 working on Bitcoin Core, according to a report by Electric Capital. While that work is spread across multiple projects, the size of its community gives Ethereum the advantage of network effects.      Whether DeFi can shed its Wild West feel and mature sufficiently for mainstream adoption, the code and ideas generated by these engineers are laying the foundation for whatever regulated or unregulated blockchain-based finance models emerge in the future.      Complexity vs. simplicity There are legitimate concerns about security on Ethereum. With such a complex system, and so many different programs running on it, the attack surface is large. And given the challenges the community faces in migrating to Ethereum 2.0, including a new proof-of-stake consensus mechanism and a sharding solution for scaling transactions, it’s still not assured it will ever be ready for prime time.      Indeed, the relative lack of complexity is one reason why many feel more comfortable with Bitcoin Core’s security. Bitcoin is a one-trick pony, but it does that trick – keeping track of unspent transaction outputs, or UTXOs – very well and very securely. Its proven security is a key reason why bitcoin is crypto’s reserve asset.      Toward anti-fragility The inclusion of bitcoin in Ethereum smart contracts is inherently strengthening the DeFi system.      Decentralized exchanges (DEXs), which allow peer-to-peer crypto trading without centralized exchange (CEX) taking custody of your assets, have integrated WBTC into their markets to boost the liquidity needed to make them viable.      Meanwhile, the move by leading DeFi platform MakerDAO to include WBTC last spring in its accepted collateral has meant it has a bigger pool of value to generate loans against.      This expansion in DeFi’s user base and market offerings is in itself a boost to security. That’s not just because more developers means more code vulnerabilities are discovered and fixed. It’s because the combinations of investors’ short and long positions, and of insurance and derivative products, will ultimately get closer to Nassim Taleb’s ideal of an “antifragile” system.      That’s not to say there aren’t risks in DeFi. Many are worried that the frenzy around speculative activities such as “yield farming” and interconnected leverage could set off a systemic crisis.      If that happens, maybe Bitcoin can offer an alternative, more stable architecture for it. Either way, ideas to improve DeFi are coming all the time – whether for better system-wide data or for a more trustworthy legal framework.      Out of this hurly-burly, something transformative will emerge. Whether it’s dominated by Ethereum or spread across different blockchains, the end result will show more cross-protocol synergy than the chains’ warring communities would suggest.    At stake    Matt Luongo, founder of cryptocurrency venture production studio Thesis, wrote an op-ed discussing the similarities between “stacking sats” and decentralized finance. While hardnose bitcoiners may see DeFi as a distraction, Luongo thinks they should rethink their assertions.  The article, published Oct. 1, is excerpted below.    Staking sats?    Bitcoin’s usefulness and grounding as hard money set it apart from most of the crypto froth from the past several years. The ocean of Ethereum white papers produced has yielded comparatively few working projects, and even fewer that anyone outside the crypto world would call usable.      Regardless of Bitcoin’s advantages, I am on record saying that I am a monetary maximalist, not a Bitcoin maximalist. I believe finance is a human right, just like speech and assembly, and that we need a fair and transparent financial system that empowers individuals, not powerful middlemen. So while I believe in the soundness of Bitcoin and its ability to help reshape finance, I will support any project that furthers this ultimate vision for a new economic system.      The fact that Ethereum is not Bitcoin, that it has consistently driven hype and bubbles, and that it still has not found a workable long-term solution for scalability, does not mean it offers nothing of value. In fact, Ethereum’s top DeFi platforms are doing some truly exciting and innovative work, and they have the promise to further the cause of a decentralized future of money.      MakerDAO operates like a credit facility, driving liquidity and encouraging more lending when interest rates are low. Compound, with its developer-focused interest rate protocols, enables the savings and loan functions of traditional banks. In more arcane spheres, projects like Synthetix offer a version of derivatives trading. Together, these platforms represent the germ of a new financial system.      Projects with names like $YAM and $TENDIES do not inspire confidence, I know. But dig a little into what DeFi is and does, and the foundations that have been laid, and you’ll be pleasantly surprised. DeFi is very real, and it’s worth exploring and explaining.      Stacking sats is about steadily, gradually, doggedly accumulating wealth over time. And DeFi is in the same spirit when properly implemented (never a sure thing in the Ethereum community). It’s basic finance: DeFi lets people do things they already do through banks, mutual funds and other financial institutions. But done right, it offers these services in a way that’s fairer, more transparent and more rewarding. So it’s not an exaggeration to say that DeFi is an ally in achieving a vision it shares with Bitcoin: a trustless world of democratized, self-sovereign finance.      It would be myopic and self-defeating to ignore the potential of DeFi to advance a goal that is, after all, shared by all of us. It would be even more self-defeating to ignore real opportunities to put money to work, like when there’s a way for BTC holders to earn through cross-chain bridges like tBTC.      As Bitcoiners, we will always believe in the importance of sound money and in the Bitcoin blockchain as the best technology to facilitate it. There is plenty of risk in Ethereum and in DeFi. Potential investors must always do their due diligence. But I’m here to tell you that DeFi is for real. It’s a bubble, but it’s not just another bubble. And although there absolutely are “DeFi” platforms that will crash and burn, many of the concepts are sound. There are real opportunities for people to earn by putting their money to work – and where that’s true, investment and growth will follow.    Top shelf    Extortion claims Local government premises in Japan have been hit by a flood of extortion attempts demanding bitcoin. According to a report by Japan Today on Monday, such threats have been received in at least 18 prefectures since July. The extortionists reportedly demand a payment in bitcoin to avoid the detonation of an explosive device in various public buildings, from schools to hospitals, though none of the Japanese victims have paid the extortionists, per Japan Today. Austria has also suffered a spate of similar bomb threats.

This follows after news broke of a dual agency investigation into the firm for allegedly operating an unlicensed trading services.      Musk denies Elon Musk has thrown doubt on a claimed sighting of a bitcoin ATM at the Tesla Gigafactory in Nevada. Twitter user Will Reeves claimed on Sunday that he had ""just passed by and saw @elonmusk has a bitcoin ATM at the Gigafactory."" The tweet was accompanied by a Google maps image revealing the location of the ATM on the northern side of the factory complex. Tesla founder and CEO Elon Musk said he didn't believe the claim was ""accurate"" in a tweet on Monday. Bitcoin ATM firm LibertyX confirmed with CoinDesk it has installed three “traditional ATMs” on site “so employees can use their debit cards and buy bitcoin.""      Little impact The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority’s decision to ban individual investors from speculating on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is likely to have a minimal impact, partly because the market is so small, according to analysts and industry executives who track the trading business. Some U.K.-based brokerages that had offered the crypto derivative products to retail traders could see a drop-off in revenue, though big cryptocurrency exchanges including Kraken say the impact is likely to be minimal. While U.K. individuals can still trade the actual cryptocurrencies.      Digital yuan Chen Yulu, deputy governor of China's central bank, said in an article at the weekend that the digital yuan project should form an “independent” and ""high-quality"" element of the nation's financial infrastructure, South China Morning Post reports.

42432902,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO275h,1602520450,"Monero Leads Rally in Privacy Coins, Rising to Two-Year Highs","Major privacy-focused cryptocurrencies jumped on Monday, with monero (XMR), the biggest of the lot, extending its impressive recent run to two-year highs. The move came after a group of countries jointly called for ""back doors"" into encryption software. That backdoor access potentially diminishes the privacy-safeguarding utility of such software and is driving increased interest in the privacy coins.    Monero traded at $135 during early U.S. hours, the highest level since September 2018, according to CoinDesk 20.  The 15th largest cryptocurrency by market value has gained 23% this month alone and is up nearly 80% from lows below $75 observed in early September.  On a 24-hour basis, monero is currently up 7.6%, while bitcoin (BTC), the number one cryptocurrency, is up 0.75%.  Zcash (ZEC), also a privacy coin, is changing hands near $75 at press time, representing a 6.7% gain on the day.  Other cryptocurrencies with anonymity features such as zcoin, horizen and harmony are also flashing green, according to data source Messari.  These coins are gaining ground in the wake of a demand by the countries of the Five Eyes Alliance plus India and Japan for access to encrypted apps.  On Sunday, officials from the alliance – the U.S., U.K., Australia, Canada and New Zealand – signed, with India and Japan, a joint statement supporting strong encryption but with backdoor access that would help lawmakers protect vulnerable sections of society.  The statement escalates an ongoing battle between those favoring stronger encryption and companies building security protocols into their apps.  Lawmakers worldwide may eventually target privacy coins because they facilitate the hiding of user identity via encryption.

42432901,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO277h,1602520254,Securitize Is Taking Ethereum-Based Securities Into the DeFi Realm,"Connecting the worlds of security tokens and decentralized finance (DeFi) is the next logical step for Securitize, a kind of regulatory-compliant fixer when it comes to tracking and trading blockchain-based securities.    Announced Monday, Securitize is teaming up with a protocol called Tinlakehttps://centrifuge.io/products/tinlake/ from Centrifuge, which uses a clever system of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to enable real-world assets to participate in DeFi.    In an ideal world, any elements within the Ethereum ecosystem should be able to be built into one another, sharing new and useful features like automated market-making or other functions. This concept, a core tenet of DeFi, is known as “composability” (the analogy often used is the omni-building capacity of Lego bricks).      But there’s a catch: Digital securities, like their traditional counterparts, are regulated and have several control mechanisms that must be enforced. All securities, whether private or public require know-your-customer (KYC) identification of the person buying them, as well as mandatory investor qualification to determine which type of investor they are (retail or accredited, depending on the rules of their local jurisdictions).      That’s where Securitize comes in. Focused on smoothing the fragmented world of private securities trading, the firm has been honing its approach to identifying the owners of assets and the regulated peer-to-peer transfer of private security tokens. As such, the system is already 90% of the way to DeFi composability, said Securitize CEO Carlos Domingo.      “A lot of DeFi protocols are designed for unregulated utility tokens or cryptocurrencies, so they are not really suitable for security tokens,” Domingo said in an interview. “We have a thesis about how to make this work in a legal way, and so allow for things that exist in traditional capital markets, like market making, or lending and borrowing, all in an automated way.”      Read more: MakerDAO Weighs Accepting Real-World Assets as Crypto Loan Collateral      DeFi protocols often operate pseudonymous liquidity pools powered by automated smart contracts. The Securitize Tinlake integration, by contrast, will be strictly for wallets that are associated with Securitize ID, so that the person on either side of a trade is known, said Domingo.      Tinlake’s smart contracts pool together NFTs that represent real-world assets. For instance, one pool could be dedicated to invoices that might be used in a trade finance scenario, that are then used as collateral to finance loans in stablecoins like DAI or USDC.    DeFi dive    The current pools enabled by Tinlake are short-term loans that return the money to the investor within a short period of time, but the next step is exploring rolling pools that reinvest the dividends, and also receipt tokens that can be used by other investors to receive contributions from the pool (the latter is known in DeFi as liquidity provider, or LP, tokens).      Read more: SushiSwap Will Withdraw Up to $830M From Uniswap Today: Why It Matters for DeFi      But diving headlong into DeFi presents some interesting challenges, said Domingo. Keeping tabs on the ownership of securities contributed to a pool on some automated market-making protocol like Uniswap containing hundreds of securities, is very complex to implement, he added.      “It’s not impossible but it will take time to integrate with our protocol to control the transfer restrictions,” Domingo said.      Another key question relates to who can actually publicize the trades of private securities since in the U.K. you need an MTF (multilateral trading facility) license, or, in the U.S., an ATS (alternative trading system) license. “So while we might be 90% there with the technology, there is still a bit of regulatory uncertainty,” Domingo said.      Securitize is not considering adding governance tokens like Uniswap’s UNI, said Domingo, because it’s unclear whether those sorts of tokens are legal. But irrespective of that, he said there are still scenarios where it’s going to be more profitable to contribute securities against a liquidity pool rather than just waiting for them to appreciate over time.      “If you go and buy Apple shares on Robinhood, the only thing you can do is just to wait for them to appreciate over time. That’s it,” Domingo said. “But if these DeFi protocols become available over time for security tokens, as we think will happen, then suddenly there are other avenues for you to make money besides just holding on and waiting.”",POSITIVE,UNI,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MINING | TRADING | UNI,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/10/12/securitize-is-taking-ethereum-based-securities-into-the-defi-realm,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e688e8950502f411fc9818a9fa832e71a9622341-2000x1335.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The vote will be made official later this month.      The stockholders’ donation comes as international governments have looked increasingly askance at encryption-backed technologies such as privacy coins and wallets.      The ECC will continue operating under the same business structure, with Bootstrap acting as an umbrella firm of sorts. Bootstrap will be helmed, at least initially, by the ECC’s board of directors, zcash creator and ECC CEO Zooko Wilcox said in a Friday phone interview. The Zcash network is maintained by the ECC, independent developers and the Zcash Foundation.      A date for the ECC’s donation to Bootstrap has not been specified, but is aimed for around the network’s November hardfork, Canopy. The ECC has 24 investors, including Paradigm Capital co-founder Fred Ehrsam and venture capital firm Pantera Capital.    Zchanges    Practically speaking, the donation will free up cash flows for the ECC, which has continued to operate in the red regardless of a 160% year-to-date increase in the price of ZEC.      Under the Zcash founders’ agreement, the ECC receives 5% of miner revenue for developing the encryption tech backing the cryptocurrency. The ECC’s portion of future mining revenues will increase to 7% under Canopy, as agreed upon in February’s Zcash Improvement Proposal (ZIP) 1014.      Yet, at a higher level, the donation will allow the ECC to more fully embrace a central plank in ZIP 1014 – that of all future mining revenue furthering zcash’s potential as an asset, and not enriching founders or early investors. Those involved in the project’s 2016 launch garnered 15% of mining revenue under the old scheme.

Deal Ninja attorney Gabriel Shapiro told CoinDesk the ECC’s shift to non-profit status was “potentially preferable to the status quo muddle of having a non-U.S. ‘foundation’ and a U.S. ‘development company’ with unclear rules of engagement between them.”      Wilcox said the ECC transition to a non-profit was “in alignment” with the community’s stipulations.

BTC, the top cryptocurrency by market value, clocked a high of $11,524 at 13:45 UTC, the highest level since Sept. 2, and was trading at $11,480 at press time, gaining 0.95% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.  Meanwhile, ETH, at the same time, was traded around $383.42 at press time, up 2.17% in the past 24 hours. That’s the highest level since Sept. 20.  The rally came as digital currency asset manager Grayscale announced that its Ethereum Trust has become a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)-reporting company.  “This voluntary filing should not be confused as an effort to classify Grayscale Ethereum Trust as an exchange-traded fund (ETF),” Grayscale, which is owned by CoinDesk’s parent company Digital Currency Group, wrote in a press release on Monday.  “The news will likely spur on another wave of Ethereum outperforming bitcoin, especially given the growing total value locked (TVL) across the DeFi universe,” Denis Vinokourov, head of research at the London-based prime brokerage Bequant told CoinDesk.  Bitcoin has gained 59% this year while ether has rallied by nearly 200%.

42432908,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO27Lh,1602514062,MakerDAO’s Embrace of Centralized Stablecoins Offers Risks and Rewards,"MakerDAO, rebel no more?      There are two kinds of stablecoins. The centralized type is implemented on a blockchain but anchored to Wall Street and the Federal Reserve. Dai, a decentralized stablecoin governed by the Maker Decentralized Autonomous Organization (or MakerDAO) is emblematic of the second type. It stays as far away from The Man as possible.    J.P. Koning, a CoinDesk columnist, worked as an equity researcher at a Canadian brokerage firm and a financial writer at a large Canadian bank. He runs the popular Moneyness blog.    But over the last month or two, something strange has been happening. Like a vegan eating a steak, dai has been gobbling up huge amounts of centralized stablecoins as collateral. Has dai, once so edgy, donned a suit and gone Wall Street?      MakerDAO's ingestion of centralized stablecoins is part of its strategy for bringing dai back in line with its $1 target. It's a bold plan, but it could come at a price. MakerDAO could face pressure to import more of the traditional banking system's rules.    PayPal on blockchain    USD coin (USDC) and tether (USDT), the two largest centralized stablecoins, are deployed on public blockchains like Ethereum or Bitcoin’s Omni. These blockchains are maintained by an unruly cacophony of miners and nodes. The Centre Consortium that manages USDC and the Tether company exert control over the value of their tokens by yoking them to the dollar. They do this by keeping dollars in reserve at a regular bank and letting users convert between these traditional dollars and blockchain tokens at a 1:1 rate.      This connection to a bank means USDC and tether import many of the traditional banking system's rules. The companies managing the currencies are required to register with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). They must collect customer information. And they have built in the capacity to blacklist rogues should the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) require it. This cancels out much of the permissiveness provided by their underlying Ethereum or Omni hosts. Tether and USDC stablecoins may not be PayPal accounts, but are closer than you might think.      Not MakerDAO, though. MakerDAO has always been the least PayPal-like of the bunch.    The holy grail    I first learnt about MakerDAO back in 2015 when Rune Christensen, its founder, announced a product called eDollar (later to be rechristened dai). Much like the now defunct BitUSD stablecoin, MakerDAO was intent on achieving what I like to call the crypto holy grail: decentralization and stability.      To begin with, MakerDAO wanted to solve the roller coaster problem. Unlike bitcoin, dai tokens would be stabilized at $1. And so they would be usable as money. But dai wouldn't be just another tether. ""Unlike other stablecoins, dai is completely decentralized,"" its original white paper boasts, one that ""exists without the authority of a centralized entity.""      This meant that rather than storing reserve assets at a regulated bank, MakerDAO would hold decentralized ethereum reserves in a smart contract. Hived off from the banking system, the platform would inhabit a virtual land with few rules, no anti-money laundering proclamations and no token freezes.      MakerDAO has been incredibly successful. The amount of dai in circulation grew from nothing in 2017 to $900 million this week. The peg has held up, too. Unlike predecessor decentralized stablecoins like nubits and BitUSD, it never collapsed in value.      But there have been hiccups. Since March 2020, dai has stubbornly traded above $1. And nothing that MakerDAO did could bring its token back down to $1.    Reining in dai    The target misses can be blamed on a sudden shortage of dai. Decentralized finance and yield farming, which has been growing in leaps and bounds, had become voracious buyers of stablecoins.      Up till then, MakerDAO's go-to technique for closing a premium had always been to temper the demand for dai. MakerDAO would do so by reducing the reward, or interest rate, that dai holders enjoy. By April 2020, however, the interest rate that dai token holders receive had already been reduced from 8% to 0%. And MakerDAO code does not allow for a negative interest rate.      Negative interest rates have become a go-to tool for many central banks. But the topic is controversial in the MakerDAO community. Christensen, for example, has described negative rates as ""immediate death,"" a tool that if used would mean “irreversibly destroying virtually all of the organic adoption that has been achieved so far.""      Christensen’s worries seem excessive, but they aren’t entirely baseless. In the real world, the transition to negative interest rates means all commercial banks that keep deposits at their central bank face higher costs. Banks, in turn, pass these costs on to bank depositors. But banks have been hesitant to impose negative rates on their smaller retail customers for fear of angering them.      In any case, lacking a tool for modulating the huge demand for dai, MakerDAO was powerless to prevent dai from trading between $1.01 and $1.06 through most of summer.    Ingesting centralized stablecoins    By late August, MakerDAO policymakers had had enough. If excess demand was the problem, why not meet this by encouraging the creation of huge amounts of dai? And so in a series of moves, Maker made it much easier for users to submit centralized stablecoin collateral to create new dai.      Until then, anyone who deposited USDC collateral and got dai in return had to put in a hefty $110 worth of USDC for each $100 in dai. Under the new rules, users need only submit $101 USDC for each $100 in dai. By loosening its collateral requirements (it did the same for Paxos standard and TrueUSD stablecoins), MakerDAO encouraged a massive influx of centralized stablecoin collateral into the system and an efflux of new dai.      It worked. The shortage had ended. The supply of dai almost doubled from around $500 million to more than $900 million in two weeks. Whereas dai had traded at $1.06 in early September, it now fluctuates between $1.00 and $1.02.      But MakerDAO's coffers are now filled up with stablecoins. It's a strange look for the platform. When it debuted back in 2017, MakerDAO only allowed Ethereum to serve as the anchoring reserve asset for dai. It wasn't until late 2019 that other collateral assets could be used to fabricate dai, beginning with basic attention token, the native token for the Brave browser. But even as Maker widened its list of backing assets, Ethereum continued to dominate. At the beginning of September, Ethereum accounted for almost 80% of all dai created.      Ethereum now accounts for just 40% of all dai created. And 51% of dai in circulation has now been fabricated out of centralized stablecoins USDC, Paxos Standard, and TrueUSD. USDC alone accounts for $373 million, up from just $10 million a month ago.    The price of stability    Increased reliance on centralized stablecoins to stabilize the peg requires a major trade-off. It could translate into pressure for MakerDAO to conform to centralized finance's rule book.      If MakerDAO ingests even more of FinCEN-registered USDC's stablecoins, will nervous USDC execs start pushing MakerDAO to register with FinCEN?      Or maybe regulators will use centralized stablecoins as a Trojan horse for exerting control over MakerDAO. For instance, they could tell MakerDAO to apply for a banking charter on pain of the USDC consortium being ordered to drop MakerDAO as a customer, or to conform to consumer lending laws.      See also: ‘No Other Option but More Collateral’: The Short- (and Long-) Term Fixes for Dai’s Broken Peg      In a different scenario, ingested stablecoins might provide litigious investors with traction for launching lawsuits against MakerDAO. Or say that some USDC stablecoins are stolen and deposited in MakerDAO smart contracts. The FBI might order USDC to blacklist MakerDAO's holdings. This could render MakerDAO's stash of USDC collateral temporarily useless, thus hurting the peg.      None of these risks come out of the blue. The MakerDAO community anticipated blacklisting risk in early discussions about onboarding USDC. But protecting the peg is important, too. A stablecoin isn’t very useful if its price isn’t stable.    Taking the next step    What made the original version of dai so transgressive was its ability to recreate the dollar out of entirely censorship-resistant material. The new version of dai no longer relies solely on censorship-resistant material. But perhaps this new version is even more transgressive. It has secretly docked itself to the Federal Reserve by using USDC stablecoins as a bridging mechanism.      The problems posed by the ingestion of centralized stablecoins are a prelude to the larger challenges MakerDAO will face as it incorporates “real world assets,” or RWAs, as dai collateral. These are assets that reside in the real world, like real estate or Spotify royalty payments, but have been tokenized on the Ethereum blockchain. Since these assets will be embedded in real-world legal systems, they will only draw MakerDAO further out of the rule-free vacuum it has spent its formative years inhabiting.      Christensen is bullish on RWAs, describing their introduction as the first steps to “the greatest portfolio of assets that’s ever been built.” By increasing the range of collateral out of which dai can be fabricated, Christensen believes this will help solve future peg deviations:      “They set the stability fee to 0% on everything and it didn’t fix the peg, so I think that shows that there’s no other option but to onboard more collateral. Possibly the stablecoin solution works, but it’s not exactly a long-term solution, it’s a medium-term solution.”      But some MakerDAO purists dislike this shift towards the centralized end of the spectrum. An alternative vision is for MakerDAO to retreat back into its decentralized safe space.      For instance, if the system could be modified to allow for negative rates, then the next time dai wanders up to $1.05, MakerDAO wouldn’t need to slurp up centralized stablecoins. An interest rate of -4% or -5% would do the trick. Fabrication of dai could be entirely limited to collateral with few connections to the real-world legal system, like Ethereum. And so MakerDAO would be once again immune to external attacks.      On the other hand, perhaps getting more engaged with the real world, first via stablecoins and next through real world assets, is what MakerDAO needs if it is to change the world for the better. A bit more centralization may be the price of real change.",NEUTRAL,USDC,ETH | FIAT | MKR | TRADING | USDC,JP Koning,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/10/12/makerdaos-embrace-of-centralized-stablecoins-offers-risks-and-rewards,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ab7c2ec77eb3041bda32a54bb15c76d68958273a-1920x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Aave, one of the largest DeFi projects and provider of decentralized lending and borrowing, announced Monday that it has raised $25 million from investors Blockchain Capital, Standard Crypto and Blockchain.com Ventures.  The project's CEO, Stani Kulechov, said the investment would go toward growing Aave's team to better serve growing Asian markets and bringing DeFi ""closer"" to institutional investors.  The investors in the strategic raise will take part in the protocol's staking and governance, per a press release.  According to data provider DeFi Pulse, Aave is currently the third-largest DeFi protocol, with $1.15 billion in cryptocurrency locked in.  Having seen explosive growth over the summer, the total value locked in all DeFi projects has plateaued somewhat in recent weeks and now stands at $10.79 billion.  Per price data site CoinMarketCap, Aave's LEND token is up 2.38% in 24 hours at time of writing.  However, the protocol is in the process of migrating these over to a new AAVE token, as reported previously.  The process will ultimately see ownership of the protocol shift over to a “genesis governance” built and approved by token holders.

Accredited investors who hold the trust will be able to sell after only a six-month lockup instead of the usual 12.  ""We're seeing interest from investors who have become more comfortable with digital currencies through bitcoin exposure, and are now looking at how else they can diversify within the asset class,"" said Grayscale's managing director, Michael Sonnenshein.

Chen Yulu, deputy governor of the central bank, said in an article over the weekend that the digital yuan project should form an “independent” and ""high-quality"" element of the nation's financial infrastructure, South China Morning Post reports.  In comments published by the central bank's own China Finance magazine, Chen added research and development for the digital yuan should proceed at faster pace, while pilots should show the CBDC is ""controllable and safeguards the security of payments.""  China recently announced a new focus on an economic strategy dubbed ""dual circulation,"" which would rely more on internal demand to buffer against international tensions, especially with the U.S.  “We must serve dual circulation with fintech-led innovations,” Chen said about the digital yuan.  The CBDC project is already thought to be closing in on a full launch, having been in testing in major cities with banks and commercial enterprises.  Last week the city of Shenzhen, together with the central bank, launched a kind of lottery allowing local residents to apply for some of 10 million digital yuan that will be handed out.  A report at the time suggested thousands of retailers are already set up to accept the digital currency.

The column, which is widely read on Wall Street and beyond, noted a survey by the Bank for International Settlements earlier this year that found one-fifth of central banks will likely issue some form of digital currency in the next six years. This rush might lead to some serious problems, the WSJ column said.  Substantial risks to bank funding and financial stability should be weighed against trying to solve problems such as declining cash payments with a totally new, untested system instead of just trying to fix the existing structure.  Why, the column asks, create digital currencies to address the shift to digital payments when mobile apps and cards are already filling that need?  Digital currencies, with their security and anonymity, would make putting money in banks via deposits less attractive. This would reduce banks' most stable source of funding, leaving them much more vulnerable, the WSJ column said.  The only real benefit for digital currencies is security and privacy, and even that is against the interests of countries as it undermines their attempts to fight money laundering, according to the publication.

42405162,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeLU2w,1602506289,First Mover: Bitcoin's Best Week Since July Shows Limited Toll of UK Retail Crypto Futures Ban,"Not everyone is happy with the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority’s decision to ban individual investors from speculating on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and there's an argument to be made that the agency's rationale was hollow.      But the ban is likely to have a minimal impact, partly because the market is so small, CoinDesk's Muyao Shen reported Monday, citing analysts and industry executives who track the trading business.      Some U.K.-based brokerages that had offered the crypto derivative products to retail traders could see a drop-off in revenue, though big cryptocurrency exchanges including Kraken say the impact is likely to be minimal. While U.K. individuals can still trade the actual cryptocurrencies, there may be some traders who will seek to skirt the rules by trading on offshore exchanges.      The ban is set to take effect in January. Professional investors weren’t barred from trading cryptocurrency derivatives partly because they “have greater understanding of the risks and greater capacity to absorb potential investment losses,” according to an FCA report this month.      “Those still keen on trading crypto derivatives will just find ways to open accounts in unaffected regions,” Don Guo, CEO of Broctagon Fintech Group, told CoinDesk in an email. “There is a stark risk that retail traders will simply trade on unregulated exchanges, which in fact puts them at more risk.”      Among those affected, the proposal does appear to be quite unpopular: The FCA report indicated that some 97% of comments submitted in connection with the rulemaking were opposed to agency’s proposed ban.      CoinDesk Research Director Noelle Acheson argued in her weekly Crypto Long & Short newsletter that the agency overstepped, since its ""job includes protecting investors, not passing judgment on new asset groups."" One of the agency's reasons for the ban was the ""extreme volatility"" in cryptocurrency prices, but bitcoin is far less volatile than many stocks, including Tesla.      Read More: UK Crypto Derivatives Ban Seen Having Limited Effect on Small Market    Bitcoin Watch    Bitcoin is struggling to extend the preceding week's 6.6% gain, the biggest percentage rise since the last week of July.      The cryptocurrency is currently trading in the red near $11,250, having printed highs near $11,500 over the weekend.      The decline could be short-lived, as the global equity markets are trading in the green despite the resurgence of the coronavirus concerns across Europe.      Besides, the bitcoin market looks strong – the cryptocurrency rallied last week even though miners ran down inventory by 1,000 BTC by selling more than they mined, according to the MRI figure provided by data source Bytetree.com.      The miner’s rolling inventory (MRI) figure, which tracks the changes in miners' inventory levels, held well above 100% last week, as those responsible for generating coins boosted supply. The five- and 12-week MRIs are also holding above 100%.      In other words, the buying pressure has been strong enough to absorb extra supplies from those responsible for generating the cryptocurrencies. That's a bullish sign.      Also, the payment company Square's recent disclosure of their bitcoin investments has given market players a fresh shot of confidence, and technical bias has turned bullish with the cryptocurrency's weekly close above $11,200.      As per charts, resistances are located at $11,500 and $12,000. On the downside, support is seen at $11,000, which, if breached, could cause some short-term technical traders to exit the market.      - Omkar Godbole      Read More: Bitcoin down 1% after biggest weekly price gain since July    Token Watch    Bitcoin (BTC): Someone just moved $11M of bitcoin that was tucked away in idle wallets since being mined in 2010.

42405165,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeLU0y,1602505016,It’s Time to Launch the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain,"It’s time for the Ethereum 2.0 beacon chain to launch.      We've spent the last nine months testing the life out of this thing. The year began with huge, long-running single client testnets: Sapphire, Topaz and Onyx networks run by Prysmatic Labs. In April, there were small multi-client networks: Schlesi, Witti and Altona – all named after subway stations, in keeping with Ethereum testnet tradition.    Ben Edgington advises on Eth2 across ConsenSys. CoinDesk's ""Invest: Ethereum Economy"" event is Oct. 14.    And then the big one, the Medalla testnet. Named after Medalla Milagrosa on the Buenos Aires Underground, it has been running for over two months, with four different client implementations involved throughout that time. It continues to run today with over 50,000 validators actively participating, making it one of the largest decentralized consensus networks in existence.      Progress has not all been smooth. A few days after the start of the Medalla testnet, one of the clients suffered a critical issue that disrupted the chain for a few days. But this is what testnets are for. We kept the chain running and were able to bring it back to full health, with a slew of lessons learned.      Among them, client diversity is important. If we want the beacon chain to be resilient, no single client implementation can dominate. As Danny Ryan, a core researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, wrote, “The incident on Medalla was significantly amplified by the failure of the dominant Prysm client, and as we move toward mainnet, we, as a community, must consciously seek to remedy this.”      Four high-quality, audited and battle-tested clients are currently available to run at beacon chain launch: Teku, Lighthouse, Nimbus and Prysm. Each has its own flavor and target user base. For example, Teku, the Eth 2.0 client from ConsenSys, has been designed and built primarily with institutional and professional stakers in mind (although I shall be running it at home), with extra security tools such as a remote signing service and a slashing prevention service.    The beacon chain will have real rewards and real penalties, and we simply can’t simulate these with testnets.    Client teams also learned to agree on common standards for migrating information between their implementations. This allows stakers to safely switch quickly between clients and will greatly help with incident recovery in future.      See also: A Day in the Life of an Ethereum 2.0 Validator    Skin in the game    Perhaps the biggest lesson? It is hard to faithfully replicate proof-of-stake on networks that are not incentivized. Participation in these testnets is completely free, which is not at all realistic. On testnets, stakers can neglect their nodes with no real consequences; they can register thousands of validators then just switch them off and they can put down stakes but never join the network.      On the real beacon chain, with significant value genuinely at stake, we expect user behavior to be quite different.      This is why it is now time to go live with the beacon chain. We have tested everything else in every way we can: the deposit contract has been formally verified; the deposit tools have been audited; the specification has been audited; the beacon chain has been formally modeled; the node discovery protocol has been audited; the networking protocol has been audited; the crypto-economics have been simulated; we are running incentivized attack nets; we’ve been doing fuzz testing; every client has undergone at least one third-party security audit. Hundreds of pairs of eyes have scrutinized the whole process over the last year.      However, the real beacon chain will have real rewards and real penalties, and we simply can’t simulate these with testnets.      On the reward side, with the minimum necessary number of 16,384 individual 32 ETH stakes (one stake is one validator), gross yield for validating on the beacon chain is over 20% per year. Even in these days of heady – if temporary – DeFi (decentralized finance) returns, this is quite compelling.      Penalties are not especially onerous. As long as you are able to keep your validator online at least half the time, you will not lose your stake except in extreme circumstances. And as long as you follow reasonable guidelines, enough protection is in place that there is no chance of your stake being slashed.      We’ve tested these things as far as we can in the lab: Now it’s time to run it in the wild. The Ethereum 2.0 roadmap has been carefully divided into phases so that we can try out this new, ambitious proof-of-stake mechanism in isolation, in phase 0, before anything else depends on it.      Thus, in the absolute worst case of a catastrophic failure or attack that affects a large proportion of stakers, there’s always the opportunity to agree to roll back the chain without any knock-on consequences.      We’re planning one more launch rehearsal in mid-October, the Zinken testnet. Not many days after that I expect the deposit contract to be deployed, with a target beacon chain genesis within about six weeks.      See also: 3 Things You Should Know Before Staking on Ethereum 2.0    Commitments    Staking, from the start, will not be for everyone.      One reason for is it can be quite demanding technically. Stakers need to keep a server running as close to 24/7 as possible. They need to keep their systems secure and stay on top of client software updates. For those not confident about hosting a staking node themselves, there are plenty of third-party services becoming available. Within ConsenSys, we are offering Codefi Staking, a white-label, turnkey solution for businesses that want to stake on Ethereum 2.0.      Another thing to be aware of is that, once in, you are committed for the long haul. From the start, stakers will be able to stop validating and freeze their stake and rewards if they wish. However, that ether will remain stuck on the beacon chain until Phase 1.5 of the Eth 2.0 roadmap has been delivered.      Phase 1.5 is the point at which the current Ethereum chain gets on-boarded into the Ethereum 2.0 system, along with all its accounts and contracts. Only after that will stakers be able to claim their rewards and recover their stakes. Until then, there is no way to exit your funds. Work on Phase 1.5 is moving along nicely, but it does not have a fixed delivery timeline. It could be a couple of years away yet.      As for me, I’ve been involved in Ethereum 2.0 long enough, and followed it closely enough, that I believe I know where all the bodies are buried. I am confident enough in the integrity and security of what we have built, and the teams that have built it, that my household plans to be staking on the beacon chain from day one.

42405163,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeLU1x,1602502437,Bitcoin Down 1% After Biggest Weekly Price Gain Since July,"Bitcoin (BTC) has crossed into bullish territory with the biggest weekly gain in 2.5 months.    The top cryptocurrency by market value climbed nearly 6.6% in the seven days to Oct. 11, capping its biggest single-week percentage rise since the last week of July.  The flipping of the stiff resistance of $11,200 (Sept. 18) into support is bullish, according to Stack Funds research analyst Lennard Neo.  So far, however, the follow-through to the breakout has been poor: The cryptocurrency is currently trading in the red near $11,250, having printed highs near $11,500 over the weekend.  However, the pullback may be short-lived, miner outflows suggest.  Last week, bitcoin miners sold more than they generated and ran down inventory by around 1,000 BTC, according to data source Bytetree.com.  The miners' rolling inventory (MRI) figure, which tracks the changes in how much bitcoin miners are holding, held well above 100% last week; the five- and 12-week MRIs are also above 100%.  Miners liquidate their holdings almost on a daily basis to cover operational costs but will offer more when they feel the market has the strength to absorb the additional coins without harming price.  As such, the increased miner outflow is sign of strength in the market, according to Charlie Morris, chief investment officer at ByteTree Asset Management.  Additionally, payment company Square's recent disclosure of major bitcoin investments has given market players a fresh shot of confidence, Philip Gradwell, chief economist at the blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis, told CoinDesk.  The major portion of the last week's 6.6% rise happened after Square announced its bitcoin investment on Thursday.  While the path of least resistance for bitcoin appears to be on the higher side, a move to the next major resistance at $12,000 may remain elusive if the resurgence of the coronavirus cases across Europe, tanks global equities and boosts haven demand for the U.S. dollar.  ""The macro-environment factors still play a strong factor in the direction of BTC as its correlation to the SPX [S&P 500] continues,"" data analytics firm Santiment noted.

According to a report by Japan Today on Monday, such threats have been received in at least 18 prefectures since July.  The extortionists demand a payment in bitcoin to avoid the detonation of an explosive device, per the report.  Austria has also suffered a spate of similar bomb threats, as CoinDesk reported back in August.  Japan Post said city halls or schools have been the subject of the threats, receiving an email demanding varying amounts of bitcoin.  In one case, in Yamagata City, the demand was for 40 bitcoin, worth over $454,000 at time of writing.  The cases in Austria were demanding about $20,000 in bitcoin; prices were at slightly higher levels around $11,700 per bitcoin at the time.  None of the Japanese victims have paid the extortionists, per Japan Today.  Rather than choose major metropolitan centers, the attackers seem to be targeting local governments in rural areas, such as Sanjo, Niigata Prefecture; Tara, Saga Prefecture; and Minami, Tokushima Prefecture, among others.

In a blog post Monday, the exchange's operator 100x announced Malcolm Wright will come aboard as the first chief compliance officer for the group.  Wright comes with 30 years of experience in compliance and anti-money laundering, per the post.  He currently chairs the Advisory Council and AML Working Group at Global Digital Finance, as well as being a speaker on topics including the Financial Action Tasks Force's international guidance for regulators around virtual asset service providers.  According to his LinkedIn profile, Wright is also an associate fellow of the Centre for Financial Crime and Security Studies at the U.K.'s Royal United Services Institute, a body working to address financial crimes.  100x said the new hire will lead the group's compliance efforts internationally and will report to the new interim CEO and COO Vivien Khoo.  Khoo replaced former CEO Arthur Hayes last week amid the fallout from the legal issues that hit the company on Oct. 1.  BitMEX, other associated entities including 100x and its founders were charged by both the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and federal prosecutors in New York over allegations the exchange had illegally offered derivatives trading to customers in the U.S. and violated the Bank Secrecy Act.  BitMEX's operator has since said it will carry out business as usual but saw fit to shake up the executive team, removing Hayes and other founders Samuel Reed and Ben Delo from executive roles.  The hiring of the compliance chief would seem to be the latest reaction to the charges, and an effort to avoid similar situations in future.  [Updated after clarification from 100x] 100x told CoinDesk prior to Wright joining as chief compliance officer, Khoo had been responsible for building the ""regulatory affairs"" function.

The ATM was first claimed to have been sighted by Twitter user Will Reeves, who posted on Sunday he had ""just passed by and saw @elonmusk has a bitcoin ATM at the Gigafactory.""  The tweet was accompanied by a Google maps image revealing the location of the ATM on the northern side of the massive factory complex.  According to a Sunday report by Finbold, the ATM was installed by LibertyX in August of this year solely for the use by employees of the factory.  However, Tesla founder and CEO Elon Musk said he didn't believe the claim was ""accurate"" in a tweet on Monday. The post to which Musk replied has since been deleted, presumably in response to his tweet.  CoinDesk reached out to Tesla for confirmation but had not received a reply by press time.  However, Reeves' sighting was apparently confirmed to CoinDesk by bitcoin ATM operator LibertyX in a direct message, which said: ""We have enabled [three] traditional ATMs inside so employees can use their debit cards and buy bitcoin.""  LibertyX now claims to have over 5,000 crypto ATMs in operation across the U.S., as well as a bitcoin buying service in around 20,000 stores.

42405149,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeLTs7,1602489600,Revamped Crypto Derivatives Exchange Qume Set to Fly in Wake of BitMEX Woes,"The timing couldn’t be better for regulation-focused trading platform Qumehttps://qume.io/, which unveils a revamped set of services Monday. Even in its soft-launch phase, the derivatives exchange has been mopping up customers in the wake of U.S. charges against BitMEX.    “We’ve seen an uptick in users, with about 2,000 customer sign-ups in the last week,” Aditya Mishra, CEO of the Singapore-based Qume, said in an interview. “In terms of specific trading volume I guess we will really know in the next week or so.”      Nearly 30% of BitMEX’s bitcoin balance has been withdrawn by customers since U.S. regulators cracked down on the firm on Oct. 1, according to Coin Metrics, with big players like Binance, Gemini and Kraken being the immediate beneficiaries.      Having noticed the crypto derivatives space operated “like the Wild West,” Mishra said the clampdown by U.S. regulators and federal prosecutors did not come as a huge surprise within the derivatives community.      The goal for Qume, from back in January 2019 when it began being built, was to be regulation-first, Mishra said.      “Our focus was to build out a high-performance crypto derivatives exchange, and have it sit under some sort of regulatory framework,” he said. “In the last year and a half or so, the market has obviously evolved, and there are several other derivatives participants [that] have emerged. Some of them are doing pretty well for themselves but most operate in a fairly unregulated fashion.”      Read more: UK Crypto Derivatives Ban Seen Having Limited Effect on Small Market      Qume, which is incorporated in Singapore, grew out of the sandbox of the Central Bank of Bahrain. In terms of know-your-customer (KYC) and anti–money laundering (AML) compliance, a team including former employees of JPMorgan and Nomura drafted up a regulatory framework. In addition, Qume last week completed the integration of Berlin-based Fractal, which uses AI and runs photos of new users across KYC databases in their home jurisdictions.      The derivatives platform does not offer its services to customers based in the U.S. or retail customers in the U.K.      Just last week the Financial Conduct Authority finalized its ban on crypto derivatives to retail customers based in Britain.    DEX hybrid    Thanks to the explosive growth of decentralized finance (DeFi), firms like Qume are busy figuring out how to build bridges to a more decentralized trading experience, focusing on areas like custody.      The platform, which previously raised $3.5 million with a cap table that includes DeFi darlings like Robert Leshner and Calvin Liu of Compound Finance, provides customers with a kind of hybrid offering that can operate like a decentralized exchange (DEX).      To this end, Qume teamed up with Hashflow, a protocol that helps platforms combine centralized order-matching and trade execution with decentralized custody and post-trade settlement.      To decentralize the entire trading experience is doable but kind of clunky, said Mishra, who claims to have struck a balance. He said Qume’s centralized aspect has sub-millisecond latency and institutional-grade throughput of between 100,000 and 200,000 transactions per second. On the other hand, the DEX component is there thanks to Hashflow’s second-layer protocol.      “So we can have two different sorts of customers,” said Mishra. “There is a certain type of user that really cares about decentralization and will only come and trade if they control their own keys. But then there is also the more traditional customer from India, for example, who just sees the volatility in the crypto markets, but doesn’t necessarily want any exposure to crypto as such.”      Read more: Crypto Long & Short: A UK Ban on Crypto Derivatives Will Hurt, Not Protect Investors      Rather than focusing on the typical Asia markets, Qume is directing its attention towards fresh pastures in India, the Middle East and Africa, said Mishra. The company is poised to make inroads to the Indian crypto market, driven by the acquisition of Indian spot exchange BitPolo back in August of this year.      “India is still a gray area for now but my personal opinion is there should be a regulatory framework for crypto, especially given the size of the developer talent pool in the jurisdiction,” said Mishra. “Just look at the strides being made in China. I think it would be a travesty if India is kept out of this technology revolution.”",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/10/12/revamped-crypto-derivatives-exchange-qume-set-to-fly-in-wake-of-bitmex-woes,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/156dae72e72deef082c970f65f10cf16032b8bb7-2000x1333.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405145,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeLTq9,1602475200,UK Crypto Derivatives Ban Seen Having Limited Effect on Small Market,"The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority's decision to ban individual investors from speculating on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is likely to have a minimal impact, partly because the market is so small, according to analysts and industry executives who track the trading business.      Some U.K.-based brokerages that had offered the crypto derivative products to retail traders could see a drop-off in revenue, though big cryptocurrency exchanges including Kraken say the impact is likely to be minimal. While U.K. individuals can still trade the actual cryptocurrencies, there may be some traders who will seek to skirt the rules by trading on offshore exchanges.      The ban is set to take effect in January. Professional investors weren't barred from trading cryptocurrency derivatives partly because they ""have greater understanding of the risks and greater capacity to absorb potential investment losses,"" according to an FCA report this month.      “Those still keen on trading crypto derivatives will just find ways to open accounts in unaffected regions,” Don Guo, CEO of Broctagon Fintech Group, told CoinDesk in an email. “There is a stark risk that retail traders will simply trade on unregulated exchanges, which in fact puts them at more risk.”      Few U.K.-based retail investors trade crypto derivative products directly, according to Sui Chung, CEO of CF Benchmarks, which provides price indexes to exchanges including Chicago-based CME Group.      Instead, they normally go through so-called contract for difference (CFD) providers, Chung said.      Regulated brokers and exchanges that had offered crypto derivatives and exchange-traded notes (ETNs) to retail traders included the Kraken-owned Crypto Facilities, CMC Markets and IG Index.      “This has a very minimal impact on Crypto Facilities,” a Crypto Facilities spokesperson told CoinDesk in an email.      “We anticipate no material impact resulting from the FCA announcement as these products form a very small part of our diversified and global business,” IG Group told CoinDesk in a statement. ”The impacted revenue following the FCA restrictions would be less than 1% of IG Group’s overall revenue.”      As recently as May, crypto made up 2.7% of IG Group’s total revenue this year, of which the U.K. market was only 1% to 1.5%, according to a research note by Vivek Raja and Paul McGinnis, analysts from Shore Capital, on Oct 6. According to the note, crypto was within 18% of CMC Markets’ total revenue as of March.      Both CME Group and CMC Markets declined CoinDesk’s request to comment on this topic.      A research report released by the FCA on June 30 estimated that about 3.86% of the general population hold cryptocurrencies in the U.K., with 12% of respondents saying they “never” monitor the prices of their cryptocurrencies.      “Consumers seem to treat cryptocurrencies as a form of speculation akin to gambling, rather than as a payment or investment,” according to the report.      A separate FCA report this month indicated that some 97% of comments submitted in connection with the rulemaking were opposed to agency's proposed ban.      “With most of the bigger firms, whether that’s Coinbase or Gemini, I think the majority of them aren’t affected by it,” Yang Li, the chief growth officer at Ziglu, a U.K.-based cryptocurrency platform, said in an interview with CoinDesk. “It was a niche product.”      A silver lining for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies might be that with more robust regulations on nascent digital-asset markets might encourage more institutional investors to jump in.      “Any step toward a better-defined regulatory framework serves to legitimize crypto as a mainstream investment for those institutions,” said Dmitry Tokarev, CEO of London-based crypto custodian Copper, told CoinDesk via email.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/10/12/uk-crypto-derivatives-ban-seen-having-limited-effect-on-small-market,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b6db8cd206ec3786ffaf00fd353af905e9c39f27-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
