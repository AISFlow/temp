42425219,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvU9h,1387834850,Seedcoin: Incubator Brings Bitcoin Startups to the World,"Bitcoin presents an entirely new kind of economy to the world: decentralized, borderless and mostly unregulated. It's also enabling a new generation of entrepreneurs from outside the world's traditional, or 'developed' business breeding grounds. Helping them find their place is the world's first seed-stage startup fund exclusively for bitcoin businesses, Seedcoin.  Heading Seedcoin is co-founder Eddy Travia, a Hong Kong-based French expat who also organized Asia's first bitcoin conference in Singapore in mid-November. Despite having its offices in Hong Kong, Seedcoin's focus is international and (at this stage) not only on Asia, providing initial startup support to those with great ideas but in need of capital, guidance and connections.  The company launched its Seedcoin Fund I (SFI) on bitcoin securities platform Havelock Investments this week, with seven new businesses from several different countries and economies. SFI includes Singapore-based derivatives exchange BTC.sx, payment processors GoCoin, Cryptopay.me and Monero.co, Mexican remittance-focused exchange MEXBT, easy-to-use wallet client Hive, and a new kind of SIM card-based wallet called zSIM.  Funds raised through Havelock will be distributed among the startups, with Seedcoin keeping a portion as a management fee. Investors in SFI will receive dividends in bitcoin indirectly from the startups.  Searching the world  Seedcoin's first active business was DealCoin, a face-to-face bitcoin exchange and escrow platform who 'went public' on Havelock Investments in September, raising over 500 BTC in the first 10 minutes. Dealcoin's founder, Hakim Mamoni, first introduced Travia to bitcoin and is also Seedcoin's CTO and co-founder.  Travia said Seedcoin had received ""60 applications through various channels,"" and had plans to help around 15 startups including bitcoin wallets, exchanges, and a few payment processors.  ""With bitcoin, we're still in the 'infrastructure phase'. After that will come the merchants, and everything else that helps people pay in, and use, bitcoin.""  Seedcoin's goal is to help entrepreneurs all over the world, both in 'developed' economies and some with less experience in international business.  ""There are things we take for granted in the Western world,"" said Travia, like a developed banking system. ""We have a certain know-how about business processes, banking, etc. But take regions like Eastern Europe for example. There are young, brilliant guys, extremely talented and at ease with programming, but don't know anything about raising funds.""  Travia said youth and inexperience meant a lot of bitcoin entrepreneurs were pretty casual in their approach, but were capable of learning fast and developing the professionalism they needed to grow.  [post-quote]  ""One guy asked me if he even needed to bother incorporating a business! He works entirely with bitcoin and didn't even have a bank account.""  Travia said his company is building a network of mentors all around the world in places like Kenya, Philippines, Argentina, Ecuador, South Africa and Brazil. Even though Seedcoin is a 'virtual incubator', face to face relationships remain an essential ingredient in this kind of business.  With China wobbling as a bitcoin haven and a difficult 48-state regulatory environment for 'money transmitters' in the US, the world is likely to see more bitcoin innovation from other places, which have plenty of entrepreneurs but are not traditionally associated with startup activity.  ""We don't have any plans to invest in the US at the moment, but the people we know there are asking us to provide them with opportunities in Asia and elsewhere,"" Travia said.  Hong Kong and Singapore  Hong Kong is a desirable place for any business to operate, said Travia, not just bitcoin-related ones. Despite the fact he hasn't seen much bitcoin activity in Hong Kong yet, he believes it could easily grow into a hub for trading platforms. The territory's legal system is business-friendly and autonomous from China's, and there haven't been any overt moves to regulate bitcoin there so far.  Singapore also shows promise, as another city-state with financial hub status and a healthy technology startup scene. Its financial regulator, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has issued warnings on bitcoin but also recently approved the trading platform itBit, which itself raised $5m in startup capital.  ""The Singapore conference in November was a lot bigger than we expected,"" Travia said. ""It's all going very fast, as you can imagine.""  Travia says he, like many people, only became involved with the bitcoin startup scene in mid-2013. He began traveling to Asia in 1999 to recruit students for a technology-focused MBA, and then moved to China permanently in 2004 to engage in private equity investments.  After arranging several VC deals for Chinese startups and attending VC conferences, he noticed Chinese companies starting to look internationally for investors. He decided to become a bridge between them and foreigners looking for new opportunities.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/12/23/seedcoin-incubator-brings-bitcoin-startups-to-the-world,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4cca7cf8793c901c04021e88418297d286d9cd79-797x477.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425227,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvULh,1387813546,Bitcoin Analysts Contribute to a Post-Legal Tender Era,"The year 2013 saw at least three bitcoin analyst reports from financial investment firms, an astonishing achievement for a young five-year-old digital currency. In some economic circles, bitcoin has slowly entered the 'reserve currency' lexicon.  Are we entering a post-legal tender era, where the provision of money is determined by the market and not by central bankers? Why do we see mainstream analysts reporting on price and economic impact for bitcoin when we never really saw that with other digital currencies?  The reason is simple – previous digital currencies were not decentralized with an independent floating exchange rate and they did not operate beyond confiscation.  Examples such as Digicash and e-Gold were brilliant proofs of concept, but their centralized nature also offered a single point of failure. Governments are not going to accept a challenge to their monetary authority if they don't have to.  In a paper entitled ""Regulating Digital Currencies: Bringing Bitcoin Within the Reach of the IMF,"" Nicholas A. Plassaras suggests that the International Monetary Fund is ill-equipped to handle the widespread use of bitcoins into the foreign exchange market, highlighting the inability of the Fund to intervene in the event of a speculative attack on a country's currency by bitcoin users.  He also hints at some of the tools that the IMF may consider deploying in the face of the global bitcoin challenge.  That academic study was followed by three analyst reports from the institutional investment industry. Together, all four studies solidify bitcoin's maturity into a new and unique asset class with broad implications for both fiscal and monetary policy.  On 31st July, BBVA Research released ""Bitcoin: A Chapter in Digital Currency Evolution"" which concludes that bitcoin is here to stay and that the regulators and financial institutions embracing bitcoin early will likely become the leaders of the future digital monetary system.  On 1st December, Wedbush Securities released ""Bitcoin: Intrinsic Value as Conduit for Disruptive Payment Network Technology"" by Gil Luria and Aaron Turner.  The report observes three key sources of demand for bitcoin:    (a) as a disruptive payment network technology,      (b) an alternative uncorrelated asset class, and    (c) a safe haven currency.    Additionally, the report states that bitcoin represents another potential low-cost funding method for PayPal, leading Wedbush to predict ""that with more regulatory clarity PayPal would likely embrace bitcoin.""  On 5th December, BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research published ""Bitcoin: A First Assessment"" by David Woo, head of global FX and rates strategy. Since Woo is considered to be one of the leading currency minds on Wall Street, his 14-page report represents a massive endorsement for bitcoin.  Woo states:  ""We believe bitcoin can become a major means of payment for e-commerce and may emerge as a serious competitor to traditional money transfer providers. As a medium of exchange, bitcoin has clear potential for growth, in our view.""  Placing a $1,300 price target on bitcoin, he also identifies the three things that need to happen in order to justify the current bitcoin valuation – it will need to account for at least 10% of all global e-commerce B2C transactions, become one of the top three players in the money transfer industry, and acquire a store of value reputation close to silver.  As a contra indicator, the Bank of America Woo report can probably claim responsibility for diffusing the most recent bitcoin rally that took the cryptocurrency to an intraday high of $1,156.00 on the CoinDesk BPI.  As we gradually enter a post-legal tender era, it behooves us to examine the possible implications for fiscal and monetary policy within a bitcoin economic environment. This article focuses on fiscal policy while a future piece will focus on monetary policy.  Aside from the beneficial wave of new job creation and economic opportunity, bitcoin as a competitive and successful monetary unit influences some pretty substantial adjustments forthcoming to fiscal policy.  High on the list, of course, is the effect on true income determination and the resulting taxation policy. A growing army of bitcoin independent contractors and informal merchants selling labor and goods will operate off-the-grid, adhering to the same honor system that exists for paper cash today.  To fill State coffers, it is likely that the bulk of tax revenue from individuals will shift from taxing income to taxing consumption (or spending).  Good riddance. A progressive income tax is one of the fundamental tenets of Marxism and it holds back incentives for innovation and achievement.  Far more likely in a bitcoin environment would be heavy taxes on consumption, which are regressive in nature but also more equitable than progressive taxes. The ease of bitcoin merchant identification and point-of-sale audits makes consumption taxes nearly inevitable for a worried nation-state with diminishing revenue.  Other fiscal policy impacts revolve around how the spending beast will be starved by a lack of sufficient revenue to pursue global military adventurism and other unpopular spending programs made possible only by the ability to print prosperity.  The arrogance of control maintained through the unlimited issuance model of the world's reserve currency will be dealt a mighty blow.  For the first time in modern history, a government will actually be forced to justify why they want to increase direct taxation and to demonstrate why that particular activity should be funded. Consequently, everyday people will become more empowered in the government actions executed under their name.  However, many in society will be left behind by this monumental shift of real wealth leaking out of national fiat currencies, because people have largely underestimated the widespread, latent demand for a non-political currency.  Joerg Platzer  , founder of Crypto Economics Consulting Group, encourages individuals to start preparing for this day in advance to ensure economic survival. He also emphasizes the need for governments to be honest and to anticipate the vast swath of society that will simply be impoverished after the great wealth transfer to a cryptocurrency society.  Further economic thoughts on the cryptocurrency and free banking space will undoubtedly be filled out by other bitcoin economic thinkers, such as Peter Šurda, Konrad Graf, JP Koning, and George Selgin.

42425224,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvUJh,1387809914,PawnCoin Co-Founder John Light Talks Bitcoin Volatility and Buttonwood,"John Light is the co-founder of PawnCoin, an innovative way for bitcoin users to unlock the value of their bitcoins. He has been making the rounds with investors, pitching his business in front of an audience at the recent Plug and Play EXPO where 10 other bitcoin-related startups also were seeking funds.  Light spoke to us about his startup, how it will operate with the risks of volatility and why Buttonwood has become less of an open air cryptocurrency market and more of a social gathering.  CoinDesk: Tell us about PawnCoin.  John Light: We are going to be offering customers a cash advance based on the value of their bitcoins. So if bitcoin is $1,000 and the customer wants to pawn a bitcoin, then they send us a bitcoin in exchange for $300 cash, which they can play around with for 30 plus 10 days. So, forty days.  CD: It’s 30% of the bitcoin’s value?  JL: Yes, 30% of the value. And to get their bitcoins back, they just pay a 10% redemption fee and get all of their bitcoins back. 10% of the cash that we advance them. So on a $1,000 coin, they get $300 cash advance and they would pay $330 to get their bitcoin back.  CD: Who is the type of person that would want to use this type of service? How did you come up with this idea?  JL: I see a space in the market for this. And I’m sure people will think of a lot more ways to utilize this functionality.  Among a lot of bitcoin early adopters, bitcoin might be your first investment. Bitcoin might be the first thing you ever really thought of like, “hey, I can throw money at this and it’s going to be worth a lot more in the future”.  So they might be your average person that just works a 9-5 or maybe like a part time job, or a college student or whatever. Anyone who needs cash to pay a bill or pay rent or whatever the case may be. And they don’t want to sell their bitcoins because they are probably going to be worth more in the future. But at the same time, they need the cash.  You can skip the process of pulling out a line of credit and just pawn your bitcoins. Use your bitcoins as collateral for a cash advance, which you can pay back in a week, two weeks or even a month.  CD: How does volatility play a role in all of this?  JL: From PawnCoin’s perspective, we’re offering customers 30% of the value of their bitcoin. So built into our business model we have room for a 70% drop in the value.  CD: But how do you mitigate that risk?  JL: If at the point where bitcoin loses more than 70% of its value, then we have internal policies to manage spikes or declines and we’re also exploring a hedging option to actually fully mitigate against that risk.  We’re establishing a bitcoin company. We believe that bitcoin will continue to be successful. Hopefully those are just contingency plans that we never have to execute on.  There are a few options that exist in the market for hedging. We haven’t committed to any one of them. So it’s a little bit of figuring out what we need to do and then seeking out people who can help us execute on that.  CD: Have you received any funding yet?  JL: Not yet. So far we have been completely founder-funded.  CD: What does PawnCoin have to do in terms of regulatory compliance?  JL: From a regulatory standpoint, we’re not a money transmitter and we’re not a money services business. So a lot of the concern that bitcoin exchange companies have to deal with, we don’t.  [post-quote]  CD: This kind of reminds me a little bit of the concept of payday loans. Do they not have to register as money transmitters?  JL: I can’t speak to that particular business model. But we’re not lending money. We’re basically buying bitcoins at a discount, and then customers have an option of canceling that sale at the end of the month.  There are a few different ways that pawnbrokers have conducted their business. For some, it is phrased as a loan that they give people and in other jurisdictions it’s this purchase with an option to cancel.  CD: Are you planning on marketing this globally or just in the United States?  JL: We have international ambitions.  CD: Let’s talk a little bit about Buttonwood San Francisco (Every Thursday 7PM at Yerba Buena Gardens, now being held inside at the food court for winter). You started it, right?  JL: Yeah, I organized the first one. I think what I like about the most about Buttonwood is not the cryptocurrency trading, it’s the people that show up. And as the prices have gone up, people have become hesitant to sell because they know that they can get a better price next week.  Or, at least, they believe that they can get a better price next week.

42425211,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvTzh,1387803624,Singapore Regulators: We Will Not Interfere With Bitcoin,"At a time when many central banks and regulators are issuing bitcoin warnings and taking steps to limit bitcoin-related trades, Singapore’s central bank has decided to steer clear of bitcoin, for now at least.  The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) told Singapore-based trading platform Coin Republic that it will not interfere with bitcoin adoption. The authority said: “Whether or not businesses accept bitcoins in exchange for their goods and services is a commercial decision in which MAS does not intervene.”  According to TechInAsia, the statement isn't surprising, as the government has already made it clear that MAS should not regulate virtual currencies like bitcoin. However, the Authority has issued statements on the currency in the past, warning speculators that trading bitcoin was risky back in September.  The latest announcement is in no way an endorsement of bitcoin, but it will go a long way to reassure investors who use Singapore-based bitcoin services like Coin Republic.  Bitcoin's advocates  Coin Republic was founded by David Moskowitz, a zealous advocate of bitcoin who believes the Bitcoin protocol could be employed to make remittances cheaper and to cut costs in various industries.  Moskowitz likes to point out that a number of countries prefer to keep bitcoin open and unregulated, namely Japan and Germany. Singapore appears to be just as open when it comes to bitcoin.  Singapore is a major regional financial services hub and its relaxed attitude towards bitcoin has attracted several bitcoin entrepreneurs and investors. These include GoCoin’s Steve Beauregard, who decided to set up shop in Singapore in April 2013.  Attractions of Singapore  There are a few other factors that make Singapore an attractive location for bitcoin companies. In addition to its burgeoning financial sector, Singapore also has a thriving tech industry, so there is no shortage of skilled IT professionals.  Lastly, the city state has plenty of wealthy expats, along with thousands of migrant workers from neighbouring countries. Moskowitz hopes at least some of them will embrace bitcoin as an alternative to traditional wire transfers for remittances, saving a sizeable amount of money in the process.  Singapore has a reputation for being business-friendly and it simply wants to keep it that way.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | TRADING,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/12/23/singapore-regulators-we-will-not-interfere-with-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a94ee34aa04c759e868ac532b24889500dfb7373-1004x461.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425223,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvUNh,1387796447,Thousands of Hoarded Bitcoins Flood the Block Chain in Mystery Transaction,"The bitcoin block chain threw out an interesting statistic yesterday: there were 134,084,960 'Bitcoin Days Destroyed'.  It's the highest number in bitcoin's history so far, beating the previous four record spikes which reached around 52,000,000 Bitcoin Days Destroyed respectively.  The Blockchain.info chart below emphasises how dramatic that looks. If you filter this data for coins that are at least one year old, it still looks like this (130,990,276).  This means that a lot of older bitcoins moved yesterday – a lot. Who could it be this time? Again, fingers were pointed at the typical large-volume bitcoin holders: old-time miners, large exchanges, the Winklevii, or ""something to do with Silk Road”.  The reality is, we can't know for sure unless there's some other hint.  It's important to note that this figure does not mean 130m bitcoins changed hands. One ""Bitcoin Day"" is added to every coin for every day it doesn't move to another address.  1 BTC, unmoved for a year, will have a score of 365 Bitcoin Days. Spend it, and that 365 score will be wiped, or 'destroyed'.  Bitcoin itself has existed for 4.9 years. A single coin from one of the first blocks, unspent, would have a score of around 1,788 Bitcoin Days.  The fairly obscure and tricky-to-grasp ""Bitcoin Days Destroyed"" metric is essentially one way to tell how much 'actual' activity is happening in the bitcoin economy.  The longer a bitcoin sits around without being used, the number of 'days' it accumulates: 1 coin + 1 day = 1 Bitcoin Day. When the coin is sent somewhere, that accumulated total is said to be 'destroyed'.  This reddit discussion  offers some useful insights on the subject.  Hoarder metrics  For another example: 5 BTC held for one day then spent is 5 days destroyed. That same 5 BTC held for a week (7 days) then spent is 5 x 7 = 35 days destroyed.  If you held them for a whole year, they would have accumulated 1,825 Bitcoin Days. Spend them after that long, and ... bingo! 1,825 Bitcoin Days destroyed (or the accumulated number is 'reset').  A low number of days destroyed means more bitcoins are being hoarded. A high number - especially one as high as 130 million - means a lot of coins just got un-hoarded.  It may not have been 130 million, but that figure divided by even 3 years of Bitcoin Days equals over 118,000 BTC - quite a lot to move all at once.  In the long-term  To measure activity we could simply count the number of transactions, but that tells us nothing about the amount of bitcoins being kept in long-term storage, or bitcoins lost forever due to lost keys, hardware, and other regretful blunders. Seeing old coins come back into circulation is good news, as it means they're not lost.  Counting simple transactions could also allow an individual or small group to manipulate the statistics by moving the same coins round and round.  But back to yesterday's statistic: who was it?  The answer is, we can only speculate. It's probably not from the oldest blocks, which haven't moved at all. It's also important to remember that, just because bitcoins have changed addresses, it doesn't mean that they changed hands, or were exchanged for anything.

42425218,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvUBh,1387789816,You Can Buy a 30% Stake in This Californian Winery With Bitcoins,"Forget about hip-hop albums, you can now buy a 30% stake in a Californian winery in exchange for a few bitcoins.  Mondo Cellars, situated in the rolling hills of Paso Robles, is selling a sizable chunk of its business in an effort to promote the use of bitcoin. It is not a small business, either.  The winery  encompasses 80 acres and it produces white and red blends, including Syrah, Zinfandel and Mourvedre. It also features a small bed and breakfast, along with an on-site tasting room and outdoor event area.  However, it is not just about acquiring a stake in a wine cellar. Mondo hopes to use cryptocurrency to buy inventory, build buildings, plant new vineyards and pave roads.  Mondo wants to find more vendors willing to embrace new currencies, such as bitcoin.  The winery is looking for up to 15 investors willing to buy a 2% stake each. The 2% shares are valued at $100,000 denominated in bitcoin. The investors will not only receive an equity position in the winery, they will also get a few special perks, other than the occasional free bottle of Zinfandel.  Doug Mondo, co-owner of the winery explained:  “Our decision to get much more involved in bitcoin and other cryptocurrency is a lot deeper than just ‘it looks like it is viable,’. It makes sense that bitcoin and other cryptocurrency holders that were early adopters should diversify with a portion of their gains.”  The Mondo brothers are calling on investors to visit in person for a wine tasting experience and personal tour of the grounds.  They recently attended the Inside Bitcoin conference in Las Vegas where potential investors had the chance to chat and sample their wines.  The Mondos argue that many bitcoin investors are simply looking to diversify into tangible assets. Better yet, those tangible assets happen to produce wine and have a cosy bed and breakfast in the heart of California’s wine country.
