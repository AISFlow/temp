Late Thursday, the Securities Commission said it took control of FTX digital assets valued at more than $3.5B as of Nov. 12, because it ""determined that there was a significant risk of imminent dissipation"" if they stayed under FTX's control. That statement did not identify the type of digital assets that were seized. The debtors said they have evidence that ~195M FTT tokens ( FTT-USD ), 1,938 ethereum ( ETH-USD ) and other miscellaneous coins with no substantial value were transferred, without their authorization, after the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Blockchain information shows that that crypto is being held in a single digital wallet on Fireblocks. The value of the cryptocurrency at spot prices at the time of transfer was ~$296M, the debtors said, citing etherscan.io. That value, though, assumes that the FTT tokens ( FTT-USD ) in the wallet could be sold at spot prices at the time. The value of the same crypto at spot prices at 2:00 PM ET on Dec. 30 was ~$167M. ""The FTX Debtors urge the Bahamas Commission to clear up any confusion created by their recent statements and provide the public with accurate information concerning the cryptocurrency seized and how it was valued for the purposes of these statements,"" the debtors' statement said.

The top cryptocurrency is set to end the last week of the year 1.3% lower. The 65% drop contrasts sharply with ~60% gain in 2021 and a whopping fourfold increase in 2020. In 2018, bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) had declined ~74% . 2022 saw the crypto market buckle under the weight of multiple bankruptcies , including the FTX ( FTT-USD ) crash, along with weak risk appetite as the Federal Reserve's aggressive rate hikes spooked investors, who widely expect a recession next year. ""We still expect (bitcoin) volatility to decline and remain cautious,"" said Matrixport U.S. CEO Anthony DeMartino . He noted that the collapse of crypto-related firms this year ""revealed all the inconsistencies we may have noticed but were unwilling to face"". ""Best practices will have to be adhered to as coming up short will reduce access to funding and capital. This new, strict environment will allow for the next stage of growth to occur on a more solid and risk conscious foundation,"" added DeMartino. The crypto market cap currently stands at $795.22B, down 0.04% over Thursday, according to CoinMarketCap . FTX Developments FTX former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried is reportedly expected to enter a plea next week to criminal charges of fraud and misuse of customer funds. SBF revealed that he and FTX co-founder Gary Wang together borrowed over $546M from Alameda Research to buy a 7.6% stake in Robinhood ( HOOD ). The SEC alleged that FTX's venture arm made two $100M investments using customers' money to companies whose names were not disclosed. The Bahamas' securities regulator seized FTX's digital assets valued at more than $3.5B as it ""determined there was a significant risk of imminent dissipation"" if they stayed under FTX's control. Meanwhile, FTX Japan and Liquid Japan are targeting the resumption of withdrawals in February . Other Crypto N ews Argo Blockchain ( ARBK ) said it will sell its Helios mining facility to Galaxy Digital ( OTCPK:BRPHF ) for $65M. ""The lower debt load should provide some relief. However, going forward, ARBK will be subject to hosting fees for its miners at Helios, which will be operated by Galaxy,"" said Jefferies analyst Jonathan Petersen. Crypto exchange Kraken will cease operations in Japan as of January 31 due to market conditions in the country and the global crypto downturn. Bitcoin price Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) dipped 0.2% at $16.59K at 6.07 pm ET, while ether ( ETH-USD ) was flat at $1.20K. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) remained firmly below $17K this week. SA contributor The Digital Trend believes bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) could find a bottom in H1 2023, and rally in H2. ""However, this doesn't mean we will immediately take off towards new highs. More likely, we will see some 'sideways' action for the year's second half.""

6730373,https://newsbtc.com/?p=514270,1672441205,"Bitcoin Investor Sentiment Remains Steady As BTC Stalls At $16,000","Bitcoin investor sentiment has reached a standstill amid struggling prices in the market. While the digital asset continues to hold the $16,000 level, investors have backed off from the market, ensuring no significant movements either up or down, and as a result, investor sentiment hasn’t moved. Bitcoin Investors Still In Fear The crypto Fear & Greed Index shows that bitcoin investor sentiment hasn’t really moved much in the last month. It closed out the month of November at a score of 29 which put it right in the fear territory but since then has been unable to break out of this trend. Related Reading: Solana Suffers Double-Digit Losses, Is There An End In Sight? The score on this index over the month of December has staggered between 26-30 for the most part, maintaining a nearly straight-line trend during this period. Even now, the Fear & Greed Index sits at a score of 28 and is up one point from last week’s close of 27. Fear & Greed Index trends in an almost straight line | Source: alternative.me What this trend in the Fear & Greed Index shows is that bitcoin investors are not willing to take any risk. This is why the index has been unable to move into the greed territory. On the flip side, sell sentiment has not been as strong as expected during a time like this. If investors were selling more of their bitcoin, then it would have been obvious given that the index would slide further down. Instead, it continues to maintain a near-consistent score level, meaning hold sentiment now dominates the market. Will BTC See A Recovery Soon? Bitcoin is still finding a hard time regaining the momentum it has lost over the past month. This hesitancy from investors to do anything with their tokens has seen the price of the digital asset follow the same path as sentiment. BTC has now refused to move out of the $16,000 price level. BTC price maintains $16,000 level | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com As a result of this, bitcoin volatility has fallen to historical lows. So it is likely that the last two days of the year 2022 will follow this same trend. Recovery should not be expected in any way because momentum will continue to decline as people take a break from the markets to celebrate with family.

Anything below this level would be very bearish and could trigger more declines in the market as bears take control. But a finish above $16,000 strengthens investors’ resolve to hold their coins. BTC is changing hands at a price of $16,519 at the time of this writing. Its price is down 0.43% in the last 24 hours and 2.01% in the last 7 days.

6730372,https://newsbtc.com/?p=514315,1672441204,"Bitcoin Price Remains Stagnated, How Soon Can You Expect A Rebound?","It has been a rough year for Bitcoin and most major altcoins. Over the last 24 hours, Bitcoin lost 1% of its value, which points towards consolidated price action. BTC has not made much progress over the past week either, as the coin only lost 1.6% of its market value. For multiple weeks, the coin has been oscillating between $16,400 and $18,000. The closest support line for the coin stood at $16,000. The technical outlook for Bitcoin depicted mundane price action due to a decline in the buying strength on the one-day chart. Since the price of Bitcoin has remained undecided for quite some time now, sellers have flooded the market, indicating that the coin is headed toward another round of depreciation. The trading volume of Bitcoin has declined considerably, reinforcing that bears were in charge of the asset’s price. If the selling pressure keeps mounting, BTC will soon lose its crucial price level of $16,000. Currently, BTC is down 76% from its all-time high, secured in 2021. Related Reading: Ethereum Finishes 2022 With ATH Correlation To Bitcoin, Despite The Merge Bitcoin Price Analysis: One-Day Chart BTC was trading at $16,550 at the time of writing. Bitcoin was trading close to its immediate support level of $16,000. Going by the technical outlook, the coin might undergo further depreciation before it starts to reverse its price action. Overhead resistance for Bitcoin was $16,900; clearing this could help the crypto reach $17,400 and eventually attempt to breach $18,000. On the flip side, if Bitcoin moves below the current price mark, it will fall through $16,000 and exceed $15,800. The amount of Bitcoin traded in the last session declined, indicating a fall in buying strength for the asset. Technical Analysis BTC traders might again witness a fall in asset prices over the upcoming trading sessions. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) was below the half-line, near the 40-mark, which indicates that sellers outnumbered buyers heavily. RSI had also noted a downtick, signifying further loss of value. Similarly, the BTC price was below the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line, which signals that sellers were driving the price momentum in the market. The SMA also formed a death cross; it is formed when a longer moving average line crosses over a shorter moving average line; in this case, the 50-SMA line was above the 20-SMA line. This sign on the chart is accompanied by the bears strengthening in the market. Other technical indicators have also pointed out that sellers are here to stay a little longer. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicates price momentum and reversals. MACD depicted a sell signal as the indicator noted red signal bars after undergoing a bearish crossover. The sell signal could mean that the price would depreciate further. The Directional Movement Index, which portrays the price direction, was negative. The -DI (orange) line was above the +DI (blue) line. The Average Directional Index (red) was near the 20-mark with an uptick, emphasizing that bearish action could gain momentum over the immediate trading sessions.

Valkyrie, one of Grayscale’s rivals, previously launched a bitcoin trust and a bitcoin-related exchange-traded-fund (ETF) in 2021. As part of their plan to sponsor GBTC, the world’s largest bitcoin fund, the Tennessee-based company also announced the launch of a new fund, the Valkyrie Opportunistic Fund, LP that seeks to take advantage of GBTC’s discount to the value of its underlying bitcoin, the company said.  Valkyrie’s plan would be a tall order, considering that GBTC alone has over $10 billion in assets and Valkyrie only handles roughly $180 million in total assets.  “We understand that Grayscale has played an important role in the development and growth of the bitcoin ecosystem with the launch of GBTC, and we respect the team and the work that they have done,” Valkyrie said. “However, in light of recent events involving Grayscale and its family of affiliated companies, it is time for a change.”  Grayscale and CoinDesk are both owned by the Digital Currency Group.  In its proposal, Valkyrie said it wants to facilitate GBTC redemptions at net asset value (NAV) for investors through a Regulation M filing. It also proposes to lower the fees to 75 basis points as opposed to the current 200 basis points, and to offer redemptions in both bitcoin and cash.  Earlier this month, GBTC shares hit a record-high discount rate of over 50% relative to the price of bitcoin (BTC). GBTC’s recent struggles were triggered by the Security and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) reiteration of its reasons for denying Grayscale Investment’s application to convert GBTC into a spot bitcoin ETF.

Over the past month, the coin has breached several important price floors. After trading sideways for a while, MATIC lost buyers further, which made the coin fall on its chart again. For Polygon, the most important price floor currently stands at $0.74. If MATIC loses that support line, the coin can register a significant decline of 14%. The market capitalization of MATIC also declined over the past few weeks, which depicts bearishness for the coin. Currently, the coin is trading 74% below its all-time high secured one year ago.

The coin was trading extremely close to the immediate support line of $0.74; one push from the sellers and the price could take another significant bearish turn. Overhead resistance for MATIC was $0.81; crossing this price level will help the altcoin reach $0.84. The $0.84 level has previously acted as a propelling point for the asset’s price, so this could mean that moving above the $0.84 level would help the coin reverse its price action. On the other hand, a fall from the present price mark will bring the altcoin to $0.67 and then to $0.63. The amount of Polygon traded in the last session was red, indicating selling dominance. Technical Analysis The coin was in the seller’s dominant zone for most of this month. The coin barely recovered after it lost the $0.84 support line. The Relative Strength Index was below the 40-mark, which depicted that the coin received more sellers than buyers. In correspondence with the same, the coin moved below the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line. This meant that the sellers were driving the price momentum in the market. Usually, when the coin hovers too close to the oversold zone, the price reverses. If demand returns, the coin will move above the 200-SMA line (green), which points towards a potential rally. Regarding selling strength, the indicators pointed out that the selling spree is not over yet. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator depicts price momentum and reversals. MACD showed red signal bars, which are tied to a sell signal. This was an indication that the coin could dip further on the chart. The Chaikin Money Flow reads capital inflows and outflows; the indicator was below the half-line, signifying lower capital inflows than outflows.

Bitcoin could find a bottom in the first half of the year and rally in the second half. Bitcoin will die in 2023 only to, once again, come back to life. Thesis Summary Bitcoin (BTC-USD) started 2022 around $44,000 with most analysts believing that the mythical $100,000 would be broken in the ensuing months. Instead, Bitcoin sits today at just under $17,000, in the midst of a historically deep bear market. 2023 promises to be a challenging year for Bitcoin as the world's premier cryptocurrency stares at not one but two ""death crosses"". Bitcoin is in for a rough start of the year, but I believe that in the next few months Bitcoin could find an all-time low, and begin its next bull phase. With that said, I'd expect a lot of sideways movement before a true crypto rally starts in earnest. Weekly Death Cross Moving averages are commonly used indicators in technical analysis. When the 50 day moving average crosses below the 200 day moving average, this is called a death cross and is considered a bearish indicator. For the first time in Bitcoin's history, it looks like the 50 day moving average may cross below the 200 day moving average, on the weekly chart. Bitcoin weekly chart (TradingView) This could happen in the next few weeks if Bitcoin's price remains at these levels or lower. Furthermore, the RSI is very oversold on the weekly chart, and the MACD also looks ready to give us a bearish crossover. This is all in line with expectations I have laid out before that Bitcoin should find a final bottom at around $14,000 Hash Ribbon Crossover Bitcoin is about to undergo a historic and never seen before bearish crossover, and a few weeks ago, the cryptocurrency also experienced a bearish crossover in the Bitcoin Hash Ribbons . Bitcoin Hash Ribbons (TradingView) The Bitcoin hash ribbons are used to measure the strength in the Bitcoin mining market, but they can also tell us a lot about the Bitcoin price. The hash ribbon indicator comprises a 30 day Moving average and a 60 day Moving average of the hash rate. When the 30 day moving average crosses below the 60 day moving average, this usually indicates miner capitulation, while a crossover of the 30 day moving average above the 60 day moving average is seen as a positive signal. Back in August, we got a bullish crossover but last month we once again saw the 30 day moving average go below the 60 day moving average. Miner capitulation could lead to increased selling pressure for Bitcoin, which could accelerate the current sell-off. What's in Store for 2023? Despite the currently bearish outlook for Bitcoin, I am still bullish for Bitcoin in 2023. Bitcoin should find a bottom in the year's first half. However, this doesn't mean that we will immediately take off towards new highs. More likely, we will see some ""sideways"" action for the year's second half, like we saw in the previous Bitcoin cycle. Bitcoin price chart (TradingView) Let's take a walk down memory lane. Back in 2017-2018, Bitcoin was at the height of a bullish rally, where Bitcoin's price neared $20,000. However, over the next 12 months, Bitcoin's price began a descent which would see the cryptocurrency lose over 80% of its value. In December 2018, Bitcoin bottomed just above $3000. Over the next few months Bitcoin's price more than quadrupled, only to then be followed by a sell-off which would see Bitcoin retest the lows it made in December. Bitcoin retraced nearly 88.7% before it put in a solid bottom, after which we saw a fast and furious rally that took Bitcoin to new all-time highs in 2021. This type of price action is typical of the Bitcoin cycle and of an Elliott Wave impulse, where wave 1 is followed by wave 2, which can retrace a significant amount. Only after this 1-2 setup, are we ready to rally convincingly in a wave 3 towards new highs. I expect Bitcoin to follow a similar pattern after it finds a bottom in the year's first half. Takeaway In conclusion, Bitcoin's start to 2023 should be a mirror image of the start it got in 2022. When everyone was looking for a rally to new all-time highs, we got a massive sell-off. Now, just as everyone is expecting Bitcoin to crash and burn, I believe the cryptocurrency is set to give us a significant rally once it finds a bottom in the next few months. This rally could provide us with a significant investment opportunity since Bitcoin's price could easily double or triple in a matter of months. However, following this, I would expect Bitcoin to give us a final opportunity to enter the market in a pull-back that could take us near all-time lows later in the year or even into 2024.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4567139-bitcoin-what-expect-2023?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/6723931.jpeg

42410879,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggsDAZ,1672429322,Bitcoin Miners Got Crushed by Crypto Winter. 2023 May Bring More Pain,"The mining industry started 2022 off strong with what seemed like ample capital to expand, but high energy prices, increasing competition for Bitcoin blocks and a bear market hit miners, knocking out those with high leverage.  The sector was shaken by bankruptcies and loan defaults, and next year will likely bring even more pain, as miners struggle to bolster their balance sheets and operations. But it will also present an opportunity for those in a position to buy assets, as well as for those that can improve their margins with new innovations.  CoinDesk spoke to some of the top executives and analysts in bitcoin mining to review past year and predict trends for 2023. Here’s what they said.  Growth didn’t come in 2022  Industry participants say that lots of money was spent over the last year to boost hashrate, a measure of computing power on the Bitcoin network, but that in many cases, those investments didn’t pay off, as companies loaded up on debt to finance the growth only to see the economics of crypto mining break down.  ""Many miners acted too deterministically,"" projecting bitcoin (BTC) would hit $100,000 and not even considering that the price would drop below $20,000, said Juri Bulovic, head of mining at crypto mining and staking firm Foundry, which is owned by CoinDesk’s parent company, Digital Currency Group.  With falling bitcoin prices, many companies had trouble meeting their debt obligations.  Read more: Bitcoin Miners’ FTX Contagion Exposure May Amplify Industry Pain  ""There aren’t many ways to financially materialize those plans. One either sells bitcoin, borrows debts or issues equity. When selling mined bitcoin was barely enough to cover OpEx (operating expenses), many opted for debt financing as the equity market turned cold,"" said Wolfie Zhao, head of research at TheMinerMag, the data and research arm of mining consultancy BlocksBridge.  Read more: Crypto Miners Face Margin Calls, Defaults as Debt Comes Due in Bear Market  On the flip slide, lenders were too optimistic.  ""Many had not been able to properly assess the risks associated with such mining rigs-backed loans given that this is the first cycle in which such loans were given out,"" Bulovic noted.  Some miners saw their debt-to-equity ratio, a measure that shows a company’s financial leverage, more than triple in the third quarter, according to TheMinerMag data.  Unsurprisingly, miners that had high debt-to-equity ratios, like Core Scientific (CORZ), Greenidge Generation (GREE) and Stronghold Digital Mining have had to either file for bankruptcy or restructure their debt obligations.  Hedging and treasury management  Many miners also failed to hedge their risks against a falling bitcoin price.  “Bitcoin miners have much to learn from traditional commodity-producing industries like oil and gas. Instead of using financial instruments to increase their long oil exposure, oil producers hedge their exposure by selling oil futures. Hopefully, this bear market will inspire miners to decrease their bitcoin price risk through more sophisticated risk management,” Jaran Mellerud, an analyst at Luxor Technologies, a provider of bitcoin-mining services, said. Luxor opened a derivatives desk to sell hedging products to miners in October, although the idea of hedging with derivatives had already started to sow its seeds within the miners as the broader market crumbled.  ""I really think investors want two things – they want transparency and they want predictability – and that's what hedging brings to a miner,"" said Chris Bae, founder and CEO of digital-asset trading firm Enhanced Digital Group. Bae’s firm provides hedging products to miners that are trying to implement risk-management strategies. Other companies such as crypto-focused financial-services firm Galaxy Digital and Singapore-based digital-asset management platform Metalpha are also providing hedging services to miners.  TheMinerMag’s Zhao pointed out that it wasn’t only overleverage that has brought some miners to their knees, but also lack of treasury management.  ""If Core had been selling half of its mined bitcoin every month and holding the rest since January 2021, it likely won't be so troubled as it is now while still having a few K [thousands] of BTC on its balance sheet to capture the long-term upside,"" he said, referring to Core Scientific, a miner that filed for bankruptcy in December.  Instead, the world’s largest miner by hashrate waited ""until May when the market pain started to really kick in"" to start selling its accumulated digital assets, Zhao said.  Miners that had a high proportion of debt relative to their bitcoin production have found themselves under water.  “Five of the six companies with the largest net debts per BTC mined have had some level of restructure since the second half of this year, with the exception of Marathon Digital Holdings,” Zhao said.  The analyst thinks that Marathon has bucked the trend in part because the mining firm raised $750 million last year in unsecured convertible notes with a 1% coupon rate. Core Scientific, by contrast, raised $500 million in secured convertible notes with a 10% rate.  Marathon is also working to reduce its debt obligations, the firm told CoinDesk.  More pain ahead  Still, Jaime Leverton, CEO of Canadian miner Hut 8 (HUT), predicts the worst is yet to come in terms of capitulation and bankruptcies, particularly in the first half of 2023, and she’s not sure that relief will come in the second half.  Luxor’s Vera said he expects many companies to be taken private, saying companies can gain efficiencies by hosting and running machines.  But Fiorenzo Manganiello, founder of Cowa, a mining and venture-funding firm, said buyers may be better off just purchasing bitcoin rather than dealing with hassles of owning and operating machines.  For the rest of the pack, the year looks like a year of survival and recovery.  “Unless we see a full-scale bull market, which I doubt we will, miners will use 2023 to strengthen their balance sheets and improve their operating efficiencies. The year’s biggest trends will be cost minimization and debt reduction,” Mellerud said.  Read more: Bitcoin Miners’ FTX Contagion Exposure May Amplify Industry Pain  Power struggle  In 2023, miners will not only have to find the best energy deals, but get creative about how they can lower their costs or bring in revenue by tweaking their power consumption and supply, industry experts say.  As margins continue to compress, miners will have to look at how they can participate in “demand response programs,” meaning selling power back to the grid in times of high demand, as well as recapturing heat from mining rigs and using stranded energy, Bulovic said. “Miners who have a real grasp on the processes, policies, regulations and technical know-how of these adjacent industries will gain an edge over the other miners,” he said.  Read more: Bitcoin Miners Powered Off as Winter Storm Battered North America  Crypto mining is becoming a bigger part of the energy industry, and by the end of 2023, more companies will need to be vertically integrated, with their own power source in order “to maintain long-term stable operation, as the halving is just getting closer,” according to Daniel Jogg, CEO of Enerhash, a Hungary-based company that runs blockchain data centers. Halving is when the number of bitcoin mined per block drops by 50%.  Another lesson related to the importance of managing power costs is on hosting, the business model in which firms bring in revenue for owning and operating the infrastructure. “High energy prices and low bitcoin prices have been particularly hard on this model,” Zach Bradford, CEO of crypto miner CleanSpark (CLSK) said.  Compute North, the first big firm in the industry to go bankrupt, was primarily a hosting firm. Core Scientific was also losing money in its hosting business – about $10 million in the third quarter.  Read more: ​​Core Scientific Again Raises Bitcoin Mining Hosting Rates  Mining firms like Digihost Technology (DGHI), Greenidge Generation and Argo Blockchain (ARBK) that relied on natural gas or the electricity grid for their power, saw their costs skyrocket in the third quarter, according to the data from TheMinerMag.  The trend of cost per bitcoin produced over the year “looks very similar to the U.S average household energy price increase this year. The average of all the major mining companies' cost of production per BTC mined has gone up by 7% in Q3 compared to Q1,” Zhao said.  New technology  As miners try to become more efficient and bring down power costs, they might end up taking a counterintuitive path – underclocking mining machines. That’s the practice of “reducing energy consumption and total hashrate to improve energy efficiency,” which is “one of the best and most readily available technologies” to improve efficiencies and control costs, Ben Gagnon, chief mining officer at Canadian miner Bitfarms (BITF), said.  Nascent technologies like immersion and hydro cooling are also becoming more popular, but it is uncertain whether miners will deploy them at scale in the future because of cost concerns.  Immersion cooling entails submerging mining machines in a tank of fluid, whereas hydro cooling entails a new generation of mining rig, which are heavily promoted by Bitmain, the world’s largest mining machine equipment manufacturer. Hydro machines have tubes placed close to the chips. Fluids go through these tubes, taking heat out of the machine. These rigs require a special infrastructure to run, and often to treat the water such that it doesn’t degrade the tubes over time.  Read more: Amid Market Rout, Crypto Miners Are Still Building  “Even though the current mining economics has disincentivized miners from experimenting with these new technologies, we do expect to still see progress being made in 2023 to advance the technology and lower costs,” Foundry’s Bulovic said.  Aydin Kilic, president and chief operating officer at Canadian crypto miner Hive Blockchain (HIVE), touted the Hive Buzzminers, a new mining rig built using Intel’s (INTC) highly anticipated Blocksale chip. These mining machines will be the first ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) miner deployed by any of the major public crypto mining companies and designed in-house, he said.  The evolving geography of mining  The past year started with a noticeable centralization of the bitcoin mining hashrate in the U.S. In January, the U.S. accounted for about 38% of computing power on the Bitcoin blockchain, and Canada almost 7%, according to the Centre for Alternative Finance at the University of Cambridge. Next year, that trend might be broken. Luxor’s Mellerud and Chief Operating Officer Ethan Vera both expect miners to migrate to South America, the Middle East and Southeast Asia because those regions have cheaper electricity.  Hut 8’s Leverton said that this decentralization is her “hope,” given that bitcoin is supposed to be a distributed network, not aggregated in one particular jurisdiction, although she noted that political instability could be an obstacle in some countries.  Read more: Bitcoin Miners’ High Hopes for Latin America Dented by Paraguay  Environmental concerns  Many places are concerned about bitcoin mining’s energy use and its impact on local communities, and in 2022, they started setting limits.  In the past year, New York state enacted a two-year moratorium on new bitcoin mining operations, lawmakers in the U.S. are targeting the industry’s energy use, utilities in three Canadian provinces have stopped approving new bitcoin mining connections to the grid, and a bill is under consideration in Kazakhstan that will cap the energy available to miners.  Industry experts said they don’t expect any regulation on the federal level in the U.S. or Canada in the coming year, but local or state governments might continue to place restrictions on the industry.  Gagnon of Bitfarms sees this small-scale regulation as an important testing ground for any federal laws to come in the years ahead.  Vera, however, cautioned that the moratorium set by New York state “sets a challenging precedent” for the rest of the U.S. for expansion of new mining farms. New site developments across states controlled by Democrats are likely to be targeted by regulation, he said.  Mellerud said that in Europe, the European Union regulators will be “more aggressive toward bitcoin miners in 2023.”  As the continent “struggles with its energy crisis, energy-intensive industries like bitcoin miners become natural scapegoats that regulators could target to score some cheap political point,” he said.

42421415,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXo3cT,1672428883,"FTX, Congress, Stablecoins: What 2023 May Bring for Crypto Regulations","Can you believe this year started off with U.S. law enforcement officials arresting two individuals in connection with the 2016 Bitfinex hacked funds? For this week’s newsletter, the 102nd since we first launched in 2021, I asked CoinDesk’s Policy Team what they’re looking out for this upcoming year.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  What a year  The narrative  CoinDesk’s regulation team lays out what we’re looking at this upcoming year.  Why it matters  Crypto’s growing stature in the world will draw increasing amounts of attention from regulators.  Breaking it down  Nikhilesh De (U.S.): This year did not play out quite as expected. While the idea that the bull market would end and a new crypto winter would hit was understood and expected, the sheer scale of this year’s failures seemed to catch a lot of people by surprise.  Next year will not, I suspect, be pretty. Cheyenne Ligon gets into this as well a bit further down, but as the current bankruptcy cases advance and possible new bankruptcies arise, the industry will have to deal more and more with a lot of questions around user privacy and consumer protections.  Whether crypto exchange customers can expect their personal information to remain redacted, should the provider enter bankruptcy, will continue to be a growing question for courts. This year we saw that question arise with companies like Celsius and FTX. Judges initially allowed the companies to file their creditors’ information under seal, but Celsius later released the names and holdings of all of its customers, while FTX is currently going through hearings about the same issue.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may also be gearing up to force exchanges into compliance with existing rules. SEC Chair Gary Gensler has long said he believes his agency has the authority it needs to regulate crypto companies, and that the law is clear in his view that most cryptocurrencies are securities and therefore more crypto exchanges are securities trading platforms. More recently, the SEC has suggested that it may be moving closer to actually doing something about this; Enforcement Director Gurbir Grewal said the runway for crypto companies is getting shorter, and the collapse of FTX has heightened the pressure for regulators to get a hold of this industry before something else falls apart.  I don’t expect too much in the way of legislative activity. While I know we’ll see additional bills introduced, including the highly anticipated stablecoin legislation from the House Financial Services Committee, the bigger question remains whether there will be enough bipartisan support in both the House and the Senate to actually pass anything into law. Jesse Hamilton provides his own view on legislation further down.  That being said, it’s hard to say this year was anything but a black mark for the industry in the eyes of regulators. The collapse of Terra/Luna, the bankruptcies of basically the entire crypto lender sector (minus Nexo, which still ended up leaving the U.S.), the meltdown of FTX (the largest exchange failure in years) – these are all events that will pressure regulators worldwide. The Facebook (now Meta)-led Libra (later Diem) project and the global backlash to it tells us how regulators may respond as well. It may not be a quick response, but years after Facebook first introduced Libra, lawmakers from different nations developed stablecoin regulations to rein in the sector. I suspect we’ll see a similar response in reaction to this year’s events.  Sandali Handagama (EMEA): This past year did not just test the prowess of global crypto companies and markets, but also the relatively new regulatory frameworks designed to govern the space. As high profile entities from Terraform Labs to FTX fell one after the other, the regulators they were linked to, be it in the Bahamas or Singapore, were also put on the spot.  Singapore, which boasted a sophisticated regulatory regime for crypto firms, faced tough questions on how its central bank decided which platforms were safe for investors after it flagged rival exchange Binance but not the now-bankrupt FTX.  In the European Union, lawmakers questioned if their landmark Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) framework, hailed as a global standard for crypto regulation, could really prevent an FTX-style collapse, which had over 100 entities operating in multiple jurisdictions while registered in the Bahamas.  The cross-border nature of crypto warrants global cooperation on regulations, international bodies like the International Monetary Fund and the Financial Stability Board have said. The push for global standards for crypto only intensified as the markets went from bad to worse this year. In 2023, we’ll hear more about a global push for oversight and perhaps watch international leaders tackle a tougher question – are regulations enough?  Jesse Hamilton (U.S.): If crypto has a future as a widespread, commonly exchanged asset, that future could be decided this year in Washington, D.C.  The policy work is coming to a head, including with the U.S. Federal Reserve’s eventual decision on whether the government should step into the field with a digital dollar and a number of legislative efforts that could finally set down national rules for stablecoins and crypto trading that will secure a place for digital assets in the U.S. financial system. That comes with a price, of course, and it may be too high for some in the industry.  This regulatory reckoning comes as many U.S. lawmakers and the heads of agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are particularly skeptical about the way things are run in crypto world, and the latest crisis with FTX could mean more stringent oversight than what lawmakers contemplated in the first few bills that started the debate. Meanwhile, if the SEC retains the authority to define what makes a token a security (and so far, Chair Gary Gensler says most of them are), that agency will hold token issuers and exchanges to existing securities law, which never foresaw decentralized crypto assets.  The new Congress may take a while to settle in during 2023, so it could be months before the Senate (still controlled by Democrats) and the House of Representatives (newly piloted by Republicans) will find common ground on crypto. The effort that may be farthest along is the House Financial Services Committee’s bipartisan stablecoin regulation bill, so that relatively narrow legislation could test whether crypto is among the limited range of issues that a divided government can move forward on. The two parties, several committees and a lot of crypto-doubting lawmakers have to be brought together before the industry can finally get more comprehensive regulation.  While Congress works on that, U.S. financial agency chiefs who make up the Financial Stability Oversight Council could use that group’s powers to formally declare crypto activities such as stablecoins as systemically important, which could give the Fed or others some regulatory authority there. And apart from the onset of significant enforcement actions likely coming from the SEC in 2023, lesser-known agencies such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau could also start imposing their powers over the financial products offered by crypto firms.  Cheyenne Ligon (U.S.): The spectacular downfall of FTX in November – which saw the world’s second-largest crypto exchange reduced to rubble in little more than a week – was certainly the largest and most shocking failure of 2022, but it was far from this year’s only crypto collapse.  The FTX drama has had the secondary effect of drawing attention away from the failures that came before it – including the depegging and subsequent implosion of algorithmic stablecoin issuer Terra, the $10 billion wipeout of hedge fund Three Arrows Capital and a wave of other crypto bankruptcies including Celsius Network and Voyager Digital.  FTX’s collapse – and the fall from grace of its former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, who is now facing criminal fraud charges for his role in the alleged scheme – has also overshadowed subsequent bankruptcies (like BlockFi’s) in the wake of its spreading contagion.  The knock-on effects of that contagion has also caused several other major crypto companies including Nexo, Gemini, and Genesis (a sister company of CoinDesk) to wobble while FTX continues to steal the spotlight.  Though 2022 was a major year for crypto bankruptcies, the momentum shows no signs of slowing in 2023. The bankruptcy process is often slow and painstaking, and the bankruptcies that began in 2023 will stretch well into 2023 and perhaps beyond. And, if the dominoes continue to fall (and they almost certainly will), still more crypto companies will join them.  Camomile Shumba (UK): The U.K. was a big story with the political and regulatory turmoil putting into question the crypto hub plans Prime Minister Rishi Sunak set out when he was finance minister. It’s unclear if the political storm has passed with many calling for an early general election which could result in Labour – the current favorite party to win, who may not be as crypto friendly as the current ruling Tory Party – taking charge.  What also is unclear is whether the country's crypto hub ambitions have any real standing when its financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), has a strict stance when it comes to crypto. CEO Nikhil Rathi told lawmakers in a meeting that the FCA had turned away 85% of the crypto companies that tried to register with it to operate in the country.  The Financial Services and Markets bill, which is still being debated in Parliament, will give the FCA powers to regulate crypto and how these companies advertise to U.K. clients. The U.K. government’s finance arm, the Treasury, will set out how best to regulate the industry, beginning with a public consultation. How all this unfolds will indicate how crypto friendly the U.K. will be.  Lavender Au (APAC): Regulatory frameworks are starting to firm up in Asia. This year, Hong Kong passed its licensing regime on exchanges and South Korea put together a bill to govern digital assets. 2022 was also a year of adjustments. Japan committed to relaxing tax regulations, which effectively made it impossible to issue tokens in the country. Singapore considered tightening regulations to reduce risk to retail investors.  Strict regulations in the region also mean there’s business in finding ways to dodge them. Investors in Japan use gray OTC channels to avoid high taxes. China’s investors continue to onramp — an estimated 8% of FTX users were based in the country, according to a chart shown at its first bankruptcy hearing.  As in other regions, the collapses of Luna and FTX added urgency to regulatory efforts. Next year, Asian regulators will issue regulatory frameworks on stablecoins. Soft consultations in Hong Kong will continue on requirements for allowing retail to invest. Both Japan and Singapore have indicated that they are looking into regulating DeFi.  This year, to enter local markets, exchanges with a global presence have snapped up smaller local regulated exchanges (see Binance’s acquisition of Sakura in Japan and Tokocrypto in Indonesia). More mergers and acquisitions are likely in 2023, as larger players look to snap up more local players.  Jack Schickler (EU): The Markets in Crypto Assets law made the European Union the first major jurisdiction with a legal framework for the sector. As various shocks hit in 2022, EU regulators vaunted their new consumer protection and financial stability rules – which, they said, ensure stablecoins have decent reserves (side-eye to terraUSD) and that crypto exchanges are properly governed (I’m looking at you, FTX).  2023 presents a fork in the road for crypto companies. Register with authorities under MiCA, and you get legitimacy: the right to advertise within the bloc, official approval to persuade people you aren’t the next FTX, connections to traditional finance that helps onramp new clients.  But if an exchange or wallet provider doesn’t want to jump through all those regulatory hoops, it can still sell crypto in the EU by a loophole known as reverse solicitation. Offshore providers could also offer less scrupulous clients tempting extra features, like not reporting their holdings to EU tax authorities.  Lately the trend seemed to be in favor of increasing regulatory compliance; Binance, which once boasted that it had no headquarters, has now set up entities in Cyprus, France, Spain and Italy as it prepares for MiCA to take effect in 2024. But crypto companies will all be looking over their shoulders as they take decisions: no company wants its competitors to be getting an unfair advantage. Which way will they jump?  Amitoj Singh (India): In 2023, Indian crypto enthusiasts will have their eyes on three major events.  First, the annual budget announcement, which could see India change its crypto taxation policy. A 30% tax on crypto profits and a 1% tax deducted at source (TDS) on all transactions, among other macroeconomic factors, had a brutal impact on trading in India. The industry has asked the government to reconsider these rules.  Second, India will host the Group of 20 (G-20) nations in September 2023 in New Delhi. When India assumed the G-20 presidency in Dec. 2022, it stated that framing globally coordinated crypto rules would be a priority. Deliberations between the G-20 nations have begun and will culminate during the summit with the expectation that the world’s largest economies settle on a globally acceptable crypto regulation framework.  Third, the nation’s central bank hopes to launch its CBDC on a full scale by the end of 2023. Currently, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has commenced its pilot in four cities with the participation of four major cities. The pilot's progress will determine the future of India’s digital rupee and potentially contribute to the globally acceptable standards around the use cases of CBDCs.  Looking back  A year ago, I asked my team – then the newly created regulatory team at CoinDesk – what everyone would monitor over the course of 2022.  Sandali Handagama highlighted the European Union’s Markets in Crypto Assets framework, which lawmakers advanced this year. Elsewhere, a digital euro is still under discussion but is still a ways from realization.  Cheyenne Ligon said she expected to see “an uptick in the number of criminal probes” tied to crypto, alongside other court cases such as the sentencing of Ethereum developer Virgil Griffith. We did indeed see a rise in the profiles of SEC and CFTC enforcement actions, including the SEC explicitly calling several cryptocurrencies securities in an enforcement action against a former Coinbase employee and the CFTC going so far as to sue an entire DAO in an ongoing matter.  Lavender Au said South Korea’s presidential election could lead to a change in how the country approaches digital assets. Japan is similarly advancing its efforts to better understand and legislate cryptocurrencies, like stablecoins, while Hong Kong’s government is seeking to draw in new crypto businesses.  Amitoj Singh said he would watch for how India tried to mitigate crypto risks and tax rules, just ahead of India implementing a fairly strict tax regime that appears to have actually impacted the entire industry within India.  Last year I said I was looking at stablecoin regulation and the bipartisan infrastructure law, as well as whether regulators would act decisively.  We heard about bipartisan stablecoin legislation that seems almost certain to be debated and discussed in the new Congress, even as it fell short of introduction this year.  I also wrote, “Will one of these agencies issue guidance for startups trying to launch in the U.S.? Or will 2022 be a repeat of 2021 and 2020 and 2019 and so on where we hear speeches and see enforcement actions but not much more.”  I guess we have our answer.

BlackRock, which is Core Scientific's largest shareholder according to FactSet data, already held $37.9 million in secured convertible notes as of Wednesday. The latest $17 million is part of the new $75 million convertibles notes, which are part of Core's prearranged bankruptcy process, the filing says. In a prearranged bankruptcy, the debtor reaches some sort of agreement with its creditors before officially filing for bankruptcy.  Core Scientific, the largest miner by computing power, filed for Chapter 11 on Dec. 21. The move comes as miners in general have been squeezed by high energy costs and low bitcoin (BTC) prices. Core noted that it expects support from some of its convertible noteholders in the form of two debtor-in-possession (DIP) facilities, totaling up to $75 million.  According to the restructuring plan, the secured debt convertible noteholders will get equity. The current equity and unsecured holders will get warrants so that as the company grows, they will get more shares, its chief mining officer, Russell Cann, told CoinDesk.  Read more: Inside Core Scientific’s Prearranged Bankruptcy  Out of the total $75 million, the lenders have already committed $57 million, including BlackRock's new loan, to the miner. The DIP facility has a maturity date of June 21, 2023 with terms to extend to Sept. 21, according to the new filing.  Shares of Core Scientific traded at 8 cents on Friday afternoon.  Core first warned of the risk of bankruptcy in late October and said it wouldn't be paying some of its loan installments, sending its shares plummeting about 80% on Nasdaq. In November, it reiterated that it may run out of money by the end of this year. Compute North, another major firm in the mining business, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in late September. Crypto miner Argo Blockchain (ARBK) narrowly avoided bankruptcy after getting a $100 million bailout from Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital this week.

42394479,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bw8KZx,1672427151,What Is an NFT Floor Price?,"If you are evaluating the intrinsic value of a non-fungible token (NFT) in a collection, you may consider several metrics. One is called the floor price, which is usually denominated in cryptocurrencies or in stablecoins pegged to the U.S. dollar.  The number refers to the minimum price a seller wants for an NFT in any given collection. But the usefulness of floor prices is somewhat more complex – and the metric can be manipulated to make a collection seem more popular than it is.  Floor prices explained  OpenSea, the largest NFT marketplace, defines the floor price as “the lowest price for collection items, rather than the average item price.” The metric is updated in real time as sales of NFTs in a collection roll in. The calculation of a floor price typically doesn't include Dutch auctions, where the price of an NFT is reduced until someone is willing to buy it.  The floor price is often a good starting point for understanding the popularity of an NFT collection and its perceived value over time. Collections with a high floor price might be more popular, and dips in floor price might signal that interest in that project is waning.  For instance, as of this writing, the floor price for an NFT in the wildly popular Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) collection on OpenSea is 74.7 ETH, or about $89,450. The floor price of a collection can vary slightly by platform – for example, on Rarible, the floor price for BAYC is 72 ETH (about $86,200).  Because the floor price sets the bar for the value of an NFT within a collection, many NFTs with rare traits will sell for more than the floor price. Ape #8552, which features rare traits like gold fur, sold for 95 wrapped ether (wETH) in July 2021 (worth about $241,470 at the time).  The discrepancy reveals something inherent to non-fungible tokens: Although they may be part of a collection, each digital asset is unique and can sell for varying prices, depending on rarity traits or features specific to an individual token. Fluctuations in market conditions can also affect floor prices.  In addition, the term floor price is sometimes used to refer to NFTs grouped by trait. So, someone might say that the floor price for a gold Ape is higher than others, and so on.  It’s pretty easy to find the floor price for a collection. On OpenSea, you can click on an individual collection, and it will show the floor price data next to the collection’s total sales volume and the best offer made by a buyer. On the analytics tab, you can view the project’s floor price over the period of a week. Tools like Nansen’s NFT Paradise or CryptoSlam also provide easy access to floor prices, and Gem aggregates floor prices across different platforms.  Can you rely on the floor price metric?  The floor price simply determines the lowest asking price for a given NFT collection. But that doesn't mean that collectors are willing to buy at that price – or that an NFT is really worth the floor price if you buy it.  Data from Nansen’s NFT Paradise analytics tool helps to illustrate this. Tamadoge Common, an NFT project that was released in October 2022, had a floor price of 200 ETH (about $311,500) on Oct. 24, 2022. That price meant that the owners of the NFTs weren't willing to part with their NFTs for less than 200 ETH. At the time, the trading volume was just 12 ETH, suggesting that no buyer was willing to match the floor price. As of December 2022, the collection has done about 22 ETH (about $26,350) in total sales volume, according to OpenSea, and the floor price is hovering at around 0.2 ETH (about $240).  Now, does that mean that a Tamadoge Common NFT was worth 200 ETH? Not really. Even if you bought it, all the market knows is that you thought it was worth 200 ETH at the time, though you may struggle to find another buyer at that price if you decide to sell.  Just as relevant to collectors is the best offer price, which refers to the maximum amount that other traders are willing to pay for an NFT in the collection. Like a floor price, this figure is constantly updated to reflect the most recent highest offer made by an interested buyer. The difference between the best offer price and the floor price is like a spread in a cryptocurrency trade.  Remember who sets the floor price  It’s important to note that only those who hold NFTs in a collection can set the floor price. Those who set the floor price aren't necessarily reliable arbiters of value. Indeed, they may be working to deceive buyers.  Those who hold NFTs may work together to artificially raise the floor price of a collection by refusing to sell for anything less than an agreed price. For example, if I conspired with other holders of a particular NFT collection to not sell our NFTs below 100 ETH, even though that number is artificially inflated beyond the collection's actual value, we could deceptively increase the floor price.  Related is a term called “sweeping the floor,” which refers to the act of purchasing multiple NFTs in a collection at its floor price. If a buyer sweeps the floor, it may imply that the project is gaining momentum, though it could also signal an effort by a single entity to manipulate the floor price.  Another form of manipulation is called wash trading, where the buyer and seller in a transaction are the same or collude together. For example, an owner of a BAYC NFT might list that NFT at an inflated price and buy it back himself.  Ultimately, floor price can be a useful tool for NFT traders to understand if a collection is gaining popularity and what the entry point is for buying an NFT in that collection.

Ethereum Ends 2022 With All-Time High Correlation To Bitcoin According to the year-end report from Arcane Research, the global markets have all fallen strongly correlated this year. The “30-day correlations” is an indicator that measures how in-tune Bitcoin has been with another asset in terms of price movement over a 30-day period. When the value of this metric is greater than zero, it means there has been a positive correlation between BTC and the other asset in the past month. On the other hand, negative values imply that the price of the crypto has been reacting to changes in the value of the other asset by moving in the opposite direction. Also, the higher the metric value (in either direction), the more the degree of the correlation. Naturally, the metric has a value equal to zero suggesting the two prices aren’t tied to each other at the moment. Related Reading: Analyst Explains Why Ethereum Is Bullish Against Bitcoin Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in Bitcoin’s 30-day correlations with Ethereum, S&P 500, and Nasdaq over the past year: Looks like the metric's value corresponding to ETH has been very high in recent weeks | Source: Arcane Research's 2022 - Year in Review As the above graph displays, Bitcoin positively correlated with these three assets during 2022. BTC’s correlation has been around or above 0.5 for most of the year for the US equities, suggesting it has been decently tied with them. The correlation with Ethereum, however, has been at values of around 0.9 or more, implying Bitcoin has been extremely correlated with it. Even now, as the year’s end, the correlation between these cryptos stands at 0.97, around ATH levels. Back in September of this year, ETH successfully finished its much-anticipated transition to a Proof-of-Stake consensus system, an event known as the Merge. Since the Merge brought some developments unique to Ethereum, the correlation with BTC dropped, as is apparent in the chart. However, it wasn’t long before the two started moving on the same wavelength again, so even the Merge wasn’t enough to cause sufficient impact to separate the coins. Related Reading: Most Public Crypto Firms Underperformed Bitcoin In 2022, Miners Hit Worst Also, since Bitcoin is highly correlated with stocks, so is Ethereum. Though, Arcane Research expects that this correlation between the cryptos and the US equities will soften in the next year due to trading volumes in the crypto market declining substantially.

Ovie Faruq, who is also known as OSF, told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” on Thursday that once that happens, equities will have room to rally, giving digital collectibles the runway to rise again.  “What most of the NFT market has realized is that it's this hybrid asset,” said Faruq, a former credit derivatives trader at Barclays. “But it is correlated to crypto, which is correlated to Nasdaq, which is correlated to global financial markets.”  Read more: Most Influential Artist: Ovie Faruq  According to blockchain data tracker CryptoSlam, global NFT sales declined by 89% in November from a peak of $5 billion in January, Bloomberg reported.  The nosedive in NFTs sales is influenced by the Fed raising interest rates in the face of all-time high inflation coupled with “tourist money” swiftly leaving the market. That leaves retail investors in a tough spot, according to Faruq.  Nonetheless, NFTs may have increased utility down the road as users move toward digital identities.  “This general change in secular trends, that's something that will not change and will continue to escalate and become a larger part of our lives,” Faruq said.  The 33-year-old recently created “Market Wizards” for CoinDesk’s Most Influential 2022, which features four of crypto's biggest scammers.

We will talk with multiple guests to understand this year’s highs and lows for crypto. Related Reading: A Crypto Holiday Special: Past, Present, And Future With Ex BNY Mellon David Schwed In the spirit of Charles Dicken’s classic, “A Christmas Carol,” we’ll look into crypto from different angles, look at its possible trajectory for 2023 and find common ground amongst these different views of an industry that might support the future of finances. Zhou: “It won’t be business as usual for centralized exchanges. For one, the days of commingling users and the exchanges’ assets are long gone.” We are ending our institutional round with Wei Zhou; he worked as Chief Financial Officer for three years at the largest crypto exchange worldwide, Binance. Above the rest, this company and its current CEO, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, heavily impacted the nascent industry and will continue to exercise influence in the coming years. Zhou: “Bitcoin, just like the Internet, will survive any storm that comes its way; this I have no inkling of doubt about.” Zhou reviews the biggest moment in 2022 from his unique perspective. In addition, he talks about the fundamentals that will keep crypto alive and on track to fulfill its destiny. This is what he told us: Q: What’s the most significant difference for the crypto market today compared to Christmas 2021? Beyond the price of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others, what changed from that moment of euphoria to today’s perpetual fear? Has there been a decline in adoption and liquidity? Are fundamentals still valid? A: The crypto market has certainly changed a lot in the past year. Collapse of key industry players I think the biggest change this year has been due to the collapse of some key industry players, from Celsius, 3AC to BlockFi and most recently FTX. With billions of dollars affected, investors have become cautious. The collapse of these giants has served to remind us to be prudent and diligent with our crypto investment decisions. Users should conduct thorough research and abstain from entities whose licensing and regulatory status is unclear. I believe that the situation will change in 2023 and that investor confidence will resume, but we can’t afford to forget the lessons learned this year. Liquidity affected but adoption will continue to grow With the collapse of a big market maker like FTX, liquidity in the market was affected as several exchanges relied on it. Investors have also pulled quite a bit of their money from exchanges which further escalated the liquidity crunch. Speculative trading may have pulled back, but for those to whom crypto was more focused on use cases like value transfer, web3 gaming and financial inclusion, crypto adoption will continue to surge especially in the Philippines. Q: What are the dominant narratives driving this change in market conditions? And what should be the narrative today? What are most people overlooking? We saw a major crypto exchange blowing up, a hedge fund thought to be untouchable, and an ecosystem that promised a financial utopia. Is Crypto still the future of finance, or should the community pursue a new vision? A: This year’s market downturn has fueled crypto skeptics and several mainstream media houses who have become re-energized in their fight against crypto. This narrative has put doubts in the minds of investors. However, most people are overlooking that Bitcoin is designed to be a decentralized electronic currency. Crypto is still the future of finance. If you recall, when the dot-com bubble burst, there were all manner of questions about the viability of the Internet as a technology and the companies building on it. But look at Amazon, Facebook, Google and others today – they are defining the world we live in. This is because, despite the shake-ups with the market players, the underlying technology was fundamentally transformative. Bitcoin, just like the Internet, will survive this winter. Q: If you must choose one, what do you think was a significant moment for crypto in 2022? And will the industry feel its consequences across 2023? Where do you see the industry next Christmas? Will it survive this winter? Mainstream is once again declaring the death of the industry. Will they finally get it right? A: I would point to the FTX collapse as a landmark moment. Its impact has been and will continue to be felt in the industry. Investors are keener about who they trust with their assets and how custodians and exchanges store the assets. Investors are now exploring self-custody solutions, which contrary to opinion I think is a great direction to take. When they require to trade their assets, they are now keen to work with exchanges that are fully regulated like Coins.ph which is licensed by the Philippines central bank and is regularly audited. Regulators are more concerned about the industry. We will also see a trend where regulators around the world will begin to create a more comprehensive regulatory framework around cryptocurrency. The crypto industry has gone through worse. In 2017, the crypto markets peaked and crashed to $3,000, and the industry endured a three-year-long crypto winter. In 2022, we now have institutional investors who are advancing the sector, unlike during prior winters. I believe the industry will survive because there are now much more use cases than there were in the past. Q: What’s next for exchanges such as Binance in 2023 and beyond? Do you think the recent events with FTX will jeopardize the future of these platforms? Many are already speculating about the shift in liquidity from Centralize to Decentralize Exchanges (DEX) due to the users’ lack of confidence in the former A: The days of commingling users and the exchanges’ assets are long gone. FTX has woken up the entire industry to the dangers this practice can have. Proof of reserves is already becoming a big trend as more investors ask questions about how and where their assets are stored. Related Reading: A Crypto Holiday Special: Past, Present, And Future With Blofin Regulators are also cracking down much harder on exchanges. In the Philippines, for instance, the BSP was quick to audit exchanges in order to probe if they had been exposed to the FTX contagion. Thankfully, neither Coins.ph nor our peers were exposed to FTX. The crypto industry will be shifting to focus on Web3, decentralized exchanges and self-custody. More users are now exploring wallets that give them full ownership of their crypto. I am a big supporter of self-custody for those with the technical ability to do it successfully.

6716672,https://seekingalpha.com/news/3920784-innovation-evangelist-cathie-wood-saw-her-arkk-etf-plunge-nearly-70-in-2022?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1672423200,Predicting ARKK’s 2022 Collapse: Cathie Wood's ETF plunged 67% for the year,"Cathie Wood’s flagship ARK Innovation ETF ( NYSEARCA: ARKK ) became a popular proxy for the tech and innovation boom that accompanied the pandemic, with COVID shutdowns spotlighting the promise of the sector. Meanwhile, aggressive government stimulus provided fuel for a rally that lasted most of 2020 and the first few months of 2021. However, 2022 saw a massive retrenchment, as the lifting of pandemic demand and the aggressive rise in interest rates put the pinch on more speculative names. As a result, ARKK collapsed by about 67% in 2022 –- making it one of the year’s biggest stories. Predicting ARKK’s 2022 Collapse Here are Seeking Alpha editors’ picks for some of the best contributor work predicting ARKK’s 2022 tumble. Seeking Alpha contributor Chris DeMuth Jr. was among those who clearly saw that 2022 would be marked by a further bursting of ARKK’s innovation bubble, after the ETF already started to unwind during 2021. Back in December of 2021, DeMuth argued that ARKK was a clear-cut sell, stating : “Cinches are rare in the capital markets. ... Over the next five years, [ARKK] won’t compound at 40%... or 30%... or at all. If you own ARKK, sell it; if you don’t own ARKK, short it. Then ignore it and check back in five years."" That prediction proved spectacularly correct. ARKK fell around 67% in 2022. As of December 30, the ETF closed trading just below above $31 -- compared to an all-time high of $159.70 reached in February of 2021. The fund finished 2021 at $94.59. Fellow SA contributor Robert Castellano also predicted a tough 2022 for ARKK. When he released his bearish note in January, Wood's ETF had already been cut in half since its 2021 peak and was, at that point, approaching an 18-month low. However, Castellano saw further downside -- and since his call, ARKK has retreated another 59%. ""Now is not a time to buy ARKK, as there are absolutely no signs the bottom of these ARKK stocks has been reached,"" he stated in a note dated Jan. 20 . ""Don't rely on Cathie Wood."" Around the same time, Pearl Gray Equity and Research, another SA contributor, likewise predicted that the fissures in ARKK's support would continue to expand. ""I'm well aware that this is an actively managed fund, but it generally owns high price-multiple stocks,"" the contributor noted. ""The issue with high multiple stocks is that they tend to decline rapidly in rising rate environments because the value of their future cash flows gets dissolved exponentially versus value firms."" Inside ARKK’s Decline A look at some of ARKK's top holdings underlines the factors that weighed on the fund. The ETF's top holding is Zoom Video Communications ( ZM ), a stock that surged during the pandemic amid a flood of work-at-home demand but has dropped precipitously after the online video conferencing service was unable to sustain COVID-inflated growth rates. ZM, which has a 9.1% weighting within ARKK, peaked above $580 in October of 2020. As of the close on December 29, 2022, the stock had plunged to $68, recently bouncing off its 52-week low of $63.55. ZM has fallen 63% in 2022. A tour of other heavy investments from Wood's ARK Innovation ETF ( ARKK ) further drives home the dynamics that weighed on the tech sector in 2022. Tesla ( TSLA ), which is ARKK's third-largest holding with weighting of 6.4%, dropped almost 70% in 2022 amid concerns about rising competition in the EV space, ongoing supply chain issues/production snags and the distraction CEO Elon Musk has faced following his acquisition of Twitter. Looking at some of the other lowlights in ARKK's top-ten holdings, Shopify ( SHOP ) has fallen more than 74% as pandemic demand has evaporated from the ecommerce space. Meanwhile, Teladoc Health ( TDOC ), another one-time COVID play, has fallen nearly 75% in 2022. At the same time, Block ( SQ ) has slumped more than 60% amid a reconsideration of the perceived fintech boom. Despite its sharp drop in 2022, ARKK was still able to attract significant investor capital. The fund added inflows of $1.27B over the course of the year. 2022 Walkthrough of ARKK's Performance Never traded higher than +0.5% on the year. Dropped as low as -69.1% . Closed in negative territory in 9 of the 11 months, and another negative close in December is likely. Longest daily winning streak was 5 days. Longest daily losing streak was 7 days (twice). Largest single day gain was +14.5% on November 10th. Largest single day loss was -10.1% on May 11th. ARKK attracted $1.5B worth of investor capital by mid-December. On its eighth birthday (Oct. 31) its lifetime gains dropped below that of the S&P 500 . With the 2022 decline, ARKK plunged to a 5-year trading low . Beyond the performance in ARKK itself, 2022 has put Wood's reputation as a market guru under the microscope. This has come as the money manager continued to tout her holdings, and her overall investing outlook, even in the face of the year's harsh realities. 2022 Notable Cathie Wood Quotes Jan 19 : “In our view, the real bubble could be building in such so-called ‘value’ stocks.” Feb 8 : ""We don't have an inflation problem."" Apr 29 : Wood stated that Teladoc Health ( TDOC ) can be a “category killer during the next five to ten years.” May 5 : ""In my view, history will deem the accelerated shift toward passive funds during the last 20 years as a massive misallocation of capital.” Jun 28 : “We were wrong on one thing and that was inflation being as sustained as it has been.” Aug 8 : ""We believe we're in a recession."" Sept. 8 : “Powell is using Volcker’s sledgehammer and, I believe, making a mistake.” Oct 10 : Wood said that the Federal Reserve could be “making a policy error that will cause deflation” − noting that inflation might have already peaked. Nov 23 : Amongst the FTX collapse, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has come out of this “smelling like roses,” as she stands by her view that Bitcoin will hit $1M per coin by 2030. ARKK is not the only one of Wood's ETFs to come under pressure. Below is a breakdown of Wood’s other ETFs and their year-to-date price action (as of Dec. 29 close): ( ARKW ) -68% , ( ARKQ ) -48% , ( ARKG ) -55% , ( ARKF ) -65% , and ( ARKX ) -35% . Looking to 2023, DeMuth hasn't revisited the ARKK call since making his Strong Sell recommendation in late 2021. However, a number of other SA contributors have continued to take a bearish attitude in recent weeks, even after the sharp fall seen over the previous 12 months. In late December, SA contributor CashFlow Hunter characterized Wood's strategy as "" doubling and tripling down on a losing bet ."" Earlier in the month, On the Pulse issued a similarly dim assessment, declaring "" no end of pain in sight "" for the ETF. Meanwhile, The Value Portfolio has spotlighted the Tuttle Capital Short Innovation ETF ( SARK ), an ETF created to move in an inverse direction as ARKK, and therefore a fund that would profit from further declines in Wood's portfolio.

42421412,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXo3bR,1672422689,5 Lessons From 2022 That Changed Crypto Forever,"For many people, myself included, who were drawn to cryptocurrencies by the prospect of fixing or replacing an exclusionary, extractive, outdated global financial system, the failure in crypto markets this past year has delivered an extremely cold bath.  Now, to be clear, most of the massive financial hit to investors was not due to a failure of technology.  For the Bitcoin blockchain, for example, none of the drama of the past year matters. Every 10 minutes, day in, day out, it adds a block of transactions to its ever-growing ledger. It’s a reminder that the global, decentralized networks of computers running Bitcoin, Ethereum and other permissionless blockchain’s protocols continue to forge systems for intermediary-free value exchange with which no one person or entity can interfere, regardless of the ups and downs of markets. The presence and persistence of these vast autonomous machines continue to leave me awestruck.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  But “crypto” is more than protocols, smart contracts and cryptography. It’s also the community of humans who have gathered around this amalgam of technologies. Without this community, the technology can’t enter real-world adoption and foster change for good. And unfortunately, the failures in 2022 were due to their actions. While a few people in particular are rightly lumped with the bulk of the blame, there is mass collective responsibility here. The theft, deception and staggering breach of trust happened on our watch.  If we are to take lessons from the wealth destruction of 2022, the conclusion cannot be that this is all the fault of Sam Bankman-Fried and his ilk. SBF deserves the prison time he seems sure to receive with his extradition to the U.S., but the real question is how do we create a system – not merely a technological system but one of laws and standards – that makes it much harder for people like him to do what they did.  There is much work to do to build that system in 2023 and beyond. But it starts with the lessons of 2022. There are many. Here are the five that I think are the most important:  1. Crypto does not exist in an economic vacuum.  With all the headlines generated by the collapse of FTX in November, it’s easy to forget that far bigger losses hit cryptocurrency markets in the first months of the year – not because of a crypto-endemic scandal but because the Federal Reserve was hiking interest rates. That put an end to the surfeit of dollars pouring into speculative assets around the world, including cryptocurrencies. The macro environment matters.  2. Leverage, taken too far, always leads to contagion.  The domino effect, seen when the failure of one crypto institution quickly spreads to another, is hardly without precedent. It was there in the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the 1998 Long-Term Capital Management collapse, the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis and many other such moments in financial history. They all had the same characteristics: an overly bullish belief in the upward momentum of financial assets fueled an excessive buildup of loans to speculators. When those beliefs proved unfounded, the rush to the exits exposed an interdependent network of creditors and debtors as they dragged each other down in unison. Crypto speculation was never going to be immune from this, regardless of the decentralized nature of the underlying protocols.  3. DeFi is resilient, but needs constant economic and technical auditing.  Most of the high-profile collapses in 2022 – FTX, Celsius Network, Voyager Digital, Three Arrows Capital, Genesis – involved custody-holding CeFi (centralized finance) companies that put customer funds at risk. That has galvanized supporters of DeFi (decentralized finance), who rightly note that the most robust decentralized market-making and exchange systems survived, precisely because they lack a trusted intermediary capable of such abuse. (Genesis is owned by Digital Currency Group, which is also CoinDesk's parent company.)  Yet as of October, Chainalysis estimated that DeFi investors had lost a record $3 billion year to date because of smart contract breaches, “rug pulls” by founders, and because the underlying tokenomics of some protocols were deeply flawed. (The destructive collapse in the Terra ecosystem was exemplary of the latter instance.) DeFi is a wild, volatile, confusing, unpredictable place. To achieve widespread participation, it needs a more comprehensive audit model in which trustworthy independent analysts or bounty-hunting developers assess projects’ code security, founder practices and tokenomics.  4. Back to basics: Crypto cannot be sustained on “number go up.”  In 2020 and 2021, when social media-driven meme coins were turning kids into instant millionaires, when DeFi projects were paying yields unavailable anywhere else in the world and when institutional and retail investment sent crypto’s market capitalization up 15-fold to almost reach $3 trillion, we should all have been asking tougher questions. The most important one should have been: what’s underpinning all this?  If we peel back the layers of interlocking protocols and the justifications for the returns they were promising, we’re left with little more than speculation for speculation’s sake. Most of that was built on momentum trading, on “numbers-go-up” expectations. It’s time to get back to basics and seek out real-world utility. Token returns need to point back to actual value cases, whether its cross-border payments, decentralized energy, new marketing models offered by non-fungible tokens (NFTs) or one of many other promising use cases.  5. Crypto needs an informed, independent, hard-hitting press.  Sure, this one’s self-interested, but 2022 proved it to be undeniably true that this industry needs a robust “Fourth Estate” to hold accountable the people and entities working within it. Permissionless blockchains should be viewed as public goods – much as the air we breathe, the water we drink or the highways we drive on are public goods. They must be protected as such, which means there must be transparency (balanced with a respect for individual privacy). And while we are all enormously proud of the catalytic role CoinDesk played in exposing the FTX house of cards, it raises the question of why this wasn’t caught earlier. Answer: There aren’t enough crypto-savvy, professionally managed, independence-protected journalists covering this market. (That’s why we got those naive softball articles from the New York Times and others that glossed over SBF’s fraudulent behavior and got my colleague David Morris fired up.)  Still, here’s a hill I will die on: The requisite transparency isn't something that can be achieved solely through the work of “citizen journalists” on Twitter or elsewhere. Those who claim the FTX debacle was brought to the fore by crowd-sourcing the sleuthing work of ordinary people on social media ignore the fact that the meltdown was triggered by an investigative article by Ian Allison, a trained journalist working within the structure of a professionally run newsroom, with editors and management who have carved out a position of independence from their proprietor to earn the trust of their readers. (CoinDesk is a subsidiary of DCG but operates independently and abides by a core code of ethics.) Before Ian’s piece, where was all that Twitter wisdom-of-the-crowd discovery?  If this industry is to thrive it can’t again be blindsided by revelations of wrongdoing as extreme as those uncovered in 2022. That requires vigilance to transparency and recognition that journalists who dig into issues at relevant institutions are doing a service to the longer-term interests of this industry rather than undermining it.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Michael J.

42388290,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRDMQV,1672420657,"FTX’s International Customers Lawyer Up, Ask Judge to Rule That Customer Assets Aren't Property of FTX Estate","Lawyers representing FTX.com’s non-U.S. customers have joined the bankruptcy fray, filing a motion on Wednesday asking a Delaware judge to rule that customer assets locked in the collapsed exchange are customer property – not property of the FTX estate.  The ad hoc committee of international creditors represents 18 international customers of FTX with a collective $1.94 billion in assets locked on the FTX platform.  The ad hoc committee’s motion, on its face, is straightforward. Unlike other failed crypto lenders including Celsius Network and Voyager Digital, which were both legally allowed to invest customer funds to generate yield, FTX’s terms of service are clear: Customer assets belong to customers, and FTX didn't have the right to touch them.  Despite the unambiguous language of FTX’s terms of service, lawyers for the ad hoc committee say they expect pushback from FTX, which has so far been tight-lipped on the issue of customer funds.  One of the ad hoc committee’s attorneys, Erin Broderick, a Chicago-based lawyer with the firm Eversheds Sutherland, told CoinDesk that one reason FTX could be keeping quiet about what to do with customer funds is that the company’s lawyers and executives could need them to defray operating costs.  “The professional fees in this case are enormous,” Broderick said. “I think they’ll push back ... and part of that is ‘Well, how do you pay fees?’”  FTX’s executives aren’t the only ones who have kept mum about the issue of customer funds – so, too, has the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors. Broderick told CoinDesk that the committee’s silence might be because voicing an opinion on the ownership of customer assets could be a conflict of interest.  “Even though the official committee is composed entirely of FTX.com customers – there’s no U.S. customers, there’s no general unsecured creditors – seeking a determination that assets belong to the customers instead of the estate as a whole could be a conflict of interest,” Broderick said.  Broderick is hopeful, however, that the official committee could throw its weight behind the ad hoc committee’s proposal.  “Now, they can be objective and intervene in support to say ‘Hey, [we] read the papers and that’s right, we want all creditors to be acknowledged for their rightful positions,’” Broderick said. “I think that’s fair. But the fiduciary duties of the official committee – they run to all general unsecured creditors, and the determinations that we’re seeking are with respect to FTX.com customers only.”  Preventing ‘dollarization’  Broderick also said that the ad hoc committee’s motion is trying to prevent the “dollarization” of customer claims, which she said FTX has already taken a step toward by listing the dollar value (not the total amount of cryptocurrency) of customer claims in the creditors matrix.  “But when you dollarize – regardless of what digital asset it is, what form of asset it is – as of the petition date, that is essentially giving the debtors the power to liquidate whatever’s on the exchange and say, ‘This is what you get at the bottom of the market’,” Broderick said. “So it's an important distinction, not just with respect to priorities and distribution timing, but it's really important from a valuation standpoint.”  FTX, a crypto exchange, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in Delaware on Nov. 11 after it unraveled following a CoinDesk report that revealed Alameda Research, an affiliated trading firm, was largely backed by FTT tokens, digital assets that FTX created out of thin air.",NEUTRAL,FTT,EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH | FTT,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/12/30/ftxs-international-customers-lawyer-up-ask-judge-to-rule-that-customer-assets-are-not-property-of-ftx-estate,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c72453360bcbd21ffedb6de0c191b13a296e765c-2914x3000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This goes from buying to selling, and just the way they move their coins. Once again, these whales still hold sway in the market and their activity could spell a bottom signal. Santiment Says Bitcoin Whales Are Selling In a recent community post on the Santiment website, the activity of whales is analyzed in depth. This time around, a look at the balances of large holders shows that they are still selling. These whales who hold between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC have reduced their holdings from almost 8 million BTC back in December 2021 to less than 7 million BTC in December 2022. Related Reading: Dogecoin Beats Bitcoin, Ethereum For Best Performance In Crypto Top 10 Even in the last couple of months, they have reduced their balances by more than 200,000 BTC, showing that they are still selling. Given this sell trend among these large holders, the report predicts that the market will see “sideways or even lower prices for BTC in the next 6-12 months.” BTC whales are still selling | Source: Santiment If this selling from large investors flows into 2023, then it is likely that the digital asset would start out the year seeing prices below $16,000. It is also important to note that the analysis in the report of whale addresses shows that the bottom of the market may not be reached yet. BTC Bottom Is Still Not In Now, the activity of whales is important to watch as accumulation by them could lead to a rally, and vice versa. One of the ways to try to pinpoint the bitcoin bottoms is with whale activity. At the very bottom of a bear market or at least close to it, whale address activities have historically declined. However, the Santiment report notes that the average 7-day transaction count was still hovering around 10,000 presently. Compared to the previous bear markets when the market had marked its bottom, whale transaction counts had declined to 1,200 and 2,500. “This may mean that we need to wait for the average to drop further before we can conclude that even the big players are giving up,” the report reads. BTC price succumbs to selling pressure | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com Another metric that the report points to is volume gaps. These usually show where the whales are accumulating and unfortunately, both volume gaps identified in the report lie well below the current trading price of bitcoin. The two key gaps identified were the $14,600 and $12,200 price levels, which could be a possible accumulation level for whales. Related Reading: Solana Suffers Double-Digit Losses, Is There An End In Sight? Essentially, the advice was to put off buying until whale transactions fall lower, as well as wait for the current selling pressure to subside. “To sum up, the activity of BTC whales and the presence of volume gaps at 14,600 USD and 12,200 USD may be worth watching,” Santiment said.

Most Public Mining Companies Saw Drawdowns Of 90% Or More In 2022 As per the year-end report from Arcane Research, 2022 was a very challenging year for public firms in the crypto sector. The below chart displays the drawdowns in the valuations of some of the big players in the market, as well as that of Bitcoin, during the last twelve months: The deep red performance of the public companies in the digital asset sector | Source: Arcane Research's 2022 - Year in Review As the graph shows, Bitcoin performed terribly this year, seeing negative returns of around 65%, but the large public crypto firms have done worse still. Even Microstrategy, the company whose stocks’ main attraction is exposure to BTC through its large reserves, couldn’t perform comparably to the asset and observed a deeper year-to-date drawdown of about 74%. The market cap of the popular crypto exchange Coinbase has gone down by 87% this year, which has led to the firm being valued lower than meme coin Dogecoin. The worst performer in the list seems to have been Core Scientific, recording a drawdown of 99%. Core Scientific is one of the biggest Bitcoin mining companies, but due to these large losses, the firm had to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy earlier in the month. Similarly to Core, other BTC miners have also sustained major drawdowns this year, with most of them being 90% or more underwater for the period. But why did the mining firms perform especially poorly? The explanation behind that is multifold. Related Reading: Bitcoin Now Under Realized Price For 163 Days, Here’s How This Compares Historically “Similar to how crypto lenders were incentivized to prioritize short-term growth over long-term sound business decisions to attract private capital, public miners were incentivized to take on debt and rapidly expand its hashrate share to attract more capital,” the report explains. But three factors meant that this bet from these companies couldn’t pan out. First, the interest rates kept rising this year. Second, the bear market meant that the price of Bitcoin kept plunging, leading to the value of miners’ rewards also becoming lower. And finally, the third nail in the coffin was the rising energy prices, which resulted in very low or no profits for miners as they have to constantly pay electricity bills to keep their facilities running. All these factors lead to the public miners collapsing under the weight of their short-sighted decisions. Related Reading: Bitcoin Interexchange Flow Pulse About To Reverse, What Does It Mean?

Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's 2023 expansionary budget – which was completed in a rush before the end of the year – features 21 billion euros ($22.3 billion) in tax breaks to assist businesses and households facing the energy crisis, Reuters reported.  In Italy, where crypto remains largely unregulated, the 387-page budget legitimizes crypto assets by defining them as ""a digital representation of value or rights, which can be transferred and stored electronically, using the technology of distributed ledger or similar technology.""  Italy's (and most recently Portugal's) move to introduce a capital-gains tax on crypto comes ahead of the implementation of the European Union's Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation that promises a licensing frameworks and stringent operating requirements for crypto-service providers in the 27-member bloc.  The 26% rate applies to gains from crypto trading if they exceed 2,000 euros per tax period. As an incentive for declaring crypto profits, the new bill also sets a ""substitute income tax"" for investors at 14% of the value of the assets held as of Jan. 1, 2023, instead of the cost at the time of purchase.  According to the new rules, losses from crypto investments can be deducted from profits and be carried forward.  Investors, however, may require some additional guidance on what qualifies as a taxable event as the document also says, ""the exchange between crypto assets having same characteristics and functions,"" doesn't constitute a ""fiscal case.""

42421411,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXo3UD,1672414230,The Impact of Avraham Eisenberg’s Case on the Future of Crypto,"On Tuesday, federal authorities announced the arrest of Avraham Eisenberg, a crypto trader who conducted what he characterized as a “highly profitable trading strategy” that drained $110 million from Mango Markets, a decentralized crypto exchange. While the complaint details Eisenberg’s activities, none of it will come as a surprise given that the entire operation publicly played out on the blockchain (and in real-time on Twitter). Days after the action, Eisenberg even tweeted he was responsible and would be returning a large portion of the funds.  While Eisenberg’s arrest is likely to raise questions around the application of commodities manipulation and fraud laws to crypto, the more important issue raised by this case involves the work of individuals to uncover weaknesses in decentralized protocols, and the impact and utility of these operations for the future of crypto.  Gareth Rhodes, a managing director at Pacific Street, formerly served as deputy superintendent and special counsel at the NYS Department of Financial Services.  Mango Markets is a crypto trading platform where users can buy, sell, lend and borrow crypto tokens. While Coinbase and Binance are centralized and operate like exchanges in traditional finance, Mango and other decentralized finance (DeFi) exchanges such as Uniswap and Aave are fully decentralized. All transactions are conducted on the blockchain, transparent to all. Rules regarding margin requirements, liquidation triggers and the setting of token prices are established by code that is posted on GitHub, and the marketplace operates without human intervention or oversight.  Mango used oracles to set the price of tokens on its exchange (which monitors the average price the same token is listed for on other exchanges) and allows a user to borrow crypto tokens worth approximately 90% of their collateral. Eisenberg took advantage of these features by accumulating a large amount of Mango’s own token, MNGO, then spending millions of dollars in illiquid markets to drive up that token's price more than 1,300%. He then borrowed $110 million in USDC stablecoins against his temporarily inflated MNGO collateral. Over the course of a few hours, MNGO’s price surged, then collapsed and Eisenberg had $110 million in cash, while Mango’s code-driven liquidation engine automatically sold the MNGO tokens for a far smaller value than what Eisenberg “borrowed.”  Eisenberg’s operation was not exactly a surprise, as the risks of such attacks on decentralized collateralized lending are well known and Eisenberg did not invent this strategy. Sam Bankman-Fried, the ex-CEO of FTX, even tweeted his own prescient observations of the danger of using an illiquid token such as MNGO as collateral. Weeks later, the SEC cited these tweets as evidence that SBF “knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that by not mitigating for the impact of large and illiquid tokens posted as collateral by Alameda, FTX was engaging in precisely the same conduct, and creating the same risk, that he was warning against” with Mango.  Eisenberg’s actions were only possible because of DeFi’s foundational principle: code is law. This means computer code, not human beings, must be the decision makers. The Mango community watched Eisenberg’s operation in real time and could do little to stop it. Eisenberg tweeted he was simply “using the protocol as designed, even if the development team did not fully anticipate all the consequences of setting parameters the way they are.”  Eisenberg is far from the only person who has spent countless hours reviewing a crypto protocol’s code and structure and attempting to attack its weaknesses. These individuals, depending on their perceived and stated intentions, are often met with derision for exploiting these flaws for illicit gain and celebration for pointing out shortcomings that can be fixed and improve protocol resilience. And while no user wants to lose money, if you are a crypto entity seeking to test the resilience of your protocol, your best option is probably to hope an enterprising hacker will take a deep look and attempt an exploit and return the money. Most prominent audit firms decline to work with crypto clients and while some have suggested government regulation will fix these issues, the SEC examined Bernie Madoff’s firm five times without uncovering the fraudulent scheme.  See also: In Praise of White-Hat Hackers, but Overreliance Is Foolish | Opinion  Many observers, and perhaps a jury, will say Eisenberg is a criminal and thief. And the fact pattern – all visible on the blockchain, detailed by Eisenberg’s own self-congratulatory tweets and described in SDNY’s criminal complaint – indicates he did indeed violate the letter of the law that prohibits market manipulation. However, it’s easy to imagine a scenario where without Eisenberg’s operation, the Mango protocol grows much larger and attracts more retail users, and it is North Korea, not Eisenberg, that exploits the protocol to drain user funds to pay for nuclear weapon development, not just a “highly profitable trading strategy.” In fact, as a result of Eisenberg’s successful Mango operation, other decentralized trading platforms implemented new risk mitigation measures, and when Eisenberg went after Aave a few weeks later, he failed.  What’s clear is that the crypto ecosystem will continue to rely on the ability of enterprising blockchain sleuths to find weaknesses in the system. What’s not clear is what framework makes sense to properly incentivize the time and skill required for such activity and protect user funds from being taken. ImmuneFi has a promising model of offering a bounty to hackers who pledge not to take user funds, similar to how the False Claims Act and various whistleblower statutes incentivize individuals to find wrongdoing in return for financial reward.  See also: Calling a Hack an Exploit Minimizes Human Error | Opinion  But it can be hard for a hacker to know a protocol weakness is real without an attempted exploit, and there is no indication these so-called “white-hat hackers” are immune from market manipulation laws, which they may violate even if user funds are fully returned.  Some critics may use Eisenberg’s arrest as the latest example of why crypto is little more than a speculative arena full of scammers. While such arguments may find receptive audiences in developed nations with robust traditional financial systems, look no further than how crypto is being used in everyday life by millions in Brazil, Turkey and Mexico, where residents face political stability, major currency devaluation and decimation of savings on a yearly basis. Or to crypto’s rapid expansion in the Middle East, where authoritarian regimes use the banking system to enforce social control.  Decentralized finance is poised to play an increasingly important role in the crypto ecosystem after the high profile failures of centralized entities and FTX and Celsius. Until a better model is found to pressure test these decentralized protocols, operations such as the one conducted by Eisenberg with Mango will remain a painful part of the journey to making the industry more resilient.

Then, after customers check their balances, withdrawals will be made available as of mid-February, according to the post.  The company said the timeline could change, however, “depending on the progress of the external security audit.”  Withdrawals from FTX Japan were halted on Nov. 8 after local financial regulators ordered the exchange to suspend services. Sam Bankman-Fried's global enterprise, FTX Trading Ltd., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the U.S. three days later.

42417086,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcRpOrF,1672409769,Why DAOs Need to Adopt a 2-Treasury System,"The rapid growth of the Web3 ecosystem has been driven by advancements in Ethereum scaling systems and the emergence of high-performance layer 1 blockchains. This has led to increased adoption of crypto technologies across the board – from internet startups to large enterprise companies.  However, the current model of Web3 ecosystem building has some inherent flaws.  Arjun Krishan Kalsy is the head of ecosystem at Mantle. This article is part of CoinDesk’s Crypto 2023.  Blockchain infrastructure companies are trying to solve two complex and expensive problems simultaneously: building the best-in-class infrastructure and building the largest and most dynamic ecosystem. Each of these efforts require specialized teams and significant spending of resources in order to be successful.  As a result, many blockchain infrastructure companies have seen their treasury funds depleted quickly. For example, the float for Polygon’s MATIC token is over 90% (all vesting included) and the float for Solana’s SOL token is over 85% (all vesting included). This means that most of the tokens from the ecosystem funds of major infrastructure projects have already been expended into the market.  This type of growth strategy, where an infrastructure company has to solve two different problems simultaneously, is not sustainable. This will eventually put a strain on the treasury funds of these projects and blunt the growth and adoption of Web3 technology as a whole.  Specialized layers – a different approach to building Web3  The optimal solution is to turn the one-treasury problem into a two-treasury solution, each with a focus on infrastructure or ecosystem building. By separating the responsibilities of building the best-in-class infrastructure and supporting ecosystem development, each treasury can focus on its specific goals and allocate resources accordingly. This can lead to more efficient and effective use of resources and a more robust and dynamic ecosystem.  Using a two-treasury system, the base layer would focus on building the necessary technical infrastructure such as the blockchain, bridging tools and other tooling. Meanwhile, the ecosystem layer will focus on supporting builders and entrepreneurs that are building Web3 businesses, applications and protocols.  Through the use of dual staking, it is possible to create value for both the infrastructure and business layers. The infra token would accrue value through staking and providing crypto-economic security, while the ecosystem layer token would accrue value through driving the economy of the ecosystem. In addition, the ecosystem layer would generate gas fees, which would transfer value to the infrastructure layer.  Read more: 2023: The Year DAOs Follow the Law?  This is analogous to how Web2 infrastructure companies like Amazon Web Services act as the base layer while companies build businesses on top of its infrastructure to create value for the end user. Overall, this approach offers the potential for creating tremendous value for both the parties involved.  Decentralized organizations  DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) have several unique advantages when it comes to ecosystem building. A DAO is a decentralized network of participants governed by a set of rules encoded in a smart contract. This structure allows for a more open and inclusive decision-making process, as every token holder has a say in the direction of the DAO and can actively contribute to growing the ecosystem.  However, the decentralized nature of DAOs may not always be the best fit for making complex technology decisions. These decisions often require a high degree of expertise and can benefit from the focused efforts of a small, centralized team. Additionally, the presence of information asymmetry can prevent the general public from making optimal decisions in these cases.  Read more: How Bad Tax Policy Drives DAOs Out of the US  By combining the horizontal structure of a DAO with the vertical structure of an infrastructure provider to create a larger ecosystem, increased value is generated for the community. This hybrid approach allows us to take advantage of the benefits of both horizontal and vertical structures for ecosystem building and technology decision-making.  In the past two years, the Web3 space has grown by leaps and bounds but we are still far behind when it comes to mass adoption. The total number of on-chain Web3 participants globally is still in the single-digit millions.  If we are to achieve mass adoption of Web3 technology, we will need to find new ways to optimize the resource allocation towards building both technology and ecosystem.",NEUTRAL,MATIC,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MATIC | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Arjun Krishan Kalsy,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/12/30/why-daos-need-to-adopt-a-2-treasury-system,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dd77c3e49a16442b62b0313e18cf95f24aff6ec1-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to the interview, more than 150 projects are granted support by the company. Pesok also mentioned that LG is rolling out its new television technology that is integrated with its native NFT marketplace where new users can buy digital collectibles. The TVs would also allow users to display the NFTs that they own.

However, recent events in crypto space might slow down the growth of interest in NFTs. Not to mention that the sector is not free from scams and frauds. Just this month, Logan Paul, a major influencer on YouTube, was investigated by Coffeezilla for defrauding his fans on his abandoned crypto project CryptoZoo. Despite these very negative developments for crypto and NFTs as a whole, we can expect a healthy adoption of digital art as LG continues to leverage this new technology. Chart: TradingView Dark Horizons? The crypto industry has taken a heavy beating courtesy of the collapse of FTX and the NFT space has been struggling ever since interest on digital items waned. But with LG’s partnership with Hedera, we might see a brighter tomorrow for NFTs and the crypto market as a whole. However, this “bright future” doesn’t come without losses. According to CoinGecko, Hedera’s native token HBAR has seen better days with the token dropping 5.6% in the past 24 hours. The charts are also very bearish for the token. HBAR is heavily correlated with Ethereum. This means that if ETH continues to buckle under the bearish pressure, HBAR will follow the decline in value.

The firm bought more than 158,000 shares for its ARK Fintech Innovation ETF. Coinbase's stock closed at $34.78 in New York Thursday, up roughly 7%. The shares have fallen 86% this year.  The Bahamian Securities Commission has taken custody of FTX deposits valued at more than $3.5 billion as of Nov. 12. Shortly after FTX filed for bankruptcy, about $372 million worth of tokens were stolen from the exchange by an unknown actor thought to be an external hacker. Given media reports of a cyberattack on FTX, and possible looting of FTX-controlled wallets by former employees, the Commission said in a statement that it ""determined that there was a significant risk of imminent dissipation as to the digital assets under the custody or control of [FTX] to the prejudice of its customers and creditors.""  Solana’s native token SOL largely bounced back from Thursday’s 15% fall after Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin tweeted support for the blockchain battered by FTX’s implosion. SOL rebounded from Thursday’s low of $8.19 to retake the $9.50 range where it had been trading for much of the day. But the token is still 96% below its all-time high of nearly $260, in part because of sellers dumping the “Sam coin” alleged FTX fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried once loudly boosted.

That seizure of assets occurred a day after the cryptocurrency exchange filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in the U.S. The commission made the decision based on information that Sam Bankman-Fried, its co-founder and former CEO, provided concerning cyberattacks that took place on the systems at FTX Digital Markets, the company's registered name in the Bahamas. The commission had obtained the assets under a court order and transferred them to ""secure digital wallets under the exclusive control of the commission,"" it said. The digital assets are being held on a temporary basis until The Bahamas Supreme Court directs the commission to transfer them to FTX customers and creditor or to the joint provisional liquidators. The commission also said it didn't ""direct, authorize or suggest to FTXDM the prioritization of withdrawals for Bahamian clients. ""Such transactions may be characterized as voidable preferences under the insolvency regime and consequently result in clawing back funds from Bahamian customers,"" it said. When the commission sought guidance from the Supreme Court on whether it could provide information regarding the digital assets under its control can be provided to U.S. debtor representatives, the court told the commission that it may only provide provide assistance to domestic or regulatory authorities. The joint provisional liquidators, however, may cooperate with and provide information to the U.S. debtors ""by sharing with their representatives, in a highly confidential manner, certain information respecting the digital assets,"" the court said. The Bahamian Securities Commission is also continuing its investigation into the causes of FTX's failure, following the Supreme Court of The Bahamas' direction, collaborate with other authorities, and take further actions to preserve FTXDM assets, it said. The BSC investigation is separate from the U.S. Department of Justice's probe into an alleged cybercrime that transferred at least $372M out of FTX in that hours after the company had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, Bloomberg reported earlier this week.

6700625,https://newsbtc.com/?p=514228,1672401606,These Are The Bitcoin Predictions For 2023 By Arcane Research,"Historically, 2022 could end up being the second-worst year for Bitcoin since 2011. At the current price, BTC has a year-to-date (YTD) performance of -65%, topped only by 2018 when the price lost -73% in one year. As Arcane Research notes in its year-end report for 2022, physical gold (-1% YTD) has significantly outperformed digital gold, Bitcoin, in a period of high inflation. As a result, the analytics firm notes that the digital gold narrative was premature. As Arcane Research notes, the crypto winter was essentially fueled by tightening macroeconomic conditions and crypto-specific leverage and miserable risk management by core market participants. BTC had followed the U.S. equity markets due to its high correlation. “Apart from two distinct events in 2022, BTC followed U.S. equities very closely. The two outliers of June (3AC, Celsius etc.) and November (FTX), are responsible for the entire underperformance of BTC vs. the U.S. equities,” the report states, displaying the following chart. Bitcoin Predictions For 2023 For the coming year 2023, Arcane Research expects that contagion effects will “probably” continue in early 2023. “[B]ut we view it as likely that the majority of 2023 will be less frantic and borderline uneventful compared to the last three years,” Arcane Research predicts. Related Reading: Solana Prediction For 2023: SOL Is Not Dead Yet, Analyst Says With that in mind, the firm expects Bitcoin to trade in a “mostly flat range” in 2023, but to finish the year with a higher price than it did at the start. Bitcoin’s current drawdowns closely resemble the bear market patterns of previous cycles, Arcane Research elicits. While the 2018 bear market lasted 364 days from peak to end, the 2014-15 bear market lasted 407 days. The current cycle is on its 376th day. This puts the ongoing bear market exactly between the duration in both previous cycles. “If a new bottom is reached in 2023, this will be the longest-lasting BTC drawdown ever,” the firm said and further elaborated that there are quite a few potential catalysts for a renowned bull market: The FTX proceedings may incentivize more rapid progress with regulations, and we view both positive signals related to U.S. spot BTC ETF launches and more coherent classifications of tokens as a plausible outcome by the end of the year, with exchange tokens being particularly exposed for potential security classifications. Regarding Grayscale’s Bitcoin spot ETF application, February 3 will be an important date for the industry when the three-judge panel will rule on the SEC complaint. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Could End The Year Further Lower, Key Resistance Intact In addition, Arcane Research expects another catalyst from Europe: namely, the passage of the MiCA Act by the European Parliament in February 2023. The core prediction for 2023 remains that Bitcoin will recover despite the tightening macroeconomic situation and that now is “an excellent area to build gradual BTC exposure.” However, the start of 2023 could be bumpy as trading volumes and volatility decline in a much duller market than in the past three years. In summary, Arcane Research therefore estimates: As we advance into the next year, patience and long-term positioning will be key. At press time, the BTC price traded at $16,497, facing further downward pressure, probably due to tax harvesting by year-end.

DOGE could continue to move down towards the $0.0620 support zone. DOGE gained pace and traded below the $0.072 support against the US dollar. The price is trading below the $0.0700 zone and the 100 simple moving average (4-hours). There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.0698 on the 4-hours chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could dive further towards the $0.062 support in the near term. Dogecoin Price Signals Bearish In the past few days, dogecoin saw a steady decline from the $0.080 resistance zone. DOGE reacted to the downside below the $0.0750 and $0.0720 support levels. The decline gained pace below the $0.072 level and the 100 simple moving average (4-hours). More importantly, there was a clear move below the $0.070 support zone, opening the doors for a major decline. The price is now trading well below the $0.0700 zone and the 100 simple moving average (4-hours). Doge price traded as low as $0.0667 and is currently showing a lot of bearish signs, similar bitcoin and ethereum. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $0.0695 level. The first major resistance is near the $0.0700 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.0698 on the 4-hours chart of the DOGE/USD pair. The trend line is near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.0795 swing high to $0.0667 low. A clear move above the trend line might send the price towards the $0.073 resistance. It is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.0795 swing high to $0.0667 low. Source: DOGEUSD on TradingView.com Any more gains might send the price towards the $0.0765 level and the 100 SMA. The main hurdle seems to be forming near the $0.080 zone. A clear move above the $0.080 resistance could open the gates for a rally towards the $0.100 level. More Losses in DOGE? If DOGE price fails to gain pace above the $0.070 level, it could continue to move down. An initial support on the downside is near the $0.0665 level. The next major support is near the $0.062 level. If there is a downside break below the $0.0620 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might decline towards the $0.060 level. Technical Indicators 4-Hours MACD – The MACD for DOGE/USD is now gaining momentum in the bearish zone. 4-Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for DOGE/USD is now in the oversold zone.

6693901,https://newsbtc.com/?p=514217,1672392637,"Solana Prediction For 2023: SOL Is Not Dead Yet, Analyst Says","Solana is undoubtedly one of the biggest losers of 2022. With a price drop of 96.2% from its all-time high, investors had to cope with a harsh price correction. One of the main reasons for the crash can be seen in the insolvency of FTX. Since Sam Bankman-Fried’s investment firm Alameda Research still has a considerable stack of SOL in its portfolio, the situation is unlikely to improve, at least in the short term. New CEO John Ray will inevitably have to liquidate this position in order to pay out customers who have been harmed. In the wake of these negative developments, SOL’s price slipped to $9.13 at press time. But Chris Burniske, partner at Placeholder VC, shared some reasons why Solana is far from dead. As the former head of ARK Invest Crypto explained, he was recently asked by Vitalik Buterin what he likes about Solana. Burniske replied that for him, Solana has a “unique flavor of hardcore devotees & nerds,” meaning that they will drive innovation apart from Ethereum: Some of the devotees are hardware junkies, others are network optimization nerds, the validator community is crazy committed, and generally, a layer deeper than the financial opportunists are builders that get truly excited by Anatoly Yakovenko’s [co-founder of Solana Labs] vision. Related Reading: Bitcoin Now Under Realized Price For 163 Days, Here’s How This Compares Historically According to Burniske, Yakovenko himself is also one of the reasons he believes in Solana. “He is admittedly more pragmatic than Vitalik,” the analyst said, further explaining that this approach is guided by the goal of making the “blockchain accessible to billions of people.” In terms of the developer ecosystem, Burniske asserts that it provides a perfect mix of crypto backend experts and Web2 front-end developers – “crypto needs more of them.” At the same time, the analyst notes that the Solana ecosystem isn’t just made up of die-hard crypto devotees, so it’s harder in a bear market “when some of the web2 people lose their nerve.” As for the technology, Burniske is also very optimistic, saying SVM is more powerful than EVM. “While it has competitors, I anticipate Solana will be *the* blockchain ecosystem known for consensus near the speed of light and that will attract builders that prioritize speed w/ sufficient decentralization,” the analyst concluded. Solana Price Prediction For 2023 The start of 2023 is likely to be a slow one for the Solana price due to selling pressure from John Ray. However, once investors rebuild confidence, the $10.94 level should become key. Then, the level at $11.93 becomes interesting, as the 1-day chart shows. However, a first recovery rally is likely to falter. If a breakout occurs, the six-week resistance at $14.90 will come into focus and could be of key importance in determining whether SOL has the potential for larger price gains. If so, the area between $18.31 and $19.94 could provide the next resistance. Once again, investors are likely to want to take more profits here. If SOL also succeeds in breaking through this zone in 2023, a retest of the $25.87 mark would be possible, an area that served as extremely important support back in June. Here, however, a significant price drop towards the south is also to be expected. Related Reading: Solana Suffers Double-Digit Losses, Is There An End In Sight? If and when Solana will be able to reach the resistance at $38.78 again in the year is currently questionable. Only if the bulls return to the crypto market as a result of a Fed pivot with investors developing deep confidence in Solana again, this price level should also be able to fall.

Shortly after FTX filed for bankruptcy, about $372 million worth of tokens were stolen from the exchange by an unknown actor thought to be an external hacker. Given media reports of a cyberattack on FTX, and possible looting of FTX-controlled wallets by former employees, the Commission said in its statement it ""determined that there was a significant risk of imminent dissipation as to the digital assets under the custody or control of [FTX] to the prejudice of its customers and creditors.""  Assets will be held until the Bahamas Supreme Court directs the Commission to deliver them to the customers and creditors who own them, the statement says.

In the statement, the Commission reiterated that it didn't direct FTX to prioritize the withdrawals of Bahamas-based customers.

42410869,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggsCgo,1672376957,"Despite the Frost of Crypto Winter, The Wrapture Holders Kept Their Cool","It's been a tough year to be a non-fungible token (NFT) holder. While 2021 welcomed high-value NFT sales, soaring cryptocurrency prices and an influx of new entrants into the space, this past year has seen trading slow and crypto prices drown in the sludge of an extended crypto winter.  Ethereum, which powers many popular NFT projects, was trading at around $4,000 just a year ago. Now, it's down to about $1,195. The global crypto market cap, once valued at about $3 trillion, currently stands at around $796 billion.  Given the deteriorating conditions over the last year, one would be safe to assume that many NFT holders would be eager to offload their assets and cut their losses. This would have been especially true for holders of generative artist Dmitri Cherniak's The Wrapture NFT project, a collection of 50 algorithmic art pieces made available to holders of his Eternal Pump collection that launched in December 2021.  Part social experiment, part community building exercise, holders of the project were given a set of rules that would ultimately determine their NFT's rarity and long-term value: If no one moved, listed or sold their asset for a year, the project would be capped at 50 editions and they would be free to move their art without consequence. But if one collector were to ""break the rules,"" the remainder of the 666 editions would be released to the public for minting.  ""Scarcity typically adds value to art,"" prominent collector Vincent Van Dough, who owns eight Wrapture NFTs, told me.  ""I was hoping they would [wait],"" Cherniak said. ""I always rooted for it to hold."" The artist also stored one of The Wrapture NFTs in his vault, meaning that he could have technically broken the rules at any point, leaving other collectors to face the repercussions.  Collector Ayybee, who holds The Wrapture #40, recalled the turmoil of needing to rely on other holders' goodwill. ""It's sort of this form of the prisoner's dilemma,"" they told me, ""except we could communicate and coordinate."" They said they considered ""all of the various possibilities as time passed"" when deciding whether to wait an entire year to derive any monetary value from their digital asset. ""One year is a millennium in this space,"" they said, adding that ""much of the intrigue as it relates to this project was being a participant in the process and so naturally, you want to see that through to the end.""  Others were motivated to hold onto their NFTs as an unspoken commitment to the community of holders that emerged from the project. ""The social experiment aspect of the project is something that I think really resonated and was an important statement for the space,"" said Pete Molick, who owns The Wrapture #37.  ""The Wrapture/Eternal Pump Holder group has become very close over the course of the last year,"" said Matt Miller, owner of The Wrapture #24. ""It would not only would it be unfair to my fellow collectors participating in this experiment, but it would also be a poor financial decision to flood the collection supply with 616 more outputs.""  ""There was a faction of people from the outside clamoring for a knight in shining armor to break the Wrapture and allow more people to collect, but ultimately it was never even a question to hold on,"" he added.  A commentary on flipping culture  In early 2021, Cherniak was riding a high after the release of two successful NFT projects on the generative art platform Art Blocks – Ringers, a 1,000-edition, algorithmically generated project based on strings and pegs, and Eternal Pump, a 50-edition hand-coded animated project that nods to the culture of ""pumping"" up the price of an NFT project. Cherniak's work, along with the work of other artists like Art Blocks founder and Squiggles artist Erick ""Snowfro"" Calderon, Fidenza artist Tyler Hobbs and more, helped to revive the art style known as generative art.  ""When Ringers was released in January, it helped kicked off a new wave of appreciation for generative art,"" Cherniak told me. ""And because of that, it also became highly valued and sought after."" He added that the soon-after-released Eternal Pump added to ""the mania and insanity around a drop and the intense botting"" that resulted in automated systems buying and selling artwork for massive profits.  By the summer and fall of 2021, the Canadian-born, New York-based artist said that generative art had ""reached a new level of attention, partially due to the dollars being thrown at it."" His third Art Blocks release, The Wrapture, was meant to be a ""conclusion to a trilogy of projects.""  ""It was originally supposed to be an exploration and combination of the visual forms from my first two drops, but became more of a conceptual project and my response to my experience in the previous year,"" he explained.  Anyone that held an Eternal Pump NFT was invited to mint a Wrapture NFT, resulting in a tight-knit community of 37 NFT owners that held the project's future in their hands.  ""In many ways, the Wrapture became a mirror to the NFT ecosystem,"" he said, ""And it was my attempt to make a point that art, and crypto art, does not need to be flipped or sold for short-term capital gains.""  Challenges in 2022  The 37 holders had to abide by one simple rule to increase the scarcity (and, presumably, value) of their NFTs: Hold on for dear life, often colloquially abbreviated to HODL.  ""It was a unique opportunity to be a part of the art, so to speak,"" said Ayybee.  This may have been an easy task in 2021 when the crypto market was booming and NFTs often yielded great returns. But the mood of 2022 gradually became less optimistic – high-profile rug pull scams tainted the NFT space, wash trading obscured trading data and the collapse of crypto ecosystem Terra, crypto lender Celsius and most recently Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX resulted in volatility that rippled throughout the crypto space. Spooked traders left in droves.  In particular, the liquidation of Singapore-based crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital almost derailed The Wrapture's plan entirely. The fund had suffered major losses from deteriorating crypto conditions and was ordered to liquidate its assets in June and filed for bankruptcy in July. Three Arrows Capital had purchased dozens of high-value collectibles – including four Wrapture NFTs – through its Starry Night Capital fund, and it was unclear what would happen to those assets as the company caved in.  ""There was definitely a sense of collectively holding our breath not knowing exactly how that liquidation would be handled,"" said Molick.  In October, liquidators began moving Starry Night Capital's multi-million dollar NFT collection into a Gnosis Safe, which requires multiple signatures to approve a transaction. Hundreds of NFTs were transferred in the process – except for the four Wraptures, which remained untouched until the project's lock period ended earlier this month.  ""We were all amazed that every NFT they owned was transferred to the liquidators with the exception of the Wraptures,"" said Miller.  ""Liquidators opted not to move the Wraptures until it was over, which means not only were they aware of the rules of the game, they decided to actively engage in the game,"" added Cherniak.  A bright spot in an otherwise dark year  Over 365 days, none of the 37 Wrapture holders listed, moved or sold their NFTs. The experiment ended on December 17, capping the collection at 50 pieces and leaving holders with a sense of camaraderie and accomplishment.  Wrapture #7 was auctioned off by Cherniak on December 21, with 100% of proceeds to fund gastroesophageal cancer research at Princess Margaret Hospital in Toronto. The winning bid of 169 ETH (about $203,000) was made by crypto art fund Curated.  Several Wrapture NFTs have been transferred between wallets over the last week, though none have sold yet. At the time of writing, only one Wrapture was up for sale at 175 ETH (about $209,530), making the floor price of the project 175 ETH. The highest bid for a Wrapture NFT so far is 20 wrapped ether (wETH).  So what to make of this yearlong social experiment? Holders shared their thoughts.  ""Can’t say I’m too surprised by the outcome,"" said Vincent Van Dough. ""Art Blocks and especially Eternal Pump went on a huge run last year before The Wrapture mint, so by that point, the only people left holding were long-term collectors who didn’t seem to have a need to take profits.""  Others were moved by a sense of unity and market optimism.  ""I think it shows that there is a true community of passionate collectors that are unwavering despite market conditions,"" said Miller.  ""Undoubtedly it says that generative art is here to stay and that there is continuous growth that isn't necessarily tied to what's happening in the markets,"" added Ayybee.  For Cherniak, the experience was a testament to the creative use cases for blockchain technology.  ""Ultimately, blockchains are social coordination technologies,"" he said. ""I think if anything, they just highlighted that NFTs and crypto don’t always need to be about the money.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Rosie Perper,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2022/12/30/despite-the-frost-of-crypto-winter-the-wrapture-holders-kept-their-cool,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/18362991af0a9d1c84b9c8ac2872d5bf053a9e48-1440x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The firm bought more than 158,000 shares for its ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF). While the firm has added smaller amounts of the stock in recent days, on Dec. 14 it about purchased a total of almost 300,000 shares at a closing-price cost of about $12 million. Those were allocated mainly to the ARK Innovation Exchange-Traded Fund (ARKK).  Coinbase's stock closed at $34.78 in New York Thursday, up roughly 7%. The shares have fallen 86% this year.  The stock has underperformed both bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH). Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is down 65% this year, and ether has dropped by 66%.

BTC remains at a risk of more downsides below the $16,000 support zone before the year end. Bitcoin is showing bearish signs below the $17,000 and $17,200 resistance levels.

There was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance near $16,610 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could resume its decline if it stays below the $17,000 resistance zone. Bitcoin Price Faces Resistance Bitcoin price gained pace below the $16,800 support zone. BTC even extended its decline below the $16,700 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. The price traded as low as $16,453 and is currently correcting losses. There was a move above the $16,500 and $16,550 levels. The price climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $16,960 swing high to $16,453 low.

If bitcoin fails to start a recovery wave above the $16,700 resistance, it could start another decline. An immediate support on the downside is near the $16,450 level or the recent low. The next major support is near the $16,250 level. A clear move below the $16,250 support might spark a move towards the $16,000 level. Any more losses might send the price towards $15,500.

With this collaboration, Blueberry is developed to provide incentives and network fees. LINK price down 0.85% Partnership with Blueberry bolsters buyer confidence Crypto experts expect LINK to go bullish before the year ends According to data by Coingecko, LINK price has plunged by 7.5% in the last seven days, and trading at $5.55 as of this writing. Technical indicators demonstrate that the coin has lost its grip at the $6 level, which could hint at a bearish signal. If the bulls fail to shoot over $6, it could be a bigger challenge for Chainlink. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breaking Past This Key Barrier Could Spell 10% Spike For DOGE LINK Bulls Push To Get Price Past $6 On the brighter side, the LINK bulls are always quick to make a comeback whenever the price crashes. When prices dip below critical level, buyers immediately move to save the day. In this scenario, a breach of the $6 level would be a big achievement, especially in ushering the new year. But, LINK is expected to shoot up higher. Michaël Van De Poppe, a crypto expert, expects LINK to move into the bullish territory by 2023. In detail, he expects the crypto to hit $17 if the bulls reach a resistance level of $7.80. On the other hand, the crypto analyst says that Chainlink can drop and warm up below $5 before it pumps up in price. Chart: TradingView As of press time, LINK has been consolidating between $6 and $8. Considering this, any breach below this range could pull LINK further down. Predictably, bulls will take over once the digital asset breaches this low range.

The bear pressure mounts each time the crypto drops, as it is expected to slide further below the consolidation range. Whale interest has increased for Chainlink. In fact, LINK is said to be one of the top 10 most purchased crypto in the past 24 hours. This is surprising because LINK did not accumulate any major gains over the past week, but investor and buyer confidence did. Understandably, the whales were excited with LINK because the technical indicators suggested a price rally in the coming days or before the year ends.

SOL rebounded from Thursday’s low of $8.19 and retook the $9.50 range where it had been trading for much of the day. But the token is still 96% below all-time highs near $260, in part because of sellers dumping the “Sam coin” alleged fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried once loudly boosted.  “Some smart people tell me there is an earnest smart developer community in Solana, and now that the awful opportunistic money people have been washed out, the chain has a bright future,” Buterin tweeted shortly before SOL’s Thursday recovery began.  SOL has lost 20% in just one week. It is trading in the single digits for the first time since February 2021.  “Hard for me to tell from outside, but I hope the community gets its fair chance to thrive,” he said of Solana’s developers, who are building a decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem to rival Ethereum – the DeFi market leader.  Some on Crypto Twitter are pointing out that SOL’s 2021-2022 chart mimics the boom-bust pattern set by ETH in 2018 and 2019, when ETH fell 95% from its heights above $1,200. ETH weathered another boom-bust cycle and has settled in the $1,200 range again.  For SOL to recover it will likely have to shake off its association with Bankman-Fried, who invested heavily in SOL and supported Solana projects with FTX venture deals and market-making from Alameda Research. The twin companies’ implosions triggered an exodus of capital from Solana DeFi; and its trading protocols continue to suffer from insufficient liquidity.

The coin has fallen by 1.8% over the last 24 hours. The coin has lost over 4.7% of its market value in the past week. Algorand had been consolidating on its chart over the last few weeks, but the consistent lateral trading has pushed the bulls out of the market. The technical outlook has sided with the bears, with no clear indication of the price turning around in the coming trading sessions. Ever since ALGO lost the $0.28 price level, the coin has been unable to stop its downtrend. The aforementioned price floor acted as a crucial level for the altcoin. The Algorand price has also remained unaffected by positive changes in major market movers’ prices. Since the altcoin was rangebound for a while, buyers lost interest and rushed to sell the altcoin. Algorand has lost over 30% in the month of December itself. At the time of writing, the ALGO price is 96% below its all-time high from 2021. The market capitalization of Algorand has witnessed a considerable decline, indicating that sellers have completely taken over the market. Related Reading: Dogecoin Has To Remain Above These Levels For Price To Turn Around Algorand Price Analysis: One-Day Chart ALGO was auctioned for $0.166 at press time. The immediate resistance for the altcoin was at $0.172. The coin has attempted to test the overhead price ceiling, but the bearish strength has taken over the market. Since demand for Algorand has fallen substantially, the altcoin can fall to $0.163 before the price reverses itself. This could present traders with a shorting opportunity. Two crucial resistance levels were at $0.177 and then at $0.181. Moving above the $0.181 mark will help the coin target the $0.20 price. On the flip side, a fall from the present price level will bring the Algorand price to the $0.15 zone. The amount of ALGO traded in the last session was red, indicating a high selling volume at the time of writing. Technical Analysis The altcoin has depicted a death cross at the end of November, which is an extremely bearish signal. A death cross occurs when the long-term moving average moves above the short-term moving average. In the case of the Algorand price, the 50-Simple Moving Average (SMA) had crossed over the 20-SMA line. Ever since the death cross, ALGO has been under the grasp of sellers. The Relative Strength Index stood on the 30-line, a sign of the asset being oversold and undervalued. Similarly, the Algorand price was below the 20-SMA line as sellers continued to drive the price momentum in the market. Although all indicators pointed toward bearish strength, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator displayed green signal bars. MACD indicates price momentum and reversals; the green signal bar was tied to buy signals. This could mean buyers can re-enter the market now as ALGO could reverse its price. However, it is completely uncertain if ALGO will recover soon. The Parabolic SAR suggests the price direction. The indicator formed dotted lines above the candlesticks, which meant a continued downtrend for the asset.

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Bitcoin Remains Defiant at the Close of a Dreadful Year  By James Rubin  On the third to last day of a historically, massively, tragically bad year, bitcoin held its head proudly if barely above water.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading just above $16,630, up a few fractions of a percentage point over the past 24 hours. BTC has now been balancing roughly between $16,400 and $17,000 for 13 days amid investor sluggishness typical for a year's closing days. Crypto markets would also rather forget acquaintances – auld and new – to 2022 even as they gird for more rough times ahead in 2023.  ""Bitcoin continues to happily tread water and watch the storm pass as it fluctuates in a range of around $16,000-$17,000,"" wrote Craig Erlam, senior markets editor for foreign exchange market maker Oanda, in an email. ""That's broadly been the case over the last couple of weeks and it doesn't look like changing in the coming days, barring any unexpected headlines.""  Erlam added: ""The question for many now is whether it has bottomed and how long it will take confidence to return, enabling a strong recovery. I'm not convinced by either in the near term and think there are plenty more twists and turns to come early next year.""  Ether was recently changing hands slightly below $1,200 but up 0.8% from Wednesday, same time. Other major cryptos were mixed with ETC, the token of the Ethereum Classic blockchain project, rising about 4% and popular meme coin SHIB up nearly 3%, but SOL's sad saga continuing, with the token of the embattled Solana blockchain, plummeting more than 12% at one point. SOL erased those losses after Ethereum co-founder Vitalik tweeted his support for the platform, but has dropped almost 20% over the past week from over $12 to nearly $9.70, and is off more than 90% since Jan. 1. SOL's decline has largely stemmed from Solana's ties to the collapses of the Terra ecosystem and crypto exchange FTX.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, recently jumped 0.21%.  Equity indexes closed 2022's penultimate trading day on a high with the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 climbing 2.6% and 1.7%, respectively. The S&P notched its biggest gains in a month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) rose 1%. Investors remain wary about China's retreat from Covid lockdown, which could jolt its stagnant economic growth but also raise global, energy prices.  Security remains a key issue for the crypto industry. In an interview with CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program on Thursday, Ari Redbord, head of legal and government affairs at crypto sleuthing firm TRM Labs, said that cracking down on crypto hacks will require hardening cyber defenses. The former U.S. Justice Department prosecutor said that finding strategies to identify and trace illicit activity will mean developing better “blockchain intelligence tools” that can identify new mixers before bad actors can get to them.  According to TRM Labs, more than $3.6 billion in funds have been drained in crypto this year. About 80%, or roughly $3 billion, targeted decentralized finance (DeFi)  Earlier in the program, CoinDesk Indices Managing Director Andrew Baehr, said that although bitcoin's value declined about 64% year-to-date, CoinDesk research showed that BTC and ETH returns in 2022 per unit of risk were about the same as equities and significantly better than bonds.  ““We want to underscore this is not too different from what you would see in traditional markets, especially stock markets,"" Baehr said. ""Look at some of the darlings that people were really excited about 18 months ago in stocks, they’ve lost 80-90% of their value as well.”  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Shiba Inu SHIB +2.9% Currency Cosmos ATOM +2.8% Smart Contract Platform Solana SOL +2.6% Smart Contract Platform  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Gala GALA −2.9% Entertainment Decentraland MANA −2.8% Entertainment Avalanche AVAX −2.1% Smart Contract Platform  Insights  Fund Manager 3iQ Has 3 Bold Predictions for 2023  By James Rubin  A year ago, before the crumbling of the Terra ecosystem, the implosion of Three Arrows Capital and crypto lending platform Celsius and disgrace of exchange giant FTX, who could have foreseen that the digital asset industry would be limping home in 2022. A year ago, bitcoin was still percolating over $47,000 and seemed likely to remain unruffled by the economic headwinds already buffeting the world.  What's in store in 2023?  In an interview with CoinDesk, Mark Connors, head of research for Canadian crypto asset manager, said he expects a price rebound in 2023 and TradFi companies and others to play a more active role not only in finding uses for blockchain technology but in the development of regulation. ""Leadership will come from the corporate side, not the regulatory side,"" Connors said.  CoinDesk: What's your first prediction for 2023?  Connors: Leadership will come from the corporate side, not the regulatory side. We're looking for regulatory clarity so that investment firms can own coins and invest in existing Layer 1s. Whether whether it be bitcoin, Ethereum or Layer 1s, we believe the incentive structures of companies will make them take a leadership role and act and not wait for legislation to both continue to create their own industry blockchains as well as leverage the existing Ethereum EVM, and to a lesser degree, the bitcoin blockchain as they transfer both B2B and B2C functionality to blockchains. That was the most silent, underreported action in 2022. TradFi is going to lead the charge, not native crypto and not regulatory agencies. That's going to be the curveball.  CoinDesk: What else do you foresee for the year ahead?  Connors: 2023 will be a barbell for digital assets. It will be the core Layer 1s, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and it will be the use of NFTs by TradFi companies, which is a corollary to my first point. In 2022, the ecosystem was you had your alt level ones like Solana, Algorand and the like providing the bulk of the non-Bitcoin, Etherium, stablecoin market cap. Seventy percent of market cap in digital assets of the last 12 months. So that 30% of market cap is going to shift from alt level ones and level twos and other projects to be more NFT related. The NFT technology from a security and verification standpoint has greater integrity, and a higher trust and security factor. Given it can be nested with the Etherium ecosystem and can be bridged, it will have functionality and security. I think you'll see the most growth in NFTs.  CoinDesk: What's going to happen to crypto prices? Do you see a rebound, and if so, when?  Connors: We are so dollar based. Dollar strength destroys risk assets. The Fed has two mandates, price stability and full employment. But they have taken on a third mandate. They have a trilemma, which is wonderful because no economic system can run on two poles. My third prediction is that before the third quarter, the Fed will stop quantitative tightening. They will stop because the Treasury market would have experienced a failure like September 2019. Money markets will crack, the Fed will print and crypto will reverse as sharply as it did in March 2020. We're still young as a market. We don't conrol our own destiny on price and adoption.
