42377310,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70Iyx,1402004108,IRS: No Bitcoin Reporting Required for FinCEN Foreign Banking Tax Form,"The US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) declared during a 4th June webinar that US taxpayers are not required to report bitcoin on Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) Form 114, a document also known as the Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Account (FBAR), for this year’s tax season.  According to Bloomberg Bureau of National Affairs (BNA), a senior IRS program analyst remarked that taxpayers face no reporting requirements when filling out their Form 114 for 2014. Taxpayers that hold more than $10,000 in a foreign bank are required to a file this form with FinCEN.  The move is the latest guidance offered to US taxpayers on the subject of bitcoin, coming months after the government agency ruled that bitcoin would be taxed as a property rather than a currency.  The analyst, Rod Lundquist, announced the policy guidance when asked about bitcoin during the webinar, saying:  ""At this time, FinCEN has said Bitcoin is not reportable on the FBAR, at least for this filing season.""  The IRS official went on to acknowledge that this policy is subject to change as the IRS clarifies its policies on digital currencies. He added that the agency continues to review its policies regarding bitcoin and that the FBAR guidance in particular may be adjusted in the future.

42377320,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70JAH,1402002111,Maturing Middle Eastern Bitcoin Ecosystem Emerges at ArabNet Conference,"The past year and a half has seen the slow but steady march of bitcoin across the financial landscape, gaining market share and investor interest with each passing month. Yet, in the Middle East, digital currency remains a fringe prospect in the eyes of the region’s financial players.  A small group of startups and entrepreneurs are hoping to change this mindset with a new array of bitcoin platforms and tools that could deliver much-needed financial resources to an area where only 20% of the population has access to banking services. Before this can happen, however, cultural and technological challenges must be overcome.  Tarik Kaddoumi, co-founder of bitcoin retail payments service Umbrellab, told CoinDesk that he sees bitcoin's success in the region arising from the financial barriers that currently exist, saying:  ""Bitcoin will play a vital role in the Middle East mainly due to the very low credit card penetration in the region, and the difficulty of acquiring a credit card or sometimes even a bank account.""  Kaddoumi recently spoke at the ArabNet Digital Summit 2014 in Dubai, where he was joined by David El Achkar, founder of bitcoin payments provider Yellow. The panel, entitled ""The State of Bitcoin"", was reportedly warmly received and has set the stage for future bitcoin developments in the region.  In conversations with CoinDesk, the two entrepreneurs agreed that the soil is fertile in the Middle East for bitcoin to rise to prominence.  ArabNet Digital Summit  El Achkar told CoinDesk that many participants expressed great interest in bitcoin at ArabNet. He noted that roughly half of the crowd was familiar with digital currencies, and that the bitcoin panel received a large number of questions both during the discussion and afterward.  On the other hand, he suggested that members of the tech community are still researching bitcoin and haven't made up their minds about the technology, a fact that was on display at ArabNet:  ""The tech and broader community in the Middle East is definitely still in the early learning phase about bitcoin. For example, I generally ask, at every event I participate in, 'Who understands bitcoin?' I’ve found the average to be at around 20%.""  Kaddoumi added that bitcoin remains in its ""infancy"" in the Middle East, and that more outreach is needed before conference attendees in the tech world – and the broader public – embrace digital currencies.  The path to bitcoin adoption  Both Kaddoumi and El Achkar are focused on the payments ecosystem in the Middle East, and both told CoinDesk that this area of finance represents one of the possible gateways for bitcoin adoption in the region.  Notably, most e-commerce transactions are cash-on-delivery (COD), meaning that consumers pay for goods upon receipt. According to El Achkar, this payment method accounts for roughly 80% of e-commerce sales in the Middle East:  ""This greatly increases the cost and complexity of online purchases, not to mention it can regularly take three weeks for a merchant to receive payment. If that isn't bad enough, a customer is far more likely to return a product unpaid for when it is ordered COD. Clearly, there is a lot of room for improvement in payments.""  Kaddoumi sees this as a reflection of the region’s large underbanked or unbanked population. Unable to access credit or banking services, most rely on cash as a means of payment. Bitcoin, he said, presents an ""immediate solution"" that enables merchants in the Middle East to gain access to revenue faster than traditional methods.  Opportunity for fintech startups  According to El Achkar, the Middle East is a challenging environment for fintech companies. He said that operational costs keep startups at bay, a problem that is exacerbated by the fragmented nature of the region’s market.  Digital currency, he continued, could make the environment more amenable for fintech startups, saying:  ""The regulatory environment is not supportive enough of small business. Bitcoin can potentially address [these] issues by lowering the cost and complexity of innovation as well as eliminating the borders.""  El Achkar cautioned that, by and large, the tech community in the Middle East is still wary of bitcoin. Calling them ""fairly skeptical on average"", he nonetheless declared that businesses in the ecosystem are actively exploring bitcoin. The question remains whether or not tech companies in the Middle East embrace the digital currency.  El Achkar explained:  ""People will often point to the many ways in which the region lags behind technologically (eg: Internet penetration, credit card penetration), and say it simply is not the right time for bitcoin.""  Bitcoin in Islamic banking  Banks worldwide have begun to look at bitcoin and the possible integration of its underlying technology. While no bank in the Middle East has expressed openness in this regard, Kaddoumi sees bitcoin fitting into the broader institution of Islamic banking, which presents several key differences from Western-style banking.  Islamic banking  is founded on key principles established in the Qur’an, most notably the abolishment of charging and receiving interest on loans. Additionally, investments made by Islamic banks must meet certain ethical and moral thresholds, with an emphasis on sound risk assessment and societal benefit.  Kaddoumi said:  ""As bitcoin resembles a commodity with finite existence, transparency that promotes ethical use and the general similarities to precious metals as a commodity, there are a lot of reasons to believe that it will take a very comfortable seat in islamic banking, even more so that fiat currency.""  Kaddoumi said that Umbrellab is conducting a study to see exactly how bitcoin fits into this system, consulting with legal and Islamic banking experts.  Education key to bitcoin's future  For Kaddoumi and El Achkar, as well as other bitcoin entrepreneurs in the Middle East, education and outreach remain top priorities. This includes appearances at events like ArabDigital, building contacts at other tech startups and reaching out to the region’s merchants and consumers.  From a technological standpoint, this process also means educating the populace about bitcoin tools like wallets and exchanges. Kaddoumi remarked that ""lack of knowledge and skepticism are still the two main factors standing in the way of increased adoption"".  Additionally, El Achkar suggested that cultural distrust surrounding online payments could be assuaged with the broad integration if bitcoin, saying:  ""There remains a lack of trust in online payments on average in the region leading to low credit card usage and a small (but growing) e-commerce sector. This, I believe, can be turned around with proper education as bitcoin addresses many of the concerns raised against conventional online payment options.""  Bitcoin, it seems, may come to play a prominent role in the Middle East, but only time will tell if long-standing cultural barriers and a lack of technological integration keeps digital currency from becoming more deeply rooted in the region.

42377312,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70J2j,1401998486,CAVIRTEX Cuts Fees by 50% in Bid to Boost Customer Morale,"Calgary-based digital currency exchange CAVIRTEX took to reddit today in a bid to solicit community feedback about its policies and performance, and announce that its CEO, Joseph David, would soon partake in an upcoming Ask Me Anything conversation on the site.  Most notably, representative Kyle Kemper indicated that the company is cutting trading fees by half to 0.75%, and updating its account activity fee policy so that users now receive three alerts before new changes are made.  Kemper also sought to bolster the narrative surrounding the company, which has garnered criticism for mishandling the implementation of past policies, being slow to respond to customer concerns and for not providing investors with promised dividends from company revenue.  Nonetheless, Kemper was optimistic heading into the discussion with the community, placing a firm emphasis on how CAVIRTEX is looking to put its troubles behind it:  ""We’ve got a solid roadmap ahead of us, but in the past we’ve made mistakes. It is my goal to change this and fix our reputation amongst one of the most impressive communities on the planet and have your support moving forward.""  Kemper also defended the company's inactivity fees, which charge users $50 a month for keeping bitcoin in the exchange after more than 12 months of inactivity.  The representative added: ""The message that the dormant activity fee tries to get across is that we are an exchange and not a bank/wallet. As part of your long-term bitcoin plan you shouldn't use an exchange to store your coins.""  Customer refunds  Though Keeper wrote enthusiastically about his company's need for such fees, he did acknowledge that CAVIRTEX did not communicate the policy change effectively and that this caused understandable frustration within the community.  Kemper wrote:  ""The way we implemented this was terrible, and we apologize. We didn't communicate it properly, we didn't include proper alerting, and we didn't test the system properly.""  Kemper continued by telling reddit that the company has since refunded select users, and stating that those who feel as though they were improperly charged can submit a complaint ticket to address their concerns.  Vibrant debate  Community reaction to the post ranged from warm to hostile, with users reporting varied experiences with and reactions to the company.  For example, some chose to take aim at CAVIRTEX for the lack of dividends they say were promised to investors, while others, though upset regarding past issues, were willing to provide the exchange with feedback and recommendations about how it could improve.  Support and communication were two of the most often cited areas where users said improvement was needed, though others took aim that the company's current website.  CAVIRTEX hinted that updates to the site are forthcoming, and that a French version of the site is also in the works.  Company at crossroads  Despite its mixed reputation, CAVIRTEX has been one of the more successful crowdfunded bitcoin companies to emerge from a digital currency IPO, raising its initial funding on Havelock Investments and launching in March 2013. Along with competitor Vault of Satoshi, it is one of the more well-known exchanges serving the key North American market.  CAVIRTEX has also been among the more visible members in Canada's bitcoin ecosystem, speaking before the Canadian Senate earlier this year alongside bitcoin ATM manufacturer BitAccess and advisory services firm Bitcoin Strategy Group.

42377313,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70J1T,1401991218,US Government Bans Researcher for Supercomputer Bitcoin Mining,"A National Science Foundation (NSF) researcher has been barred from working with the US government following the discovery that he used federally funded supercomputers to mine bitcoin without authorization.  The administrative action was revealed as part of the latest NSF Office of Inspector General (OIG) report issued to Congress and recently posted online.  The unnamed researcher is alleged to have used more than $150,000 in NSF-supported computer activity to generate an estimated $8,000 to $10,000 in BTC.  The researcher asserted that he was simply conducting tests on the supercomputers, but both of his affiliated universities denied that they had authorized such actions.  Further, the report asserts that investigations lead to evidence that the individual had taken steps to hide the mining efforts, stating:  ""The researcher accessed the computer systems remotely and may have taken steps to conceal his activities, including accessing one supercomputer through a mirror site in Europe.""  The report summary concluded by indicating that the NSF has been suspended from providing any further work to any US government body.  Unanswered questions  The NSF OIG report suggested that the abuse was uncovered by the agency after it received reports about the unauthorized activity.  However, no further details about how these discoveries were made were provided.  The report also gave a basic overview of bitcoin, noting that it is a ""virtual currency that is independent of national currencies"", and that it can be converted into real currencies using certain exchanges.  Increasing incidents  The announcement, while notable, is not the first time that a researcher has been reprimanded for using cutting-edge computers without permission to mine digital currencies.  This February  a Harvard researcher was barred from accessing any of the university's research computing facilities after he was caught mining dogecoin.  University computers have also become a magnet for students looking to generate digital currencies using advanced equipment and the free power universities provide. For example, in late April, Iowa State University indicated that its computer security systems were compromised by students attempting to mine bitcoin.

42377304,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70Isf,1401985486,$100k Peter Thiel Fellowship Awarded to Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin,"PayPal co-founder and noted VC investor Peter Thiel announced the latest class of Thiel Fellows today, with Ethereum co-creator and Bitcoin Magazine co-founder Vitalik Buterin being named as one of the new set.  The 20-year-old Toronto native, along with 19 other fellows, will receive $100,000 over the next two years to use toward current and future projects.  Noting that today's innovators face more challenges than ever given current global economic issues, Thiel stressed the need for his programme while expressing optimism about what this year's class could achieve:  ""We hope the 2014 Thiel Fellows inspire people of all ages as they demonstrate that intellectual curiosity, grit and determination are more important than credentials for improving civilization.""  To make the class, Buterin beat a lengthy field of applicants that included representatives from 44 countries and every US state. Applicants of all ages also sought entrance to the programme, with candidates coming from high school and college competing against those with no formal higher education or only some higher education like Buterin.  Community spokesman  Despite his youth, Buterin has already built an impressive resume in the budding digital currency industry. For example, Buterin has been involved in several notable projects outside of his initial editorial endeavour, Bitcoin Magazine, including Dark Wallet, KryptoKit and Ethereum.  Buterin is also a regular on the bitcoin conference scene, having unveiled the second-generation digital currency platform Ethereum at the North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami this January.  More recently, Buterin spoke at the Texas Bitcoin Conference in March and at Global Bitcoin Summit, the controversial Beijing-based gathering held this May.  Ethereum and beyond  Buterin has more recently, however, become involved with what may be Bitcoin 2.0's most notable project to date, Ethereum. Styled as a decentralized mining network and software development platform, the project has sought to further expand the applications of bitcoin's underlying technology into the field of smart contracts and decentralized applications.  CoinDesk reached out to Buterin to determine how he will use the fellowship funds and whether they will be used to bolster Ethereum as it looks toward launch. However, at press time, we had received no comment.  For more on why he gravitated to this project and its implications for the digital currency economy, read our most recent interview with Buterin.

42395315,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASaLRd,1401980584,Bitcoin VC Investment This Year Already 30% Higher Than 2013’s Total,"The amount of venture capital raised by bitcoin startups this year has already surpassed the total amount raised in 2013 by more than $27m.  So far in 2014, $113.2m has flowed into bitcoin businesses, which is 29% greater than the total amount for last year, which stands at $88m. In 2012, bitcoin startups raised just $2.1m, according to CoinDesk statistics.  The most active investor so far this year, by number of investments, was 500 Startups, which bought stakes in five companies. The Bitcoin Opportunity Fund, marquee venture capitalist Tim Draper and Crypto Currency Partners also made two investments apiece this year.  The 500 Startups investments were much smaller and earlier stage bets, at about $100,000 each, compared to the seven-figure rounds the other investors participated in.  Venture funds were most attracted to exchange businesses in terms of the number of investments made. Exchanges attracted seven investments worth about $21m in total. Financial services and payment processors were the next most popular investment categories, by number of investments made.  The category that raised the most amount of funding was payment processors, with a total of about $31m raised. Wallet services, mining and exchanges were second with about $21m raised each. Noteworthy was the fact that the mining category comprised just one investment, worth $20m, in BitFury.  Topping the fundraising table so far this year is payment processor BitPay, which raised a record-breaking $30m in May, following a seed round of $2.7m last year.  The round was led by Index Ventures and included Peter Thiel's Founders Fund, Sir Richard Branson and Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang as marquee names. BitPay executive chairman Tony Gallippi told CoinDesk that the new money would be spent on continuing to scale the business.  Perhaps as a sign of the rapidly maturing bitcoin ecosystem, tied for second place on this year's fundraising table this year are two startups operating on opposite ends of the bitcoin economy.  BitFury, with its $20m funding, produces a critical piece of the bitcoin economy's infrastructure: blazingly fast ASIC miners. Xapo, meanwhile, raised an equal amount based on its promise of bringing bitcoin transactions to debit cards and providing more secure wallets.  The five startups that raised the most funds this year accounted for $97m of total venture capital invested, or 84% of the total.  Bitcoin may be a global, decentralised digital currency, but the United States remains the clear favourite for startups operating in the bitcoin ecosystem.  Some $172m of all venture funding for bitcoin companies tracked by CoinDesk so far has gone to companies headquartered in the US – a 75% share of the funding pie. That trend hasn't changed in 2014, with US-based companies raising $78m in total so far – 68% of all venture capital investment in the space.  It's clear from the data that bitcoin startups are gaining traction among venture investors. As financial and human capital continues to pour into the digital currency space, bitcoin bulls will continue to find reasons to cheer.  However, it's also worth putting bitcoin investment activity into context. The total amount of venture funds raised for financial services firms last year was some $566m, according to the National Venture Capital Association in the US. Bitcoin still has a long way to go.  Along with many others in the investment space, Rui Ma from 500 Startups and Index Ventures' Jan Hammer will be appearing at CoinSummit London this July.

42377306,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70IvB,1401977505,eBay CEO: PayPal Will Have to Integrate Digital Currencies,"John Donahoe, CEO of online e-commerce marketplace eBay and its subsidiary PayPal, has once again hinted strongly that he sees the integration of bitcoin into his companies' offerings as inevitable.  His new statements suggest that bitcoin may be more than simply on eBay's ""radar screen"" as he has previously suggested, and follow his May declaration at a shareholders' meeting that the company is ""actively considering"" integrating bitcoin into its online payment gateway, PayPal.  In a new interview with CNBC, Donahoe reiterated that he expects bitcoin to play a role in the company's future plans, stating:  ""I think there's no doubt digital currency is going to play an important role going forward, and at PayPal, we're going to have to integrate digital currencies into our wallet.""  Although Donahoe did not provide a timeline as to when the company's users can expect such functionality, he did speculate on several ways bitcoin could come to play a key role in facilitating commerce on eBay and PayPal:  ""I think you'll see bitcoin used in different use cases, whether it's a peer-to-peer use case, a cross-border transaction – someone's sending currency to someone else, and over time, you'll start to see it with some merchants accepting bitcoin.""  The CEO also indicated that he personally owns bitcoin, and that he is more interested in understanding the technology behind bitcoin than using it as an investment.  Empowering small businesses    In the interview, Donahoe also addressed an ongoing issue with rival Amazon, which has recently found itself embroiled in a battle with a major book publisher.      While the comments were unrelated to bitcoin, his response does provide a insight into why eBay may be looking to embrace digital currency at a time when other major tech players such as Amazon and Apple are holding the innovative technology at bay.      Donahoe told CNBC:      ""What ebay represents is opportunity for small sellers. [...] eBay, from its very beginning, took entrepreneurs, took small businesses, and now also some large businesses, can give them an equal playing field to reach 140 million buyers around the world.""              As more small merchants begin to associate strongly with bitcoin, it's possible that eBay will see increased demand for the addition of such offerings.    eBay's slow bitcoin build    Although eBay has not formally embraced digital currencies – as other online e-commerce players like Overstock and TigerDirect have done, the company nonetheless has allowed the technology to be used on its website, if only in particular use cases.      For example, eBay's classifieds listings sections in the US and UK now display virtual currency categories where consumers can facilitate peer-to-peer digital currency buying and selling.      That move was encouraged by site users, many of whom had previously sought to exchange such assets via eBay's global platform, but reported that postings were removed for conflicting with the company's policies at the time.

42377314,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70J5F,1401964109,Fidor Exec: Banks Can't Avoid Competition from Cryptocurrencies,"Michael Maier is the COO of Fidor Bank, which is based in Munich, Germany, and is the banking partner of San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange Kraken.  With its refreshingly open attitude towards digital currency technology, the bank recently decided to use the Ripple Labs open payment protocol to allow customers to move money.  Maier was recently in San Francisco speaking at a cryptocurrency event hosted by Merriman Capital, where CoinDesk spoke with him about regulation, Ripple and the banks' competition from cryptocurrencies.    CoinDesk: What is your sense of the digital currency market in Europe?  Michael Maier: In Germany, it happens to be that bitcoins are regulated. The German authorities [classify] bitcoin as a so-called 'accounting unit', and therefore there is a kind of regulatory framework that a bank can rely on. That makes it a little more easy for us to work with bitcoins. It was important for the authorities to take a stand on that.  Bitcoin and therefore Ripple has built up a payment scheme – a payment protocol – which enables you to do so with a lack of time, fast settlement and, of course, within some regulatory environment, because Ripple is implementing its trusted gateways.  The good thing on that is that, as a member of the Ripple protocol, one can choose whom to trust, and this is very important from an AML [anti-money laundering] perspective. That made it much more easier for us at Fidor Bank, having this kind of regulatory clarification.  We are a small innovative bank, and therefore we try to set up innovative things as well.  Why did you choose Ripple as opposed to another digital currency?  It’s not regarding the virtual currency. Ripple is much more, because you’re not only able to send virtual currencies, you are able to send fiat currencies as well. That makes it interesting for us, because basically from a bank, usually, you send euros, US dollars, Swiss francs, whatever.  We see it like a payment scheme or payment channel that you can use to make payments faster and easier and more directly. Maybe even much more efficient for the customer.  Is the plan for Fidor to have Ripple gateways?  Yes. The first stage of cooperation will be that we will implement Ripple for our German customers.  But, you might be aware that we are already touching base in Russia, with a partner there, and opening up a Fidor Bank there.  Let’s see if the traditional payment channels [in Russia] are worthwhile. This could definitely be an option, connecting Fidor Russia with Fidor Germany. You have on two sides, two trusted gateways.  What’s Ripple’s role in this?  Two kinds of relationships. The first relationship is that we are implementing the Ripple protocol payment channel for our customers.  If I have a banking customer and he wants to send money out, why not use Ripple? If he knows a beneficiary with a Ripple wallet, why not use that? On the other hand, we [will] maybe try to connect these gateways within the Fidor family.  We are also looking for other gateways in the US, [or] wherever, where these trust relationships can be built upon [and] both sides can send and accept money transfers.  Is the goal to help save customers money or speed up transactions? What makes Ripple a better proposition?  It’s not that we don’t like the existing systems. We are very customer-centric, and the customer should get the payment channel he wants to have.  It’s not that Ripple is superior, but we think that it will have a future and that our customers will choose Ripple for certain use cases. In other use cases, they will use (in Europe) SEPA. Other use cases, cash-to-cash transfers.  This is our policy: be open and cooperate with everything else. It’s not that one is superior [to] the other, the customer has to decide what’s best.  So you are giving them the option. Are they going to know that Ripple is an option?  Yes. It will be [branded]. Within the account, you can see all the different payment channels. So if somebody says I want Ripple for whatever reason, he gets Ripple.  What level of fees will you charge for this service?  We want to make a reasonable offer to our customers. We will position Ripple as a very reasonable option.  When would you allow customers to hold bitcoin?  This is a very difficult question because then you have to store the bitcoins. A very small and young bank doesn’t want to be the first bank who stores bitcoins and gets attacked from all hackers all over the world. That is why we aren’t brave enough.  There’s no standard for storage of bitcoins yet. What is the right standardization on that you can offer? That’s not our core business, as a bank.  As a banker, what do you think about bitcoin exchanges and wallets? Because basically what they are doing is they are becoming financial institutions for cryptocurrency.  You are absolutely right. The lack of regulatory clarity is exactly what all the authorities have to think of. Because if this is widespread, the question is if you can forbid it. Or do you want to regulate? I have a personal opinion on that: it is always better to regulate than to forbid.  Then, an exchange might be a financial institution. With all the constraints that they have and rules to follow. [But] this will create trust, for the customers of the exchanges and the financial institutions.  As a banker, how do you feel about that? These companies are coming out of nowhere. If they aren’t regulated out of existence, they will be competing against you.  Can I avoid it? So what I have to do is accept it and cooperate. That’s what we are doing. That’s the Fidor way.  I think a lot of bankers are already realizing what is happening out there.  I’m pretty sure there will be a lot of digital customers out there that want to have a different kind of financial services in the future. [But] bank accounts are the last mile. Finance has had a hold on that, and will continue to leverage it.
