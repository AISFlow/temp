42425773,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIg5Jh,1402614621,Restaurant's Stolen Consumer Data Now For Sale on Bitcoin Black Market,"A recent data breach that struck noted Chinese restaurant chain PF Chang's resulted in the loss of sensitive customer financial information, including credit card numbers. Now, some of the numbers are on sale, with one site accepting bitcoin as payment for the stolen card information.  Founded in 1993, PF Chang's operates more than 200 restaurants in Argentina, Canada, Chile, Mexico, the Middle East and the US, and boasts a casual dining atmosphere and Asian-style cuisine.  Krebs On Security reports that a batch of credit cards purportedly tied to the PF Chang's breach first became available for sale on 9th June. The website, Rescator, has previously been the site for credit card sales stemming from other high-profile data breaches, including the ones that struck retailers Target and Neiman Marcus.  The digital security site said:  ""The shop accepts payment via bitcoin (for hopefully obvious reasons, customers cannot pay for the goods using credit cards).""  Data for sale  The batch of credit cards, dubbed 'Ronald Reagan', boasts a valid number rate of 100%, with payments being available via Western Union, MoneyGram and bitcoin. Krebs reported that the price of each card number ranged from $18 to $140.  The report added that many of the cards may still be functioning, given the fact that the breach was only discovered in the past few weeks, saying:  ""It seems likely that PF Chang's only learned of this breach very recently. The cards sold under the Ronald Reagan base are advertised at '100 percent valid', meaning that fraudsters can expect all of the cards they purchase to have not yet been canceled by the issuing banks.""  Currency of choice  By accepting bitcoin, the illicit seller is no doubt attempting to tap into digital currency’s anonymous transaction capabilities and favorability among black market users. It’s not clear whether any numbers have actually been bought with bitcoin since they became available earlier this week, however, the seller isn’t the first to try and draw in bitcoin purchases on fraudulent goods and services.  In May, digital commerce giant eBay was the victim of a cyberattack that targeted its databases. Shortly after the news came to light, an unidentified person attempted to sell what they claimed were the database’s contents for bitcoin.  At the time, eBay denied that the purported database information was authentic.

42425766,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIg5Bh,1402608396,$18 Million Worth of Silk Road Bitcoin to be Sold By US Government,"UPDATE (12th June 11:30 BST): This article has been updated with new details on how interested bidders can register for the auction.          The US government is preparing to auction off roughly 30,000 bitcoins appropriated from the Silk Road online black market.    The bitcoins, worth approximately $17,898,600 at current market prices, are currently being held in two wallets owned by the US Marshals Service.  The auction will be held on 27th June from 06:00 to 18:00 (EDT), according to a press release published by federal government.  In a statement, the US Marshals Service said:  ""The bitcoins offered in this auction have been ordered forfeited to the United States.""  Placing your bid  As part of the auction, the Silk Road bitcoins will be divided into two phases for eligible bidders.  The US Marshals Service (USMS) has effectively split the 30,000 BTC into nine blocks of 3,000 BTC and 1 block of 2,656.51306529 BTC, known as 'Series A' and 'Series B' blocks, respectively.  All interested buyers must register with the US Marshals Service (USMS) in order to be eligible for the auction. Aspiring participants must provide the following to the federal agency:  A $200,000 deposit sent by wire transfer from a bank located in the US  A copy of a government-issued photo ID  A manually signed PDF copy of the bidder registration form.  All required registration items must be delivered to a government email address (USMSBitcoins@usdoj.gov) by a designated deadline. The USMS will then contact each individual who submits a form by 17:00 on 26th June by approving or denying the submission. Any registration documents received after the deadline will not be considered, the agency says.  The federal agency added:  ""If the USMS determines that you are not an eligible bidder, you will receive communication of that fact from the USMS, the deposit funds will be returned, and you will not be eligible to participate in the online auction.""  The $200,000 deposits sent by the winning bidders will be retained by the USMS and used toward the final purchase price, though the individuals could lose their deposit under certain circumstances.  The auction process  Bids will also need to follow a strict process put forward by the USMS.  The statement reads:  ""In order for your bid to be considered by the USMS, you must send a signed pdf copy of the Bid Form to a separate email address that will be provided to eligible bidders only within the online auction period window, which extends from June 27, 2014 at 6:00 A.M. EDT until 6:00 P.M. EDT. Bids received before or after the online auction period will not be considered. Bids that do not conform to the following instructions will not be considered.""  Those who submit orders for multiple bitcoin blocks could receive any number of blocks up to the maximum total that they wish to acquire. For instance, should a bidder submit a request for six Series A blocks, they could be awarded up to six of these allotments.  The winning bidder will be the individual who offers the highest bid, the USMS says. Should there be a tie, the first bid received will be the prevailing bid.  The US Marshals Service (USMS) said that the 29,657BTC is located in this wallet.  Strict rules for auction  The rules state that the auction bidders will need to pay for their bitcoin via an all-cash wire transfer. The USMS will notify auction winners on 30th June.  There is a deadline of 1st July for winning bidders to pay for the bitcoins. The rules also stipulate that the funds cannot be transferred to a bitcoin address publicly known to be located in a country restricted by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).  Additionally, bidders are being required to certify that they are not acting on the behalf of anyone representing Silk Road or its alleged proprietor, Ross William Ulbricht.  The terms state that the USMS has the right to deny anyone from buying any block of bitcoin, as well as the right to sell only a portion or withdraw the bitcoins from auction at its discretion.  Questions about interested parties  It remains to be seen whether those who have previously expressed interest in the Silk Road bitcoins will submit a bid during the USMS auction.  In February, it was reported that the investment firm Falcon Global Capital contacted the US government regarding buying seized Silk Road bitcoins. At the time, co-founder Brett Stapper stated that the firm had acquired financial support to purchase the bitcoins seized from Silk Road.  CoinDesk reached out for comment, but representatives from Falcon Global have not yet replied in regards to this latest development.  The full statement from the federal government reads:    The US Marshals are preparing to auction nearly 30,000 bitcoins in connection with a civil forfeiture and criminal action brought against Ross Ulbricht and the assets of Silk Road in October 2013 in federal court in the Southern District of New York.      The auction will take place during a 12-hour period on June 27 from 6 a.m. until 6 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time. Bids will be accepted by email from registered bidders using a form available from the US Marshals Web page, www.usmarshals.gov/assets/2014/bitcoins.    In order to make a bid in this auction, potential bidders must register between the period of June 16 at 9 a.m. through June 23 at noon EDT and make a refundable deposit of $200,000 via wire transfer from a bank account in the United States. The bitcoins will be auctioned in nine blocks of 3,000 bitcoins and one block of approximately 2,657 bitcoins. The winning bidder(s) will be notified on June 30.    The bitcoins offered in this auction have been ordered forfeited to the United States. In a separate criminal case, Ulbricht has been charged with narcotics trafficking, computer hacking and money laundering offenses in connection with his alleged operation of “Silk Road,” a hidden Web site that was designed to enable its users to buy and sell illegal drugs over the Internet anonymously.    All the bitcoins that were held in an FBI wallet have been transferred to two US Marshals wallets. One wallet is being used for this auction, and the other wallet is being used to hold the remaining approximate 144,342 bitcoins that are part of the civil forfeiture and criminal action brought against Ross Ulbricht and the assets of Silk Road.

42425768,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIg59h,1402600510,Bitcoin Miner Hosting Firm HashPlex Raises $400k in New Funding,"UPDATE (12th June 18:45 BST): This article has been updated with comment from HashPlex investor and SecondMarket CEO Barry Silbert.      Bitcoin miner hosting company HashPlex has completed a $400,000 seed round led by Barry Silbert of SecondMarket and senior Facebook engineer Jason Prado.  Bernie Rihn, co-founder of HashPlex, said the funding would enable his company to complete its 1MW HashCenter in central Washington, east of Wenatchee, and continue developing custom hardware and software.  ""HashPlex needs to move quickly while maintaining a level of great service, and this investment will help us continue to do so,"" he said.  The investors  Silbert, who founded SecondMarket, a US-based online marketplace for buying and selling illiquid assets, is also behind the Bitcoin Opportunity Corp. This investment vehicle has previously funded a number of popular companies within the digital currency space, including BitPay, Circle, Coinbase and itBit.  Regarding his firm's investment, Silbert told CoinDesk he sees the funding as helping to support smaller bitcoin miners, who he feels are being underserved by the investment community.  Silbert said:  ""As digital currency mining has shifted to larger, well-funded 'industrial' mining companies, I was attracted to the idea of giving the little guy the opportunity to participate by hosting their mining equipment at professionally run, low energy cost facilities.""  Stanford University graduate Prado previously worked in software engineering roles at Microsoft and Google before joining Facebook in October 2012. He first met Rihn and HashPlex co-founder George Schnurle at university 10 years ago.  Rihn described having Silbert and Prado on board as investors as being like ""having two seasoned guides"", adding:    ""Both Barry and Jason know bitcoin well from a technical perspective and they know how to keep us well positioned as bitcoin continues to evolve.      Having them on board will be the difference between HashPlex as a flash in the pan and HashPlex as a lasting, trusted brand.""    Prado is also listed on the team section of HashPlex's website as Advisor and Software Chief.  Hosted mining  Seattle-based HashPlex enables people to mine bitcoin without the disadvantages of keeping equipment at home. Customers send the company their digital currency miners and it does the rest, providing host computers, Internet, start/stop/control scripting and basic maintenance.  HashPlex currently offers three tiers of service, the first being 'Alpha', which costs $99/kw-month for a minimum of 1kw and a minimum service agreement of one year. It guarantees monthly up time of at least 95%, offering refunds for anything below this, but states its typical up time is 99.9%.  Armed with these capabilities, Silbert said that he believes the future is bright for HashPlex:  ""By connecting its various facilities, the company has the opportunity to set up a vertically integrated mining pool that, as Mike Hearn recently recommended should be created, could set best practices for how a pool should be run, including such as things as documented block policies, audit-able inclusion and payouts, etc.""  The company currently employs eight people, although Rihn said the new funding will enable it to expand rapidly in order to meet customer demand.

42425771,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIg5Lh,1402596052,Coinbase Now Allows Merchants to Offer 25% Discounts on Bitcoin Purchases,"Coinbase is now offering its merchant partners a way to incentivize bitcoin payments with a new feature that will allow businesses to extend discounts of up to 25% to consumers.  The California-based company framed the move as one that will provide merchants with a dynamic way to incentivize their customers to shift away from traditional payment methods.  As the costs of a credit or debit card transactions fall largely on the merchant - who may find themselves charging more to make up for these expenditures - a discounting feature can make it more enticing for customers to spend bitcoin.  Coinbase  said in a statement:  ""[Transaction] expenses are passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices for goods and services. Bitcoin significantly reduces transaction fees and costs associated with fraud and chargebacks. And now, merchants can share these savings with consumers by enabling instant discounts on orders paid in bitcoin.""  How it works  Setting the discount is designed to be relatively simple for merchants.  Merchants who use Coinbase can opt to apply an automatic discount to purchases by making the change in their Merchant Settings menu.  The discount is reflected in all final prices, with customers being able to see the price reduction as they initiate the payment.  Steady growth for California startup  The discount feature is the latest development in a busy season for the bitcoin startup.  In the past few weeks, Coinbase has announced key payment processing partnerships with major Colorado-based US satellite television provider DISH Network and REEDS Jewelers, a large US-based jewelry and precious stones retailer.  The company has also begun making an effort to boost its public profile, particularly among consumers who may not be overly familiar with digital currencies.  In late May, Coinbase announced that it was embarking on a worldwide bitcoin distribution effort. At the time, the company said the goal is to give $10 worth of bitcoin to more than 20,000 students around the globe.

42425765,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIg57h,1402595113,Tech Education Startup Treehouse Looks to Bitcoin Payments for International Advantage,"Orlando, Florida-based online interactive education specialist Treehouse has announced that it will now accept bitcoin for its subscription web design and web development education services.  Treehouse, which to date has raised $24.6m through six funding rounds, boasts 70,000 students who use the platform to learn valuable skills in languages and software such as Android, CSS, HTML, Java, jQuery, iOS and Ruby, among others.  Treehouse COO and CFO Michael Watson told CoinDesk that while the company has been aware of bitcoin for some time due to its tech-savvy user base, it only recently felt that the digital currency had matured enough to consider it as part of its business strategy.  Watson explained:  ""Before we weren't sure if it made sense, because we're a relatively small company with literally 1,000 things we could be doing to advance our mission. Bitcoin was new, and it was unclear which way it was going to go. But, now that it's been pretty well received – you see bitcoin tickers on Google and Yahoo, we felt that it made a lot of sense.""  With the announcement, Treehouse becomes the latest company to begin accepting payments through California-based merchant processor and consumer wallet specialist Coinbase.  Launched in 2011, Treehouse is one of a growing number of education startups seeking to provide alternatives to university-style education for tech-minded individuals. Notably, Treehouse's past investors include The Social+Capital Partnership, whose team includes bitcoin champion and former CoinSummit speaker Chamath Palihapitiya and PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel.  How Treehouse works  Treehouse incentivizes users by encouraging them to follow tracks and work toward goals that can then be used by students to advance their education or find new employment.  Those who enroll are given a list of courses to work through in a given subject area that may use videos, quizzes and code challenges.  Treehouse offers a Basic monthly package for $25 that features access to more than 1,000 videos, live practice tools and members forums. The Pro package, available for $49 per month, includes the aforementioned tools as well as exclusive workshops and a personalized training curriculum.  Today, Watson says online payment options such as PayPal and traditional credit cards – which can charge 2-3% per transaction – remain the most popular ways for students to pay for services on the site.  International advantage  Watson suggested that while he doesn't know the full impact bitcoin will have on his platform, he believes the digital currency's value proposition for consumers in the developing world is perhaps its most exciting advantage.  Echoing points that were also raised in the company's official blog post, Watson said:  ""Our students abroad who don't have access to credit cards or PayPal because they don't have bank accounts, those students now have another way to pay for Treehouse.""  As the CFO of the company, Watson was also excited about the potential cost savings Treehouse may reap, noting that bitcoin's reduced transaction fees could help it allocate more money to improving its content and teaching services.

42425777,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIg5Ph,1402582137,How Bitcoin Empowers Global Peer-to-Peer Lender BTCJam,"San Francisco-based startup BTCJam is taking peer-to-peer lending to a global audience, and is using bitcoin to achieve its vision.  Bypassing the restrictions of fiat currencies, the company says, allows any individual in the world to receive a loan via its platform.  While traditional wire transfers are costly and not always easy to set up, bitcoin allows approved BTCJam borrowers to receive funds almost instantly, wherever they may live and whether or not they have a bank account.  Celso Pitta, the company's CEO, told CoinDesk:  “We are a global lending platform. We use bitcoin as a payment method to enable international, cross-border lending.”  From banker to bitcoin entrepreneur  Pitta, who hails from Brazil, had prior experience in the finance industry before starting BTCJam:  “I worked for Citibank. Knowing banking from the inside, I knew that I could do better: a peer-to-peer lending website.""  However, Pitta reached his first stumbling block when he discovered the penalty for starting an unlicensed money-lending service in Brazil.  “I noticed that if you do [lending] in Brazil, you will go to jail for 10 years,” he said.  As absurd as that might sound to some, this potential roadblock is what led Pitta to make the decision to conduct the company's business in cryptocurrency, rather than trying to become licenced as a bank, which was cost prohibitive:  “I found bitcoin, and it was perfect. Because now I am global.”  Pitta said that BTCJam has already funded over $5m in loans for people in over 100 different countries.  Investor rewards  In peer-to-peer (P2P) lending, investors team up to provide loans to individuals without going through a traditional financial body such as a bank.  Over the last decade, the concept has taken off as an industry in its own right. Last year, in the US alone, over $3bn was issued by the two largest P2P platforms for fiat currency loans, Lending Club and Prosper.  BTCJam believes that P2P lending is at least a $1tn market globally and, for bitcoin holders who start lending out their funds, the concept is a great value proposition.  Pitta told CoinDesk that BTCJam's marketplace usually has 20 investors per loan, who receive a return of 19% per year on average.  That may seem high, but, like any loan, interest is based on ability to pay a loan back, said Pitta, explaining:  “If your credit score is not good, the loan rates are obviously higher.”  Despite this, access to bitcoin loans at such rates still represents a good deal for many people, Pitta pointed out. In Brazil, for example, some lenders charge 10% per month to borrowers.  Furthermore, he said, distributing bitcoin around the world in this way helps promote the use of digital currency through different exchanges and wallets, even if the borrowers are ambivalent to that fact:  “The borrowers, they don’t really care about bitcoin. They need the money. I think, in the future, we’ll use [bitcoin] on a day-to-day basis. But that’s not really the reality right now.”  Global credit scoring  BTCJam has also solved another problem that has limited many P2P lending sites to specific geographic areas. By building its own proprietary credit-scoring system that uses a type of artificial intelligence called 'machine learning’, the company can rate the reliability of borrowers worldwide.  “It is very common that people don’t have credit scores,"" Pitta explained. ""This makes it difficult to give out loans. Our technology allows us to do instant credit scoring using a handful of data we collect from the user.”  When a user registers on the BTCJam website, a number of verifications can be completed to build up a score. Identity verification is required, of course, but there are also options that build up a reputation profile.  Users can link their social media accounts, prove income, validate a phone number and even upload personal references in order to prove creditworthiness without the use of traditional credit history – something many countries still have no established system for yet.  Pitta said:  “Bitcoin is the ‘pipe’, an implementation that enables us to do this. But the real intellectual property is our credit scoring, our ability to do international credit scoring.”  Bitcoin to fiat offramp  Many companies offering remittance or other financial services in bitcoin often encounter what is known as a 'last mile' problem. The issue is that, although bitcoin is great for quickly moving money around the globe, it is almost impossible to spend for day-to-day purposes.  Although BTCJam has its own bitcoin wallet through which it funds loans, the company understands that borrowers need to exchange the digital currency for cash at their end. So the company arrived at a solution.  “We are now integrating with local exchanges around the world. That will allow customers to convert to fiat once they get a loan,” said Pitta.  For example, in the US, users can already link their BTCJam wallet to Coinbase and easily move funds into a US bank account.  Furthermore, BTCJam has already integrated with exchange in Brazil called Mercado Bitcoin, Pitta said, and partnerships are planned with exchanges in Mexico and China, among others.  CoinDesk prices  While bitcoin has many advantages in its role as the conduit to move value, BTCJam still has to value loans in local currency to make the amounts more accessible to borrowers.  “We allow people to make loans that are attached to the exchange rate in other currencies,” explained Pitta.  At the time a loan is funded, BTCJam uses the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index API, which collects pricing data from a basket of exchanges, to price out the total amount in local currency. So, if the customer is in, say, India, the system will take the exchange price and calculate it in rupees.  “We are pegging the loans to the exchange rate of [fiat] currencies. The CoinDesk BPI is good because, compared to the other APIs around, it’s very reliable in terms of uptime,” said Pitta, adding:  “We’ve tried several [price APIs], and BPI has been good for us.”  Regulatory concerns  BTCJam incubated at the California-based 500 Startups accelerator in 2013, and earlier this year received a $1.2m seed round from a group of investors led by Ribbit Capital.  The fact that it has funded millions of dollars in loans through thousands of transactions is a clear sign that global P2P lending is a viable business. At the same time, however, BTCJam is taking on the role of a financial company and regulatory concerns are never far from the company’s mind as a result.  “We’ve spent a lot of time thinking about [regulation]. We have a law firm working on it, and we want to comply with regulation,” said Pitta.  Even so, Pitta isn't overly concerned about regulation stifling innovation within the digital currency economy, relaying recent comments from a German central banker, indicating that startups like BTCJam have influence on banking policy:  “‘You all hate us’, she told me. ‘But we are behind you by definition. You are the innovators. You do something new. We don’t do anything new. We regulate things.'”  Bitcoin Peer to Peer image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/06/12/how-bitcoin-empowers-global-peer-to-peer-lender-btcjam,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3fb569d15379a6d2b3abdeff482c06dcd22185df-1000x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425749,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIg4nh,1402574449,Latin America's First Ripple Gateway Now Serving Seven Local Markets,"Payment solutions provider AstroPay has launched Ripple LatAm, Latin America's first licensed money service business to use the payment network established by Ripple Labs.  Ripple LatAm will serve consumers and developers in seven markets, including: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru and Uruguay. The service aims to help consumers sending payments across borders, while also allowing developers to build remittance platforms using Ripple's technology.  Andres Bzurovski, founder of Ripple LatAm and recent Bitcoin Foundation board member candidate, told CoinDesk he believes the new initiative will provide a solution to common money transmission issues in the region.  Though he believes the platform will appeal to consumers and developers, Bzurovski expects the company to have the biggest impact on the business-to-business market, stating:  ""Ripple LatAm effectively opens the region for business, allowing for real-time B2B cross-border payments between markets in each partner’s currency of choice. Now, a European-based business can send euros to be received as Brazilian real by a business in Brazil within seconds and at a fraction of the cost.""  The news marks the latest major announcement from online payments specialist AstroPay, a former partner of infamous Japan-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox. AstroPay boasts 600,000 customers and an established infrastructure in what is increasingly being seen as an important region for digital currency expansion.  Leading in Latin America  Founded in 2009 with a focus on online payments, AstroPay has moved quickly to embrace digital currencies and the role they could play in improving the economic abilities of consumers and businesses in Latin America.  The AstroPay founder told CoinDesk that Ripple LatAm is just one of three planned digital currency endeavors in development at the company, though he did not provide further details on future announcements.  Bzurovski said his time at the company is now ""99% dedicated"" to digital currencies. He revealed that he was first introduced to bitcoin by Xapo CEO Wences Casares in early 2013, and his interest has grown steadily since.  Bzurovski recalls:  ""For me it was a life-changing experience. Coming from the online world and the payments background, I saw the future of payments, particularly because of the situation in Latin America. With the volatility of currencies, erratic economic and financial policies and corrupt politicians, it made a lot of sense.""  Ripple's advantage  While introduced to digital currency through bitcoin, Bzurovski indicated that Ripple's solution may be more uniquely tailored to the needs of the Latin American market.  For example, because Ripple uses a digital currency to move fiat currencies, Bzurovski suggests that the company's offering is easier for local regulators to comprehend:  ""I think that first of all, for policymakers, it's much more easier to understand because we are talking about a communications system and not an entirely different currency.""  Bzurovski cited current laws in Uruguay that mandate licenses for e-money and e-wallet services as a prime example. He says that while such laws don't allow for the use of new currencies in these offerings, the Ripple network (itself not a 'currency') can present a legal alternative.  Localized solutions  Bzurovski also explained that Ripple allows AstroPay to alter its services for the needs of each of the markets it serves. This is an important factor, as he notes ""a Brazilian solution is not 100% portable to Argentina or Mexico"".  However, despite this extra maneuvering, Bzurovski believes there are compelling use cases for the technology, ones that can be underscored by examples of how the current money transmission system is failing local economies.  Bzurovski, for instance, noted that consumers who deposit checks in Argentina must pay a 0.6% tax of the face value of the check. The tax, he says, creates the incentive for all the stakeholders along a supply chain to simply endorse a check and use it to pay for a service rather than depositing it.  ""Let's say that I own a supermarket and I buy a lot of meat. I buy the meat from the slaughterhouse and I issue you a check for the meat that I am purchasing. If you deposit the check, you will have to pay that 0.6% – so they take it, endorse it, and pay for the cattle owner. The cattle owner endorses and pays for the grain for the cows will be fed, so everyone tries to avoid depositing the check.""  He concludes: ""This can be solved without all the hassle through Ripple.""  Ripple expands  The launch also marks Ripple's latest expansion into developing economies following the May launch of Mexico's first Ripple gateway.

42395317,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASaLTb,1402565951,Bitcoin ATM Startup BitAccess Joins Y Combinator's Trailblazing Incubator,"California-based startup accelerator Y Combinator has officially selected bitcoin ATM manufacturer BitAccess for admittance to its esteemed incubator program.  Founded in 2005, Y Combinator has gained a reputation for empowering entrepreneurs and startups, with nine of its companies having since been acquired by Google and seven snapped up by Facebook – a track record that attracted BitAccess to the deal.  Haseeb Awan  , co-founder of the startup, indicated that while his firm has shied away from major investments in the past, the Y Combinator offer – which finds the incubator investing $120,000 for a 7% equity share in the startup – was appealing for the additional incentives it can provide.  Awan told CoinDesk:  ""If we're going to take it to the next level, we're going to need those kinds of connections and partners who can help us to grow to a billion dollar company.""  Y Combinator has been active in the bitcoin space before, backing notable bitcoin startups such as consumer wallet and merchant processing specialist Coinbase and white-label bitcoin exchange provider Buttercoin.  Accepting BitAccess wasn't an immediate decision for Y Combinator, according to partner Justin Kan. However, he said his opinion shifted after a face-to-face meeting with the founders:  ""Honestly, I was skeptical when I first heard the idea, but we invested in BitAccess because the founders impressed us during YC interviews. Without any experience with ATMs, they had created three generations of functional machines and had them live in the world with their own software, all in under five months. That is impressive.""  The investment, Awan said, marks the first official funding announcement for the company. BitAccess was co-founded by Awan, Moe Adham, Ryan Wallace and Vignesh Sundaresan.  Invaluable support  Awan indicated that a key part of the investment's appeal is the new relationships that Y Combinator can help the company foster, and that the money, while beneficial, is secondary to the overall benefits of the program:  ""Yesterday, we met with the founder of Stripe. Next week, we are meeting with the founder of PayPal. Once we meet with these people, we will learn how to grow the company and how to get into financial platforms.""  Such partnerships, he suggests, will prove invaluable as the company seeks more investment, larger partnerships and entrance into new markets.  International ambitions  Though often pegged as a Canada-based company, Awan stressed that BitAccess is turning its focus to international markets, particularly in the US and Europe, explaining that ""Canada is too small of a market"".  Awan noted that the company opened a possibly temporary new Silicon Valley office on 2nd June, but that it aims to maintain a presence in California in the long term, in accordance with its wider market goals.  Driving Canada's conversation  BitAccess has emerged as one of the better-known Canadian bitcoin startups in the international community, even among what has become a crowded sector of the bitcoin economy in the country.  Following the launch of the world's first bitcoin ATM in Vancouver, Canada has become a hotbed for bitcoin ATM activity, with even large exchanges such as CAVIRTEX looking to enter the field.  BitAccess has also been visible outside the bitcoin community as well, speaking earlier this year to Canadian regulators from the Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce as the country strives to refine its regulatory approach.

42425758,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIg4xh,1402531313,Blockchain Exec Joins Largest Chinese Exchange OKCoin,"Changpeng Zhao, Blockchain's former Head of Development, has left the company after a few months to become Chief Technical Officer at China's largest bitcoin exchange, OKCoin.  Zhao said that, while many might be surprised at his move, for him it was a simple decision:    ""OKCoin is already the best bitcoin exchange in China, if not in the world. We plan to make OKCoin truly international. OKCoin has the best technology platform, safest security measures, and above all the best team.      We also have highest volume and liquidity, the fastest deposit and withdraw processing, and the best customer service. Our customer service is available 24x7, and most inquiries are resolved within minutes.""    He added the coming year would see OKCoin launch in additional markets around the world, supporting more currencies, and providing better service to users in the international community.  Blockchain role  It might have been a short time, but Zhao's period at Blockchain covered much of that company's stellar transformation from a one-man labour of love in early 2013, to a team of four by the end of 2013, and on to the large distributed multinational and world's most popular bitcoin storage service it has now become.  As Head of Development, Zhao oversaw the company's promotion in the Asian region, as well as product development for its API and acquisition of information service ZeroBlock, as well as other operations, including infrastructure and security.  Prior to entering the bitcoin world, Zhao was the co-founder of Fusion Systems, and Global Head of IT at Bloomberg Tradebook Futures.  The road to bitcoin  The multilingual Zhao first got into bitcoin on the recommendation of Ron Cao, Managing Director of Lightspeed Venture Partners and a personal friend, after he had invested $5m in OKCoin's competitor BTC China last August.  BTC China's CEO Bobby Lee, another friend, also advised him to convert 10% of his net worth into bitcoins.  Zhao then proceeded to study in every way he could, by reading Satoshi's White Paper, combing the bitcointalk forums, attending a few conferences, and trying out bitcoin for himself.  With the bitcoin price rising steadily before he'd bought a single satoshi, he quit his job and began looking for full time work in the bitcoin sphere. This in turn led to Roger Ver and Blockchain, which he joined last January.  Belief in China  Despite recent tribulations, the future for bitcoin exchanges in China is still bright, he said, and his move to OKCoin reflects the sort of personal confidence he maintains in the industry:  ""OKCoin is a young, energetic and truly professional company with tons of potential. I am confident OKCoin is, or will become, one of the iconic companies in the bitcoin space, globally. And I want to be part of that process and contribute to it. There is strong alignment. The decision basically came down to future potential of the company.""  Amicable departure  Zhao said his departure from Blockchain was an amicable one, and that he remained on very friendly terms with the team there.  ""Blockchain is one of the most inspirational companies I have ever had the pleasure to work with,"" he said. ""It’s also one of the best bitcoin companies around. At the same time, there are other great companies. OKCoin is definitely one of them.""",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/06/12/blockchain-exec-joins-largest-chinese-exchange-okcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/11d56f636085616ea1805fe62e6ed7267bff9854-1000x740.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
