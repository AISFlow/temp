42421454,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoMhR,1663512600,Institutions Are Still 'Wait-And-See' With Ethereum,"The Merge has finally happened, and while bitcoin remains the preferred cryptocurrency of institutions (and one nation-state, El Salvador), Ethereum’s new consensus mechanism – and the scalability that is supposed to go with it – may attract some interest away from its bigger, older brother as the biting cold of the crypto winter continues.  Still, institutions may be hesitant to jump all in on ether just yet. One reason is regulatory uncertainty. U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler said proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies may be viewed as securities, though the regulator said he wasn’t talking about any specific coins. Nevertheless, his comments helped cause ether’s price to take a hit Thursday.  Meanwhile, it seems that if there were any flows from bitcoin to ether, much of that was stanched with the onset of the Merge.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Sunday.  At the start of the day – Sept. 15 – that the Merge happened, ether was trading for roughly 0.0817 BTC on Binance, according to data from TradingView. Fifteen hours later, it was changing hands at 0.0746 BTC and continued falling.  Read more: The Ethereum Merge Is Done, Opening a New Era for the Second-Biggest Blockchain  That’s a depressing chart, one may think. Except that’s only five days of data.  Let’s step back and look at how ether has been trading against bitcoin since the early days of the former’s life.  The Beacon Chain bottom and other ratios  The Beacon Chain, with which Ethereum ultimately merged, was launched Dec. 1, 2020. At the time, ether cost 0.0313 BTC. Thus, it has more than doubled in value since then.  Still, that doesn’t say anything about institutional interest. After all, prices can move based entirely on retail interest.  Trying to gauge institutional interest may be a bit tricky. For instance, using futures volumes isn’t as clear as one may expect. We see that, on a ratio of dollar volume basis, ether futures have been regularly outpacing bitcoin futures since July, according to data from Skew.com, though it recently took a hit.  That doesn’t tell us much about institutions because some of the exchanges Skew uses for data cater to retail investors with high risk tolerance.  There is at least one futures exchange, of course, that might be a good proxy for Wall Street’s interest and that’s the CME. The ratio of volumes between the two cryptocurrencies is way different:  The CME’s ratio of ether to bitcoin futures is decidedly all over the place, but it’s evident that dollar volumes for ether contracts on the CME have yet to surpass that of bitcoin futures contracts.  Read more: Ethereum Merge Has Tied Ether Futures Activity to Staking Yields, Traders Say  In the spot market, though, exchanges themselves can get a sense of the players interested in a currency.  “In terms of the volume increase in ETH this week, it was actually led by institutions, and that’s a significant part of our exchange business,” said Bitstamp USA CEO Bobby Zagotta on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” program Friday. There was “about 56% increase in volume from institutions versus, I think, [a] 35% increase in volume from retail users.”  A lot of that, Zagotta said, could be attributed to investors “selling the news” with the success of the Merge.  Quiet before the rally?  Meanwhile, ether’s drop in price didn’t just happen against bitcoin; it happened versus the U.S. dollar as well. Though the drop disappointed HODLers this past week, there are those who aren’t ruling out enormous upside down the road.  Matthew Sigel, VanEck’s head of digital assets research, likens ether’s performance versus USD after the Merge to what happened to bitcoin after significant changes.  “There are plenty of examples of big crypto developments, including bitcoin halvings, where the price traded in a range for weeks or months,” Sigel said on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” program Thursday. “It just takes one major stakeholder to make a decision to buy after some stability in the network. That can take days, weeks, months – who knows?”  Read more: SEC’s Gensler Signals Extra Scrutiny for Proof-of-Stake Cryptocurrencies: Report  Sigel, who has a five-year price target on ether of $8,000, noted four times as much ETH was staked on the Ethereum network in the six hours after the Merge than in the entire history of the Beacon Chain prior.  “It seems pretty clear that those who are in the markets are now making the decision to commit and lock up that liquidity,” he said. “That’s probably a trend that will continue over time, so the early results are, I think, pretty encouraging notwithstanding the price action.”",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | TRADING,Lawrence Lewitinn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/09/18/institutions-are-still-wait-and-see-with-ethereum,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3f1c1c0bd467c46fd20a5a492fa2b4840582e457-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

New developments, partnerships in Decentraland contribute to price spike Decentraland social mentions amplified by 89.07% MANA price up by 1.04% There are so many exciting developments happening for Decentraland (MANA), such as the partnership of StadioPlus with LaLiga, a Spanish football league giant. The partnership allows LaLiga to feature themed plots of virtual land starred in Vegas City, which happens to own the biggest entertainment, games, and sports areas of Decentraland. With that being said, a bullish reversal is possible, off-shooting the $0.84 barrier and peaking towards the $1.26 mark.

42416208,c03DFnfLU3SbZvH4Pubxz5,1663503253,"SEC, Ripple Call for Immediate Ruling in Suit Over Whether XRP Sales Violated Securities Laws","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple Labs each want a federal judge to rule either that the crypto company affiliated with the XRP cryptocurrency violated federal securities laws or otherwise dismiss the lawsuit without requiring a lengthy trial.  The SEC and Ripple both filed motions for summary judgment in the Southern District of New York, asking District Judge Analisa Torres to make a ruling based on the arguments filed in accompanying documents. The documents were posted to a federal court database Friday.  The SEC sued Ripple Labs, CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Chairman Chris Larsen in December 2020 (a day before former SEC Chair Jay Clayton stepped down from the role) on allegations that it had raised over $1.3 billion by selling XRP in unregistered securities transactions. Ripple maintained that XRP sales and trading did not meet the tenets of the Howey Test, a U.S. Supreme Court case that has acted as a way to determine whether something is a security for the last several decades.  The parties have filed various discovery motions over the past two years, without really litigating the actual underlying issue – whether Ripple violated securities law by selling XRP. The motions for summary judgment mean the parties are asking the court to actually decide whether either the SEC or Ripple has provided enough to prove one way or another whether there was a violation.  The SEC argued, among other things, that various statements by Ripple's executives demonstrate that Ripple sold XRP, and XRP investors bought the cryptocurrency with the belief that their holdings would spike in value over time.  ""Ripple publicly touted the various steps it was taking and would take to find a 'use' for XRP and to protect the integrity and liquidity of the XRP markets,"" the SEC said in its filing.  For its part, one of Ripple's arguments was that there was no contract between the company and XRP investors, and that there was no common enterprise, one of the requirements under Howey.  Many XRP holders buying through exchanges wouldn't have known who they were purchasing the tokens from, the company's filing said.  ""Even if the SEC were to engage in a belated, post-discovery transaction-by-transaction analysis to identify XRP offers and sales with contracts, its claim would still fail as a matter of law. Not one of those contracts granted post-sale rights to recipients as against Ripple or imposed post-sale obligations on Ripple to act for the benefit of those recipients,"" the filing said.",NEUTRAL,XRP,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | XRP,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/09/18/sec-ripple-call-for-immediate-ruling-in-suit-over-whether-xrp-sales-violated-securities-laws,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5fd394b5f82789a6786cd57bad1bec72419b9815-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
