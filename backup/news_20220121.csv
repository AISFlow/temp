42375463,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw84gT,1642801509,Ethereum Could Hold Lead as Dominant Smart-Contract Blockchain: Coinbase Analysts,"Don't write off Ethereum just yet.  The second-largest blockchain network by market capitalization after Bitcoin has become the dominant venue for some of the hottest cryptocurrency innovations, from decentralized finance (DeFi) to non-fungible tokens (NFT).  The network's popularity – and the high fees of transacting on it – has inspired a bevy of competitors aiming to undercut Ethereum with lower costs, faster speeds and higher throughput. Speculation that up-and-coming ""ETH killers"" or layer 1 blockchain alternatives such as Solana, Binance Smart Chain and even Cardano might one day overtake the market leader has sent the rivals' token prices soaring.  But analysts at Coinbase Institutional, which provides cryptocurrency research to big investors, say Ethereum might succeed in staving off the upstarts.  Ethereum’s layer 2, or companion system, which works alongside the main blockchain to speed transactions at lower cost, may help to stave off competition from other layer 1, or base layer, protocols. Planned upgrades to Ethereum itself, such as a full transition to a proof-of-stake blockchain from the current proof-of-work system as well as the introduction of sharding may also help.  As the ecosystem’s scalability improves, users of decentralized applications, or dapps, may refrain from looking for faster and cheaper alternatives to Ethereum, Coinbase Institutional said in a recent reporthttps://assets.ctfassets.net/7ca8qfn907uv/6rAJu49TzJRGEPkJEH2dHW/aa40f48ddfa4af4d5edf3dbe68ffde96/MktReport_2022.01.12_ETH_2.0_Killer__4_.pdf.  Coinbase Institutional says it still expects ""multiple chains to coexist in the crypto space in the near term,"" but Ethereum could keep its throne.  ""We do think that the culmination of [layer 2] scaling solutions combined with upgrades like the Beacon Chain merge and sharding could limit progress for alternative [layer 1s] in their current form,"" according to the Coinbase Institutional report.  Proof-of-stake transition  The Ethereum Blockchain is about to transition to a proof-of-stake consensus model from the energy-intensive proof-of-work mechanism the Bitcoin blockchain uses. This will happen by merging with the Beacon Chain – effectively a beta version of the future proof-of-stake blockchain that's already up and running.  The changes should help reduce energy consumption and computational power on Ethereum. While this does not guarantee faster transactions and lower gas fees, the availability of layer 2 systems like zero knowledge (zk) rollups can attract developers and encourage capital to stay in the ecosystem.  The development is likely to narrow layer 1 alternatives’ opportunities in the second half of 2022, according to the Coinbase analysts.  Zk-Rollups bundle transactions together and execute them in an off-chain environment before sending the updated transaction data back to Ethereum. The scalability that can be achieved as rollups gain more widespread use could be key to the success of Ethereum 2.0, according to Coinbase Institutional.

Alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) led the way lower on Friday given their higher risk profile relative to bitcoin. Ether, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, was down about 13% over the past 24 hours, compared with a 14% drop in AVAX and a 16% drop in FTM over the same period.  Despite the losses, some analysts still foresee a short-term bounce. ""We expect BTC to find a bid around the $35K mark, close to 50% from the top. In the short term, we can bounce to challenge the $45K-$50K zone, but the overall outlook remains bearish as liquidity remains tight,"" Pankaj Balani, CEO of Delta Exchange, a crypto derivatives trading platform, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  For now, technical indicators show nearby support at about $37,000 for bitcoin, although stronger support at $30,000 could stabilize a deeper correction.  ""Many altcoins are into support at their summertime 2021 lows, making it critical that bitcoin holds support as it sets the tone for the cryptocurrency space,"" Katie Stockton, managing director of Fairlead Strategies, a technical research firm, wrote in a Friday briefing. Stockton assigns a 30%-70% probability of a continued breakdown below current BTC price levels.  Latest prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $38349, −9.92%    ●Ether (ETH): $2752, −13.62%    ●S&P 500 daily close: $4398, −1.89%    ●Gold: $1832 per troy ounce, −0.57%    ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 1.75%     Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time.

Liquidation spike  According to data from CoinGecko, the total market cap of the cryptocurrency industry has fallen 11% to $1.9 trillion as of Friday afternoon U.S. time from an all-time high of $3.1 trillion in November.  The drop in total market cap has exposed many crypto traders to significant risk. According to Coinglass, there has been nearly $600 million in liquidations during the last 12 hours. Bitcoin led the liquidation pack at $250 million, followed by ether at $163 million and SOL at $10.9 million.  According to OKLink, the liquidation volume on decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens reached $34.3 million on Friday, the highest since December.  Liquidations in the crypto market happen when a trader has insufficient funds to fund a margin call – or a call for extra collateral demanded by the exchange to keep the trading position funded. They are especially common in futures trading.  Bitcoin drawdown deepens  Bitcoin is roughly 40% below its all-time high of $69,000, which is a significant drawdown. The previous drawdown extreme was in July when BTC settled near $28,000 after falling roughly 50% from its peak. BTC is vulnerable to extreme losses, similar to what occurred in 2018 when the decline reached 80%.  Bitcoin's peak-to-trough declines have been less severe over the past year, especially given the long-term uptrend in price and the decline in volatility.  The chart below, created using Koyfin, a financial data provider, shows bitcoin's historical drawdown and the cryptocurrency's 90-day correlation with the S&P 500 in the second panel.  Altcoin roundup  Altcoin decoupling narrative goes up in smoke: The developing narrative of ether and altcoins decoupling from bitcoin in an adverse macro environment evaporated on Friday as a sell-off in stocks and the largest cryptocurrency caused extensive damage to the broader crypto market. All cryptocurrencies appear to be correlated to equities now. Even ether, which is more associated with DeFi and non-fungible tokens (NFT) than with the inflation trade, seems to be tracking equities, according to Omkar Godbole. Read more here.  DeFi token demand dries up as traders exit: DeFi tokens are among the worst performers in Friday’s gloomy market. Fantom, AVAX, LUNA and UNI have all plunged by more than 10% over the past 24 hours. Some analysts have been bullish on DeFi and DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) tokens while being bearish on bitcoin, according to a recent report published by Huobi, a crypto exchange. But reality has shown otherwise so far. Uniswap’s UNI token hit its all-time high transaction volume, or more than 61% above the volume in last year's fourth quarter, Messari wrote in a report.  SundaeSwap’s rocky start: The first decentralized cryptocurrency exchange on the Cardano blockchain went live this week, but users have complained that transactions are failing and they aren't receiving their swapped tokens. Similar to UNI, which powers Uniswap, SundaeSwap has its own token, SUNDAE, but the data websites CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko don't have any pricing information, according to Lyllah Ledesma.

MicroStrategy used non-GAAP rules, or measures that don’t comply with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, to show what its income would have been if it didn’t have to impair its bitcoin holdings. Bloomberg was the first to report on the comment letters.  Under standard accounting rules, the value of digital assets such as cryptocurrencies must be recorded at their cost and then only adjusted if their value is impaired, or goes down. But if the price rises, that does not get reflected until an asset is sold.  The SEC told MicroStrategy in a filing on Dec. 3 that “...we object to your adjustment for bitcoin impairment charges in your non-GAAP measures. Please revise to remove this adjustment in future filings.”  In mid-December, MicroStrategy replied to the SEC that it would “revise its disclosures of non-GAAP measures in future filings to remove the adjustment for impairment losses and gains on sale related to bitcoin, as requested by the Commission,” according to a filing.  MicroStrategy held about 124,391 bitcoins on its balance sheet as of late December, which were worth about $4.3 billion at current prices. The company’s CEO, Michael Saylor, is a bitcoin bull, likening the cryptocurrency to “digital gold,” and has said many times the company does not plan to sell its bitcoin holdings.  The company didn’t immediately respond to CoinDesk’s request for additional comment.  MicroStrategy shares were down about 17% in Friday’s trading session, with most of the declines occurring earlier in the day as bitcoin prices continued to slump sharply.  Mark Palmer, an analyst at BTIG, wrote on Friday that he thinks the reporting changes the company will have to make are ""inconsequential as far as the value of the company and the stock are concerned.""

13401261,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/?p=225962,1642800640,Overview of Third Generation Crypto – Cardano,"Cardano is one of the most widely used types of cryptocurrency, a type of digital currency that can only be used online. Cardano was founded in 2015 and first traded publicly in October 2017 for a few pennies per token. The currency is now worth more than $1.20 in January 2022, after having peaked at more than $3 in the previous 52 weeks. It is one of the top ten most valuable cryptocurrencies in total value. Cardano was established by Charles Hoskinson, a co-founder of Ethereum, another renowned cryptocurrency, and it uses blockchain technology to run on a decentralized public ledger. Like an unending receipt, Blockchain administers and monitors the cryptocurrency, documenting, and arranging every transaction that occurs with it. This decentralized mechanism validates transactions, checks their integrity, and aids in the system&apos;s overall stability and error-free operation. In addition, Cardano has a &apos;proof-of-stake&apos; method, in which currency owners are entrusted with verifying transactions in exchange for a reward. This &apos;staking&apos; incentive might be a fun way to get money. What Is the Origin of Third Generation Crypto Cardano Coins? According to CoinMarketCap, there were approximately 33.5 billion ADA in circulation as of January 2022. Therefore, the entire supply of coins is limited to 45 billion. Cardano is similar to Bitcoin in that it has a fixed quantity of 21 million units.

Of course, bitcoin (BTC-USD -7.2%), which is seen as a proxy for MSTR stock, is falling well below its $40K key level to five-month lows. Specifically, the SEC objects MicroStrategy (MSTR) from using non-GAAP principles to show what its income would have been if it didn&apos;t have an impairment charge, Bloomberg notes. Note that bitcoin (BTC-USD) is classified as an intangible asset under GAAP principles, meaning companies that don&apos;t qualify as investment firms record digital assets at historical cost and only adjust it if its value declines, Bloomberg cites the SEC&apos;s letters.

GGG Partners, an Atlanta-based bankruptcy trustee and debt-restructuring consultant, sent Tantra's creditors a letter Thursday stating that it had been appointed liquidation manager to wind down the company, and that it would be responsible for monetizing any assets. A copy of the letter was obtained by CoinDesk and confirmed by multiple people close to the situation.  Katie Goodman, managing partner at GGG, said she couldn't comment beyond the letter when reached by CoinDesk on her mobile phone. CoinDesk also sought comment from Tantra Labs through multiple platforms, including messages via LinkedIn to several top executives who couldn’t be reached.  The letter contained a message from Russell LaCour, identified as Tantra's CEO, in which the executive attributed the ""severe degradation of the performance in its portfolio"" partly to a recent widening in a closely watched crypto markets gauge known as the ""GBTC discount.""  ""When Tantra Labs was created, the objective was to return the most competitive BTC- and ETH-denominated returns in crypto,"" LaCour was quoted in the letter as saying. ""In the period leading to today’s decision by the company's executive board, however, the company noticed severe degradation of performance in its portfolio. This degradation, combined with other events occurring in the markets in which Tantra operates, led to the company's balance sheet being put in a precarious position.""  He cited factors including ""GBTC discounted to unprecedented lows,"" ""directional portfolio performance degradation"" and ""interest spreads collapsing.""  According to LaCour, the executive board ""immediately explored a restructuring of the balance sheet, as well as other strategic options.""  ""The Executive Board simultaneously engaged in negotiations to raise funds with a view to potentially continuing the business but were ultimately unsuccessful in raising the necessary capital,"" LaCour said.  ""Ultimately, after significant discussion and consideration in consultation with outside counsel and other professional advisors, the executive board determined that, in view of all the circumstances, it is in the best interest of the company to wind up operations, liquidate our balance sheet and effectuate an orderly and fair and equitable distribution of our assets.""  The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, or GBTC, is the world's largest cryptocurrency fund, and it trades as a stock. Due to a variety of factors the share price recently has been trading at a record discount to the value of the underlying bitcoin in the fund.  The discount reached a record of 28% this week. As recently as early 2021, the share price traded at a premium, but it tilted negative in February of last year and has been on a steady decline since. Grayscale has said it wants to convert the trust into an exchange-traded fund, but so far the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has refused to approve a physical bitcoin-backed ETF.  In the meantime, redemptions aren't allowed, so investors who don't want to sell their shares in the open market have to keep paying management fees to Grayscale. (Grayscale is a unit of Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.)  Tantra Labs, which is focused on bitcoin, initially attracted deposits by promising $100 in BTChttps://get.tantralabs.io/earn-100/ after signing up and 12% (later 6%) APY.  According to a post by tantra_labs on Reddit, the company had over $80 million assets under management as of October.  Grayscale trade  Accredited investors can buy shares in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust directly at the net asset value (NAV) in daily private placements by depositing bitcoin or U.S. dollars. The shares can be sold in the secondary market only after a six-month lock-in period. The trust is a closed-end fund, meaning coins deposited remain locked forever.  For several reasons the GBTC shares consistently traded at a double-digit premium to the NAV until early February. As such, institutions would lock in bitcoin or U.S. dollars (USD) in return for shares priced at NAV and offload shares at a premium six months later, pocketing the spread.  Grayscale’s popularity surged at the end of 2020 when the premium on GBTC shares rose to a record-high 40% on Dec. 17. Some investors bought GBTC shares and simultaneously sold bitcoin futures, ramping up returns. Futures traded at a premium of 15% or more back then.

42375473,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw84rn,1642794460,Here’s Why Bitcoin Tumbled 11% in 24 Hours,"The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization began to drop Thursday around 19:00 UTC (2 p.m. ET), following the lead of the equity market, which saw a sharp decline into the U.S. 4 p.m. close.  Here’s what analysts are saying is behind the fall in price:  1. Negative market sentiment  Bitcoin’s (BTC) fall in price is a simple continuation of the same trend that has been occurring in the last few weeks – negative market sentiment. “This sentiment is fueled by a slew of gloomy news that overwhelms any form of objective asset data,” said Jason Deane, analyst at Quantum Economics. Although Deane’s long-term outlook is positive, he thinks that the current price action will probably continue in the immediate/short-term, and that further downward pressure is possible. “Once fear sets in, it takes a while to break and you simply have to wait for capitulation before you can move back to ""normalized"" ranges.”  2. Leveraged long positions  Another reason, according to Ben McMillan, founder of IDX Digital Assets, is leveraged long positions, which exacerbated the sell-off into the Asian open on Friday. “This is nearly always the case with bitcoin,” said McMillan, who said that “$40,000 was an important support which has now turned into a resistance level and we could certainly see more downside over the weekend.”  3. BTC is moving in conjunction with traditional markets  Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market as a whole is acting as a high-sentiment beta asset – meaning it is moving in tandem with the broader markets and is more impacted by the recent negative sentiment, according to Lucas Outumuro, head of research at IntoTheBlock. “Macroeconomic fears and poor technology company earnings have also exacerbated this correlation,” said Outumuro.  At press time, bitcoin was trading at $38,446, according to CoinDesk data.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | RESEARCH,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/21/heres-why-bitcoin-tumbled-11-in-24-hours,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8cdeedadb2f53f5cf4a8af308d0fea0dd8916604-1398x1270.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42375479,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw850b,1642793510,Crypto Market Cap Falls Below $2T Amid Sell-Off,"Cryptocurrencies are getting rekt.  Crypto blue-chips bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) breached key $40,000 and $3,000 support levels late Thursday evening, sending the broader alternative coin (altcoin) market into free fall.  According to data from CoinGecko, the total market cap of the cryptocurrency industry fell 11% to $1.9 trillion as of Friday afternoon during U.S. trading hours, down from an all-time high of $3.1 trillion in November.  Most major cryptocurrencies suffered double-digit losses and the recent slew of corrections increasingly signal bear market territory.  With the Nasdaq composite stock index down 5% in the past week, the sell-off in cryptocurrency markets appears to be echoing the movements of tech stocks.  There appears to be little safety from the bloodshed. Recent altcoin winners including Near Protocol’s NEAR (-17.5%), Fantom’s FTM (-15.4%) and Cosmos’ ATOM (-12.0%) tokens also suffered in the Friday sell-off.  NEAR, FTM and ATOM’s relatively strong performance against BTC and ETH on a year-to-date basis has some traders speculating about an altcoin decoupling. At least for the moment, today’s market downturn is sending crypto asset correlations up.  However, ATOM remains one of the only major tokens hovering in positive territory year to date (+3.0%).  So long, SoLunAvax  Many of the alternative layer 1 blockchain tokens that earned top performer status in 2021 have seen their market capitalizations halved during the past few weeks.  While some have outperformed BTC and ETH (which are down 44% and 42%, respectively, from all-time highs), others are struggling to maintain their 2021 momentum.  “Ethereum-killer” Solana's SOL is down 52% from its all-time high. Terra’s LUNA and Avalanche’s AVAX tokens are down 30% and 59% from all-time highs, respectively.  Ethereum sidechain Polygon’s MATIC token is down 36% and Cardano’s ADA token is down 61% since their all-time highs in September, when the latter project announced the launch of their smart contracts.  Altcoins, which are riskier and typically trade at a higher volatility than BTC and ETH, suffered drawdowns as steep as 90-99% during the 2017-2018 crypto cycle.  Dog coins down  According to data from Messari, the biggest category of altcoin losers are meme coins. Dogecoin (DOGE) is now nearly 80% down from its all-time high last May, despite a recent tweet from Tesla CEO Elon Musk that temporarily sent DOGE up as much as 33%.

Intraday oversold signals were not enough to sustain bids, which means longer-term indicators are more reliable to determine bitcoin’s price direction.  BTC was trading around $38,000 at press time and is down about 10% over the past 24 hours.  The slowdown in upside momentum on monthly and weekly charts has been a persistent theme since December. As the long-term uptrend weakens, sellers typically outweigh buyers despite occasional oversold signals.  Further, when drawdowns (percent decline from peak to trough) become severe, short-term traders tend to reduce their position sizes and tighten trade parameters around intraday support and resistance zones.  Bitcoin is roughly 40% below its all-time high of $69,000, which is a significant drawdown. The previous drawdown extreme was in July when BTC settled near $28,000 after falling roughly 50% from its peak.  For now, initial support is around $37,000, which could stabilize the current sell-off. The relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart is the most oversold since May 19, which preceded two months of sideways trading before a rebound occurred.

Coins Matured To 12-18 Months Revisit A High Not Seen Since 2 Years As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, BTC hodlers have held strong recently as coins aged 12-18 months have seen a sharp spike recently. The relevant on-chain indicator here is the Bitcoin Sum Coin Age (SCA) Distribution that shows the distribution of coins among the different holders in the market. The metric works by looking at each coin on the chain and measuring how many days it has been since it was last moved. Based on the age, these coins are put into different categories. For instance, if a coin has been sitting still since 12-18 months ago, it is included in the 12-18 months holder group. When the distribution of the long-term holders goes up, it means accumulation has been strong recently. Such a trend has usually been bullish for the price of Bitcoin as it shows a large number of holders refuse to sell at the current levels. On the other hand, when coins belonging to short-term holders move up, it means some long-term holders have decided to sell. This trend may be bearish for the price of the crypto.

42393990,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bsQdPJ,1642791473,Why Brazil Is the Big Latin American Bet for Global Crypto Exchanges,"Amid a crypto boom in Brazil, several global exchanges see the country as Latin America’s main market in 2022.  Binance, Coinbase, Crypto.com and other exchanges’ interest in Brazil has been growing as the region’s largest economy wrestles with significant economic imbalances.  Brazil registered a 10% inflation rate in 2021 and a steady depreciation of the Brazilian real against the U.S. dollar, which pushed the local currency from $0.25 in January 2020 to $0.18 this month.  This article is part of CoinDesk Brasil, a brand-new partnership between CoinDesk and InfoMoney, one of Brazil's leading financial news publications. Follow CoinDesk Brasil on Twitter.  That cocktail of macroeconomic imbalances fed the crypto boom in recent years. In 2020, crypto exchanges began to notice that Brazilian stablecoin traders were quadrupling in number.  Between January and November 2021, locals traded $11.4 billion in stablecoins and almost tripled the total traded in 2020, while bitcoin trading reached $10.8 billion over the same period, according to Receita Federal, the Brazilian tax authority.  Brazilians have incentives to purchase crypto instead of U.S. dollars to hedge against inflation or devaluation. When acquiring foreign currency, Brazilians are forced to pay a tax on financial operations – IOF is its acronym in Portuguese – that ranges between 1.1% and 6.38%. The tax does not apply to stablecoins.  Moreover, the Brazilian Central Bank prohibits locals from saving U.S. dollars in a domestic bank account. To be sure, the monetary authority abolished that prohibition by approving a new exchange rate framework in December 2021, but it hasn’t implemented it yet.  Brazilians also prioritize crypto over other more traditional investments. According to data from the Central Bank of Brazil (BCB), as of August 2021 Brazilians held $50 billion in crypto, compared to $16 billion held in U.S. stocks.  Read more: Why Brazilians Are Turning to Stablecoins Like Tether  Locals are familiar with digital money, as the country leads the way in digital payments in Latin America. In October 2020, the BCB launched a real-time retail payment system, Pix, which by November 2021 had more than 104 million users – in a country of 214 million – and concentrated more than 70% of total transactions.  In the crypto arena, the BCB plans to carry out the first tests of its CBDC in 2022, while the local senate will discuss three bills seeking to set the rules for the crypto ecosystem in the country.  Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, has a special interest in Brazil. “It is a key strategic market for Binance, for sure. It is the largest market in Latin America in all metrics and with enormous potential; and it is also very important for the company globally,” the company told CoinDesk in an email.  Over the past three years, Binance has focused on hiring Brazilians to strengthen its support team, the company said. Now, the exchange is looking for a general manager to lead its Brazilian business, according to one of eight job openings it has in the country.  In November 2020, Binance started accepting Brazilian reals through a fiat gateway, which boosted the number of active transacting users by 125% in 2021 compared with the previous year, the company told CoinDesk.  In that same month, crypto exchange Coinbase announced the creation of an engineering hub in Brazil, for which it has nine open positions on its careers page. The company appears to have a particular interest in payment services.  Singapore-based crypto exchange Crypto.com is another heavyweight looking to expand into Brazil.  According to Guilherme Sacamone, Crypto.com’s head of growth in Brazil, the company has been operating in the local market for ""a few months"" and its fiat wallet is already integrated with the government's payment system, Pix. In addition, Crypto.com launched a Visa debit card in Brazil, Sacamone told CoinDesk.  Crypto.com is also looking for a country manager to lead its Brazilian operation, in addition to strengthening its institutional customer base through hiring a director of institutional sales.  “Latin America is an important region for Crypto.com and Brazil, being its largest market, has become a global priority for the company,” Sacamone said.  Brazil is also starting to attract European exchanges. Bit2me, a Spanish crypto exchange that raised EUR 20 million via an initial coin offering in 2021, plans to land during the first quarter of 2022, Bit2Me's CEO, Andrei Manuel, told CoinDesk.  Bit2Me plans to allow users to buy and sell crypto with fiat and provide crypto to crypto trading. It has a team of 20 in Brazil and plans to hire 20 more employees in 2022 to boost its marketing, compliance, product and support teams, the executive added.  But the fervor for the Brazilian market is not limited to exchanges. The global payments company Ripple considers Brazil the key trigger to growth in Latin America. It is currently looking for a business development manager to coordinate ""strategic relationships"" that include “payment and fintech companies, financial institutions, and digital asset infrastructure players,” among others.  A regional fight  Regional crypto exchanges already operating in Spanish-speaking markets are also eyeing Brazil. But they face the challenge of competing with Brazil’s dominant local player, Mercado Bitcoin.  Founded in 2014, Mercado Bitcoin is the largest crypto exchange in Brazil, with 3.2 million users. It also raised $250 million in a Series B funding round from Softbank in 2021, making it the first Brazilian crypto unicorn.  Mercado Bitcoin's main competitor in Brazil is Bitso, a Mexico-based crypto exchange that raised $250 million in a Series C funding round that made it the first crypto unicorn in Latin America.  José Molina, Bitso’s vice president of marketing, told CoinDesk that the company plans to become the largest exchange in the country in 2022. Although it did not disclose its customer base in Brazil, Bitso told CoinDesk that its Brazilian business unit grew 97% in the last six months.  Bitso currently has more than 30 job openings in Brazil with the aim of “growing rapidly,” Molina said. The company hired Facebook veteran Vaughan Smith in August 2021 to boost its expansion in the country.  Bitso has more users than Mercado Bitcoin – 3.7 million versus 3.2 million – when accounting for Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Mexico, which are the markets in which it currently operates.  But the numbers may change in 2022, since Mercado Bitcoin is looking to expand into the Spanish-speaking part of Latin America through acquisitions in Argentina, Chile, Colombia and Mexico, 2TM CEO Roberto Dagnoni told CoinDesk in June.  Bitso is not the only Latin American crypto exchange targeting Brazil. In January 2021, Argentina-based crypto exchange Ripio acquired BitcoinTrade, the second-largest crypto exchange in Brazil.  For 2022, it plans to launch its corporate trading desk, Ripio OTC, aimed at institutional investors and high-net-worth traders, Ripio Brazil's country manager, Enrique Teixeira said. In parallel, the company is working on ""various payment products"" with Visa Brazil, including a crypto card and several projects with local fintech companies.

42411526,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOjqr,1642789893,Bukele's Bitcoin Is Not What Turkey Needs,"Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele met with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on Thursday in what was reportedly the first executive summit between the two countries. Despite dropping hints ahead of the meeting, Bukele reportedly didn’t talk to Erdogan about El Salvador’s best-known domestic policy: national Bitcoin adoption.  That’s likely just as well, because bitcoin isn’t a meaningful solution for Turkey’s monetary woes. The reasons for this are complex and highlight the rising need to understand bitcoin not just on its own terms, but as a novel force disrupting an established global monetary system, which already has its own arcane dynamics.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Bukele and Erdogan’s meeting did come in the midst of a Turkish monetary crisis that has led citizens to swap their lira for crypto at record rates, once again demonstrating the novel utility of an instrument like bitcoin as a hedge for individual savers. But Turkey’s monetary structure is so vastly different from El Salvador’s that BTC simply isn’t a relevant solution to the crisis at the national level.  El Salvador’s move to adopt bitcoin seemed broadly sensible to many observers, including me, because the country was already fully “dollarized” – it does not have its own currency or monetary policy. Swapping dollars for bitcoin offered a marginal reduction in Salvadoran dependence on U.S. monetary policy, over which they have no control and which has recently become inflationary.  Turkey’s situation is much different, and very complex. Rather than being fully dollarized, Turkey is only largely dollarized – while it manages its own currency, the lira (TL), the U.S. dollar (USD) makes up about half of the bank deposit base there. As Turkish economist Lutfullah Bingol recently laid out on Bloomberg’s “Odd Lots” podcast, Turks essentially use dollars as a “hedge against tail risk” in the lira. At times of high lira volatility or inflation, they shift holdings to dollars for stability. (“Odd Lots” has done a great job providing a nuanced introduction to the situation. I highly recommend their coverage.)  That’s a huge part of Turkey’s current monetary problems, and the reason BTC isn’t a helpful fix. The availability of a dollar hedge exacerbates monetary instability there – speaking very broadly, a sinking lira can create a downward USD-TL spiral as more Turks sell lira for dollars.  This problem is rooted in the late 1980s when Turkey opened its capital accounts, allowing the lira to trade and float against other international currencies, at a point where it was still very much an emerging economy subject to periods of instability. At least according to Bingol, this opening was “premature,” coming before the lira was robust enough to withstand global trading (for comparison, China, now the world’s second-largest economy, still has not opened capital accounts to allow the yuan to float). Over the years that has eroded the lira’s domestic role. Worst of all, dollar dominance tends to rise precisely during instability like the current crisis, reducing the effectiveness of lira monetary policy at the moment it is most badly needed.  Reducing dollar dominance in a foreign market is known a “de-dollarization,” and it’s quite difficult, particularly in the middle of a crisis. Turkey is currently pursuing an intriguing strategy to resist further dollarization in the face of sharp inflation that would normally drive lira holders to USD en masse. Essentially, Turkey is offering lira holders a mirror of the hedge they would have in dollars – if the lira dips against USD, lira holders meeting certain conditions will be compensated with more lira.  See also: Turkey Makes the Case for Bitcoin as Erdogan Runs the Autocrat’s Inflation Playbook | Opinion  This might not end well. When the Turkish policy was announced, some crypto observers noted its similarity to the so-called (3, 3) staking structure behind a “non-pegged stablecoin” called OHM, which uses interacting flows of multiple tokens to seek price stability in one of them. OHM has had a very rough month, and “algorithmic stablecoins'' in general are at high risk of arbitrage exploitation and collapse.  Turkey’s new lira policy broadly rhymes with the structure of many algo stablecoins, and more generally with attempts to “peg” any currency that has been allowed to float. The policy is “the government writing effectively put options on the lira,” according to fund manager Paul McNamara during a second “Odd Lots” episode on the topic. In very broad terms, Turkey has promised that if the lira falls against the dollar, it will pay lira holders with more lira – which it could wind up forced to effectively print, exacerbating the inflationary spiral that it was hoping to fight in the first place.  The core problem here is that Turkey’s economy and monetary policy are being badly mismanaged. As McNamara points out, the surest path to de-dollarization is “macro stability,” which makes foreign currencies riskier to hold. But absent that fix, Turkey’s proximate monetary problem is its citizens’ easy access to dollars as a currency hedge. Adding crypto to the mix only gives people more options for fleeing the lira, and Erdogan has no motivation to encourage that.",NEGATIVE,BTC,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | REGULATION | TRADING,David Z.

42375474,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw84t3,1642789727,Newly Public Core Scientific Leads Slump in Crypto Mining Stocks,"Core Scientific (CORZ) has gone public at a particularly inauspicious time, with bitcoin in a prolonged slump that has seen prices fall below $40,000 for the first time in months.  As a result, shares of Core Scientific, one of the largest bitcoin mining companies by production capacity, have fallen about 22% in the last two days since going public via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC).  The stocks of other publicly traded miners, which are highly leveraged to the price movements of the cryptocurrencies they mine, have also dropped. On Friday, shares of Hut 8 (HUT) fell about 12%, Hive (HIVE) dropped more than 9%, Riot Blockchain (RIOT) dipped 7%, and Marathon Digital (MARA) fell about 5%.  SPAC Merger  Austin, Texas-based Core Scientific went public on Thursday after merging with Power & Digital Infrastructure Acquisition in a SPAC transaction. Core Scientific has self-mining operations and hosts other mining machines in its facilities. The company operates data centers in Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina and North Dakota, and said that as of Sept. 30, over 50% of the power used in its operations was generated from non-carbon emitting sources.  “While there could be some volatility around the de-SPAC this week [in Core’s stock], we view any weakness as a buying opportunity,” said Wall Street investment bank D.A. Davidson’s analyst Christopher Brendler in a research note ahead Tuesday of the initial public offering. “Given Core's more diversified top line (~50% hosting), changes in our Bitcoin network estimates do not affect Core as much as other names in our miner coverage that are pure-play miners,” he added.  Brendler estimated that bitcoin will reach $56,000 by end of 2022, and that the network hashrate will hit 312 exahash per second (EH/s) over the same time period. The network’s hashrate was about 205 EH/s on Thursday, according to data analytics firm Glassnode.  Read more: Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Sets New All-Time High  Core Scientific had about 6.6 EH/s of self-mining computing power at the end of 2021, and about 6.9 EH/s for its hosting business. By comparison, Marathon Digital said on Jan. 1 that its computing hashrate was 3.5 EH/s and that it planned to increase that to 23.3 EH/s by early 2023.  The performance of miners that have recently gone public, such as Core Scientific, Stronghold Digital (SDIG), Iris Energy (IREN) and Terawulf (WULF), has been lackluster as the price of bitcoin has fallen more than 40% from its all-time high in November and competition in the sector grows.  Reasons for optimism  Investors, however, are still looking to put their money in new crypto-linked companies as there are few options in the public market, according to Marcus New, founder and CEO of InvestX, a private equity marketplace provider and fintech firm. “Market sentiment remains high partially because there are very few publicly traded options creating restricted supply at the early majority stage of the cycle for blockchain/crypto,” New said.  And as the awareness surrounding crypto, decentralized finance (DeFi), blockchain, Web 3 and the metaverse increases, so should investors' appetite to put their money in these growing businesses, New said.  “The markets need more IPOs and issuers to invest in. The public markets are highly unrepresented in this asset class,” he added.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING,Aoyon Ashraf,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/01/21/newly-public-core-scientific-leads-slump-in-crypto-mining-stocks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b8b562c87e3d7ab4818e76a4299350365d8bd31c-1500x844.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42375464,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw84hj,1642786524,Cardano-Based Decentralized Exchange SundaeSwap Off to Rocky Start,"SundaeSwap, the first decentralized cryptocurrency exchange on the Cardano blockchain, went live this week, but users have complained that transactions are failing and they aren't receiving their swapped tokens.  Similar to Uniswap’s UNI token, which powers the automated liquidity provider, SundaeSwap has its own token, SUNDAE, but the data websites CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko don't have any pricing information.  SundaeSwap announced Thursday on Twitter that “swapping is now live” on the decentralized exchange, or DEX.  Since then, users have complained on Twitter, Discord and Telegram that they have not received their tokens after swapping Cardano's ADA tokens for SUNDAE. Some said they had been waiting over nine hours.  SundaeSwap's website currently displays a notice when attempting to swap ADA for SUNDAE, stating: “The network is extremely congested at the moment. Swaps may fail or not go through until congestion decreases. Please be patient.”  After initial publication of this story, a representative for SundaeSwap sent the following comment:  The congestion on the Cardano network is understandably frustrating, but also evidence of the network working as intended to live up to its mission of stability and economic fairness. The network didn't crash, the security didn't decrease, and it didn't create exploitive fees for the end user. Instead, it is creating queues at various breakpoints throughout the system so that it can soak up and process as many orders as possible.     In the lead-up to SundaeSwap’s launch, Cardano’s ADA token was rallying. The price of the token went from $1.28 on Sunday to $1.55 on Monday.  ""Cardano had a lot riding on the successful launch of SundaeSwap to finally vindicate itself. Its supporters created a narrative that managed to see the ADA price rally 40%,” said Igneus Terrenus, head of communications at Bybit.  Read more: Cardano Price Surges on SundaeSwap DEX Catalyst  “The heightened attention became a curse, and brought to SundaeSwap more traffic than its team had prepared for,” Terrenus added. “Cardano has been such a target of ridicule and acrimony that it almost felt like this was completely predictable.”  Blockchain data suggests that Cardano whales – large holders of the cryptocurrency – have been able to swap their ADA for SUNDAE, whereas regular retail traders have suffered congestion and transaction issues.  In the SundaeSwap Discord chat, users reported getting “insufficient balance” errors and that their wallets had dropped to zero as a result of SundaeSwap’s teething problems. One user wrote: “I love Cardano and SundaeSwap, but as of now I have tried to process over 50 transactions and none have gone through.”  “It is fair to say that major launches can lead to a lot of congestion on the chain, resulting in slowing down transaction time,” said Denis Vinokourov, head of research at Corinthian Digital.  “Thus, in hindsight, it was inevitable, and, in fact, SundaeSwap Labs itself acknowledged the likely operational constraints and limitations that the blockchain and the DEX will exhibit on opening day,” he added.  Vinokourov said a DEX is far from the most complicated of product launches.  “There are much more complicated iterations that have been launched by other smart-contract blockchains, and one would have expected more stress testing to prepare for the real-world traffic onslaught,” he said.  The price of Cardano’s ADA token is down 15% in the last 24 hours, though bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies were down in what appeared to be a broad market sell-off. At press time, ADA was trading at $1.19.  Omkar Godbole contributed to this story.

Crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) was down about 10%, while MicroStrategy (MSTR), which held about 124,391 bitcoins on its balance sheet as of late December, fell about 8%. Shares of Robinhood (HOOD), whose crypto trading revenue has increased significantly in the last year, were down about 4%.  The stock declines comes as bitcoin has fallen almost 11% in the past 24 hours to $38,644, trading below $40,000 for the first time in months.

This is a crucial point for the digital asset given that it has successfully maintained its position above this level throughout all of the crashes and dips of the previous month.

42411538,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOnkE,1642783359,Who Writes the Story of the Metaverse?,"IRL.  This acronym has become shorthand for the regular, offline human existence in which we all participate, a realm lying outside of that new digital alternative to which investors, entrepreneurs and media commentators are increasingly drawn: the metaverse.  “In real life” evokes a place where our bodies are physically present, one in which we actually live. It also implies, by extension, that the metaverse is unreal.  That might seem perfectly logical to you. If so, Ben Hunt is here to tell you you’re wrong.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The always thought-provoking essayist, whose writings at Epsilon Theory have brought poetry, philosophy and communication theory to the analysis of economic and financial phenomena, has penned a tour de force – the first of a three-part series – that calls on us all to urgently address what’s happening with the metaverse. Why? Because it’s as real as everything and anything that defines our civilization.  Hunt tells us to focus on the narrative-building work that’s starting to give the metaverse shape in our minds. It’s related to an idea we’ve often visited in Money Reimagined’s newsletter and podcast: that the institutions that define who we are and how we live – our religions, nations, laws, identities and, yes, our money – are social constructs, the product of shared stories that we all tacitly and often subconsciously believe in. Like Yuval Harari – whose work on the power of stories I often cite – he knows that, far from being a reason to doubt their legitimacy, the collective belief in made-up ideas is what gives these institutions their power.  Still, as powerful as these narratives are, they can change. They can be supplanted by new ones. Author Neil Gaiman said, “Ideas are more difficult to kill than people, but they can be killed, in the end.” Hunt reminds us that “slavery used to be a thing. Settling your differences through dueling used to be a thing. The divine right of kings used to be a thing” and that “Littering was not a thing. Owning pets was not a thing. Privacy was not a thing.”  Heck, 30 years ago “the internet” wasn’t a thing. And by that I don’t mean the routers, switches, fiber-optic cables and Wi-Fi modems that connect computers and enable the distribution of bits and bytes. I mean the abstract “place” where public discourse happens, where new forms of communities arise, where life is monitored, assessed and acted upon. That internet is a concept we collectively dreamed into existence.  Similarly, the metaverse will come to occupy a prominent, influential place in our imagination.  This won’t happen instantaneously. Its shape, meaning and impact on our lives will evolve over time – an evolution that individual human beings can and will influence.  Hunt offers an analogy here: Our future engagement with the metaverse could mimic how, with the help of science, we came to accept the real existence of an unseeable “microverse:” that realm of viruses, parasites and other microbes that we’ve since learned how to manipulate, sometimes in sinister ways.  He warns of the internet equivalent of gain-of-function research, where scientists have developed the power to alter the genetic mutation of microorganisms, singling out Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg as someone with an outsized (and unwarranted) capacity to steer the evolutionary direction of the metaverse. It’s up to us, Hunt writes, to ensure that this emerging real phenomenon serves humanity’s broad interest.  A real alien lifeform  Much of this way of thinking is familiar to me. I was lucky enough a few years back to be asked by digital media entrepreneur Oliver Luckett to be his co-author for “The Social Organism,” a book that views social media as a de facto biological phenomenon. Luckett helped me see that just as genes drive biological evolution, so, too, is the evolution of human culture shaped by memes. This is more than Twitter ideas shaping conversation. Richard Dawkins introduced the idea of memes in his 1975 book “The Selfish Gene” to posit that the spread of human ideas flows from competition between these core “units of replication.” The Social Organism argues that the internet has taken this process into overdrive.  Hunt’s essay takes that biological reference even further.  “Narratives are as real and as alive as you and me,” he writes. “When I say that narratives are alive, I don’t mean this as a metaphor. I truly believe that narratives are an alien lifeform in exactly the same way that viruses are an alien lifeform.”  Narratives are an alien lifeform? Note that Hunt is using the word “alien” to mean something that’s incomprehensible to us initially. Both narratives and viruses, he says, aren’t “observable or easily comprehensible within the human-scale macroverse – the familiar world of Newtonian physics and multicellular DNA-based organisms where all us humans, past, present and future, live out our lives.”  Just as we learned to view viruses and the microverse as real, so, too, will the metaverse eventually become part of our accepted reality. What’s at stake is who or what controls it, which is why this early narrative-forming phase is so important.  As we explored in last week’s column, whether or not blockchain technology is an integral part of this new iteration of the web, the bigger issue is whether we make the same mistakes of the “Web 2” era and allow centralized corporate entities shape “Web 3” in their interests rather than those of the general public.  Read more: A Crypto Guide to the Metaverse  Hunt zeroes his focus on Zuckerberg, whose renaming of Facebook as “Meta” should be seen as an early salvo in the battle to shape the metaverse narrative’s evolution. It seems like there may be more to come on this topic in the second part of Hunt’s Epsilon Theory trilogy, which is entitled “Narrative and Metaverse, Pt. 2: Gain of Function.”  The essayist’s take is not fatalistic. We can resist these outsized forces of control. But it is vital that we can recognize them and are ready to fight back.  “This is the battle of our lives,” Hunt writes. “This is always the battle of all human lives. The past, present and future of human freedom is not determined in the macroverse but in the metaverse, and it is here where we must make our stand. First we will write the words to see the metaverse. Then we will write the songs to change it.  “Clear eyes. Full hearts. Can’t lose.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Michael J.

42423844,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2hMvh,1642778230,"Binance Didn't Upgrade Customer Checks, Despite Promises to Regulators: Report","The world's largest crypto exchange kept weak know-your-customer (KYC) checks and did not properly cooperate with authorities, despite its public promises about compliance, Reuters said in an investigative report published Friday. The report was based on interviews with dozens of former employees of Binance, advisers and business partners, as well as the review of hundreds of documents.  According to the report, Binance has refused to answer regulators and partners' questions about its operations, turned down German police requests to help track down fraudsters and terrorists, and ignored its own compliance advisors' recommendations to avoid customers in countries with money laundering risk, all while publicly claiming to welcome regulation.  Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao also ignored senior staff when they voiced concerns about weak know-your-customer requirements, the report said.  The crypto exchange has received multiple warnings about its operations from regulators around the world about its activities, including in Singapore, Japan, the Cayman Islands and the U.K., while avoiding setting up global headquarters.  According to Reuters, in 2020, Binance acted against its own money laundering risk alerts for at least seven countries. Specifically, the ratings for Russia and Ukraine were ""manually"" downgraded from ""extreme"" to ""high,"" such that the exchange could continue offering services there, according to Reuters.

42423848,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2hNBh,1642777622,Important Disclosure About CoinDesk and Digital Currency Group,"Any for-profit news organization has to navigate a delicate balancing act to achieve quality, transparency and trust. At CoinDesk, we face a unique set of challenges because we are an independently operated, wholly owned subsidiary of Digital Currency Group (DCG), one of the largest investors in the industry we cover.  This article describes a recent change we made at CoinDesk with the goal of improving the quality of our product. Some may disagree with the decision we’ve made in this instance. But we are confident that this is an acceptable and necessary step given the evolution of the cryptocurrency space and certain marketplace realities of the media industry, all of which are described in detail below.  In 2022, CoinDesk is rolling out a program whereby certain high-performing employees throughout the ranks, most of whom have been here more than a year, receive stock appreciation rights (SAR) in DCG as part of their compensation. Initially, CoinDesk content employees were not going to be eligible for this program, meaning only certain members of other departments (sales, marketing, etc.) would be allowed to participate.  SARs give the holder exposure to equity, but they are not the same thing as equity. You can find a full explanation of how SARs work here. The upshot is they reward employees who stay at CoinDesk for a certain period of time with the potential to redeem them for cash payments based on DCG’s valuation growth subsequent to the granting of the SARs.  The reasons we initially planned to exclude content staff from the SARs program stemmed from our commitment to quality journalism: the potential conflict of interest, or public perception thereof, given that so many of the companies and assets we cover at CoinDesk are owned or partly owned by our parent company.  That commitment to quality and integrity has not changed. However, several other factors have convinced us that, in service of that same commitment, it now makes sense to revise the plan:  In a tight labor market for journalists with crypto expertise or other valuable skills and proven gumption, CoinDesk has been at a disadvantage because we had no way to offer them upside or ownership in the company. This, in itself, compromises our commitment to quality and integrity.  Inflation has reared its head, eroding salary increases and compounding the aforementioned challenges of recruitment and retention, notwithstanding our highly competitive market-rate benefits (401k match, 90% medical coverage).  Offering this incentive fits more with an emerging crypto community philosophy that trust is built by having skin in the game with high transparency rather than by rules and restrictions.  Hence, beginning in 2022, certain editors and reporters who have performed above expectations and in most cases have worked here for more than a year will be offered SARs awards as part of their compensation packages. A number of a factors boosted our comfort in making this move:  Employees are under no obligation to accept these awards.  Those who do accept will not be able to begin to cash out any portion of them until after a yearlong vesting period and only during predetermined “liquidity events” (currently just once a year). These constraints greatly diminish a journalist’s opportunity to profit from a favorable story.  Beyond the program’s basic rules of eligibility, CoinDesk management, and not DCG, has full autonomy over who is awarded SARs and the standards under which that determination is made.  Outright purchases of DCG stock remain off-limits to content employees.  Unlike the DCG employee stock purchase plan, holders of SARs are not provided with regular financial reporting of non-public information by DCG. (The access to this potentially compromising information was the main reason for continuing to prohibit stock purchases.)  Journalists who are not offered SARs remain eligible for annual pay increases and cash bonuses.  Disclosure policy  We are not requiring journalists who receive SARs to disclose this in their bios (as we do for crypto asset holdings above $1,000 in value). The main reason we do not require such disclosure in this instance is respect for their privacy: An employee's compensation, and how pay differs from person to person across a company, is an inherently private matter (unless the person is a senior government official or an executive at a publicly traded company or a tax-exempt nonprofit, none of which applies here) and employees should not be forced by CoinDesk to disclose such information. To be clear: CoinDesk in no way prohibits employees from discussing wages, salary, benefits or terms and conditions of employment with other employees or a third party like a union.  Instead, the standard disclosure that automatically appears at the bottom of all CoinDesk articles will be updated in short order to note that certain CoinDesk employees (including content employees) may receive exposure to DCG equity as part of their compensation. In addition, we will be adding a passage to our ethics page that spells this out.  We will continue to disclose our ownership in the text of any article that mentions DCG or its wholly owned subsidiaries. The automatic standard disclosure continues to link to lists of DCG’s portfolio companies and coin investments.  We reviewed the payoffs and challenges faced by many other media organizations that have, over the years, rewarded their journalists with stock or options in their parent companies (Vox, Vice, Buzzfeed, Mashable). There’s no shortage of them – many of those launched with venture capital financing over the last two decades employed this common Silicon Valley comp strategy. To be sure, CoinDesk ‘s situation is unique due to DCG’s wide presence in the industry we cover, so this was a tough decision.  But another thing that makes us unique is that we operate in a hyper-competitive labor market and there is a real premium for the scarce quality of crypto knowledge.  Long-term orientation  And there are several factors that mitigate the potential for conflict of interest and bias. Key among these are the long-term vesting of SARs and the breadth of DCG’s investments.  A reporter or editor who holds SARs would have little to gain from shilling or pulling punches for any asset or company owned by DCG. That’s in part because any gains in a company or coin valuation that result from a positively framed article are bound to be extremely short-lived (the market always wises up), while SARs take years to fully vest and can only be liquidated during one predetermined period each year.  Also, because DCG is exposed to such a wide cross-section of the industry, there are many variables that go into its valuation; a short-lived spike in the value of any one investment is unlikely to move the needle. One could argue that DCG’s uniquely broad investment in the entire crypto ecosystem means that, unlike most other companies, its interest in improving the quality of information about the industry overrides any particular, short-term interest it might have in one of its units receiving favorable coverage.  It’s also worth remembering that for several years CoinDesk and DCG have operated under a strict independence policy that forbids DCG employees from pressuring CoinDesk journalists for coverage or favorable treatment, and encourages CoinDesk employees to come forward and report any such attempts. You can read the full text of that policy on our ethics page.  The most direct and effective way any CoinDesk journalist can contribute to the valuation of the parent company is to make CoinDesk itself a better product – to reinforce our status as the leading, most trusted, most reliable media outlet in the field with an unwavering commitment to integrity. The development of a high-quality, incorruptible news source is in the long-term interest of the entire industry, not least of all DCG’s long-term interest. In this way, in the big picture, the interests of DCG shareholders and CoinDesk journalists are ultimately aligned – and we will continue to cover our parent, its subsidiaries, investment products, portfolio companies and coin holdings without fear or favor.

42393997,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bsQdox,1642777165,The UK Lawmakers Who Want to Use Brexit to Rethink Crypto Rules,"A country distancing itself from its neighbors and hardening its borders – as the U.K. has done with Brexit – might sound like a perverse thing to do, especially from the perspective of those in the borderless, 24/7 world of cryptocurrency.  However, some lawmakers see an interesting post-Brexit play for Great Britain amid crypto’s evolving patchwork of regulation. A recently convened group of U.K. parliamentarians, harking from across the political spectrum, may signify the first steps in a new direction.  Lisa Cameron, a member of Parliament for the Scottish National Party (SNP) and the chair of the Crypto and Digital Assets All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG), points out that Brexit was not her choice (over 60% of Scottish voters opted to remain in Europe). But with her cross-party crypto hat on, Cameron says it’s time to start exploring the potential benefits of Brexit – namely, “being able to chart your own path.”  “In terms of this particular field [crypto], I think it could be exciting – harnessing that for our economy, and for young people coming forward, young people doing coding at school,” Cameron said in an interview with CoinDesk.  Independent trade body CryptoUK is the secretariat of the APPG, meaning the office entrusted with administrative duties. Other parliamentary vice-chairs include Harriett Baldwin (Conservative), Martin Docherty-Hughes (SNP), Alexander Stafford (Conservative) and Lord Taylor of Warwick (non-affiliate). Also involved are Lord McNicol of West Kilbride (Labour), Bell Ribeiro-Addy (Labour), Lord Vaizey of Didcot (Conservative), Philip Davies (Conservative) and Simon Fell (Conservative).  The ad hoc, non-partisan alliance arrives at a time when U.K. authorities are cracking down on areas like crypto advertising, with some fearing that the U.K. has lost its financial innovation crown.  Crypto laggard  The U.K. was smart about opening up its world-famous banking center to innovators in the years following the 2008 financial crash and has historically been a leader in financial technology, or “fintech.”  But more recently, Britain has been lagging behind, particularly when it comes to crypto, according to some industry watchers.  Back in 2016, the fintech movement was going strong thanks to the U.K.’s advantageous policies, but that’s arguably no longer true, says Simon Taylor, co-founder of financial consultancy 11:FS. He said there has been little meaningful effort to increase competition or support new products coming to market.  Meanwhile, the U.S. is seeing fintech firms with $100 billion valuations going public, Taylor said, adding that “the global race has started and the U.K. is getting left behind.”  When it comes to crypto, some of the blame for this is being laid at the door of the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).  “I’ve generally been disappointed by the U.K. posture towards fintech and crypto, which strikes a more negative tone,” Taylor told CoinDesk via direct message. “Crypto companies in particular have told me the FCA is overwhelmed with registration requests, but also they’re unable to continue business without the new registration in the U.K.”  Read more: Crypto Firms Are Giving Up UK Regulatory Registration Bids: Report  He pointed to markets like Singapore and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) that have developed sophisticated frameworks and invested in being responsive to the industry while managing risks to consumers.  “The U.K. has focused only on risk, and perhaps missed the big picture,” Taylor said.  An FCA spokesman told CoinDesk via email that the regulator needs to be assured firms’ managers are fit and proper and they have the systems to properly manage financial-crime risk.  “Firms can help us by submitting complete, high-quality applications. If they do not, delays are likely, and firms ultimately won’t meet the bar for registration,” the spokesman said. “Through initiatives like the sandbox, where firms have safely tested blockchain-based services, the FCA has demonstrated high, consistent standards to build trust in innovation.”  For her part, APPG Chair Cameron says she’s also been given a sense that the U.K. has fallen behind in terms of crypto innovation, which she said was “unacceptable.”  “We need to ensure that regulation keeps pace with the rapid advancements in technology,” Cameron said. “We want to see a clear regulatory framework for crypto and digital assets in the U.K. Countries around the world are currently reviewing their approaches to crypto regulation and we want the U.K. to remain competitive as a place for crypto businesses and not lose out to other more favorable regimes overseas.”  Brexit bonus?  Across Europe, there are 27 member states doing their own thing regarding crypto, guided by agencies such as global anti-money laundering (AML) watchdog, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). So, Germany’s BaFIN might be perceived as relatively crypto-friendly, while French regulator AMF may be less so, and so on.  However, a blanket approach is coming out of Brussels, the bureaucratic nerve center of the European Union. The Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework, an all-encompassing attempt to harmonize virtual asset services in the EU, is expected to come into force in the next two years.  We will lose a lot of innovators in the U.K. if this FCA rhetoric continues.  While MiCA has been broadly well-received, the U.K. isn’t forced to implement it, thanks to Brexit – and that’s a good thing, says Ian Taylor, executive director of CryptoUK, and a driving force behind the cross-party governmental group.  As such, the U.K. can continue to follow a piecemeal approach to crypto regulation, with things like AML, advertising and the treatment of stablecoins receiving close, crypto industry-specific attention, Taylor said.  When it comes to the technical detail of regulation around stablecoins, for instance, the U.K. could choose to help foster innovation in areas like decentralized finance (DeFi) by allowing algorithmic stablecoins to exist in a category of their own, like utility tokens, Taylor added.  Returning to the question of the U.K.’s current regulatory climate, Taylor said it’s something of a “Catch 22” since the presence of a trusted and respected regulator like the FCA is one of the reasons firms might choose the U.K. over, say, the UAE. However, the current climate needs to change, he added.  “We will lose a lot of innovators in the U.K. if this FCA rhetoric continues,” Taylor said in an interview. “Right now the word on the street is don’t set up in the U.K., because you’re never going to get through the regime. And that’s a key piece of education that we’ve got to bring to Parliament.”",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/01/21/the-uk-lawmakers-who-want-to-use-brexit-to-rethink-crypto-rules,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0ab2d7be65490d464cba160f0feb84d2c5bce8b2-4788x3194.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The company said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that it has executed a binding connection agreement with utility provider AEP Texas.  Iris Energy paid $19 million for the security deposit and the connection fee, the filing said. The data centers in Texas are expected to be energized in the first quarter of 2023, the miner said.  Iris Energy has secured a 300 acre freehold site in the Texas Panhandle, the state's northernmost region, which will be connected directly to the grid through a 345-kilovolt transmission line, the filing said.  Iris Energy recorded a hashrate of 748 petahash per second (PH/s) in December 2021. It plans to add 2.9 exahash per second (EH/s) across two sites in British Columbia, with mining rigs it has already secured, by the end of 2022. Another 11.6 EH/s are planned for 2023, including 10.6 EH/s in the Panhandle facility.  The company could add another 7 EH/s in the Texas facility if it secures more mining rigs, bringing its total computing power to 22 EH/s - almost 14% of the bitcoin network's current hashrate.

42423850,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2hNFh,1642764454,"Is Tornado Cash Complicit in Laundering  Crypto? It’s Complicated, Says Former DEA Agent","In many ways, Crypto.com’s hack is now case closed. Technical details of the hack were released (the amount stolen was updated to $33 million) Thursday in a postmortem, and the 483 users who had their funds stolen were reimbursed by the exchange.  But at the center of the episode is Tornado Cash, a mixing protocol that obscures details of transactions on a blockchain in order to throw off investigators. Mixers, also known as tumblers, aren’t new; they’ve been around almost as long as blockchain technology itself. Almost universally, the fate of mixers has been the same – shutdown and arrests.  In the case of the darknet bitcoin mixing service Helix, former U.S. Assistant Attorney General Brian Benczkowski wrote in a press statement announcing the service’s shutdown and arrest of operator Larry Dean Harmon: “This indictment underscores that seeking to obscure virtual currency transactions in this way is a crime.”  At the time, many thought this was a troubling precedent for mixers and the technology behind them, although it should be noted that Harmon pleaded guilty and so the prosecution never had to prove its case that Harmon was laundering money.  “Is Tornado Cash laundering money? They are certainly obfuscating it. But I’d be careful with the term money laundering,” Bill Callahan, a retired Drug Enforcement Agency agent and now director of government affairs at the Blockchain Intelligence Group, told CoinDesk.  Money laundering requires three things: placement, layering and integration, Callahan said. As the crypto is already in the system, Callahan doesn’t think it would necessarily meet the traditional definition of money laundering.  “Pretend I’m running away from police with a bag of cash and jumping over fences, trying to evade capture … that’s not money laundering,” he said. “If Tornado Cash knows who deposited the money and who took it out, that’s not money laundering.”  Self-executing code is mixing crypto  Another key difference between Tornado Cash and prior mixers is that Tornado Cash is autonomous, decentralized permissionless code similar to decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.  Just like how Terraform Labs might argue that it’s not liable for violating securities laws because it doesn’t sell securities – it only creates open-source, decentralized software that allows others to do the issuance – Tornado Cash’s founders might argue that they aren’t liable because they just built the protocol and aren’t hosting it. Self-executing code, once it has been released is just that: something autonomous and beyond the control of its creator.  Roman Semenov, Tornado Cash’s co-founder, didn't reply to a request for comment.  Terraform Labs’ case is before the courts, and so that argument has yet to be tested. But Callahan personally doesn’t buy it.  “There’s going to be a human creator behind it somewhere that’s held liable. That’s another question,” he said. “Smart contracts are not legal contracts.”  Are Tornado Cash’s compliance tools useful?  For its part, Tornado Cash says it offers compliance tools like a cryptographic note that can prove the provenance of funds.  But Stephen Sargeant, an independent anti-money laundering (AML) consultant currently contracted to crypto exchange Bitfinex, questions its utility.  “The compliance tool that Tornado Cash has doesn’t help law enforcement unless law enforcement is interacting with the person that stole the funds,” he told CoinDesk in an interview. “They make it so that law enforcement can approach a person that has interacted with Tornado Cash, and they can give law enforcement a deep dive into all of their transactions.”  So if law enforcement has users of Tornado Cash in their custody, the tool is useful in the evidentiary process. But if they don’t, it’s not much help.  Sargeant notes that Tornado Cash does comply with the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) list of known crypto wallets tied to specially designated nationals – people who have been sanctioned. If it didn’t do that, OFAC would begin to target mixers, which in turn would get tokens, such as Tornado Cash’s, removed from exchanges, killing its liquidity overnight.  The other red line for mixers, Sargeant said, is getting involved in pilfering cash from ransomware attacks, such as what happened last year with Colonial Pipeline. Touching the proceeds of ransomware attacks is going to be met with the same severity as touching terror financing in the years following 9/11. Any sort of arguments about being decentralized aren’t going to hold up to the fire and fury law enforcement and prosecutors will bring down, he said.  Even though there could be a legitimate use for Tornado Cash in an era of hyper-political divisiveness and de-platforming, Sargeant sees Tornado Cash as suspicious. “I don’t think there are that many privacy-conscious people that can put through $10 billion in volume in such a short period of time,” he said.  Naturally suspicious  As an AML consultant at Bitfinex, Sargeant said that he would definitely question any funds coming in from Tornado Cash and need to see more information about source of funds. Trying to load a large amount of capital moved through Tornado Cash onto an exchange would be the equivalent of walking into a bank with a duffel bag full of cash.  According to Sargeant, there is almost always a connection to Binance and Huobi, two exchanges that are being investigated for playing fast-and-loose with know-your-customer (KYC) rules and known to be home to many nested accounts (Binance has acknowledged it has a nesting problem).  But other exchanges also have the same problem, to a lesser extent, and it would be tough to claim that anyone is deliberately profiting from illicit activity – even the Tornado Cash token itself – as around 3% of all crypto volume comes from illicit activities.  “It’s tough to say they are making a profit from illicit activity. … Every service provider has a certain amount of illicit activity,” Sargeant said.  Tornado Cash's token is down 9% so far today at $27.64, according to CoinGecko.  CORRECTION (Jan. 24, 8:45 UTC) Corrects spelling of Sargeant's last name.  CLARIFICATION (Jan. 24, 8:45 UTC) Sargeant would like to emphasize that he is an independent consultant contracted to Bitfinex and is not speaking on behalf of his client.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | LUNA | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/01/21/is-tornado-cash-complicit-in-laundering-stolen-crypto-its-complicated-says-former-law-enforcement-agent,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/49d6569cfa9a821f62d981e55b0767e94dc28f86-2121x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42410925,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggtSOJ,1642763378,"Andrew Rogozov, Former Exec at VK, the 'Facebook of Russia,' Joins Telegram’s Spin-Off Blockchain Project","Toncoin, the offspring of the blockchain project designed by messaging service Telegram, just brought in reinforcements from the mainstream tech world – specifically, from Russian internet giant VK.  Andrew Rogozov, a vice president at VK, the parent company of “Facebook of Russia,” is joining the TON Foundation, a group of people and companies supporting the fledgling Toncoin blockchain, which was earlier known as Newton.  Rogozov plans to help Toncoin grow into a crypto project adopted by Telegram’s more than 500 million monthly users. He will move to an adviser role at VK, he told CoinDesk in an exclusive interview.  VK said in a statement that Rogozov “contributed significantly to the company over the years he’s been working here,” but that starting in the second quarter, he will focus on other projects, while advising VK CEO Vladimir Kirienko on key management priorities, strategic planning and social networks development.  Rogozov is also bringing “several people” with him, he said, although he declined to name them or say if they are coming from VK or other companies.  Toncoin, a blockchain project using code that was created several years ago by Telegram is on its way to becoming fully integrated into the messaging app, Rogozov said.  “We are now in talks with the Telegram team as well as the teams of developers working on various projects” based on the Toncoin blockchain, he said.  Telegram is on board with the plan, Rogozov said. Toncoin is already available to the messaging system’s users through two in-app bots: one that facilitates donations of Toncoin’s namesake tokens to content creators and a wallet bot providing in-app purchases of the token through the crypto trading firm Neocrypto.  Telegram didn't immediately comment.  Big plans  A number of other projects using the Toncoin blockchain are in the works and might soon become available to Telegram users, Rogozov said. “My role is to help with proper communication between the teams and to make things happen,” he said.  In Rogozov’s view, Telegram is not just a messaging app: It’s a major content platform because its many channels function as media outlets. That means the current boom in content creation will benefit it and boost the development of crypto tools aimed at rewarding those creators – including Toncoin’s donation bot, Rogozov said.  Integration with Telegram will give Toncoin an advantage no other blockchain has, Rogozov said.  “I see potential for this for the next 10 years and want it to last long. I’m interested to be in the center of this movement,” he said.  Last year, Rogozov co-founded Tonkeeper, a non-custodial wallet for Toncoin launched in the fall, he said.  Crypto veteran  In December, Telegram CEO Pavel Durov publicly endorsed Toncoin as a project continuing the work his team had to abandon in 2020. Telegram planned to launch TON, an ambitious blockchain with a native crypto token, in 2019, but shelved the plan after a legal fight with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over the status of the project’s token.  A community of developers who had been developing tools for the TON blockchain ecosystem and who participated in Telegram’s hackathons subsequently picked up the code, a move that led to the development of two separate projects based on the same technology and ideas: Free TON (later rebranded as Everscale) and Newton (later rebranded as Toncoin).  Rogozov is, in a sense, a crypto veteran. He bought his first bitcoin in 2014. Since 2007, he has been working at VK.com, Durov’s first company and a popular Russian social network, which Durov later exited not without a drama. Durov started working on Telegram messenger when he was still in VK.com. Rogozov was part of that, too, he said.  After Durov quit to build Telegram, Rogozov took over the CEO role at VK.com and later became a vice president for social platforms in Mail.ru, the company that acquired it.

Blockwall Digital, Fenbushi Capital, FinTech Collective and Reciprocal Ventures also participated in the round, which was announced Thursday.  A large amount of connective tissue is needed to make the blockchain-based next generation of the internet, known as Web 3, function properly. The Graph is a protocol for indexing and querying blockchain data using open-source APIs, called subgraphs, that let developers easily access that data.

The Graph supports indexing data from 26 different blockchain networks, including Ethereum, Near, Arbitrium, Optimism, Polygon, Avalanche, Celo, Fantom, Moonbeam and IPFS. So far, its subgraphs are used by Uniswap, Synthetix, KnownOrigin, Gnosis, Balancer, Livepeer, DAOstack, Audius and Decentraland, according to a press release.  “We expect to see an exponential increase in the data being stored on blockchains, especially given the pace at which the trillion dollar market has been growing over the past year,"" John Curtius, a partner at Tiger Global, said in the statement.

42423854,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2hNJh,1642757088,India's Crypto Industry Awaits New Budget,"India’s cryptocurrency ecosystem is eagerly hoping for a hint of regulation from the government on Feb. 1.  Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the nation’s budget at the beginning of the month during what is considered to be the most important financial day of the year for the world’s largest democracy.  The speech sets the financial tone for the year, as it indicates how government resources will be allocated and how taxes will be regulated. It also addresses which welfare policies will be introduced and which sector will be aided to boost growth, and most importantly, it reflects the government’s balance sheet and therefore tells the state of the economy.  It is possible that cryptocurrency policy gets a mention or more. It is equally possible that the government avoids revealing any new policy or even mentioning crypto.  “Cryptocurrencies don’t give votes,” said one policy expert, who requested anonymity because the individual works closely with the national government. The individual suggested the speech would be populist in nature, geared toward making goods and services cheaper to appease voters ahead of this year’s elections.  “The budget speech is roughly two hours. There are a lot of things to be said. Five states are going to elections. This might not be a priority,” the policy expert said.  Voting in the five Indian states starts nine days after the budget speech. That includes voting in Uttar Pradesh, the most-populous state and therefore the most important for the national government.  In the highly unlikely scenario Sitharaman does reveal fresh crypto policy, the proposed rules would need to be passed by parliament. Therefore, it is still unlikely the crypto-sphere will see any immediate regulation implemented.  What have past budgets said  India’s finance minister has mentioned crypto and blockchain in the past on multiple occasions.  On No. 30, Sitharaman told Parliament that “a new [cryptocurrencies] bill is in the works,” warning that “the risk of cryptocurrency and it going in the wrong hands is being monitored.”  She didn't know how much tax had been collected on cryptocurrency transactions at the time.  Over the past several years, mentions of cryptocurrencies in the budget speech have declined.  In the past, language in the budget speech has gone from stating, “The government does not consider cryptocurrencies legal tender or coin and will take all measures to eliminate use of these crypto assets in financing illegitimate activities or as part of the payment system” and “the government will explore use of block chain technology proactively for ushering in digital economy” in 2018 to no mention in 2019, 2020 or 2021.  “You can never guess what the government will say in the budget speech,” said Subhash Garg, former secretary in the Finance Ministry’s Department of Economic Affairs, and the man at the helm of the government’s first report to propose actions concerning cryptocurrencies.  That report had recommended a ban and suggested creating a digital rupee. Since his retirement, Garg’s stance has changed in favor of regulating crypto.  “It is likely to get a mention. But the government may avoid it altogether too. Why enter into a controversy unless there is clarity on how to deal with cryptocurrencies? So far, the government has not made clear how it plans to deal with cryptocurrencies,” Garg said.  A mention of cryptocurrency could be seen as legitimizing the unregulated sector, according to at least two policy experts who have worked closely with the government.  Representatives of crypto exchanges have been speaking to the media on TV about their wishes.  Edul Patel, CEO of Mudrex, a crypto asset management platform, said he expects some sort of crypto mention during the speech.  “We expect a mention that will be directional in nature, not instructional. We don’t expect any reasonably large changes. Purely because the government is taking its time to figure out what’s happening, which is a great thing, avoiding knee-jerk reactions,” Patel said.  Coming Off Strong Year  Sumit Gupta, co-founder and CEO at CoinDCX, one of the largest exchanges in India, said the crypto situation has changed as last year was a great one for the sector, and therefore a mention of cryptocurrencies is possible.  “There has been a lot of new activity, trading, investors and the government has also taken part in discussions. It is now too big to be ignored,” Gupta said .  If Sitharaman does address cryptocurrencies, exchanges appear to have some common demands.  The first is that the government classify cryptocurrencies. Most crypto-related companies want crypto to be classified as an asset, not a currency. That seems likely, because a measure has replaced the word ""cryptocurrency"" with the term ""crypto asset.""  “While the legal implementation still seems a while away, any initiative announced in the budget would at least open a direct line of conversation on crypto classification as an asset class,” said Nischal Shetty, co-founder and CEO of WazirX, India’s largest crypto exchange.  Mudrex’s Patel said he hoped the budget would “categorize cryptocurrency but not necessarily as an asset.”  He said he believes treating cryptocurrencies as assets would be “fundamentally wrong.”  “It doesn’t necessarily have properties of an asset, things that you can hold, that don’t act as a store of value. Most exchanges are trying to define cryptocurrencies as a security and get it under the mandate of SEBI (the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the country's market regulator). Even if that has its own complications,” Patel said.  CoinDCX’s Gupta felt the “15 to 20 million unique crypto investors cannot be ignored and the market is now a very strong revenue channel for the country.”  Taxing Crypto  According to Gupta, policy discussions suggest classifying cryptocurrencies is “headed in the direction of crypto assets.” That classification goes hand in hand with clarity on taxation.  “For example if it is a commercial transaction then appropriate GST (good and service tax) guidelines can be levied. If it is an investment, capital gains tax can be levied. If someone is trading crypto very actively, then they can file for taxes as a business. And if at all, a foreign transaction is involved it should be reported to RBI (the Reserve Bank of India, the central bank) under FEMA (Foreign Exchange Management Act) regulations,” Gupta told CoinDesk.  Such a granular classification is not technologically possible and cannot be implemented, according to Gaurav Mehta, founder of Catax, a one-stop-shop for crypto taxes, blockchain auditing and forensics.  “It is impossible to keep track of use cases, it is possible to assign an INR (Indian rupee) value to crypto transactions and so satisfy tax compliance requirements,” Mehta said.  In his view, cryptocurrency purchases, sales and trades could be regulated at the exchange level, with compliance requirements enforced on trading platforms.  Recently, as many as five exchanges were “inspected” by tax agencies that visited their offices, paying taxes including, in some cases, penalties, for a total of over 700 million rupees, CoinDesk reported.  According to Mehta, the government may not mention cryptocurrency, but it is likely to reinforce the idea that any income derived from the mobilization of capital would be subjected to the capital gains tax.  Self-Regulation  The lowest-hanging fruit is a demand for giving a thumbs up to certain best practices employed by the crypto exchanges themselves as self-regulation or their own code of conduct as they await government regulation.  This includes licensing requirements such as having know-your-customer (KYC) rules, to satisfy anti-money laundering and combating financing of terrorism (CFT) obligations, establishing defined paths for money entry and exit points, auditing custodians and allowing self-custody.  The exchanges, though, think it is unlikely the government will touch upon or elaborate on its licensing position in this budget.  “We follow strict regulatory practices to ensure customer protection. We hope the budget will help standardize best practices,” said Sharan Nair, chief business officer at crypto exchange CoinSwitch Kuber.  Understanding what best practices require includes spelling out specifics.  “Virtual asset service providers can be accountable for enhanced customer due diligence (CDD), transaction monitoring and record-keeping, as well as obligations to report suspicious transactions for higher threshold amounts, similar to traditional finance institutions,” said Shivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin.  Virtual asset service providers (VASPs) may include cryptocurrency exchanges, digital wallet providers and banks that support crypto asset transactions.  Several in the crypto industry feel it is too early for the government to give a thumbs up to these best practices.  Meanwhile, some say that “the seamless experience is missing” for customers.  “It is important to clearly define how people can move into crypto and out of it. A lot of banks don’t prefer to work with crypto companies. They can’t because there might be repercussions,” Mudrex’s Patel said.  CoinDCX’s Gupta thinks reporting requirements should be addressed before licensing, but he doesn’t see the upcoming budget touching that issue.  Several in the industry questioned the disproportionate attention given to taxing, trading or investing cryptocurrencies. They seek acknowledgement of the Web 3 sector to help India’s blockchain industry keep pace with the rest of the world. In other words, give the crypto industry clarity on how the tokenization business will work in India.  “Government should clarify what is the status of tokens that powers the emerging Web 3 ecosystem,'' Catax’s Mehta said.  “Crypto technology and blockchain are long-term phenomena that are not going away,” said Pratik Gauri, co-founder and CEO of 5ire, a blockchain-based computer network.  The budget can “find ways to provide a groundswell in adoption of blockchain technology in the meat and bones of the largest democracy in the world,” Gauri said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Amitoj Singh,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/01/21/indias-crypto-industry-has-great-expectations-from-the-new-budget,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b62229f6359be58d71210052ea7a0295edc164ac-4000x2667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In an interview with Bloomberg, PlayStation creator Ken Kutaragi called the metaverse “isolating” and VR headsets “annoying”.  “Being in the real world is very important, but the metaverse is about making quasi-real in the virtual world, and I can’t see the point of doing it,” he said in an interview with Bloomberg. “You would rather be a polished avatar instead of your real self? That’s essentially no different from anonymous message board sites.”  Sony has struggled with VR headset sales, selling around 5 million headsets, or an attachment rate of around 4% to the PlayStation 4 since the launch of the PSVR in 2017 suggesting that console gamers are lukewarm to the idea of VR.  “Headsets would isolate you from the real world, and I can’t agree with that,” Kutaragi said. “Headsets are simply annoying.”  At the Consumer Electronics Show in January, Sony announced that a VR headset for the PS5 is in the works. On the other hand, Microsoft has said that “VR for console is not a focus for us at this time,” dismissing the idea of a VR headset for the Xbox.  John Carmack, the creator of Doom and CTO of VR headset maker Oculus (which was purchased by Meta, then Facebook, in 2014), is also a skeptic of the current iteration of the metaverse.  ""I have pretty good reasons to believe that setting out to build the metaverse is not actually the best way to wind up with the metaverse,"" he said in an October keynote, adding that he doesn’t believe there will be a totally open crypto economy in Meta’s version of it.  In a recent note, technology research house IDC said that while the metaverse concept will have real-world technology implications today’s hype is “overblown” and everything is still years away.

42423840,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2hMzh,1642755452,"Ether, Altcoins Tank, With Bitcoin as Decoupling Narrative Goes Up in Smoke","The developing narrative of ether and alternative cryptocurrencies, or altcoins, decoupling from bitcoin in an adverse macro environment went up in smoke on Friday as a sell-off in stocks and the largest cryptocurrency caused extensive damage to the broader crypto market.  Bitcoin fell to a five-month low of $38,300 during the Asian hours, an 8% slide on a 24-hour basis.  Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, tanked 10%, printing lows near $2,800. The convincing move under $3,000 saw some traders book bearish option strategies, Swiss-based derivatives analytics platform Laevitas said.  While Binance token (BNB) slipped 10%, native tokens of Looping, Yearn Finance, Compound and Aave fell between 12% and 15%, CoinDesk data shows. Recent outperformers such as Fantom's FTM and Cosmos' ATOM dropped 10% and 5%, respectively.  All crypto market sectors, including gaming and metaverse, traded in the red and suffered more significant losses than bitcoin.  ""It appears as though the whole market is simply correlated to equities now,"" Laevitas said. ""So it will be interesting to see how that evolves with the [U.S.] Federal Reserve looking increasingly likely to raise rates faster.""  The price action perhaps indicates that the market value of cryptocurrencies promising sound money and democratized finance is heavily dependent on centralized liquidity – the Fed's money printing program.  Ether and the broader crypto market had stayed relatively resilient following bitcoin's early December crash to a then-two-month low of $42,000. That had several observers predicting a continued ether outperformance heading into 2022.  Equities play spoilsport  Bitcoin began losing ground overnight after the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 and the S&P 500 erased early gains and ended Thursday with losses of more than 1%.  ""Currently, the S&P 500 seems to dictate the direction of bitcoin and the overall crypto market, evident by correlations reaching new highs. Bitcoin's 90-day correlation to the S&P 500 is currently at its highest since October 2020,"" according to Arcane Research's weekly note, published Tuesday.  According to Kaiko Research, bitcoin's 30-day correlation with the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 has risen to 17-month highs in the wake of the Fed funds futures pricing in four Fed rate increases for 2022.  ""We're now expecting FIVE Fed rate hikes this year,"" David Belle, founder of Macrodesiac.com and U.K. growth director at TradingView, told CoinDesk in a WhatsApp chat. Earlier this week, Anna Wong, the chief U.S. economist for Bloomberg Economics, said a 50 basis-point Fed increase is warranted at the March meeting.  Even ether, which is more associated with decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFT) than with the inflation trade, seems to be tracking equities. According to blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock, ether's 30-day correlation with Nasdaq has strengthened to 0.86.  More pain ahead?  The key to sustainable bitcoin price recovery is renewed institutional participation, which remains elusive.  ""The awaited institutional inflows have still not returned, and with that $40,000 BTC support broken, the wider market has been pushed lower,"" Laurent Kssis, a crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) expert and director of CEC Capital, said.  Kssis added that the short-term perspective looks bleak, with the futures market data showing potential for more liquidation of longs – the forced closure of bullish positions due to margin shortage – which, in turn, leads to a deeper decline.  ""There are still $100 million worth of longs open, half of which is on BitMEX exchange, which I had not seen for a while,"" Kssis said. ""Since BTC dropped overnight, these long positions on leverage are margin-called, and it's only a question of time.""  Traders will be keenly watching bitcoin's UTC close on Friday, as potential failure to rise back above $40,000 may invite more chart-driven selling. ""The loss of the $40,000 mark today will likely lead to more bearish sentiment, which in turn could push the price further down – it could even test last July's low of $30,000,"" Robbie Liu, a researcher at crypto financial services provider Babel Finance, said in an email.  ""In addition, as we near the Lunar New Year, Chinese investors' demand to cash out is also putting the market under greater selling pressure,"" Liu added. China's week-long Lunar New Year holiday begins on Jan. 31.

According to a Financial Times report, the social media giant behind Facebook and Instagram is currently working on prototypes that will allow users to mint collectible tokens. Additional plans include launching a marketplace that allows the buying and selling of NFTs. However, the report did not specify which blockchain network Meta would use for the marketplace. It should be noted that Meta&apos;s NFT efforts are still in their infancy phase, meaning that the mentioned features are unlikely to launch anytime soon. Should it go into fruition, Meta&apos;s reported foray into NFTs could be a major catalyst for mass adoption and help popularize the use of the burgeoning digital assets industry. Just recently, leading NFT marketplace Opensea surpassed $3.5 billion in monthly transaction volume, indicating that over $169 million are being spent each day in NFT trading just within the platform. So far, the NFT market has had a total of $25 billion in all-time sales. In December, Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri hinted that the company was &apos;actively exploring NFTs,&apos; but provided no further details.

Acumen, a Solana-based lending and borrowing platform, will provide U.S. dollar funding to El Salvador's National Commission for Micro and Small Enterprises (Conamype), a government entity that plans to allocate financing to local informal entrepreneurs and self-employed workers, Conamype's president, Paul Steiner, told CoinDesk.  Acumen's loans will have an annual interest rate of 6% to 7%, although it could reach up to 10%, Acumen's project manager, Andrea Gómez, told CoinDesk.  According to Steiner, 86% of the companies in El Salvador operate in the informal sector and do not have access to banking services. Of that percentage, 98% rely on unregistered lenders offering loans at annual interest rates of 2,300%, on average, he added.  ""They are loan sharks charging between 20% and 25% per month. That is what we want to avoid,"" Steiner said.  According to Steiner, the government has been in talks with Acumen since October 2021, following the approval of bitcoin as legal tender in the Central American country. In parallel, it holds negotiations with different crypto lending platforms looking to provide loans to Salvadoran SMEs, Steiner said, adding that, if signed, the agreements could total $200 million.

In 2021, cryptocurrency investors had another roller-coaster journey. Almost every cryptocurrency, from Bitcoin to Dogecoin, hit new highs and saw massive gains. However, in May, about half of the market&apos;s worth was wiped off in just seven days. In September, China&apos;s crackdown against cryptocurrency grew to include a blanket ban on all transactions. Other notable crypto events in 2021 included El Salvador&apos;s adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender, the explosion of meme tokens, and the sale of an NFT for $69 million. 2021 has been a year marked by the emergence of the first major crypto company, Coinbase, in April, growing participation from Wall Street banks like Goldman Sachs, and the approval of the first bitcoin exchange-traded fund in the United States. However, recent price volatility and increased regulatory scrutiny have dimmed bitcoin&apos;s prospects. Experts warn that the market may be headed for a correction.

The e-commerce company bought shares of 2TM and made ""a strategic investment"" in Paxos, the company said in a statement on Thursday, without disclosing the investment amount.  The investments reinforce Mercado Libre’s “commitment to the development and use of crypto assets and blockchain technology in the region,” the company said.  Mercado Libre's relationship with Paxos is not new.

Bitcoin is down by nearly 8% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinGecko.  Ether is also down, by nearly 10% and hitting $2,841.  Cryptocurrencies associated with layer 1, or basic, blockchains Solana and Cardano have also been dragged down, posting declines of 9% and 10%, respectively.  ""Crypto markets have been sitting on a critical support level for some time. Macro market weakness is causing a sell-off in risk assets. Further continuation of this sentiment will likely see BTC trade in the mid $30s,"" Stack Funds said in a comment to CoinDesk.  According to CoinGlass, there have been nearly $600 million in liquidations during the last 12 hours. Bitcoin led the liquidation pack at $250 million, followed by ether at $163 million and SOL at $10.9 million.  Binance led the exchanges with liquidations at $173 million, with 91% being long positions. Asia-focused exchange OKEx was next at $170 million, with the majority of positions being longs.  The largest single liquidation order happened on Bitmex in the USDT-bitcoin perpetual swap, and was valued at $9.91 million.  In its daily research note, Delphi Digital wrote that investors are pricing in numerous interest rate hikes, which is significantly impacting risk assets.  ""Talk of the town this week is the latest jump in bond yields, most notably U.S. Treasurys, as investors continue to position for an accelerated tightening timeline. The market is now pricing in at least [four] rate hikes this year, with the probability of a [fifth] ticking up this week. While a lot of headlines have focused on nominal yields, it’s the recent spike in real yields that matters more in our opinion, especially for non-income-producing assets like bitcoin and gold,"" they wrote.  In a note to CoinDesk, Huobi's director of research, Li Hui, told CoinDesk, ""Market sentiment is pessimistic, and investors are in a wait-and-see mood."" The ""decline was very fluid and there was no significant rebound after the support price was broken.""  This move appears to have caught the market by surprise, as options chain data suggests there is a significant amount of open interest stuck at $45,000-$46,000 for bitcoin and $3,200-$3,300 for ether, according to Laevitas.  Tony Ling, a partner at China-based Bizantine Capital wrote in a note to CoinDesk that investors in China appear to be continuing to cash out given the economic slowdown in the country because of the latest waves of COVID-19, and the upcoming spring festival holiday.

The difficulty is automatically adjusted based the amount of computational power on the network, or hashrate, to keep the time it takes to mine a block roughly stable at 10 minutes. The higher the hashrate, the higher the difficulty, and vice versa.  On May 13, 2021, bitcoin's mining difficulty hit a record 25.04 trillion, as primarily Chinese and North American miners deployed their machines.  The difficulty started dropping later in May when miners in China, at the time the biggest bitcoin mining country, went dark to comply with a regulatory crackdown. Hashrate and difficulty kept falling until late July.  Most miners from China estimated they would come back online in Q1 2022, so ""we can attribute a good bit of this increase [in difficulty] to Chinese miners finally coming online in North America,"" Whit Gibbs, CEO of Compass Mining, told CoinDesk.  As Chinese miners found new homes for their operations, and new facilities came online, the hashrate and difficulty started to increase. By December, the hashrate had almost recovered from its July lows.

""In 2022, we expect record growth of this indicator,"" Roman Zabuga, a PR representative for mining host BitRiver, told CoinDesk.  ""From July 2022 to December 2022, most of the largest miners have enormous deliveries of the Antminer's newest ASIC Antminer S19 XP. These deliveries will make the difficulty soar throughout the whole 2022,"" Mellerud said.

Related Reading | Downward DOGE: Descending Dogecoin Pattern Predicts Deadly Drop The In&apos;s and Outs… Crowdfunding is a practice where you can donate money - including cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, and more cryptocurrencies - to projects, associations or people to develop ideas. It is a very powerful mechanism and tool for innovation and supporting social enterprises. Different platforms, such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo have not taken their foot off the brakes; the web 2.0 crowdfunding movement, which has led to the creation of several billion-dollar tech startups, like Oculus, and raised millions of dollars for thousands of causes, is ripe for development. Crypto crowdfunding has the potential to be a network that connects people and their ideas. Today, crowdfunding is dramatically narrowed by its reliance on legacy finance, which limits the vast majority of the world from accessing it. Although this is good in theory, and has worked thus far, the major issue is the reliance on the legacy financial infrastructure, that is not only costly but globally fragmented.

42423851,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2hNHh,1642724314,Witnesses Debate Crypto Mining's Efficiency in Congressional Hearing on Environment,"While some U.S. lawmakers grappled with the basics of digital assets, key issues about the definition of energy efficiency and how crypto miners are powered were debated on the floor of the House of Representatives during Thursday’s congressional hearing on the crypto industry’s environmental footprint.  Before lawmakers can set policy on cryptocurrency energy consumptions, they need to grasp the fundamentals of digital assets.  This was on full display at the two hours and 15 minutes-long hearing hosted by the Oversight and Investigations subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which was looking at the environmental impact of crypto mining  The hearing featured Cornell Tech Professor Ari Juels, Soluna Computing CEO John Belizaire, BitFury CEO Brian Brooks, former Chelan County (Washington state) Public Utility District General Manager Steven Wright and Jordan Ramis shareholder Gregory Zerzan discussing the energy consumption related to the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus model to validate crypto currency transactions.  “Some experts estimate bitcoin mining uses anywhere from 110 to 188 terawatts (TW) of the world's energy and annually, more energy usage than some small countries,” said Rep. Howard Griffith (R-Va.). “The question is, can our current electrical infrastructure support this level of consumption?”  The first witness was Cornell Tech's Ari Juels, who started by saying that “if my testimony achieves nothing else today, I would like to drive home one key point: bitcoin does not equal blockchain.”  Sustainable energy mix  It's no secret the PoW consensus model, used by the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, bitcoin and ether, requires a massive amount of energy. In fact, some data sources have compared bitcoin’s required energy to an entire country’s power consumption.  Witnesses at the hearing dug deeper into the data and told lawmakers that's not an apples to apples comparison, given the mix of power sources used for validating a transaction.  “An activity that consumes 100 TW of power derived exclusively from coal or oil adds carbon to the environment and consumes a scarce resource; an activity that consumes the same amount of power derived from a mix of solar, wind and hydropower does neither,” said Bitfury's Brooks, the former acting comptroller of the currency.  He provided data that the energy mix used by bitcoin mining was about 58% sustainably sourced last year, which included wind and hydro power, solar, nuclear and carbon offsets, compared to 31% for the U.S. energy grid as a whole.  Juels and Brooks debated the efficiency of crypto mining later in the hearing. Brooks argued that more-efficient machines, which in industry terms usually means they burn less electricity per terahash, means a more efficient network overall.  Juels responded that what actually matters to consumers is the electricity burned per number of transactions processed. Because transactions per second have remained roughly stable at five per second, whereas the network’s energy usage has increased, the Bitcoin network has actually become less efficient in the past few years, Juels said.  Soluna's Belizaire and Zerzan, the Jordan Ramis PC shareholder, said crypto mining actually helps renewable energy producers sell electricity that is otherwise wasted, thus providing them with much-needed capital.  Similarly, towards the end of the hearing Brooks also mentioned that BitFury primarily works with local utility providers “because they can only make the economics work if there is a baseload consumer,” meaning the miners.  Back to basics  The better part of the hearing focused on the basics of blockchain technology, educating the lawmakers on how different validation models such as proof-of-stake (PoS) operate and some of the cybersecurity concerns around blockchain networks, such as 51% attacks (when an attacker controls 51% of a network’s hash power, allowing them to control transactions).  Several lawmakers also asked about unintended positive or negative factors that could stem from bitcoin mining.  Rep. Cathy Rodgers (R-Wash.), who began the hearing with an off-topic speech about inflation, COVID-19 and President Joe Biden, asked about the potential of blockchain to protect citizens’ privacy, as well as the potential adverse impact of regulation on job and investment growth. Rep. Annie Kuster (D-N.H.) inquired about innovations that could stem from bitcoin mining and benefit other industries.  “I think what happened today is, we started the education,” said Soluna’s Belizaire in an interview with CoinDesk, after the hearing.  The hearing began a learning process for some of the most important lawmakers around energy and commerce, he said, which could set the stage to bring in legislation to incentivize the use of more green energy for the industry.  “I thought it was really exciting for an oversight committee like that to really dig in and seek out the truth and really educate themselves,” he said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | REGULATION,"Aoyon Ashraf, Eliza Gkritsi",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/01/21/witnesses-debate-crypto-minings-efficiency-in-congressional-hearing-on-environment,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c8611897a397298e31b0462507f044a0f509a874-4000x2667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
