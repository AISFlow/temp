42425081,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHqw5h,1382994286,Bitmit is still the eBay of bitcoin despite setbacks,"You might have heard of Bitmit before. One of the bitcoin community's favorite legal trading posts has been online for over two years, and despite its share of uncertainty it still appears to be going strong.  Imagine an eBay that took payments exclusively in bitcoin, or a clean version of the Silk Road, and you can picture Bitmit. The Hong Kong-based marketplace even has a colorful eBay-esque logo to help newcomers feel at home.  Sellers may list their items in BTC or their preferred local currency, which is then converted to BTC at checkout. The system also lists price equivalents in a buyer's local currency based on their registered shipping address.  There's also the expected rating system, ID verification, options to sell via auction or a 'buy now' price, and a default bitcoin escrow system in which buyers must notify upon receipt of goods for the seller to receive payment.  Bitmit charges a flat fee of 1.9% for each successful sale. Unlike eBay, it does not apply the fee to shipping costs as well.  As of 28 October 2013, Bitmit has almost 14,000 items listed for sale. Perhaps reflecting bitcoin enthusiasts' interests, the most popular categories are PC/video games, computer equipment, and money.  The 'money' category is interesting: as well as containing listings for novelty coins, silver coins and paper currency for collectors, it also functions as another kind of bitcoin exchange, with several listings for cash to be sent through the mail in return for BTC at competitive prices*.  By comparison Coinpost, a site sometimes mentioned as a competitor, had only 18 active listings site-wide on the same day.  Another marketplace, Bitcoinclassifieds, seemed to have activity levels closer to Bitmit's but didn't include category totals.  Bitcoinclassifieds lets sellers list classifieds for free but its listings are in BTC only. A warning appears if a listing gets too old. The site was ""created by Maycam Media to encourage the use of bitcoins, and to create more bitcoin users."" It lists an address on the front page to accept bitcoin donations.  Bitmit almost shuts down and goes on sale  As is the case with most large scale bitcoin-related businesses in the past couple of years, however, there has been some drama.  [post-quote]  In October 2012 a seller announced in the bitcointalk forums that Bitmit was shutting down ""due to upcoming law changes.""  User 'tosaki', Bitmit's mouthpiece on the forum, confirmed the news saying: ""Financial supervision requires special licences for businesses which holds customer funds,"" and ""Sadly this is true. If someone is interested in buying the site feel free to contact us.""  The site itself was then listed for sale on Bitmit. Many users reported displeasure at the news, with reports of mostly positive experiences trading there.  Two days later, though, tosaki posted again saying: ""Good news. We have figured out a solution for this problem. Bitmit is not going to be sold. Business as usual. I am sorry for the insecurity this may have caused.""  No further explanation was provided at the time, other than ""problems in our data center"".  In January 2013, there was speculation Bitmit had actually been sold to a new owner without public announcement.  More recently, the site has experienced several lengthy periods of downtime (it was actually offline at the time of writing this) for 'maintenance'. These may simply be Twitter-like growing pains, as the site always returns and new buyers and sellers appear.  There was once an official Twitter account @BitmitNet, which no longer exists. The Reddit category 'Bitmit' has only six posts and few subscribers, though sellers often link to listings on the BitMarket subreddit.  Despite the uncertainty and occasional hiccups, users I asked for comment on Reddit were generally positive about their Bitmit buying and selling experiences.  ""I've sold a couple hundred digital games on Bitmit, and bought a few items as well. I highly recommend it, for both buyers and sellers. The experience has only improved over time as they add new features, and their support staff was very helpful in the few instances I needed to contact them,"" said Phil_8811.  ""I only have had 3 sales but I love the system. It is easy to communicate with the customers, easy to relist sold items, easy to see order status, etc,"" said abdada.  Exchange rate volatility  The only complaints arose from the volatile nature of bitcoin's exchange rate. Even though Bitmit has been building price security into the system with more regular updates, there will still be losers if the price shifts suddenly one way or the other (as it tends to do).  ""I had an item listed and it sold only during a bitcoin exchange rate mini-crash,"" said user OnlineDegen.  ""At the time, the price of bitcoins crashed, but Bitmit was using the 24-hour average as an exchange rate, so the buyer's coins were highly overvalued at the time of sale. It seems they have since changed the site's exchange rate to use the last trade price, so this is no longer an issue.""  ""I will use Bitmit again when I need to sell something because, as I said, it's much less hassle than selling on eBay.""  The only other repeated quibble about Bitmit is its compulsory escrow system, which means sellers must send goods and wait for buyer confirmation before receiving their funds. Bitmit's administrators appear reluctant to see any stories of fraudulent selling appear online, though, and keep watch over payments to even well-reputed sellers until receipt is confirmed.  In its two-year lifespan Bitmit has been compared both to market Goliath eBay and its evil twin the Silk Road.  The exact nature of its ownership has been questioned but reports of dissatisfied customers remain few. Should it sort out its technical kinks and continue efforts to be trustworthy (and hopefully outgrow its eBay-like branding), Bitmit could be another mainstream way for non-miners to acquire bitcoin. It could also do some heavy lifting in growing and broadening the bitcoin economy.  *Contrary to popular myth, it is not illegal to send cash through the mail, though it is considered risky. Buyers are also advised to review user ratings for sellers before buying, and use the escrow service for sales involving cash-in-the-mail and gift cards.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/10/28/bitmit-is-still-the-ebay-of-bitcoin-despite-setbacks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ca818f768ad22d6ea6555b1f3091b462b607743f-1000x750.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42425089,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHqwLh,1382975138,Coinbase aims to become the Gmail of bitcoin,"Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, is a hard man to track down. It took CoinDesk months to get him on the phone. “Things have been busy!” he said.  No wonder. Armstrong is leading the charge to make bitcoin a mainstream currency. His firm specializes in services that make it easy to use.  Customers in the US can buy bitcoins from Coinbase using credit cards. They can keep them easily in a web-based wallet, an iPhone app, and they can send them to each other via email addresses, without having to worry about QR codes or random alphanumeric gibberish. They can even use SMS if they want. How is it able to do this?  Core developer Jeff Garzik once said that although the underlying protocol for the bitcoin currency had been developed, a second layer of services designed to exploit the coin was still needed.  These services, such as more intuitive payment systems, credit services, stock exchanges, and smart property, are what will give bitcoin more traction among mainstream users who would run a mile from a public bitcoin key.  Coinbase isn’t building most of them – but it is focusing on making a superset of services as simple as possible.  ""We want to make bitcoin easier, and if we can do it with underlying bitcoin technology we will always do it that way first,” he says.  “But if customers ask for something like recurring billing, or subscription payments, or free micro-transactions and we can't think of a way to do it with the underlying protocol, then we are going to provide it on top of the protocol.""  This creates something of a bubble for Coinbase and its customers. When Coinbase users send each other bitcoins between Coinbase wallets, they send money to email addresses, rather than bitcoin addresses. This is one of the ease-of-use features offered by the company.  What exactly does Coinbase do?  Armstrong breaks its services down into three main categories: user wallets, bitcoin buying and selling, and merchant tools.  It has competitors in all three areas (BitPay in the merchant space, for example), but capitalizes on being one of the only companies – if not the only one – to offer an end-to-end ecosystem.  Armstrong describes the company's advances in each of these areas. The off-chain transactions in its user wallet offering nestled alongside paper wallet, and bitcoin rewards for referring other customers.  On the merchant side, it enabled merchants to collect shipping addresses and emails through its merchant tools earlier this month, and has been offering recurring payments since May. Merchants can also accept microtransactions with zero fees.  Isn't it dangerous to take large amounts of bitcoin trades off-chain and offer them non-standard services such as the ability to send to email addresses? By creating a bubble of customers who can transact in a non-standard way, doesn't Coinbase risk Balkanising the bitcoin community?  The ""Gmail"" of the bitcoin world  Armstrong likens his service to Gmail, and bitcoin to SMTP.  SMTP is an open email standard that provides basic functionality, but people using Gmail can do extra, non-standard things, such as having calendar invites automatically dropping to Google calendar, or taking advantage of automatic message prioritization or conversational threading directly in the client.  ""We love open protocols,"" he says. ""And in the same vein we never want to have anyone locked into anything on Coinbase, so if you were to lose faith in us, you didn’t like our services, or we did something evil in the future, you will always be able to send bitcoins outside Coinbase.”  Between 75-80% of transactions that Coinbase conducts are handled internally, says Armstrong, but if it needs overflow capacity, it has partners.  Where it needs to reach out to our exchanges, he has agreements with Tradehill, Bitstamp, and Mt. Gox.  But with Tradehill benched because of regulatory issues, and with Mt. Gox taking a long time to process US withdrawals, Armstrong admits that Bitstamp is his ‘go-to’ exchange at present.  However, the company also conducts over-the-counter trades with two or three institutional players, at least one of which is a miner, he says.  Regulatory uncertainty  The company still faces challenges, however. There is still some regulatory uncertainty, he suggests. The company is exchanging bitcoins for fiat currency on US territory, and it has indeed taken the step of securing an MSB license at the federal level.  However, the individual US states are a different story. Each state has its own regulatory approach (and some appear to have none at all). Some states are considerably more aggressive than others. ""We're in uncharted territory, so hard to say if this stuff falls under a particular state's MTL [money transmitting license] statutes,"" says co-founder Fred Ehrsam. ""We're still talking to states to figure out how each responds, but Coinbase is prepared to get licensed where a regulator deems it's necessary.""  In the meantime, he is continuing to do business, relying on the fact that Coinbase has its AML and KYC processes established.  In short, it seems to be a process of acting first and asking forgiveness later, while doing the utmost to ensure that, should regulators come calling, it will be in a position to show them some documented processes.  ""Our approach so far has been that we assume the industry is going to get there eventually, where it will be pretty clear that you need to do it. That said, there is nothing clear yet today saying that that is the case.”  This approach stands in stark contract to partners like Tradehill, for example, which focuses more on the high-net worth market. It refuses to do business without all of its US state licenses intact, and has backed out of the market while it resolves the issue.  [post-quote]  It is a bold move on Coinbase’s part. Grabbing a market first brings the benefit of time; an early adopter can get a solid grip on a market and establish a healthy cashflow before regulators weigh in.  Square, for example, was fined $507,000 by state regulators in Florida and Illinois for failing to obtain a license before opening up for operations.  However, by that time the firm had raised $341m, and the Florida fine (which enabled it to then obtain its license) was presumably at that point just a cost of doing business.  Coinbase has a long way to go down that road. It successfully completed its A-round last May with a $5m investment led by Union Square Ventures.  It was the largest investment in a bitcoin-related company at the time, and it sets the scene for bigger funding deals in the future. It is constantly growing, having just signed a deal with Cashie Commerce, enabling the latter to use its merchant API for BitDazzle, an online Etsy-style marketplace for bitcoin-friendly merchants.  Deals like this will propel the company forward – and bitcoin with it.  If the regulatory challenges do come, the firm must be secretly hoping that it will have raised enough funds to handle them.  In the meantime, it will be concentrating on volume growth, by gaining mindshare in a still-nascent market.  This must be one reason why it waived merchant processing fees for its first $1m in sales. It will also strive to stay focused on what users want, which is likely to keep it one step ahead of the core development team on merchant and wallet features.  Bitcoin startups today must make a landgrab for users. In a market with everything to play for, owning your own ecosystem in a decentralized world like bitcoin is a valuable asset.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/10/28/coinbase-aims-to-become-the-gmail-of-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d2d2b62006bb4c2ed8cc1881ab80e53462e180b6-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425087,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHqwFh,1382963408,Developers attempt to resurrect Namecoin after fundamental flaw discovered,"Namecoin, the basis of a decentralised domain name system (DNS), has been found to have a fundamental flaw which allows any .bit domain to be taken over ... by anyone.  There are over 103,000 .bit domains, and while evidence suggests none of them have been maliciously taken over, the protocol that governs those domains cannot be trusted until fixed.  While Namecoin was a coin that could be traded like any other cryptocurrency, it had a much nobler function in life than being a mere commodity to trade and spend.  The raison d'etre of Namecoin was to provide a decentralised and cryptographically strong way of storing and transmitting pairs of keys and values.  Its application was an alternative domain name system DNS that could not be controlled by any government or corporate organisation – the first (and so far only) top level domain (TLD) of which was .bit. For more information, see our full explanation of Namecoin.  The notion of a DNS system that no one party could control had serious implications for those with a need to publish information that would otherwise be suppressed or censored.  For example, Wikileaks has a .bit domain too – wikileaks.bit. For most people, that link wouldn't work, precisely because the .bit TLD is separate to the DNS network that millions of people use every day. To browse .bit websites, users would have to install browser extensions that could handle this alternative naming system.  So there we have established the importance of Namecoin. However, it is a cryptocurrency that can be traded for other currencies too – which is why its fatal flaw was eventually discovered by a cryptoexchange developer.  Michael Gronager is the chief operating officer for Payward Inc, the company behind the Kraken exchange. Gronager also goes by the name of ""libcoin"" on the Bitcoin Talk forum, so named for the function library, used by Kraken, that he develops.  Gronager told us: ""At Kraken, we give all assets we include thorough scrutiny – we don't want to trade in an asset where its value could disappear overnight. So it was in the process of checking Namecoin and enabling libcoin to also support Namecoin that I found the issues.""  The two issues that Gronager discovered surrounded the enforcement of rules that should have protected the integrity of the protocol.  The first problem encountered was that the name reservation system that is used in the process of registering a new domain could easily be overridden.  The biggest problem that Gronager discovered, though, was that anyone can take ownership of any .bit domain. This means that, as Gronager put it to us: ""The protocol as originally envisioned is dead, stone dead.""  He added: ""That was based on only allowing value updates if the transaction input name matched the transaction output name, which is no longer the case and still can be exploited. Further, you cannot vacuum this away from the block chain again.""  For people who have already purchased .bit domains with Namecoin (which is the only way to purchase .bit domains), Gronager assured us that existing domains are safe – everything up to Namecoin block 139,872 to be precise.  He claims this based on having written his own implementation of Namecoin which is currently monitoring the integrity of the Namecoin block chain: ""The libcoin implementation of Namecoin can monitor the Namecoin block chain and check rule inconsistencies, so I know for sure that it has never been exploited before.""  As for how to move forward, given that there are currently over 103,000 .bit domains, Gronager remains optimistic. He suggested a way forward for Namecoin:    ""You can base the consistency of the names on the first name reservation and then a cryptographically unbroken chain of transactions. So basically, the names in the name transaction becomes superfluous, except for the first name reservation. This is the new kind of check needed. I have added this to libcoin, which was easy as libcoin stores all its state in a relational database.      Namecoin, like the Bitcoin Satoshi client, uses a key-value database (BerkeleyDB) so it is a bit harder to patch, I have however sketched a full patch for the namecoin devs and they are working on it. Of course, one could restart Namecoin with rules properly enforced from the start, but I think the patch mentioned above is a more viable solution.""    He went on to add, ""I still believe in Namecoin, and we at Kraken still plan to introduce it as one of our assets, but we need to see the patch first, however, once a proper patch is there, we are ready to trade.""  While the area of cryptoexchanges has been a regulatory minefield, when I spoke to Kraken's CEO Jesse Powell, earlier this year, he made a point of explaining how compliance was at the top of his priorities for Kraken.  Gronager added to this: ""Kraken aims at full legal compliance, and we try to keep a high business ethic, so disclosing information about bugs is critical information that will affect the rate, further, it is not ideal as an exchange to have such information about an asset once you start trading - risking accusations of not leaking it in a fair way for all.""  The state of the Namecoin fix was echoed by Gronager on the forum thread: ""Current status is - don't buy a domain from someone, and don't trust any important key-value pair in Namecoin before the fix has been rolled out! - Will update once it is there, but could take days to deploy at miners.""  Ultimately, it looks as if Namecoin will be brought back from the dead, with several patches being tested by the development team. But until it is ready, the cryptocurrency that backs the world's alternative DNS system has to be regarded as being in quarantine.  We can be sure that Gronager et al will be keeping an eye on the integrity of the existing Namecoin block chain. Clearly it's a setback, but it seems as if the cryptocurrency that might help to preserve freedom of speech will pull through after some work from dedicated developers.",NEGATIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY,David Gilson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/10/28/developers-attempt-to-resurrect-namecoin-after-fundamental-flaw-discovered,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7b265a4dce4ce03ea5956ff54e512af098896ecb-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425094,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHqwPh,1382955268,First Australian photography studio to accept bitcoin offers 50% discount,"Looking for photography services in Australia? Customers willing to pay via bitcoin to Seagull Photography in Waitara, New South Wales, which is just outside of Sydney, can get a bargain.  Anyone in need of a photographer that pays 1 BTC to the studio will receive an AU$400 voucher. Based on the current bitcoin price in Australian dollars, that's a 50% discount for using bitcoin.  And it is cumbersome Australian banking processes that influenced Seagull's decision to promote bitcoin, says Mohammad Soltani, who helps his wife Azam Vahabzadeh with the technical side of the photography studio.  ""It takes one full business day to receive the payment from another bank which is effectively three calendar days if the payment is done on Friday. As a business we think that this is not acceptable,"" Soltani told CoinDesk.  In Australia, people use bank transfers to make payments. And moving money from one bank to another is what causes this delay, Soltani says. ""Eighty percent of our customers transferred from a different bank which took a day or more"".  ""As a photography business, we were ready to accept bitcoin but we were not sure if any of the clients will be interested in paying by bitcoin, so we just decided to do this promotion and find out,"" says Soltani.  Since photography by its nature is not structured with a high volume of people coming through the door, Soltani thinks that similar businesses should try accepting bitcoin.  ""My advice is to add bitcoin to the list of your acceptable payment methods. Photography businesses are not like a retail store and don't deal with lots of customers. So it's easy to handle the overhead caused by accepting new payment methods,"" he said.  There are other incentive-based concepts being tried by businesses to encourage bitcoin spending. Coinbase, for example, has a program whereby if a bitcoin enthusiast sends a new user 1 BTC and they end up buying or selling at least one bitcoin, each gets $5.  Although he believes in its potential, Soltani isn't sure that Australians are fully convinced bitcoin will take off yet.  ""From what I have seen, only about 20% become believers and are ready to bet on the future of bitcoin, and the rest think that some day the US government will intervene and ban bitcoin, so they see it as too risky at this stage,"" he said.  Still he sees this effort as a way to legitimize the decentralized virtual currency.  ""We just hope that this little drop will make some ripples and will spread to other Aussie businesses.""  Here are the complete details of Seagull Photography's bitcoin offer.  What do you think about giving special incentives for customers paying in bitcoin?
