42412231,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl3P30,1645224596,Fraudulent Bitcoin Transfer Alleged in Cred Bankruptcy,"UPDATE (Aug. 31, 2024, 23:00 UTC): Updates throughout with comments from Winslow Carter Strong and new information.  When crypto lending platform Cred filed for bankruptcy in November 2020 with up to $500 million in liabilities, the company primarily blamed alleged fraud by an outside investment manager entrusted with 800 BTC.  Former employees also said the company was hurt by the souring of a $39 million line of credit that Cred extended to a Chinese lender at the behest of CEO Dan Schatt.  But court documents filed in February 2022 by the trust representing Cred‚Äôs debtors alleged there was also a fraudulent transaction in which Cred paid consultant and ‚Äúcrypto whale‚Äù Winslow Carter Strong over 516 bitcoin (worth about $4.8 million at the time of sale and $21 million today) in exchange for an essentially worthless bond.  ‚ÄúIt is a fundamental tenet of bankruptcy law that an insolvent company cannot transfer assets in exchange for no value. That is exactly what happened here,‚Äù Darren Azman, an attorney at McDermott Will & Emery LLP representing the Cred Liquidation Trust, told CoinDesk in an email. ‚ÄúThe Trust has already traced and recovered a significant amount of cryptocurrency for the benefit of creditors and will continue to be aggressive in those efforts‚Äù‚Äù  Strong, for his part, said he, too, was a victim of Cred's misconduct, and the court eventually dismissed the creditors' fraudulent transfer charges against him.  Cred‚Äôs road to bankruptcy  Cred began life in 2018 as Libra Credit, established in Singapore by Dan Schatt and Lu Hua. Libra Credit became Cyber Quantum, which conducted an initial coin offering (ICO) in May 2018. The proceeds provided the initial funding for the company that, after an organizational move to the United States, would become Cred.  Cred‚Äôs most notable product offering was CredEarn, where customers lent crypto to Cred with the promise of being repaid plus interest in the same type of crypto as the original investment. Cred then loaned the crypto to MoKredit, a Chinese micro-lending platform owned by Cred co-founder Hua. And MoKredit then lent those funds to its own customers, supposedly thousands of gamers who borrowed small amounts at interest rates as high as 35%.  Cred‚Äôs dealings with MoKredit were entirely in stablecoin, but Cred‚Äôs debts to its CredEarn customers were in cryptocurrencies, leaving the company exposed to crypto price increases.  Enter Strong  According to the documents, Strong developed a relationship with Cred in early 2020 as a consultant who would refer wealthy crypto investors to them. Cred execs internally referred to Strong as a ‚Äúcrypto whale‚Äù with deep ties to the high net worth crypto community in Puerto Rico.  Cred also approached Strong to invest with CredEarn, and he soon executed an agreement to loan 500 bitcoin to them at an interest rate of 9%.  However, Cred management also approached Strong with a different opportunity the day before the CredEarn agreement was executed ‚Äì namely, purchasing a bond from Income Opportunities, a Luxembourg company that both Cred and Strong referred to as a ‚Äúbankruptcy remote entity.‚Äù  The February 2022 complaint alleges that Strong ""was well-aware of Cred‚Äôs precarious financial position and ... exposure to MoKredit."" It notes that Cred execs provided him with a confidential brief on MoKredit‚Äôs business model in January 2020. In the plaintiffs' telling, he figured the bonds were a better bet than lending money to CredEarn.  Strong later called ""absurd"" any suggestion that he was trying to avoid exposure to MoKredit. Rather, he said he was concentrating it. The Income Opportunities entity, he pointed out in a 2023 email to CoinDesk, was lending 100% of its assets to MoKredit.  His stated intention from the start, he said, was to roll over the loan to Cred into the Luxembourg entity ""as soon as it was ready to receive it."" Cred had marketed Income Opportunities to Strong as ""better-insulated from bankruptcy (which, ironically, turned out to be the exact opposite for me),"" he told CoinDesk.  Strong wound up purchasing a note from Income Opportunities by transferring the 500 bitcoin he was lending to CredEarn. A few months later, on July 2, 2020, after Cred was already on the road to bankruptcy, it transferred 516 bitcoin to Strong.  The creditors' complaint characterized this transfer as Cred buying the note from Strong. Strong told CoinDesk it was simply a repayment of funds due with interest. The note agreement, reviewed by CoinDesk, gives a maturity date of June 30, 2020. Strong said he got his money back two days late.  In November 2022, Cred filed for bankruptcy, leaving most of its investors in the lurch but having compensated one of its high-profile investors and consultants.  What happened next  In February 2022 the Cred trust said it was investigating Cred‚Äôs consultant payments to Strong and the extent of his involvement with the business practices that led to the bankruptcy. The trust was also seeking information from Strong to help investigate third parties that Strong referred to Cred.  Five months later, the court dismissed two of the five counts against Strong. In February 2023, Strong and the plaintiffs settled the remaining charges. The case was dismissed with prejudice, meaning it can never be reopened.  Strong told CoinDesk he lost more on the settlement and legal fees defending the claim than he made on the loan.

The rules, which were approved in January, outline registration and reporting requirements for virtual asset service providers (VASP) that align with the European Union‚Äôs fifth AML directive and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) guidelines for crypto firms. Their publication in Italy‚Äôs formal journal of record indicates the rules are ready to take effect.  The document specifies what is required of VASPs to be registered in a special roster for crypto firms. According to the document, registration in the roster maintained by is required if firms are to offer any digital-asset related services in the country.  The new rules were published just as lawmakers in the European Union (EU) are getting ready to begin discussions on the proposed regulatory package for crypto assets. The Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) package seeks to set EU-level standards and requirements for cryptocurrency issuers, service providers and users.  Most notably, it is looking to set up a passportable license for crypto firms which would allow companies to easily operate in all EU-member states if they are fully registered and compliant in one EU jurisdiction.  However, Italy‚Äôs new rules include a requirement that doesn‚Äôt quite align with the EU‚Äôs ambitious passportable license for VASPs.  In order to qualify for registration in the special roster for approved VASPs in Italy, all entities must comply with Article 17-bis of a 2008 directive related to credit contracts, the document says.  According to the Article, any VASP from another EU country must have a permanent establishment, or stabile organizzazione, in Italy to be able to register as an approved VASP.  A report on the new rules published by Lexia Avvocati, an independent Italian law firm, interprets stabile organizzazione to mean a branch or subsidiary.  ‚ÄúAccordingly, VASPs that are incorporated in other EU member states will have to set up an Italian branch or subsidiary in order to operate with Italian customers. VASPs established in third countries will have to incorporate an Italian subsidiary,‚Äù the report said.  In addition to the registration requirement, the document says VASPs must report all information required under the AML regulations to the Organismo Agenti e Mediatori (the body responsible for overseeing the VASP roster) at the end of each quarter.

Bitcoin (BTC) was down 2% over the past 24 hours, and briefly dipped below $40,000 for the first time in two weeks. Meanwhile, alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) such as ether (ETH) and solana (SOL) declined as much as 4% over the past 24 hours.  ""Crypto performance in the last week shows us that there‚Äôs very little room for complacency regarding any of the major themes impacting this market,"" David Duong, head of research at Coinbase Institutional, wrote in a Friday newsletter. ""Open conflict could potentially affect bitcoin hashrates, which could exacerbate the knee-jerk market reaction weaker for high-beta risk assets like crypto.""  Earlier this month, Coinbase tweeted that it saw a net inflow into stablecoins (a crypto reserve asset) totaling $3.5 billion between November 2021 and January 2022 as market volatility picked up. That signaled a flight to safety among traders on the Coinbase exchange. Still, the company does not expect a repeat of the 2018 bear market.  For now, technicals are mostly bearish for bitcoin. There are initial signs of downside exhaustion on the BTC daily chart, which suggests the pullback could stabilize between the $30,000-$40,000 support zone.  Latest prices  ‚óèBitcoin (BTC): $40093, ‚àí2.37%    ‚óèEther (ETH): $2797, ‚àí4.16%    ‚óèS&P 500 daily close: $4349, ‚àí0.71%    ‚óèGold: $1898 per troy ounce, ‚àí0.16%    ‚óèTen-year Treasury yield daily close: 1.93%     Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  The recent decline in the 10-year Treasury yield could be a short-term positive for speculative assets such as equities and cryptocurrencies.  ""We remain cyclically bearish on bonds, although yields could soon pause; conditions are becoming technically stretched and U.S. rate expectations have already ratcheted higher,"" MRB Partners wrote in a research note this week. ""However, any pause, like the dip in yields last year, will not mark the end of the cyclical rise in yields.""  Bitcoin's correlation with stocks remains elevated over the short term, which means price jumps could be temporary if macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds continue to linger.  So far this month, bitcoin trading volumes across major spot exchanges remain low relative to prior peaks. An increase in trading activity is expected, especially if sharp price swings occur.

42416679,e264UAkMOkEShzxWulWsRH,1645214732,Algorand Pushes for Ethereum Compatibility With $20M Incentive Program,"Algorand is putting up $20 million in funding to accelerate development in its ecosystem, according to a Thursday evening announcement by Algorand Foundation CEO Staci Warden at the ETHDenver conference.  Foundation officials said $10 million in grants would go to developers that can provide solutions for Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility, a key cog for emerging networks looking to woo established projects. For Algorand, EVM compatibility means applications that are built on Ethereum or other Ethereum-compatible chains can also execute on Algorand.  The announcement comes as token-rich blockchain projects increasingly turn to funding incentives to lure developer talent into building out their ecosystems.  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre committed to a multichain world,‚Äù Algorand Foundation CEO Staci Warden told CoinDesk in an interview at ETHDenver. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre inspired by the depth of talent and activity in the Ethereum network.‚Äù  Warden told CoinDesk the other $10 million will go toward projects that can build robust developer tools for Algorand. Developer tools are suites of products that make building applications on Algorand easier, such as compilers and debuggers.  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going to dictate what the solutions are,‚Äù said Warden. ‚ÄúOur goal is to get the best minds working on this.‚Äù  Both programs are expected to increase the number of projects on the chain. The twin objectives would allow Algorand to tap into the robust and existing Ethereum-based developer community and also onboard new developers by making building on Algorand simpler.  ‚ÄúThe pitch is the tech,‚Äù said Warden, when asked about Algorand‚Äôs appeal against a sea of base blockchain layers competing for developer talent. ‚ÄúWe simply have the best tech.‚Äù  Algorand claims to be able to execute up to 10,000 transactions per second, costly only fractions of a cent per transaction. Last year, cheap and fast layer 1s experienced an influx of interest as Ethereum users complained about high transaction fees.  Warden told CoinDesk that Algorand is also spearheading ‚Äústate proof‚Äù technology, a feature that would allow developers to take a snapshot of a blockchain in time. The snapshot or ‚Äústate proof‚Äù would serve as a source of truth, allowing transactions to be completed via a smart contract instead of a consensus bridge.  ‚ÄúIn the medium term, our goal is to be the layer 1 that can enable financial inclusion,‚Äù said Warden. ‚ÄúWe believe in a multichain world, but if there‚Äôs only one settlement chain it‚Äôll be Algorand for sure.‚Äù  According to data from Messari, Algorand is among the top 30 blockchains, with a market capitalization of nearly $6 billion.",POSITIVE,ETH,ALGO | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Tracy Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/02/18/algorand-pushes-for-ethereum-compatibility-with-20m-incentive-program,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a3675a70155cbe1b93457fa0c24a990bc487bf2a-4032x3024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42416669,e264UAkMOkEShzxWulWs1b,1645211321,Lehman Brothers Bargain Hunter Bob Diamond Now Paying Up for Crypto,"Bob Diamond made his reputation on Wall Street by boldly buying key assets from Lehman Brothers at a bargain price following the subprime mortgage crisis, back when he was the president of the giant British bank Barclays. Now he‚Äôs paying top dollar to try to replicate that success in the digital assets market.  His latest dramatic move ‚Äì Diamond‚Äôs special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), Concord Acquisition Corp., agreed to double the valuation for U.S.-based stablecoin issuer, Circle ‚Äì shows just how big the stakes are as Wall Street veterans place their bets on the future of finance.  Circle negotiated a new deal on Thursday with Concord that values the company at $9 billion, up from the initial agreement in July that valued it at $4.5 billion. The new deal reflects improvements in Circle's financial outlook and competitive position ‚Äì particularly the growth and market share of USD coin (USDC), according to a statement announcing the re-valuation on Thursday.  A major player  In 2008, Diamond spearheaded Barclays' acquisition of some key assets of the embattled Lehman Brothers following the subprime mortgage crisis, which not only impressed Barclays‚Äô shareholders but also made the bank a major player on Wall Street. Diamond resigned from his position in 2012 after Barclays was hit with a massive fine for trying to manipulate Libor interest rates.  The new Circle deal shows Diamond is now looking to replicate his success with Lehman Brothers in the digital assets business. ""We continue to believe that Circle is one of the most interesting, innovative and exciting companies in the evolution of global finance and we believe it will have an historic impact on the global economic system,"" said Diamond, Concord's chairman, in the statement.  Circle was co-founded in 2013 by Jeremy Allaire, a technologist who has long seen the disruptive potential of the internet. In addition to issuing USDC in partnership with the Coinbase crypto exchange, Circle owns equity crowdfunding platform SeedInvest and for a time owned crypto exchange Poloniex until divesting it in October 2019. In 2018, the payment services firm achieved unicorn status after closing a Series E fundraising round that pushed its valuation to nearly $3 billion.  Still an appetite for crypto  Circle‚Äôs new deal comes at a time when some other crypto companies that are aiming to go public are struggling to gain traction with investors when the broader crypto market pulled back from its peak last year. Recently, crypto mining companies such as Core Scientific and Rhodium Enterprises that were slated to go public in the first half of this year received pushback from investors and had to delay their deals due to volatile markets.  However, Circle‚Äôs new deal shows there is still an appetite for crypto firms that are set to make a mark across the wider crypto ecosystem, and Circle‚Äôs issuance of one of the world‚Äôs leading stablecoins certainly qualifies.  A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency whose value is tied to an outside asset, such as the U.S. dollar or gold, to stabilize the price. USDC was launched in 2018 and was developed in conjunction with Circle‚Äôs affiliated CENTRE consortium, of which Coinbase is also a part. The stablecoin is backed by cash and equivalents and short-duration U.S. Treasury bonds and is redeemable 1:1 for U.S. dollars.  ‚ÄúWith the [U.S. Federal Reserve] dragging their feet on the digital dollar, they've left a wide gap for the private sector to capitalize on the issuance of stablecoins,‚Äù Mati Greenspan, founder of Quantum Economics, told CoinDesk. ‚ÄúBeing backed by incumbent financial institutions, Circle's USDC coin is currently a clear leader in a rapidly growing market,‚Äù Greenspan added.  ""Circle has made massive strides toward transforming the global economic system through the power of digital currencies and the open internet,"" said Allaire, Circle's co-founder and CEO in Thursday‚Äôs statement.

42421854,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXwSVh,1645211171,What Is Crypto Custody?,"Crypto custody is a term used to describe the process of securing assets from theft. Custodians ‚Äì third parties that can be hired to look after your crypto for you ‚Äì act as safeguards of your money, be it cash, securities, gold bars or virtual assets. Custodians have been around since the 1960s and are one of the pillars of the traditional banking system.  When it comes to crypto custody, it works a little bit differently. Digital asset custodians do not technically store any of the assets because all data and transactions exist on a public ledger called the blockchain. Instead, what they guard are users‚Äô private keys ‚Äì the important part of a crypto wallet that grants access to the funds held in it.  Crypto custodians are essential for the widespread adoption of digital assets. To this day, many institutional investors stay away from buying digital assets because of the lack of security. Institutions that manage large amounts of money such as hedge funds, pension funds, investment banks and family offices, are required by regulation to have a custody partner to keep their clients' money safe.  As more institutional investors started to dabble in digital assets and companies like MicroStrategy began to place large amounts of cryptocurrency on their balance sheets, the demand for crypto custody services skyrocketed. A report by Blockdata shows the size of digital assets under custody grew sevenfold between January 2019 and January 2022, from $32 billion to $223 billion.  Read more: Buying Your First Crypto? 10 Things You Should Know  How does crypto custody work?  Simply put, crypto custody means securing the private key that proves you own of the funds held within your crypto wallet. In traditional banking, all custodians are financial institutions, as required by law. With crypto, however, holders have the opportunity to become their own custodians. Using gold bars as an analogy, you can either store them under your bed to keep them safe yourself or pay a third-party custodian to lock them in a vault protected by security guards.  With that in mind, there are two main types of crypto custody for you to know.  Self-custody  As discussed, self-custody is when you personally hold the private key for your own wallet. This means you are the only one who can prove ownership of your funds and access your holdings. With great power, however, comes great responsibility. Being your own custodian means having complete control over your wallet, but it also means you bear all the risks too. If you lose access to your physical device (cold wallet) or forget the private key, your crypto will most likely be gone forever.  Third-party custody  Those who do not want to take the responsibility of managing their own accounts or find it too intimidating to deal with the tech might want to turn to a third-party custodian. These are registered, regulated financial institutions that have acquired a state-level or national license to act as a custodian.  This type of crypto custodian holds clients‚Äô private keys to their wallets in a safe manner and ensures the security of their holdings. From the user's point of view, it is similar to having a checking account with a bank. When you register to open an account, you must undergo know-your-customer and anti-money laundering checks. When you store crypto with a third-party custodian, you‚Äôll be expected to complete the same sort of checks to make sure your cryptocurrency was not acquired through illegal means.  There are three different kinds of third-party crypto custodians based on the financial institutions:  Exchanges  All centralized cryptocurrency exchanges take care of their customers‚Äô crypto custody. Some crypto exchanges and platforms outsource their security needs to an external custody provider that safeguards the assets under management. In any case, it‚Äôs worth knowing that when you set up an account and hold assets on a centralized exchange, you do not hold the private keys to your exchange wallet. This exposes you to potential losses if the exchange is hacked or disappears with users‚Äô funds.  Digital asset managers  As cryptocurrencies have matured as their own asset class there has been an emergence of digital asset managers that act like banks for crypto holders. These institutions, like banks, are regulated and licensed to offer crypto custody. Most notable native crypto custodians include Anchorage, NYDIG and Paxos.  Custodial banks  Starting in July 2020, every custodial bank in the U.S. can custody cryptocurrencies, too, after the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) cleared the way for all nationally chartered banks to provide crypto custody services. This opened the door for custody giants such as BNY Mellon, Citibank and Fidelity to enter the crypto custody market.  Note that some of the third-party custody providers (Fidelity, BitGo, Bakkt) are only available for institutional investors. Others may require a minimum balance so high that it excludes most everyday holders from accessing their services. For example, Coinbase‚Äôs dedicated crypto custody service, Coinbase Trust, requires a whopping minimum balance of $500,000 in digital assets to qualify for its custody system.  Don‚Äôt fret if you don‚Äôt have that sort of money invested in cryptocurrency. Some custody providers have made their services available for retail clients, too. A few examples include:  Blockchain.com  Casa  Gemini  Nuri (formerly Bitwalla)  How much does third-party crypto custody cost?  As with any type of service, providers typically charge a number of fees for safekeeping your money, just as regular banks do when you have a checking or savings account. Moving crypto in and out of your account also can incur fees. These costs usually fall into one of the following three categories.  Custody fee: Custodians ask for a certain percentage point based on the value of the assets under custody every year. This is usually less than 1%.  Setup fee: a flat rate for opening a custodial account. It‚Äôs worth noting some crypto custodians waive the fee and let users open an account for free.  Withdrawal fee: You might pay a fee every time you take crypto out of your account. This can be a flat rate or a percentage point of the value you withdraw.  As an example, U.S.-based Gemini has a 0.4% annual custody fee. The company waives the setup fee so you don‚Äôt have to pay to open an account but any withdrawal from the account costs $125, which is deducted from the crypto asset you withdraw.  If you choose to go with self-custody, you save on the custody, setup and withdrawal fees, but do not expect it to be free. The user has to take care of the wallet and buy a storage product to keep the private key safe.  Read more: Your First Crypto Wallet: How to Use It and Why You Need One  Pros and cons of crypto custody  When you‚Äôre weighing which crypto custody solution to choose, first consider your needs. The right option depends on what kind of investor you are, how much you hold and how familiar you are with technology.  Self-custody  Pros:  Your key, your coins: Only you have access to your account.  No counterparty risk.  Cons:  If you lose your key, you lose access to your coins.  Your assets are not insured.  If hacked, you can say goodbye to your holdings forever.  Third-party custody  Pros:  The custodian takes care of everything.  Easier access for beginners.  Custodians have insurance on assets they manage.  In some cases, you can earn interest from the crypto you deposit by staking or lending through the third-party custodian.  Cons:  The custodian controls your coins. It can freeze your assets, block your access to your wallet or limit withdrawals.  Third-party risk: A custodian can be hacked or go bankrupt.

Bitcoin Long-Term Holder SOPR Shows Some Spikes Recently As pointed out by an analyst in a CrypoQuant post, some BTC long-term holders seem to have participated in profit taking over the past day. The relevant indicator here is the spent output profit ratio (or the SOPR in brief), which tells us about the profit ratio of the whole Bitcoin market. The metric works by checking the past history of each coin being sold on the chain to see what price it was moved at before. If this previous price was less than the current one, then the coin moved at a profit. Similarly, if the current price is higher, then the investor sold this coin at a loss. When the value of the SOPR is above one, it means investors are, on average, selling at a profit right now. Related Reading | Bitcoin Sentiment Reaches Local High, But Can&apos;t Shake Recent Fear On the other hand, when the indicator&apos;s value is less than one, it implies investors are selling at a loss overall at the moment.

42421678,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXova1,1645208365,ETHDenver Shows Not All Crypto Communities Are the Same,"Thursday was the first day of the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù ETHDenver conference, complete with an opening ceremony. That doesn‚Äôt feel terribly meaningful because the pre-conference #BUIDLweek has been going full steam ahead for days, and there will be post-conference stuff going on for days after (Breckenridge Ski Resort, brace yourself). It did bring a huge influx of general-public attendees, though. More on them in a moment.  I spent the day at Schelling Point, a one-day miniconference within the conference, held at the same huge six-floor ‚ÄúCrypto Castle‚Äù as the bulk of the main conference (confused yet?). The Crypto Castle is pitch-perfect ETHWorld, featuring an NFT (non-fungible token) gallery decorated with e-waste and vacuum cleaner parts, attendees dressed like space fairies dancing through the halls, and tables and tables of free T-shirts, most of them bright purple and featuring some kind of cartoon animal.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Schelling Point was focused on, for my money, the most interesting intellectual stream in cryptocurrency: incentive design for social good. A ‚ÄúSchelling Point‚Äù is very broadly a thing that brings people together organically to interact or collaborate, without communication or planning. Schelling Points can be actual places or social nexuses like a campfire, or more abstract convergence points like price in a free market. Naval Ravikant likely introduced the game theory concept to many crypto types.  Most Schelling Point speakers discussed the broad question of how to use distributed systems to organize people to improve the world. DAOs, or decentralized autonomous organizations, were frequently brought up as voluntary gathering places for people to take collective action. That‚Äôs a really exciting concept because unlike the social media platforms or forums where many socially-concerned people spend time now, DAOs have actual power (and money) directly attached. Belonging to a DAO can feel like a meaningful choice. And as the history of online forums shows, it‚Äôs clear we need a richer alternative to collaboration online and take real-world action.  It‚Äôs also clear that crypto has become a Schelling Point, or a series of Schelling Points, for politics. Bitcoin has been a massive conceptual magnet for libertarian thought and activism. And the Schelling Point event was a window into the much-less-widely understood politics of the Ethereum community. The distinction is almost always lost in loose criticisms of ‚Äúcrypto‚Äù as fundamentally regressive or antisocial.  Ethereum politics is still essentially a capitalist framework, as speaker Abbey Titcomb of Radicle emphasized. But what separates Ethereum politics from the type of hyper-capitalist libertarianism often advocated by bitcoiners is a clear-eyed acceptance that markets as currently structured fail, again and again, in predictable and well-understood ways and need both restructuring and supplementing. ‚Äã‚ÄãIf you strapped ‚ÄúBitcoin Standard‚Äù author Saifedean Ammous into a ‚ÄúClockwork Orange‚Äù-style viewing chair in front of a talk titled ‚ÄúMorality and Market Failure,‚Äù I suspect he would burst into flames.  See also: Ethereum's Political Philosophy Explained | Paul Dylan-Ennis  At Schelling Point, there was a particular focus on environmental externalities and underfunded public goods, topics on which ideological bitcoiners often seem not just indifferent but even hostile. Several speakers discussed ‚Äúregenerative economics,‚Äù a framework that aims to restructure markets to incentivize maintenance of natural resources and the ‚Äúcommons.‚Äù There were also frequent and trenchant critiques of contemporary democratic processes, particularly the slow feedback loop between elections and legislative action. A broad consensus emerged on the crucial importance of giving people more frequent and varied ways to signal their desires and have those signals actually have an impact on the way the world is run.  The event was backed by Gitcoin, a fundraising platform oriented towards social change initiatives. Gitcoin co-founder Vivek Muthra captured both the vibe and the challenge of the conference‚Äôs premise when he declared that ‚Äúwe owe something to people who are not in this room today, and that‚Äôs something those of us fortunate to be here should think about.‚Äù Can we remember ‚Äúpeople who are not yet part of the game,‚Äù and can we ‚Äúwelcome them quickly and meaningfully?‚Äù he asked.  Admirable though it was, this call to action would prove a bit ironic: Not everyone would be quickly and meaningfully welcomed into the game of ETHDenver. As I mentioned, a lot of new attendees showed up on Thursday, and I mean a lot. According to an organizer, there were roughly 20,000 applications for about 7,000 available free tickets to the conference. Lines to register and get into events were long all day ‚Äì I heard of waits up to three hours to get into the Crypto Castle.  I wouldn‚Äôt know anything about that, though, because I have a glorious badge, better than the general public‚Äôs wristbands. Having a badge means breezing right past those long lines. This isn‚Äôt uncommon at conferences, but it‚Äôs uniquely structured at ETHDenver. For most conferences, you pay a lot more money to get a higher-access badge. While there are ""VIP"" style passes available, the vast majority of badgeholders at ETHDenver seem to be presenters, organizers, and volunteers.  See also: Are DAOs Socialist? | Paul Dylan-Ennis  In short, status, influence, and involvement are more powerful currencies here than mere cash (though some of the badged probably have plenty of that, too). That's part of how ETHDenver has accomplished a minor miracle: It's a crypto conference that doesn't feel like it's primarily about money.

42421676,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXovVt,1645207731,Getting Beyond the Good-Bad NFT Debate,"It‚Äôs striking how wide the cultural gulf has become between NFTs‚Äô many vociferous supporters and an equally loud contingent of NFT critics.  To the former, NFTs are about freedom ‚Äì a ticket to a brighter Web 3 future in which creatives and users liberate themselves from the internet platforms.  To the latter, NFTs represent all that‚Äôs wrong with late-stage capitalism: rampant greed, an incentive to fraud, wanton disregard for the environment.  You‚Äôre reading¬†Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter¬†here.  Both are wrong.  The boosters wear rose-colored glasses. Many elements of the Web 3 vision must be in place before it will evolve in the wider interests of humanity. Without those solutions, we‚Äôll end up with a system that temporarily delivers extravagant profits to a few early opportunists.  And the critics? They have a static view of technology. As with many flawed attacks on crypto, they assume the current snapshot of the industry‚Äôs development ‚Äì of Ethereum‚Äôs high transaction costs and limited scalability, for example ‚Äì is permanent. This betrays an ignorance of how innovation occurs within open-source systems and assumes that thousands of motivated developers haven‚Äôt already recognized the same elephant in the room and started maneuvering it out the door.  My own view: NFTs are vital building blocks for a new creator-centric digital economy in which our data is no longer mined by internet platforms and in which artists, musicians, photographers, journalists and publishers are able to connect directly with their audiences. But they are only that, building blocks.  What we build on top of them is up to us. It could be liberating. Or it could be evil. The choice is ours.  Our digital present  To understand the role NFTs will play in this, it‚Äôs useful to look at the present and past of property rights. (Before smarty-pants legal scholars start @ing me, I am not saying NFTs, in and of themselves, represent property rights. Far from it. I‚Äôm saying they are a necessary but insufficient element of the digital and legal infrastructure needed to establish such rights.)  First, the digital present: Until now, we‚Äôve had no means to define unique digital objects. We couldn‚Äôt label something as a piece of digital property, not in terms of how ‚Äúthings‚Äù in the analog world ‚Äì such as a house or a car ‚Äì are viewed as standalone ‚Äúassets‚Äù that a person can own and control.  We‚Äôve continued to recognize and (tried to) enforce intellectual property concepts such as copyright in the digital age. But IP is not digital property per se ‚Äì it exists outside of both the physical and digital realms, even if the law demands that it be exercised within those realms.  Enforcement is comparatively easy in the physical realm, because the vessels in which copyrighted concepts are distributed ‚Äì such as books, or LP records ‚Äì cannot be so easily reproduced or pirated and so are identified as separate assets from the intellectual property.  Read more: Michael Casey - The Value of NFTs Is Belonging  In the digital realm, the abundant replication and sharing of PDFs, MPEGS and JPEGs has rendered this equivalent notion unworkable online. It‚Äôs why early in the internet era the legal profession gave up on trying to apply ‚Äúthe first sale doctrine‚Äù ‚Äì which permits the resale of, say, a used book but not the unlicensed sale of the copyrighted ideas within it ‚Äì to digital files.  The core point is there's really no such thing as digital property. By extension, there‚Äôs no such thing as digital property rights ‚Äì not in the sense of a right to own and resell a digital file.  This is why the invention of NFTs, which have the potential to become the online equivalent of a serial number for digital content files, are so important. They offer a framework for identifying property and, by extension, for building other solutions that will allow us to establish and enforce rights.  Our analog past  Throughout history, the extension of property rights to a wider class of human beings has catalyzed economic and social development.  Examples: King John‚Äôs Magna Carta agreement with English barons in 1215; the formation of the Dutch East India Company as the first joint stock company in 1602; the enshrinement of the right to private property in China‚Äôs post-Mao revival, which resulted in in almost 90% home ownership ‚Äì some 470 million households.  The Peruvian economist Hernando de Soto argues that property rights and the legally enforceable contracts that arise around those rights are the biggest factor distinguishing the economic advance of Western democracies from the underperformance of the developing world.  De Soto‚Äôs thesis hints at why the idea of NFTs-as-property-rights-building-blocks is so compelling. This could be the greatest moment of wealth creation the world has ever seen.  But the mere granting of property rights to a particular person or class of person by no means assures a path to a vibrant, dynamic economy, much less a level playing field.  General Juan Manuel de Rosas, the autocratic governor of Buenos Aires Province, waged war against Argentina‚Äôs indigenous people in the mid-19th century, the fertile Pampas lands he seized were distributed to his own family and to a small group of his most loyal officers. These massive land grants carried the weight of law ‚Äì they constituted executable property rights ‚Äì but they resulted in a political system of patronage that, to this day, undermines Argentina‚Äôs democracy and its capacity for sustainable economic development.  By contrast, ‚Äúunoccupied‚Äù land in colonial New South Wales was entirely claimed by the Crown. (I use quote marks because for two centuries the law ignored Aboriginals‚Äô land rights) It was then distributed, in small lots, to freed convicts and, later, returning veterans of foreign wars. Australia‚Äôs agrarian economy, comprising many striving small landholders, inevitably became more productive than Argentina‚Äôs, where a few caudillos dominated the most fertile land in the world.  Read more: Joon Ian Wong - The Future of NFTs Is Fungible  There are lessons in all this for NFTs and for the concept of digital property rights generally as developers figure out how to scale the technology and make it applicable to the real world.  Building blocks  To repeat: the holder of an NFT does not automatically hold a property right. Control over the token and rights to the art to which it points are distinctly different things. But startups are working on solutions to prove that a particular NFT can be used to assert a legitimate rights claim. If their models work, they will help NFTs fulfill their promise as the building blocks for a radical new system of digital property rights.  These solutions are arising because capitalism demands it. The Hollywood studios and media companies now embracing NFTs need a legally enforceable system for establishing and assigning rights to their NFT-able content inventory.  Here, too, there‚Äôs no guarantee these will develop in the broad public interests. That result depends on us.  Here‚Äôs what we do know: NFTs are not going away. Bridges to property rights will be built. Ranting about how unjust or garish they are is pointless.  If we care about making a better digital world, let‚Äôs take lessons from the history of physical property rights and build something that serves the greater good.",NEUTRAL,ÏóÜÏùå,ASIA | BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Michael J.

42421194,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXgIdZ,1645206764,Into the Metaverse With CyBall‚Äôs Tin Tran,"The rise of play-to-earn gaming throughout 2021 presented metaverse-based income-earning opportunities for millions of people all around the world. But it was the rise of the scholarship model that ensured those jobs were accessible by those who needed them most.  First popularized within the game Axie Infinity, a scholarship is an arrangement where the owner of an in-game non-fungible token (NFT) loans it to someone else, who uses it to play the game and win crypto-based rewards. Then, the owner and player split the prizes between them. It‚Äôs a new take on an age-old business model, allowing newbies to get into the game without the hefty upfront capital requirement of buying their own NFTs, while also demonstrating the huge utility of NFTs in their ability to be rented out ‚Äì just like any other traditional productive asset.  Crypto State by CoinDesk, our virtual community event tour, stops in Southeast Asia on Feb. 24. The discussion will explore the metaverse and its implications. The tour is in partnership with Luno, like CoinDesk owned by Digital Currency Group. Register for ""Metaverse: Gimmick or Distributed Innovation?"" here.  Spawned by the community, not the game publisher, the process for scouting and vetting of suitable scholarship recipients, known as scholars, was always external to the game of Axie itself. But with rising demand, some blockchain games are now seeking to internalize and automate the system, making it easier for owners of the in-game NFTs to allow others to borrow and use their inactive assets, while ensuring the structuring of each agreement is transparent.  Read more: A Crypto Guide to the Metaverse  Cyball, a football-themed play-to-earn game is one such game. Operating across both Solana and Binance Smart Chain (BSC), and developed out of Vietnam, where the production studio behind Axie Infinity is also based, players of CyBall collect NFT characters called CyBlocs that compete to see who can score the most goals, in the hope of earning the game‚Äôs CBT token.  When they are not using them to play, owners of CyBlocs can use the CyLoans in-game asset lending system to share their NFTs with others. Terms of the agreement can be set via the platform, including revenue share and loan duration. If they feel the terms are reasonable, borrowers can apply directly, knowing payouts will be handled trustlessly via smart contracts.  Read more: How Brands Can Co-Create in a Metaverse  The innovative feature, which streamlines onboarding and eases the many logistical challenges of having to manually manage a broad portfolio of digital assets and a large group of scholars, has proven particularly popular with play-to-earn gaming guilds. CyBall has secured partnerships with six guilds to date, including Yield Guild Games (YGG), Merit Circle, GuildFi, Good Games Guild (GGG), and Ancient8, the latter being focused on Vietnamese players.  Here, Tin Tran, co-founder of CyBall, explains why it was always inevitable that Southeast Asia would be the world‚Äôs first region to see widespread adoption of play-to-earn games.  What opportunities can NFT games and/or the Metaverse offer to people in Southeast Asia, that they may not otherwise have had access to?  NFT games, as we have seen over the past 12 months, have provided earning opportunities for many people in Southeast Asia, no matter what walk of life they come from. We have witnessed this with the Philippines and how the country has thrived from this movement. Many people have given up their day jobs to play games full time and earn a living that would be able to support their families. Thus, play-to-earn games are funneling value directly into Southeast Asia‚Äôs economy.  As the metaverse opens up, we will see the diversity of different channels of yield and earnings also open up. The accessibility of which is as simple as an internet connection on a phone or PC.  The COVID-19 pandemic was a significant driver of adoption of play-to-earn games throughout 2020 and 2021. Going forward, what other factors will accelerate expansion of the ecosystem?  The pandemic was a catalyst, and once the momentum was created, we saw a wave of adoption from people who saw that play-to-earn could be a worthwhile means of income, particularly in the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia and surrounding countries. These countries are known for their large base of traditional gamers, so the fact that they were the first to embrace play-to-earn, was inevitable.  Southeast Asia will continue to lead the way on crypto adoption through gaming, as this region has the perfect demographic of young, tech savvy, gaming enthusiasts to further this space. The movement has already gained significant traction and the infrastructure built will facilitate the further development of more guilds and games, which in turn will accelerate the expansion of the ecosystem.

42421671,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXovOf,1645204144,"Skyweaver Is a Great Blockchain Game, and an OK Regular Game","At least in theory, gamers should be an easy demographic for NFT adoption. They‚Äôll proudly display digital game libraries worth thousands of dollars and covet abstract objects like ‚Äúperfect runs‚Äù of their favorite role-playing games. The first time I ever saw the words ‚Äúdigital wallet‚Äù was on Steam, a popular gaming platform. Gamers and NFT afficionados share an appreciation for ‚Äúdigital goods‚Äù and are willing to spend ludicrous sums of money on stupid trinkets.  But it has been an uphill battle for NFT developers to endear themselves to self-identified gamers. The mere mention of an NFT, or non-fungible token, will immediately earn a harsh rebuke on social media. It doesn‚Äôt help that the charge into mainstream NFT-based games is led by Electronic Arts, which has a notorious reputation for ruining beloved franchises, and Activision, which is also known for destroying beloved intellectual properties (to say nothing of the well-documented corporate culture that enabled rampant sexual harrassment).  Despite the odds stacked against it, Skyweaver, the latest play-to-earn NFT gaming phenomenon, might reach an audience beyond crypto. The actual iPhone app runs smoothly. The onboarding process takes you straight to the action, though the tutorial was perhaps a few beats too long. The art is reminiscent of an aged-up Superman: The Animated Series, and looks really good. Most importantly, the game is fun.  See also: NFT Trading Card Game Skyweaver Wraps Yearslong Tech  Once I had slogged through the tutorial and leveled up enough to unlock all the core identities, I had a good time learning the different types of decks and setting up card combos. It was hours before the game started gently steering me towards its digital marketplace. Horizon, the game‚Äôs developer, is invested in selling its player base on the game Skyweaver before they sell them on a shiny new investment opportunity ‚Äì a winning strategy.  Crypto gaming companies that put their in-game currencies or digital assets before the product are going to struggle to attract people outside of the NFT community. By treating its blockchain elements as a secondary detail, Skyweaver will be able to lure players in with its slick app and smooth gameplay.  Unfortunately, I have a hard time imagining Skyweaver escaping comparisons to Activision-Blizzards‚Äô Hearthstone, the most successful digital card game ever made. While the once-mighty franchise wasn‚Äôt the only card game to use a fixed resource economy and focus the player on card interactions ‚Äì my personal favorite of these kinds of games, Duelyst, used a similar system and was in development long before ‚Äì it was by far the most successful, and has dominated the collective imagination of trading card games ever since.  From what I‚Äôve seen of Skyweaver, the card effects are much more restrained than Hearthstone, which encouraged players to use and abuse overpowered cards. There is a big upside to Skyweaver‚Äôs approach. Since your opponent‚Äôs moves are more predictable, it‚Äôs easier to set up a counter play. Since your counter-options are pretty narrow, your opponent can account for them and use that against you. Suddenly, both players are thinking three moves ahead. This back and forth was gripping for the first few hours I played, but it wore thin.  As it stands, there is nothing novel about ‚ÄúSkyweaver.‚Äù It doesn‚Äôt have Netrunner‚Äôs asymmetry, the area control of Summoners Wars or the sheer weirdness of Arkham Horror: The Card Game, which for my money does a better job of translating cosmic horror into a game than any other H.P. Lovecraft property. I‚Äôm not even mentioning single-player card games like Signs of the Sojourner or Inscryption that reimagine what a card game can be.  Skyweaver is a leaner, meaner Hearthstone, which has been hemorrhaging players for the past two years. Does that mean that people are looking for a leaner, meaner version of Hearthstone, or that players are kind of tired of that particular type of game? For me, it was the latter.  For a casual player, most of the money they can make playing this game will likely go straight back into it. This isn‚Äôt a new phenomenon in digital card games. All free-to-play games provide a steady drip of in-game currency to keep their players engaged. Given the small amount of free cards I‚Äôve gotten during my time with the game, Skyweaver is on the stingy side.  See also: NFTs Are Boring; Here's How to Make Them Fun | Opinion  If Skyweaver‚Äôs hook is that I can sell my cards for U.S. dollars, then I don‚Äôt see them cracking into the mainstream. If I commit myself to the game enough that I put together a decent card collection, I‚Äôm not going to want to sell those cards. Collectable cards can be an interesting investment opportunity, but mainstream players will be interested in how they function in-game, and many people will just enjoy them as keepsakes. I sold my Netrunner collection for double what I paid for it, and I still wistfully look at its empty spot in my game collection.

42416681,e264UAkMOkEShzxWulWsXh,1645203990,"State Lawmakers in Illinois, Georgia Propose Tax Incentives for Bitcoin Miners","The U.S. states of Georgia and Illinois are both looking to introduce tax incentives for cryptocurrency mining, according to legislation filed this year.  According to a bill introduced on Thursday, House representatives in Georgia are proposing tax exemptions for the sale or use of electricity in crypto mining activities. An Illinois Senate bill introduced in late January is also looking to extend an existing tax incentive for data centers to crypto mining.  Mining describes the computing process through which popular cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether are minted. The energy-intensive process has come under fire by regulators around the world, but the U.S. has embraced it and is now the market leader in crypto mining.  Georgia and Illinois are just the latest to consider tax incentives for miners. Both Texas and Kentucky offer similar tax breaks to attract miners to their states. Meanwhile, at the national level, Senators Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) are looking to make sure a crypto tax reporting provision in the U.S. infrastructure bill does not apply to miners.  After China ‚Äì previously the world leader in bitcoin mining ‚Äì outlawed all crypto mining activities in the country in May 2021, the U.S. quickly picked up on demand. According to data from the Cambridge University‚Äôs Centre for Alternative Finance, within three months of China‚Äôs ban the U.S. became the hottest bitcoin mining spot in the world, racking up 35% of the bitcoin hashrate, or the computing power used per second in the bitcoin mining process.  Like Kentucky House Bill 230, the Georgia House Bill 1342 is looking to entice bitcoin miners by offering tax breaks for energy use. The four Republican lawmakers in Georgia who introduced the bill are seeking to amend the state‚Äôs official tax code to include ‚Äúexemptions from sales and use tax, so as to exempt the sale or use of electricity‚Äù used in the commercial mining of digital assets.  Meanwhile, the bipartisan Illinois Senate Bill 3643, introduced by State Sen. Sue Rezin (R) looks to amend the Civil Administrative Code of Illinois to include crypto mining centers as ""qualifying Illinois Data center"" over a 60-month period, effective immediately if the bill is passed and then signed into law by the governor. State Sen. Julie A. Morrison (D) added her name to the bill on Wednesday.  But to qualify for the Illinois tax incentive, existing and new enterprises looking to make use of the incentive must first make an investment of no less than $250 million in the state and create at least 20 full-time jobs. Within two years of qualifying, enterprises must also certify they are carbon neutral, according to the proposed bill.  Meanwhile, some federal lawmakers led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), are scrutinizing crypto mining companies on their climate impact.

Skale‚Äôs first $5 million in grants will be awarded to projects focused on the rapidly-growing blockchain gaming sector, including play-to-earn (P2E) games and the metaverse. For the kickoff program, Skale is partnering with Network of Decentralized Economics (NODE), a Liechtenstein-based foundation.  Instead of a single entity awarding the $100 million in funds, Skale will feature a number of different groups collaborating around the issuance process, which includes prominent corporations, DAO and nonprofits.

42416673,e264UAkMOkEShzxWulWsHe,1645202482,Inside IBM‚Äôs Fast-Growing Crypto Custody Play,"IBM, originally one of the biggest supporters of permissioned blockchains, is now carefully positioning its hardware security and cloud computing capabilities around the safekeeping of cryptocurrencies and digital assets.  With much less of the fanfare that accompanied its enterprise blockchain experimentation, IBM‚Äôs cryptographic key management infrastructure is becoming a complementary technology to a growing list of crypto custody firms such as Hex Trust, Protego Trust, Propine, Unbound, Onchain Custodian and most recently, Swiss custody firm Metaco.  This matters because IBM works with lots of banks and large financial institutions, almost all of which have woken up to the concept of crypto assets and are currently in search of suitable and safe ways to handle them.  IBM was publicly connected to crypto custody in 2020 via Promontory Financial, a consulting firm wholly owned by Big Blue, that was deeply involved in Wyoming‚Äôs special purpose depository institution (SPDI) charter. Promontory was also involved in the national charter granted to custody firm Anchorage Digital.  But it was back in 2016, right around the time the 110-year-old computing giant was diving into enterprise blockchain, that IBM‚Äôs head of digital asset infrastructure, Peter DeMeo, started looking closely at the technology. Indeed, IBM‚Äôs extensive foray into enterprise blockchain was a learning experience for DeMeo, who says he wants to be careful not to replicate the same level of expectation that came with it.  ‚ÄúIBM could certainly offer a custody stack and do ‚ÄòIBM, the custodian‚Äô,‚Äù said DeMeo in an interview with CoinDesk. ‚ÄúBut to do that right really requires organizational commitment. And I saw what happened with blockchain. Whilst there are successes with the permissioned blockchains, they‚Äôre not huge moneymakers.‚Äù  Rather than competing with existing crypto custody firms, partnerships are a more natural next step for IBM, DeMeo added. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre basically going to be layer zero for blockchain tech for others to build on top, and we provide a set of tools in order to do that.‚Äù  Institutional comfort  IBM currently supplies many of the world‚Äôs banks with hardware security modules (HSMs) ‚Äì physical computing environments for protecting keys and encrypting various functions, which can become inoperable when tampered with.  But ‚Äúhardware is dead‚Äù is a narrative that‚Äôs gained a lot of momentum recently, especially among the cryptocurrency and Web 3 development community, said Adrien Treccani, founder and CEO of Metaco, in an interview. Now it‚Äôs all about the cool and extremely practical things you can do with software, he said, like splitting up keys into fragments and securing them without the use of hardware.  Problems occur, however, when it comes to the governance policies and authorization processes around the access to cryptographic keys, which often ends up being done on a normal server, according to Treccani.  ‚ÄúThe weak point of your system becomes this piece of the authorization process before you get access to the keys, and that‚Äôs one of the challenges that companies like ourselves are facing on a daily basis,‚Äù said Treccani.  Large institutional players entering crypto want bank-grade computing, he added, where a special-purpose operating system on adapted security hardware handles and attests to the integrity of everything: deployment of code, execution, maintenance, auditing, etc.  ‚ÄúIBM invested in this so-called confidential computing very early on, and has done it both for their on-premise Linux One mainframes, which pretty much every bank in the world uses, and also for their cloud capabilities,‚Äù Teccani said.  From the point of view of an institution-focused crypto custody provider, working with a storied company like IBM has been ‚Äúsuper helpful,‚Äù said Calvin Shen, Head of Business Development at Hong Kong-based Hex Trust, the first crypto custody firm to start working with IBM back in 2019.  ‚ÄúHex Trust was relatively new to some of these big banks, who perhaps just saw us as a startup,‚Äù Shen said in an interview. ‚ÄúBut when they were doing due diligence, we would say, ‚ÄòHey guys, we‚Äôre building on our IBM Linux one platform,‚Äô and that makes those institutions feel comfortable.‚Äù  Workflow headache  These days, banks and financial institutions are also attracted by clever security techniques such as multi-party computation, whereby private keys are split and stored in different locations. That said, those same institutions must be able to show they have full control over their assets at all times.  This is really a workflow issue, which is something most crypto custody firms haven‚Äôt really thought through, said IBM‚Äôs DeMeo. There is a need to manage policy around what administrators can do, thus preventing the possibility of internal collusion ‚Äì changing the rules around digital signature thresholds, for example. Another component is ‚Äúsecure build,‚Äù which means eliminating backdoor attacks when software is added.  ‚ÄúWe have a technical environment where you can deploy your stack, where you write it and we take care of the rest,‚Äù said DeMeo. ‚ÄúWe also have a way to put stuff into that environment where it‚Äôs fully attested. Last but not least, when it comes to key management, we are talking about having keys encrypted 100% of the time and never exposed to the internet ‚Äì a preeminent, world-class cold storage.‚Äù  An additional risk IBM addresses is the increasingly common possibility that an institution‚Äôs custody tech partner could be acquired, as was the case with Unbound, BitGo, Curv, ShardX and GK8. This can create the headache of moving highly sensitive digital asset functions elsewhere.  ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre a bank and you bet your dollar on any of these guys, well, you have a seed migration issue because you have to do something else,‚Äù DeMeo said. ‚ÄúWe create the ability to do off-chain migration of seed, to retain the seed and not create a new one.‚Äù  Not a binary choice  The debate over whether hardware security modules, multi-signature or multi-party computation (MPC) offers the most appropriate security technology is pushing the boundaries when it comes to state-of-the-art crypto custody.  ‚ÄúHSM versus MPC doesn‚Äôt have to be a binary choice,‚Äù said Hex Trust‚Äôs Shen. ‚ÄúThe next big thing is MPC on HSM. That‚Äôs coming, and people are certainly cognizant of this hybrid.‚Äù  Treccani echoed this, pointing out that some of Metaco‚Äôs clients want to use MPC for their hot wallets and HSM for cold storage, often in combination, and it‚Äôs been driving exploration in this overlapping area.  ‚ÄúThe qualities of MPC are elegantly complemented with the qualities of hardware if you‚Äôre able to embed one in the other,‚Äù said Treccani. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to say too much about it because this technology doesn‚Äôt officially exist today, but I think the next step is MPC within HSM.‚Äù  Penetrating the exchange market  IBM‚Äôs main market for its digital asset suite remains the banks that already use its LinuxOne mainframes and who can deploy a digital assets stack that connects to their core banking system without the need for any additional infrastructure.  Thus far, cryptocurrency exchanges have yet to be convinced of the benefits of using IBM technology, despite the reputational damage and substantial losses that could result from collusive attacks and inside jobs that happen periodically in crypto.  While he‚Äôs now having considerable success courting banks and larger fintech firms looking to explore digital assets, it‚Äôs puzzling to DeMeo that IBM has not been able to generate any traction with the more established crypto exchanges.  After all, the cost of an IBM mainframe is a drop in the bucket to a firm like Binance, said DeMeo, and when you ‚Äúpeel back the onion,‚Äù most crypto exchanges have little in the way of controls to stop a rogue chief technology officer disappearing with all the funds.  ‚ÄúPersonally, I don‚Äôt understand it,‚Äù DeMeo said. ‚ÄúInvest in this technology and the likelihood of you experiencing this type of attack is greatly reduced.‚Äù  UPDATE (Feb. 28, 15:28 UTC):¬†Modifies list of IBM custody clients.",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/02/18/inside-ibms-fast-growing-crypto-custody-play,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/313204ddfaa6246bd33428165c5a2a97e55292e6-2000x1334.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Render is the name given to the final image. A scene file containing objects in a rigorously specified language or data structure can have many models.

The scene file&apos;s data is then supplied to a rendering program, which processes it and outputs it as a digital image.

The market has seen increasing similarities between these two spaces recently. But there&apos;s no guarantee it will continue or even last for very long at all, given how quickly things change in this industry. Pantera Capital believes the crypto market will be able to &apos;decouple&apos; traditional macro assets even when interest rates go up. In the interview on February 1, CEO Dan Morehead and co-chief investment officer Joey Krug both said they believe this transition is happening now. Institutional investors are entering the space, leading them away from stocks or bonds into cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and other related technologies like the blockchain 2030 panel discussion.

42416665,e264UAkMOkEShzxWulWrol,1645193849,Court Orders Freeze of Canadian 'Freedom Convoy' Crypto Fundraising,"A private class action lawsuit against participants in Canada's ""freedom convoy"" has successfully secured an injunction freezing funds raised via crypto donations.  A Mareva injunction was signed on Thursday by Ontario Superior Court of Justice Judge Calum MacLeod and freezes crypto assets in more than 120 different addresses tied to BTC, ADA, ETH, LTC and XMR. A Mareva injunction is a court order used in the U.K. and Canada that freezes a defendant's assets in order to prevent them from being spent, hidden or moved before a judgment is ordered.  The suit also directs several financial institutions, platforms and exchanges to freeze any transactions related to the identified addresses' wallets. The financial institutions include TD Canada Trust and ATB Financial, and the fundraising platforms and websites include GoFundMe and GiveSendGo. Digital assets platforms and exchanges listed were Bull Bitcoin, TallyCoin, BitBuy, Shakepay, Satoshi Portal, Bylls, Binance Smartchain, PancakeSwap and Nunchuk.  The suit, brought by Zexi Li, Happy Goat Coffee Inc. and Geoffrey Devaney, sought to freeze assets raised by Alan Warnock, Tamara Lich, Benjamin Dichter, Patrick King, Christopher Garrah and Nicholas St. Louis.  ""This court orders that the Mareva Respondents and their servants, employees, agents, assigns, officers, directors and anyone else acting on their behalf or in conjunction with any of them, and any and all persons with notice of this Order, are restrained from directly or indirectly, by any means whatsoever: (a) selling, removing, dissipating, alienating, transferring, assigning, encumbering, or similarly dealing with the assets of the Mareva Respondents listed in Schedule 'A'; (b) instructing, requesting, counselling, demanding, or encouraging any other person to conduct themselves contrary to paragraph 2(a) above; and (c) facilitating, assisting in, aiding, abetting, or participating in any acts the effect of which is to contrary to paragraph 2(a) above, until final disposition of this action or further Order of this Court,"" the filing said.  The respondents have a week to respond to the court, explaining what their assets are for, whether they own the assets and to ""submit to an examination under oath.""  Pat King, one of the alleged organizers of the Freedom Convoy and one of the named parties in the Mareva order, was apparently arrested by Ottawa police on Friday while livestreaming on Facebook. King is the third organizer to be arrested, after the earlier arrests of Tamara Lich and Chris Barber.  The plaintiffs in the case all say they were personally affected by the convoy.  Henry Assad, the owner of Happy Goat Coffee Company, told Canadian media that he had to temporarily close three locations due to smashed windows and ongoing harassment of his employees.  Ivan Gedz of Union Local 613 told reporters that his business is down 25-50% because the protests are keeping customers away from downtown Ottawa.  Geoffrey Devaney, another plaintiff in the suit, has reportedly been out of work since the protests started. Zexi Li alleges she was threatened by a trucker when she took a photograph of his license plate.  The news comes days after the Canadian government froze 34 crypto addresses in connection with the ongoing trucker protests, which blocked bridges and border crossings into the U.S. in defiance of Canada's vaccine mandate, under the nation's Emergencies Act.  On Thursday, Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland told reporters that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) was also ordering exchanges to freeze certain addresses.  ""The names of both individuals and entities as well as crypto wallets have been shared by the RCMP with financial institutions and accounts have been frozen and more accounts will be frozen,"" she said.

42416677,e264UAkMOkEShzxWulWsER,1645190157,Frax Finance Is Preparing to Airdrop a CPI-Linked Stablecoin,"Frax Finance is scheduled to distribute its latest stablecoin, the Frax Price Index (FPI), to holders and stakers of its various tokens ‚Äì as long as they own one on Feb. 20.  Frax says the FPI is an ‚Äúinflation resistant‚Äù algorithmic stablecoin, designed to fluctuate in value in line with U.S. government-published consumer price index (CPI) data.  Data is sourced from the Bureau of Labor Statistics‚Äô monthly inflation report and is pushed to the blockchain by an oracle provided by Chainlink.  An algorithmic stablecoin means that the value is derived from a constantly changing basket of underlying digital assets.  The FPI will be denominated in dollars, Frax Finance founder Sam Kazemian explained to CoinDesk in an interview, simply because they are a unit everyone is familiar with.  As an example, should inflation hold at 7%, by the end of the year the token will be worth $1.07  ‚ÄúWe want to be a stablecoin protocol where we have a dollar stablecoin, as well as the successor to the dollar,‚Äù he said.  Eventually, holders of the governance token will be able to vote on the weighting of the basket of goods used by FPI to measure inflation and whether changes to the basket are required.  Frax hasn't set a date for the airdrop. A snapshot will take place Feb. 20 to count the number of eligible wallets.

Sign up here to get it in your inbox each weekday morning.  Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening this morning:  Market Moves: Bitcoin remains under pressure as a long holiday weekend in the U.S. keeps risk appetite under check.  Featured stories: Traditional markets suggest bitcoin may bottom out after March rate hike. Gaming flips DeFi in terms of active user wallets.  And check out the CoinDesk TV show ""First Mover,"" hosted by Christine Lee, Emily Parker and Lawrence Lewitinn at 9:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern time. Today's show will feature guests:  Sergey Gorbunov, CEO and founder, Axelar  Jordan Sherman, CEO, Immortals  Market Moves  By Omkar Godbole  Bitcoin was trading flat to negative even as the European stocks and the S&P 500 futures got a slight tailwind from reports that the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has accepted a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov late next week; subject to ""no further Russian invasion of Ukraine.""  The cryptocurrency saw a minor bounce earlier but failed to retake the bullish trendline. The daily chart relative strength index has dipped into a bearish territory below 50, suggesting scope for continued decline.  A long holiday weekend in the U.S. and a great geopolitical uncertainty is likely to keep risk appetite in check during Friday's North American session, as Bannockburn Global Forex's Marc Chandler said in a blog post. U.S. financial markets will be closed on Monday in observance of Presidents' Day.  Some analysts foresee a deeper decline if geopolitical tensions escalate further. ""Bitcoin is the ultimate risky asset, and a Ukraine invasion would keep crypto selling pressure going another 10-15% over the short term,"" Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda, said in an email.  Besides, Federal Reserve rate hike fears and regulatory concerns might keep bullish moves, if any, under check.  Calls for a 50 basis point interest rate hike in March have grown louder following the data released early this week, showing that U.S. consumer price inflation rose to an annualized 7.5% in January, the highest level in 40 years. The Fed funds futures are priced for five rate hikes this year.  According to a report by Yahoo, President Joe Biden could issue an executive order next week directing government agencies to study cryptocurrencies and a central bank digital currency (CBDC) and come up with a strategy to regulate digital assets. The President's working group on financial markets is already scrutinizing systemic risks posed by stablecoins ‚Äì in this case, dollar-backed cryptocurrencies.  ""Uncertainty for stablecoins is a short-term negative for cryptos, but overall long-term growth for the crypto-verse will embrace U.S. regulation,"" Moya said.  DIA rallies 30%  DIA, an Ethereum token governing the open-source Web 3 data and oracle platform Decentralized Information Asset (DIA), has been up 30% in the past 24 hours.  The bullish move comes after DIA announced it would include the U.K. FCA-regulated crypto index provider CF Benchmarks' reference rates as feeds in its data offering. CF Benchmarks is one of the leading crypto index providers whose Bitcoin Reference Rate is used by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to settle bitcoin futures and options.  ""ETH and SOL reference rates will be provided to both Ethereum-native and Solana-native developers. The availability of institutional-grade, Benchmark Regulation compliant reference rates will enable secure development of new financial products and services underpinned by resilient and robust methodologies in Web 3,"" DIA said in a blog post published Thursday.  Latest Headlines  US Agencies Seized Around $30M of Crypto Related to NetWalker Ransomware Last Year  Hackers Behind AscendEX Breach Move $1.5M Ether to Uniswap  Smarter Smart Contracts With Artificial Intelligence  CoinGecko's Bobby Ong on the Metaverse  Terra, CEO Do Kwon Ordered to Comply With SEC Subpoena Related to Mirror Protocol Investigation  China Casts Long Shadow Over Hong Kong's Once-Vibrant Crypto Industry  Will Bitcoin Rally After March Rate Hike?  By Omkar Godbole  Bitcoin is just 13 years old with hardly any historical data to look into for clues on how it may perform during the impending Fed tightening cycle, widely expected to begin next month.  However, the dollar and stocks might help in this case. Past data shows the greenback typically peaks after the first Fed rate hike. A strong dollar is generally considered bearish for bitcoin and vice versa.  According to Bloomberg, the S&P 500 has averaged a 9% gain in 12 rate-rising cycles since the 1950s. With increased institutional participation since March 2020, bitcoin has moved in tandem with the stock markets more often than not.  So, bitcoin could regain poise following the March rate hike unless the central bank raises borrowing costs by 50 basis points or more and keeps doors open for four more hikes by the year's end.  According to Dan Morehead, CEO and founder of Pantera Capital, bitcoin could be the best place to park funds during the Fed rate hike cycle.  ""I think our markets will decouple soon. Investors are going to think: bonds are going to get crushed as the Fed goes from the only buyer on Earth to seller. Rising rates will make equities and real estate less attractive. So, where does one invest when both stocks and bonds are falling? (Normally they are negatively correlated.) Blockchain is a very legit place to invest in that world,"" Moorhead said in the newsletter published on Feb. 16.  Gaming Flips DeFi  By Omkar Godbole  Data tracked by CryptoRank show that unique active wallets connected to gaming surpassed those associated with decentralized finance (DeFi) in 2021 and accounted for 49% of the blockchain industry's usage.  ""Gaming has become one of the biggest growth areas in crypto. The first wave of games are play to earn (P2E) like Axie or DeFi Kingdoms because they are easier to deploy, requiring less intense graphics and mechanics,"" Ilan Solot, a partner at the TagusCapital Multi-Strategy Fund, said in an email.  ""The main appeal for P2E is participating in the game‚Äôs economy in some way, so, naturally, many DeFi users (especially yield farmers) would quickly jump on board. There is a lot of overlap,"" Solot added.  While gaming sector is booming and often considered recession proof, the fortunes of gaming tokens and other sub-sector coins remain tied to bitcoin, perhaps due to a lack of education across retail and new professional investors, as Arca's Jeff Dorman pointed out in a blog post published last month.  ""Many digital assets should behave more like consumer staples than profitless tech companies due to the high revenues and cash yields, but the market doesn‚Äôt seem quite ready to draw a distinction between tokens of recession-proof gaming companies (e.g. ,AXS) and high cash flow exchange companies (e.g., FTT, SUSHI) versus protocols with no cash flows (e.g. BTC) or early-stage products with little fee generation (e.g., SOL, AVAX),"" Dorman said.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,"Omkar Godbole, Parikshit Mishra",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/02/18/first-mover-americas-bitcoin-nears-40k-gaming-flips-defi,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f99ab56e73abfa19bdb6f2eedad2cdf5144d81e3-600x234.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Pantera began gathering leaders together in 2014 to encourage the growth of the blockchain system. Pantera aims to focus on the important and exciting areas in the blockchain industry. Investors in the stock and cryptocurrency markets are particularly focused on the Federal Reserve&apos;s potential response to increasing inflation. According to the present logistics, it has hiked up to 7.5 percent this month. Bitcoin and cryptocurrency markets have frequently moved in tandem with stock market patterns; however, Dan Morehead stated in his February 16 newsletter that the Federal Reserves&apos; &apos;major policy U-turn&apos; brunt will be borne by bonds, stocks, and real estate with respect to raising interest rates. Despite the fact that the crypto market has been in decline since late 2021, the CEO believes that digital assets will be the &apos;best place&apos; to store capital throughout the aftermath of the U.S. Federal Reserves&apos; actions. &apos;I think our markets will decouple soon.

The difficulty of mining a block in the Bitcoin network is measured in terms of Bitcoin mining difficulty. It adjusts itself automatically every two weeks. As more miners join the Bitcoin network, the Bitcoin mining difficulty rises; as miners leave the network, the Bitcoin mining difficulty falls. This ideation was created by Satoshi Nakamoto - to mine a block, every ten minutes, in the Bitcoin network no matter the number of miners present in the network. China also plays a major role in the relationship between miners and bitcoin difficulty. Many miners, in May 2021, fled out of China and made both hash rate and mining difficulty drop. The previous mining difficulty all-time high was on May 14 with 25.04 T. Later in July 2021, the year&apos;s lowest mining difficulty was recorded which was 13.67T. On-chain analysis software On February 18, CoinWarz, a cryptocurrency mining calculator, reported that mining difficulty has reached a new high of 27.97 trillion hashes (T). Bitcoin (BTC) has now reached a new all-time high in terms of difficulty for the second time in three weeks. 23 January 2021 reported that the Bitcoin mining difficulty reached 26.7T as the hash rate became 190.71 EH/s (exhashes per second).

Analyzing the movement of the ADA price on a weekly timeframe, we can say that now the cryptocurrency is one step closer to collapse. The prospect of a new fall wave can range from 40% to 60%. Buyers currently have two main problems. The first is low activity near $1.

The seizure is the largest ever related to ransomware, Chainalysis said.  Law enforcers seized just under 720 bitcoins (BTC) and 15.7 monero (XMR), equating to over $29.4 million at today's prices.  NetWalker attackers extorted tens of millions of dollars from businesses and governments in 2020, burrowing into and encrypting victims' computer networks. It followed a ransomware-as-a-service model whereby individual hackers conducted the attacks and then shared the profits with NetWalker.  One such hacker was Sebastien Vachon-Desjardins, who Chainalysis said had netted more than $14 million in bitcoin since February 2018, worth $27 million by January 2021. Earlier this month Vachon-Desjardins was jailed for seven years in Canada after pleading guilty to a number of charges including ""participating in the activities of a criminal organization.""  The news of last year's crypto seizure from Vachon-Desjardins follows shortly after U.S. officials got hold of $3.6 billion worth of bitcoin from the 2016 hack of crypto exchange Bitfinex.

In December, buyers failed to keep the global trend line, which was the beginning of a new powerful fall impulse by almost 50%.

Unfortunately, the trading volumes deny this. https://www.tradingview.com/x/JnPVpmeY/ At first, buyers failed to strictly stop the price at around $95. The DASH price first broke this range and it happened at medium volumes. And the new current growth wave looks rather weak and buyers do not hint at the desire to act. Currently, the positive scenario in the DASH market is the price growth to $145. In all probability, this growth will be as slow as possible and with deep corrections.

42416672,e264UAkMOkEShzxWulWs81,1645172628,Bitcoin Wilts as Russia-Ukraine Tensions Push Gold to 8-Month High,"The wait for the crypto community's supposedly seminal moment when bitcoin (BTC) flips into a risk-off asset continues as the leading digital asset faces selling pressure amid escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine.  Bitcoin fell over 7% to $40,500 on Thursday, registering its largest single-day decline since Jan. 21 as reports of Ukrainian forces and pro-Moscow rebels exchanging fire in eastern Ukraine saw investors ditch risky assets for safe havens like gold.  While gold rose over 1% on Thursday, hitting an eight-month high of $1,902 per ounce, the S&P 500 stock index took a beating along with cryptocurrencies, falling over 2%.  ""Wall Street has gone full de-risking mode and bitcoin is paying the price. Fears over geopolitical concerns and potentially aggressive central bank tightening has cryptos across the board in free fall,"" Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda, said.  ""A month ago, no one wanted to touch gold. Now gold has suddenly become the flavor of the month, now that investors are scrambling for safe havens as geopolitical risks intensify and fears grow that the central banks might go overboard with tightening monetary policy,"" Moya added.  The crypto community has long hailed bitcoin as an asset to hold during economic or geopolitical issues worldwide. However, the narrative has yet to materialize into reality, with the cryptocurrency continuing to move in lockstep with growth-sensitive, risk-on assets like equities.  ""Bitcoin/crypto is acting more like high growth tech assets. Just like Nasdaq is filled with Web 2, it's almost as if the Web 3 narrative has pegged crypto to act similar to the Nasdaq in less certain environments,"" Ben Lilly, a crypto economist at Jarvis Labs, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.  While increased institutional participation since the March 2020 crash has legitimized bitcoin as an asset, it has made the cryptocurrency more sensitive to risk-off/risk-on trends in traditional markets.  ""BTC is caught in broader market crosscurrents right now because of its increased institutional ownership,"" MacroScope, a Twitter feed focused on institutional trading and asset management, tweeted.  Analysts foresee more pain for bitcoin if the geopolitical tensions escalate. ""Bitcoin is the ultimate risky asset, and a Ukraine invasion would keep crypto selling pressure going another 10%-15% over the short term,"" Oanda's Moya said. According to the latest reports, Russia is withdrawing military forces from near Ukraine. The futures tied to the S&P 500 were up 0.5% at press time, while bitcoin was up 0.6% at $40,700.  Some observers expect bitcoin to outperform the yellow metal over the long run. ""Over the full cycle of a sustained bull move in gold, BTC should massively outperform it,"" MacroScope tweeted.  Gold led bitcoin higher in 2020. The yellow metal surged from $1,500 to a new record price of $2,075 in the five months to August 2020. Bitcoin followed suit in the final quarter, moving to fresh lifetime highs above $20,000.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/02/18/bitcoin-wilts-as-russia-ukraine-tensions-push-gold-to-8-month-high,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/989384fbedebd5dd1bf8eebd43121407ba097de5-1678x814.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Will the bulls go underground again? The MANA coin price shows an early reversal in-between the rally to reach the $3.6 resistance zone. The price retraces 8% from $3.35 as the entire crypto market corrects overnight. Will the retracement result in the $3 fallout? Key technical points: The coin price fails to reach the $3.6 zone. The market price is above the 50-day EMA. The 24-hour trading volume in the Decentraland token is $1.26 Billion, indicating a 10% rise.

NYSE&apos;s Foray Into the Metaverse Realm In its filing dated February 10, the world&apos;s largest stock exchange by market cap, NYSE applied for trademarks for several crypto-based products including software for crypto wallets and an online marketplace for &apos;downloadable digital goods authenticated by non-fungible tokens.&apos; Other possibilities listed in the wide-ranging prospectus include software for virtual and augmented reality. NYSE also gave a detailed description to enable financial transactions in cryptocurrencies, digital tokens, crypto tokens, and utility tokens. The exchange further specified that it has no immediate plans to launch cryptocurrency or NFT trading but it regularly considers new products and their impact on its trademarks and protects its intellectual property rights accordingly. This isn&apos;t NYSE&apos;s first foray into the NFT market.

We caught up with with CoinGecko's Bobby Ong, who will appear at Crypto State by CoinDesk, our virtual community event tour, when it stops in Southeast Asia on Feb. 24. The discussion will explore the metaverse and its implications.  The tour is in partnership with Luno, like CoinDesk owned by Digital Currency Group. Register for ""Metaverse: Gimmick or Distributed Innovation?"" here.  CoinDesk: What does the word ‚Äúmetaverse‚Äù mean to you?  Bobby Ong: I like Matthew Bell‚Äôs definition as he has covered it very comprehensively. In his essay, he says the metaverse will be a) persistent, b) synchronous and live, c) without any cap to concurrent users, d) a fully functioning economy, e) an experience that spans both the digital and physical worlds, private and public networks/experiences, and open and closed platforms, and f) offer unprecedented interoperability of data, digital items, assets, content.  What‚Äôs the best way for investors to get exposure to the metaverse right now?  I think the simplest and most passive way for investors to get exposure to the metaverse today is to buy a metaverse-related index product. The one product that comes to my mind is the Metaverse Index (MVI) released by the Index Coop team. This product provides exposure as it holds a series of metaverse tokens such as illuvium (ILV), sandbox (SAND), axie infinity (AXS), decentraland (MANA) and more.

The page that I look at most frequently on CoinGecko is my portfolio page.

Highly recommend you track your coins using our portfolio if you have not done so yet!

I think Meta will have a tough time trying to gain metaverse market share if they are planning on building on a closed ecosystem. Eventually, I think Meta will be forced to embrace the open, decentralized future to garner users.
