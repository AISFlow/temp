42426400,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJN9hh,1434045708,Bitcoin Teen Pleads Guilty Over Providing Support to ISIL,"A teenager who allegedly gave ISIL supporters advice on bitcoin has plead guilty to conspiring to provide material support to the terrorist group.  17-year-old Ali Shukri Amin, from Woodbridge, Virginia, worked as a writer for digital currency news site CoinBrief. He is accused of offering guidance to ISIL (or ISIS) supporters wanting to travel to Syria via Twitter, facing a maximum of 15 years in prison.  Assistant attorney general John P Carlin said in a statement:  ""We are seeing ISIL use social media to reach out from the other side of the world. Their messages are reaching America in an attempt to radicalise, recruit and incite our youth and others to support ISIL's violent causes. This case serves as a wake-up call that ISIL's propaganda and recruitment materials are in your communities and being viewed by your youth.""  The news follows the publication of controversial research by Singapore-based intelligence firm S2T, which claimed a US cell could be using bitcoin to raise funds for the terrorist group.

42426380,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJN65h,1434038441,Max Keiser's Bitcoin Capital Raises $1.6m via Crowdfunding,"Max Keiser's crypto investment fund Bitcoin Capital has closed a $1.6m equity crowdfunding round.  A financial journalist and the host of RT's Keiser Report, Keiser has been an open advocate of cryptocurrencies. He backed his own altcoin, MaxCoin, following its creation by two Bristol University students in early 2014.  Describing itself as ""high risk, high return"", Bitcoin Capital will invest funds in mining, early-stage startups and cryptocurrencies, with daily dividends paid out in bitcoin.  As part of the deal, 684 qualified investors will receive 50% equity in Bitcoin Capital. Alongside Keiser, the fund will be co-managed by Simon Dixon, a former investment banker and co-founder of crowdfunding platform BankToTheFuture, which hosted the campaign.  Dixon detailed the company's plan in an interview with Keiser, saying:  ""The first part of the fund is a way to give faster return to our investors [...] What we want to do is use the power of crypto currencies [...] in order to actually pay daily dividends to our investors for as long as that process [mining] is profitable.""  Mining profitability concerns  Bitcoin Capital's launch comes amid growing concerns about declining profitability for bitcoin miners. With the price remaining stagnant, miner's profits have dipped while their overheads, such as electricity costs, stay the same.  To achieve economies of scale requires a serious amount of money. HaoBTC's multi-petahash facility in the Tibetan mountains runs over 10,000 Antminer s3 units – each worth approximately $130 –resulting in a minimum investment of $1.3m into hardware alone.  Though big players like KnCMiner continue to grow, closing a $15m series B funding round in February, others have been forced out of the market. CEX.io announced the suspension of its cloud mining activities in January, citing lack of profitability.  Speaking to CoinDesk at the time, CIO Jeffrey Smith noted the move was temporary and that operations would resume if bitcoin's price surpassed the $320 mark. At the time of press, bitcoin's price stood at $230.23.

42426382,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJN6Dh,1434027610,OpenBazaar Raises $1 Million for Decentralised Marketplace,"The developers of OpenBazaar, the open-source decentralized marketplace protocol, have received $1m in seed funding.  The project received backing from venture firms Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures, and angel investor and board member William Mougayar.  OpenBazaar  aims to enable broader peer-to-peer e-commerce, free from the privacy and economic concerns attributed to more centralized models, using bitcoin as a medium of exchange.  The announcement comes more than a year after DarkMarket, the proof-of-concept decentralized market on which OpenBazaar is based, won the hackathon at the Bitcoin Expo Toronto in April 2014. OpenBazaar, later forked from DarkMarket, has since released several beta versions, with the most recent, dubbed 'Portobello', launched in late April.  The funding will be used to support several full-time developers, as well as enable the creation of OB1, a new company that will develop services for future OpenBazaar users.  Union Square Ventures managing partner Brad Burnham told CoinDesk his firm became involved with the project in a bid to support continued innovation that utilizes the blockchain, which he said is key to ""opening up markets again"".  Burnham said he sees OpenBazaar serving a critical role in the development of a new kind of shared public data layer that will reduce the commercial barriers that exist between companies and their customers, explaining:  ""There are going to be a few public companies that provide some basic building blocks and we are trying to make some investments in those companies, and we think OpenBazaar is one of them.""  Decentralized commerce  Both Mougayar and Burnham said the development of OpenBazaar and its underlying concept of decentralized commerce is deeply intertwined with the growth of bitcoin and the blockchain itself.  Mougayar, who advises technology startups and is also an investor in ChangeTip, said he has been following the project since DarkMarket won the hackathon in Toronto last year.  ""Open, peer-to-peer commerce is as much about an ideology as it is about a creative implementation of the bitcoin blockchain technology using multi-sigs and Ricardian contracts as the basis,"" he said.  Those backing the project say they don't support the utilization of the technology for illegal trade, a use case cited by some who see OpenBazaar as a way for dark web markets to flourish without any centralized points of failure. Sellers could use the peer-to-peer nature of OpenBazaar to trade directly instead of through a centrally controlled marketplace, thereby avoiding the kinds of operational weaknesses that ultimately led to the downfall of Silk Road.  Burnham acknowledged that the protocol could be used by dark market operators, but stressed the OpenBazaar developers have no interest in supporting such use cases.  ""They certainly won’t be in the business of providing enhanced services to marketplaces that are selling illegal goods,"" he noted.  Burnham pointed to the creation of protocols like HTTP and SMTP as evidence that legitimate use cases can quickly outpace any potentially illegitimate purposes that may arise during the early stage of development.  ""[Protocols are] neither good or bad – they can be used for both. But those particular protocols have proven to be incredibly valuable to society,"" he concluded.

42426387,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJN6Jh,1434016762,Wences Casares: The Bitcoin-Obsessed Serial Entrepreneur,"Wences Casares, founder of bitcoin security company Xapo and serial entrepreneur is ""obsessed"" with bitcoin.  ""I truly believe that it may change the world more than the Internet did. I truly believe that [because of the] 4 billion people who live on cash today. It is the biggest step forward in the democratisation of money we've ever seen,"" he told CoinDesk.  Widely referred to as the digital currency's ""patient zero"" – a term coined by LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman – the entrepreneur is credited with spreading the word about the digital currency throughout Silicon Valley and reticent financiers on Wall Street. A mission which, he said, has drawn laughter from skeptics. ""Bitcoin sounds a little like science fiction at first.""  It seems Casares is used to dealing with technology skeptics. Hailed with launching Argentina's first Internet service provider (ISP), he recalls speaking to the CEO of Telefonica – a Spanish telecommunications giant – about the Internet in the early 1990s, urging the executive to pay attention to the emerging revolutionary technology to little avail.  Although the comparison between the Internet and bitcoin is not new, Casares regurgitates it convincingly, drawing on his own personal experience:  ""Bitcoin is exactly the same thing, but for money. It moves money from anywhere to anywhere, in real-time, for free and no one controls it and no one can stop it.""  Patience is key, he added. ""We don't have to get anxious and think that we have to create some really glamorous fancy use case for bitcoin. A year ago there were five million using it. Today there's about 12 million people using it. It's just growing organically.""  A solution for a real problem  Having grown up in Argentina, the entrepreneur was exposed to an unstable economy, stifled by hyperinflation, currency controls and the confiscation of bank accounts. His family, he said, survived ""all kinds of crazy things, the kind that you never forget"".  As an entrepreneur, Casares set out to help the unbanked, continuing his attempts to integrate technology into financial services. His initial enthusiasm, however, began to flag when he started considering that an attainable solution would not emerge in his lifetime. Then came bitcoin.  ""When I saw bitcoin, I said oh my god, this is the chance. It is going to change the lives of 5 billion people. It make take 10 years, 20 years, but who cares, this is what the Internet took and look at the impact it has had.""  Argentina, he said, is one of the most real-use cases for the digital currency as it is helping solve a real problem. ""What I like about Argentina is that it's very real. People using bitcoin do not know technology, they are not financially savvy. They are every day people using bitcoin, not because they think it's cool or glamorous but because it solves a problem. I think that's really powerful.""  In his opinion, bitcoin may not work in countries like the United States where people trust the fiat currency. ""It [the dollar] is a currency that they feel has served them, their parents and grandparents well. People have credit cards and they can pay online. Why would they want to fix something that is not broken.""  Bitcoin vs blockchain  Casares is openly skeptical about the ongoing – and increasingly popular – blockchain tech trend, which has seen many mainstream financial institutions and prominent figures hail the distributed ledger's disruptive potential while undermining bitcoin as a digital currency.  ""I think that most people who say that do not understand what they're talking about,"" said Casares, adding ""I think that they are trying to be politically correct.""  Back in the day, he explained, executives or business people were reluctant to go on-record to comment on the Internet's promise, in fear of any public backlash if it failed to succeed.  Traditional finance organisations, said Casares, do not want to say anything positive about bitcoin. Instead, they insist on using a very convoluted argument that praises blockchain tech, but dismisses the digital currency. ""It's childish,"" he added.  With regards to banks' incessant desire to innovate and propagate disruptive technology such as the blockchain, Casares dismissed this, saying: ""They are not even dipping their toe.""  A future with bitcoin    A honed businessman, Casares founded Patagon, which quickly established itself as Latin America's first comprehensive Internet financial services portal and expanded its online banking services abroad, to the US, Spain and Germany, and was later purchased for $750m in 2000 by Spanish bank Banco Santander.      Since then, Casares has embarked on various business ventures, all of which he subsequently sold.      When asked if Xapo will be the only startup he'll keep, he said:      ""I want to dedicate the rest of my career to help bitcoin succeed. I want do it from one permanent platform and I want that platform to be Xapo.""              He added: ""I don't need to sell a company, I don't want to and I am more motivated with helping bitcoin succeed than making money or selling a company.""      On the topic of Xapo, the company made the news recently after online identity firm LifeLock – which purchased Casares' previous company Lemon, a digital wallet platform, for $42.6m in December 2013 – named the entrepreneur and his former colleagues in a criminal complaint, alleging contract violations.      The lawsuit, filed in August 2014, alleges breach of contract and fiduciary duties against Casares; Cindy McAdam president and general counsel and Federico Murrone; founder and COO. LifeLock says that Xapo's software and related intellectual property was ""developed by Lemon's employees, in Lemon's facilities, on Lemon's computers, and on Lemon's dime"".      Casares declined to comment on the ongoing suit. These troubles aside, Casares is optimistic about the future and hopes the work he is involved in will have a lasting impact.      ""When I am old and I go back to Patagonia with my grandkids, hopefully they'll ask me what I did with my career and I'll say that I helped a little for bitcoin to succeed. That's my goal,"" he concluded.    Wences image via Big Think  Wences Casares is speaking at Consensus 2015 in New York.
