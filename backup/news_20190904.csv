42403246,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfL2m,1567634423,Rainforest Charity Launches Crypto Appeal to Help Protect Amazon,"A veteran non-profit is embracing the crypto community to fight forest fires in the Amazon.  The Rain Forest Foundation, founded in 1987, announced today a campaign to fight the Brazilian forest fires with the help of the crypto community. Although the foundation has accepted crypto for years—and even developed their own, BitSeed, in 2014--the Brazilian fires has given the Foundation a new impetus for embracing the crypto community.  Deforestation is up 278% from a year ago last July with the number of forest fires doubling between January and August 2018 to 2019, according to the Rain Forest Foundation. The organization is seeking up to $100 million to combat the fires, but did not set a specific funding goal for the crypto appeal.  Speaking with CoinDesk, executive director Suzanne Pelletier said old school philanthropy isn’t making the cut, necessitating new donation and community activity methods. The crypto community’s ability to think outside the box spurred the new campaign.  “[Crypto is] filled with people that are thinking differently and trying to change the rules of the game. It’s so slow and so bureaucratic to raise support from foundations. It’s going to be too late. We don’t have enough time,” Pelletier said.  As of now, the foundation accepts donations in bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin, and bitcoin cash. It's also working with bitcoin donation firm The Giving Block on the project. The foundation is looking for crypto communities to sponsor projects and raise awareness, in addition to donating crypto.  Working with the crypto community isn't all about the funds but the tech, Pelletier said. Smart contract systems, currently being developed with the Regen Network, are one such way the foundation is tracking the foundation's physical work in the jungle. Pelletier said peer-to-peer payments are another innovation the foundation is looking into to bypass traditional banking hurdles.

The grim statistic was reported in the 2018 Software Industry Survey conducted by the Software Policy & Research Institute, which is affiliated with the country's National IT Industry Promotion Agency, a government-funded organization. The document is dated December 2018 but was released on Aug. 26.  ""Only 22.2 percent of those in blockchain have reported sales, indicating that the high interest in the market has not yet led to sales results,"" the report said.  The findings suggest that — by the end of 2018, at least — the much talked about boom in blockchain had yet to materialize. Despite significant interest on the part of the government, and a blockchain 'yes"", crypto 'no' policy, little happened beyond the many announcements made and MoUs signed.  Of the 198 blockchain-focused investments examined in the report, only 44 had achieved any sales from their newly developed offerings.  Most of the companies — 141 of 198 — in the blockchain category in the survey were involved in IT services. But only 16 of those achieved any sales in 2018 - about 11.4 percent. All six in the internet software category recorded sales, while 22 of the 50 IT services companies booked business. The sole game company in the survey reported no business  The results for blockchain were the worst in the survey by far. In comparison, 60.2 percent of companies in cloud computing achieved sales from their new software and services in 2018.  For those involved in so-called big data, the ratio was 56.9 percent, while for those pursing developments in IoT, the success rate was 67.1 percent. For AI-related companies, the rate was 50.0 percent. For those engaged in virtual reality, augmented realty and other related fields, new software generated sales for 68.1 percent of them.  The report also indicates that blockchain was not a significant part of new technology development overall. Most of the action was in other areas. Of companies engaged in new software business, only 8.4 percent were involved in blockchain.  That compares with 43.5 percent involved cloud computing. 27.9 percent in big data and 25 percent in IoT.

According to a statement made by the Bank of the Republic of Burundi, the country’s central bank, the measure was taken as an act of consumer protection.  “These virtual currencies are traded on unregulated online platforms around the world, and their values ​​are highly volatile, resulting in speculative transactions that expose the users of these currencies to potential losses without no possibility of legal recourse in the event of a collapse of their value or in case of closure of these cryptocurrency exchange platform,” the government wrote in a statement.  Because cryptocurrencies are not issued by any central authority, digital assets cannot act as “legal tender.” The general public is directed to “exercise caution” and only make financial transactions through “institutions duly authorized by the Central Bank.”  Included in the ban are remittances made in cryptocurrencies. According to the World Bank, personal remittances received in Burundi represented 1.2 percent of the nation's gross domestic product in 2018.  A senior official at the central bank told Bloomberg some Burundi citizens approached the government after losing money while trading cryptocurrencies. As a recourse, Alfred Nyobewumusi, director of the bank's micro-finance division said crypto trading was banned outright in the country.  Nyobewumusi further stated, “strong measures” will be taken against those that do not follow the law.  It has not been disclosed how many people lost their investments, in what currencies, or on what exchanges. The central bank did not respond to a request for comment by press time.

The listing, announced Wednesday, means New York-based Hydrogen's APIs are now available to nearly half a million Oracle customers to develop applications for banking, investing, savings, insurance and wellness.  Oracle Cloud Marketplace is a leading provider of platform as a service (PaaS) and infrastructure as a service (IaaS) technology. Vendors must pass vetting by Oracle to be allowed entry.  Hydrogen's director of growth, Scott Raspa, told CoinDesk that his startup, coming up on its second birthday in November, distinguishes its product from others with scalability. Subscribers can build multiple systems from the firm’s APIs, including its Hydrogen Molecule product, currently in beta testing, which can be used for customer identification, cross-border money transfers, and tokenizing securities. Molecule is built on top of Hyrdo, which in turn is built on top of ethereum.  Further, Hydrogen says its technology can simplify the creation of lending and financial services that run on blockchains, known as decentralized finance or DeFi.  ""Hydrogen Molecule is like Stripe for DeFi. It is a developer-centric set of APIs and libraries that will be the standard in decentralized finance. DeFi can now be added to any application globally,"" the company told CoinDesk.  Big customer  Founded by twins Michael and Matthew Kane, Hydrogen grew out of their former project, Hedgeable, an investment app geared toward financial laymen. Raspa said the Kane brothers often received requests for an API service with blockchain technology.  Raspa told CoinDesk numerous firms use Hydrogen’s product, including Canada’s TD Bank, which saved months and millions on developing an investment budgeting app through Hydrodgen’s API service.  “Our goal in building this tool was to take the complexity out of the front end and build an easy-to-follow tool for our customers. All the modeling and all the guts of what a planning tool is would sit in the background,” TD Bank's Jacob Matthews recently said on the Tearsheet podcast.

LTC suffered an 8 percent drop in the week ended Sept. 1, having registered 3.17, 15.10, and 5.74 percent losses in the preceding three weeks, according to Bitfinex data.  That is the longest losing streak since August 2018. Back then, the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization had suffered losses in each of the four weeks of August.  Weekly chart  The August 2018's four-week week losing streak saw LTC clock a high and low of $85 and $49, respectively, meaning prices fell by 42 percent.  The latest four-week sell-off brought LTC lower to $62 from $107 – again a 42 percent drop. It is worth noting that the price slide has happened following litecoin's mining reward halving on Aug. 5.  That is hardly surprising as the cryptocurrency had priced in the impending supply cut with a 100 percent price gain in the first three months of this year. Also, it is worth noting that despite the recent drop, LTC is still up 123 percent on a year-to-date basis.  More importantly, LTC is now trading around the 50-week moving average (MA) – a level, which consistently acted as strong support in 19 months before the bullish breakout in March 2017, as seen in the chart below.  LTC's dips to or below the 50-week MA were short-lived throughout the August 2015 to March 2017 period.  The cryptocurrency picked up a strong bid near the key average at $4.09 at the end of March 2017 and rose to a record high of $370 by December 2017.  As of now, LTC is trading around the 50-week MA located at $67.94. If history is a guide, LTC could continue to trade in a sideways manner around the MA line for at least the next few months, before breaking into the next bull market.

Announced Tuesday, the payments giant’s business-to-business global trade unit, Mastercard Track, will provide an access point to Marco Polo’s working capital finance platform, which operates within a $1.5 trillion market, as estimated by the World Trade Organization.  Founded by startups R3 and TradeIX, Marco Polo uses the former's Corda blockchain platform. The network promises real-time connectivity, greater visibility for trading relationships and lower barriers to accessing capital.  Since launching in 2017, the network has attracted participation from major financial institutions such as BNP, Commerzbank and ING. It now has more than 25 members.  Mastercard Track was developed with Microsoft's Azure cloud service and launched in 2018. The platform provides identifying, vetting and onboarding services for more than 210 million registered entities worldwide.  “The scale and reach of Mastercard will complement and enable the large number of financial service providers who have pioneered the formation of the Marco Polo network over the past couple of years,” Daniel Cotti, a managing director at TradeIX, said in a press release.  Still in a pilot phase, Marco Polo has been slowly releasing trade transaction services.

42403237,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfKvt,1567605607,China's Crypto Competitor Is Being Built in a Secret Office with Restricted Access,"The People’s Bank of China (PBoC) is charging full speed ahead with its digital currency plans, hoping to beat Facebook’s Libra to market.  A dedicated team from the central bank’s Digital Currency Research Lab is now developing the system in a closed-door environment, away from the PBoC’s downtown Beijing headquarters, a person close to the bank told CoinDesk.  The team has been working in this separate location since early summer so they could fully concentrate on the project, this person said.  The work has been expedited as Facebook unveiled in June its vision for Libra, a global cryptocurrency to facilitate payments, the source added.  The Libra announcement rattled governments around the world, spurring Congressional hearings in the United States and bold new thinking by central bankers such as Bank of England Governor Mark Carney.  Much about the PBoC’s project remains under wraps, and there have been conflicting accounts about the timetable and the degree of involvement by major Chinese companies.  When launch?  According to a Sept. 4 report by state-owned media outlet China Daily, ""closed-loop testing"" has begun for the central bank digital currency (CBDC) to simulate payment scenarios involving ""some commercial and non-government institutions.""  If things go well, the project could launch sooner than Libra, which is targeting the first half of 2020 for its debut, China Daily said in an earlier report.  Forbes reported last week that China’s big four state-owned commercial banks, as well as fintech giants Alibaba, Tencent, Union Pay, and an unnamed company, will be the first batch of organizations to receive the CBDC. It could be launched as soon as November, Forbes said  The four commercial banking giants are Bank of China, China Construction Bank, Agricultural Bank of China, and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, which is one of the largest banks in the world by total assets.  But hours following Forbes’ report, Chinese publications Tencent News and Sina said the timeline and scope of the eight institutions were “inaccurate speculations,” citing people close to the central bank.  And yet, a second source who is familiar with the PBoC’s CBDC efforts told CoinDesk that organizations mentioned in the Forbes report have indeed participated in the development of the CBDC initiative. But the source would not say whether all or only some of the mentioned institutions will be receiving the state-backed digital yuan upon the launch.  A third person who works for one of the mentioned institutions said there’s such work ongoing inside his organization but it’s unclear what the actual contribution is since the details are confidential due to non-disclosure agreements. The mentioned organizations did not respond to CoinDesk's request for comment.  Regional rollout  Whenever the CBDC launches, the central bank may not roll it out nationwide on Day One.  Chinese state-owned publication Global Times said last week, citing industry sources familiar with the matter, that the system may be launched in Shenzhen first to test the waters. There, local companies including Tencent and state-owned financial institutions are researching technical frameworks to support the development of the CBDC.  The PBoC’s Digital Currency Research Lab previously launched an entity called Shenzhen Fintech Research Institute with Shenzhen’s local government and financial regulator to undertake fintech and digital currency-related projects.  The institute has also been on a hiring spree with job advertisements looking for various technical experts including blockchain architects and cryptography specialists to be based in Shenzhen and Beijing.  The PBoC’s Digital Currency Research Lab has filed more than 50 patent applications to detail the potential design of the state-backed digital yuan.  CoinDesk reported previously that based on the patent filings, the envisioned CBDC may only resemble a cryptocurrency at a surface level as a peer-to-peer transaction system but will strip off most cryptocurrencies’ anonymity and decentralization features.

42403253,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfL9f,1567602032,'Team Satoshi' Is Running Again – This Time for Bitcoin Pioneer Hal Finney,"On Friday, Sept. 6, bitcoiners around the world are vowing to run in memory of the late Hal Finney. Anyone is invited and dozens of the technology's enthusiasts have already pledged to join.  Finney has long been touted as one of the first people to see the promise of bitcoin, long before it had a price and even ardent computer scientists weren't quite sure if the decentralized money would really work in practice or not.  The computer scientist and noted cryptographer ultimately died in August 2014 after a battle with Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a neurogenerative disease that eats away at neurons in the body, leading him to be stuck in a wheelchair for the last few years of his life.  Still, that isn't stopping others from seeking to combine Finney's passions to honor his legacy.  Team Satoshi  , a group who wants people to raise awareness of bitcoin through sport, is throwing this event in his memory because he loved to run. Finney even left a trail of his final runs on Twitter. ""Just got back from 11 mile run – really treasure each one now,"" he tweeted on August 22nd, 2009.  His life partner Fran Finney later pointed out the message was sent just 17 days after he learned he had ALS. She tweeted two weeks later that Sept. 6, 2009 was his ""last real run.""  Ten years later, bitcoin enthusiast Vitus Zeller is organizing this run in his memory, as a part of Team Satoshi. Just last week, he and several others ran, swam, and biked across Europe for bitcoin.  ""I thought it would fit great as a bitcoin and cypherpunk community event to ask enthusiasts to join in for a run on the 10th anniversary of his last real run,"" Zeller said.  Fran Finney told CoinDesk that she plans to participate as well.  ""I am very touched by [the event]. I know Hal would be, too. I have so many wonderful memories of the two of us running!"" she said, adding:  ""I definitely plan to quietly and contemplatively go for a run on Sept. 6, on some of the trails we used to run together.""  Notably, bitcoin developer hire Matt Corallo and lightning developer Rene Pickhardt plan to participate, and a group of bitcoiners is meeting up at a lake in the capital of Switzerland for a 7 to 10km run.  During the event, people can follow along on Twitter and post photos of the run by using the #RunForHalFin hashtag.

In a tweet reposted by Ripple on Tuesday, the new hire, Ron Hammond, announced that he has joined the firm as its new manager of government relations.  Hammond previously served as a legislative assistant for Rep. Warren Davidson (Republican), where he led the drafting of the ""Token Taxonomy Act"" – an attempt to bring in legislation giving cryptocurrencies clearer legal standing in the U.S.  The bill, first introduced last year by Reps. Davidson and Darren Soto and reintroduced in April 2019, seeks to exempt certain cryptocurrencies and other digital assets from federal securities laws. Reps. Josh Gottheimer, Tedd Budd, Scott Perry and Tulsi Gabbard also cosponsored the 2019 version of the bill.  Michelle Bond, Ripple's global head of government relations, welcomed Hammond to the firm on her LinkedIn account, saying:  ""Thrilled to announce Ron William Hammond as Ripple's Government Relations Manager! Ron brings a wealth of legislative and policy experience – excited to have him on board as we continue to work closely with lawmakers, regulators, and partners worldwide!""  Hammond's knowledge of securities legislation may well come in handy for the firm. Ripple has notably been accused in lawsuits of selling unregistered securities via the XRP token that powers one of its banking payments products.  With the U.S. also possibly moving to take a tough stance on crypto regulation, Ripple has also appealed to lawmakers not to stifle innovation by lumping all cryptocurrencies together.  In a July blog post, the firm said in an open letter to Congress:  ""We urge you to support regulation that does not disadvantage U.S. companies using these technologies to innovate responsibly, and classifies digital currencies in a way that recognizes their fundamental differences—not painting them with a broad brush.""

42403256,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfLCc,1567594825,Bitcoin Short of Bull Target Despite Five Days of Price Gains,"View  Bitcoin's five-day winning run, the longest in a month, has neutralized the short-term bearish view. A UTC close above the lower high of $10,956 created on Aug. 20 is needed for a bullish revival.  Volumes picked up on Tuesday, adding credence to Monday's triangle breakout on the daily chart. So, a rise to $10,956 may be on the cards.  The probability of a move above $10,956 would weaken if the prices drop below key the crucial support at $10,286 on the hourly chart. Acceptance below that level could yield a deeper drop into four figures.      Bitcoin (BTC) has charted its longest daily winning run in a month, but is yet to confirm a short-term bullish revival with a move above key resistance near $11,000.  The premier cryptocurrency eked out 2.24 percent gains on Tuesday, having risen by 0.95, 0.15, 1.81, and 6.32 percent on Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday, respectively, according to Bitstamp data.  That five-day winning streak is the longest since early August. Back then, BTC rallied over the seven straight days from July 30 to Aug. 5.  The longest daily winning run of 2019 is the eight-day rising trend observed from July 19 to July 26, which produced a rally from $9,000 to a 17-month high of $13,880.  With the latest five-day upwards climb, BTC has largely recovered its drop from the Aug. 21 high of $10,807 to a one-month low of $9,320 on Aug. 29. The cryptocurrency clocked a high of $10,807 yesterday and was changing hands at $10,570 at time of writing (prices from Bitstamp).  The bounce has neutralized the short-term bearish view put forward by the range breakdown witnessed on Aug. 28 and the outlook would turn bullish if prices print a UTC close above $10,956 (Aug. 20 high), invalidating the lower-highs setup, as discussed yesterday.  The probability of BTC challenging $10,956 has increased in the last 24 hours, according to the technical charts.  Daily chart  BTC jumped 6 percent on Monday, confirming an upside break of a descending triangle pattern, a bullish development.  Monday's move lacked volume support and looked unsustainable. Prices, however, rose to a 13-day high of $10,783 yesterday with buying volume (green bar) hitting the highest level since Aug. 15 – the day BTC charted a quick recovery from $9,467 to levels above $10,000.  That's given the triangle breakout credence and prices could rise to $10,956 in the next day or two.  Supporting the bullish case is the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram's move above zero and an above-50 reading on the relative strength index (RSI). The 5- and 10-day moving averages have also produced a bullish crossover.  A high-volume daily close above $10,956 would open the doors to the next major resistance lined up at $12,000.  Hourly and weekly charts  BTC is trapped in a falling channel on the hourly chart (above left) and is currently bouncing up from the rising trendline support.  An upside breakout – an hourly close above the upper edge of the channel at $10,637 – would imply a resumption of the five-day winning run and further boost the prospects of a move above the bearish lower high of $10,956.  The bullish case, however, would weaken if prices find acceptance below the rising trendline and dive below $10,286 (horizontal support line). That would shift the focus back to the bearish indicators on the weekly chart (above right) and could yield a deeper drop to levels below $10,000.  On the weekly chart, the 5- and 10-week MAs have produced a bearish crossover and the MACD histogram is reporting bearish conditions for the first time since February.

It's also expected to appeal to crypto investors.  Legacy Trust CEO Vincent Chok said:  “We envisage that this will appeal to businesses who are active in the digital assets space, and who want to offer additional benefits to their employees to retain talent and recognise achievement. What better way to drive employee loyalty while allowing valuable staff to participate in the growth of the company and the digital asset space?”  The plan will be funded by either voluntary contributions or deducted directly from an employees salary. The pension will be paid out after retirement of the scheme member, or to beneficiaries in the event of their death.  Legacy Trust said the plan ""addresses various tax concerns for digital assets holders,"" though it did not offer any details.  In March, the firm partnered with hardware wallet maker Ledger to offer “institutional-grade” cryptocurrency custody.

Since becoming an independent democratic nation in 1979, the Republic of the Marshall Islands has used the US dollar as money. Today we are progressing with our plan to issue a sovereign currency in digital form – using blockchain technology.  Last year, we passed the Sovereign Currency Act, declaring our intention to issue a new currency, the Marshallese sovereign (SOV), which we will use alongside the dollar. Issuing a currency is of course the prerogative of any sovereign nation, but what is unprecedented is that we have chosen to issue our sovereign currency using blockchain technology.  We made three key decisions when we chose to issue our currency. First, that the currency would be based on blockchain technology – this is vital for us in the Marshall Islands, for reasons I will outline below. Second, that the growth of our money supply would be predetermined and tamper proof. And, last but not least, that compliance would be baked into the currency protocol itself, while maintaining privacy for individuals.  The advent of blockchain technology has opened up a world of opportunity for small nations like ours. Relying on traditional fiat currency, the Marshall Islands has only fragile links to the wider world of international finance, and compliance is extremely resource intensive. Many of our citizens send or receive money using remittance services, paying fees of up to 10% per transaction. Even simple things like acquiring and installing ATMs become complicated when you’re in the middle of the Pacific Ocean!  But blockchain transactions are fast, simple, and cheap. Blockchain transactions are secure, because they’re replicated throughout a decentralized network. Most importantly, and despite its mathematical and technical complexity, blockchain is practically very simple. The only infrastructure needed for a blockchain-based digital currency is the network itself. We do not need to create a central bank and manage the printing and processing of paper money.  We chose to create a fixed money supply with fixed growth because fiat currencies can be remarkably unstable. For example, the Argentine peso recently fell 15% in a single day, while Venezuela's currency, for all intents and purposes, no longer functions at all. The policies of major central banks are not reassuring, as the gold and bitcoin prices attest. We as governments need to take a more sustainable approach to money, and not treat it as a limitless resource.  Our money supply will grow at a sustainable 4% each year, following Milton Friedman’s k% rule. New SOV will be automatically distributed to the currency holders and the decentralized entities securing the network. This means that we in government cannot modify the money supply, and we cannot manipulate the value of our currency by printing more money.  Finally, our currency must be internationally accepted. Post 9/11, money laundering and financing of terrorism are major threats that the global community is fighting together. But without our own currency, and beholden to existing systems, it is hard for us to contribute much to this fight beyond basic compliance. With a digital currency based on blockchain, we can automate much of the compliance burden and take a proactive role on the international stage.  Every individual using SOV must be identified by an approved verifier of their choice, such as a bank or an exchange. This will close the secrecy and anonymity loopholes exploited by criminals and terrorists. However, it is crucial that individual users should have a reasonable expectation of privacy – specifically, the ability to choose when to disclose your information, what exactly to share, and with whom. We are committed to providing this privacy with SOV.  The Marshall Islands are working closely with international regulatory bodies to ensure SOV meets all compliance requirements and can be fully integrated into the international financial ecosystem. In fact, SOV is being digitally engineered from the ground up to prevent misuse, unlike paper currencies.  For years, the Marshall Islands have been exploring ways to enhance its connectivity to the international financial system. By issuing a currency that is not physically embodied in cash, that can travel the globe instantly, and that is tamper-proof and completely secure, the Marshall Islands will finally be connected to the global financial system on its own terms.  It may seem surprising that the Republic of the Marshall Islands would be issuing a currency based on blockchain technology, but actually it’s just the opposite: the Marshallese people have lived with decentralized systems for hundreds of years. For us, a country of just over 50,000 people spread across more than 1,000 Pacific islands, centralized solutions aren’t just inefficient: they’re completely unworkable. Blockchain has given us the opportunity to finally acquire monetary independence in a way that reflects Marshallese values. We intend to grasp that opportunity, innovatively and responsibly.  Minister Paul will make an announcement around the Marshall Island’s sovereign issuance at Invest: Asia 2019.

Announced Wednesday, the funding will help drive Elliptic’s Asia expansion, which includes a recently opened Singapore office and one in Japan that will open this week.  Tomoyuki Nii, executive officer for overseas investment at SBI Investment, who will be joining Elliptic’s board of directors, told CoinDesk that the Japanese company contributed $10 million to the funding round.  Also participating in the round were AlbionVC and existing investors including SignalFire, Octopus Ventures, and Santander Innoventures. (Ed Lascelles of AlbionVC will also be joining the Elliptic board.)  James Smith, CEO and founder of Elliptic, said Tokyo and Singapore were attractive locations not only because of their vibrant crypto communities but also because of the technologically-advanced regulators in those jurisdictions. Smith told CoinDesk:  “The Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Japanese Financial Services Agency are very well-versed in crypto. Japan has its own licensing scheme for exchanges; I think all that is really key to the growth of crypto because once you set the ground rules, then businesses can engage and innovate.”  Asia and beyond  Elliptic uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to trace and locate suspicious transactions on blockchains. Smith said Elliptic would be used across SBI’s suite of crypto businesses including its exchange, VC Trade, and custody business, and more broadly across SBI’s portfolio of blockchain companies and its banking and financial partners.  “There’s going to be a strong market push together, where we will be working hard with SBI to capture the Japanse market and then the Asian market more broadly,” Smith added.  Founded in 2013, Elliptic previously raised $12 million over five seed and Series A rounds; the last round in December 2017 led by SignalFire raised $5 million.  Beyond Asia, Elliptic’s funding will also be used to develop monitoring services for Facebook’s Libra network and incipient central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).  On the subject of Libra, Smith said: “I think that could be a huge leap forward for the adoption of digital currencies more broadly and we'll ensure that that's supported on our platform.”  XRP factor  As well as building a raft of crypto-facing businesses, SBI Holdings (previously known as Softbank Investment) is the largest external investor in XRP, the native cryptocurrency of the Ripple blockchain system.  SBI has ambitious plans to build an XRP ecosystem in Japan where the coin has a sizable “hardcore [group] of fans,"" according to SBI’s Nii. It’s also one of the reasons Elliptic was attractive to SBI since it happens to be the best blockchain sleuthing firm when it comes to XRP. Nii told CoinDesk:  “The good thing about Elliptic is they can trace XRP – unlike some other anti-money-laundering (AML) platforms. We looked into those companies and actually I think Elliptic's product was the best in terms of AML.”  Smith said that Elliptic is agnostic when it comes to which coins it monitors, but said many customers had asked about XRP, particular as his firm turned its attention to Asia. According to Smith, the Ripple ledger carries a high volume of data on-chain because of the way market makers are built into the system and this leads to lots of information about bids and offers on trades.  “There are huge amounts of data in that blockchain; it's probably the biggest blockchain by data, so much information is recorded on it. It's also used in slightly different ways to some of the other cryptocurrencies, as in there are more financial institutions like SBI who are using it as part of their business operations,” said Smith.  Nii said SBI’s goal is to see XRP showcased as a global cryptocurrency at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, adding:  “At the Tokyo Olympics, a lot of people will come to Japan. They will be shopping and travelling around and they will be able to use XRP in a secure way, protected by a platform like Elliptic.”  Elliptic founder and CEO James Smith at Consensus 2018, image via CoinDesk archives",POSITIVE,XRP,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | XRP,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/09/04/crypto-sleuthing-firm-elliptic-raises-23-million-in-fundraise-led-by-sbi,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c3792c724604d0a0ffded2208d161559ef294d9f-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403243,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfKzp,1567562442,Crypto Firms Serving Netherlands Must Register With Dutch Central Bank,"The Dutch Central Bank is taking a tougher stance on the cryptocurrency industry, citing new European Union anti-money laundering (AML) laws.  Beginning Jan. 10, 2020, companies or persons involved in the conversion of crypto to fiat currencies or offering crypto deposit services will be required to self-register with the De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB), the DNB announced Tuesday.  The order includes firms based outside the Netherlands that are serving Dutch nationals, even via the internet.  ""It is irrelevant whether they are established in the Netherlands,"" a DNB representative said in a Q&A, adding:  ""Also providers that offer such services from another EU member state ... for example via a website, must register, regardless of whether the provider is already registered in that member state.""  DNB says the oversight is to meant to comply with the fifth EU Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD 5), which will also go into effect on Jan. 10, 2020.  The initial registration period will last six months after the January date. Companies that fail to submit registration beforehand could be forced to shut down once the rules go live, the DNB said.  “During these six months you must therefore already comply with the requirements of the law,” the DNB said. ""If, at the time the law comes into force, you have not submitted a request for registration, you must stop your service.""  Further, significant shareholders and directors must also be able to prove their AML ability to a DNB assessment.  Under AMLD 5, member states must issue crypto regulations adhering to the policy before Jan. 10. Interpretation of what regulations must be considered or created falls to each state's discretion, the release says.  In the Netherlands, the DNB will take into account past actions of each company in addition to the “the specific function, the nature, size, complexity and risk profile of the company, and the composition and functioning of the collective.”  Earlier this spring  , the Dutch Financial Criminal Investigative Service shut down coin mixer Bestmixer.io, seizing multiple servers in the Netherlands and Luxembourg.  The DNB did not respond to questions by press time.
