In an interview Wednesday on CoinDesk TV’s ""First Mover,"" when questioned about the future of BitMEX and what the company has learned from past experiences, Hoeptner said he couldn't “go into details on what is happening with U.S. regulators.”      “Discussions need to be had with regulators about crypto assets and blockchain,” he said.      “You have to educate the global market on the possibilities, this is something the crypto industry should have taken on themselves,” he said. Regulations imposed in the past no longer “make sense.”      Hoeptner is also the CEO of 100x Group, which is the holding group for HDR Global Trading Ltd., owner and operator of the BitMEX platform. The platform allows customers to leverage up to 100 times their investment, giving them the opportunity to make a huge profit if the price of the cryptocurrency moves up or lose big if the price drops.      When asked whether 100x plans to continue offering large leverage opportunities, Hoeptner said that it’s not the dominating feature of the product.      “On average of what is traded, the leverages are in the single-digit area,” he said. “A very rare and small extent is used at a high leverage.”      Hoeptner said that entering the U.S. market is not on the horizon and that for now, the exchange is focusing on “living by the rules.""

Bitcoin was trading around $34,000 at press time, but is still down about 1% over the past week. Ether, however, has been outperforming bitcoin and is up about 3% over the past week.    Latest prices    Cryptocurrencies:    Bitcoin (BTC) $34616.7, +1.63%  Ether (ETH) $2364.9, +1.6%    Traditional markets:    S&P 500: 4358.3, +0.34%  Gold: $1802.4, +0.25%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.321%, compared with 1.36% on Tuesday  Ether takes the lead    “We believe Ethereum and its burgeoning ecosystem will be the growth catalyst for the rest of the year,” wrote crypto asset management firm 21Shares in a Tuesday newsletter.      “Recently, ethereum hit a two-week high in anticipation of an upcoming upgrade called EIP 1559 potentially going live on Aug. 4, which will make ethereum a scarce asset by reducing the circulating supply of ethereum at every transaction,” 21Shares wrote.      Goldman Sachs published a report on Tuesday stating that ether’s use cases currently possess the highest “potential,” being the most popular development platform for smart contracts.      Ether is attempting to break above the 50-day moving average for the first time since March. A confirmed breakout would yield further upside towards $2,800 resistance. Similar to bitcoin, ether is consolidating after a volatile sell-off in May.      The chart below shows ether’s outperformance relative to bitcoin and gold this year.    Bitcoin stuck in a choppy range    “Bitcoin continues to trade choppy and though we have seen an upward bias in the last few days it will take some work for BTC to break above the $42,000 mark,'' wrote Pankaj Balani, CEO of Delta Exchange, in an email to CoinDesk.      “Any weakness in the broader markets or reduction in liquidity can cause sharp down moves in bitcoin, and we continue to see this reflected in options data as puts trade at a premium to calls for July and August expiry,” Balani wrote.      Other analysts expect bitcoin to level out as trading volumes continue to drop since the May sell-off. “We expect speculation in the spot and derivatives markets to stabilize for the foreseeable future, which will transpire into lower price swings,” 21Shares wrote.    Institutional interest    Even though trading activity has been relatively quiet over the past month, institutional investors are busy assessing cryptocurrencies as an alternative to traditional assets.      “We have seen more large institutions inquiring about the space, including large banks and asset managers, as well as pension funds and even insurance companies,” wrote Florian Ginez, associate director of quantitative research at WisdomTree, in a Tuesday note.      “Most of these [institutional] actors are still very early in their journey to get the green light to start investing in bitcoin, but this shows large institutions are keeping their eyes open,” Ginez wrote.      The chart below shows a rising 90-day correlation between bitcoin and ether this year. However, bitcoin and ether have become less correlated with the S&P 500, which could offer diversification benefits to traditional investors, albeit with higher volatility.    Ethereum gas price drop    The Ethereum gas price has recently dropped to the lowest level since March 2020, according to crypto analytics firm CoinMetrics.      Though the decline corresponds with ether’s price drop, the downward trend in the gas price started in April, before ether’s price crash when the Ethereum gas limit was raised to roughly 15 million on April 22 and the Ethereum scalability solutions took off, according to CoinMetrics. Meanwhile, Flashbots has been helping to move decentralized finance (DeFi) arbitrage bots, which contributed to the high gas prices, off the Ethereum blockchain.    Altcoin roundup  Coinbase USDC rate: Coinbase, the biggest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, rolled out the new deposit service last week for the dollar-linked stablecoin USDC at a rate of 4%, which is much lower than the 8% rate being offered by other crypto lending platforms. Coinbase’s below-market interest rate might reveal confidence in its own strength – a bet that customers will view the cryptocurrency platform as a safe place to keep their money.  ETH locked in DeFi: The amount of ETH locked in DeFi applications dropped by 11.5% during the second quarter. However, the total dollar value of all crypto assets under management in DeFi apps remained steady over the same time period, which indicates a rise in other asset types such as stablecoins or governance tokens for DeFi collateral and liquidity.

42434789,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPtGZh,1625688989,Argentine Lawmaker Proposes Bill for Businesses to Pay Employees in Crypto,"An Argentine lawmaker wants to let employees receive their salaries in cryptocurrencies.      Congressman José Luis Ramón presented a bill to allow employees and service exporters to receive their full or partial salary in cryptocurrencies on Monday. According to Ramón, the idea behind his project is that “Argentines can strengthen their autonomy and preserve the purchasing power of their remuneration.”      Argentina currently sees its native peso suffer from 50% inflation per year.      “This initiative arises from the need to promote greater autonomy and governance of the salary, without this implying a loss of rights or exposure to situations of abuse within the framework of the employment relationship,” Ramón stated in his Twitter account.      According to a preview published by Ramón, the project defines what Argentina treats as cryptocurrencies and other terms in the crypto market.      In 2019, the government forced service exporters to convert their income from dollars to Argentine pesos through an exchange channel authorized by the Argentine Central Bank, which currently has a conversion rate 78% lower than a different market’s conversion rate, such as one known as a “stock exchange dollar” – dolar bolsa, in Spanish – which allows certain bonds to be purchased in Argentine pesos and sold for U.S. dollars abroad.      ""This project allows self-employed workers who export services abroad to preserve the purchasing power of their remuneration in the process of their entry into the country,"" Ramon stated.      It also claims to clarify what the employer's obligations are in the payment process and details that employees will have the ""absolute"" decision on accepting, revoking or modifying this type of collection.      The employer, in addition, will have to bear the costs of the transfer of cryptocurrencies, according to Ramon's draft, to which CoinDesk had access.      Ramón clarified that his project allows agreeing a payment in pesos equivalent to the pricing of a cryptocurrency or a direct payment in cryptocurrencies.      According to the latest official data, Argentina’s inflation in May was 3.3% and accumulated 21.5% for the year, while year-on-year inflation reached 48.8%.      Argentines faced a devaluation of the peso from $0.02 to $0.006 in just 18 months and an annual inflation rate higher than 40%. They are only permitted to buy up to $200 a month in dollars through official channels with an additional tax of 65% over the official quote.      Because of these restrictions, many Argentines have started to adopt stable cryptocurrencies such as DAI, whose volume has already grown at least sixfold this year, according to information provided by local crypto exchanges SatoshiTango, Decrypto and Ripio.      To avoid the switch to Argentine pesos, many exporters receive their payments in cryptocurrencies.      Bitwage, a platform that converts fiat into crypto, recorded a 300% growth in monthly transaction volume of Argentines during the last year, while it saw a 500% growth in the number of Argentines registered on the platform, the company confirmed to CoinDesk.      Ramón, deputy for the province of Mendoza, belongs to the independent political group Unidad Federal para el Desarrollo (Federal Unity for Development) and has already been in the news for particular behaviors in the chamber, such as when he stirred up a blanket after having approved subsidies for energy consumption.

Tracing firm Elliptic estimated in a blog post that the crypto wallets have received over $7.7 million in total.      “A number of them are deposit addresses at exchanges, while others belong to brokers,” Elliptic co-founder Tom Robinson told CoinDesk.      Of that, $4.1 million is in the USDT stablecoin and an additional $3.4 million is in bitcoin, with relatively meager amounts sprinkled across other coins. Tron's TRX accounts for $165,000, ETH for $51,000 and DOGE for $40,000, according to Elliptic's analysis.      The blockchain-sleuthing firm said the seizure order indicates “that Hamas is now using a range of crypto assets,” an evolution of the terror group’s previous reliance on bitcoin alone.

42434798,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPtGlh,1625687406,The Case for Collaborating on Crypto Regulations,"When the general public thinks about virtual assets, they often also think of crime. Hacking, ransomware, sanctions and darknet marketplaces such as Silk Road and Hydra have all littered the headlines over the years, leading to a generalized view that the virtual asset world is something of a wild west – one that is largely unregulated and bereft of respect or adherence to rules.      In the old west, when a sheriff was unwilling or ill-equipped to reel in cowboys running amok, it was the citizens who assumed the mantle of protecting themselves and their property. And while the contemporary crypto landscape doesn’t call for reckless vigilantism, it does create the chance for crypto companies and their counsel to come together to establish the rules of engagement for the new frontier.    Delphine Forma is chief compliance and risk officer at TAAL Distributed Information Technologies and a board member of the OpenVASP Association.    Worldwide, regulators have started to apply regulation to the cryptosphere – often with good intent but misplaced priorities. They’re armed to regulate the old world of intermediaries rather than the new, trustless protocols enabled by crypto.      Consider the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), which recently updated its guidance to require that virtual assets and virtual asset service providers (VASPs) comply with the same rules as traditional financial institutions. This includes rules concerning licensing or registration, know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) rules, transaction monitoring and reporting, as well as international co-operation agreements.      But many of these regulations were conceived long before the advent of the virtual asset industry, and the reality is that bringing our rulesets in line with a sector evolving as quickly as ours will take time. Until we reach that point, crypto companies and their counsel are tasked with operating in the gray – applying old rules to new fact sets – an approach that leaves ample leeway for both interpretation and creativity.      Personally, as a chief compliance officer in a fast-moving yet still fledgling sector, I see this as an opportunity – an opportunity to shape future market regulations, to influence and organize an emerging industry, as well as to help define the standards and best practices that can serve as the basis for self-regulation in several critical areas, including customer protection, market manipulation, financial crime and data protection.      This opportunity to come together and help each other to stay up to date and compliant, in addition to providing a unique chance to shape the way in which regulation will ultimately be crafted and impact upon the virtual asset industry.      It’s time for the more established blockchain and crypto companies to give back by offering dedicated training delivered by compliance officers to startups that are just beginning their journey and by sharing information on typologies and red flags to better prevent financial crime.      Perhaps more important, by working together we can collectively determine a common approach on how to interpret and adhere to both the old and the new, as we transition towards a brighter digital future.      Collaboration works. I’ve seen it firsthand.    Read more: State of Crypto: Federal Regulations Are Coming Into Focus    When the Swiss regulator issued its guidance on blockchain payments, I met with my peers here in Switzerland to discuss practical solutions on how to comply with the travel rule and what concrete actions and steps that we – both individually and collectively – should take in response.      That same year, we again collaborated in an effort to define standards for a protocol for travel rule compliance. This is how OpenVASP Association was born. I could offer many different stories like this where collaboration was the focal point for a rising tide across the industry here in Switzerland – but in essence, they boil down to simplifying common issues as a collective and deducing shared solutions for the benefit of a sector still largely in its infancy.      That’s collaboration in action.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | REGULATION,Delphine Forma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/07/07/the-case-for-collaborating-on-crypto-regulations,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/094ba13ab309e78fc7381b10573850bafd22a66e-2400x1600.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Founded almost three years ago, Wasabi Wallet pools multiple users’ unspent transactions (UTXOs) into a single Bitcoin transaction using CoinJoin. CoinJoin is a trustless process that makes it difficult for third-party observers, or even participants, to trace funds and it significantly lowers transaction fees. In order to protect the anonymity of its users, Wasabi traffic runs through the Tor network, an online network that focuses on censorship resistance and anonymity, by default.      Wasabi Wallet 2.0 aims to improve the user interface of the wallet as well as introduce a more efficient coinjoin framework, which developers call WabiSabi.    Read more: Wasabi Wallet Is Revamping Its CoinJoin Design to Allow Bitcoin Mixing With Differing Values    “One of the biggest challenges was developing the software for more than just cypherpunks and people very well versed in Bitcoin,” said CTO David Molnar.      “It was difficult to get the developers and contributors to see the bigger picture, that we can only win the privacy war if we expand our vision to include all future Bitcoin users and not just the privacy advocates and cypherpunks.”      While the new UI will allow users to access “pleb-friendly,” frictionless and secure payments via Tor, WabiSabi boasts its own set of upgrades:    Users will no longer need to run coins through multiple coinjoins in order to gain privacy.  There will no longer be a minimum (0.1 BTC) or maximum (7 BTC) denomination when using coinjoins;  There will be improved block space efficiency, allowing more inputs into a single coinjoin transaction. This will lower fees for each user.    Wasabi Wallet 2.0 has no defined launch date; however, the company has committed to and published three milestones:    Wasabi Wallet 2.0 Preview will contain only the most fundamental features and will be used only on the Bitcoin testnet. This will be released in around 6-14 weeks.  Wasabi Wallet 2.0 Release Candidate will include all features and will be available to the public for reviewing and testing. The team will work on this version until ”the quality of the software is sufficient.”  Wasabi Wallet 2.0 Final Release (Series) will be the first version of the 2.0 series and the default when new users download the wallet.

42434785,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPtGRh,1625679619,"Eric Adams, Mayor of All the Bitcoins","Eric Adams will be the next mayor of New York City. The former New York Police Department cop was declared winner of the Democratic primary yesterday, so unless there’s an improbable surge from his Republican opponent, cat rescuer and Guardian Angels founder Curtis Sliwa, Adams will take over from Mayor Bill de Blasio in January following November’s general election.      I live in New York City, and I hate to perpetuate the general media’s East Coast bias, but in this case, a mayoral election really seems to matter outside the city – especially for cryptocurrency businesses and traders. New York has some of the country's most restrictive cryptocurrency rules, the much-bemoaned “Bitlicense.” That’s particularly onerous because New York City is a major financial center, so the 2014 law has hampered crypto offerings by New York City-based entities, and to New York residents.    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    But Adams has been vocally pro-crypto, saying in late June that New York City would become the “center of bitcoins” under his leadership. Adams isn’t nearly as passionate about bitcoins as erstwhile mayoral rival Andrew Yang, and from his slight malapropism it’s a fair guess Adams is not exactly a crypto expert, though he did also speak positively about crypto in 2015.      Instead, Adams’ promise (like his statements in 2015) came in the middle of a much broader endorsement of disruptive innovation. New York City, Adams said, should “become the center of life science, the center of cybersecurity, the center of bitcoins … We’re going to be the center of all the technology.”      In short, Adams seems to be more focused on well-paying jobs and a vital economy than on changes to the status quo of financial regulation. In many ways, this is hugely bullish for the sector, a sign that “crypto” is stealing some limelight from “Silicon Valley” as a synecdoche for innovation and growth. And New Yorkers were eager for that message thanks to an unemployment rate of 10.9% in May, far above the national rate of 5.9%. That’s probably thanks above all to the loss of tourism, which is a huge driver of the New York economy, during the coronavirus pandemic.      It’s also a meaningful signal locally given the 2019 progressive backlash against plans to build an Amazon headquarters in the borough of Queens, which had its justifications but was seen by some as anti-jobs. Adams is more of a centrist than those anti-Amazon activists, and has aimed mostly at appealing to blue-collar New Yorkers. Much of his platform focuses on small business, but the nod to tech is part of that larger promise of more and better jobs.      It’s not as if Adams has much sway on the crypto issue anyway: The Bitlicense was imposed by state legislators in Albany, and the New York mayor generally has a contentious, if not outright hostile, relationship with the state capital. His chances to get any changes on the Bitlicense are close to nil.      So if Adams wants to make New York City more of a “center of bitcoins,” his real options include the kind of programs he pursued as Brooklyn borough president, including investment in STEM programs for local students. It’s an uphill battle to get more hometown kids into the pipeline for the local tech industry, but if any city can pull it off it’s New York, which has some of the country's most well-regarded public secondary schools and universities.      It’s also possible that Adams’ quality-of-life measures could help attract new businesses or individuals to the city. Those include enhanced child-care services and a firm-but-just approach to violent crime, which has been edging up. The timing would certainly be right, given an ongoing outmigration from the San Francisco Bay Area and a historic dip in rents in New York City.      But those are ultimately edge issues – New York’s advantages for crypto or any other business are bigger and longer lasting than any one mayor. That’s made clearest by the comparison to Miami, which has also made a recent push to attract crypto businesses, but has some serious disadvantages in the effort. To pick just one, only 29.8% of Miami-Dade County residents have a bachelor’s degree, according to census data, compared to 37.5% in Brooklyn and 61.3% in Manhattan.      Traditionally, that difference in talent pool has been a determining factor. Businesses hoping to hire the very best people, which usually includes the most innovative companies, are more likely to locate near big talent pools. That’s why despite the hassle of the Bitlicense for companies that move crypto, the city is already the home to important blockchain firms, including Chainalysis, Grayscale and its sister company, CoinDesk.      Of course, that calculus has itself changed dramatically during the pandemic. The new acceptance of work from home (WFH) means companies are more likely to hire employees who don’t live near their headquarters, especially for white-collar tech and information jobs. New York City currently stands to lose as much as $720 million in tax revenue from commuters who aren’t working in the city. So while he may make some efforts to make New York into a friendlier city for crypto, Adams’ most important task will be simply keeping the city a place where people actually want to live.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MINING | REGULATION | TRADING,David Z.

42434800,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPtGph,1625679187,Kraken Casts More Doubt on JPMorgan Call Over Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ‘Unlocks’,"Cryptocurrency exchange Kraken has joined a growing chorus of analysts suggesting that a wave of new Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) shares hitting secondary markets might be good for bitcoin prices.      The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, the world’s largest digital-asset fund, allows institutional investors to gain exposure to bitcoin through shares in the trust, which now holds 654,600 BTC. That’s about 3% of the cryptocurrency’s total supply. (Grayscale is a unit of Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.)      The institutional investors can buy into the fund at its net asset value – essentially, the value of the underlying bitcoin – but they are subject to a lockup period of six months. Because so many investors bought into the trust early this year, many of those lockups are now expiring, meaning more GBTC holders will soon be able to sell their shares on the secondary market.      A widely cited report from the JPMorgan suggested that the GBTC ""unlocks"" might lead to “downward pressure on GBTC prices and on bitcoin markets more generally.” But cryptocurrency analysts and investors, including Amber Group and Arca Funds, have suggested that the GBTC unlockings might actually be good for bitcoin prices.      According to a report from Kraken Intelligence, recent data indicates that close to 40,000 BTC worth of GBTC shares will unlock in July. That works out to about $1.36 billion, based on a bitcoin price of $34,000.      “Despite 40K BTC worth of GBTC shares unlocking in July, market structure suggests that the unlock will not weigh materially on BTC spot markets anytime soon, if at all, like some have claimed,” Kraken Intelligence wrote in the report.      According to regulatory filings, most of the shares that will be unlocked in July are owned by large institutions. Kraken said that those large institutions “presumably bought GBTC shares with BTC to harvest the premium to net asset value (NAV) that the shares were trading at.”      “Whether these buyers of GBTC are market participants who hedge their purchase by selling BTC or are new, natural buyers, will likely determine what impact, if any at all, the sale of GBTC shares could have on the cryptocurrency,” Kraken wrote.      In a note last month, JPMorgan strategists, led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, wrote that the unlocking of the GBTC shares posed a downside risk to bitcoin.      “Selling of GBTC shares exiting the six-month lockup period during June and July has emerged as an additional headwind for bitcoin,” the strategists wrote.

Massad said a bitcoin ETF would enable retail investors to invest in cryptocurrency without having to purchase it and deal with the complexities of custody.

Massad highlighted that crypto exchanges are unregulated and investor protection is weak.  “The SEC does not have the authority to regulate these exchanges because it can only regulate exchanges that trade securities, and bitcoin and the other widely traded tokens are not securities,” Massad wrote.  The regulator could use the ETF approval process to improve transparency and integrity of trading on crypto exchanges, Massad added.  Over the years, there have been numerous applications for a bitcoin ETF, and to date, the SEC has rejected all applications.  Many crypto market participants expect new SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, a former MIT professor who taught classes about bitcoin, to approve a bitcoin ETF later this year.

42434795,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPtGhh,1625669040,Only 4%? Coinbase Rate on USDC Reveals Focus on Crypto Credit Risk,"Coinbase’s below-market interest rate on deposits of the stablecoin USDC might reveal confidence in its own strength – a bet that customers will view the cryptocurrency platform as a safe place to keep their money.      When the biggest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange rolled out the new deposit service last week for the dollar-linked stablecoin USDC, at a rate of 4%, it touted the ability to pay customers “more than 50x the national average of a traditional savings account.”      Coinbase didn’t go out of its way to highlight that other crypto lending platforms are offering depositors higher rates – in the neighborhood of 8%. The crypto lender Celsius, for example, is currently advertising an annualized percentage yield (APY) on USDC deposits of 8.88%.      Asked about the below-market deposit rate, Coinbase pointed to the hazards of lending money to platforms that might be more risky: “We have recently seen the rise of crypto interest accounts that offer attractive rates on customers’ assets,” a Coinbase representative said in an emailed response to questions sent by CoinDesk.      “While the high interest rates are appealing, they can present varying levels of risk,” the representative added. “When you read the full terms and conditions, you may find that your assets are loaned to unidentified third parties and subject to their credit risk, which could result in a total loss of your crypto holdings.”      Such commentary highlights an increasingly relevant question as more cryptocurrency firms try to woo big institutional investors and companies to digital-asset markets with promises of high returns: What is the creditworthiness of the lender that's accepting the deposits, and will it be able to repay them when depositors ask to redeem?    To deposit is to lend    Just as big companies typically pay lower interest rates on bonds than a smaller junk-grade issuer, Coinbase might be betting that it can get away with paying a lower interest rate on deposits because it’s a big, well-known player in the cryptocurrency industry, with a stock that’s publicly traded – meaning it has to publicly disclose financial statements and a welter of information about its risks.      “We don’t know the exact legal structure Coinbase has this wrapped in, but 4% might not be a bad rate for accessing the debt markets if it falls under the camp of an unsecured liability of the company,"" David Grider, lead digital asset strategist at Fundstrat, wrote in his weekly newsletter on June 30. ""But many users will rightfully view Coinbase as a highly creditworthy borrower and find the ability to 'lend to them' attractive.”      Circle, the crypto native financial services firm that powers the USDC stablecoin, also offers an APY of around 4% on its USDC Circle Yield product.      Circle Yield is “an institutional-grade product,” Jeremy Allaire, CEO at Circle, recently said on CoinDesk TV’s ""First Mover.""      “The USDC that is lent out is overcollateralized on our platform, which is very significant,"" he said.      Compound Labs’ newly launched Compound Treasury business offers an APY of around 4% on deposits of U.S. dollars, which are then converted into USDC and invested in Compound's decentralized lending protocol. The Compound Treasury website says the accounts are offered by ""Compound Prime LLC,"" which according to regulatory filings is a company incorporated in Delaware. The accounts are offered in part by the digital asset firm Fireblocks Inc. and Fireblocks LLC, a money-services business, according to the website.    A competitive market    Coinbase’s comparatively low interest rate might be well-timed in terms of the market dynamics: Some cryptocurrency lenders have recently been reducing their deposit rates, partly because the market has cooled from earlier in the year.      BlockFi, Ledn and Matrixport have cut their interest rates on deposits of USDC for July amid changing market conditions, while the rates on top decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols such as dYdX, Aave and yearn.finance are already as low as 0.47%.      BlockFi’s new interest rates for USDC deposits in July are between 5% and 7.5% depending on the size of the deposits. Ledn and Matrixport are in the range of 6.5% to 9.5%.      “The borrowing demand is not great,” Cynthia Wu, head of business development and sales at Hong Kong-based Matrixport, said. With bitcoin’s price “rangebound around $30,000, there’s not much to do.”      The fear with depositing tokens to a lending platform is that the company might run into trouble. The accounts aren’t backed by Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. insurance, as is the case with savings deposits at a U.S. bank.    What could go wrong?    As Grider wrote, the risks are plentiful: “If the lenders’ assets become impaired somehow during a sell-off where liquidated collateral doesn’t cover loans issued, or during a hack lose funds, or due to the default of an uncollateralized counterparty, or due to improper management – users can lose a substantial portion of their funds, since these types of institutions are not regulated like banks.”      CoinDesk reported in June that the cryptocurrency custodian Prime Trust had cut its contract with Celsius, citing “red flags.” A person familiar with the situation, who did not want to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter, said Prime Trust’s risk team was concerned about Celsius’ strategy of “endlessly rehypothecating assets.”      A Celsius spokesperson told CoinDesk that the company has “never rehypothecated” New York residents’ crypto assets.      Under Celsius’ terms of service, the company also holds assets for customers in Texas and Washington state. Celsius “may lend, sell, pledge, hypothecate, assign, invest, use, commingle or otherwise dispose of assets and Eligible Digital Assets to counterparties or hold the Eligible Digital Assets with counterparties, and we will use our best commercial and operational efforts to prevent losses,” according to the terms.      In early June, Celsius announced that it had invested more than $200 million in mining equipment and other investments.    Yield generation and sustainability    Other crypto lenders, still providing relatively higher APYs for their USDC deposits such as Nexo and Voyager Digital – with APYs of 12% and 9%, respectively – say their higher rates are justified by how they manage depositors’ funds.      “There are, naturally, moments when we have slightly more funds earning interest,” Antoni Trenchev, co-founder and managing partner of Nexo, said in an email response via a representative. “In these situations, we engage in market-neutral trading strategies to generate yields.”      Trenchev predicted that Coinbase’s entry to the USDC yield-earning products would eventually push “subpar” platforms out of the market.      “This process is already becoming evident,"" Trenchev said. ""Unsustainable services are slowly losing traction.”      “At Voyager, we conduct proper due diligence and risk mitigation analysis before we loan out any assets,” Steve Ehrlich, Voyager’s CEO and co-founder, said via a representative. “Voyager only loans out assets to highly vetted financial institutions that are regulatory compliant and well-capitalized, each with a trusted base of counterparties.”    Read more: BlockFi Rate Cut on Bitcoin Deposits Leaves Rivals Scratching Heads",NEUTRAL,USDC,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | USDC,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/07/07/only-4-coinbase-rate-on-usdc-reveals-focus-on-crypto-credit-risk,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9b68b2be86450333b23340d1dc1ca1377083f2fc-1362x884.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Ethereum’s limited throughput and mercurial gas fees have prompted many developers and users alike to turn to layer 2 solutions like Polygon, which offers faster transactions and cheaper fees – 500 times cheaper in some cases, according to Alchemy Product Manager Mike Garland.      Polygon has attracted a number of leading projects in recent months, including decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms Aave, Kyber Network and others.

42434784,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPtGLh,1625662855,"Ethereum-Based Shyft Network Launches, Aims for FATF-Compliant DeFi","The Shyft Network, a platform designed to help cryptocurrency firms comply with anti-money laundering (AML) rules, has launched its main public blockchain system.      Combining elements of Ethereum and Bitcoin, the Shyft Network is an open base-layer platform that houses decentralized identity applications, compliant cryptocurrency transactions and tools to make decentralized finance (DeFi) palatable to regulators, without compromising DeFi's open appeal.      Alongside Wednesday’s mainnet launch is the unveiling of the Shyft Federation, a diverse group of 21 entities, from core crypto development teams to large financial institutions, that will run nodes on the Shyft Network and ensure it has a decentralized architecture from the get-go.      Regulation of cryptocurrency is inescapable. The Shyft project helps crypto companies meet the identity and data sharing requirements of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a global anti-money laundering group, but with the least amount of centralized trusted authority, akin to how blockchains already work.      “A lot of projects are taking a kind of progressive decentralisation approach,” Shyft co-founder Joseph Weinberg said in an interview. “But we are saying this needs to be hardened, ready for primetime, and come with really good censorship resistance across the infrastructure from day one.”    Read more: CoinMarketCap, Animoca Join Huobi’s Public Blockchain as Validators    The Shyft Federation consists of 21 private Tor nodes (referring to “the onion router,” a layered system designed to protect privacy), run by companies, organizations and even a sovereign government (Weinberg wouldn’t disclose which country) that perform a function similar to mining a blockchain. Named Federation members include CoinShares, BitFury, ChainSafe and Fabric Labs.      Under the hood, Shyft runs a modified version of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), a kind of software rulebook that governs the changing state of the blockchain that is followed by all the nodes on the network. In the case of Shyft, a proof-of-authority consensus system is operated by the federation of nodes, with all the relaying done inside Tor to protect against things like denial-of-service attacks, Weinberg explained.    Decentralized SWIFT    In legacy finance, centralized technology such as SWIFT exists to collect counterparty information and route payments. (Blockchains were not designed to require any identity information for routing payments on-chain, which means there is no way to determine counterparty risk.)      Shyft’s Veriscope application, a system of smart contracts running on top of the network’s base fabric, creates a counterparty discovery and coordination layer for crypto finance, Weinberg said. Veriscope is designed to satisfy the data-sharing requirements of FATF’s “travel rule,” but without sacrificing the core pillars of decentralization and open innovation, he said.    Read more: Shyft Debuts ‘Decentralized Version of SWIFT’ for FATF ‘Travel Rule’    In addition to hosting the Veriscope travel rule product, the now-live Shyft mainnet, will be home to a national identity system for Bermuda built with the country’s government, and also a set of smart contracts to help regulators accept and work with DeFi.    KYC and composability    The problem encountered when throwing a lot of ""know your customer"" (KYC) at a DeFi platform is that it ""denatures"" all that’s interesting about the platform, Weinberg pointed out.      “The moment you add KYC, you break composability,” he said, referring to the idea that DeFi projects can easily build atop each other.      To solve for that, Shyft offers an on-chain KYC rules engine that can be customized so that, for example, a KYC policy from one institution can be made available across many institutions at once, or pre-defined rules can be created around particular institutional liquidity pools and users can choose to opt in, Weinberg said.      “So we can basically start to re-architect composability,” Weinberg said, adding:    “In the future there will be all these institutional pools, things like Aave Pro, and the next piece will be, how do we connect all of them together so that we can recreate that experience of transitive liquidity?”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/07/07/ethereum-based-shyft-network-launches-aims-for-fatf-compliant-defi,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/301038958cb7748d26d003c276fb1827c7c3dcb4-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The name is a reference to the kind of paint. ""I think crypto investing is still an art and not a science,"" Egan said in an interview with CoinDesk.      Egan has raised $55 million from an array of funds and investors, including Cendana, a fund-of-funds; Accomplice, his former employer; Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk’s parent company; the founders of Bison Trails, the crypto staking company acquired by Coinbase; and others.      The fund is far smaller than new war chests from Andreessen Horowitz and Blockchain Capital but represents perhaps a more refined approach to helping crypto projects thrive.      Egan said founders have become much more clear in how they want investors to help, including in strategy, growing the community and promoting their ideas. While working on his own for now, the plan is to use the $55 million to ""build an entire firm entirely focused on helping founders accomplish their vision.""      Acrylic will aim to be among the first checks for very new projects, which he describes as ""inception capital.""

He’s on the lookout for the very first applications that cobble those primitives together. He wants to make equity investments in companies that are making cryptocurrency and blockchain technology accessible to the wider public.

The Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office indicted Lee on Tuesday, but didn't take him into custody.      According to an investigation report released by prosecutors, Lee allegedly swindled $100 million from Kim Byung Gun, chairman of BK Group and founder of a line of cosmetic surgery clinics, during a deal to negotiate Kim’s acquisition of Bithumb Holdings.      Lee asked for $100 million upfront as a “contract fee” from Kim, according to the report. In return, Lee promised to list the BXA token on Bithumb’s crypto exchange. The BXA token is issued by the Blockchain Exchange Alliance, which was formed by Kim and a consortium affiliated with BK Group in December 2018.      BK Group, of which Kim is sole owner, is nominally based in Singapore and is part of a corporate empire that started off as a cosmetic surgery clinic in Seoul. BK stands for “Beauty Korea.”      Lee allegedly told Kim that he could pay the remaining acquisition costs using money made through the BXA token listing. The idea was for Kim to profit from selling BXA tokens on Bithumb and then use that money to pay for the acquisition of Bithumb. Kim originally agreed to pay $400 million for a 50% stake in Bithumb Holdings.      The BXA token was never listed on Bithumb. Prosecutors are claiming that Lee never had any intention to list BXA on Bithumb and that the promise to list the token was merely a ploy to get quick cash from Kim and defraud investors.    Read more: South Korean Banks to ‘Review’ Partnerships With Crypto Exchanges    Lee managed to secure 8 billion won ($7 million) from more than 50 investors for the BXA project. He also pre-sold around 30 billion won ($26.4 million) in BXA tokens on the promise that the tokens would be listed on Bithumb. Those investors ended up suing both Lee and Kim for fraud in March 2020, but charges against Kim have since been dropped.      Buyers of the pre-sold BXA tokens filed their own suit against Lee and Kim in April , but charges Kim in that case have also been dropped.      Police investigators have determined that Kim, too, is a victim of fraud perpetrated by Lee.      Prosecutors have stated that they decided not to take Lee into custody because he has been ""cooperative in all investigations"" and that he has forfeited 70% of the aforementioned $100 million to the state.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,Felix Im,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/07/07/south-korean-prosecutors-indict-former-bithumb-chairman-in-100m-fraud-probe,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/85208d1b1dc8d028937c7b83e5254b320cc91b75-1312x656.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434802,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPtGth,1625657400,Valid Points: The Fate of Ethereum Miners When There’s Nothing Left to Mine,"This week, we continue the conversation about Ethereum miners and how they’re preparing for changes to the reward dynamics of the network. Also, we take a look at what other asset types are popularly used on decentralized finance (DeFi) applications beyond ether (ETH).      Welcome to another edition of Valid Points.    This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk's weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum 2.0 and its sweeping impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to Valid Points here.  Pulse check: ETH locked in DeFi  Read more: Ethereum 2.0 Explained in 4 Easy Metrics    The amount of ETH locked in DeFi applications declined 11.5% during the second quarter. Notably, the total dollar value of all crypto assets under management in DeFi apps remained steady over the same time period, which indicates a rise in other asset types such as stablecoins or governance tokens for DeFi collateral and liquidity.      In particular, the number of tokenized bitcoin created on Ethereum has been on a steady rise since the start of this year. As of Tuesday, there are more than 250,000 tokens backed by BTC, collectively worth roughly $8.6 billion at the time of writing and representing about 1.2% of total bitcoin supply.      While there are several protocols issuing bitcoin-backed stablecoins, the most popular one, responsible for over three-quarters of BTC supply on Ethereum, is Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC).      WBTC leverages a technology known as “atomic swaps” to facilitate cross-chain cryptocurrency trades. Users on Ethereum can request new WBTC tokens from certified “merchants” after undergoing necessary anti-money-laundering and know-your-customer (AML/KYC) identification procedures. New mints and burns of WBTC are tracked publicly through the blockchain, as is the amount of BTC backing these tokens 1:1 on Bitcoin.      Speaking to the growing volume of tokenized bitcoin in DeFi, Denis Vinokourov, head of research at Synergia Capital, said in an interview with CoinDesk in June, “It shows the hunt-for-yield trade is nowhere near the exhaustion mark and also underlines the growing comfort, as well as a sense of security, that wrapping bitcoin is a safe method in earning yield on assets, be that by retail or more professional market participants.”    New frontiers: Mining after The Merge    The Merge is one of two upcoming code changes on Ethereum that is expected to radically change network monetary policy and reward dynamics. It seeks to reduce the energy consumption of Ethereum by an estimated 99.95%. The other, Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559, is aimed at improving the transparency and efficiency of Ethereum’s fee market.      Last week, we discussed miners' perspectives on EIP 1559. While EIP 1559 is the more imminent upgrade slated for activation on the network early next month, its impact on miner revenue and profitability is minor in comparison with The Merge upgrade, according to Igor Stadnyk, the CEO of Ethereum mining pool Mineral.      “Basically, the current EIP is not a huge reduction [to rewards]. A huge reduction was from five to three ether. A huge reduction was from three to two ether,” Stadnyk said in a phone interview with CoinDesk.      Stadnyk is referring to changes that protocol developers have activated in the past on Ethereum to curb monetary inflation by reducing block subsidy rewards. Block subsidies are a fixed amount of ether awarded to miners for every block they successfully find and append to the blockchain. After The Merge, block subsidies will once again be reduced, only this time from 2 ETH to zero.    When there’s nothing left to mine    Once Ethereum merges with the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain, mining on the network will become obsolete. For miners, there will be no block subsidies, no transaction fees and certainly no miner extractable value (MEV). Revenue from transaction fees and MEV will instead be awarded to users who contribute to network security by staking their coin holdings in increments of 32 ETH.      These users, also called “validator node operators,” will most consistently be rewarded on Ethereum in the form of interest on their staked ether. For validator node operators actively running software on Eth 2.0 today, their estimated annual percentage return (APR) for a single 32 ETH deposit is between 6% and 7%.      For Ethereum miner Brian Lee, those returns aren’t a convincing reason to make the switch from mining to validating post-Merge, given that he would likely have to sell some of his bitcoin holdings in order to have enough ether to stake. Lee’s long-term bets are on bitcoin becoming “a better store for wealth” than ether because of the experimental and frequently changing roadmap of Ethereum.      “So I’m thinking maybe I’ll switch to [mining] Ethereum Classic,” Lee said during a phone interview with CoinDesk. “There’s a ton of coins out there. I think a lot of guys I talked to [are] thinking about going to Ravencoin after Ethereum merges.”    Finding a new home    As the world’s second-largest blockchain by market capitalization, Ethereum is the most profitable cryptocurrency to mine on graphics processing unit (GPU) devices. These devices are also frequently used for video gaming applications. GPUs, unlike application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) devices that dominate the Bitcoin blockchain, can be repurposed for different tasks and computations.      Michael D. Carter, the host of cryptocurrency mining YouTube channel BitsBeTrippin, told CoinDesk in a phone interview that according to his calculations, if all Ethereum GPU miners were to move over to Ravencoin, the price of the coin would have to appreciate roughly 10 times in order for miners to remain profitable.      To Carter’s mind, the more likely scenario post-Merge is that miners end up splitting their computational energy, also called hashrate, across multiple different coins that support GPU mining and stay in business by spreading out to several new blockchain networks.      “You’re going to see network discovery and you’re going to get buzz around other networks naturally because people are going to want to know: Where are the miners going to be pointing their hashrate? Is there anything as profitable? What’s the value propositions of these other networks?” Carter said.      And it won’t just be miners doing network analysis and profitability projections post-Merge for mining alternatives to Ethereum.      Wolfgang Spraul, director of operations at Linzhi, a cryptocurrency mining hardware manufacturing company that builds Ethereum ASICs, told CoinDesk in an email, “If nobody on Ethereum is left using Ethash-PoW, [Ethereum’s mining algorithm], we will work with Ethereum Classic. And if no one there wants to use Ethash-PoW any longer, we will work with smaller coins like Ubiq.”      At this stage in the game with The Merge estimated by developers to be ready for activation early next year, mining pools such as 2Miners say it’s “too early to announce anything” concrete.      Plus, Carter adds, there’s still lots of work to be done on the protocol development side for The Merge; as such, the Ethereum mining community will want to keep a close eye and stay involved in the development process.      “We’re all investors and have aligned interests with regards to ETH succeeding, so it’s a bit counterintuitive to torch that to the ground [prematurely],” Carter said. “Let’s get through [EIP 1559] and then let’s get ... back to The Merge.”    Validated takes  Lending rates and trade volume on DeFi applications have dropped significantly over the past few months. TAKEAWAY: Daily DEX volume declined 55% from May to June, while three-month interest rates for the stablecoin USDC on Aave, the largest decentralized lending platform by total value locked, has declined from a high of over 10% to less than 4% over the same period."". User growth for DeFi apps, however, has stayed relatively steady, growing 12% this past month. (Blog post, Glassnode)  Jim Cramer, host of CNBC TV show ""Mad Money,” announced he’s investing in ether again after selling nearly all of his bitcoin holdings. TAKEAWAY: Cramer announced he had sold “nearly all” of his bitcoin amid concerns over China’s crackdown on bitcoin mining and is turning to ether as an alternative crypto investment. The CNBC host said he bought more ether after bitcoin stabilized at around $30,000, adding that he likes Ethereum ""because … it’s more of a currency.” (Article, Business Insider)  Big Four accounting firm EY has published code for a new layer 2 scaling system to help battle increasing transaction costs on the Ethereum blockchain. TAKEAWAY: EY’s project, Nightfall 3, builds upon a privacy protocol on Ethereum that the firm “open-sourced” back in May 2019. Nightfall 3 combines the use of zero knowledge proofs (ZKPs) and optimistic rollups for efficient transaction verification. The code is available in the public domain on GitHub for anyone to access. EY global blockchain leader Paul Brody said this was done intentionally to help “speed up enterprise adoption” of Ethereum. (Article, CoinDesk)  A review of Ethereum 2.0 validator efficiency, showed the median validator is 98% effective at earning the maximum amount of rewards possible from the protocol. TAKEAWAY: The median validator is receiving 98% of its possible rewards, while no single validator reached 100% efficiency. The review shows that the majority of validator node operators are competent and can hardly improve upon current performance. (Blog Post, Pintail)  A block number has been proposed for activation of the London hard fork upgrade on Ethereum. TAKEAWAY: A GitHub pull request to lock in the release of London at block number 12965000 was submitted by Ethereum Foundation’s Tim Beiko.

The proposal comes after two successful activations of the hard fork upgrade on Ethereum test networks Ropsten and Goerli, with a third testnet release scheduled for sometime today on the Rinkeby network.

The billion-dollar mark isn’t entirely made up of consumers spending cryptocurrency. Some transactions are tied to fiat accounts but result in crypto rewards; some are indeed crypto transactions. The payments giant didn't provide a breakdown.      It’s the latest outcome from Visa’s partnerships with more than 50 crypto firms that have launched cards with the payment giant. The company’s crypto card program is part of a larger push that Visa is making to merge the crypto world with traditional banks that includes adding stablecoins to Visa’s payments network and plugging banks into cryptocurrency buy and sell features.      “We think the first piece of this is being the bridge between the crypto wallets and our existing network of merchants,” Cuy Sheffield, the head of crypto at Visa, told CoinDesk in an interview, adding:    “Then the next part is making it easier for our clients to issue and interact with those cards with things like being able to settle USDC. Then we’re starting to spend a lot of time around how Visa can be a bridge between our existing network of financial institutions and the crypto ecosystem.”  Read more: Visa Settles USDC Transaction on Ethereum, Plans Rollout to Partners    Visa powers both cards that allow consumers to easily convert crypto to fiat and spend it as well as cards that allow them to spend fiat and earn crypto as rewards.      Crypto lender BlockFi’s crypto rewards credit card is an example of the latter. It launched for the public on Tuesday with users getting 1.5% back in bitcoin on every transaction among other benefits. FTX will be an example of the former, as it joins the Visa Fast Track Program and launches a crypto card of its own, Visa also announced on Wednesday.

Bollinger bandwidth, a measure of volatility calculated by dividing the spread between the Bollinger bands by the 20-day average of the cryptocurrency's price, has declined to a 2 1/2-month low of 0.15.  The cryptocurrency saw big moves in December and April after the bandwidth fell to 0.15.  Bollinger bands are volatility bands placed two standard deviations either side of the 20-day average of price.  Bitcoin dropped from $60,000 to $48,000 after the Bollinger bandwidth dipped to 0.15 in mid-April.  A similar reading in December paved the way for a bullish breakout from the multi-week price consolidation below $20,000.  The cryptocurrency saw big moves during the 2017 bull run each time the bandwidth narrowed to 0.15.  Moves signaled by Bollinger bandwidth are direction-agnostic, as history shows. It means the anticipated change can be bullish or bearish.  The forthcoming Grayscale unlockings and blockchain data pointing to renewed buying by wealthy investors indicate that this time the move is likely to be bullish.  The upside is expected to gather steam above the 50-day moving average (MA) resistance, currently at $36,000.  ""We expect buyers to step in above the 50-day MA,"" Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, said in a weekly research note published Monday. ""A breakout above the 50-day MA would indicate a test of $44,000-$45,000 resistance.""  A move below $30,000 could bring deeper losses, she said, indicating that is a less likely outcome.  While concerns of an early scaling back of stimulus by the Federal Reserve pose a downside risk, the minutes of the Fed's June meeting scheduled for release at 18:00 UTC Wednesday are unlikely to be as hawkish as the June policy statement.  ""Between weaker U.S. data and the Fed's desire to temper hawkish bets, the Fed minutes could sound more cautious and balanced than the FOMC statement and Fed projections,"" BK Asset Management's Kathy Lien said, according to FXStreet.  According to some analysts, bitcoin digested most of the negative news during the mid-May sell-off from $58,000 to $30,000. As such, the downside, if any, appears limited.

42434755,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPtA7h,1625644800,Binance Said to Be Hiring ‘UK Version of Brian Brooks’,"Binance is attempting to hire a former regulator or government official in the U.K. in order to lend the brand some compliance clout as global regulatory pressure mounts on the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange operator, according to two people familiar with the plans.      Binance is looking to hire “a U.K. version of Brian Brooks,” one of the people told CoinDesk, referring to the well-regarded former head of the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) who was brought in to run Binance.US in April of this year.      The search for a respected former regulator to represent Binance's interests in the U.K. follows an announcement last month by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which said that Binance was not allowed to conduct any regulated activities in the country. As a result of the FCA's action, British bank Barclays said earlier this week it was blocking customers from using its debit and credit cards to make payments to Binance.       The exchange operator's regulatory issues aren't limited to the U.K. Regulators from Japan to the Cayman Islands have announced actions ranging from simply saying the exchange operator is not welcome to operate in their country to, in Thailand's case, a criminal complaint. Over in the U.S., Bloomberg in May reported Binance was under investigation by federal agencies, including the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Binance had not been accused of any wrongdoing at that time, Bloomberg said.      In response, Binance has been busy bolstering its compliance efforts and making sure people know it's doing so, making a flurry of announcements just this week. On Tuesday the firm said it named former California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation head Manuel Alvarez to the BinanceUS arm headed by Brooks.      Less than 24 hours later, the exchange operator announced it's hired a new director of compliance, Jonathan Farnell, who joined from eToro, where he served in senior compliance roles. The exchange also published an open letter from the company's CEO that welcomed increased regulation in the space and highlighted Binance's compliance efforts even as while admitting the exchange operator has made some missteps along the way.      ""Binance has grown very quickly and we haven't always got everything exactly right, but we are learning and improving every day,"" CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao said in the letter.      According to LinkedIn, the company's newly announced head of compliance, Farnell, has been in his new position for the past three months but the firm did not announce him immediately due to internal policies, a spokesperson said. The spokesperson added that long-serving U.K. head of compliance Lynn McConnell’s role is unaffected by Farnell’s arrival.
