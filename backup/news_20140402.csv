42377103,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6y5lv,1396474322,"Congressional Hearing Explores Costs, Benefits of Small Business Bitcoin Use","The US House of Representatives committee on small business held a hearing on 2nd April to discuss the growing use of bitcoin by the country's small business owners (SMBs), and the pros and cons that using this technology as a payment option offers the demographic.  Entitled 'Bitcoin: Examining the Benefits and Risks for Small Business', a panel of experts spoke about the benefits and costs of the use of bitcoin by SMBs, while also touching on hot topics like Silk Road and the recent IRS decision on the tax treatment of digital currencies.  Committee Chairman Sam Graves noted in his opening remarks that a great deal of uncertainty remains for small businesses thinking about accepting bitcoin as a form of payment, but that the hearing was meant to increase information about the topic.  Explained Graves:  ""We hope that by providing information about bitcoin, small businesses will be in a better position to know whether adopting bitcoin as a payment system might be a way for small businesses to gain more customers. This hearing will also inform [Congress] Members as we consider implications of policies affecting the use of virtual currency.""  In addition, he cited the collapse of Japan-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox and the prevalence of digital black markets which accept bitcoin as barriers for widespread adoption.  Overall, Graves struck a cautious tone for the hearing that was echoed by its panel of experts.  Bitcoin's benefits  Jerry Brito  , a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, suggested that the use of bitcoins can help SMBs avoid certain types of payment fraud that can result in significant repercussions, including the loss of access to card networks.  Further, he said that businesses can tap into potential new markets simply because they can accept transactions from regions that are not included in current global payment networks.  Still, Brito noted that volatility remains a key barrier to adoption, but that he believes the technical aspects of bitcoin do not lend themselves to the currency's now-infamous price swings.  Said Brito:  ""There is nothing inherent in bitcoin's design that makes it naturally volatile. Its volatility is likely attributable to the fact that it is a new currency, still in the process of discovering its stable price. Additionally, as a nascent currency, it is very thinly traded and as a result a single large-enough trade can affect the exchange price substantially.""  Bitcoin's risks  Capital markets and risk management expert Mark T. Williams of Boston University's Finance Department pointed out that bitcoin's position as a payment system – as well as its price – is determined largely by current users.  Should these parties decide to move away from accepting virtual currency, ""bitcoin [would] become worthless,"" Williams said.  He also said that, compared to other risky investments worldwide, bitcoin poses a much bigger threat to SMBs who lack the capital or infrastructure to withstand potential losses. Williams said:  ""It could be argued that small businesses that blindly accept bitcoin are not actually in commerce but are in the high-risk speculative trading business.""  Williams, known for his often inflammatory critiques of bitcoin, went on to say that bitcoin is perhaps better used by Wall Street trading firms that have experienced staffs that can handle the associated risk.  IRS ruling  Later in the hearing, both Williams and Brito voiced support for the IRS decision to designate virtual currencies as a type of property for tax treatment.  Brito noted that the IRS looked at the characteristics of bitcoin and judged it as more of a commodity compared to a currency. Looking ahead, he suggested that Congress and federal regulators could create a special tax category for virtual currencies that takes into consideration the extraordinary aspects of bitcoin.  Adam White, Director of Business Development and sales at Coinbase, and L. Michael Couvillion, Associate Professor of Economics at Plymouth State University's College of Business Administration, also addressed the committee.

42377094,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6y5fd,1396471773,Bank of Montreal Open to Rekindling Partnerships with Bitcoin Businesses,"The Bank of Montreal, one of Canada's 'Big Five' banks and the fourth largest in the country, issued new statements on 1st April suggesting that it may be open to working with bitcoin businesses again, provided it receives regulatory clarity from the nation's lawmakers.  The comments were made by CEO Bill Downe as part of an interview at Bank of Montreal's annual general meeting in Toronto this week.  Speaking to his company  , Downe said:  ""If you wanted a Swiss franc transaction or a Japanese yen transaction or a US dollar transaction, we can do that for you. If bitcoin [can be] a reliable medium of exchange, then at that point in the future, we would be able to [conduct business] with bitcoin.""  The comments are particularly noteworthy, however, given that Bank of Montreal abruptly cut ties with Vancouver-based bitcoin exchange Cointrader in February.  This decision, according to Cointrader, was part of a larger move by Bank of Montreal to end relations with all of the bitcoin businesses it served. At the time, Bank of Montreal did not comment publicly as to whether it had plans to freeze all of its bitcoin customer accounts.  Past bitcoin relationships  While the news has been positioned as if Bank of Montreal is looking to perhaps enter the bitcoin market, talks with major Canadian bitcoin businesses reveal it already has a history of working in the sector, one that changed earlier this year amid increasingly harsh government rhetoric.  A spokesperson for Toronto-based bitcoin exchange Vault of Satoshi told CoinDesk that it is no longer working with Bank of Montreal, though it said the bank was ""nothing short of fantastic"" while they were in business together.  Said the representative:  ""While we were working with the Bank of Montreal, they changed their stance on bitcoin related-business recently and decided to halt their operations in that field until there is further regulation; not much unlike our decision to temporarily withdraw our US operations.""  A representative from Cointrader indicated that the recent statements from the Bank of Montreal CEO were consistent with responses it received from the banking provider:  ""They wanted to wait for clarification on regulation. But, the problem is, how long does that take? It could take years.""  He added that he believes Bank of Montreal is no longer working with bitcoin businesses, but that at one point, it was the go-to bank for such services.  Regulation in Canada  Notably, the news follows a report last week from The Ottawa Citizen, which stated that the latest version of Canada's 2014 Federal Budget Implementation Act included new directives regarding digital currencies.  The budget act, if passed would require ""dealers of virtual currencies, such as Bitcoin, to report suspicious transactions, or those over $10,000, to a government watchdog"".  Canada has been rumoured to be working on regulating digital currencies, however, Finance Minister Jim Flaherty, the official who was perhaps most active publicly on this front, resigned on 18th March.  Promising signs  Despite the tough talk on the regulatory front, Canada's digital currency community has seen some encouraging signs recently that may signal less aggressive regulation will be forthcoming. For example, on 26th March, Vault of Satoshi received its full money services license.  Furthermore, the local industry is showing it has been able to innovate even in the face of challenges.  Vault of Satoshi announced its coin-to-coin trading system on 2nd April, which allows users to trade altcoins directly without first converting to litecoin or bitcoin, while PocketPOS launched a new merchant-friendly point-of-sale tool meant to increase merchant adoption of bitcoin.

42377102,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6y5oR,1396466855,"Chinese Bitcoin Exchanges OKCoin, FXBTC Report New Deposit Freezes","Following on the heels of the news that China-based bitcoin exchange BTC38 would suspend fiat-to-digital currency trading, rival Chinese exchanges OKCoin and FXBTC have received official notices from financial partners notifying them that certain accounts will be terminated.  The new announcements are the latest indication that China's central bank, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), may be following through on its decision to more actively enforce prior rulings related to how domestic financial service providers can interact with the bitcoin exchanges.  For example, while OKCoin was contacted by its third-party processor, FXBTC has been contacted by commercial banking providers.  China previously banned third-party payment services from dealing with bitcoin exchanges this past December. However, its domestic bitcoin exchanges had found a workaround for this issue by accepting payment into corporate accounts.  A new report from The Financial Times has suggested that the PBOC is now looking to close this loophole.  Notifications received  OKCoin revealed via its website that it had been contacted by one of its third-party payment processors, and that as a result, it will stop servicing deposits via prepaid card. Debit cards and yuan withdrawals, however, are not affected.  FXBTC's situation at press time was perhaps more dire. It posted an emergency notification on its website noting that it has received word from commercial banking partners who are looking to terminate certain accounts.  The exchange indicated that it would stop debit-card deposits as of 3rd April, and temporarily halt withdrawals after Sunday, 6th April. As of press time, however, it said its third-party processing channel – operated by Tencent's TenPay – was still active.  However, another Chinese exchange, Huobi, reported that it has not received official notification that any of its accounts were affected.  Still no official notice  Together with the day's earlier announcement from BTC38, the reports suggest that the PBOC may be pressuring the country's commercial banks and payment companies to close bitcoin trading accounts.  Earlier reports had suggested that all accounts would need to be shut down by 15th April. However, the PBOC has yet to make an official announcement regarding any changes in policy.  This official notice may be unlikely, however, as BTC China CEO Bobby Lee has indicated that the PBOC is simply following a ""stricter interpretation of the written rules"" regarding bitcoin and digital currencies.  Reactions and price implications  Reaction to the news on reddit was still sceptical, with many indicating that the announcements don't actually confirm that the PBOC will be looking to enforce the broad crackdown that has been suggested.  As of press time, the price of bitcoin on the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) was down 8.41% on the news, having fallen $40 from the day's opening total of $478.  Prices in China were affected similarly, according to the CoinDesk CNY BPI, which at press time was down 7.25% from the day's open of ¥2,861 at ¥2,653.74.  Additional reporting provided by Rui Ma.

42374513,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvlCXb,1396465692,Robocoin Machine Heats Up Competition Between London's Bitcoin ATMs,"A two-way Robocoin bitcoin ATM has just landed on the shores of England, thanks to the efforts of Global Bitcoin ATM, a UK-based company. Located at Worldwide Connection, an Internet cafe in Holborn, central London, it is the first Robocoin machine in Europe and the first two-way ATM in the UK capital.  Getting it here wasn’t the easiest process, though, says Global Bitcoin ATM’s co-founder Jean Paul. It took the company over four months to order, receive and ship the machine across the pond.  Said Paul:  “We thought it was a great business idea. We wondered, ‘Is anyone is doing that? No they’re not? Let’s go!’ So we scraped together some money and ordered a machine. And then we’ve had a long, long wait for delivery.”  Paul made the initial order in December, hoping to be the first team to bring a bitcoin ATM to the UK, but FutureCoin’s Joel Raziel beat them to it, launching a Lamassu machine last month. That machine was installed at a trendy bar in London’s Shoreditch area.  The Old Shoreditch Station Cafe had already been accepting bitcoin for drinks and coffee when Raziel decided it was the perfect place for his ATM.  “I wanted my ATM to be more than just a cash-taking functional machinery stuck in an exchange office or an airport,” said Raziel.  He explained:     Raziel's ATM has been live since early March and sees roughly 10 transactions per day.  Competition heats up  While the Lamassu did enjoy being the London’s lone wolf for a brief spell, it now has to contend with some serious competition from its Robocoin rival. Lamassu is a great option for those people who want their bitcoin instantly – just scan your QR code, pop in your cash and receive your bitcoin in your digital wallet.  The Robocoin machine is a little more demanding, featuring a palm scanner to identify the user and regulate their daily transaction limit. However, it’s also two-way, which could prove to be a big advantage for Paul and his team. Said Paul:  “We decided to go with RoboCoin because it's two-way. We know there’ll be a demand for selling your bitcoin and we wanted a machine that [...] people can just know that if they are short of money they can sell their bitcoin.”  He also emphasized that the machine’s anti-money laundering (AML) and 'know your customer' (KYC) features attracted them to the product. The Robocoin machine was funded by Lebanese investor Antoun Toubia, who was given the honours of cutting the ribbon off the machine for his fiscal input.  📷  An excited crowd gathered to use the machine at its launch this afternoon, although not everyone was impressed with the lengthy registration process. Simon Dixon from Bank to the Future was the first person to use the ATM. After he successfully registered, he purchased bitcoin worth £10, he said.  Bitcoin boost  Global Bitcoin ATM said it will charge a 7% commission on all transactions via the Robocoin machine. Until now, Raziel had been trading at 8%, but, following the arrival of the competition, he plans to lower that rate to 5% starting next week. He is, however, excited to welcome more competition because it will be good for the entire bitcoin ecosystem.  Explained Raziel:  “We’re very excited about the new ATM competition in London. I think one ATM can slip through the public net, but with several ATMs all across the city, I think it’ll do very well for all our businesses.”  Meanwhile, a third player is going to enter this competition later this month. SatoshiPoint aims to install its first bitcoin ATM at Nin Com Souphttp://www.nincomsoup.co.uk/%E2%80%8E within Old Street tube station. The restaurant itself will also start accepting bitcoin around the same time.

42377093,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6y5d7,1396462407,"Bitcoin Commodity Exchange CEX.io Imposes Trading Fee, Prepares for USD","The CEX.io bitcoin commodity exchange is to introduce a trading fee within the next two weeks.  The fee will be introduced in two stages: initially a fixed commission of 0.2%, which will be dropped in favour of a flexible fee of 0.2-0.5% after an initial period.  The company says its fee implementation is aligned with its wider monetisation strategy, which will include the introduction of new trading pairs, including BTC/USD and USD/GHS. New scrypt mining services are on the way too.  The first step, the introduction of a 0.2% fixed commission, will apply to all buy/sell transactions and will last one month.  After the month is up, CEX.io will introduce the ongoing flexible fee, which will vary for each user, and will be calculated based on the user's 30-day trading history.  Each transaction will be conducted with a commission. The exchange will post all relevant details on its Trade Fee' page, which has yet to go live.  Necessary move  CEX.io admits that the introduction of a new fee will move it ""toward the way other bitcoin exchanges operate,"" but insists the move is necessary.  Said the company:  ""CEX.io is currently preparing the necessary foundation for the introduction of US dollars on its platform. Without any doubt, this will be an incredible and awaited advancement for the users, who will be able to, for instance, buy bitcoin mining power and withdraw funds in the currency they are used to right on CEX.IO without the necessity to convert cryptocurrencies somewhere else.""  This process is not as straightforward as it might seem. CEX.io points out that the introduction of fiat support will necessitate significant investment and that some legislative issues need to be resolved. In addition, it will require more effort on the part of CEX.io staff.  “Surely, we understand that some of our users may be dissatisfied with the mandatory trade fee,"" said CEX.io spokesman Jeffrey Smith. ""However, considering all the pros and cons, we are confident that the possible negative reaction will be totally offset by adding USD to the list of our trading pairs, and some promising upgrades related to scrypt mining.”  Scrypt mining plans  The reference to scrypt mining is intriguing. CEX.io built its business around powerful SHA-256 ASIC mining rigs, which are used to mine bitcoin. There are increasing numbers of scrypt ASICs coming to market in the near future, and players like Alpha Technology and KnCMiner have recently made some encouraging announcements.  The extent of CEX.io's commitment to scrypt miners is not yet known, but the advent of fast and efficient scrypt ASICs is bound to change the scrypt mining landscape. Furthermore, the fact that much of that power is likely to end up centralised and controlled by CEX.io and other services might cause some backlash.  Last month, CEX.io started offering scrypt mining on GHash.io, allowing miners to connect their rigs to GHash.io. So far, scrypt cloud mining is still off the table, but the company has said it plans to introduce this at a later date – probably after the first scrypt ASICs start shipping.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | MINING | TRADING,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/04/02/bitcoin-commodity-exchange-cexio-imposes-trading-fee-prepares-for-usd,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/09f57a4c8ec622273ffdfaf1ecf19416fa8cd6de-1131x583.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377105,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6y5sD,1396458708,Fitch: Regulation Could Rob Bitcoin of its Low-Cost Appeal,"Global credit rating agency Fitch Ratings believes bitcoin is still too small to affect traditional payment systems and national currencies. The agency's Why Forum published its findings in a report on bitcoin, dubbed 'Sizing up Bitcoin’.  The report points out that bitcoin transactions in February 2014 averaged a meagre $68m per day. Despite a tenfold increase year-on-year, bitcoin's average daily transaction volume pales in comparison to Western Union and PayPal. The two payment processors averaged $225m and $492m per day in 2013.  Fitch examined bitcoin's potential role in the financial markets from three different perspectives: as a payment system, an asset and a currency.  Credit Card comparison  Fitch also found bitcoin's transaction volumes to be practically negligible when compared to major credit card companies.  Visa and MasterCard averaged $19bn and $11bn per day in 2013 respectively. In contrast, bitcoin is simply off the chart.  What's more, Fitch points out that bitcoin's transaction volume also has to be put into perspective, due to its huge price appreciation last year. The price went up, along with the overall volume, but the actual number of transactions did not grow at nearly the same pace.  ""In other words, the average size of a bitcoin transaction (in dollar terms) rose significantly, while the amount of transactions per day remained much more stable. From February 2013 to February 2014, the average size of each transaction rose from about $100 to roughly $1,000,"" Fitch said.  Risky investment  Looking at bitcoin from an investment perspective, Fitch found that bitcoin's price volatility resembles an investment rather than a currency.  ""There is no asset class the same as bitcoin, but comparing its price swings to other currencies and commodities can put the volatility in context,"" Fitch concluded.  ""From a trading perspective, bitcoin transaction volumes relative to the stock of outstanding bitcoins resemble those of equity securities.""  Regulatory ambiguity is another risk brought up by Fitch. The firm points out that regulatory attitudes vary from country to country, but authorities in most countries have issued warnings and informed consumers and investors of the risks posed by digital currencies.  In addition to the standard list of warnings which includes money laundering, tax fraud and illegal transactions, bitcoin's tax status appears to be a much bigger concern. Taxation, in addition to regulation could quickly render bitcoin unappealing.  Fitch came to an ominous and rather obvious conclusion:  ""The future of digital currencies will partially depend on the way public concerns are addressed. It is possible that, if the use of bitcoin were to be regulated as tightly as the use of conventional currency, bitcoin’s appeal as a low-cost means of exchange would decrease significantly.""  Bitcoin as a currency  Bitcoin's market cap, or its size as a currency measured by M1 is insignificant compared to national currencies. Bitcoin is smaller than Guatemala's Quetzal, with a capitalization of $6.75bn in late February. Bitcoin is even smaller today, with a market cap of just $5.6bn.  ""So far bitcoin is mainly used between private individuals. There are, however, a number of companies that have begun to accept bitcoin as a form of payment. The majority of these companies immediately transfer their bitcoin into local conventional currency in order to avoid significant currency risk due to the price instability of bitcoin. The current price instability is a shortcoming of bitcoin as a standalone currency,"" the firm pointed out.  Fitch concluded that much of bitcoin's appeal stems from its pseudo anonymity, including people interested in illicit activities and privacy-minded individuals. Another factor is bitcoin's ease of use and it independent nature.  The firm also touched on some altcoins such as litecoin and peercoin, but it concluded that most of them are based on the same principle and technology as bitcoin, but they tend to offer different features.  Curiously, 'Sizing up Bitcoin' ends with next to no conclusion. The report outlines the basics and brings up numerous challenges, which are debated by bitcoin advocates and detractors on a daily basis.  The takeaway appears to be simple: it all depends on regulators. If bitcoin operators are forced to undergo tight regulatory oversight, the regulatory burden could render bitcoin's low-friction network less competitive compared to traditional payment systems. Bitcoin faces the same challenge when it comes to low-cost remittances.  On the other hand, the added cost would to some extent be offset by more stability and long-term security which is necessary for mainstream adoption. As is the norm in the world of bitcoin, regulation it is a catch-22 and a delicate balancing act.

With the announcement, PayStand also revealed $1m in new investment as part of its initial seed-funding round.  Founded in 2009, PayStand aims to be a multi-payment gateway that eliminates merchant transaction fees, in part by supporting digital currency acceptance.  Said PayStand in its official announcement:  ""PayStand is the first and only payments service to easily allow bitcoin and other digital [currencies] as well as more traditional payments all at the same time and eliminates merchant transaction fees with a unique 'payments-as-a-service' model.""  The Santa Cruz startup boasts an easy setup process and flexible commitments for merchants who want to test the waters with something new. The company notes its service ""does not require any extra hosting accounts, payment processors, merchant accounts, programming [or] order management software"".  Notably, the news comes as more major payments tech startups are embracing bitcoin.  Within the last two weeks, web and mobile payments provider Stripe and mobile point-of-sale (mPOS) industry leader Square have both revealed new bitcoin initiatives.  Digital currency roots  Jeremy Almond, PayStand's CEO, has indicated that the idea for his company grew out of his own investing and experiments with digital currencies.  However, although he was enthusiastic about the potential of bitcoin and its alternatives, he chose to incorporate additional services into PayStand, believing standalone solutions would not be widely adopted.  Even so, Almond is understanding of the big-picture implications of digital currencies, telling TechCrunch:  ""We believe that the process of money movement is going through a massive evolution, and our goal is to support this broadly.""  How PayStand works  With PayStand, online merchants pay a monthly fee for the payment software, thereby avoiding transaction fees associated with its more traditional payment options. Merchants do not pay any added costs on bitcoin transactions.  Likewise, consumers enjoy a one-click payment process, meaning they don't experience the added friction imposed by passwords and other security methods.  Unlike merchant processors such as BitPay or Coinbase, however, PayStand users who want to accept bitcoin need to first set up a bitcoin wallet address. Merchants can then have bitcoin deposited to their personal wallets or sent to an exchange to be converted into fiat currencies, reports say.  Perhaps most notably, the company states on its website that bitcoin acceptance may be part of further services in digital currency space, as it calls bitcoin just ""the first digital currency in line for our eCash payment option"".",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/04/02/paystand-reveals-1-million-in-funding-and-announces-bitcoin-support,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c79e49dcdce4c9ac4d199afa3d5602cd87823c3c-1121x689.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The posting  seemingly confirms earlier reports that the PBOC would seek to tighten its enforcement of earlier guidance issued in December, thereby blocking its domestic banks from working with digital currency companies.  Further, the release corroborates recent statements by BTC China CEO Bobby Lee, who has suggested that the PBOC has been seeking to implement a ""stricter interpretation"" of its past ruling.

There are no government-denominated currency trading pairs on the exchange. At least, not yet.  Cryptsy  regularly exceeds 2,300 BTC in volume on a 24-hour basis. That makes it the largest crypto-to-crypto exchange, at which people routinely trade altcoins for bitcoin, and vice versa.  So, where did the idea of a cryptocurrency-only altcoin exchange come from? How does Cryptsy decide to add new coins? And will the company take compliance seriously when it adds fiat into its enormous mix of digital currencies?  CoinDesk sat down with Paul Vernon, CEO and founder of the exchange, to find out.  The accidental exchange  Vernon started the exchange because of the demand that arose from mining various altcoins.  He started a number of mining pools for alternative cryptocurrencies, first with litecoin, then with feathercoin and so on and so forth. Vernon eventually amassed a host of different pools, mining a numerous array of altcoins.  Said Vernon:  ""I had like 20 pools I was running. And people had all these various coins that you couldn’t trade anywhere.""  Vernon was accruing fees in coins associated with running each pool. The problem was, there wasn't an exchange for him to sell many of these cryptocurrencies. So the next logical step was to start one.  ""Initially [the exchange] was just for those users. I probably had a couple thousand users in those pools. And it was just going to be a small thing for the users of the pools so they could trade,"" he said.  ""It organically grew into something much larger.""  Cryptsy now has over 200,000 users registered and over 70,000 are active, having logged in within the past seven days, according to Vernon.  Voting for altcoins  Vernon says that, for a time, Cryptsy just added coins that looked technically sound from a source code perspective. Now, however, the exchange is using a voting system to introduce new cryptocurrency trading pairs.  Iceland-based Auroracoin was an example of this process. Said Vernon:  ""Auroracoin was one of the first coins that we chose from the voting list, where people can vote on coins.""  The system is a mix of incentivized voting ballots. Every user gets a free vote for a coin. Also, users can spend Cryptsy points, which are accumulated through trading on the exchange.  Voting with bitcoin donations is also another method for Cryptsy's users to voice an opinion on which altcoins should be added. User input is important to this process being open:  ""We have to listen to the majority; try to get a sense of what people like. I wanted to add some transparency of how we added coins.""  Coins with volume  Adding new altcoins for trading can be exciting for Cryptsy's users, but Vernon says that sometimes doing so can cause problems.  One coin that unexpectedly caused issues was dogecoin, where trading volume jumped immediately on the new Cryptsy DOGE/BTC trading pair. Said Vernon:  ""When I initially added [dogecoin], I had no idea the kind of volume it was going to have. And I’ve actually had to swap out wallets because the wallet got so huge, like 2.5 GB.""  At the time, the Cryptsy dogecoin wallet got so large so quickly that withdrawals and deposits were briefly delayed.  Vernon has also noticed relatively high trading volume for something called devcoin, which is a foundation that pays developers to create things:  ""Devcoin gets quite a bit of volume. It’s one that’s been around for quite some time. We get people who have received the coins, and they exchange them for bitcoin.""  Pre-mining principles  In the early days of altcoins, many were pre-mined in order for the developer to reap the financial rewards if a coin should become successful.  Charlie Lee's creation of litecoin changed that. Lee believed there needed to be a silver to bitcoin's gold, and when he created litecoin, he didn't pre-mine it.  Said Vernon:  ""Well, originally it was one of those kind of things that turned you off, the word ‘pre-mined’. You’re like, I don’t want anything to do with it.""  Cryptsy's stance is that, if the pre-mining is carried out not to benefit the developer, but to benefit something else, it's acceptable.  Auroracoin is an example of that, with coins being pre-mined for free distribution to Icelandic citizens, although that coin's distribution allocation has negatively affected its price.  Said Vernon:  ""Maybe we shouldn’t even call it pre-mine, just because of the word. Maybe we should call it pre-allocation.""  Significant proof  The fact that Cryptsy currently has 157 cryptocurrency trading pairs means that Vernon has a lot of experience in comparing different types of cryptocurrencies.  Because of this, the idea of a proof-of-work algorithm that actually works to solve a problem is of interest to him:  ""Primecoin is pretty cool. They’ve actually found quite a few primes that nobody knew about. But what are we going to do with those [prime numbers], I don’t know.""  So far, Vernon hasn't come across a proof-of-work system other than primecoin that does something substantial from a computational standpoint. But he has thought of something that might be useful for humanity:  ""Protein folding. That would be something that would be really nice to have: a proof of work where the work is really doing something, solving problems,"" he said.  Vernon pointed out with the hashing power that the Bitcoin network has, it could be considered, ""the biggest supercomputer in the world.""  Preparing for fiat  Cryptsy does not deal with fiat money, but it will sometime in the future. Vernon started the exchange without the use of government-backed money as a method of exchange because it was an easier business to get off the ground:  ""Mainly I didn’t want to get into fiat because of the regulatory issues. And so [cryptocurrency-to-cryptocurrency] seemed like a good entry point.""  Crypsty has been working through a lengthy process to be in a position to accept fiat money on its platform, but it is taking a lot of time.  Some of the delay is down to working with accountants that have to get used to the concept of cryptocurrencies; some of it is because Vernon wants to set an example of diligence:  ""It’s a long process, and we want to make sure we do it right. It’s not something I want to do without knowing that the way we do it is the right way.""  With this in mind, he has sent four of his employees to become CAMS certified. This is a credential offered by the Association of Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialists that, the associations says, ""denotes proven knowledge in the detection and prevention of money laundering"".  Vernon says that he expects Cryptsy to be one of the only exchanges to have that number of people with CAMS certification on its staff.  Crypto-to-crypto was a way to get Cryptsy off the ground, but Vernon wants to set an example for how to do things the right way to ensure long-term stability of the exchange.  He discusses this at conferences, and was a on a panel at San Francisco's recent CoinSummit event talking about alternative cryptocurrencies.  Vernon shares the government's uneasiness about decentralized money being used in nefarious ways. As he sums it up:  ""Our concern is, and the government’s concern is, money laundering. So we need to kind of be the poster children of how to do [compliance] correctly. So I’m not going to launch [a fiat currency option] until I’m ready to be on the poster.""",NEUTRAL,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MINING | TRADING,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/04/02/cryptsy-founder-paul-vernon-on-worthy-altcoins-pre-mining-and-compliance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/53cb579bf0682518a043ac50255513de1a03c87d-562x384.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377097,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6y5i9,1396444511,Hemant Taneja: Quality Entrepreneurs are Driving Bitcoin Investment,"A partner at the $3bn venture capital fund General Catalyst Partners, Hemant Taneja focuses on investing in early-stage technology companies. He is a board member of Stripe and ZenPayroll, among other companies.  Last week, GC joined with Breyer Capital and Accel Partners to lead a $17m Series B investment in Circle Internet Financial, a digital currency company with services for both consumers and businesses. General Catalyst had already led a $9m Series A investment in Circle with Accel last fall.  CoinDesk caught up with Taneja at CoinSummit in San Francisco to find out more about his investment plans, what it will take for bitcoin to hit the mainstream and why the space is so popular with venture capitalists.  CoinDesk: What are your goals for investing in the bitcoin space?  Hemant Taneja: We don't think about bitcoin per se as a space and say 'we have to have 10 investments in that space'. We think about the small and medium business sector in general, and what are the tools that create a level playing field for small businesses to be competitive in the 21st century. The same sophistication that FedEx provides from a logistics perspective – what are the payments systems that provide that level of sophistication that large companies enjoy?  That's the angle that we come at it from in terms of payments. Some of our investments in the small business area are Bigcommerce, which is an e-commerce software platform, and Stripe, which is a payments platform.  Circle fits in that regard: how do you create a platform so that businesses can safely accept payments in bitcoin and not be subject to the volatility that exists in the currency, for example, and how can consumers safely store bitcoins and transact with them? That's the core premise of the Circle investment.  We think about other areas in this space. We think about: how does this infrastructure really become a trusted platform, something that's accepted by the banks? If you're accepting bitcoin, how do you get your financials audited, for example? We think a lot about: what are the tools required so this currency can be fully functioning from a business perspective?  How far away are we from that point?  If you think about the current global financial systems, the dollar is today's bitcoin. That's what everything gets pegged to due to volatility. Systems are expensive, there are fees, there are foreign exchange issues, there are lots of issues, but it's a regulated currency. There is credit that exists around dollars, derivatives exist, financial instruments. All that infrastructure needs to be created when it comes to bitcoin.  This is not going to be an overnight success. This is something where you have to have a long term point of view. Start by using it for areas where, even in the absence of regulation, they can start to provide advantages to businesses. Then over time the various federal agencies will put their stakes in the ground and it will become a deeper part of our system. But that's a decade or more, that's not the next two years.  I think you'll see some regulation in the next 12 to 24 months, as various states put a stake in the ground and the Federal Reserve starts to have a point of view as to how they want to regulate it. But it will be an evolving structure.  There's this whole debate over how much should bitcoin be regulated. At Circle we have the philosophy that financial instruments should be regulated, so we want to work with regulators and bring them along.  That's what will accelerate the more pervasive use of bitcoin, the creation of financial instruments. The broader use case for bitcoin will only happen once states have come along.  Can you explain in more detail what Circle does?  Circle is a two-sided platform. On one side, how do you provide the consumer with the ability to safely buy, store and use bitcoins? On the other side, how do you help merchants accept bitcoin without having to deal with the volatility and the other issues that pop up?  So it's an alternative to CoinBase for the consumer, and to BitPay for merchants?  Yes, it's an alternative wallet from a consumer perspective and it's also a payment platform from a merchant perspective. But it's not an exchange.  What are your targets for investing further in bitcoin companies?  If digital currency was to become pervasive, there are some fundamental problems that need to be solved. We need exchanges based in New York and London that institutional capital can use and financial instruments can be created upon. That's one area.  The second thing that's important, as the Bitcoin protocol develops, you need a Red Hat-like company that takes on the open-source protocol and starts to provide services and tools around it, so it can be used in commercial settings more robustly.  From an authentication and identity perspective, you also need a Verisign equivalent in this space. At some point if bitcoin becomes regulated, you could see the agencies saying this kind of authentication mechanism needs to exist. That could be a pretty interesting, large company that could be created.  We're looking at, structurally, how do these pieces get put in place?  Are you looking to invest in a new exchange?  We're looking at exchanges across the board, either new or existing.  There are a lot of great entrepreneurs working on interesting ideas in this space in general. It's an exciting area – that's why we're here.  It seems like there's a flurry of activity in bitcoin startups right now.  The cycle has been: there was the early days, the Magic card traders at Mt. Gox. Then speculation drove a lot of the price enhancements, and with speculation, merchants started accepting it more and more.  What's happening now is really serious entrepreneurs like Jeremy Allaire at Circle, who has built multiple-platform companies before, are now getting into this space and saying, we could make this our life's work.  The quality of entrepreneurs being attracted to the space now is phenomenal. That's really what drives our interest. We're in the business of following smart people.  Is there also a difference in the number of pitches you get?  We saw a couple of dozen companies focused on various aspects of bitcoin last year, and that's getting enhanced.  Now that a number of early bitcoin investors have made enough money to become angel investors, is there more competition to fund startups in this space?  The competition to fund startups has not increased substantially. The number of people who changed status because of bitcoin is not that high. It was folks who were already well off who were speculating. The reason it's attracting angel investment is the quality of the entrepreneurs in the space.  Would you consider General Catalyst to be on the forefront of bitcoin investing?  We've been looking at it for about three years. I saw the first bitcoin companies over three years ago. We'd been talking through what we ought to do here, especially with our payments companies. I'd had several conversations with the companies – how does this play out? Through Y Combinator we made a small investment in Coinbase and Buttercoin.  And how has the interest level in the VC community changed since then?  Everybody's intrigued. There are a few firms that are actively looking in the area and then others that, it's on their radar, they are thinking about what to do. People worry about regulation.  Is there a critical mass point where most investors became aware of this? Are we past the point of initial scepticism?  I think it's still pretty early. The reason it's been on investors' radar is more because of their personal positions in bitcoin as a speculative asset class than as investors.  There's a common saying that, if you want to take advantage of bitcoin, the best thing is to buy bitcoin. That's not our business. We invest in technology companies. If you separate that out – how many companies are actually investing in technology companies – it's not a lot.  Have you encouraged the leadership of your payments startups, other than Circle, to start working with bitcoin?  Yes, to start thinking about it. But even without our encouragement they are thinking about it. All the relevant companies are getting their arms around it.  Are Stripe and Bigcommerce actively using bitcoin now?  Not yet.  To sum up?  Great entrepreneurs are entering the space and that's what's catching the attention of large investors like us.  This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

42374517,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvlCa7,1396440693,Neo & Bee CEO Moves to Reassure Investors Following Insolvency Confusion,"Earlier this week trading of LMB Holdings bitcoin shares were halted, after an apparent request filed by the company. LMB Holdings is the parent company of Neo & Bee, an innovative bitcoin firm which recently set up shop in Cyprus. The stocks were traded on the Havelock Investments exchange. In a statement posted on Havelock Investments on Monday, the exchange said it was formally informed by Neo & Bee that there ""may be a high possibility of questionable trading activity"". Therefore Havelock Investment halted trading, awaiting further instructions from Neo & Bee. The unusual move caused a fair amount of concern, which is hardly surprising in light of recent developments, namely the failure of Mt. Gox.  The plot thickens  Neo & Bee did not issue a public statement explaining the decision to halt trading, nor did Havelock Investment offer any further details. Neo & Bee CEO Danny Brewster was not in Cyprus at the time and this fact created a lot of buzz on various public forums, as people started to question Neo & Bee's liquidity. Brewster confirmed that he is not in Cyprus, but he stressed that he is away on business and that he is working to resolve ""big issues"" which were only compounded by people spreading allegations online.  On Wednesday morning Brewster posted a lengthy explanation of his predicament on The Bitcoin Talk forum. He confirmed that he was not in Cyprus and stressed that he left temporarily, without taking any money or bitcoins. Brewster said his silence was ""forced due to the actions of two people"" including one forum member, who posted false information about his life and family. ""Those posts had much wider ramifications than they probably assumed they would have, so I hold them partially responsible for what has occurred since their posts,"" wrote Brewster.  ""Following those posts on the forum, I received direct threats targeted directly at my daughter. They have been reported to the relevant authorities. Once those threats were made I took the advice to remain outside of Cyprus and remove contact with anyone that could be responsible for the threats, this included not speaking with members of staff that could be responsible.""  The last bit is perplexing, as it seems that Brewster might have had a falling out with key staff members.  Why did Brewster leave Cyprus?  Brewster insists that his decision to leave Cyprus was business-related and nothing more. ""My reason for leaving was to raise additional capital for the business through the sale of my equity as we had run out of liquidity, I had exhausted all of my own liquidity, too, through directors loans to the company. Every single bitcoin raised and spent is accounted for, any claims of embezzlement are nothing but empty claims with no foundation,"" he said. However, Brewster admitted the loss of bitcoins due to the closure of BitFunder/WeExchange, but he pointed out that he personally assumed that debt of 1,402BTC in order to protect the company. Brewster continued:  ""UKYO also owes me an additional 260BTC separately from the 1,420BTC. I also have 369.8BTC of my own Bitcoin stuck with Mt. Gox that would have been given to the company to settle all creditors and continue operations whilst more capital was raised. Having funds on Mt. Gox was a personal risk that I assumed and no company funds were ever held on there.""  Original recovery plan derailed  Brewster claims his plan was to raise more capital through the sale of some of his assets, but that he was forced to change his plans as soon as threats were made towards his daughter. Following the threats, he decided to sell all of his equity and allow the new owner to appoint a new CEO. Brewster then outlined his backup plan:  ""The whole process will be completed and handled through an agency that specializes in these matters, once the final details are completed, the agency details will be made available to interested parties who wish to purchase 100% of my equity in LMB Subsidiaries Ltd thus taking full control of all subsidiaries. I shall also be providing the new owner full rights over the Bitcoin debts currently owed by BitFunder/WeExchange as I know people are working on a solution to recovering those debts for everyone that has funds stuck there. This process will also write off all directors loans I have made to the company and I shall not receive any financial compensation through this sale process.""  He went on to say that his biggest mistake was using BitFunder/WeExchange during the fundraising process. Had he not had to cover the losses incurred due to the BitFunder failure, Brewster says he would have enough capital to cover all creditors and OPEX for the foreseeable future. ""I am working towards having this entire process completed within a short period of time to enable the business to recover, to ensure that those invested do not lose out following this process,"" he said. ""I apologize for my silence but I would like to reiterate that ZERO customer funds are under my control and none have been lost or used for business purposes. My decisions are based on what I deem to be the best option for my family.""  The end of the road?  Neo and Bee was endorsed by several high-profile figures and had received a largely positive response from the bitcoin community upon its launch in Cyprus. The company emphasised security: holding full bitcoin reserves, KYC and AML compliance, as well as top notch multisig cold storage. On the other side of the spectrum, it also had an expansive advertising campaign working to target mainstream consumers rather than bitcoin enthusiasts. If Brewster manages to secure capital or find a buyer for his equity, Neo & Bee could survive, albeit under new management. However, for the time being it appears that his plans are on hold, at best.

42377108,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6y5uj,1396436465,"Cloud Hashing CEO on Hardware, Network Growth and the Threat of Pools","Cloud computing and crytpocurrency mining may have seemed like an odd combination back in the days of GPU, and later FPGA, bitcoin mining. The rise of ASICs for SHA-256 transaction processing on the Bitcoin network, however, meant that something had to give.  That's where Cloud Hashing comes in: the company charges a per-gigahash contract fee that allows users to harness the company's own mining equipment. It's bitcoin mining in the cloud.  Given the fact that mining equipment is loud and noisy, Cloud Hashing could easily be compared to any other type of 'heavy lifting' computational process that has been moved into the cloud.  Servers, storage and miners  People generally don't keep servers or storage area networks in a household; hence the rise of the cloud. The 'regular' cloud is powered by massive data centres run by the Googles and the Amazons of this world with very specialized hardware.  Cloud Hashing is a unique cloud-computing company with respect to hardware, however. Because the mining hardware industry is moving so fast, the company quickly realized that buying and using off-the-shelf bitcoin mining gear is much easier than building its own infrastructure with its own boards housing ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits):  Emmanuel Abiodun, Cloud Hashing's CEO told CoinDesk:  ""We buy from every hardware company. We buy from Cointerra, Butterfly Labs, etc. We have orders in from pretty much everybody. We’re manufacturer agnostic.""  ""The reason for doing this is economic pressures that the hardware manufacturers are facing. It doesn’t make sense, at least not today from Cloud Hashing’s perspective, to build custom equipment with ASIC chips,"" he explained.  Abiodun said that this situation won’t change anytime soon, unless there is interest by huge technology players like Oracle to build out enterprise-level ASIC mines in data centres:  ""The speed with which the market is moving means that it is easy to consistently upgrade with the use of hardware vendors.""  Hardware risks  Cloud Hashing is taking on risk by doing this, however. Because hardware manufacturers struggle to ship new and more powerful mining products in expected timeframes, the company essentially takes that uncertainty upon itself.  That's just another reason why paying for mining in the cloud might be a safer bet than dealing with the stress of mining hardware companies slipping on their shipment dates.  Sure, cloud mining means less control, but there's zero chance of losing time mining with gear that is on a delay, and that will eventually only be worth scrap metal value.  Cloud Hashing knows that it will get the miners it orders at some point, and is also already hashing away so it doesn't have to worry so much about losing money from not delayed equipment.  Furthermore, the company already has plans to double its amount of mining power. Said Abiodun:  ""Today, we’re about 3PH/s. We want to be close to six by the end of the year.""  Network growth slowing  Cloud Hashing has seen a decline in the Bitcoin network's growth – a tapering off of network power. ""Growth used to be 4% per day, now we are under 1.5% per day,"" Abiodun said.  He explained that the likely culprit is the physical limitations that exist in terms of producing ASIC miners:  ""It’s basic economics. You can’t just keep doubling things. You can’t expect CoinTerra or Butterfly Labs to double their workforce every month.""  Manufacturers are expanding production, but there are limitations to fabricating the chips, building a product and shipping it out.  In other industries, companies get years to develop. In bitcoin mining, products go from the design stage to the market in mere months.  ""It’s all supply-chain management, which a lot of these companies are learning. We’re not at the level of Intel or AMD, who churn out thousands of these [chips] a day,"" said Abiodun.  Cloud Hashing's advantage  Cloudhashing exists in a crowded market. There are various options for cloud mining: hosted mining, virtual hosted mining and other cloud competitors.  One of the things that allows Cloud Hashing to stand out is that its scale means has its own pool for customers.  Said Abiodun:  ""We operate our own pool. We use our own management software. We don’t use a third party [for that]. It’s too much money to be trusting someone else with.""  He told CoinDesk that the entire pool is able to run using just one two- or three-core server.  Abiodun explained that the pool operation really just works like a router, in a bitcoin sense:  ""What a pool server does is it connects with the bitcoin network. And it reads the transactions that are processed through the miners.""  Open to all  Cloud Hashing has a unique approach. It's owns a large network of mining machines, and it allows any paying customer access. Many of the larger miners and pool operators often prefer to work in more secluded, secret ways.  The company's strategy is different. ""We’re very open. We’re trying to offer mining to everybody,"" Abiodun said.  Furthermore, mining hardware continues to evolve: chips are getting smaller, and there are hardware improvements to be had, according to Abiodun:  ""There’s stuff to do on the hardware side, like reducing latency. And not just with the chips, but with the boards that communicate with the chips.""  Pool worries  As chips become smaller and hardware gets faster, there's been a growth in ever-larger mining operations.  One concern has been that larger mining operations could ultimately end up with an unfair amount of control over the network as a whole.  ""That’s something that a lot of people talk about and worry about. We’re seeing the emergence of large miners like ourselves,"" said Abiodun.  Abiodun believes, though, that having 10 large pools as opposed to five large pools is better for the network as a whole.  There's room enough for everyone, Abiodun said, and a plethora of large pools each having a share is a good thing:  ""I do believe that we are more diversified than we were before. More larger pools are better for everybody.""  Rumour-mongering is all a part of the bitcoin mining industry, he explains:  ""I’ve heard everything: I’ve heard that the network would be 200 petahashes by now.""  But it isn't – the network has only reached 45 PH/s so far. So it's wise not to believe all of the chatter and noise.  That's why Cloud Hashing simplifies things down to mining-as-a-service, so people don't have to worry about the day-to-day operations of bitcoin mining, added Abiodun.

42377091,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6y5ZL,1396429900,University of Nicosia Launches Free 'Introduction to Digital Currencies' Online Course,"Cyprus' University of Nicosia announced today it has opened a six week, free and open enrolment online course called 'Introduction to Digital Currencies', aimed at anyone wishing to gain a greater understanding of the fundamentals of bitcoin and digital currency in general.  The MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) is due to start on 15th May, with other sessions starting each month thereafter (based on demand), plus accelerated formats for the fast-learning and time-poor.  The only prerequisite for enrolment in the MOOC is enough proficiency in English to understand the instruction, which will be given by University of Nicosia Computer Science and Finance professors, as well as bitcoin experts including Andreas Antonopoulos, a University of Nicosia Teaching Fellow. He said:  “It is an excellent opportunity for anyone to develop a good understanding of the technical and non-technical aspects of decentralized currencies in general and, more specifically, explore both bitcoin (the network) and bitcoin (the currency).”  To participate, registered students will need to participate in course sessions, complete exercises along the way and complete an assessment task at the end of the course.  Masters in Digital Currency  The University of Nicosia (UNIC) is the largest independent university in Cyprus and one of the largest English language universities in southern Europe. In November last year it introduced a Masters of Science Degree in Digital Currency, a 13 to 18 month course costing €11,760 ($16,250) and bridging aspects of computer science, economics, banking and finance and law, as well as other digital currency-specific topics.  The Masters Degree course is available both online and on-campus, and is aimed at solidifying the knowledge of anyone involved in the digital currency sphere, from finance professionals and entrepreneurs to government officials. The University is currently accepting registrations.  UNIC is also offering up to €5m in scholarships to students classified as living in 'low and middle income countries'.  The free MOOC serves as an on-ramp to the Masters Degree, representing the first six weeks of that course. Students registered in the Masters program will simply carry on after the MOOC is completed, and anyone who completes the MOOC gains credit for the Masters should they choose to continue in future.  Inspiration  Antonis Polemitis, a venture capitalist at Ledra Capital as well as an adjunct faculty member and University of Nicosia board member, is one of the driving forces behind the courses as well as a teacher.  UNIC's program was truly unique, he said, bringing together the interdisciplinary fields of study that all-round digital currency expertise demanded.  ""Last year, several members of our Board and our faculty started studying bitcoin and came to the conclusion that it was a major innovation in Computer Science that would have significant implications for finance,"" he said.  ""Given that we believe that this will be an important societal area, we decided, as the Board-level to make an investment of time and resources in this area.""  He added that other universities around the world, including Princeton, Stanford and George Mason, were also considering the topics. University of Nicosia, however, remains the only university currently offering an actual Masters Degree and free MOOC, open to anyone.  He said that although Cyprus is a leading trainer in and provider of financial services, the programs had a worldwide focus and stressed that anyone at all could sign up to study online.  UNIC began accepting bitcoin as payment for tuition in November last year and, within weeks, received its first bitcoin payment from a student.

42377117,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6y5Y5,1396405167,Judge Orders Mark Karpeles to Submit to Questioning in US,"Mark Karpeles, the CEO of troubled Japan-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, must travel to Dallas, Texas, this month to take part in his formal deposition, a form of sworn testimony that will lay the groundwork for his future defense.  Karpeles had previously suggested that the deposition take place in Taipei, Taiwan, though this motion was strongly opposed by lawyers representing US-based former exchange users.  Further, Karpeles will have compelling reason to make the trip, as the judge suggested that the journey will be necessary if he wants an extension of the company's bankruptcy protection in the US.  A Reuters report today quoted US Bankruptcy Judge Stacey Jernigan as saying:  ""If he avails himself of this court, my God, he is going to get himself over here.”  More details  Under Chapter 15 of US bankruptcy law, protection from creditors is not granted or extended automatically. However, Mt. Gox KK, the company's Japanese entity was granted an initial stay by the courts earlier this March. The stay has thus far prevented lawsuits from threatening this part of the company's assets and shielded it from fact-finding.  That stay was not granted to Mt. Gox Inc., its US entity, Tibanne KK or Mark Karpeles personally.  A hearing is scheduled for 20th May to decide whether Mt. Gox deserves to continue with such protection, and courts are likely to view the matter less favorably if they don’t have Mt. Gox management’s full cooperation.  Karpeles will have to appear at the offices of Baker & McKenzie, the firm representing Mt. Gox both in the US and Japan, in Dallas on 17th April, according to Jernigan’s order.  Mt. Gox's Chapter 15 bankruptcy was filed in Dallas, though depositions are informal and generally take place outside of a court.  A reluctant witness  To date, Karpeles has shown a strong reluctance to appear personally in the US since his once-dominant bitcoin exchange imploded in February, though he did allegedly meet with lawyers in the US around the time of Mt. Gox's initial bankruptcy filing.  Karpeles had offered to hold the deposition in Taiwan instead, suggesting US representatives unable to question him there could use a video link instead.  The bankruptcy hearings are separate to Mt. Gox's other legal problems in the US, such as Illinois resident Gregory Greene's class action suit. Mt. Gox also wants to delay any US action until after its bankruptcy proceedings in Japan are completed.  Further, these cases are joined by its as-yet-unresolved dispute with former partner Coinlab, which dates back to early last year.  Losing patience  There was a hint of frustration in Jernigan's words, particularly when Baker & McKenzie attorney John Mitchell said Mt. Gox may replace Karpeles as its 'foreign representative' in US bankruptcy court. ""He filed the case,"" she replied.  Mt. Gox has been fulfilling its local legal obligations and doing most of its communicating in Japanese first recently, but its largest customer base by far was the US.  Karpeles, who was born in France and lives in Japan, speaks English as a second language and may be unsettled at the prospect of facing questioning from a US court, or even angry US customers in person. He is, however, probably also the only person with any idea of what truly happened to Mt. Gox's finances.  According to previous reports from company employees, who were all on short-term contracts, no-one outside management had any access to the Gox's records and attempts to ask Karpeles to prove the company's reserves were rebuffed.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/04/02/judge-orders-mark-karpeles-to-submit-to-questioning-in-us,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9607e474f81f2dfebef94abf991f911452ea7b94-1572x968.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
