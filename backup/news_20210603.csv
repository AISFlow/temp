42386939,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBW3Bf,1622756312,Top US Lawmaker Presses Big Companies on Ransomware Crypto Payments,"U.S. Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) wants Colonial Pipeline and CNA Financial to disclose the decision-making processes that led them to pay cryptocurrency to recover data from ransomware attackers.      In letters sent to the firms Thursday, Maloney asked for documents outlining how these victims decided to pay the perpetrators, any documents or communications received from the attackers, whether any government agencies provided input and whether the firms checked to ensure they didn’t violate sanctions.      “I am extremely concerned that the decision to pay international criminal actors sets a dangerous precedent that will put an even bigger target on the back of critical infrastructure going forward,” the chair of the House Oversight Committee said in a statement.      In the letters, Maloney asks for “all responsive documents” that detail how the attack was discovered, whether the companies sought external consultation about paying the ransoms and documents detailing the decryption tools provided by the attackers. She set a June 17 deadline, giving the companies two weeks to gather these materials.      The letters come as another high-profile firm, global meat producer JBS, begins recovering from a ransomware attack that occurred over the weekend.      A spokesperson for the committee did not immediately return a request for further comment about the focus of the investigation.    Growing scrutiny    Thursday’s letter comes as scrutiny around ransomware attacks and the crypto used to pay these ransoms ramps up in the U.S. government. Earlier in the day, the Department of Justice sent a memo to U.S. attorney offices and branches in all 50 states, asking them to file an “urgent report” if they hear of a significant ransomware attack.      The DOJ is also coordinating ransomware investigations out of a central task force. John Carlin, acting deputy attorney general, told Reuters the goal is to find connections between different actors in an effort to mitigate the entire chain of attacks.      President Joe Biden has also directed the federal government to evaluate how it responds to ransomware attacks. This review will require the federal government to “expand” its cryptocurrency analysis tools, a White House spokesperson said.      The House Homeland Security Committee held a hearing on ransomware payments in May, and has another scheduled on June 9 to conduct a post-mortem on the Colonial Pipeline attack. Maloney is not a member of this committee, but previously published a joint statement with Rep. Bennie Thompson, the Homeland Security Committee chair, saying they were “disappointed” that Colonial did not provide specific information about paying a ransom.

Meanwhile, ether is continuing to steal trading volume from BTC during a steady price rise toward $2,900.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $38,532 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 1.7% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $37,311-$39,402 (CoinDesk 20)  Ether (ETH) trading around $2,789 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). In the green 1.1% over the previous 24 hours.  Ether’s 24-hour range: $2,673-$2,882 (CoinDesk 20)  Bitcoin swaps stay steady    Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Thursday by 1.7% as of press time. It was below the 10-hour moving average but above the 50-hour, a flat signal for market technicians.      BTC’s price jumped from $37,311 at 05:15 UTC (10:15 p.m. ET Wednesday) to $39,402 by 13:30 UTC (6:30 a.m. ET) Thursday, a 5.6% gain based on CoinDesk 20 data. Bitcoin then settled somewhat, at $38,532 as of press time.      “We expect spot bitcoin to trade in a range short term with a slight bullish bias as frenzied leveraged longs have been washed out,” noted quant trading firm QCP Capital in its most recent investor note. “We’ve seen significant buying and selling at $30,000 and $40,000 levels, respectively.”      According to data aggregator Skew, the cost of perpetual swaps, which is liquidity provided to leveraged traders, has consistently hovered near zero (0%) since May 26.      It’s a sign many traders aren’t piling up leverage to go directional either way because the funding rates will pop or fall based on bull or bear orientation.      “BTC tried to break $40,000 to break out of the $30,000-$40,000 range that we’ve been stuck in after the mid-May crash,” said Elie Le Rest, a partner at quantitative trading firm ExoAlpha. “So the $40,000 line seems to be breakable as market participants are regaining confidence after the big crash two weeks ago.”      On May 23, bitcoin hit a three month low of $34,259, while ether dipped to $2,080 that day.      Read More: Bitcoin Attempts Price Breakout, While Analysts See Limited Upside    BTC volatility rising, ETH takes a breather    Thirty-day volatilities in BTC (46%) and ETH (68%) have picked back up after having dipped to 2021 lows on April 15. Ether’s 30-day volume, for instance, went to a whopping 175% Tuesday before slipping while bitcoin’s seems to keep rising, at 92% as of Wednesday’s closing data.      “We are still cautious of a potential BTC downside as the volatility skew remains high with puts being substantially more expensive than calls,” QCP Capital noted Thursday. “We reckon that downside vols are a decent sell.”      The steady rise in volatility comes after the big price dump for crypto on May 23, noted David Russell, VP of Market Intelligence at brokerage TradeStation Group.      “It’s natural to expect higher volatility after the kind of sell-off we got in late May,” said Russell. “It’s also normal for prices to pause and consolidate after a big move.”    Ether volumes bigger than BTC again    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether, was trading around $2,789 as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET), gaining 1.1% over the prior 24 hours. The asset is below the 10-hour moving average but above the 50-hour, a sideways signal for market technicians.      Ether gained from $2,673 at 02:00 UTC (7 p.m. ET Wednesday) to $2,882 by 13:15 UTC (6:15 a.m. ET) Thursday a 7.8% climb based on CoinDesk 20 data. ETH has since lost some steam, at $2,789 as of press time.      For the past five days, ether’s daily trading volume on major spot exchanges tracked by CoinDesk Research has been higher than bitcoin's. It’s a stretch of consistency that goes back a month so far, as 14 days out of the last 30 saw ETH’s trading volume higher than BTC.      George Clayton, managing partner of investment firm Cryptanalysis Capital, says newer capital coming into the space might be looking at the prospects of ether over bitcoin for the future, leading to higher volumes.      “Maybe ETH is seeing a bit more institutional flow,” Clayton said. “For institutions that have successfully fit crypto into their compliance frameworks and are already invested in BTC, ETH is the next step.”      Read More: Crypto Credit Rating Firm Credmark Pivots to Modeling DeFi Protocol Risks    Costs of using Ethereum drop    The cost of “gas,” the fees paid in ether to use the Ethereum network, is near a three-month low. After spiking to an astounding 305 gwei median or middle price for interacting with the network on May 11, that price has slipped to as low as 24 gwei by May 30. Gwei is defined as one-billionth of one ETH so 1 gwei equals 0.000000001.      The drop in fees is a good sign that despite increasing usage of the Ethereum network, the costs are much lower than they have been in some time. This is especially true as ether’s price has been slowly trending up, which has historically caused fees to jump, noted TradeStation’s Russell.      “Ether is already back near its early-May levels,” Russell told CoinDesk.    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mostly higher Thursday.

42434506,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPDZZh,1622749758,DAOs Prepare for the Next Crypto Winter With Treasury Diversification,"Longtime crypto denizens can see the future: Winter is coming (it always is).      ""I think there's scars left over from the bear market. While I think there's a mentality of 'up only,' that's more among the smaller teams. The bigger ones have been through it,"" said Accelerated Capital, a pseudonymous founder who uses the name of his fund as his handle.      A lot of new people have gotten into investing in cryptocurrency over the last few months. Some may be so new they won't remember the last ""crypto winter,"" which started with the regulatory crackdown in 2018 and continued at least into very late 2019. When it first hit, many crypto startups were laying off staff by the dozens.      Lots of those companies survived and new ones launched regardless. All those survivors have started to get ready for the inevitable downturn in this market.      This has always been an industry that could print ""money"" at will. During the last long bearish period, select projects conceived of a new form of money from nothing: governance tokens (which we at times have called ""growth tokens"" because early on they do more to drive volume than to distribute authority).      The craze for governance tokens began with the launch of Compound's COMP token in 2020.    Read more: New DeFi DAO Relies on ‘Talent Hunters’ to Vet Yield-Farming Projects    That innovation has given teams more latitude this time around to prepare for slow days ahead.      Those preparations look quite different than they did in the 2017 cycle, when token-powered projects created large treasuries of a protocol's native token and allowed it to be controlled by the founding team. That approach has become passé. Today, it's more common for a new crypto endeavor to create a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) to manage its assets.      That is, many people are given a chance to hold a governance token and those holders collectively control the protocol's codebase and its treasury.      Aaron Wright, the founder of a startup for making legal agreements on Ethereum, OpenLaw, spoke to this new arrangement during a panel at Consensus 2021 last week. ""The internet is building a native structure. We've all lived in those structures in different ways,"" he said. ""And if you think about how the internet works, it doesn't work in a hierarchical way. It works in a swarm-like manner, and DAOs are trying to capture that energy productively and deploy people's thoughts, ideas and capital for higher purposes. And it's working.""      DAOs often sit on a large quantity of their governance tokens (UNI on Uniswap or YFI on Yearn, for two examples). These hoards are worth a lot now, which makes it look like the projects have a very long runway. But what if a governance token goes through a long downturn? What if precisely when it needs to invest to drive value back to its core asset, a company’s treasury isn't worth enough on the open market to do so?      Every reasonably experienced investor knows what to do when they have too much of a highly volatile asset at a high point in a cycle: diversify that portfolio.      Artem Gramma is a core contributor to Index Coop, a project that makes investable crypto indices on Ethereum, such as the DeFi Pulse Index and the Flexible Leverage Index. ""I think treasury diversification is extremely important to a project's ability to survive and execute through the bear market,"" he said.    Diversification    DAO members are now deciding to unload portions of those governance hoards for ... something else. Usually, the teams want stablecoins, or something that generates some revenue. That way, the project's fate is not completely dependent on its native token's price.      ""I think there's a general sense in the space right now of, 'What's going to break projects if we have a bear market?'"" Gramma said.      For one very recent example, in early spring the lossless lottery startup PoolTogether wrapped up a vote on a diversification deal it has been discussing since early May. Several funds, including ParaFi Capital, Galaxy Digital and Dragonfly Capital will buy 7.2% of the treasury of its POOL tokens for $5.95 million in USDC. The vote closed with all the POOL tokens that voted backing the proposal.      ""Obviously, the main idea behind it is we have on paper a very large treasury, but it's almost exclusively in the POOL token,"" PoolTogether founder Leighton Cusack said. POOL launched in mid-February.      According to Cusack, none of the PoolTogether staff voted their own holdings.      But this is just the latest recent example of a project taking tokens it allocated to the treasury and selling them or otherwise unloading them in exchange for something whose value is unlikely to go south if the crypto market does.    How it started, how it's going    Right now, the form this is taking is fairly straightforward. Venture capital firms with fairly deep pockets propose a deal to the community. They offer a fairly decent discount on the market price in exchange for treasury tokens, usually with some kind of lockup. The PoolTogether lockup is fairly typical: none unlock for a year and then they go through another year of vesting.      “Obviously, there is a deal component,” Accelerated Capital said. These investors want to get the best price they can with the most flexibility, but DAOs want to avoid a sudden supply shock as well. So, the two parties have to negotiate price, lockups and other such terms.      But we're already starting to see hints of other crypto-native approaches to diversification that work less like a traditional deal and rely more on the open market, potentially creating interesting new dynamics in the market.      Further, DAO members are beginning to appreciate that their rights as holders of a governance token may be more multifaceted than they had previously realized.      ""Owners of the governance tokens from these DAOs not only have a right to the cash flow on these networks, they also have claim to some of the assets in the DAO,"" Ben Forman of ParaFi Capital said. In other words, it is in their interest to mitigate risk in a treasury's assets.      ""I feel like every treasury DAO is thinking about this now,"" Forman said. To that end, Shreyas Hariharan, founder of treasury consultancy Llama, wrote about best practices for diversification on crypto blogging platform Mirror in March.    Step by step    The trend started with Synthetix in February, when its sDAO announced that it had sold $12 million in its SNX token to Paradigm, Coinbase Ventures and IOSG.      Synthetix founder Kain Warwick explained via email it did not need to take a full DAO vote to make the deal because Synthetix has a multisig of three people empowered to make deals along these lines.      Synthetix has been around longer than the newer DAOs, a product of the initial coin offering era that preceded this one, so Synthetix is still in the middle of evolving into a fully decentralized mode of operations. ""I am working on an SIP [Synthetix Improvement Proposal] that will remove this discretionary power soon,"" Warwick wrote in an email.      After that, treasury diversification went from a best practice to a full-on trend at crypto speed.      Then the Bitcoin-oriented BadgerDAO began discussions to create a similar structure to Synthetix, where a team voted on by the DAO could make deals to diversify its treasury. A proposal was passed and the DAO announced its first sale on March 3: $21 million to ParaFi, Polygon and Ethereum's mega-wallet, 0xb1.      On April 2, the SushiSwap community voted through sushiHOUSE, a treasury management partnership run by Yam Finance.      On April 28, Lido, the protocol for derivatives on Ethereum, best known for making stETH that tracks ETH committed to an Ethereum 2 node, approved a vote to sell 100 million of its LDO governance token for 21,600 ETH in a deal led by Paradigm but including lots of other investors as well, including Three Arrows, Jump Trading, Alameda Research and many more.      On May 5, Decentral Games, which enables gambling inside virtual worlds, considered exchanging $200,000 worth of MANA held by its treasury for a Metaverse Index token created by Index Coop, thereby better aligning it with the sort of projects that are likely to host its games.      (This deal is a little different because Decentral earns a lot of tokens for its treasury through its operations; MANA is not the Decentral governance token, but many users who play in Decentraland play with MANA.)      As mentioned above, PoolTogether just finalized its deal for a sale of POOL tokens, in a discussion that started April 30.      Hugh Karp, the CEO of Nexus Mutual, the smart contract risk management project, told CoinDesk that its community is actively looking at diversification right now (most likely going for an interest-earning form of ETH, such as StETH), as is Index Coop.      So far, this process has been one initiated by funds. ""The investors really came to us. We didn't actually search them out,"" Cusack, PoolTogether’s founder, said.      Earning a large discount on a protocol's governance token may sound like a very attractive deal, but it's worth noting they tend to come with pretty aggressive lockup terms, restricting reselling. Cusack called the prices ""illiquidity discounts.""      ""It's a good way for investors to acquire large positions,"" Forman said, but the ""jury's still out on whether these are good deals.""      ""Now governance has optionality,"" Cusack said. For PoolTogether, the USDC allows the DAO to immediately make its lossless lottery more attractive. It can add the funds to a sponsored pool, which increases the payout to players but doesn't reduce their chances of winning.      ""One of the core takeaways is it was more about getting the right contributors on board,"" Kasper Rasmussen from the Lido team said.      While the tokens are not liquid, they can usually vote in governance, giving the protocol new active (but also large) voting blocks.      Forman argued that this is a good thing, because investment firms have the bandwidth and the motivation to improve these projects. ""We're oftentimes users in these networks as well as investors in them,"" Forman said.    Automated BFF    The era of sweet deals to VCs might soon give way to a new era of projects diversifying on the open market.      Index Coop's Gramma expects a VC-oriented deal in the works now will help seed a larger deal with the general public (if everything goes according to plan).      It's possible to leverage automation to diversify a treasury's portfolio. For example, Gramma said, a treasury could set up a smart pool on Balancer, one with rules built into it to, say, start with a 10% USDC and 90% INDEX (The Coop's governance token) allocation.      That pool would immediately begin earning trading fees on Balancer, but beyond that it could be set up with rules that might say, for example, over a 12-week period, increase the allocation of USDC to 25% gradually.      These are just hypothetical parameters but they help to illuminate Gramma's point. ""The main concern there is: Do you communicate this to the market, that you're going to be selling into it? How transparent do you want to be?""      ""In the spirit of the space, if there's less private capital formation in the token world, I think that's a good thing,"" Forman said.    Read more: Money Reimagined: Crypto Winter Again? Time to Regroup    And the opportunity for fostering greater resiliency is huge.      ""If you think about a lot of these treasuries that have a lot of capital, if they just convert a little to stablecoin they can cover all of their expenses,"" Gramma said.      In other words, a treasury could take DAI or USDC and yield-farm it on Compound or Yearn and potentially earn enough each year to pay for developers, designers and business development without touching the principal.      ""My goal would be a lot of these treasuries are relatively diversified so they have income to sustain operations,"" Accelerated Capital said. ""Hopefully, we get them all sorted out before the next bear market.""      Accelerated has been actively working with projects, such as Decentral Games, to look for opportunities to mix up their holdings to foster resiliency.      Not everyone is rushing to diversify, however. The founder of Swiss Stake, the company behind Curve Finance, the DEX for stablecoins, wrote in an email, ""The best way to prepare for bear market is building something which will be useful in the bear market.""      Curve's Mikhail Egorov said if his project needs funds, he prefers to borrow against holdings, earn yield that beats the interest on the loan and put the difference to work in operations.      ""I am a crypto maximalist who survived two bear markets (2014-2016 and 2018-2020), so I think I am not panicking at [the] slightest,"" Egorov wrote via email.    Danger, danger    It is hoped that one threat has been obvious to everyone throughout this entire discussion: silent but deep pockets.      There would really be no way to stop an extremely large fund from buying up a significant position in a governance token, holding it in several different wallets, proposing a sweetheart deal to a DAO and then using its holdings to vote it through.      Of course, the worse a deal was the more tokens they would have to hold. But for a decent but maybe somewhat questionable deal, a whale wouldn't need to hold enough tokens for a majority of the vote. They would only need enough to sway it. No one would likely ever know.      ""That's a potential vector,"" Cusack granted. ""There could be something down the road that goes a nefarious way.""      Forman agreed, but without a lot of concern. ""I think there are these governance edge cases that aren't fully mitigated that make something like that possible – but not probable.""      So it's something to watch out for but not worry over.      Meanwhile, as DAOs diversify their treasuries, their members are also giving more people access to power over the direction the projects take. This will inevitably yield unforeseeable consequences, the most likely of which will be further consolidation of power by large holders over each project.      Assets have a way of gravitating to a few well-resourced hands. The more tokens that find their way out onto the market, the fewer holders there are likely to be over time. Somehow that just seems to be the way of the world.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/06/03/daos-prepare-for-the-next-crypto-winter-with-treasury-diversification,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6ea95e126a313cd70603c32844cf594463882f95-1800x1200.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434507,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPDZdh,1622740202,"Bitcoin’s Bull Market ‘May Have Come to an End,’ Says MRB Partners","The rally in bitcoin (BTC) over the past year may be nearing an end, according to New York-based MRB Partners, a boutique investment research firm.      In a May 25 report titled, ""Has The Crypto Fever Broken?"", the analysts cite growing concerns with cryptocurrencies' environmental impact, possible regulatory risks, negative technical trends and a future reduction in monetary stimulus as among the many reasons bitcoin could have a tough time ahead.      “Easy money has helped fuel the crypto bubble, and a slow unwinding of this trend globally will ultimately become a headwind for the speculative digital asset,” wrote MRB.      Bitcoin has nearly doubled in price over the past year and is up about 30% year to date. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value suffered a volatile period in May, which appears to be stabilizing over the short term. However, some analysts expect limited upside in bitcoin despite the possibility of a brief bounce.    MRB mentioned concerns about environmental issue, leverage and renewed fears of a global regulatory crackdown in the U.S. and China as possible headwinds for cryptocurrencies.  To reduce the negative environmental impact, “crypto mining systems would need to allow miners to produce tokens for significantly less cost compared to their current price,” wrote MRB.  Increased mining efficiency could lead to lower energy consumption, which typically occurs during corrections in the price of bitcoin, according to MRB.  Moreover, overleveraging ""has also become a mainstream issue for crypto markets and regulators are now being tasked with gauging the risks originating from increased non-financial intermediaries/exchanges.”    But not all may not be lost for crypto markets, according to the researchers.      “It remains entirely possible that these assets could develop into a mainstream investment vehicle,” wrote MRB. “We suspect this process will be a very long road ahead with more boom/bust phases along the way.”",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION | TRADING,Damanick Dantes,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/06/03/bitcoins-bull-market-may-have-come-to-an-end-says-mrb-partners,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/59dccb24e782bec4c36e9e49a340cfde845f1424-1280x856.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434505,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPDZbh,1622740010,"Daryl Morey on Crypto and NFTs: 'It's the Start of a Major, Major Trend'","In 2011, when he was general manager of the National Basketball Association's Houston Rockets, Daryl Morey was searching for ideas. He wanted brainstorming fodder: good ideas, outside-the-box ideas, even goofy ideas. Who has plenty of ideas? Fans of the team. So in a highly unorthodox move, Morey asked the Rockets’ fan base to email ideas on how to improve the team. They could be ideas on how to recruit free agents, ideas on drafting strategy, ideas on anything.      Then he did something even more unorthodox.      Over Twitter, Morey announced that the fan who pitched the best idea would win “a bitcoin.”      This was a decade ago, 2011. And when’s the last time you heard someone use the phrase “a bitcoin”? The proof still exists on Twitter, where Morey cheerfully doled out the bitcoin, at the time worth $7.24. Most Rockets fans had no idea what he was talking about. “I had to google ‘bitcoin,’” confessed one Rockets junkie. This was so long ago, the Rockets fans were puzzled by Morey’s use of a hashtag, confused by the appearance of “#bitcoin” in his tweet. “Since when did # become ‘hashtag’?” one fan posted. “I always thought it was called ‘pound’ symbol?’”    Read more: Mark Cuban on Bitcoin, NFTs and What Comes Next: ‘The Upside Is Truly Unlimited’    This is vintage Morey. Always three or five steps ahead.      A quick primer for the non-hoops crowd: Morey is widely credited with helping to shape the modern-day NBA, or as Michael Lewis once put it, he’s “Basketball’s Nerd King.” Morey loves data. He loves finding an edge. Thanks in large part to Morey’s charts and spreadsheets, players now shoot more three-pointers (Morey found they’re statistically a higher value shot) and chuck up fewer mid-range jumpers (statistically, a dog’s breakfast).      The phrase “game changer” is usually a cliche, but Morey literally changed the game. True, Morey is not the only influence – see also: Steph Curry – but it’s a copycat league. As other teams followed Morey’s blueprint, the average score has jumped from 99.9 in 2007 (Morey’s first year as Rockets GM) to 112 today.      How is this relevant to blockchain?      When billionaire investors like Michael Saylor or Paul Tudor Jones share their interest in crypto, the space celebrates it as a kind of validation. I would argue that Morey provides the same kind of imprimatur. He’s good at sniffing out trends. He’s good at spotting what’s next. He’s the most forward-thinking GM in the most forward-thinking sports league. If Morey embraces crypto? There are worse mainstream signals. (Disclosure: As a lifelong fan of my hometown Houston Rockets, I’ve been on Team Morey for years. Look elsewhere for objectivity.)      On our call, Morey brushes off these kinds of plaudits, modestly saying, “I’m just always into everything new, probably incorrectly at times, where I waste time or money.”      Maybe. But his decade-long enthusiasm for crypto seems deeper than a quick bit of dabbling. Morey’s so OG that he was involved in the Mt. Gox bankruptcy case, he bought a CryptoKitty, he both collects and mints non-fungible tokens (NFT), he gamely drops into a podcast with Anthony “Pomp” Pompliano, he collects CryptoPunks (and even used one as his Twitter avatar), he sells tweets as NFTs (and donates the funds to the American Civil Liberties Union), and he scoops up NBA Top Shot moments. His crypto enthusiasm seems more rooted in principles than making a buck. When retweeting Pomp’s celebration of Bitcoin Pizza Day, for example, he framed it as, “Get delicious pizza and stop authoritarian oppression – win/win.” (Few can top Morey’s anti-authoritarian credentials.)      These days, of course, Morey is the general manager of another NBA team, the Philadelphia 76ers, and once again, of course, his team is deep in the championship hunt. A few weeks before his Sixers entered the playoffs, Morey spoke to CoinDesk about his strategy for investing in NFTs, how he (kind of) almost bought an NFT from Edward Snowden and why NFTs are the “start of a major, major trend"" but that we’re also primed for a shakeout.      CoinDesk: So I could talk hoops with you for hours but I know our time is limited. You’ve been into crypto since waaaaay back. How did that start?      Daryl Morey: I’m a big decentralized guy, a big civil liberties guy – anything that allows a fundamental thing to happen without a central authority intrigued me. So I had a bunch of bitcoin by 2011, or maybe the end of 2010. And I was giving away bitcoin on Twitter in 2011 as part of a Rockets ideas giveaway. Of course, it was not a $60,000 idea. [Note: Bitcoin was worth $60,000 at the time of our conversation, in what now feels like five years ago.]      Just the whole idea [of bitcoin] appealed to me. And then I went through the roller coaster of getting hacked and being in a Japanese bankruptcy case and just the whole nine yards.    Read more: Spencer Dinwiddie: Why NBA Players Are Warming to Crypto    You lost some bitcoin on Mt. Gox, right?      Yeah, I did. Half of it.      Why half?      My instincts were to not put all of it in any one place. So I had some of it on a wallet on my computer in my house. And then I had half of it on Mt. Gox, which afterwards I felt so dumb about. At the time I was like, “Well, now I need to do something with it. Okay, I'll put it on this exchange, Mt. Gox.” And because it was so little money at the time, I didn’t really think too intentionally about it.      Then I found out that Mt. Gox – M-T-G-O-X – meant ""Magic: The Gathering Online eXchange."" And I’m like, ""What the hell? I put my bitcoin on a Magic: The Gathering trading card site?!"" I was laughing and I felt really dumb afterwards. So I lost all of that.      Wait, what happened with your Mt. Gox bitcoin?      I was in the Japanese bankruptcy case. And then Bain Capital did a really smart thing. They went to everyone in that case and offered 10 cents on the dollar. I took it because my wife’s cousin – a bankruptcy judge in New Jersey – was saying, “You’re never going to see any of that. Take what you can get.” In retrospect, I should have kept it and hoped to get it back because it’s worth so much more now. But whatever. It is what it is, and Bain Capital is smart for a reason.      And then you were also early into CryptoKitties, right?      So I wish I had been more into it. I was into CryptoKitties, for sure, and I grabbed one. I still have my original, which is only worth around 100 bucks. But I didn’t quite get it. Everyone was saying this was a “digital collectible,” and I got that angle, even though I wasn’t really into cats. But I didn’t get the scarcity angle. Because with the original CryptoKitties you can breed more and more.    And I’m like, 'What the hell? I put my bitcoin on a Magic: The Gathering trading card site?!'    You were worried that because you can just breed cats – endlessly breeding and breeding f’ing cats – then there wouldn’t be real scarcity?      Right. I didn't see the scarcity angle. I was wrong about that because some of them are worth a lot now. I wish I had dove in deeper. I didn’t get that if someone made it scarce, which they did with CryptoPunks shortly thereafter, that it would change the game. And I was skeptical of shysters and hucksters jumping in.      What gave you more confidence in NFTs?      When I found out that NBA Top Shot was licensed, and that Roham [Roham Gharegozlou, Dapper Labs CEO] has a real plan for rolling it out to maintain scarcity and that, [as] with CryptoPunks, only 10,000 would ever be made, then I jumped into it in a big way.      So now you’re both an NFT collector and an NFT creator. What was it like to mint your NFT?      Well, it's pretty straightforward. People make it sound hard. But I like to describe NFTs as just a unique barcode someone can't copy, that you can put on anything. And when you describe it that way, people get that it’s not especially hard. It's just a thing.      I love that description. How’d you choose what you minted?      I was trying to make sure I did something that made some sense. And so I thought, yeah, the original formula that I got moderately famous for, I’ll do that. [This is the Pythagorean Expectation Formula, which Morey adapted to the NBA.] And I’ll do it for charity. To my point on shysters and hucksters, I didn't feel right making money on it. So I gave all the proceeds to the ACLU.      How many NFTs did you mint?      I did five of them. I like five as a nice scarce number. You don't want to do just one. Somewhere between five and 50, I think, is the sweet spot for how many things you mint of something to still get the scarcity element.      So I did five, and people snapped them up pretty quick for around $2,500. Four of them sold immediately.      You should have priced them higher!      When there was still one left, I was like, “Oh s**t, I want to keep one!” So I kept one. Because I’m not going to be someone who, you know, just mints more or something. I would hate that. I also sold a couple of tweets for ACLU charity as well. They didn't quite do as well as Jack Dorsey’s or Ed Snowden’s. Did you see Ed Snowden’s tweet? I think he got almost [$]4 million … [Editor’s note: Actually, it was 2,224 ETH, or $5.4 million, on the day of sale.]      Oh I’m sure.      I have a funny story. So I know the people around Ed Snowden really well. And I've talked to Ed, and I think he’s an American hero who still needs to be celebrated more. And I thought [Donald] Trump could do the one right thing in his presidency and pardon him. But of course he didn’t.      And I hadn't known about the sale today. [Note: We spoke on April 16, the day of Snowden’s NFT sale.] I just saw a tweet about it. And 15 minutes from the end of the auction, it was going for 13 Ethereum [around $31K at the time]. I immediately called the people around Ed. I was like, ""Is this real? Because if it's 13 Ethereum, I'll buy it.""    Read more: How NFTs Became Art, and Everything Became an NFT    Sure.      And then, I realized I read it wrong. It was going for 1,300 Ethereum. So they were laughing at me. They were, like, ""No, that's 1,300, Daryl."" I'm thinking, “Okay, I'll let someone else do that one.""      Yeah, the random bus driver’s NFT goes for 13 ethereum.      Exactly.      Can you describe your NFT investing strategy? Because my understanding is that you look for artists who might be the next bigthing, and are currently undervalued. And this sounds a lot like what you do as a GM, hunting for undervalued players.      On the art side there are some very legitimate artists in the space. But then there’s also a lot of nonsense. And there's a shakeout coming. Those [NFTs from the nonsense artists] are going to go to near zero, I think.      I had already been a fan of Beeple’s digital art. So when I saw Beeple’s sale go for a crazy amount, I immediately thought, “Well, s**t, I'll look for all of my favorite digital artists. I'll see if they're selling."" Shockingly, very few were selling when I first went to look a few months ago.    Unless you're asleep at the wheel, every major organization, sports or not, is looking at how to use the technology in the back end.    Things change pretty quick.      When I first went to look, very few artists were actually selling any NFTs. But every single digital artist whose work I knew – and thought was good – I just grabbed all of them. I'm probably most excited about getting some of Pascal Blanche's stuff. He's just so talented.      And when he did a ""Dune"" thing, I thought, ""Oh my God. I have to get the 'Dune' thing"" because I love the book. So, yeah, I think Pascal has a chance to be the next Beeple, for example. And so I’m just squatting those.      And your strategy for NBA Top Shot?      I’m trying to get younger players that I think have a good future, and to get the scarcer ones. For Sorare, same thing, I’m trying to grab the younger players that I think have a big future. Because when the shakeout comes, there's going to be a chase to quality.      That’s why I love CryptoPunks. I love the better Top Shot moments of younger players, who are going to be good for 10 to 12 years going forward. I love the Sorare soccer players who are younger and are going to be great later.      There’s going to be a moment when everyone thinks, “This was all a huge mistake.” That moment’s coming. It happened with bitcoin when it went back to $3,000. And everyone was like, “Bitcoin is dead. It’s all bulls**t.” That’s going to happen in NFTs. There’s going to be a period where everyone thinks, “Anyone who did anything right now is an idiot.” Then it goes to quality and the foundation of the idea. And the reality is, there’s going to be quality, and the idea is great.      Why do you like the idea so much?      Digital collectibles are superior to physical collectibles. I just moved from Houston to Philly and it was a pain in the ass. I had to move 10,000 comics. I had to move all of my wall art. I had to move all of this s**t, and with digital stuff you just move it. It's definitely superior. And it’s the start of a major, major trend. So things like CryptoPunks, things like Top Shot, Sorare, all of this early stuff – as long as it’s quality – is going to be worth, I think, five to 10 to 100 times in five years. But we’re going to have to go through a cycle.    Read more: Jeff Wilser: In Europe, Football NFTs and Tokens Are No Fantasy    It sounds like many players are very Top Shot savvy, and NFT savvy. They’re into it. Do you see any complications here down the road? Like, what if the players want to mint NFTs or do things that are competitive with Top Shot? And will we have a kind of “crypto players empowerment” movement that leads to an almost meta-negotiation?      Well, the nice thing is, I think the players' union and the league office are on top of this. First off, they can make an NFT now, nothing stops them. There's no agreement. There may be certain kinds of things – like game action – where there are rules about what they can make. But just like me, they’re personally going to be able to do whatever they want. So nothing’s preventing that.      They're also benefiting in a big way. I mean, give credit to Michele Roberts [executive director of the NBA Players Association] and Adam [Adam Silver, NBA commissioner] and their whole infrastructure. Everyone’s making a lot of money in Top Shot at the league, and that flows into BRI [basketball-related income] and it’s shared 50/50.      The way that Adam and Michele have structured it, where the players and the league office have this partnership, really allows for these kinds of things to flourish. It helped us in the bubble – we were the first league back. And that’s because of the partnership. And for things like Top Shot and NFTs, that partnership allows these kinds of ideas to flourish.      Players might see a Top Shot moment of themselves selling for $250K, and they wonder how they benefit. Well, they do benefit. How they benefit is a little complicated because you have to look at the licensing flows, but they definitely do benefit. It’s really nice how the NBA has done everything.      How much is the NBA – to the extent that you’re aware – looking into other types of NFTs, or fan tokens, or other blockchain concepts, whether for ticketing or other fan engagement tools?      Unless you're asleep at the wheel, every major organization, sports or not, is looking at how to use the technology in the back end. And most of them are probably going to screw it up. [Laughs.] But everyone is looking at it. I think you're going to see tons of announcements from players, the league office, players' unions, teams, organizations – there’s going to be a ton of announcements. And if they’re going to get into it, it’s important that people really understand the underlying technology and the underlying things that are going to drive value.    Read more: Dapper Labs’ NBA Top Shot Has Crossed the Million-User Mark    You’re most famous for using data and analytics to uncover opportunities and exploit inefficiencies in the market. What are some inefficiencies that you see in the crypto markets, that you think can maybe be exploited?      NFTs are going to be a real dangerous space to put money into for the next year, because there’s just going to be a lot of low-quality stuff that’s going to go to zero. To me, that’s the inefficiency. It’s similar to the first explosion of all the different kinds of altcoins and s**tcoins. There’s a flight to quality, and it flew to bitcoin and ethereum and a few others. It’s similar here [with NFTs]. The inefficiency is the newly minted stuff that isn’t really valuable.      How about a crypto project that you’re bullish on?      I’m really excited about y.at. Their vision is big. There’s a long way to go, but their fundamental vision is that emojis are universal, hard for governments to control – so again, decentralized – and every person can have their own three, four, or five emoji moniker. It’s your email, it’s your URL, it’s what’s used to log into sites. Your universal identifier becomes these emojis because language obviously varies from place to place, but globally these emojis are universal. So right now they’re minting all these universal emojis that people can own.      Do you have one yet?      My personal one is the Statue of Liberty and a basketball. The three emoji ones, you can buy right now on their site. The two and one emojis are being auctioned off. They’re putting in this infrastructure, and I’m really bullish on them.      👍💯🏀 Thanks, Daryl. This was a blast.

42434503,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPDZXh,1622737442,DeFi's Sticky Future,"When we look back now upon the growth of the cloud computing industry, it was the arrival of cloud storage in 2006 that marked the transition from interesting new technology to essential, high growth industry. The tipping point was the creation of a simple, scalable and very useful service that could be easily plugged into existing tech start-ups.      The world of blockchain will be no different. Every industry must have such a tipping point where the product goes from curiosity to genuinely useful, which will trigger a shift from experimentation to mass adoption. When we look back at what event separated the early era of blockchain experimentation into the era of rapid adoption, it will be the arrival of decentralized finance (DeFi).    Paul Brody is EY Global Blockchain Leader. The views reflected in this article are the views of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of the global EY organization or its member firms.This is a guest essay published first in The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    What makes DeFi similar to cloud storage is the way it delivers two things we did not really have before in the world of blockchain: useful smart contracts and interoperability. Note the emphasis on useful here, because token standards and smart contracts were available before, but it wasn’t until they were applied to DeFi that we could see a real-world case for their value proposition.      In the same way that cloud storage could suddenly give a startup infinite storage capacity by plugging into an existing application, DeFi did the same for financial operations. Want to buy and sell in dollars? Stablecoins can be used anywhere. Want to set up a lending operation? You don’t need to build your own stablecoin, because you can use any of the digital currencies already out there – ERC-20 tokens, the standard for digital assets on the Ethereum blockchain, are all (theoretically) interoperable.      DeFi may prove to be particularly powerful because once people start using it, they will find it hard to stop as it gets woven into more and more of their daily business and personal activities. This is driven from the nature of DeFi innovations, which build atop each other, and how those innovations, in turn, will yield further innovations.      The process is happening right in front of us. The original building blocks of DeFi were algorithmic and fiat-backed stablecoins like MKR and USDC. From there, it was a direct step to lending and deposit contracts. The first innovation built on those innovations was yield farming, where smart contracts actively seek out the best return for your assets.    If DeFi is successful, its future is invisible, automatic and essential to every enterprise.    The world of DeFi will get bigger and stickier as off-chain assets are integrated. The European Investment Bank’s decision to issue digital notes on the Ethereum blockchain is just the start. However, stickiness isn’t just more assets or different types of assets and services, it is integration into automated business processes. Individuals and companies will start to plug their cash flows and assets into DeFi ecosystems as a routine part of their personal and business financial processes.      The most immediate example I am hoping to implement is the integration of the enterprise procurement process into DeFi. Specifically, I want to tokenize and then integrate purchase orders, receivables and product inventory. A seller should be able to obtain working capital against the value of the purchase order, and then once the product has shipped, obtain early payment on the receivables as well. At any time, companies should be able to borrow against the value of their inventory to unlock working capital.      To get there, there are a few sticky problems that need to be solved. First and foremost, companies do not want to share the identity of their suppliers or the prices they pay with the general public, so privacy is essential. At the same time, the credit-worthiness of the buyer and the history of the seller’s reliability are extremely important in pricing the credit being offered. I believe there is a big role here for zero-knowledge proofs to do things like prove the long-term payment record without sharing buyer or seller identity.    Read more: Paul Brody: This Isn’t the Revolution I Signed Up For    Assuming we can get past these problems, I expect the injection of DeFi into the enterprise workstream to be not only quick but very sticky. If you can unlock working capital in an automated way, why do it only once? Indeed, why not just build the workflow into your systems and do it with every single purchase order and invoice? Processes like this will make cash flow much more reliable and automatic for companies.      Once these types of automatic integrations are completed, they tend to stick around. The average piece of enterprise software stays in place for between six to eight years and automated processes that are plumbed into the software tend to stick along with those systems. This is also increasingly true for individuals. I have been using IFTTT.com since it was founded in 2011. I rarely log in, it just works in the background, connecting up my different systems with pre-set and programmed automations.

42434501,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPDZVh,1622729268,JPMorgan Job Posts Hint at Bank's Broader Cryptocurrency Ambitions,"JPMorgan Chase & Co. is on the hunt for crypto-savvy candidates to fill a growing number of digital asset crossover jobs.      The planned compliance, regulatory affairs and payments positions appear to stretch beyond JPMorgan’s well-documented (and aggressively hiring) Onyx blockchain project, an effort mostly concerned with wholesale banking.      Instead, the six positions, which have been hitting JPMorgan’s jobs board since at least April, speak to a financial services giant bolstering its crypto readiness on multiple fronts.      The positions at the 255,000-person company range from New Jersey to Illinois to Hong Kong.      Together, the prospective hires add some weight to JPMorgan’s gradual turnabout on digital assets. After years of CEO Jamie Dimon badmouthing bitcoin, the bank, which has never explicitly confirmed previous CoinDesk reporting that it was launching a private fund, has begun laying a broader foundation for the crypto space.      Representatives of JPMorgan declined to comment for this article.      Crypto’s most tantalizing JPM flirtation could be its status in consumer payments. Merchant Services, the firm’s $1 trillion+ annual transactions payment processing operation, is assembling a “New Payment Methods” team that will look into crypto tie-ins.      The team’s vice president would “[c]reate, gain early senior leader support and execute strategy for prioritizing, approaching and signing highest impact third-party relationships to enable product strategy surrounding new payment methods (e.g., Buy Now, Pay Later; Pay w/Points; cryptocurrencies, etc.),” according to the job post.      The wealth management, corporate banking, consumer payments and investments conglomerate is also adding a pair of “cryptocurrency risk managers” to its corporate compliance ranks. According to these job posts, issued last week, these officers will “identify, manage and mitigate risk associated with digital currencies” across multiple business lines.      They will also need to understand the ever-changing crypto regulatory landscape. Dimon called that a “serious emerging issue” in his April shareholder letter. He has repeatedly warned of, and even called for, closer regulation of crypto in the U.S.    Read more: JPMorgan to Let Clients Invest in Bitcoin Fund for First Time: Sources    Much of the activity in crypto and decentralized finance (DeFi) comes from outside the U.S. – especially in Asia. JPMorgan is keen to follow crypto’s legal tack in that key region, too. In mid-May it began searching for a regulatory affairs associate to monitor the changing goal posts for “digital assets” and other technologies in the Asia-Pacific region.      Despite its newcomer status in the crypto asset ecosystem, JPMorgan has for years pursued adjacent ventures in blockchain technology. Developers are exploring tokenized asset collateralization and cross-border payments using the bank’s JPMCoin.      Even in Onyx, the fast-growing blockchain division building JPM coin and other projects atop a privacy-centric version of Ethereum called Quorum – once owned by JPM, now owned by ConsenSys – recent job posts are taking uncommonly direct aim at cryptocurrencies.      A mid-May post for a “Senior Digital Assets Platform Engineering Lead” calls for candidates who understand proof-of-stake consensus mechanisms and experience with ethereum and bitcoin, the latter being “a huge plus.”      A source familiar with the matter said the role is not related to a specific project, but a general hire meant to “strengthen our overall engineering development team.” The source downplayed the possibility that a “digital assets platform” is in the works.

The function of the integration is to allow users to avoid skyrocketing gas fees on Ethereum, which have gotten so high they are pricing some smaller players out of the burgeoning DeFi space.      Users can now withdraw any of the 13 available trading ERC-20 assets (including ETH, UNI, USDT, LINK, COMP and more) from their Okcoin wallet to Polygon’s sidechain. In doing so, users can save up to 25% on gas fees because they no longer have to bridge their assets from an exchange to an Ethereum wallet to Polygon, incurring two transaction fees for using the token bridge.    Read more: AU21 Capital Opens $21M Polygon Ecosystem Fund    “Polygon has gotten tremendous early traction as a scaling solution and has taken the lead in scaling Ethereum,” said Okcoin COO Jason Lau. “Projects and users have both flocked to take advantage of the benefits it offers through much faster and cheaper ERC transactions. It’s seen both assets and transactions increase dramatically since the beginning of the year. Projects like Aave, Sushiswap, Balancer and 1inch also have integrations, so there’s a free flow through the Polygon network.”    Removing friction    Lau said this integration makes it quicker to get assets onto Polygon with one-click withdrawals. Transactions are also cheaper because users can skip their own wallets and move assets directly to Polygon.      The user experience is also more streamlined, with Okcoin handling the complexities of bridging assets between the base layer and layer 2.      Lau pointed out that high gas fees are driven by Ethereum's own increasing popularity, and Polygon is the one of the major players helping to scale the network. He said Okcoin’s integration with Polygon will make it easier to access layer 2 DeFi applications, with convenient payment rails such as debit, credit, Apple Pay and ACH.      The next steps involve giving users open access to the Polygon ecosystem for things like yield farming. This would essentially let users farm on Sushiswap, for example, directly via Okcoin, similar to the current Okcoin Earn function. With Earn, Okcoin covers gas fees and users can deposit stablecoin assets into DeFi liquidity protocols to earn annual percentage yield from protocols such as Curve, Yearn.Finance and Compound.      With the Polygon integration users can bypass the process of having to deposit funds to their ETH wallet, then transfer funds from Ethereum to Polygon, then go, for example, to Sushiswap or Curve, find a yield offer and invest: They can do it all from the Okcoin platform.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | MATIC | SUSHI,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/06/03/okcoin-integrates-with-polygon-to-reduce-users-ethereum-gas-fees,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/aa42ab1fc4eb43edadcdf23f81cd238f0e9e8918-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434497,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPDZJh,1622726185,Russian Political Activists Urge Supporters to Learn About Crypto,"The team of Alexei Navalny, the imprisoned opposition leader in Russia, will from now on only take donations in cryptocurrencies, said Leonid Volkov, head of Navalny’s volunteer network.      In a video address to Navalny's supporters on Wednesday, Volkov said the activists are keeping on with their work despite the recent wave of repression against Navalny and his allies, and are still in need of financial support. But the traditional financial system, which can be fully monitored by the state, is a bad intermediary on which to rely, Volkov said.      ""If the authorities are pushing us out of fundraising via the banking system, we will be patiently teaching everyone to use cryptocurrencies and learn ourselves,"" he said, adding:      ""Cryptocurrencies are a real substitution for money; it's not a toy. Their advantage is that they are not controlled by any central banks or governments. So it's hard or even impossible for the governments to track them.""      Volkov's bitcoin wallet dedicated to donations has received over 660 BTC since 2016, and more than one full bitcoin since April, according to the blockchain data.    Avoiding protest retribution    Alexei Navalny, a vocal opponent of Russia President Vladimir Putin, was poisoned last autumn by a chemical weapon, then arrested after he survived. After his arrest, a series of protests ensued and bitcoin donations to the network of Navalny's allies surged.      In May, Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK) was labeled an extremist organization by a Russian court. Although the process is still ongoing, the organization disbanded in advance to avoid exposing activists to potential criminal charges, should the initial ruling stand.      Even occasional supporters of Navalny might be subject to persecution: A new draft bill introduced in the Russian parliament in May suggests that anyone linked to an extremist organization won't be able to run in any future elections.      Russian authorities have already taken a harsh stance against anyone backing Navalny. In May, a database of people who registered on a website dedicated to a protest rally in his support was stolen. Subsequently, participants were deanonymized and some lost their jobs.      In this situation, crypto can be a way for people to support Navalny's cause but avoid being reprimanded, Volkov said in the video.      ""Crypto is not an illegal version of a bank transfer; it's a legal and safe replacement for cash. Cryptocurrencies, in fact, are very far away from criminal activities. They started as a mathematical game, but now even big companies and progressive entrepreneurs started using them,"" he said, pointing to Elon Musk as an example.      Volkov also gave a brief explanation about anonymity in crypto and recommended that people new to cryptocurrencies start with buying a small amount on a big centralized exchange. In the description of a video, there is a bitcoin wallet address, a link to the major centralized exchange Binance and the number of Volkov's account there for donations.      ""If you're not planning to use crypto, it won't hurt to just have a wallet with some amount in it,"" he says in the video. ""You don't have to buy a whole bitcoin. Try and see that it's not hard at all. No need to afraid of cryptocurrencies; very soon, they will become a part of our life just as ordinary money is. And if we can be one step ahead of the government in this, we should use this chance.""

42434500,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPDZPh,1622725200,Crypto Credit Rating Firm Credmark Pivots to Modeling DeFi Protocol Risks,"After years of creating credit reports on the crypto-lending industry, crypto credit data company Credmark is pivoting to risk-scoring decentralized protocols to provide accounting-level data for the decentralized finance (DeFi) space.      After a $5.5 million raise from investors including Solidity Ventures, Genesis Block Ventures, Spark Digital Capital and others, Credmark is partnering with oracle provider API3 to launch a decentralized platform for risk models that will try to score decentralized finance projects, said Momin Ahmad, chief strategy officer at Credmark. As part of the raise, Credmark now counts employees from Coinbase, Moody’s, API3, Bridge Mutual and a former FICO executive among its advisers.    The DeFi pivot    Credmark has spent three years trying to develop a system by which it could assign credit scores to individual crypto users, as well as research and analysis on the crypto lending industry, through its quarterly ""Crypto Credit Reports"". These reports included analysis of proprietary data from centralized crypto lenders such as BlockFi, Nexo and Celsius, as well as public data from DeFi protocols.      The centralized lenders had accounting teams and detailed spreadsheets, and Ahmad was able to inquire about how much collateral was kept at each lender versus how much collateral was rehypothecated.      “When I went to DeFi I found that level of nuance just does not exist at all,” Ahmad said. “Doing both led us to the conclusion that there were a handful of problems, particularly in DeFi, that needed to be addressed before something like a credit score or even other risk management tools can properly work.”      That kind of information allows centralized lenders to do a portion of their loans as one-to-one collateralized or undercollateralized loans, Ahmad said.      “In order to get to a point where you can do true, peer-to-peer, permissionless, under-collateralized lending, you need to make sure that the data interpretation is a little more robust,” he said.      In the meantime, without better data all DeFi is left with is overcollateralization, Ahmad said. Credmark now aims to make DeFi more friendly for less crypto-savvy retail users by risk scoring DeFi protocols.      “As new users arrive to DeFi, it is fair to assume they will not have the same appetite for risk as the current user,” said Serge Ugarte, former vice president of global business development at FICO and a newly added Credmark adviser. “Providing this new retail user with tools to mitigate downside will be crucial in order to maintain a healthy ecosystem.”    Using data sets and oracles to create risk models    Credmark will combine already-indexed data sources like The Graph and Dune Analytics with blockchain data from Trueblocks, which does heavy computations to rebuild the blockchain at a certain point in time so users can have essentially what would be accounting data from the blockchain, Ahmad said.      The company will also use Nix, an operating system where retail users can see the environment in which that data was recorded. On Nix, users can gain access to Credmark’s data, feed it into its risk model, and verify for themselves that the way in which the model rated a protocol was accurate.      In the future, Credmark plans to create a way for other users to submit their own risk models. When the platform matures, API3 oracles will feed the risk model results data to any smart contract protocol that requires trustless on-chain data.      “Our first tool will create ranges on Uniswap v.3 pools and will invest funds accordingly,” Ahmad said. “The later models might be suggestive or automated.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | MINING,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/06/03/crypto-credit-rating-firm-credmark-pivots-to-modeling-defi-protocol-risks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/33448a94ae180bd1a784d20bd3c304d0dc7240cd-2560x1920.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Anchorage already provides bitcoin-backed loans through other capital providers, including Silvergate Bank, and is looking to provide institutional clients bank-grade loans on their ethereum as well.      Crypto-lending startups have offered ethereum-backed loans for some time – ETH makes up 27% of Genesis’ loan book – but this seems to be the first time ETH-backed loans have been extended through an FDIC-insured bank.      “A lot of clients have ethereum that’s highly appreciated, and they can’t get liquidity because no one extends them credit on those assets,” Anchorage co-founder Diogo Mónica said.      In July 2019, BankProv said it was going to begin banking digital-asset firms with the help of compliance firm Treliant and Bitfury’s blockchain analytics platform, Crystal.      With $1.5 billion in assets, BankProv is smaller than some better-known crypto-friendly banks such as Silvergate and Signature. It has, however, recruited from other banks that have worked in the digital-asset industry, including Radius Bank and Metropolitan Commercial Bank.    See also: Cryptocurrency Custodian Anchorage Adds Five More DeFi Tokens    Anchorage has had the ability to extend ETH-backed loans to its clients, but forming partnerships with other banks is allowing it to scale its crypto-backed lending product, Mónica said.      “On a daily basis there are more banks coming in,” he said.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | FIAT,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/06/03/anchorage-to-offer-ethereum-backed-loans-through-bankprov,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/15c5a8c87ef18e5e5e577907ad22585b35a44772-1340x844.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Insurance in crypto is rare, and providing peace of mind within the experimental DeFi space is limited to a handful of solutions, such as Nexus Mutual’s decentralized risk pool approach.

But despite signs of a breakout, some analysts remain cautious.    Bitcoin has risen 8% this week to trade above $38,500, according to CoinDesk 20 data.  Crypto funds are deploying newly subscribed capital, which seems to be pushing the cryptocurrency higher, according to Stack Funds' co-founder and COO Matthew Dibb.  Limited Partners ""are buying the dip, and the new start date for capital deployment/allocation is generally the first day of month,"" Dibb told CoinDesk.  The rally appears to be a low-leverage, spot-driven move. Funding rates – the cost of holding long positions in the perpetual futures – remain close to zero, according to data provider Glassnode. A high funding rate is taken to represent excess leverage on the bullish side.  The daily chart shows the cryptocurrency has broken out of its two-week-long symmetrical triangle (congestion) pattern and further gains may be in the offing.  ""Bitcoin is looking much better technically,"" Dibb said. ""However, we would need to see a weekly close above the previous short-term high of $40,904 to regain confidence of a resumed uptrend."" The weekly close is Sunday at UTC 23:59.  Pankaj Balani, co-founder and CEO of the Singapore-based Delta Exchange, expects recovery rallies to be short-lived.  ""We expect selling to resume and large supply being offered above $45,000,"" Balani said.

According to a report by Bloomberg on Wednesday, Santa Clara County (Calif.) Superior Court Judge Sunil R. Kulkarni said YouTube and its parent company Google were protected under federal law from responsibility for their users' posts.      Wozniak alleged the publisher allowed the use of his image and sold targeted ads to drive traffic to the videos, falsely authenticating the YouTube channels disseminating the videos. Wozniak was one of 18 plaintiffs who filed suit against YouTube last year seeking punitive damages. The suit alleged the image and likeness of other well-known entrepreneurs, including Bill Gates, Elon Musk and Michael Dell, were also being exploited in these scams.      Wozniak attempted to challenge Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, the federal law protecting social media platforms from being sued for their users' content. Judge Kulkarni said the law protected YouTube.      The videos promoted a dubious ""bitcoin giveaway scam"" that promised to double a user's funds after they sent an initial amount to a wallet address via QR code.      Multiple celebrities have been targeted and used to promote such scams over the years. In 2020, the identities of Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin and Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, founders of the U.S.-based Gemini exchange, were used to lure people into giving up their crypto.

Chia has asked journalist Chris Dupres, the founder of thechiaplot.net, to discontinue the use of the company's name because it violates trademark law. Dupres' attorney, Paul Alan Levy from Public Citizen, responded with a fiery letter Wednesday to Chia's head of IP Belle Borovik, insisting the blog name was not misleading.      ""Just how gullible do you expect your customers to be?"" wrote Levy in the letter, which was linked to a Dupres' blog post. ""I daresay that even the proverbial moron in a hurry would be able to recognize, immediately upon visiting The Chia Plot, that this is a website devoted to journalism about your company rather than being sponsored by your company.""      Chia is arguing the unauthorized use of its trademark ""exposes community members to potential scammers, misleading and confusing them."" The blog is only around two weeks old.      On May 25, the project sent a letter to Dupres outlining the concerns over the use of the name ""Chia"" citing the ""unauthorized use of Chia Network’s registered ... mark,"" or logos.      The project subsequently asked Dupres to respond, which he did via Levy, stating he would not back down from the use of the name.      ""Dupres is not going to comply,"" wrote Levy, who went on to say Chia had no right to authorize the use of an ""unregistered"" trademark against websites discussing Chia.      See also: Blockchain Platform Chia Raises $61M From a16z, Others at $500M Valuation: Report      Levy also cited 10 years' worth of precedent trademark case law where companies threatening or pursuing legal action had failed.

Dupres is not willing to keep operating his website subject to the threat of alleged trademark damages.      ""Failing a prompt retraction, a request for waiver of service could well be the next communication you receive on this topic,"" wrote Levy.
