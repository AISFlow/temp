42384301,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAPHbf,1596224375,Bitcoin’s Option Market Is Now Skewed Bullish,"Bitcoin’s price jumped to a fresh 11-month high on Friday, with the options market betting on a sustained bull move.    The top cryptocurrency by market cap rose to a high of $11,467 during the U.S. trading hours, surpassing the previous multi-high month high of $11,394 reached on Monday.  Bitcoin has rallied 24% in July and looks overbought as per the 14-day Relative Strength Index, a widely tracked technical indicator.  Options market data shows sentiment is quite bullish. Options are derivative contracts that give the purchases the right but not the obligation to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call option represents the right to buy and the put options gives the buyer the right to sell.  The one-, three- and six-month put-call skews, which measure the price of puts relative to that of calls, are negative. This is a sign calls, or bullish bets, are drawing higher value than puts, or bearish bets.  Investors appear to be selling more put options and buying call options because the put-call open interest ratio that measures the number of put options (or bearish bets) open against calls (or bullish bets) has risen to a two-month high of 0.63, according to data source Skew.    The put-call open interest ratio looks to have risen from 0.50 to 0.63 this week due to greater selling in put options.      With the combination of negative skews and a rising put-call open interest ratio, bitcoin’s latest move above $10,000 looks like it can be sustained.

42384297,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAPHZ9,1596222180,Officials Arrest 3 Allegedly Behind Twitter Hack,"The FBI and local officials have arrested three individuals who allegedly committed the largest hack in Twitter’s history.      Florida resident Graham Clark was arrested Friday morning, according to Florida news channel WFLA. State Attorney Andrew Warren filed 30 felony charges, including organized fraud, communications fraud, fraudulent use of personal information and access to computer or electronic devices without authority, WFLA reported.      Federal officials are also charging Nima Fazeli and Mason John Sheppard with aiding in the ""intentional access of a protected computer"" and conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering, according to criminal complaints published Friday.      Warren intends to try Clark, who is 17 years old, as an adult; Florida law allows minors to be charged as adults in some financial fraud cases.      The Twitter hack compromised the accounts of top cryptocurrency exchanges, and prominent crypto twitter accounts (including CoinDesk), before moving on to mainstream accounts including Elon Musk, Warren Buffet, Kanye West, Joe Biden and former President Barack Obama.      Overall 130 accounts were compromised, according to Twitter.      The accounts all tweeted a bitcoin scam, promising to double senders bitcoin if they sent them to a specific address. It only netted the hackers about $120,000. The hack went on for hours, highlighted extensive security breaches, and led to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey being added to the others testifying before a congressional anti-trust hearing.      In a tweet Friday, Twitter said, “We appreciate the swift actions of law enforcement in this investigation and will continue to cooperate as the case progresses.”      The Federal Bureau of Investigation, Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Secret Service, Florida law enforcement and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California assisted in the investigation, according to Warren's press release.    ‘Breathtaking impact’    In an effort to stop the hackers, Twitter locked some verified accounts out, stopping them from changing their password, or being able to tweet. CoinDesk was one such account, and we did not regain our ability to tweet again until Thursday, over a week after the hack. With as much access as the hackers seemingly had, security experts were particularly concerned about the security of accounts direct messages.      The day after the hack, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) said he met with Dorsey privately in 2018 and discussed implementing end-to-end encryption of users’ direct messages. Wyden says Dorsey told him at the time that Twitter was working on encrypted DMs, but by 2020, it was clear the company hadn’t delivered.      “This is a vulnerability that has lasted for far too long, and one that is not present in other, competing platforms. If hackers gained access to users’ DMs, this breach could have a breathtaking impact for years to come,” Wyden said in a statement.      Thirty-six accounts, including CoinDesk, were told by Twitter that the hackers had the ability to access their DMs.      Twitter has previously said the attackers downloaded account information from eight victims, though none of those victims were verified.      Reuters also reported over 1,000 employees and contractors, or nearly a fifth of the company, had access to the tools that were used to access the accounts.      “We fell behind, both in our protections against social engineering of our employees and restrictions on our internal tools,” Dorsey told investors on a Twitter earnings call in July.      In a tweet Thursday, Twitter gave further details about how the attack occurred.      “The attack on July 15, 2020, targeted a small number of employees through a phone spear phishing attack,” the company tweeted. “This attack relied on a significant and concerted attempt to mislead certain employees and exploit human vulnerabilities to gain access to our internal systems.”      In the days following the hack, reporting from numerous outlets not only followed the flow of where the money was going, by tracking the bitcoin wallet the funds were sent to, but also started to unwind the story behind the hack.      Numerous hackers flipped on “Kirk”, as identified by the New York Times, who was selling access to a Twitter admin panel. They allegedly bailed after larger account takeovers spooked them, given the likelihood that compromising such accounts would attract law enforcement attention.      Given that the FBI was on the case from the start, as CoinDesk reported, those concerns seem to have played out.

42394465,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvktF7,1596216996,Money Reimagined: Let’s Be Privacy Scolds,"Michael Casey is on vacation this week. The following essay was written by Marc Hochstein, CoinDesk’s executive editor.  Once, I pried into a stranger’s affairs for no good reason at all.  This happened almost 20 years ago, but the story offers an important lesson for those shaping the future of money today.  My wife took a work trip to another city and I tagged along for fun. The day before her conference, we strolled around some posh neighborhood and I noticed a particularly impressive mansion. Who owns it, I wondered, scribbling down the address.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk’s newsletters here.  On my own the next day, instead of going to a museum or a park like any normal, sane tourist would do, I went to the county recorder’s office. After an hour of waiting in lines and being sent from one rabbit-warren office to another, I obtained a copy of the property’s mortgage. It showed that the house was held by a trust with a generic name, obscuring the owner’s identity.  Knowing what I was like back then, I probably got all high and mighty. How dare this mysterious rich person hide behind a file folder, I would have thundered. Property ownership is a matter of public interest!  But, truthfully, it was none of my business who owned the place.  To be clear: I had nothing nefarious in mind. I wasn’t on a news assignment, I didn’t live in the same city, much less the same neighborhood, nor was I in the market to buy (certainly not in that price range). I was just nosy.  To borrow from Bob Dylan, I spoke the word “transparency” just like a wedding vow. I was so much dumber then, I’m smarter than that now.  If you’re expecting me to segue into an argument about how blockchains fix this, you’re wrong. Blockchains don’t fix this. Blockchains could make this much, much worse.  Stalker’s paradise  By “this” I mean not only the natural but regrettable human tendency to eavesdrop, gawk and rubberneck. I also mean the baffling, widespread assumption that once an individual’s sensitive personal information slips into the public domain, we owe them no courtesy to ignore or keep it discreet.  Riddle me this: If Alice forgets to lock the bathroom door and Bob barges in without knocking, who’s at fault? Let’s pray that none of the people who blame Alice work in government, media or blockchain analytics.  As many readers know, bitcoin and most other cryptocurrencies are pseudonymous – up to a point. Instead of an account tied to your name you control a pseudonymous address, a long string of letters and numbers. You can generate as many of these alphanumeric addresses as you want. Better than a Swiss numbered account, right?  Except every transfer of crypto from A to B is broadcast to the network, and once confirmed it's recorded on the shared ledger, more permanent than a tattoo. There’s a booming industry of on-chain sleuthing outfits that analyze spending patterns and relationships between addresses, deducing which ones belong to the same users and where the money is moving.  Chainalysis, Elliptic and other vendors do this work, not out of morbid curiosity but to help law enforcement catch criminals. The auditability of blockchains has also been useful to individual users and journalists tracking stolen funds when crypto exchanges get hacked.  All well and good. Yet, it’s easy to imagine how peeping Toms could take advantage of this feature to spy on unsuspecting innocents, if they haven’t already. Neophytes who neglect to cover their tracks, for example by sharing their addresses publicly and reusing them, would be easy prey. It’s unsettling enough how much you can find out about someone in 10 minutes of googling. Now add financial transactions, which perhaps say more about people than anything else, to the mix. If crypto achieves mass adoption before privacy leaks are fixed, the result could be a stalker’s paradise.  Over the years, the developers of Bitcoin and other protocols have made valiant efforts to improve the networks’ privacy, and privacy coins such as monero and zcash were created specifically to strengthen transactional anonymity. God bless them all.  But technical solutions may not arrive quickly enough, or suffice when they do. And it would be foolish to rely on legal protections. (Earlier this month, a federal appeals court ruled the U.S. government did not need a warrant to search a suspect’s transactions on his personal Coinbase account, much less publicly available blockchain data).  New norms needed  New cultural norms around respect for individual privacy are needed as well. The backlash against Google Glass more than half a decade ago was encouraging in this regard. But it seems to have been the exception in a world where, thanks to ubiquitous camera phones and promiscuous content sharing, simply leaving the house runs the risk of acquiring unwanted fame.  The Wall Street Journal editorial page often uses the term “privacy scolds” to describe those who object to mass surveillance and data sharing. It’s funny, because scolds are people who tend to disregard others’ privacy.  But let’s embrace the label. Let’s be privacy scolds.  Don’t shame the celebrity who looks “fat” in a bathing suit or the random pedestrian with poor fashion sense; shame the hall-monitor types who take pictures without getting consent first, the de facto pornographers who disseminate the images (be it in supermarket tabloids or social media) and the ghouls who lap them up.  “You’re in a public place, maaaan, there’s no right to privacy.” Maybe not, but there is a reasonable expectation of decency.  And so it goes with financial transactions on a blockchain. By all means, use sophisticated tracing capabilities to find the hackers who infiltrated Twitter, commandeered prominent accounts and scammed some of their followers into sending bitcoin. But if, in the course of such investigations, you stumble upon someone else’s embarrassing, but innocuous, transactions, don’t tweet it with the “big eyes” emoji. Ignore it and forget it. It may be public information, maaaan, but it’s nobody’s business.  I’ll tell you one more story. A bank once sent me another customer’s statement in the mail by accident. The second I realized it wasn’t mine, I stuffed the paper right back in the envelope and walked it over to the local branch.  I wasn’t even tempted to look at the balance. Of that much I’m proud.  A dollar is not a dollar  By Galen Moore, CoinDesk senior research analyst  The dollar continued weakening this week, dropping below year-to-date lows.  But demand for tether (USDT), a stablecoin (maybe) backed 1:1 with actual U.S. dollars or securities, continued to strengthen. Supply crossed 11 billion on Wednesday.  Why would demand for a dollar-pegged stablecoin grow while the dollar falls?  It could be simply due to the need for more dollars to buy the equivalent amount of crypto. Or, it could be due to traders exploiting an arbitrage opportunity on off-shore bitcoin futures markets. On OKEx, one of the most liquid of such markets, cost basis (i.e., the difference between cash and futures prices) crossed 20% as the bitcoin spot price ran up.  Meanwhile, the old-fashioned dollar is still in high demand around the world. In Havana, the government's demand for dollars led it to open ""dollar stores,"" where goods are offered (and not at a discount) to coax out the physical cash dollars Cubans have been holding from remittances. Meanwhile, in Lagos and Abuja, Nigerian manufacturers can't get the dollars they need to buy raw materials.  In other words, a dollar is not a dollar is not a dollar. Its price reflects its use and context. On a blockchain, it may be in demand because it has more uses. For example, tether is a way for traders to access crypto exchanges. Not everyone can do that with ordinary dollars.  Global town hall  By Pete Pachal, CoinDesk executive editor for Operations and Strategy  BIG TECH VS. WASHINGTON. In a bit of political theater made for the Age of COVID, the CEOs of four of the world’s most valuable tech companies appeared from their executive lairs via video screen before the U.S. Congress this week to face harsh questioning about antitrust concerns. Lawmakers peppered Apple’s Tim Cook, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, Google’s Sundar Pichai and Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg with intense made-for-TV questions about everything from Google’s allegedly very shady treatment of Yelp to Amazon’s practice of offering its own version of products that happen to sell really well on Amazon.  Even though Apple and Amazon were the biggest dogs in the show with more than $3 trillion in combined market cap, Facebook and Google were hit hardest, with Zuckerberg and Pichai each fielding queries 16 times, compared to Bezos’ 13 and Cook’s seven, according to VentureBeat. Chalk it up to posturing or genuine concern, but the disparity reflects just how dicey being an ad-based information (and sometimes misinformation) platform can be.  While user engagement for both isn’t dropping, skepticism about the surveillance capitalism business model is clearly growing. Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), who chaired the committee, is an advocate of breaking up Facebook. While that seems unlikely today, this week’s hearings at least showed Congress, which Zuckeberg seemed to easily deflect back in 2018, had upped its game for creating a dialogue about Big Tech.  BITCOIN’S FUTURE. Forget for a second that the value of bitcoin recently blasted past the $11K mark – the first time it has crossed the mark in roughly a year. There were at least three other signs this week that the original cryptocurrency is maturing. For starters, the creator of the Lightning network unveiled a promising way to greatly reduce the size of nodes in the network – potentially a big step toward scalability.  Around the same time, Fidelity Digital Assets, an early institutional mover in crypto, published “Bitcoin Investment Thesis: An Aspirational Store of Value.” Global economics and monetary policy (money printer go “brrrr” et al.), it says, have led to growing interest in bitcoin and that it may be a valuable asset even if it’s never really used as “currency” at scale. Not the boldest observations, but the fact that they’re coming from such a mainstream source is notable, and encouraging!  Finally, a federal court ruled that bitcoin is, in fact, money. Judge Beryl A. Howell wrote that money ""commonly means a medium of exchange, method of payment, or store of value,” and that bitcoin ticks all those boxes. For now the ruling’s main effect is to ensure money-laundering charges against Larry Harmon, the operator of an unlicensed bitcoin trading platform, weren’t dismissed, but it’s nonetheless an important milestone for bitcoin – even if you can’t quite buy coffee with it just yet.  NEW STIMULUS, MINUS DIGITAL DOLLAR. Republicans and Democrats in Congress have proposed wildly different coronavirus stimulus bills, but there’s one thing they do agree on: stimulus checks. According to this expertly visualized breakdown from The New York Times, both plans allocate hundreds of billions in direct payments to Americans. That’s all well and good, though the last time we did this many people didn’t receive their checks until weeks or months after the bill was signed into law. (See the “where is my stimulus check” search terms on Google.) In the spring, there were proposals for a digital dollar to address various weaknesses in the system, including the need to disburse a vast sum of money securely and quickly. So the question is: Has there been any progress, or was all that talk of “Digital Dollar Account Wallets” just pie-in-the-sky digital utopian coffee house chatter? How about it, Reps. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) and Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.)?

Relevant reads  Ethereum at Five. CoinDesk celebrated Ethereum’s fifth birthday with a week-long series of features, pop-up newsletters and live video events. Included in the package was this look at Ethereum culture, a colorful retrospective on the 2016 DAO hack, and this in-depth explainer about Etherum 2.0, a major upgrade that will see the blockchain switch to a Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. A highly ambitious project, Ethereum has faced plenty of doubters over the years, not least from the Bitcoin community. This week proved that Ethereum has energy to burn and enough developer interest to keep it riding ahead for some time yet.  What Crypto Lender Celsius Isn’t Telling Its Depositors. Crypto lender Celsius is making uncollateralized loans, on a limited basis, contradicting the claims of its founder, Alex Mashinsky, according to an investigative piece by CoinDesk’s Nathan DiCamillo. “Celsius’ total uncollateralized loans are less than a fraction of 1 percent out of tens of thousands of loans issued since 2018,” a Celsius representative said. But uncollateralized lending may be only one of several practices that the firm has downplayed or not shared with depositors – including the rehypothecation of a collateral borrowers pledge.  Central Banks Are Privacy Providers of Last Resort. As central banks look to issue digital currencies (CBDCs), they’re being thrown into a debate about financial privacy rights, says CoinDesk columnist J.P. Koning. On the one hand, it’s probably good for private citizens that banks are paying attention to this topic. On the other, these institutions are unprepared to be consumer advocates and face the type of privacy-related scrutiny encountered by Facebook and other powerful internet entities.  China Aims to Be the World’s Dominant Blockchain Power – With Help From Google, Amazon and Microsoft. No other nation has blockchain goals like China. The emerging superpower is rolling out a digital currency, and its Blockchain-based Service Network aims to be the dominant internet provider for decentralized applications. China sees blockchain tech as a tool to take on U.S. financial hegemony, as we said last week. So it’s somewhat surprising that American companies like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft and Google are among the major cloud service providers for BSN’s data centers. “The world is clearly becoming a ‘splinternet’ with national boundaries and domestic regulations overturning the previous ‘techno globalism’ motif,” James Mulnevon, director of intelligence integration at SOS International, commented.  Why Bitcoin Is Protected by the First Amendment. Justin Wales, co-chair of Carlton Fields’ national blockchain and virtual currency practice, said Bitcoin is protected under the First Amendment. “We’ve all heard the phrase ‘Money is Speech,’ which stems from the U.S. Supreme Court’s recognition that the use of money can itself be an expressive act. One has a right to donate to a political party because we view that type of spending not as financial, but as communicative. Because of Bitcoin, money is no longer restrained to a dollar’s limitations. Accordingly, the range of expression one is capable of has been expanded because money has taken on a more useful form,” he writes.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,"Marc Hochstein, Galen Moore, Pete Pachal",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/07/31/money-reimagined-lets-be-privacy-scolds,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ba25213b20973a3ec1cc59e42b743045c4764d2a-1700x1133.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384279,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAERvD,1596213598,"Blockchain Bites: Dollar's Decline, Ether's Moneymakers and Coinbase's Considerations","The Securities and Exchange Commission appears to be interested in Binance’s eponymous blockchain, 132% of ether wallets are in profit and the Bank of Japan is getting serious about CBDC R&D.      You’re reading Blockchain Bites, the daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news, and why they’re significant. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk’s newsletters here.    Top shelf    Binance Sleuths The SEC appears to be gearing up for a closer look at Binance coin (BNB) and other tokens on cryptocurrency exchange giant Binance’s eponymous blockchain. The U.S. securities regulator disclosed in a Wednesday memo its intention to award Menlo Park, Calif.-based CipherTrace a single-source contract (because it's the only blockchain analysis firm capable of tracing Binance Chain transactions). CipherTrace previously partnered with Binance to bring anti-money laundering tracing tools to Binance Chain.      Coinbase Considering Coinbase is considering listing ampleforth, hedera hashgraph, blockstack and 16 other digital assets in the cryptocurrency exchange’s latest exploratory review. On Friday, The San Francisco-based exchange announced it will evaluate 19 additional cryptocurrencies against its ""Digital Asset Framework"" for potential inclusion on its popular trading platform. The announcement did not state a timeline and gave no guarantees on ""whether or when"" any of the contenders would actually be listed.      Splinternet The Blockchain-based Service Network (BSN), a state-backed digital infrastructure project in China, aims to be the dominant internet services provider for decentralized applications (dapps). BSN’s global expansion is built using U.S. technologies, another possible vector in the tense U.S.-China trade war. Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft and Google are among the major cloud service providers for BSN’s overseas data centers. “The world is clearly becoming a ‘splinternet’ with national boundaries and domestic regulations overturning the previous ‘techno globalism’ motif,” said James Mulnevon, director of intelligence integration at SOS International.      Music Makers Audius, a streaming service that connects music fans directly with artists, has raised $3.1 million in a strategic round co-led by Multicoin Capital and Blockchange Ventures, with participation from Pantera Capital and Coinbase Ventures. Audius has now raised a total of $8.6 million as the platform prepares for prime time, having grown in less than a year to more than 250,000 monthly users and 40,000 artists. EDM artists seem to be the site’s burgeoning specialty with notables including RAC, deadmau5, Lido, 3LAU, Zeds Dead, Mr. Carmack and REZZ all signed on. The blockchain use case for music is a familiar one: the inequity and tardiness of the revenue model of streaming services like Apple Music and Spotify.      In Profit Profitable ether addresses have grown by a hefty 132% since last July. In the last week, ether has established a foothold above $300 for the first time in 12 months. While the second-largest cryptocurrency is trading with only a relatively small price increase year-on-year, the number of profit-making or “in the money” ether addresses has more than doubled to 31.37 million from 13.5 million over that time, according to blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock. The numbers indicate many took advantage of the opportunity to buy ether under $300, resulting in almost 18 million more in-profit addresses.    Quick bites  Elrond mainnetted and cut its token supply from 20 billion to 20 million.  KeeperDAO raises seven-figure seed round from Polychain, Three Arrows.  Why oracles are key to DeFi.  The history of Ethereum in five charts.  Twitter employees were spearphished.  At stake    It seems like every day or so the Bank of Japan, the nation’s central bank, is pushing forward with plans for a central bank digital currency (CBDC).      Friday, it was reported the BoJ’s most senior economist will lead the department responsible for CBDC research and development. This department has been involved in a digital currency working group alongside five other central banks since the start of the year, and runs a task force to study CBDC implications.      This bit of news comes on the heels of another senior official who said digital currency research was a ""top priority"" for the central bank.      Analysts, and members of the BoJ itself, have noted the context. China has taken the lead in CBDC development – with major retailers and ecommerce giants involved in plans to test what’s officially known as the DC/EP.      While Japan is testing a digital yen and involved in European Central Bank research to study DLT’s use in global financial infrastructure, it has no definitive plans to use it.      Yet, a digital yen could be a welcome change for a nation whose economy draws constant comparisons to the living dead. In 2009, the Wall Street Journal said Tokyo’s efforts to bring “Japan’s dead economy” back to life created a Frankenstein monster. The concept of “zombie companies,” those that bring in only enough revenue to finance their debts, was dreamt up to describe Japanese firms.      The BoJ has always been willing to experiment. But these attempts at resurrecting a deflationary economy have met with mixed results. Negative interest rates and the central bank’s policy of buying corporate exchange-traded funds (a novel strategy the U.S. Federal Reserve is considering) haven’t spurred growth or brought the nation out of its three decade long “lost decade.”      While a CBDC could give more granular control over monetary policy and maybe leading to further economic experiments, it likely isn’t a solution in itself.    Market intel    July Jubilee Bitcoin may have its best July in eight years and confirm a major bullish breakout in the process. Bitcoin is trading near $11,190 at press time, up nearly 22% this month, according to data from CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price index. The cryptocurrency now needs to hold above $11,145 till Friday's close (in UTC time) to confirm the biggest July gain (at 22%) since 2012, when prices rallied by 40%. If bitcoin closes below $11,050, the resulting monthly gain would be less than the 21% rise seen in July 2018.      Summer Bummer? Meanwhile, the dollar has dropped to its lowest level since May 2018 as the Federal Reserve said it plans to keep interest rates close to zero. The dollar’s trade-weighted index – a measure of its value relative to a basket of other dominant currencies – dropped to $93.04 Thursday afternoon. The last time the index traded this low was on May 15, 2018, according to TradingView.      Aave's Wave Aave’s lend token has rallied by 23% in the past 24 hours and is trading at $0.3440 at press time, according to data source Messari. It's the day's top performer among cryptocurrencies with at least $100 million market capitalization. On Wednesday, the protocol announced the Aavenomics Proposal, a plan to transition to decentralized governance by token holders, featuring a liquidity-mining rewards system similar to the one that helped drive growth recently in Compound, a rival decentralized lender.    Opinion    Too Big to Fail Jenny Leung, a blockchain and fintech attorney at Blakemore Fallon PLLC dba Ketsal, thinks social media firms have become too big to fail. During the COVID-19 crisis, the recent civil rights protests and Twitter hack, social media institutions showed that “their failure would pose a significant threat to society due to their outsized influence, size, reach, society’s co-dependence on them and ‘their power to shape the interpretation of public events,’” she writes. If Wall Street giants are systemically important financial institutions (SIFI), then firms like Twitter and Facebook have become systemically important social media institutions (SISMI).

Firms dealing with virtual currencies need to be especially careful as their services might be used to launder funds collected from illicit activity, the regulator said.  The advisory added attackers have been using phishing emails, malware and ransomware to carry out such attacks.  Referring to last month’s massive Twitter hack, FinCEN said the cybercrime techniques could also be applied to a larger attack involving social media.  That attack, which took over multiple big-name Twitter handles, involved a scam message seeking bitcoin for COVID-19 relief that would supposedly be doubled and donated.  According to a list of red flags compiled by FinCEN, indicators that can be used to identify fraudulent activity include unsolicited emails with attachments, text messages with embedded links, unusual URLs linked in emails and attached email images that seem to be digitally altered.  The warning added the shift to remote work has increased the vulnerability of firms to such attacks, and that cybercriminals have been targeting weak log-in processes by using digitally altered identity documents to gain access to sensitive information online.

The bill, approved by the country's parliament last week, says companies can issue digital securities on a blockchain if they are properly registered with the Bank of Russia as issuers and satisfy certain criteria.  Decentralized cryptocurrencies are considered a type of property, which should be reported for tax purposes and cannot be used to pay for goods and services.  A more detailed law regulating crypto-related businesses is expected to be passed later this year, although no timeline has been disclosed.  The previous version of that bill, which has been introduced to the Russian parliament, would make it illegal to issue and trade crypto on Russia-based infrastructure.  The draft generally reflected the skeptical stance of the country's central bank.  It provoked an outcry from the crypto community and criticism from both Russia's Ministry of Justice and Ministry of Economic Development.

42384277,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAERsh,1596199803,"Ethereum 2.0: Closer Than Ever, Still Plenty of Work to Do","“Though now evolved in many ways,” Gavin Wood wrote in Ethereum’s 2015 yellow paper, “the key functionality of a blockchain with a Turing-complete language and an effectively unlimited inter-transaction storage capability remains unchanged.”      Five years and thousands of bits later, Ethereum is still chugging along as a decentralized platform for self-executing code.      And it has “evolved in many ways,” with the largest yet to come: Ethereum 2.0.      Call it Slasher or Casper, Shasper or Serenity, Eth 2.0 has had as nearly many names as unrealized goals. For all the hubbub, a physical implementation is knocking on the cryptocurrency gates and is set to debut (by most estimates) this fall.    Proof-of-Stake    Eth 1.x (the current blockchain) and Eth 2.0 will have some similarities, namely blocks attached in chains. But as CoinDesk’s Michael Casey pointed out recently, much rests on the technical ideas Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and others like Wood or Vlad Zamfir staked their reputations to in the project’s early days.      Read more: Ethereum’s Renaissance Creates an Opportunity – And a Major Test      The most important idea being the transition to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm from Proof-of-Work (PoW). Indeed, a future swap of the Ethereum blockchain’s consensus algorithm has been a core part of the network’s thesis from its early days.      In short, PoS verifies a transaction getting from point A to point B by having coin depositors agree to validate the transfer in return for a small reward. If the depositor interferes with the transfer and commits fraud, then their funds can be seized by the network.    🌈 Congrats! If you're reading this, you found the Easter egg in our series. Click here to see it.    The algorithm pulls from older Bitcoin-based projects as well as Buterin’s “weak subjectivity” model to create a more elastic consensus model with reasonable boundaries for transaction success.      Yes, PoS systems should theoretically send more coins more quickly than Bitcoin’s PoW. Other projects such as Tron, EOS and Tezos use variations of PoS, too. How to implement PoS without fraud is what the Eth 2.0 project has mainly been about.    The playing field    Not switching over to PoS has consequences, however.      Eth 1.x has seen outsized pressure from users demanding to use its blockspace over the past four months in what is turning into a constant friction for applications. Ethereum “killers” such as the NEAR Protocol are banking on a future where applications migrate to other blockchains in order to escape Ethereum’s fee pressure. Other technical upgrades such as optimistic rollups or EIP 1559 don’t present the optimal solution, but only complement the decentralized tech stack Buterin and others envision.      Today, nine teams are coding Eth 2.0 in various programming languages in what are called clients. Most teams expect the project to rollout by October to November. (In fact, you can bet on when the network will deploy in this Omen prediction market.)      Eth 2.0 will be deployed in multiple steps, beginning with the Beacon chain. This chain will act as the orchestrator of the new PoS network, which will be separated into multiple blockchains called “shards.” Just last week, a new and “final” testnet was announced to precede the multi-client release of Eth 2.0’s first part, called phase 0.      Read more: Ethereum 2.0 Developers Announce ‘Final’ Testnet Before Network Launch      “Maintaining the set of validators and progressing the beacon chain and reaching finality come with phase 0,” Prysmatic Labs founder Preston Van Loon told CoinDesk. “The hardest part of [Eth 2.0] is getting this backbone together. ... Everything revolves around the beacon chain and then we can add other layers on top of it.”      All that to say, Eth 2.0 is quite close, but for real this time.    Eth 1.x    The network’s long-awaited launch also allows for reflection on the road to Serenity. Ideas only alluded to by Buterin in the project’s white paper have come to fruition with market value (though many still lack maturity).      “The first category is financial applications, providing users with more powerful ways of managing and entering into contracts using their money. This includes sub-currencies, financial derivatives, hedging contracts, savings wallets, wills, and ultimately even some classes of full-scale employment contracts,” Buterin wrote in 2013.      Take for example the charcuterie board of lending and trading applications known as decentralized finance (DeFi) with nearly $4 billion in crypto assets locked in various protocols, according to DeFi Pulse.      Read more: One Billion, Two Billion, Three Billion, Four? DeFi’s Knocking on TradFi’s Door      Quantstamp CEO Richard Ma told CoinDesk in a phone interview that the ecosystem around Ethereum has grown horizontally as much as it has aspired to new heights with Eth 2.0. He pointed to the Solidity programming language and tooling set around it as one poignant example.      Kosala Hemachandra, CEO and co-founder of MyEtherWallet, told CoinDesk that Etheruem has mainly grown in stages. Hemachandra said the beginning years were all about “documentation” with the current story being DeFi.      Hemachandra said Ethereum has matured over the years, regardless of Etheruem’s central story rapidly blinking from decentralized organizations (DAOs) to stablecoins to DeFi. The next Ethereum needs to be even more robust than the current blockchain if it is to build a new financial backbone as intended.

42384268,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAERg7,1596199567,CoinDesk Live Recap: Co-Founders Revisit Ethereum's Launch Drama,"Several Ethereum co-founders view the project as a wild success and some are even more bullish now than they were back in 2015, when the cryptocurrency project first launched.      “We brought in an HR person to start building up the team, I brought in my lawyer to be the first lawyer on the project. It was a risk,” said Ethereum co-founder Anthony Di Iorio, one of the first people to see Vitalik Buterin’s original Ethereum white paper.      Back in 2014, no one knew what to expect from a token sale that promised to kick-start a whole new type of cryptocurrency, something that would become more than digital money. In the early days, before fundraising with tokens became normalized, the experiment seemed unlikely to pay off. It was a long shot at best. But early investor Ken Seiff of Blockchange Ventures said that for him it was all about the founding team.      Seiff and Di Iorio were joined by The Defiant newsletter founder Camila Russo, fellow Ethereum co-founder Anthony D’Onofrio and CoinDesk podcast producer Adam Levine to talk about the early days of “the world computer.”      Di Iorio infamously was one of the dozen or so original contributors who wanted to create Ethereum as a startup rather than an open-source project shepherded by a nonprofit. There were fierce debates in the early days. Levine, a longtime Ethereum fan, said he was kicked out of the group Skype channel for criticizing plans for a pre-mine, which eventually made a few Ethereum co-founders very rich.      “I was concerned about the legitimacy of the project and the ability of it to succeed,” Levine said. “Bitcoin never had the ‘Bitcoin team.’ … Bitcoin was never a startup.”      Now, looking back, Levine said Ethereum fans weren’t deterred by the token sale and he thinks the token-fueled nonprofit route appears to have been successful.      D’Onofrio added that other members of the founding team didn’t have entrepreneurial experience, but he avoided mentioning venture capital norms at the time because he was nervous about whether the token launch would work at all.      “I almost sold my ether before Ethereum launched,” D’Onofrio said. “I didn’t want to get trapped in a four-year vesting period.”      There were rumors of betrayal among many of the co-founders. By the time Seiff met Buterin and the others, these entrepreneurial bitcoiners had already developed a reputation.      Read more: Ethereum as Lifestyle Brand: What Unicorns and Rainbows Are Really About      “I had heard about [Gavin Wood] and Vitalik a week before I met them. … [Vitalik] clearly had fanboys and was a matinee idol,” Seiff said. “Ethereum was different than Bitcoin. … Ethereum was the internet and Bitcoin was email, because there was no [Web3] internet when bitcoin was built, [Bitcoin] had to build its own protocol.”      The language chosen in the early days was very deliberate, these long-time observers said, such as choosing to call projects decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) rather than corporations.      “I think we’ll never know how it might have happened if it went in a different direction,” Di Iorio said.    'Second life'    Everyone agreed Ethereum successfully decentralized, thanks to the founding team’s tireless outreach efforts, and became an emerging technology sector in its own right.      In particular, Seiff said that “Ethereum got a second life this year” with the decentralized finance (DeFi) boom. As of 2020, there are now billions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency locked in Ethereum-based financial products.      In fact, Di Iorio said he’s more bullish on Ethereum now than he’s ever been before.      This CoinDesk Live session was the fourth program in a five-day series of live-streamed conversations.

42384281,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAERwT,1596199392,First Mover: Chainlink's Soaring Token Shows Lucrative 'Oracle' Role in Fast-Growing DeFi,"Chainlink’s LINK tokens have quadrupled in price this year to become one of the biggest success stories this year in cryptocurrency markets.      The project’s market capitalization, now the 12th highest among all digital assets at $2.7 billion, according to CoinGecko, reflects investor perceptions of Chainlink as the leading crypto “oracle” provider. That means it supplies prices and data streams to semi-automated lending and trading systems built atop blockchains.      You’re reading First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      The function is crucial in the fast-growing arena of decentralized finance, or DeFi, which has generated such a speculative fervor in recent months that supposed money-of-the-future bitcoin has almost started to look passé.      But now Chainlink’s early lead as the dominant DeFi oracle is starting to attract competitors, and cryptocurrency investors are wondering if the niche industry might be due for a shakeup. Given the key role played by oracles in DeFi, users of the decentralized systems also stand to benefit.      Potential rivals could include dedicated oracle upstarts like Tellor as well as leading DeFi projects like MakerDAO that are developing their own solutions. Another data oracle, Band Protocol, launched a new version of its network on the Cosmos blockchain last month, to avoid congestion on the more popular Ethereum network, on which Chainlink runs. Others in the space include Augur and Nest, according to the industry-tracking website DeFi Pulse.      ""I think it's good that there are different projects that are offering this, obviously,"" Niklas Kunkel, head of backend services for MakerDAO, said in a phone interview.      Chainlink has taken a commanding lead among DeFi oracles, a perch that’s been strengthened with frequent announcements of new partnerships and node operators. Just last week, Deutsche Telekom's IT subsidiary, T-Systems, announced plans to join Chainlink as a node operator. This past Friday, Korean banks IBK Bank, Shinhan Bank, KEB Bank, NH Bank and CenterPrime announced they plan to provide oracle data for Chainlink.      The project even has galvanized a community around it, and its most ardent supporters are known as Chainlink Marines on social media.      DeFi applications are built using “smart contracts” – strings of computer programming that are embedded into blockchain networks and designed to automate specific functions like lending or cryptocurrency swaps, based on incoming data inputs. There’s no human middlemen as in the case of centralized banks and Wall Street trading firms to monitor pricing, so the smart contracts rely on distributed input sources, known as oracles.      Under Chainlink’s protocol, data is aggregated from third parties and then batched into oracle feeds that are streamed out to DeFi systems. Various information providers, mostly from the cryptocurrency ecosystem, provide the data as “node operators” and are rewarded with payments in LINK. Many of Chainlink’s oracles have over a dozen participants.      Chainlink’s most popular product is pricing for cryptocurrencies like bitcoin; the platform lists 36 trading pairs on its website.      “If you don't have data on-chain, you can't build a contract for a certain market,” Sergey Nazarov, co-founder of Chainlink, told First Mover in a phone interview. “We don't make contracts. We don't secure blocks. We don't secure transactions. We just feed data into various systems.”      But in the fast-moving DeFi industry, where anything resembling an establishment could be years or even decades in the making, few competitors are ready to concede.      MakerDAO, the decentralized-lending project behind the dollar-linked stablecoin dai, has provided its own distributed oracles since 2017 and now lists seven price feeds on its website.      DeFi projects including 0x, Gnosis and Kyber Network are using MakerDAO’s oracle feeds as well as contributing to them as third-party data sources, according to Kunkel. Node operators in MakerDAO oracles are chosen and paid in the project's cryptocurrency, dai.      “When we started building dai, there weren't any existing oracles that we could utilize,” Niklas Kunkel, head of backend services for MakerDAO, told First Mover in a phone interview.      A newer entrant is Tellor, which uses a complex algorithm, based on the SHA-256 hash function that’s used in bitcoin mining, to assure the integrity of its data.      “Miners compete for the right to submit the data,” Tellor CSO Michael Zemrose said in a Telegram chat.      The rewards for providing data are paid out in Tellor’s native token, TRB. Its price has nearly quadrupled this year, but off of a smaller base: The token’s market capitalization stands at just $16 million according to CoinGecko, a tiny fraction of LINK’s.      At this point, the DeFi oracle market is Chainlink’s to lose.    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    BTC: Price: $11,196 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $11,214 | 24-Hr Low: $10,847      Trend: Bitcoin has been struggling to maintain momentum since a quick rush of volatility and a price surge to multi-month highs above $11,300 on Monday.      Since then, the price action has been largely centered around $11,000, with both lower highs and higher lows setting up a contracting triangle on the hourly chart. Such a pattern atop a prior bullish run ($9,000 to $11,300) is known as a bull pennant.      Chart analysts consider a bull pennant as a continuation pattern – one that recharges the bulls’ engines for an extension of the preceding rally. As such, we may see a bullish breakout and a rally toward the resistance at $12,000. A move above the upper end of the pennant, currently at $11,317, is needed to confirm the breakout.      That said, the possibility of the breakout failing to accelerate the uptrend cannot be ruled out, as the 14-day relative strength index is reporting overbought conditions with an above-70 print. In addition, Thursday’s doji candle is signaling buyer exhaustion.      If prices drop below the pennant support, currently at $10,920, a deeper decline toward the former hurdle-turned-support at $10,500 (February 2018 high) may be seen.

42384276,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAERrR,1596195796,Bitcoin on Track for Highest July Price Gain in 8 Years,"Bitcoin looks set to register its best July price performance for eight years and confirm a major bullish breakout in the process.    Bitcoin is trading near $11,190 at press time and is up nearly 22% this month, according to data from CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price index.  The cryptocurrency now needs to hold above $11,145 until Friday's close (in UTC time) to confirm the biggest July gain (at 22%) since 2012, when prices rallied by 40%.  If bitcoin closes below $11,050, the resulting monthly gain would be less than the 21% rise seen in July 2018.  July's double-digit monthly gain marks an end of a two-month-long price consolidation in the range of $9,000-$10,000.  The cryptocurrency sprang into action amid the U.S. dollar’s broad-based sell-off on the foreign exchange market and gold’s rally to record highs above $1,950 per ounce.  “Bitcoin stands out this year against a backdrop of massive stimulus measures from central banks and a failing financial system,” Paolo Ardoino, CTO of cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, told CoinDesk.  A resurgence of institutional participation and bearish sentiment around the dollar may power stronger gains over the coming months.  The bullish trend looks strong with the cryptocurrency showing few signs of stress, despite increased miner sales observed earlier this week.  Poolin, the biggest mining pool globally, transferred 435 bitcoin to exchanges on Wednesday, the biggest single-day outflow since May 3, according to Glassnode.  Technical charts also paint a bullish picture.  The monthly chart shows an upside break of a 2.5-year-long descending triangle.  The breakout has exposed resistance located at $13,880 (June 2019 high).  “Bitcoin’s break above $10,500 marks a significant change in the direction of the market,” popular analyst Lark Davis tweeted on Wednesday.  That possibility of a minor drop can't be ruled out, as bitcoin is looking overbought on the relative strength index.

The document (see in full below), filed at the Northern California District Court, comes in response to accusations Ripple failed to register XRP as a security with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and used deceitful tactics to defraud investors leading to false inflation in XRP's price.  Ripple's legal team said lead plaintiff Bradley Sostack's allegations relating to Ripple’s purported misrepresentations about XRP were based on ""unsupported leaps of logic.""  Sostack has not been able to explain why the alleged statements made by Garlinghouse are false, they claim.  Ripple's team also took aim at Sostack's ""artful pleading,"" saying he ""studiously avoids absolutes"" in his allegations.  The class-action lawsuit was originally filed against Ripple and Garlinghouse in May 2018.  As one example in the original complaint, plaintiffs allege Garlinghouse had stated on Dec. 14, 2017, he was “very, very long XRP as a percentage of my personal balance sheet.”  Around the same time, Garlinghouse is claimed to have sold 67 million XRP (worth around $16.4 million at press time). This is a misrepresentation, plaintiffs argue, coming at the time he said he was long on the cryptocurrency.  Ripple filed a motion to dismiss the suit in part in June, asking the court to dismiss all three counts of fraud without leave to amend.  A month later, Sostack filed an opposition to the motion, saying the suit had met the demands of U.S. fraud law having identified ""over a dozen false or misleading statements made by Ripple and its CEO.""

A spear-phishing attack is a targeted attempt to steal information such as account details or financial information from a particular individual, in this case, Twitter employees via their phones.  The success of the hack hinged on two key factors – that the hacker(s) gained access to Twitter's internal network and that they obtained the credentials from specific Twitter employees.  The credentials of the employees provided ""god mode"" access to Twitter's internal support tools, blockchain startup Make Sense Labs' CTO Ben Sigman previously told CoinDesk.  According to Twitter, not all employees that had been targets of the phishing attack had the necessary permissions to use account management tools.  The hackers instead gained access to Twitter's internal systems and discovered further information relating to the social media giant's processes allowing the hackers to target employees who did have that access to support management tools. The New York Times previously reported the hackers found additional credentials in the company's Slack server.  The hacker(s) targeted 130 Twitter accounts, tweeting bitcoin giveaway scams and accessing the DM inbox from 36 accounts including CoinDesk's.  Twitter said the attack relied on a ""significant and concerted effort"" to mislead particular employees and ""exploit human vulnerabilities"" in order to gain access to its platform.  Since the hack, Twitter said it has ""significantly"" limited access to its internal support management tools to ""ensure ongoing account security"" while it finalizes its investigation.  For the time being, features such as its ""Your Twitter Data"" and processes have been impacted by the limitation of its tools.  A detailed technical report on the hack is expected to be released at a later date as Twitter awaits ongoing law enforcement investigations and further work to safeguard its platform.

42375638,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw9Nx1,1596164405,Ethereum History in 5 Charts,"Five years ago this week, the first general-purpose blockchain went live on a mainnet. Ethereum paved the way for a whole new use case for blockchain technology untethered from Bitcoin’s original vision as electronic cash.  CoinDesk marked the milestone with a special series of stories, live-streamed conversations and even a pop-up newsletter. These charts first appeared in the newsletter, one for each day.  Here are five charts for understanding Ethereum's evolution.  Part 1: A Bloodless Secession  Not one year after the launch of Ethereum, a seminal event split the community in two.  So acute was the disagreement between these two subcommunities that the row resulted in the creation of a new cryptocurrency called “ethereum classic,” cloned from the original Ethereum codebase.  Ethereum classic was created July 20, 2016, after $60 million worth of ether (ETH), Ethereum’s native cryptocurrency, was stolen from users of a dapp known as The DAO. At the time, The DAO was the only dapp of its kind where users could pool funds and vote on which projects the money would be invested in. The DAO’s vision (before it was hacked and drained of a significant chunk of its finances) was to be an investor-guided venture capital fund.  After weeks of deliberation, Ethereum developers reached a consensus that they should turn back the clock – reverse The DAO hack transactions and restore users’ lost ETH. The changes could only be implemented through a network-wide upgrade, also called a hard fork. Those who opposed the change argued in favor of retaining the integrity of the original blockchain’s history of transactions and balances – hacked funds and all.  So, on July 20, 2016, when the upgrade to restore user funds was executed, the Ethereum blockchain split in two. The portion of the community that retained the original log of transactions and balances from The DAO hack and did not upgrade the software created a parallel network, Ethereum Classic.  Since the split, the Ethereum network has hard forked seven additional times, though none of these subsequent upgrades have reached the same level of controversy as “The DAO Fork” of 2016.  Part 2: Those Darned Cats  The first dapp on Ethereum to gain real user traction was a collectibles game known as CryptoKitties. Launched in November 2017, the “digital cats” became so popular they were covered by news outlets around the world including The Financial Post, BBC and The New York Times.  At the height of their popularity, tokenized cats were trading on Ethereum for upwards of $200,000. However, the influx of users and a high volume of transactions from this one viral dapp clogged the Ethereum blockchain to unprecedented levels. A backlog of 30,000 transactions had piled up by December 2017, meaning that users would have to wait days for their transfers of ETH to be confirmed.  The developers behind CryptoKitties hastened to help stem the tide of new users by increasing game fees. Shortly after CryptoKitties’ launch, Ethereum saw the highest total for daily transaction fees in its history, on Jan. 10, 2018. Over $4.5 million was collected in fees by Ethereum miners that day. The same month, CryptoKitties reached 250,000 registered users.  In many respects, the CryptoKitties craze was the rude awakening that reminded Ethereum developers of the platform’s technical limitations. How could Ethereum become the world computer when one viral dapp was enough to overwhelm it? If the developers wanted to be serious about onboarding not thousands but millions of dapp users, they would need to come up with a concrete plan to increase throughput.  Part 3: Testing the Limits  The need for Ethereum 2.0 and its expected benefits to network efficiency as well as scalability has only grown stronger since the CryptoKitties craze of 2017. The popularity of initial coin offerings (ICOs) – a way to crowdfund early stages of a cryptocurrency project – by dollar amount raised reached its peak in 2018. A total of $7.8 billion was raised for over 1,000 projects that year. According to ICObench, over 80% of all ICOs rely on the Ethereum blockchain to create their tokens and issue them to investors.  Trends like the ICO boom of 2018 are indicative of the ways blockchain technology can be leveraged in more ways than simply peer-to-peer electronic cash. Ethereum, as the world’s first general-purpose blockchain platform, has become the central hub where dapp developers congregate to build any and all types of use cases for blockchain, be it gaming- or finance-related.  As a result, despite the technical limitations of the platform, dapp developer activity on Ethereum continues to thrive. The latest trend dominating user traffic and transaction volume on Ethereum is decentralized finance (DeFi). The DeFi movement currently sweeping Ethereum is made up of dapps modeled after traditional financial players such as lending services, exchanges and derivatives markets. As of July 29, 2020, $3.68 billion worth of crypto assets are locked by users into various DeFi protocols.  Part 4: Dapp Dominance  Ethereum’s vision since its inception has always been to be “the world computer” on top of which decentralized applications (dapps) and assets of any kind can be freely created and deployed.  To this end, Ethereum developers pioneered new technology in the emerging space of blockchain called “smart contracts.” A new programming language called Solidity was invented to help code dapps on Ethereum. In order to ensure interoperability between different dapps on the network, common frameworks were developed – like the ERC-20 and ERC-721 token standards.  These innovations have blazed the trail for other general-purpose blockchain platforms to emerge since Ethereum’s birth in 2015. EOS, Stellar, Tezos and Tron are four cryptocurrencies in the top 15 by market share that also feature dapp creation and deployment. Despite the growth in the number of alternative dapp platforms, Ethereum remains the most popular general-purpose blockchain both in terms of number of users and dapps, as shown in the chart above.  Ethereum hasn’t fulfilled its vision yet, however. Developers are convinced that the current blockchain infrastructure is wholly inadequate to handle an influx of millions, if not billions of users around the world. This was always the suspicion of the early founders of Ethereum, including Vitalik Buterin. Five years after releasing their creation into the wild, Buterin and others have worked out a roadmap called “Eth 2.0” to bring Ethereum’s development to completion. Eth 2.0’s first step is expected to launch sometime this year or early next.  Part 5: The Long Road to 2.0  Ethereum hasn’t fulfilled its vision yet.  Developers are convinced that the current blockchain infrastructure is wholly inadequate to handle an influx of millions, if not, billions of users around the world. This was always the suspicion of the early founders of Ethereum such as Vitalik Buterin. Five years after releasing their creation into the wild, Buterin and others have worked out a roadmap called “Ethereum 2.0” to bring Ethereum’s development to completion and it is anticipated to launch sometime this year or early next.  The Ethereum 2.0 roadmap is almost as ambitious as the original one which brought the first dapps into existence. While the launch of this technology is forthcoming, an important part of understanding Ethereum’s five-year history lies in studying the many iterations that Ethereum 2.0 underwent in its years of planning.  Originally, Ethereum 2.0 in 2015 was thought of as the final development phase for the project and dubbed “Serenity.” Serenity was tentatively expected to be rolled out 16 months after initial mainnet launch (which would have been November 2016). The upgrade would transition Ethereum from its reliance on a computationally intensive process for block production inherited from Bitcoin, known as “mining,” to a more energy-efficient process of validating.  To this end, developers created what is called the “difficulty bomb” to slowly but surely encourage this transition away from mining. The bomb, which was activated on March 14, 2016, increases the difficulty levels for miners to find an Ethereum block over time. This schedule at which this bomb slows block production has been delayed three times over the course of the last five years as developers re-worked plans for launching Ethereum 2.0.  The most recent delay to the difficulty bomb occurred on Jan. 2, 2020. This may be the last time the difficulty bomb is pushed back as tentative estimations by some developers suggest the transition to Ethereum 2.0 could begin officially sometime this year and replace the existing network by late next year.  While there is no telling what new technologies and standards of blockchain practice will be innovated as a result of Ethereum 2.0, looking back at the first five years of the network’s development does give some indication. In that time, Ethereum has undergone network-splitting upgrades, faced crippling technology bottlenecks, advanced new forms of fundraising for crypto projects and formalized a launch plan for migrating to Ethereum 2.0.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETC | TECHNOLOGY | TOKEN SALE | FORKS,"Christine Kim, Shuai Hao",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/07/31/ethereum-history-in-5-charts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7c15db9df12ab08e0030ef90be7315bf34fd669b-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
