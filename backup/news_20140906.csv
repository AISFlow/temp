42426028,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhvFh,1410020408,"The Hottest Sectors in Bitcoin, Ranked by Venture Capital Flow","One of the most exciting things about a novel technology like bitcoin is watching its infrastructure be built right before our eyes.  The need for infrastructure creates boundless opportunities for innovators and entrepreneurs to focus their efforts on developing products that solve problems in many different sectors of the industry.  But which sectors in the bitcoin ecosystem are commanding the most attention?  To explore this, we analyzed CoinDesk’s venture capital investment data, which groups companies in the bitcoin industry into six broad sectors: exchanges, wallets, payment processors, financial services, mining, and ‘universal’, which includes companies working across multiple sectors.  Venture capital flow into the bitcoin space has been a key driver of the industry’s growth over the past two years. In addition to the obvious monetary benefits, multimillion-dollar investments from revered investors like Marc Andreessen and Tim Draper help bring legitimacy to the often misunderstood technology.  As such, VC investment data serves as a helpful tool to gauge which areas in the ecosystem are being built on the most – or in other words, which sectors in bitcoin are the ‘hottest’.  The data  To be considered for this analysis, a company must have raised a minimum of $250,000 from a venture capital firm, angel investor or a combination of the two. These criteria were chosen because a number of companies in our database are enrolled in accelerators like Boost VC and, while important to the industry, are still in beta.  The result was 46 different companies that, as of 1st September, have raised a total of $264m since our first recorded investment in mid-2012.  While the six sectors we classified aren't always mutually exclusive – nor do they encompass every area in the industry – they're representative of the different types of services in which businesses are specializing.  The data show that exchanges and financial services companies account for 56% of all companies with VC funding.  Popular names like Bitstamp and OKCoin (exchanges) and Chain (financial services) have raised substantial investment rounds, but when we look at how much money is going into each sector instead of just the number of companies in each sector, we see more diversity.  The hottest sectors in bitcoin  1. Universal companies  Total VC investments: $62.7m | Number of companies: 6  Coinbase  and Circle dominate the universal company sector, which has seen more venture capital invested than any other area. Other universal companies like Korbit and Coinplug offer a wide range of services to customers, often acting as an exchange, wallet and payment processor all at once.  2. Financial services  Total VC investments: $43.4m | Number of companies: 12  BitGo  , Chain and Ripple Labs lead the pack here, with younger companies like Vaurum and TradeBlock also posting multimillion dollar investments from investors. Companies in the financial services sector offer a variety of services, with some focused on block chain infrastructure and others on technical analysis of bitcoin's price.  3. Exchanges  Total VC investments: $43.1m | Number of companies: 14  Exchanges are the most populated sector in bitcoin, with 14 companies that have all raised $250,000 or more from investors. Despite the abundance of players in the field, VC investment in exchanges has been disproportionately low, with the average funding per company sitting at $3.1m.  4. Wallets  Total VC investments: $43.1m | Number of companies: 4  There are fewer companies in the wallet sector than any other, probably because most of the universal companies have wallets built into their business models too. As for companies keeping their focus primarily on wallets, Xapo reigns king with $40m raised so far – more than any other business in the industry.  5. Payment processors  Total VC investments: $37.7m | Number of companies: 5  BitPay  has raised most of the VC money that has gone to the payment processor sector. The company's recent $30m Series A funding round was the single largest investment into the bitcoin space, and included support from notable investors like Index Ventures and Virgin Group founder Richard Branson.  6. Mining  Total VC investments: $34m | Number of companies: 5  Arguably the bread and butter of the industry, it's a bit ironic that the mining sector hasn't received more support from venture capitalists. It's worth noting that this data was compiled before KnCMiner announced its $14m Series A funding round on 4th September.  The investment, led by Swedish VC firm Creandum, certainly helps balance out the amount of money each sector has received in the ever-growing bitcoin industry.

42426016,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhuth,1409997617,Why a Faster Bitcoin Network Would Keep Fees Low,"Transaction fees on the bitcoin network are often forgotten about. Yet in bitcoin they are more important than on other payment networks.  Fees currently serve as protection against the network being flooded with arbitrary transactions. Eventually, they will also be required to incentivise bitcoin miners to continue providing security to the network.  Contrary to other payment networks, the fees will not be set centrally, but will be determined by a market between users and miners.  The lower bound of transaction fees will be determined by the marginal cost incurred by miners for including transactions. This, in turn, is determined by the speed at which information is spread around the network.  The cost of delays  Bitcoin, the protocol, is a set of rules for the construction, distribution and agreement of financial transactions. The excitement surrounding its invention stems from its ability to achieve consensus among anonymous participants on the order in which transactions were issued on the network. This permits the construction of an inclusive financial system that is free from discrepancies between market participants.  However, the network is only guaranteed to come to consensus over a period of time and, in fact, the bitcoin network is in a constant state of flux, where nodes differ in their record of the history of all transactions. Subsets of nodes that agree on a common set of transactions are known as partitions.  An event, such as the discovery of a new block in the block chain creates a partition in the network. When a miner finds a new block, it is the only node in the network that thinks that the length of the block chain has increased. The rest of the network will find out about the block consequently, with the delay largely dependent on the number of transactions included.  Each extra transaction included in the block adds to the time that it takes for blocks to reach every node in the network. Miners that are slow to hear about new-found blocks spend time working on redundant problems, which hurts their margins. Furthermore, this delay increases the possibilities for malicious attackers to double spend funds on the network.  How long is a chain?  Bitcoin miners are mainly incentivised by the 25 BTC block reward and fees play an insignificant role.  Delays in blocks spreading throughout the network mean that some miners are working on a shorter block chain than the longest chain in existence.  The bitcoin protocol ensures that all miners follow the longest chain to ensure consensus and hence a miner working on a shorter chain is likely to be wasting their efforts.  For blocks with over 1,000 transactions, it can take several minutes to reach the last node on the network. During this time the miners that are uninformed about the block in circulation will be creating a conflicting block.  Only one of these blocks can actually be included in the true record of bitcoin. Any extra data contained within the block slows the rate at which it spreads through the network, hence increasing the chances that it gets discarded along with the miner’s block reward.  This increase in the probability that the block gets discarded is the marginal cost faced by miners of including an additional transaction.  The need for speed  In my research, I found that small miners face a higher marginal cost than the minimum transaction fee 0.0001 BTC (5 cents at the time of publication). Acting rationally, they should not include any transactions in their blocks. In order to incentivise them to include transactions, fees would have to roughly quadruple to 0.0004 BTC (20 cents).  As there is a need to include more transactions, it is important to find more efficient protocols for spreading information around the bitcoin network or risk having much higher fees on transactions.  Reducing the time that it takes for information about new blocks to spread through the network would reduce time spent on redundant blocks and hence also reduce the probability that any blocks found are discarded.  However, while some engineering solutions are currently being discussed, further research around economic incentives and security risks is needed before any of these measures can be implemented.
