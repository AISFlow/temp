Prosecutors alleged Weigand, 56, worked to shore up Silk Road's vulnerabilities during its heyday and provided tech advice to site leadership. He also removed evidence from a London flat in 2013, prosecutors claimed.  But with the infamous bazaar for illicit drugs and illegal services defunct for nearly seven years, prosecutors in the hard-charging Southern District of New York chose to hit Weigand for the cover-up instead of the crime.  Weigand admitted he lied to agents of the Internal Revenue Service and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in January 2019 about his role on Silk Road, his pseudonym, his use of bitcoin on the site and his interactions with convicted Silk Road operator Ross Ulbricht's online identity, Dread Pirate Roberts.  The charge comes with a maximum statutory five-year prison term. Sentencing is scheduled for mid-December. No matter the outcome, it will fall well short of Ulbricht's life sentence.

42384714,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlCvP,1600719406,The Fast-Growing NFT Market Is Problematic Yet Promising,"In some circumstances, is yield farming with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) another term for wash trading?      Yield farming is the process of getting tokens in return for providing crypto assets to fledgling marketplaces. The activity surged this summer starting with decentralized finance (DeFi) money markets like Compound. But now the game has migrated to other markets as well. Just like players at arcades, yield farmers put in money and get tokens in return. Then they use those tokens to play video games, hoping to win a prize by beating the game.      In the NFT space, this dynamic is being pioneered by Rarible, where users are rewarded with rari tokens for buying and selling digital collectibles. Rari token rewards propelled the site to quickly overtake other NFT marketplaces. However, this dynamic also created a fresh set of problems related to wash trading. Traders often swap these reward tokens for money on platforms like Uniswap.      With more than 33,189 transactions tallying roughly $3.6 million in trading over the past month, according to NonFungible.com, there’s such a small market for crypto collectibles that wash trading can sometimes be difficult to identify.      Michael Arnold, an engineer at crypto gaming startup My Crypto Heroes, said it’s important to distinguish between the different types of NFT wash trading. In short, wash trading traditionally means someone putting “buy” and “sell” orders at the same time, to create the illusion of demand. Sometimes people can wash trade while yield farming, but these aren’t usually the same thing.      “Some developers have been spotted that did wash trading at the start. But I’d say it's rare. Some users also did wash trading, which might be more common,” Arnold said. “But it really depends on the incentives. If you’re a whale in a game, you want to do wash trading to see your game high in the OpenSea ranks. If you’re trading on Rarible, you want to collect the governance tokens.”      Read more: Yield Farming Expands From Finance to Digital Collectibles      Coinfund co-founder Jake Brukhman, an investor in Rarible, said the reason rari token rewards are closer to yield farming than traditional rewards programs is that rari gives users voting rights.      “This is a story about a marketplace that came in with a bunch of incumbents and introduced a crypto-native monetization, through a token,” Brukhman said. “When you get rari you become a partial owner of the platform. This gives you a right to vote in the governance process.”      The governance token has functioned as a growth driver, long before voting options were viable, with Messari Research showing sales on Rarible surging to well over $6 million by Sept. 16.      “Who these protocols are democratizing for is individuals and retail users. It’s easier for my brother to 10x his NFT investment on Rarible than it is for me as Coinfund,” Brukhman added.      Out of 25 million rari tokens created, roughly 30% are reserved for the Rarible’s team, while the plan is to distribute 60% to various user groups.      “Some people are incentivized to create volume,” Rarible co-founder Alexander Salnikov said.      As the primary holders, Rarible wants to make sure the governance tokens retain value beyond yield farming, a daunting aspiration. Salnikov said he estimated more than 40% of the $750,000 worth of NFT trades on his platform in August involved some type of wash trading. Salnikov said the platform is adding transaction fees to help curtail this issue.    Incentive models    Stimulating demand to collect reward points, like rari tokens, is just one form of NFT wash trading. Another form of performative trading could be compared to bombastic marketing, or chasing clout for visibility.      For example, a whale can simply ask a friend to buy his collectible while a token accumulator requires many accounts and transactions. Some marketplace users are still just experimenting with “mutually beneficial” deals between friends.      Read more: What Is Yield Farming? The Rocket Fuel of DeFi, Explained    Furthermore, platforms like Nifty Gateway that rank secondary marketplace sales might incentivize hops across platforms. There are also rare NFT galleries, like the Museum of Crypto Art, which purchased the Picasso Bitcoin Bullhttps://www.trevorjonesart.com/11---picassos-bull.html NFT for $55,555 via Nifty Gateway, according to the artist Trevor Jones.    For now, most of the value appears to come from the ability to transact with a geographically diverse community of crypto fans, including a few thousand artists and gamers. As with any crypto exchange, the platforms need to incentivize constructive user behavior rather than quick pump-and-dumps.      It’s rare for authentic buyers to trade an asset many times within 24 hours, so this is one of the signs used to identify suspicious patterns.      “We rely heavily on community signaling to identify those guys,” Rarible’s Salnikov said, adding they are denied token rewards.    Governance challenges    From Brukhman’s perspective, if the platform can overcome these technical barriers to governance the profits could be extraordinary.      “They have a bunch of challenges that are technical, but what’s most important for me as an investor is they’ve positioned themselves as a platform for all the different NFT types,” Brukhman said. “It’s also domain names, insurance, photography, 3D models, they’re going to become a Reddit for NFTs … that’s a much bigger market than art.”      Beyond liquidations on Uniswap, the rari token is primarily used to vote on governance options for the exchange. The Rarible platform does have an active community of digital artists, the Telegram group has 2,345 members and Discord has hundreds as well, where authentic trades and projects are discussed between fans.      One such authentic fan, an artist who goes by Yeli, earns her primary income from selling artistic NFTs since her restaurant job shuttered in March.      “The transition itself was pretty sharp, in the sense of going from a full-time job and making art every once in a while, to having all the time to create and brainstorm and collaborate with other artists,” Yeli said. “Luckily, though, I can say I’ve been blessed enough to have a small but steady stream of collectors lately who enjoy what I make enough to buy it and hopefully more people can take a look at it and feel the same way.”      Read more: The NFT Game That Makes Cents for Filipinos During COVID      There are around 1,449 rari token holders, most of which weren’t blacklisted as part of identifying the problematic 40% of transactions. There does appear to be a consistent group of people who buy and sell NFTs.      Plus, it’s unclear how accurate that wash trading estimate is. Some now-excluded Rarible users claim they weren’t involved with wash trading and the platform didn’t offer them any opportunity for explanation or recourse.      “Some interesting projects related to NFTs were commissioned by a community member in the style of Japanese Waifus and community members were excited about it,” one such buyer who traded a flagged NFT, AaronTing8, said in a direct message. “Pretty much everyone I talk to who has bought the Yumiko NFT did not get the Rari airdrop. In fact, many did not receive Rari airdrops for other trading activities.”      The startup rectified this issue by issuing a special NFT, which jilted buyers could use to claim belated rewards from the previous Yumiko NFT purchases. Going forward, the startup aims to solve this issue with more direct community involvement, rather than routinely arbitrating themselves.      “We have a plan to transition to a fully decentralized system,” Salnikov said in a phone interview, adding there will be a way for token holders to delegate their voting power to other parties. “There will be a DAO [decentralized autonomous organization] controlling all of this.”      Read more: Dapper Labs–USDC Integration Helps NBA Collectibles Game Clear $2M in Revenue Since June      At this stage, there’s no way to divorce speculation from future governance. Even artists like Yeli, who sell NFTs more often than she trades, find a curious appeal in the speculative aspects of the Rarible ecosystem.      “The main attractive use of these cryptocurrencies lies in the ability to transact quickly and efficiently,” Yeli said, adding she uses bitcoin for savings and tokens for the operational needs of her NFT business. “But, also, I can’t say the speculative aspect isn’t a main draw. It’s fascinating to imagine earning a living in crypto, when the value can literally go anywhere.”      As for Arnold of My Crypto Heroes, he prefers to focus on collectibles that work as video game assets, not stores of value. This process is simpler because it usually doesn’t involve yield farming. At least, not yet. However, Arnold said, collectibles could someday become a part of the professional gaming industry. That might involve more complex token models.      “You can compare it to cars: Unless it’s a very rare, old, valuable car, it’s meant to drive and will lose value over time,” Arnold said. “Once the infrastructure of lending and staking is in place, I can totally see NFT whales renting their NFTs to players for a revenue share on the rewards.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/09/21/the-fast-growing-nft-market-is-problematic-yet-promising,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7c1e0b49ca87dfb3ccac8ddbd7150a15c420ddb0-1600x900.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384726,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlDAV,1600718523,"SEC, OCC Issue First Regulatory Clarifications for Stablecoins","The U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has published fresh guidance, officially clarifying national banks can provide services to stablecoin issuers in the U.S.      The OCC and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) published stablecoin guidance Monday, providing the first detailed national guidance on how cryptocurrencies backed by fiat currencies should be treated under law. Prior to Monday's notices, there was no federal clarity around stablecoins.      Stablecoin issuers have been using U.S. banks for years, but in an unclear regulatory environment. Now, the OCC wants federally regulated banks to feel comfortable providing services to stablecoin issuers, it said in a press release. An accompanying interpretative letter, signed by Senior Deputy Comptroller Jonathan Gould, explained that while banks should conduct due diligence and ensure they assess the risks of banking any stablecoin issuers, stablecoins are becoming increasingly popular.      The letter specifies it refers to stablecoins backed on a one-to-one basis by fiat currencies.      “National banks and federal savings associations currently engage in stablecoin related activities involving billions of dollars each day. This opinion provides greater regulatory certainty for banks within the federal banking system to provide those client services in a safe and sound manner,” Acting Comptroller of the Currency Brian Brooks said in a statement.      Jeremy Allaire, CEO of CENTRE member Circle, told CoinDesk in March that at present, USDC issuers have to onboard with reserve banks, with each member holding an account at these banks.      “I can’t speak on behalf of other stablecoins but at CENTRE we’ve seen really robust demand from significant banking institutions to get involved in reserve banking stablecoin clients,” he said at the time.    Banking stablecoins    The OCC detailed how banks should handle stablecoin reserves, specifically referring to stablecoins backed by currencies like the dollar.      The OCC has taken a number of steps to integrate the crypto space with the existing financial system under Brooks, who is Coinbase’s former general counsel. In recent months, the OCC has told banks they can provide services to crypto startups and floated a national payment charter for exchanges and other fintech firms.      According to the letter, stablecoin issuers can point to the fact that regulated banks hold their reserves to convince the general public that they are safe.      The letter specifies that the OCC’s guidance only refers to stablecoins held in hosted wallets, meaning wallets controlled by a trusted third party. Unhosted wallets, which are controlled by the individual user who owns the cryptos being stored, are not included in Monday’s announcement.      Read more: Following OCC Letter, Some US Banks Appear Open to Providing Crypto Services      “The due diligence process should facilitate an understanding of the risks of cryptocurrency and include a review for compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including those related to the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and anti-money laundering,” the OCC’s interpretative letter said.      This due diligence includes Patriot Act compliance as well.      “Stablecoin reserve accounts could be structured as either deposits of the stablecoin issuer or as deposits of the individual stablecoin holder if the requirements for pass through insurance are met,” the letter explained.    SEC response    Further, the SEC said certain stablecoins might not be securities under federal law, but advised issuers to work with the agency and legal counsel to ensure this is the case. According to the statement, the SEC is willing to publish a ""no-action"" letter, which would assure the recipient that the regulator would not bring an enforcement action against the company.      “Whether a particular digital asset, including a so-called ""stablecoin,"" is a security under the federal securities laws is inherently a facts and circumstances determination. This determination requires a careful analysis of the nature of the instrument, including the rights it purports to convey, and how it is offered and sold,” the SEC said.      Monday’s statements would appear to apply to fiat-backed stablecoins only, not algorithmic ones. Basis, a stablecoin startup which raised $133 million in 2018, shut down that December after its lawyers concluded that the specific mechanism for its token would be treated as securities under U.S. law.      The SEC’s crypto czar, Valerie Sczcepanik, said as much during last year’s SXSW.      “You might be getting into the land of security” with algorithmic stablecoins, she said in March 2019.      The SEC said Monday that it recommended issuers contact FinHub, its fintech wing, to ensure projects remain in compliance.      ""The Staff stands ready to engage with market participants to assist them and to consider providing, if appropriate, a 'no-action' position regarding whether activities with respect to a specific digital asset may invoke the application of the federal securities laws,"" the SEC said.

42405083,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeKxBL,1600713321,"Here in Venezuela, Doctors Struggle to Access Aid From Crypto Platform","CARACAS, Venezuela — At first blush, it looked like cryptocurrency adoption was poised to make a huge stride in Venezuela.      Late last month, Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó announced he would use the digital currency exchange Airtm to redistribute some $19 million to Venezuelan health care workers. The money would come from funds that the U.S. government seized from the incumbent Maduro government. The “health heroes” funds would be delivered via Airtm’s stablecoin, AirUSD.      But after speaking to various medical personnel here, I came away with the impression that the health heroes campaign has been somewhat chaotic.      After the publication of this article, AirTM said it facilitated 48,000 payments, which should have distributed about $4.8 million. It was given $19 million to hand out to potential recipients.      One health care worker told me what happened when she tried to register:      “Most people I know, who work like me in the health sector and have discussed the matter, couldn’t register and didn’t even know what Airtm is. … The first registration page kept failing and it made you go back to the beginning. … I only know one person who was able to register but has not received the confirmation email.""      Venezuela has become a popular example of the power of crypto, which is sometimes more reliable than our hyperinflated national currency, the bolivar. But the Airtm campaign is another example of how well-intentioned crypto campaigns are easily obstructed by the daily challenges of Venezuelan life.    Quarantine    Bitcoin adoption is low nationwide, but during quarantine its use appears to have grown a little. Bitcoin peer-to-peer trade volume has held steady in 2020. [Note: Paxful recently left Venezuela, citing U.S. sanctions.]      Venezuela currently has more than 60,000cases of COVID-19 and the pandemic has only worsened Venezuela’s economic crisis. The vast majority of the population survives day to day and must decide between starvation or risking the virus to earn some money.      See also: Venezuelans Made Lightning-Savvy Hardware to Use Bitcoin During Blackouts      During quarantine, some people seemed to grow more interested in speculating in financial markets, including cryptocurrencies. That’s because Venezuela’s currency is so inflated that many consider it worthless. There are also many people with a desperate need to make money.      The bolivar remains volatile. The U.S. dollar is the more trusted currency, but some people think paper money can transmit COVID-19. There are a lot of digital payment options, but none are very popular. So accepting bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has become more attractive.    Health heroes    COVID-19 has brought to light another big cryptocurrency story. Venezuela currently has a parallel government led by the opposition leader Juan Guaidó, who has also been declared president by the national assembly. In April, Guaidó promised to give bonuses to the health care workers who have been helping to manage the COVID-19 pandemic. The bonus would be around $100 a month for three months of work, which is not a small amount in Venezuela.      The health heroes funding, which adds up to at least $19 million, would come from money seized from the Maduro government by the United States and held by the U.S. Treasury Department.      It’s worth noting that the Venezuelan state has a cryptocurrency of its own, the Petro. The AirUSD bonus will probably be much easier to use than the Petro bonus that the Venezuelan government gave out at the end of 2019. Up until today, there are still people who have not managed to move those Petros.      See also: The Battle to Get Dictator’s Seized Millions to 62,000 Venezuelan Health Heroes      According to Guaidó's team, this campaign has four stages: application; verification and selection; registration in the digital platform (Airtm) intended for payment; and transfer of aid for three consecutive months. The last stage has already begun.      The first stage was chaotic because the Maduro government quickly blocked the registration page. There were also phishing attempts intended to steal personal data. One public employee said he received threats from his supervisor for trying to receive the funds. Two of five health care workers I spoke to did not manage to pass the first stage because they could not open the page because of the government’s block.      According to Guaidó's team, more than 75,000 users were registered, and some 62,000 people were selected to receive the bonuses. It’s hard to know what percentage this is of total public health employees. Estimates range widely, and the only entity that would know the correct number is the Maduro government.    Airtm    Airtm, incorporated in Oregon in 2015, took off in 2017 after a pre-ICO for selected investors. The exchange manages a P2P market for its clients with its own stablecoin, AirUSD. The Airtm platform is supposed to transfer the funds to the workers. The personnel who have been selected have to register and verify their identity to access the stablecoins.      A spokesperson for the campaign said one reason this platform was chosen was because it met the requirements of being able to avoid national bank accounts, to pay out in dollars and to create accounts from an email address. Importantly, Airtm is also based outside of Venezuela and is thus safer from government retaliation.      Airtm’s P2P market has its own exchange rate. If users wish to transfer AirUSD to bolivars, they can do it within the Airtm platform but they still might have to deal with a Venezuelan bank account.      AirTM Co-Founder and Executive Chairman Tim Parsa told CoinDesk that it began requiring ""Tier 2 KYC"" (know-your-customer) information recently to try and ""prevent infiltration"" of its service by government employees. Local news organizations reported the move as AirTM cutting off new accounts from Banco de Venezuela, the nation's largest bank, citing an email apparently sent out to users.      See also: Ukraine Leads Global Crypto Adoption, Chainalysis Says in New Report      Venezuela’s banking regulator has ordered the monitoring of banking transactions related to Airtm, in addition to blocking access to the web by telecommunications companies. In 2018 the platform was blocked by Internet servers because the government did not like that it gave an exchange rate for the dollar. Then, they stopped blocking it until Aug. 20, when they censored it again.      Now, authorities are even blocking the pages of virtual privacy networks (VPN) that could be used to access Airtm. The Guaidó and Airtm team are publishing educational content on how to use VPNs and how to change the DNS of their computers and avoid the censorship of VPNs by using mobile applications to access the web. They are even creating advisory groups called digital godfathers to help workers access the platform.      Jéronimo Bernot, who heads growth and client support at Airtm, told me that Airtm will consider any project that is aligned to their mission of financial freedom and inclusion. Would Airtm ever follow Paxful in ceasing to work with Venezuela? “AirTm is staying,” Bernot replied.      According to recent statements by Guaidó, 70% of the selected health personnel are carrying out the identity verification process at Airtm. Also according to Guaidó, more than 39.000 health professionals have received their first bonus of $100.    Feedback    To get a better understanding of the campaign, I spoke to some workers from the public health sector. They all said they were unaware of Airtm until the media promotion of the “Health Heroes” campaign.      Airtm’s Bernot told me that in anticipation of the campaign, the exchange grew their team by 20%. But there have still been bottlenecks in identity verification, for example.      “The biggest problem is that most of the doctors who receive this bonus are not very close to the world of technology, and many doctors are older. If you add to this the fact that peer-to-peer exchanges are not the most common option, things get even more complicated,” Bernot said.      But a rural doctor from the city of San Antonio de Los Altos acknowledged the campaign’s merits. Doctors continue to perform their medical duties, in spite of receiving a $3 salary every two weeks. As of Sept. 13, more than 126 health care workers reportedly died while working to fight COVID-19.      See also: What Venezuelans Think About Bitcoin and American Media      “It’s not the solution, but it does address certain needs,” the doctor said of the campaign. “The lack of biosafety material puts us at greater risk … [O]ur work with patients does not allow us to deny them medical assistance, but the reality is that our safety also matters. ""      Another rural doctor from the same city said the campaign was a step in the right direction, given the risks health care workers face.      “Transportation has been affected and its availability reduced, leading to extreme and costly measures for health personnel who depend on these services. We have to acquire biosafety materials on our own[,] ... exponentially increasing the exposure and risk of contagion of the entire medical team.”      To the doctor, the campaign is both fair and necessary:    “Not just thinking about the economics of those who will benefit from this bonus, but as a form of valuation that distinguishes the hard work performed by each person who makes up a link in our country’s health care system.”    UPDATE (Sept. 22, 2020, 22:55 UTC): This article has been updated with additional comments and clarifications from AirTM Co-Founder and Executive Chairman Tim Parsa.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,José Rafael Peña Gholam,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/09/21/here-in-venezuela-doctors-struggle-to-access-aid-from-crypto-platform,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/110417370ba37af7dab00cc31a476256478597d0-2400x1600.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405070,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeKwzX,1600707681,"Chamath Palihapitiya’s Social Capital Holds Bitcoin From 2013, Mulls Public Listing","A Silicon Valley fund manager holds bitcoin purchased seven years ago as it mulls being publicly traded.      Palo Alto, Calif., investment firm Social Capital invested in bitcoin (BTC) in 2013, CEO Chamath Palihapitiya revealed Tuesday in an investment conference call. Bitcoin was trading between $13 and $1,200 in 2013 and today trades around $10,000, according to Coin Metrics data.      Palihapitiya made the disclosure on a Sept. 15 call about Social Capital’s plans to list Opendoor on the New York Stock Exchange through Social Capital Hedosophia II, one of six special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) registered with former DST Global partner Ian Osborne’s Hedosophia investment group to take companies they acquire public.      The first Social Capital Hedosophia SPAC merged with Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic, now valued at more than $4 billion on the public market, in an offering that raised $720 million. The Opendoor SPAC is raising about $1.1 billion in a deal valuing the company at $4.8 billion. The other four registered Social Capital Hedosophia SPACs are headlining valuations between $350 million and $1 billion.      With potentially dozens more of these blank-check companies in the works, Social Capital itself may go public to rival Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, Palihapitiya mused in a June Fortune interview. If that happens, Social Capital would be the first publicly traded venture capital and private equity fund manager with a significant market value to invest in cryptocurrency.    Bitcoin background    In 2018, an annual investor letter said at the time that Social Capital’s largest investments were bitcoin, Amazon and the San Francisco Golden State Warriors basketball team, in which Palihapitiya owns a minority stake. The three investments would be consolidated with the rest of Social Capital’s funds, the letter said. By then bitcoin had traded around its highest historical price, just under $20,000, in December 2017.      The exact amount of bitcoin Social Capital has bought and sold has not been publicly disclosed. Palihapitiya has talked about holding bitcoin before, but has not specified whether they were angel or fund investments. He told a bitcoin conference in 2011 that he held 100,000 bitcoin bought at less than $100 a pop, and he told TechCrunch in 2013 that he would purchase $10 million to $15 million in bitcoin in addition to the $5 million he already owned.      A senior vice president of Facebook from 2007 to 2011 when he founded Social Capital, Palihapitiya has fawned over bitcoin in interviews and media appearances, calling it “schmuck insurance” to “hedge against the traditional financial infrastructure.” Social Capital, with over $1.2 billion under management, has also invested in cryptocurrency trading platform SFOX, along with Box, Slack and SecondMarket, now the NASDAQ Private Market.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Ada Hui,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/09/21/chamath-palihapitiyas-social-capital-holds-bitcoin-from-2013-mulls-public-listing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b59cb7fdf99f08dec49b5fd5a13a138ae46766d2-1024x683.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405081,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeKx8O,1600706861,How Activist Investors Can Help the Digital Assets Industry Mature,"Following the 2008 financial crisis, both Main Street and Wall Street agreed that power was too concentrated at the financial institution level. People wanted more control, birthing the era of Bitcoin, and later, other forms of digital assets. The digital assets movement was based on putting power back in the hands of customers, users, and communities – to democratize decision making, governance and value accrual.      However, the 2017 initial coin offering boom turned into a money grab for easy financing without proper governance and oversight built into the tokens or their issuing companies. ICOs were often done quickly and without proper details, forcing investors to give project leaders the benefit of the doubt that as their project matured, it would self-govern.      This need for self-regulation was evident back in 2018, when early discussions around token governance were first formulated. The venture capitalist Mikal Khoso wrote:      “Part of the maturation of the ICO as a fundraising mechanism will be the establishment of frameworks for what rights token ownership should afford investors. Ideally the market will self-regulate and create these frameworks.”      Unfortunately, this has not happened. Token holders are left with little recourse on how to force companies and their management teams to follow through on their initial promises.    Jeff Dorman, a CoinDesk columnist, is chief investment officer at Arca where he leads the investment committee and is responsible for portfolio sizing and risk management. He has more than 17 years of trading and asset management experience at firms including Merrill Lynch and Citadel Securities.    This is less of a problem in traditional finance, where debt and equity markets have clearly defined stakeholder structures for investor recourse, resulting in governance systems that protect investor interests and prevent rogue executives from running amok with a company. That said, many investors incorrectly believe that owning debt or equity ensures that you have direct control over a company’s assets.      If a company has $100 million in cash on the balance sheet, the only claim you have on those assets is if the company files for bankruptcy. Otherwise, this cash only directly benefits debt and equity holders if there is governance in place to prevent management from making terrible decisions (i.e. an independent board of directors), or if you trust management to create a high return on this cash.      To date, digital assets investors have yet to be shielded by similar legal and market protections. So where do you find checks and balances in the digital assets industry when token issuance is not regulated and legal precedent has not yet been set for token holders’ rights?    Token holders have rights, even if not explicitly laid out in a white paper or a court of law.    Often management teams are aligned with their investors and this is not an issue. In cases where they are not, investors can force change. A recent Willis Towers Watson report suggested a primary role of investors is stewardship. ""Arguably, good stewardship is the most useful function the asset management industry performs,"" it said.      Activist investors are often portrayed negatively. They are viewed as self-interested, when in reality, their efforts are typically beneficial to all stakeholders. An “activist,” by definition, is merely an agent for change, and in many cases, it is only the activist investor who can see clearly and objectively enough to help a company recognize that change is needed. In fact, according to McKinsey, it is beneficial for companies to role-play and think like an activist investor, to help uncover their own internal blind spots.      ""Done well, an activist role-play approach is substantially more provocative than a standard strategy review. The tone can be aggressive, even confrontational. Adopting an activist perspective can help set a higher bar for operating improvements,"" McKinsey said.      The growth in ESG investing (environmental, social and governance) has shown that investor pressure can influence company decisions even without having any legal rights. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, released an open letter warning companies that it would “be increasingly disposed to vote against boards moving too slowly on sustainability.” In BlackRock’s words, social purpose “is the engine of long-term profitability.”      Essentially, companies are being held accountable simply by the threat of losing access to strong investor bases. They want management teams to protect more than just shareholders; they want them to protect all stakeholders, which includes employees, the environment, their city and their social surroundings.      See also: Jeff Dorman - Amazon Prime Membership Should Have Been a Tokenized Asset      Recently, Arca has played the role of an “activist investor” in the digital assets space by submitting a proposal to Gnosis after uncovering what we consider to be gross mismanagement of resources, a lack of internal controls and fiduciary responsibility, and an un-communicated roadmap that strays away from their original white paper. While we have yet to see any tangible benefits, our conversations with Gnosis have spurred them to announce that they will redo their tokenomics for the GNO token, including more collaboration and input with token holders and community members.      This is the ethos of digital assets. Token holders have rights, even if not explicitly laid out in a white paper or a court of law. Our right is to stand up to management teams and project leaders who are making misaligned, or outright negligent decisions, and to pressure them through the court of public opinion to do right by their token holders and communities.      By highlighting blind spots, mismanagement, or projects veering off course, we, token holders, can move this industry forward. This is something that Arca feels strongly about and is part of our core values. The digital assets ecosystem needs to adopt the best practices of traditional finance. A strong governance system is one element that will help keep companies in this space on track and will hold them accountable. The digital assets industry should welcome this movement, since the genesis of digital assets was to give more control back to the community.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Jeff Dorman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/09/21/how-activist-investors-can-help-the-digital-assets-industry-mature,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/36c878d0d3849f184b8a806573a40b82d925237b-1420x947.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This Firm Is Helping Businesses Save in Bitcoin,"The COVID-19 pandemic and its accompanying monetary policy have caused a surge in demand for bitcoin, and now companies are eying “digital gold” to protect their treasuries from cash depreciation.      Announced Monday, bitcoin financial services firm Unchained Capital has released an “advanced business account” specifically targeting firms that not only want to hold bitcoin but want to handle their own private keys rather than rely on some third-party crypto custodian (in keeping with the ethos of “not your keys, not your bitcoin”).      The impetus to launch this service is straightforward and simple: It is no longer just folks in the crypto sphere who are worried about the printing of money, negative interest rates and the like. Just look at MicroStrategy’s recent moves.      Michael Saylor, founder of the business intelligence company, described bitcoin as “superior to cash” and announced that his publicly traded firm had purchased an additional $175 million of it last week, upping MicroStrategy’s total BTC holdings to around $425 million.      Read more: Bitcoin CEO: MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor Explains His $425M Bet on BTC      MicroStrategy is blazing a trail that many others are now in line to follow, explained Parker Lewis, head of business development at Unchained Capital.      As well as crypto-native businesses, family offices and investment firms, there is also an emergent crop of interested businesses that are not Bitcoin-centric, Lewis said.      “We have companies that you wouldn’t expect, like your local bakery or your local liquor store that hold bitcoin in treasury,” Lewis told CoinDesk. “They are not Bitcoin-centric businesses, but they hold bitcoin and they hold their own keys; both small and large, like the MicroStrategies of this world.”      As for Saylor, he told CoinDesk the numbers tell the tale.      “This year, the real yield on treasury assets dived to something like -20%. We can expect these assets to yield -10% or less for the years to come,” he said via Twitter DMs. “Corporate treasurers need to keep a reasonably liquid, elastic asset on the balance sheet to ensure the company can meet its obligations to employees, customers, vendors, creditors, etc. Bitcoin is the only asset that meets those requirements that also has a positive real yield.”    Bitcoin B2B    In times past it would have been hard to imagine the CEO or chief financial officer of a company wanting to mess around with private keys.      “We make it really simple,” said Phil Geiger, Unchained’s head of marketing. “We hold one key, our clients hold two keys, which means that our clients are really in full control over their bitcoin. With these new business accounts, we have built out a combination of enterprise-level controls for different user types, accounting and so on. But at the base of everything, it’s the Bitcoin protocol.”      Read more: Pandemic Will Speed Bitcoin Adoption, Says DBS Bank Economist      This is all fine and dandy, but regulated financial firms see a gray area at best when it comes to crypto custody, and are likely to lean towards the closest thing to the traditional world, a regulated custodian such as BitGo Trust.      “At first blush, that’s entirely logical,” said Lewis. “But I think there will be this push and pull in terms of the way things were, and how they are shifting over to the way things will be. We have this new form of money; do we need to forfeit it to legacy regulation that has existed for 30 or 40 years? Maybe the reality is that the regulations need to change to deliver the best security.”      So if a CFO needs to quickly get their hands on fiat how does that typically work?      “I think this can be tailored to the size of the organization,” said Lewis. “We have relationships with five or six OTC desks as well as being able to trade on exchange.”      Aleksandar Svetski, co-founder of bitcoin savings app Amber, has held 50% of the firm’s treasury in bitcoin for the past year. He pointed to abject conditions around cash and interest rates as a compelling incentive.      “Look at things like negative interest rates,” said Svetski. “What the fuck kind of ‘Twilight Zone’ world do we live in where you now have to pay a bank to hold your money? Of course people are looking for a non-cash alternative. Anyone who isn’t thinking about holding bitcoin now is crazy.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/09/21/the-microstrategy-effect-this-firm-is-helping-businesses-save-in-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/416b064a6d4da10cf30844b39f5f3d6cad5d5234-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to a Sept. 16 filing by the Massachusetts AG's office, PlexCorp's leadership used Stripe to defraud millions of dollars from thousands of investors, including 22 in Massachusetts, between August and September 2017.  PlexCoin's Canadian backers raised $15 million during the height of the ICO boom by pitching their product as ""the next decentralized worldwide cryptocurrency,"" as previously reported by CoinDesk.  But the offering quickly drew scrutiny from Canadian and U.S. regulators. It became the first targeted for prosecution by the Securities and Exchange Commission's crypto-focused Cyber Unit in December 2017.  Stripe ""terminated"" the ICO's accounts that September. It lacked adequate ""risk monitoring"" and ""fraud prevention"" tactics to move faster, Massachusetts AG Maura Healey alleged.  The firm has since bolstered its protections and has pledged to assist Healey in her office's ongoing investigations, according to the terms of the settlement.  In return for Stripe's payment, the AG's office agreed to not pursue any civil action against the firm, according to the settlement.

Top shelf    ‘New battlefield’ China’s central bank gave an inside look into its motivations for developing a digital currency (CBDC) for retail and governmental use. In a commentary published by China Finance, a local magazine, People’s Bank of China (PBOC) officials said its DCEP (digital currency electric payment) system is essential in weakening the dollar's role in international finance and could open a ""new battlefield"" between nations. The DCEP has been in development for six years – during which the government has filed 130 related patents – and is now in testing at banks and corporations in a number of regions.      DeFi dividend Curve, the third largest DeFi project by “total value locked,” has instituted a new dividend program for holders of its governance token, CRV. CoinDesk’s Brady Dale reports that trading fees on the platform now will be split between liquidity providers (LPs) and veCRV holders, a form of escrow token that users obtain by staking their CRV to the voting contract. Each trade on the platform incurs a 0.04% trading fee, which has totalled between $70,000 and $150,000 per day last week, based on daily volumes in the $400,000,000 range. “We’ll start moving towards a cashflow-based protocol because the numbers are too sweet to not do it,” Curve founder Michael Egorov told CoinDesk in an email.      Crypto mining Three Iranian power plants will allow cryptocurrency miners to buy energy directly from their facilities, in a bid to create new revenue streams. A Thermal Power Plant Holding Company (TPPH), which owns and operates plants all across Iran, executive said, “the necessary equipment has been installed in three power plants of Ramin, Neka, and Shahid Montazeri, and the auction documents will be uploaded on the SetadIran.ir website in the near future.” Iran recognized crypto mining as a legitimate business activity in July 2019. An estimated 1,000 mining licenses were issued in the first six months under the new rules.      IDO? APY.Finance, a yet-to-launch DeFi yield farming aggregator, has completed a $3.6M seed funding round joined by Arrington XRP Capital, Alameda Research, Cluster Capital and CoinGecko. The automated investment service will use the cash to develop and audit its platform, which will offer opportunities to earn yields across a variety of DeFi products in a “in a risk/reward optimized way,” according to its press release. APY.Finance said it’s targeting mid-October for a full-scale rollout of its platform, and has plans for a public sale of its governance token, APY, in what its calling an ""Initial DEX Offering"" this month.    Quick bites  Did Ethereum Learn Anything From the $55M DAO Attack? (Daniel Kuhn/CoinDesk)  Lyn Alden’s Latest: Why Currency Devaluation Is Inevitable(NLW/The Breakdown)  How Does Kraken’s New Crypto Bank Work? (Adam Levine/CoinDesk)  Bitcoin Blockchain Grows to 300 Gigabytes in Size (Liam Frost/Decrypt)  DEXs rake in the retail volume while institutions stay on the sidelines (Frank Chaparro/The Block)  At stake    Suspicious circumstances Cryptocurrencies are often dismissed in the circles of traditional banking and finance for their associations with crime. Earlier this year, the New York Times’ crypto reporter, Nathaniel Popper, penned the article “Bitcoin Has Lost Steam. But Criminals Still Love It.” Implicit in the article: What else could unstoppable, non-state backed money be used for but crime?      Frequently absent from the discussion is the role that the dominant banking infrastructure plays in the world of crime. This weekend, Buzzfeed peeked under the hood.      According to thousands of documents compiled by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a U.S. watchdog, and seen by Buzzfeed, potentially trillions of dollars of dirty money are flowing through the world’s largest banks.      From 2011 and 2017, the banks’ internal compliance teams reported to FinCEN thousands of suspicious activity reports (SARs), or activity deemed out of the ordinary and potentially fraudulent. SARs are just the concerns of compliance officers and not necessarily evidence of fraud.      The files show Deutsche Bank flagged a total of $1.3 trillion, JPMorgan approximately $500 billion and Bank of America another $384 billion. BNY Mellon underlined a total of $64 billion in 325 separate SARs filed with FinCEN, making it the second-most-frequent filer in the leaked documents, CoinDesk reporter Paddy Baker wrote.      Further, between 2012 and 2015, nine big banks paid approximately $20 billion in fines for money laundering, Bloomberg reported.      While at least one of the SARs related to the multi-billion dollar OneCoin crypto project, determined to be a pyramid scheme by investigators, the report is a reminder that banks, too, aid and abet criminal behavior.    Market intel    Selling pressure Bitcoin is facing selling pressure Monday amid coronavirus-led risk aversion in the stock markets, CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reports. The cryptocurrency is trading near $10,650 at press time, down 2.9% on the day, having faced rejection near $11,000 earlier on Monday. This follows a decline in European stocks and U.S. stock futures amid news of worsening pandemic conditions across Europe. Bitcoin could suffer a bigger drop if the risk aversion worsens, triggering a dash for the U.S. dollar, as happened in March. Meanwhile, resistances are seen at $11,000 and $11,183 (Sept. 19 high).    Op-ed    Kraken open CoinDesk’s Director of Research Noelle Acheson thinks Kraken’s application to become the U.S.’ first crypto bank is not a repudiation of its founding values, but an indication that the world is adapting to crypto. “The SPDI [Special Purpose Depositary Institution] is a new type of bank charter that was created with the crypto industry in mind. A new set of definitions and protections was drawn up to take into account crypto asset characteristics. A state passed financial legislation for the crypto industry,” she writes in the latest Crypto Long & Short newsletter. You can subscribe here.

42405073,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeKx1V,1600699653,"Former HSBC, Citigroup, Merrill Lynch Asia Execs Start $50M Crypto Fund","Banking veterans who have steered divisions at HSBC, Citigroup and Merrill Lynch in the Asia-Pacific region are ditching traditional finance to invest in cryptocurrencies.    People familiar with the matter told CoinDesk that Joseph Chang, head of equities trading and prime finance at Merrill Lynch, HSBC and Citigroup Asia-Pacific from 1997 to 2016, and Grahame Webb, head of technology from 2013 to 2018 for HSBC and Citigroup Asia-Pacific prime finance and securities services, have been trading cryptocurrencies since June through a new Hong Kong-based fund, Liquibit Capital.  Liquibit Capital, also managed by a former Barclays Capital vice president and two current JPMorgan and Wells Fargo technicians, will manage assets worth $50 million, the people said.  Liquibit is said to arbitrage a portfolio of bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ether, litecoin and eos, custodied with Fireblocks.  It is expected to expand to trading derivatives, options and futures on BitMEX, Huobi, OKEx and Deribit – cryptocurrency exchanges with a largely Asia-based presence.  Chang, now Liquibit Capital's chief investment officer, said regulatory bloat and a surplus of middlemen while trading at investment banks convinced him and his partners to switch to cryptocurrency markets.

42405091,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeKxHF,1600699096,DAOs Will Never Govern the World (at This Pace),"The enthusiasm for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) continues to gain momentum as the crypto industry recognizes that monetary systems need governance.      Yet, the gap between promise and implementation is demonstrated by the incidence of rage quitting, forking (where a blockchain splits in two because the existing protocol is changed) and abandonment of DAOs. Despite millions of dollars having been invested in development, DAOs suffer from a failure to find product–market fit. How did this happen?      It starts with the emphasis on revenue and profit-making.      DAO technology is not a better way to run businesses. Businesses are running just fine. It’s not a better way to raise or allocate money. People know how to raise and allocate money. DAO technology should be applied to areas we haven’t solved yet, areas where everyone’s interest is at stake and therefore everyone should have a say.    Grace (Rebecca) Rachmany is the founder of DAO Leadership and is the co-author of So You’ve Got a DAO: Leadership for the 21st Century. This essay placed second in the ""Decentralized Futures"" writing contest, organized by NESTA, a U.K. innovation foundation.    People are seeking new forms of organization in areas where hierarchical organizations are failing: public health, climate change, preservation of cultures, inequality, etc. DAOs offer the potential to organize collective intelligence to address complex questions and manage shared resources. In a recent talk at ETHDenver, DAOstack founder Matan Field announced the move towards governance of common resources rather than businesses, and The Commons Stack has the word ""commons"" in its name, signaling a clear aim of creating tools to maintain the commons. Yet, the actual tech still falls short.      In 2019 and early 2020, the blockchain industry observed dozens of attempts at creating DAOs, most of them ending in failures or partial solutions, as reviewed in recent DAO case study research by the author, funded through the Genesis DAO. The source of these failures was twofold: application of DAO technology to organizations that don’t need a DAO; and limiting the capabilities to budget allocation and voting. Because of their myopic focus on ""on-chain"" governance of blockchains, the DAO technologists have failed to create compelling technology for the problems that society is facing.    The appeal of the DAO movement is fueled by the sense that almost all of the democratic processes are broken in today’s society.  Moving beyond money and voting    To date, technologies such as Aragon, Colony, DAOstack, GovBlocks, Moloch and other DAO tech projects have had one primary function: allocation of funds, more specifically, cryptocurrency (usually ethereum or dai). In some way, this is the only function you can implement on a group that has not preformed. If you start with a neighborhood, a political party, gamers playing a specific game or other group with a common interest, you can implement and enforce decisions. If all you have is a random group of participants, you can’t impose much of anything on the group behavior other than allocation of budget. If you want automated allocation through a smart contract, the budget needs to be in Ethereum.      In other words, the technologists have built systems that are close to useless for anyone outside of their small circle. As a result, there are dozens of ""zombie"" DAOs, organizations that were created but are no longer active. These failures contribute to the outside perception that DAOs are just a fad or scam.    What is needed for collective governance?    The appeal of the DAO movement is fueled by the sense that almost all of the democratic processes are broken in today’s society – in that, despite ever greater interconnection, our national and international governance structures are failing to solve problems of the commons. Mismanagement of public health, food supply, water and air quality has dire impacts worldwide. Whether we like it or not, the actions of one person in Wuhan can have global ramifications.      See also: Newest DAO Project Was Thrown a Curve, but the Team Is Rolling With It Anyway      Organizations such as the United Nations, World Health Organization and World Bank are neither democratic nor designed to collect intelligence and respond efficiently and effectively to complex issues. The problems with these control-and-command structures have become painfully evident in the current health crisis. On every level, citizens’ interests are pushed aside for the interests of big business, political heavyweights and even foreign interests who have captured the media. The idea of a DAO appeals to people because the current systems are simply inadequate to meet complex global challenges.      Unfortunately, DAO technologists have tried to map simple systems onto complex issues, rather than referring to historically successful models for governing commons. The current public health crisis is an example of the failure of centralized systems to govern a common good.      While we don’t have large-scale models for commons governance, we do have examples of how commons are managed on a small to medium scale.      Examples include neighborhood and community councils, cooperatives and traditions of Indigenous peoples for preserving the environment as well as justice and social cohesion. A neighborhood committee may require people to keep their lawns mowed and their sidewalks shoveled, and if you do not, someone will knock on your door and let you know. In Indigenous communities, rituals and traditions are enforced through storytelling and social norms.      In other words, social norms and social enforcement are the proven methodologies for commons governance. Incentives are proven to polarize and exploit public goods. Whether the incentive comes in the form of financial compensation, attention to a social media post or improved page ranking, all types of incentive are distorting behaviors in undesirable ways. In a commons, decisions tend to be reached by deliberation, mutual respect, consideration of environmental carrying capacity and consensus.    Collective governance: Opportunities    It is possible to use technology to govern common resources for large communities. To facilitate better commons-based intelligence and decision-making, DAO technology needs to address the following aspects of collective governance. (Identity and reputation are key elements as well, but these are beyond the scope of this paper.)    Inclusive discussion and respectful discourse    To make good decisions on complex issues (e.g. public health), participants need to feel safe to express divisive perspectives and have the listening skills and willingness to consider opposing opinions. During the COVID-19 crisis, the WHO implemented wholesale censorship across both traditional media and social media. Even within the scientific community, open discussion is censored. This top-down control is reducing the variety of discussion and proposals that could potentially be considered. In a healthy ecosystem, multiple perspectives could be considered and tested. The structure of a DAO has potential for better sense-making and richer discussion.      While many social media platforms have caused increased antisocial behaviour, well-designed systems can cause better sense-making. One of the earliest and most long-standing threaded chat platforms, Slashdot.org, included mechanisms for people to indicate the quality of others’ responses to discussions and to acquire reputation over time. Loomio offers a discussion platform with mechanisms that encourage collaboration and safety. More work needs to be done to develop platforms and mechanisms for inclusion that are not driven by market incentives, but rather designed to provide psychologically safe places for thoughtful discussion and deep consideration of alternative viewpoints and ideas. Recently, the emergence of channels such as Rebel Wisdom and The Stoa have shown the public’s desire for in-depth discussion, but these are generally moderated discussions between experts and not designed for the general public to engage in such discourse.    Recognition of facts and perspectives    The focus on ""signaling"" and ""preferences"" ignores facts and expertise. Intelligent decisions include both facts and perspectives. Factual information must be presented as factual, along with information about the clarity or reliability of the information. Scientific studies and known use cases are different from people’s opinions and perspectives. Perspectives are equally important, however. It may be factual that an infectious disease is fatal, and it may be factual that social distancing is causing a rise in suicide and addiction and having a long-term impact on mental health. Facts and statistics can be presented to decision- makers about all of these impacts, but facts are not sufficient: people’s values determine what result is ‘best’ for them. Different cultures and segments of the population have different values about the importance of these impacts. Decision-makers require both reliable facts and multiple perspectives.      See also: The DAO: Or How A Leaderless Ethereum Project Raised $50 Million    DAOs today allow anyone to propose anything, but they don’t recognize or reward collaboration or creativity.    Contemporary research of Dr. Anna De Liddo of the Knowledge Management Institute has led to a number of demonstrations of collaboration platforms that help people form better opinions and improve critical thinking. By developing a platform where people must discuss evidence for their claims, her team is looking at how to create a safe environment that allows recognition of expertise and encourages people to understand the content of a claim as well as its source. The Consider.it platform developed by Dr. Travis Kriplean offers a discussion platform designed to help people reach. a deeper understanding of each others’ viewpoints and provide visualization to describe the reasoning behind those opinions.    Problem definition and prioritization    The problems we face as humanity affect different populations in different ways. Depending on your perspective, damming a river could have positive or negative effects. Almost every interesting problem has paradoxes. Problem definition needs to take into account multiple perspectives, and problem definition must be a prerequisite to proposal-making.      None of the DAO platforms to date have capabilities for problem definition. Yet without problem definition, how can a community determine if a proposal has merit?      See also: Kevin Werbach – How Data Centralization Ends by 2030      Communities need a way to define and prioritize the issues to address. Some platforms, such as Canonizer, identify issues based on the volume of discussion and provide intelligence about how divisive the issues are to a community. However, just because an issue is interesting and divisive doesn’t make it a priority. People may feel very strongly about the gender denomination of bathrooms, but most would agree that it is not as important as the curriculum of the school in which the bathroom is located.    Proposal-making and selection    If a ballot has only bad or mediocre options, democracy is meaningless. Organizations use multiple methodologies to brainstorm, compose and revise propositions. DAOs today allow anyone to propose anything, but they don’t recognize or reward collaboration or creativity. While platforms such as Aragon and DAOstack encourage a period of informal discussion and deliberation on proposals, it’s not required.      Aragon enables periodic voting schedules, so discussion is conducted over a period of time, and then voting is on a tranche of proposals together. The DAOstack paradigm allows ongoing proposal-making, so people are voting on proposals as they appear, without comparison to past (or future) proposals.      This type of yes/no, ""first come, first served"" proposal-making favors speed and competition over collaboration, deep thought or consideration of minority perspectives. Making decisions this way is like walking down a street and deciding whether to eat at a restaurant without knowing what restaurants are around the corner.    One of the great failures of democracy is the disconnect between law-making and results being accomplished.    You must make a yes/no decision for one option at a time, and if a majority always wins, the person who is vegan may go hungry. The Holographic Consensus mechanism on DAOstack prioritizes popular proposals, but more testing is needed to see if it’s effective. The most popular proposal isn’t always the wisest one.      Distributed technologies have the promise to create a wide variety of solutions for inclusion, but so far, none of the systems in place have demonstrated sufficient capacity for inclusion of minority interests or interests of people with less (or no) capital to invest in the DAO.      See also: Pooja Shah – How Web 3.0 Creates Value for Users, Not Platforms      Quadratic voting, such as that implemented by Democracy Earth, allows people to express strong preferences for specific issues in situations where there is equality of representation to begin with. However, when it comes to cryptocurrency and funding of DAOs, representation is always relative to the amount of money that someone donates, even in quadratic funding, and the funding is independent of the people who are affected by the voting and funding.      For example, Black Girls Code recently raised funding on the Gitcoin grants platform through quadratic funding. The voters are the funders, not the black girls who will be affected by the grant. While there is nothing intrinsically wrong with that, it isn’t a form of democracy where those affected by a decision are those who make the decision. Similarly in the Colorado example of quadratic voting, by the way. The democratic representatives of the people participate in the quadratic voting; the people they represent did not.    Accountability    One of the great failures of democracy is the disconnect between law-making and results being accomplished. Laws are implemented and continued for decades without review of whether their execution and implementation has accomplished the desired outcome; and when they do come under review, there often is no mechanism for repealing the law, but only to improve or adjust the execution of the law. DAO technology needs to include feedback mechanisms that will allow rapid adjustment when the measures are not met.      DAO technology has excelled in automated execution of decisions. For code changes, this is a complete process. Aragon and GovBlocks include mechanisms that allow code to be integrated automatically into the blockchain. However, this approach falls short when it comes to distribution of funds. Groups and individuals receive funds upon approval of their proposals, but none of the DAO systems to date include an accountability process If the funds are misused or absconded with, there is no mechanism for holding the group accountable for the work. Recent work by the SEEDS project on Hypha DAO technology is developing a mechanism for escrow and then a release mechanism, which will increase accountability.      See also: There’s Now a DAO for Deciding Which Blockchains to Stake On      Accountability for more complex problems is even more difficult to track. For example, to improve the water quality of a river, it’s not enough to just execute a proposal; the water quality needs to be measured. It’s quite possible that the idea doesn’t prove itself in reality or that additional measures are required. Feedback loops should be developed to identify when decisions are incorrect, and adjustments made.    Conclusions    The promise of DAOs has been to create more advanced decision-making systems. Yet, to date, the DAO technology has provided little more than voting and funds allocation mechanisms. To govern at a global level has become an imperative in the pandemic, which affects all human beings on earth. Managing this crisis and those to come requires the development of technologies that cover all aspects of discussion, collaboration, proposal-making and accountability.",NEGATIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | FORKS,Grace Rebecca Rachmany,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/09/21/daos-will-never-govern-the-world-at-this-pace,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/35416b6aa009c8d9704a63636fd4779228588a11-2480x3508.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405089,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeKxGG,1600695414,First Mover: Digital Gold Narrative Could Be Bitcoin's Lone Ace as Ethereum Gains,"It's pretty much guaranteed at this point that higher inflation is coming.      The Federal Reserve, which has already printed about $3 trillion of new money this year, is now explicitly devoted to reducing the dollar's purchasing power in a bid to revive the economy. Higher inflation also typically happens when a country gets laden with debt and interest rates are cut to zero, as is now the case in the U.S.      ""We're at a moment where you may see some inflation,"" Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard said last week.      The trend could be good for bitcoin, which many crypto investors believe can serve as a hedge against inflation, a digital and perhaps more portable alternative to gold. As detailed last week by SeekingAlpha contributor Lyn Alden, the trend has been clear since roughly 1980, when the share of wealth held by the world's richest 0.1% of people began a decades-long rise from about 5% to more than 20%.      But increasingly, it looks like bitcoin-as-inflation-hedge might be the cryptocurrency's most compelling investment narrative, and not necessarily as the dominant digital asset for perpetuity, as many so-called bitcoin maximalists have argued.      Last week, bitcoin's ""dominance"" – the market value of all bitcoins in existence, divided by the market value of all digital assets – fell to 57%, from 68% at the start of the year, according to CoinMarketCap.      The primary challenger, of course, is ether (ETH), the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, which has exploded with activity this year as the primary venue for the fast-growing realm of decentralized finance, or DeFi. Ether's market value has climbed to about 12% of the industry total, from about 6.8% at the start of the year.      ""The rivalry between Bitcoin 'maximalists' and Ethereum enthusiasts has become more polarized in recent months, with each side latching on to narratives that best support the asset to which they have pledged their allegiance,"" Kevin Kelly, co-founder of the market-analysis firm Delphi Digital, wrote this month in report. And recently, Ethereum has been ""playing catch-up to its 'digital gold' counterpart.""    Bitcoin Watch    Bitcoin is again taking cues from traditional markets.      The leading cryptocurrency is dropping alongside stocks, with soaring coronavirus cases across Europe and other parts of the world threatening to snuff out the nascent global economic recovery.      Bitcoin is currently down over 2% at $10,650 and may suffer a more significant drop if the risk aversion worsens, boosting demand for the safe-haven U.S. dollar. The cryptocurrency tanked 40% on March 12 as the global stocks' coronavirus-induced crash triggered a global dash for cash.      The recent rise in the outflow of coins from miner wallets to exchanges could add to bearish pressures around bitcoin.      On Sunday, 784 BTC were transferred to exchange wallets from miner wallets – significantly higher than the 30-day average daily outflow of 265 BTC, according to data source Glassnode.      – Omkar Godbole      Read more: Bitcoin Down as Stocks Fall Over European Coronavirus Fears    Token Watch    Curve (CRV): Decentralized stablecoin exchange starts new dividend program for holders of governance token.

42405077,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeKx5R,1600689614,Three Iranian Power Plants Plan to Sell Electricity to Crypto Miners,"Three Iranian power plants with enough output to supply half of New York City will soon begin selling surplus electricity to cryptocurrency miners, in a bid to create a new source of revenue.    Thermal Power Plant Holding Company (TPPH), which owns and operates plants all across Iran, said crypto miners could now offer to buy electricity from three of its power stations, according to a report from the Tehran Times.  “The necessary equipment has been installed in three power plants of Ramin, Neka and Shahid Montazeri, and the auction documents will be uploaded on the SetadIran.ir website in the near future,” said TPPH head Mohsen Tarztalab.  Together, the three plants have a combined power output of 5,485 megawatt-hours.  Iran recognized crypto mining as a legitimate business activity in July 2019; it's estimated the government issued a 1,000 mining licenses in the first six months of the new regime.  While there has been confusion over the policy, Iran's share of global bitcoin mining output has increased to nearly 4% – almost double that in September 2019.  Although faced by rising production costs, Iranian power plants have to supply power to the national grid at fixed prices. Tarztalab said selling power to crypto miners would help them remain profitable.  TPPH would only sell power generated from turbines that don't supply the national grid, Tarztalab said.  Both the Ramin and Neka plants rely on natural gas, which releases roughly half the amount of carbon from other fossil fuels, such as coal; Shahid Montazeri is powered by oil from a nearby refinery.

42405088,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeKxEI,1600686733,Bitcoin Down as Stocks Fall Over European Coronavirus Fears,"Bitcoin is facing selling pressure Monday amid coronavirus-led risk aversion in the stock markets.    Bitcoin is trading in the red near $10,650 at press time, down 2.9% on the day, having faced rejection near $11,000 earlier on Monday.  A decline in European stocks and U.S. stock futures and a rise in the U.S. dollar look to be weighing over the top cryptocurrency by market cap.  Major European indices like Germany's DAX, France's CAC, and the U.K.'s FTSE are down more than 3%, according to data source investing.com.  Futures tied to Wall Street's S&P 500 index are also down nearly 2%, but the dollar index, which tracks the greenback's value against major currencies, is up 0.5%.  Investors are selling equities on fears the recent resurgence of COVID-19 cases across Europe could unleash a new round of economic damage.  The epidemic is doubling roughly every seven days in the U.K., and if the trend continues there would be about 50,000 new cases per day by the middle of October, according to the British government’s chief scientific adviser.  The U.K. may be forced to bring in new lockdowns; other European countries from Denmark to Greece have already imposed restrictions.  Bitcoin could suffer a bigger drop if the risk aversion worsens, triggering a dash for the U.S. dollar, a global reserve currency, as happened in March.  Additionally, a recent rise in the flow of coins from miner wallets to exchanges could add to bearish pressures around bitcoin.  On Sunday, 784 BTC (worth roughly $8 million) were transferred to exchange wallets from miner wallets – significantly higher than the 30-day average daily outflow of 265 BTC, according to data source Glassnode.  Miners and investors usually move coins to exchanges to liquidate their holdings.  As such, a price drop and a pick-up in volatility could be in the offing, unless buying pressure is strong enough to absorb the additional miner supply.  A possible head-and-shoulders breakdown, a bearish pattern, seen on the hourly chart may expose the 100-day average support located near $10,400.  Meanwhile, resistances are seen at $11,000 and $11,183 (Sept. 19 high).

42405075,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeKx3T,1600684654,FinCEN Files: BNY Mellon Processed $137M for Entities Linked to OneCoin,"One of America's oldest banks wired over a hundred million dollars in funds linked to the crypto Ponzi scheme OneCoin, according to a trove of documents leaked from the U.S.' financial crimes watchdog.      In February 2017, the Bank of New York Mellon (BNY Mellon) flagged a number of transactions with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) it deemed suspicious as they appeared to be ""layered"" – a money-laundering technique that hides the source of funds through sending multiple transactions.      Worth a combined $137 million, the bank said these transactions came from entities linked to OneCoin – a crypto scheme the U.S. government accused of being a Ponzi. It's estimated OneCoin raised a total of $4 billion from investors, making it one of the most successful schemes of its kind ever.      Buzzfeed received thousands of leaked suspicious activity reports (SARs) from 2011 and 2017 that show instances when a bank's compliance team flagged a transaction they consider out of the ordinary and possibly suspect with FinCEN.      Dubbed the ""FinCEN files,"" the trove of 2,657 documents gives an indication of how much dirty money may be passing through some of the world's biggest banks. As SARs are just the concerns of compliance officers, they are not necessarily evidence of wrongdoing by themselves.      The files show Deutsche Bank flagged a total of $1.3 trillion, JPMorgan approximately $500 billion and Bank of America another $384 billion. BNY Mellon underlined a total of $64 billion in 325 separate SARs filed with FinCEN, making it the second-most-frequent filer in the leaked documents.      See also: UK Watchdog Eyes Extension of Money Laundering Risk Reporting to Crypto Firms      Buzzfeed shared the FinCEN files with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), which showed one particular transaction in 2016 where Fenero Equity Investments, a British Virgin Islands-based company, wired approximately $30 million from its account at DMS Bank & Trust, a Cayman-based bank, to BNY Mellon.      Fenero described the payment as a ""loan for CryptoReal"" – an investment trust set up by OneCoin founder Ruja Ignatova, who has not been seen since late 2017.      In a SAR filed at the time, BNY Mellon's compliance team said Fenero often received wires from shell entities linked to OneCoin. It sent the money on to Hong Kong's DBS Bank, where it was credited to a local company called Barta Holdings.      Emails seized by U.S. authorities last year shows Mark Scott, the New York attorney convicted last year of laundering $400 million for OneCoin, arranged the $30 million loan from Fenero to allegedly purchase an oilfield from Barta Holdings.      But the seized emails show the loan was never repaid and that $10 million of the amount sent to Barta Holdings was actually spent by one of the OneCoin co-founders.      ""I believe that the $30 million purported 'loan' from Fenero to Barta was arranged by Scott to launder OneCoin Ltd. proceeds to CC-2 [OneCoin's co-founder],"" said testimony from special agent Kurt Hafer, attached to the New York Attorney's office.      See also: US Moves to Seize $400M From Convicted OneCoin Money Launderer      A BNY Mellon spokesperson told ICIJ the bank fully complied with existing financial regulation and took its role in protecting the integrity of the global financial system seriously.

Reported by Reuters Monday, the article said that among the benefits of the digital currency – dubbed DCEP, for digital currency electric payment – would be the weakening of the dollar's role in international fiannce in favor of the yuan.  China Finance said the ability to issue and control a digital currency would herald a new area of competition – a ""new battlefield"" between nations.  Another advantage of the DCEP system would be the better feedback of payments data, which could help better promote monetary policy.  That, in turn, could help economic recovery post-coronavirus, according to the article.  The digital yuan has been in development for six years and is now in testing at banks and corporations in a number of regions.  The article also highlighted the extensive research that has gone into the project, citing the 130 patent applications that have been lodged so far.  These span cryptocurrency issuance, circulations and related apps, forming a supply chain that would support DCEP, the central bank magazine said.
