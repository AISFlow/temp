42427365,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK1eRh,1486675822,China Fears Spread Beyond Bitcoin As Crypto Markets Slide,"The digital currency markets experienced widespread price declines today, as concerns surrounding the latest developments in China motivated many traders to sell off not only bitcoin, but alternative digital assets.  The development follows the PBoC's announcement today that it warned several domestic exchange operators that they must comply with regulations or risk being shut down. Traders also received startling news from major operations Huobi and OKCoin that, effective immediately, they would suspend bitcoin withdrawals for one month.  Markets reacted strongly to these developments, with bitcoin prices falling to as little as $942 at 14:30 UTC, a more than 10% decline from the opening price, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  The digital currency then recovered, rising to $975.21 at the time of report.  Yet, even after this increase, bitcoin prices were still roughly 7.5% lower for the session, BPI figures show.  Impact spreads  Even in alternative digital asset markets, the impact of the development in bitcoin was widely felt.  Ether, which powers the smart contract-based platform ethereum and is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, fell to as little as $10.67 on CoinMarketCap, down close to 7% since the start of the day.  The digital token then recovered lost ground, reaching $10.92 at the time of report. Yet, even after making these gains, ether was roughly 4.8% lower for the session at time of writing.  Ether classic, which was created roughly six months ago as a result of an ethereum hard fork, provided the most striking example of a price decline, dropping upwards of 20% for the day to $1.20 on CoinMarketCap, after trading at $1.47 at 12:04 UTC.  The digital currency, which helps power the smart contract-based platform ethereum classic, later rose to $1.28 at the time of report.  At this price, ether was roughly 12% lower for the day.  Monero, a digital currency that leverages ring signatures to help provide market participants with a high level of privacy, fell to as little as $11.83 during the day, close to 8% below the price of $12.83 at 12:04 UTC, according to CoinMarketCap.  At the time of report, the digital currency had recovered slightly, trading at $11.91, still more than 7% lower for the session.  The fact that digital currency prices suffered widespread declines today, and then proceeded to recover, is merely part of a broader trend, Jacob Eliosoff told CoinDesk.  He emphasized that in some cases, news that bodes poorly for bitcoin ""may actually help (or at least be neutral for) other major coins."" He pointed to a bug in bitcoin's blockchain or a major disagreement between bitcoin developers as potential examples.  However, news that causes bitcoin prices to push lower usually has the same effect on the price of altcoins, he said.  The high correlation that exists between the price of digital currencies may simply be a sign of the market’s immaturity. Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency to scale, and has grabbed the lion's share of the total market capitalization owned by these digital assets. (In most cases, you have to buy bitcoin before purchasing other altcoins).  Watch and wait  However, several altcoins have risen to prominence by offering some compelling value not provided by bitcoin.  Ethereum, whose currency ether had a market capitalization of roughly $970m at the time of report, has drawn interest by offering developers a platform where they can create applications that rely on smart contracts.  Likewise, Monero, the fifth-largest digital currency by market capitalization according to CoinMarketCap, has carved out its own niche by offering a level of privacy far higher than that of bitcoin.  In this way, Eliosoff and others are hoping that the ""extreme correlation"" that exists between the prices of digital currencies today will diminish over time as more establish singular use cases and establish unique infrastructure.  As evidenced by today's moves, however, this development remains in the distance.

According to court documents filed on 1st February and unsealed yesterday, Jeffrey Wertkin sought to sell a criminal complaint related to a whistleblower case for $310,000, asking that he be paid in bitcoin for the offer.  Wertkin, who was arrested on 31st January, was previously a partner for Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld, a major Washington, DC-based law practice and lobbying firm. According to OpenSecrets.org, the firm's clients include AT&T, Volkswagen and Mobil Oil, among others.  Wertkin also served six years as a trial lawyer for the US Justice Department, The New York Times reported yesterday.  Court documents show that Wertkin reached out to an unnamed employee of a California cybersecurity firm, ultimately moving to sell that individual sealed information related to a complaint that had been filed against the company.  Using the moniker ""Dan"", Wertkin sent a partial copy of the complaint to the company, offering a full copy in exchange for $310,000 in bitcoin.  The filing states:  ""...Dan suggested to EMPLOYEE that Dan be paid in bitcoin and explained to EMPLOYEE how bitcoin worked and that the advantage to bitcoin was that it could not be traced.""  Wertkin and the employee, after a series of additional conversations, were scheduled to meet at the Hilton Garden Inn in Cupertino, California. FBI agent William Scanlon, who submitted the affidavit, was waiting nearby in the place of the tech company employee.  Once the copy of the complaint was handed to Scanlon, other FBI agents quickly moved in to arrest Wertkin, who, according to the affidavit, ""was wearing a wig which I believed was to conceal his identity"".  ""My life is over,"" Wertkin reportedly said as he was arrested.

42427340,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK1dxh,1486664373,Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF Offering Expands to $100 Million,"New documents filed for the bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF) sought by investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss reveal that the size of the offering has grown to $100m.  The years-long effort – delayed more than once by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) – is aimed at providing a means for investors to gain exposure to bitcoin without actually having to buy the digital currency.  The SEC is expected to make a decision on the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF later this year, with its self-imposed deadline of 11th March inching closer. Speculation around the approval is such that at least one exchange has moved to offer a prediction market, letting traders bet on the possible outcome.  Documents  submitted to the SEC on 8th February show that the planned offering has changed somewhat in scope.  For example, the size of the offering has increased, from $65m to $100m, as well as a boost in the number of shares being offered, from 1m shares to 10m shares. The filing goes on to indicate that the maximum offering price per share has been lowered, from $65 down to just $10.  Notably, the filing also features new language about the prospect of a network split following a software hard fork, or a backwards-incompatible change to bitcoin’s underlying code.  In that circumstance, the filing states, the ETF’s custodian will support the blockchain that has “the greatest cumulative computational difficulty for the forty-eight (48) hour period following a given hard fork”. During that 48-hour period, the creation or redemption of new ETF baskets will be suspended.  The filing goes on to state:  “If the Custodian, in consultation with the Sponsor, is unable to make a conclusive determination about which Bitcoin Network has the greatest cumulative computational difficulty after forty-eight (48) hours, or determines in good faith that this is not a reasonable criterion upon which to make a determination, the Custodian will support the Bitcoin Network which it deems in good faith is most likely to be supported by a greater number of users and miners.”  The new filing also includes other minor updates such as the companies that will act as authorized participants. These firms are Convergex Execution Solutions LLC, KCG Americas LLC and Virtu Financial BD LLC.

42427346,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK1e5h,1486655759,China's Bitcoin Exchanges Impose Fees Following Central Bank Meeting,"The era of no-fee trading in China appears to be over.  Following in the footsteps of China's 'Big Three' exchanges, smaller competitors BTC Trade, BTC100, CHBTC, Dahonghuo, Yuanbao and BitBays all moved to impose or increase trading fees yesterday in the wake of a meeting with the People's Bank of China, China's central bank.  Both BTC Trade and CHBTC said that the fees would come into force on 13th February, whereas the other exchanges did not identify a starting date. Further, with the exception of BTC 100 and BitBays, the exchanges all moved to add 0.2% maker and taker fees.  BitBays is now charging 0.1% maker fees and 0.15% taker fees, while BTC 100 announced that it would begin collecting trading fees, without adding details. Yunbi, in turn, announced a reduction in trading fees two days ago, dropping its trading fees from 0.2% to 0.05%.  It was not immediately clear at press time whether Jubi – another of the exchanges to meet with the PBoC – had made a similar move.  The developments come on the heels of a new warning from the PBoC to domestic bitcoin exchanges about the need for tighter anti-money laundering and foreign exchange controls. Two of China's ""Big Three"" exchanges – Huobi and OKCoin – went on to freeze bitcoin and litecoin withdrawals, stating that the new policy would last for one month.  Fee policy changes  at Huobi, OKCoin and BTCC had previously driven volume to no-fee exchanges – a trend that is now unlikely given the updates across the sector.  Notably, Yuanbao and BitBays explicitly referenced regulatory concerns in their messages. By contrast, BTC Trade said it had moved to add fees ""in order to curb speculation [and] to prevent price speculation"", a message echoed in CHBTC's post.

At press time, prices were down more than 7% after word emerged this morning that two of China’s biggest bitcoin exchanges – Beijing-based OKCoin and Huobi – are freezing bitcoin and litecoin withdrawals for a month following pressure from the People's Bank of China.  Yuan deposits and withdrawals are not affected, the exchanges said.  Markets had been hovering around $1,063 when the news broke, though this has now changed as the market seeks to price in the news.  According to the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), prices fell as much as $80, hitting a low of $958.56. BPI data shows that prices had previously hit a high of $1,077.76 earlier today.  At press time, bitcoin prices are at an average of $988.  CNY-denominated markets were down more than 13% from their peak on the news at one point, according to the BPI, falling from a high of ¥7,598.92 to an average of ¥6,755.52.  However, the price was up 5% on the day at press time, indicating traders were perhaps viewing the news as a buying opportunity.  Real-time response  So far, market observers appear to be reacting with a mixture of surprise and concern when reached for comment.  OTC trader Zhao Dong indicated that he expected further price weakening stoked by traders ""since you can only deposit coins and sell"" in light of the exchange policy changes.  Kong Gao, overseas marketing director at OTC trading firm Richfund, remarked more simply, stating:  ""This is big news.""  CoinDesk will continue monitoring this developing story.

42427349,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK1e9h,1486645249,Two of China's Biggest Exchanges Stop Bitcoin Withdrawals,"UPDATE (9th February 16:22 BST): This article has been updated with new information regarding BTCC’s bitcoin and litecoin withdrawal policy.      Yuan recharge, withdrawals and other services will not be affected, the exchanges said.  In public posts that showcase the increasingly coordinated nature of exchange policy in the region, both OKCoin and Huobi said today that the move was a bid to bolster their anti-money laundering (AML) capabilities and prevent ""illegal transactions"". In the case of OKCoin, only it's OKCoin.cn portal is affected.  Both OKCoin and Huobi indicated that their platforms would now go through an “upgrade” to combat “money laundering, exchange, pyramid schemes and other illegal activities”, though no further details were provided.  Following the publication of this article, BTCC announced that it would also upgrade its internal systems. In the meantime, the exchange said, bitcoin and litecoin withdrawals will take 72 hours to process.  All told, the move comes amid a rocky period for local exchanges that began with the wider scrutiny of major bitcoin exchanges by the People's Bank of China (PBOC), the country's central bank.  Earlier today, China's central bank issued a warning to domestic exchanges, going so far as to state it would move to shutter startups that violated its guidance through the necessary government channels.  In statements provided to CoinDesk, Huobi indicated that the move was a proactive one that found the two exchanges seeking to ""promote bitcoin industry self-discipline"".  Update: This article has been updated to clarify that only OKCoin's OKCoin.cn platform is affected by the withdrawal freeze.

42399607,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjt95,1486643661,LinkedIn Killer? Bitcoin Upstart 21 Takes on Social With Email Play,"Cryptic bitcoin company 21 Inc has launched a paid email platform that seems far removed from its initial focus on hardware.  The move is yet another in a string of pivots by the firm. Since it revealed it had raised $116m in 2015 (accrued over multiple rounds), 21 has evolved its strategy several times.  Originally founded as a bitcoin mining company, it soon appointed a new CEO – Andreessen Horowitz partner Balaji Srinivasan – and announced plans to distribute bitcoin mining chips embedded in consumer and enterprise hardware devices. The chips, attached to a Raspberry Pi and called '21 Bitcoin Computers', started shipping in November 2015 and quickly developers began building applications for the device.  Then, in March 2016, the company launched its first proof-of-concept for a network of devices incentivized to monitor websites with bitcoin. Several months later, it launched a software package that allowed any connected device to join the 21 network, enabling capabilities that were once only available to those with a 21 Bitcoin Computer.  The new communications platform seems to be yet another evolution for 21 Inc, though Srinivasan said the company has been working on this idea for some time, pointing to an SMS version of the current product that was published in late 2015.  Further, the CEO said, the email platform still aligns with the company’s primary goal.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Allowing people to earn bitcoin by responding to emails and completing tasks achieves many of the same goals in that it may get millions of people their first exposure to digital currency.""  In the old SMS version, 21 Inc showed users how to set up a 21 Bitcoin Computer to allow them to receive paid text messages from anyone without revealing the recipient’s number. The new platform, which allows users to set their own rate, makes the service accessible for people even without the company’s hardware.  Rewarding the recipient  The new service – available via the website and a MacOS app – looks similar to LinkedIn's InMail (which Srinivasan said is the platform’s closest competitor). And some enthusiasts, including Craig Lauer, an angel investor and mentor to TechStars and EvoNexus, have even made it public that they'd rather use 21’s platform over LinkedIn.  That’s probably because, according to Srinivasan, the recipient gets paid instead of the social network giant. On LinkedIn, payments made to send email to people outside your network are taken by LinkedIn itself, but on 21's platform, the money goes straight to the recipient.  Most of it, anyway. When a user sends an email, 21 adds a 10% fee to transactions – for instance, sending an email to someone charging $1 means paying $1.10 total.  That small fee, though, has the potential to turn into big revenue for 21.  ""InMail is nevertheless estimated to be a $300m per year business for LinkedIn, and we think that market could expand if recipients can get paid,"" Srinivasan said.  Premium prices  This is especially true if well-known early adopters keep setting high prices (and people are prepared to pay for access to them).  Andreessen Horowitz's Ben Horowitz set his account at $100 via the service. With such high values, some wonder what the benefit of using bitcoin would be since, in these cases, it might be just as easy to add debit and credit payment options.  But Srinivasan contends there are several advantages.  ""It allows instant receipt of funds without linking a bank account, it works across borders and it can scale up and down to very small and large payments alike,"" he said.  This appreciation is also, it seems, why people have rushed to the new service, since users can make $2 in bitcoin just by reading through how the site works and setting up an account.  This mechanism for offering monetary value for tasks is the real mission of the 21 platform, according to Srinivasan.  ""The goal is to make it possible to send targeted tasks to people. In the same way that your resume qualifies you for an offline job, a verified 21 profile qualifies you for online tasks, payable in bitcoin,"" he said.  The Gerson Lehrman Group, an expert network that provides independent consulting services, offers a service like this, although it is aimed at survey participants, rewarding users with virtual event credits and monetary reimbursement.  ""Think of it like a hybrid of LinkedIn and Amazon Mechanical Turk,"" Srinivasan said.  Mixed reviews  John Light, head of product marketing at Abra, a bitcoin-based mobile app for remittances, suggested the paid email use case is merely a way to market the tasks platform.  ""The email application seems like a useful idea, especially for those getting a lot of inbound requests and they need to apply some filter to decide what’s worth responding to – especially if those people are outside your network,"" Light said. ""The messaging product is also useful because it’s public-facing … and acts as a marketing tool.""  Although others, like Wayne Vaughan, founder and CEO of Tierion, remain skeptical – not only of the paid inbox, but also of the tasks platform.  In today’s world, social signals such as getting introduced by a mutual friend are generally seen as more valuable than monetary compensation, Vaughan suggested.  ""Putting a price on that … it's like if I want to tell you something interesting, but you ask for $50 to do that, I want to tell you to go screw yourself,"" he said.  Not to mention, high prices put some people – such as young entrepreneurs or developers and small publication journalists – at a disadvantage.  ""It’s not a perfect solution,"" conceded Light, ""but it’s a new option for purely unsolicited messages with no pre-applied filter.""  Of course, there will always be other channels on which people can reach out, such as the public networks like Twitter. On these, though, account holders aren’t guaranteed to respond, and surely, said Light, they would if someone paid them to.  As an added incentive for some, the money received from incoming emails or earned from tasks can be donated to three different “tech-savvy and bitcoin-friendly” charities, said Srinivasan.  ""Because price is a signal, money could be a very interesting way to prioritize messages,"" he argued. ""At the same time, the recipients often don’t actually need the money, so donating it to a good cause is a creative solution.""  Exit play?  Yet, some like Vaughan are still doubtful.  All in all, Vaughan (and other observers) wonders if 21 isn’t trying to amass a large user base, a new asset so the company can sell.  ""If you’re trying to sell your company and show fast customer acquisition this might be a way to do it,"" he said.  But maybe it's more about finding a business model that gains traction, allowing 21 to drill down on a specific use case, Light argued.  While the move isn't necessarily a desperation play, Vaughan thinks 21's ability to raise money could be limited since its mining equipment business hasn't worked itself into a commercial success as of yet.  In Vaughan’s mind, this is the latest pivot that shows a company experimenting with revenue-generating business models.  He concluded:  ""If there’s a thread of continuity, then they need to do a better job of communicating what they’re all about.""

The post, issued via the central bank’s website, confirmed rumors that circulated yesterday suggesting that the new meetings were broader than ones held earlier in the month, including a number of lesser-known bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchanges.  Perhaps most notably, the PBOC indicated it has issued specific directives to the businesses, reiterating that the platforms must enforce anti-money laundering (AML) and foreign exchange regulations.  The central bank said:  ""If the exchanges violated the above requirements, and if the circumstances were serious, the inspection team may ask the relevant departments to close down the exchanges according to law.""  BTC Trade, Yunbi, HaoBTC, CHBTC, BTC100, BitBays, Yuanbao, Dahonghuo and Jubi were among the bitcoin exchange platforms in attendance, according to the statement.  The announcement comes weeks after the PBOC first met with China’s ‘Big Three’ bitcoin exchanges, BTCC, Huobi and OKCoin, earlier in the month, in which it issued similar guidance.  Soon after, all three exchanges moved to enact trading fees.  In statements, sources familiar with the meeting said exchanges have all largely agreed to limit margin trading and zero-fee trading in response to pressures from the central bank.  Others have hinted that the PBOC may have other motives for the announcement.  ""Somehow, they perceive the high price and the rising price as a threat,"" said one exchange executive speaking under condition of anonymity.  At least one exchange, BTC Trade, has issued a statement on its website today indicating that it would now impose similar fees as its competitors.

42399609,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjtA4,1486602761,3 Dead Cats And A Moon: A Guide to Bitcoin's Price Consolidation,"Willy Woo is an entrepreneur, angel investor, derivatives trader and cryptocurrency enthusiast.  In this guest feature, Woo takes a tongue-in-cheek look at bitcoin's historical market performance, ultimately proposing a bitcoin-specific macroscopic trading pattern he believes can predict the price.  Here at Woobull Labs, we take data driven analysis very seriously. Today, I'm pleased to present the culmination of four years of data gathering and analysis on bitcoin trader psychology.  The sketch above depicts the basic rig we used for our epic research.  The dataset includes readings over four years at 10 minute intervals (210,240 readings per subject). In total, we collected the psychological brainwave pattern of 100,000 of bitcoin traders – a staggering 210,240,000,000 data points – as they tapped away on their keyboards.  Yes, very epic.  After filtering the brainwaves for solely emotion signatures, we found a pattern emerged. There was a very predictable repeating fractal after each and every bitcoin 'mooning' (or peak).  Below is the emotional brainwave superposition of 100,000 traders.  Our scientists have privately coined this brainwave pattern ""Soobmee"" (Sudden Onset Of Bitcoin Mooning Exuberance).  Exhibits A-D were the strongest imprints we found in the dataset.  After many months of signal analysis, we were able to map this pattern to define a new and very important predictive trading pattern.  Unlike the tried-and-tested trader patterns such as the double top, head and shoulders, cup and handle, and not to mention the most revered in crypto-land… the wedge pattern… today we unveil to the world an all new bitcoin-specific macroscopic trading pattern… the three cats and a moon pattern.  (Yes seriously).  The long range bitcoin price chart below shows this fractal pattern at work:  A and B shows the pattern playing out in a bear trend, while C and D shows it playing out in a bull market.  They may look different, but they are actually the same, skewed onto a bullish or bearish trend line. The signalling to watch for is one cat and two kittens that follow on from a pump and dump.  Here's the pattern match below. We found that focusing your attention and listening for the meows of distressed kittens helps.
