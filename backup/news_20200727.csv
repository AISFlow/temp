In a press statement emailed to Coindesk, Revolut said customers will now be able to trade and hold XLM on its platform.   According to the statement, Stellar’s addition was in response to “overwhelming demand” from users. Revolut currently supports a total of six cryptocurrencies including bitcoin, ether, XRP and bitcoin cash.   Earlier this month, Revolut announced its customers in all U.S. states except Tennessee could buy, sell or hold bitcoin and ether on its platform. While Revolut had started operating in the U.S. in March, it then partnered with Paxos to gain regulatory permission required to offer crypto banking services.   “Adding Stellar and passing ownership of cryptocurrencies to our customers are the first in a series of steps we are taking to seriously overhaul our crypto product,” Ed Cooper, the company’s head of crypto, said in the statement.   In an email sent to its customers last month, Revolut said it would give users legal control over their cryptocurrencies starting July 27. Although the firm said it would cease to be the “legal owner” of the available cryptos, users would still be unable to transfer the funds outside of Revolut’s ecosystem.",POSITIVE,XLM | XRP,BCH | FIAT | REGULATION | XLM | XRP,Jaspreet Kalra,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/07/27/digital-bank-revolut-adds-stellar-to-list-of-supported-cryptocurrencies,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9a2941e160c9f959ff5619be4fdc0a9356b34358-1500x888.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $10,829 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 9.7% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $9,849-$10,964  BTC above 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bullish signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin hit $10,964 on spot exchange Coinbase Monday, a price level not seen since August 2019. “The bitcoin breakout seemed to finally have happened as we lifted off from $9,800,” said Jack Tan, of Taiwan-based quantitative trading firm Kronos Research. “The trend is clear and we are headed higher.”      Read More: Odds of Bitcoin Hitting Record High in 2020 Are (Slightly) Up      Bitcoin trading volume on Coinbase Monday was at $292 million. This was the highest since June 11, when volumes hit $255 million.      Traders have long discussed the $10,500 price range as a level to stay above to fuel a lengthy bull run, said Neil Van Huis, director of institutional trading at Chicago-based crypto liquidity provider Blockfills. “We need to stay over $10,500, so I would probably want to see a sharp interest in demand above that and to stay over it for more than 24 hours to see if the bullishness has legs,” Van Huis said.      Despite the excitement Monday, bitcoin’s jump might compel selling in the alternative cryptocurrency, or altcoin, market, said Kronos’ Tan. “Unfortunately, this might actually suck the energy out of the altcoins and high-flying DeFi tokens.”      One dynamic to watch: The ETH/BTC pair Monday is down 4% on Coinbase as traders are selling ether for bitcoin on the spot market.      Regardless of the rebalancing, Chris Thomas, head of digital assets for broker Swissquote, says DeFi is the main reason for the cryptocurrency markets’ move up overall. “It's purely DeFi driven,” said Chris Thomas. “We will likely see a lot more of this, resulting in ether driving higher and pulling everything else with it.”    Ethereum fees jump 550% in 2020    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Monday trading around $323 and climbing 5.6% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Read More: Ethereum Miners’ Income Soars by 60% in a Month      In January, the average fee on the Ethereum network was 0.000542 ETH. So far in July, average fees on Ethereum are at 0.003532 ETH, a 550% increase in the cost to conduct transactions on the second-largest blockchain by market cap, according to data aggregator Blockchair.      “The recent rise of ether’s price could be explained by the fact that large users and investors in the DeFi ecosystem are buying ETH now in order to pay less gas fees for each transaction,” said Jean-Baptiste Pavageau partner at Paris-based quant firm ExoAlpha.      Some traders may be taking advantage of this rise in fees, stockpiling ether as the situation may only exacerbate as 2020 continues. “Speculators are actively monitoring the DeFi ecosystem and are anticipating growth of the Ethereum network over the coming months, increasing the demand in ether to pay for the gas fee of each transaction,” added Pavageau.

42384173,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA1B5R,1595874536,How Millennials Are Shaping the Future of Money,"Matt Luongo is the CEO of Thesis, a cryptocurrency venture production studio. Thesis’ first two products are Fold, a consumer payment app, and Keep, a privacy layer for public blockchains. He’s also a contributor to tBTC, which lets bitcoin holders access DeFi on Ethereum.      Millennials are now the largest generation in the U.S. workforce. As we increasingly drive the world’s major economic, technological and social trends, millennials are beginning to reshape industries from entertainment to travel. It’s no surprise: From careers to fashion to music, millennials (now aged 24 to 39) are remaking the world in our own image.      A common thread in this millennial disruption is a desire for autonomy, self-sufficiency and personalization. Across the board, millennials are rejecting one-size-fits-all solutions in media, fashion, food and career choices. Studies show millennials are demanding a personalized, seamless experience from businesses and retailers. We expect personal treatment – and decision sharing – in our medical care, and we want the businesses and products we use to align with ideas and causes we support. Gone are the days of the company man; most millennials are happy to change jobs if they find an opportunity that offers room for personal growth.      See also: Generation Crypto      This desire for autonomy and granular choice extends into the world of finance. For most of the past hundred years, retail finance was dominated by a small number of regional, and later national, institutions. No more: 71% of millennials would change banks based on the quality of an app, and a full third of us say we won’t need a bank at all in the future.      Instead, we are looking for new forms of finance that we can tailor to our individual needs. We want products that give us, rather than brokers and middlemen, the ultimate say in how we handle our money. With governments and entire economies buckling under the stress of a global pandemic, we are demanding even more self-sufficiency in the financial sphere, and using revolutionary technologies such as cryptocurrencies to get it.    Millennial finance has more in store – and cryptocurrencies will be key.    Millennial finance is premised on the ability of new technologies to fundamentally and permanently reshape how the money system operates in both form and function. This isn’t just theory. It’s happening now, and millennials are leading the charge. The success of platforms like Robinhood, Acorns and Wealthfront demonstrates the potency of this movement and underscores millennials' thirst for options beyond the traditional banks and brokerage houses.      But these apps are only the tip of the iceberg. Their fundamental innovation is around user experience; they ultimately use the same financial infrastructure that legacy banks and wealth managers do. Millennial finance has more in store – and cryptocurrencies will be key. Rather than building a better train to run over the same old rails, crypto lets us build new, open, peer-to-peer rails.    No more middlemen    Our generation is the driving force behind a new financial system, based on crypto, that’s already cropping up and expanding in ways that will soon be impossible to ignore. Statistics bear this out: 18% of millennials have bitcoin, and 42% are planning to buy it in the next five years. Some have suggested crypto is already an important driver for growth for the entire fintech space.      Millennials’ gravitation toward crypto is not surprising. From our perspective, it can offer solutions to many of the shortcomings of traditional finance. This generation has extremely low levels of trust in institutions, including regulators and banks; cryptocurrency minimizes the need for trust. We are globalists; crypto crosses borders seamlessly. We reject the corruption and insider deals of older generations; code cannot be bribed.      Most important, crypto is built on a foundation of peer-to-peer self sufficiency. With nothing more than a wallet and a private key, we can have unlimited access to a growing universe of financial tools. Some of these parallel the functions of the traditional economy; others will no doubt create entirely new concepts around money and wealth. The space is still nascent, and crypto is a long way from displacing the J.P. Morgans of the world. Nonetheless, the past year has seen a surge in activity that indicates the future could be nearer than it seems.    We reject the corruption and insider deals of older generations; code cannot be bribed.    Millennials are using crypto to drive the growth of decentralized finance, or DeFi. Platforms including Maker DAO and Compound have gained significant traction in the past year by letting people earn interest on savings and take out loans through tools such as collateralized debt positions (CDPs). Crucially, access to such applications is decentralized and trustless, not controlled by middlemen.      Millennial finance is changing venture capital too. The success of Seedinvest and Republic shows millennials’ appetite to invest in privately held companies. And a truly novel concept – the decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO – is showing signs that it is ready for prime time taking flight on Ethereum The original DAO famously crashed and burned in 2016. But since then, DAOs have matured impressively and now have the potential to become the new venture firms, allowing people to join permissionlessly and get returns on their investments. Just last month OpenLaw launched the first “legal DAO” for distributed VC investments.      Millennials’ eagerness to disrupt finance prompted CNBC to declare that “fintech may be one of the few industries looking back fondly at what happened to Wall Street after 2008.” But this is just the beginning. Millennials, history’s first digital-native generation, are poised to drive epochal change with crypto-powered fintech in the form of decentralized finance. By combining real financial competence with technological innovation and a radically different view of how finance should work, we will reform the system from bottom to top.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | ETH | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Matt Luongo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/07/27/how-millennials-are-shaping-the-future-of-money,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0f0fa4dd8859faa9ca825a8097ac7b10148ce933-1700x1133.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bit.com said it wants to rival Deribit, the Panama-based exchange that constitutes 88% of market share, according to data site Skew.

Market intel    The Golden Context Bitcoin finally passed the $10,000 mark over the weekend. First Mover asks why this hadn’t happened sooner. In the past month, fears of stagflation have settled in due to the greenback’s devaluation and an underutilized labor market in the U.S. This has pushed gold’s prices – seen as a hedge against inflation – to all-time highs of $1,940 (passing the previous ceiling of $1,921 an ounce in 2011). Bitcoin, meanwhile, has been stuck in a narrow trading range since April and only recently passed the $10,000 threshold, approximately half of its 2017 all-time-high of $20,000. “Bitcoin has its own microeconomics very unique to crypto, including mining difficulty cycles, the changing regulatory environment and other factors that have little to do with inflation,” Richard Rosenblum, co-founder of GSR, said. Subscribe here to get First Mover directly in your inbox.      Mining Profits Ethereum miners’ daily income has soared over 60% in a month, according to Sparkpool. The profitability is tied to soaring transaction fees and relatively slow growth in competition from other miners. Daily income was around $1.85 per 100 megahashes second (MH/s) on the network on June 27, rising as high as $3.27 on July 25. This surge has outpaced ether’s (ETH) price jump of 40% over the same period.    Opinion    Crypto's Outthinking Fintech's Box Crypto is so much more than fintech. In the latest Crypto Long & Short newsletter, CoinDesk’s head of research, Noelle Acheson, argues fintech is a tired word to describe financial innovation. While crypto creates new pathways for moving money around and generating returns, it’s also a data innovation and an innovation of authority, leading to new and revised ideas of what money is and can be. “Given the impact of crypto-based innovation on our understanding and application of financial concepts, surely we can come up with something better.

Debt financing can be an attractive way to raise the funds needed to purchase equipment without diluting ownership through equity issuance. But the mining industry is volatile and loans generally carry high interest rates and strict collateral requirements, making it a double-edged sword for those that borrow to expand. Case in point: Canadian bitcoin miner Bitfarms.      CoinDesk Research presents an in-depth look into Bitfarms. With over 29,000 ASIC miners spread across five facilities, Bitfarms is one of Canada's largest bitcoin mining companies. Throughout 2019, the company quickly grew its overall hashrate, which was financed primarily through a $20 million loan from Dominion Capital. In this report, we examine Bitfarms' financial position and evaluate its ability to pay down debt coming due in 2021.      Some takeaways:    At its core, Bitfarms operates decent equipment at a respectable cost of electricity, resulting in positive operating cash flows.  However, the company used high-interest-rate debt with large balloon payments to expand operations. Now, with over $20 million in financial obligations coming due by the end of 2021 coupled with declining revenue output per terahash, Bitfarms may struggle to pay off its debt.

A list of covenants and restrictions from its loan, however, may hamper the company’s ability to raise capital through equity and debt, leaving Bitfarms with very few apparent options.

42384168,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA1Axt,1595864697,"Private Sector Could Bring Value to Future CBDC Launches, Says IMF Official","A director at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) thinks the private sector could bring value to the technology supporting central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), should they be adopted by nations.    Tobias Adrian, a financial counselor and director of the IMF's Monetary and Capital Markets Department, gave a keynote address last week at the “Building CBDC: A Race To Reality” conference, sponsored by blockchain software firm R3.  Adrian offered two models for the provision of a CBDC, varying in how they would pair the private sector with central banks.  The first model looked at synthetic CBDCs (sCBDC), which are backed by the liabilities of a central bank but issued with the aid of a private entity, such as a commercial bank.  Adrian noted the private sector should be left to deal with customer due diligence, wallet design and currency distribution, while the central bank would be in charge of regulation and supervision.  The second, ""two-tiered,"" model puts central banks in charge of the issuance of a CBDC and transaction settlement, with technology likely to be occasionally updated.  As such, the sCBDC model would spur private sector-led innovation at a more ""fundamental level,"" he said.  Such innovation ""could be extremely valuable, given the pace of technological change, and given many central banks’ limited experience in providing retail services,"" according to Adrian.  However, there are several potential challenges to central banks partnering with private firms, including interoperability, unfair competition and payment system stability.  Overall, Adrian said both models could offer an ""especially liquid and safe payment instrument.""  Adrian spoke at a time when central banks are more widely expressing a willingness to examine CBDCs, with the Bank of England, Bank of Japan and Sweden's Riksbank among those already exploring, if cautiously, the possibility of a future launch.  The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) is currently taking center stage with its two-tier model, and already has its digital yuan moving to testing with commercial enterprises.

42384180,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA1BGl,1595861498,Silvergate's Bitcoin-Backed Lending Product Grew 80% in the Last Quarter,"Silvergate Bank continued to add a steady drip of cryptocurrency customers in the second quarter and its portfolio of bitcoin-collateralized loans nearly doubled, dwarfing the growth of its traditional real estate loan book.      According to its latest earnings report, released Monday morning, the bank’s vanilla loans – about $1.1 billion of the type of assets George Bailey would have recognized – increased by only 0.1% from the first quarter. Bitcoin-collateralized loans through the bank’s SEN Leverage product surged 88% in the same period, to $22.5 million.      The bank continues to have a steady pipeline of more than 200 customers waiting to be onboarded, Silvergate CEO Alan Lane said on an earnings call Monday.      “It’s a great time to be a bitcoin banker,” Lane said. The publicly traded, La Jolla, Calif.-based bank is one of the few U.S. banks willing to openly serve crypto-related businesses and gets most of its deposits from the crypto sector.      Each of the SEN Leverage loans has performed according to the bank’s expectations, Lane said.      In response to analysts’ questions, Silvergate EVP of Corporate Development Ben Reynolds projected that SEN Leverage’s growth would be dominated by institutional customers taking out credit lines from anywhere between $1 million to $10 million. While Silvergate is tempering SEN Leverage growth by the speed at which it can safely underwrite the loans, the customer demand for the product, which is part of the Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN). is strong, Reynolds added.      Read more: Institutional Trading House ErisX Joins Silvergate Exchange Network      The bank went public on the New York Stock Exchange in November. With $2.34 billion in total assets, Silvergate is less than 1% the size of JPMorgan Chase.    Money makers    Despite outpacing growth in the bank’s traditional loan book, the bitcoin-collateralized loans have a long way to go before they affect the bank’s net interest income (NII), or profit from loans.      “If you assume 7% yield on the $22 million, it suggests less than 3% of NII as it stands today,” Mike Perito, a bank stock analyst at investment bank Keefe, Bruyette & Wood, said in an emailed statement.      The SEN Leverage product is used for many kinds of trading strategies, beyond just a long position, Reynolds said. Demand for bitcoin-backed loans tends to decrease as the market becomes less volatile.      The crypto space continues to be a rich source of non-interesting bearing deposits for the bank: $1.6 billion, or 94% of total deposits, comes from the sector.      While deposits decreased from calling outstanding brokered certificates of deposit (CDs) and from a decrease of deposits from digital currency customers, the latter category now makes up 90% of total deposits, up from 84% in the first quarter.      As a result, the bank’s cost of deposits dipped to 0.37%, from 0.87% in the first quarter. Crypto firms’ deposits are an attractive source of funding for Silvergate because they don’t pay interest, whereas brokered deposits are expensive because they need high rates to attract investors.      Read more: Banks in US Can Now Offer Crypto Custody Services, Regulator Says      The bank signed on 31 new crypto firms in the second quarter. Out of its digital currency client growth, 25 were new institutional investors, three were crypto exchanges (including ErisX), and another three were in the miscellaneous bucket. Deposits across all customer types decreased in the second quarter.      For the second half of 2020, Martino said he expects interest in the SEN from institutional investors to increase given bitcoin’s recent rise above $10,000, and does not expect to see Silvergate’s rivals continue to bid aggressively for deposit business in a zero-interest-rate environment.      Activity on the SEN increased by 28% since last quarter to more than 40,000 transactions, Lane said.      The volume running over the SEN increased by 29% quarter-over-quarter to $22.4 billion, a 160% increase from the same period last year.      Silvergate reaped $2.4 million in fee income from digital currency customers, a 41% increase from first quarter 2020 and the largest quarterly increase the bank has had so far from this revenue source. Silvergate CFO Antonio Martino noted the bank saw the highest volume of wire transfers ever as more crypto exchanges used the bank’s cash management products.    Crypto banking competition    Even with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) announcing that nationally chartered U.S. banks can now custody crypto, building out custody services for digital assets is different from building out custody products for the existing financial market, Lane added.      Even though the California Department of Business Oversight and the San Francisco Federal Reserve has been OK with banks safeguarding digital assets for some time, state-chartered Silvergate has no plans to jump into crypto custody anytime soon, the CEO said. In June, Silvergate partnered with crypto custodian Anchorage to custody assets for SEN Leverage customers.      While Silvergate hasn’t announced any crypto prime brokerage plans, it is focused on ways in which it can help reduce the friction on the digital asset side of trades as it’s done for the fiat side through the SEN, Reynolds said. The bank is considering building new products, forming new partnerships and even targeted acquisitions in the field of digital asset settlement.      Read more: Behind ‘Prime Broker’ Buzzword Lies a Complex Strategy Game for Crypto Firms      The most prime brokerage-esque product the bank is focused on now is offering lines of credit, Lane said.      “What prime brokerage means for the digital currency industry is still being developed,” he added.      In response to an analyst’s question about JPMorgan Chase banking Coinbase and Gemini, Lane said Silvergate had anticipated that competition would come into the space for some time.      “We know for a fact that our exchange partners desire to have multiple banking relationships,” he said. “As you can see from the results in the quarter, we didn’t see any direct impact from the [JPMorgan] announcement. We continue to grow.”      Update (July 27, 21:39 UTC): New information from Silvergate's earnings call has been added to the piece.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/07/27/silvergates-bitcoin-backed-lending-product-grew-80-in-the-last-quarter,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c576cec4d8a584255a455e6c6410d11a1f3788c0-1500x844.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The DOJ said last week an Ohio grand jury indicted three figures in the PlexCoin initial coin offering (ICO) on conspiracy to commit both securities and wire fraud, as well as money laundering and one count of wire fraud.  The DOJ alleges founder Dominic Lacroix, Yan Ouellet and Sabrina Paradis-Royer, from Quebec, Canada, made false statements including promising returns of over 1,345%.  PlexCoin raised a total of $15 million from investors in 2017; the SEC stopped the sale with an emergency asset freeze in December of that year.  Lacroix, Paradis-Royer and PlexCorp were all sued by the SEC for securities fraud in late 2017 and Lacroix had his assets frozen again in June 2018.  Last August, the defendants agreed to each pay $1 million in penalties and not participate in a securities sale again; PlexCorp would also disgorge $4.56 million plus $350,000 in interest to the SEC.  Lacroix served a two-month prison sentence in Canada for contempt of court in 2017.  If found guilty, the DOJ's indictment may well take PlexCoin's remaining ICO funds.

Bitcoin jumped above $10,300 on Sunday, breaching the resistance of a trendline falling from the December 2017 to June 2019 highs.  Following the bullish move, the options market now shows a 7% probability of bitcoin rising to the historical 2017 all-time high of $20,000 before year's end, according to data from crypto derivatives analytics firm Skew.  The number had dropped to 4% a week ago with short-term implied volatility, a gauge of the market's expectations for bitcoin's future volatility, falling to record lows.  ""Options market is repricing quickly the probability of [new highs] by the end of the year, from 4 to 7% over the last week,"" Skew CEO Emmanuel Goh told CoinDesk in a Telegram Chat.  However, the odds remain below 10%, meaning traders believe a rally to $20,000 is unlikely to happen this year.  That's because market participants ""as yet remain unconvinced that this short-term rise in volatility will extend into year-end,"" said Shaun Phoon, a trader at QCP Capital.  The one-month implied volatility metric – the market's expectation of how volatile bitcoin will be over the next 30 days – has risen from 48% to 64% with Sunday's price breakout.  However, longer-term price volatility expectations remain depressed.  Six-month implied volatility has registered a meager rise from 65% to 68% over the past three days and remains below the lifetime average of 76%.  Implied volatility has a positive impact on option probabilities: that is, when implied volatility rises, bitcoin is more likely to reach a certain level before a specific date.  Bitcoin's price is currently trading at $10,290, representing over 3% gains on the day.

Hbar spiked earlier this year when Google announced it will be joining Hedera’s governing council, which includes other high-profile multinational firms including Boeing, Avery Dennison, IBM and Tata Communications.  Earlier this year, Binance integrated Simplex into its platform to expand the range of fiat currencies users can use to purchase crypto.

42384171,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA1B4B,1595851699,Bitstamp Backs BCB’s SWIFT Alternative for Instant Cash-Crypto Settlements,"BCB Group, which provides payments services in Europe to institutional players such as Bitstamp, Coinbase, Galaxy and Kraken, is launching an instant settlement network for cash and crypto.      Announced Monday, the BCB Liquidity Interchange Network Consortium (BLINC) is a real-time gross settlement system that aims to do for euros, British pounds and Swiss francs what the likes of the Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN) does in the U.S. for big crypto clients transacting in U.S. dollars.      BLINC is now emerging from a pilot stage, going live with Luxembourg-based exchange Bitstamp as its founding partner alongside some 15 other BCB clients. More exchanges are expected to be added in the coming weeks.      “BLINC is a real-time, 24/7, fiat settlement network, made possible because the reach of BCB’s client network is now very wide in the U.K. and Europe,” said Oliver von Landsberg Sadie, CEO of BCB Group.      As a non-stop clearing and settlement ecosystem, BLINC members no longer need to use conventional payment schemes such as SWIFT and SEPA, the Single Euro Payments Area for the European Union, which can be slow moving and only operate during office hours.      Sophisticated crypto traders and market makers looking for arbitrage opportunities can be stymied because it takes a day to load their account with euros, said Landsberg Sadie. And while the U.K. has an efficient Faster Payments Scheme, it’s limited to payments of $250,000, which is quite small when it comes to institutional crypto, he said.      “If you're a market trader in crypto and need to settle half a million pounds quickly, you're stuck. If it's at night, or even during the day, you're not going to get that kind of instant settlement,” said Landsberg Sadie.      “BLINC is an appealing proposition for Bitstamp as it enables us to offer our clients a frictionless mechanism to fund their trading accounts,” said Chris Aruliah, VP of Banking relations, of Bitstamp in a statement. “The ability to move money instantly in the fast-moving crypto markets is crucial and gives our clients an edge when trading on the Bitstamp platform.”      BLINC is also integrated with a token issuance and settlement system called the Digital Asset Shared Ledger (DASL), built on top of R3’s public Corda Network by a team of ex-RBS blockchain coders known as LAB577.      Behind the scenes, BCB has a banking relationship in the U.K. with ClearBank, which also stepped in to take over banking for Coinbase when Barclays chose to end that relationship around this time last year.      Without naming names, Landsberg Sadie said BCB has a number of other partner banks in Europe and Switzerland.      The barriers stopping banks coming close to dealing in crypto are gradually being removed, with some regulatory clarity emerging last week in the form of a letter from Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) allowing nationally chartered banks in the U.S. to provide custody services for cryptocurrencies.      “I think it may take a little while for this to materialize,” said Landsberg Sadie, discussing the OCC’s letter, “but it’s very encouraging, particularly when paired with the news we saw a couple of months ago that JPMorgan would be providing banking services to some U.S. exchanges.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/07/27/bitstamp-backs-bcbs-swift-alternative-for-instant-cash-crypto-settlements,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/10f55596b47eaa22746b5645a11fd377953b6d4a-2560x1920.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384181,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA1BI1,1595850890,"First Mover: Bitcoin at Last Passes $10K, but Why Has It Struggled While Gold Shone?","Bitcoin has at last broken convincingly above the all-important $10,000 mark, but why has it struggled so much in recent months when gold has soared to an all-time high?      Earlier this year, digital-asset investors were aflutter over the trillions of dollars of central bank money injections in response to the coronavirus-induced global recession. The bet was the flood of liquidity would eventually lead to inflation, in turn driving up prices for both gold, historically seen as a hedge against currency debasement, and bitcoin, sometimes referred to as “digital gold” or “Gold 2.0” due to its scarce supply.      You’re reading First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      Yet, since the end of April, when the coronavirus-related market gyrations subsided, bitcoin has lagged behind gold, frustrating the cryptocurrency’s investment narrative.      Gold prices have surged during the period, last week topping the all-time closing high of $1,891.90 an ounce reached in 2011, and are now trading at a record intraday high of $1,940 per ounce. The previous lifetime high of $1,921 was reached in September 2011.      Bitcoin, meanwhile, has been stuck in a narrow trading range since April and only just last night clambered to $10,200, a level not far off half of its all-time-high of $20,000 reached in 2017.      According to a handful of investors and analysts interviewed by CoinDesk, bitcoin is far less mature than gold and thus may lack a credible history as an inflation hedge. So it’s struggled to draw hedging bids despite a recent uptick in inflation expectations.      “Bitcoin’s inflation sensitivity hasn’t been tested in the last 10 years as there hasn’t been a sustained rise in price pressures.” Charlie Morris, founder of the investment firm ByteTree Asset Management, said in an audio interview via WhatsApp.      It’s a shift in tone from a few months ago, when the bullish hype over bitcoin was so ubiquitous it crowded out any reservations about bitcoin’s limited trading history or market size. Suddenly, there’s no shortage of caveats to explain why bitcoin hasn't reflected the inflation expectations that seem to be buoying gold.      To add insult to injury, other corners of cryptocurrency markets are white-hot: ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency after bitcoin, has gained some 150% this year. Bitcoin is up 42% in 2020.      “Bitcoin has its own microeconomics very unique to crypto, including mining difficulty cycles, the changing regulatory environment and other factors that have little to do with inflation,” Richard Rosenblum, co-founder of GSR, told First Mover in a Telegram chat.      U.S. inflation expectations, as implied in the market for the U.S. 10-year breakeven inflation rate, have risen to 1.51%, the highest since February. They’ve climbed from 0.5% on March 19, as the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet expanded by more than $3 trillion.      Bitcoin initially rose alongside the uptick in inflation expectations. The move from $3,867 to $10,000 seen in the two months to mid-May was likely fueled by the bullish narrative surrounding the May 12 halving. Since then, the cryptocurrency was locked in the range of $9,000 to $10,000 up until July 26, while inflation expectations continued to rise.      Gold, however, has drawn a consistent bid over the past four months, given its long history of serving as an inflation hedge, according to Joseph Trevisani, an analyst at FXStreet and former proprietary trader at Credit Suisse.      The yellow metal rose by an average 15% in real or inflation adjusted terms in the eight years between 1974 to 2008 when annual U.S. inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, was above 5%, according to the Journal of Wealth Management. Gold more than doubled to about $1,920 from $850 in the three years following the mid-2008 crash, as the Fed’s emergency liquidity injections pushed inflation expectations higher.      “Gold’s history as an inflation hedge is well known,” Trevisani told First Mover in a Slack chat. “Gold is a long-standing hedge against catastrophe. Bitcoin is not, or at least it is unproven.”      Indeed, bitcoin’s entire existence, since it was launched in early 2009, has taken place in a low inflation environment. The 10-year breakeven inflation rate fell from 1.6% to -0.62% in the two years through 2013, and it remained stuck in a range between 0% and 0.8% from 2014 to January 2020. That’s well below the Fed’s 2% target for annual inflation.      The gold market, at around $10 trillion, has sufficient depth and liquidity to absorb large hedging-related or haven inflows. Bitcoin’s market capitalization is comparatively paltry, at $189 billion.      ""Gold is like a tanker, while bitcoin is much more like a speedboat,” Gavin Smith, CEO of the cryptocurrency hedge fund Panxora, told First Mover in a telephone interview. “However, looking out three to five years, you’ll see the trajectory of both, and you’ll say both were an inflation play.”      Another factor stopping institutions and other traditional investors from making big portfolio allocations to bitcoin is a belief that its price action and network fundamentals aren’t as intimately connected as gold to the fate of the global economy.      “Bitcoin is interesting but I think that it tells us little about anything in the real world,"" Marc Chandler, a former chief currency strategist for the giant British bank HSBC, told First Mover in a LinkedIn chat.      Central banks, which don’t invest in bitcoin, often buy gold in times of stress, and they were net buyers during the virus-stricken first quarter, according to the data source Gold Hub.      “Nothing is up quite as much as gold,” Mati Greenspan, founder of the cryptocurrency and foreign-exchange analysis firm Quantum Economics, wrote Friday in an email to subscribers. “The absence of a major bitcoin rally is also a bit puzzling, especially as one of the leading narratives for the current action in gold is the lack of confidence in central banks. Possibly it will join in later on. I guess we'll see.”      After bitcoin's rise on Sunday, only time will tell if that process has just started.    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    BTC: Price: $10,241 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $10,334 | 24-Hr Low: $9,829      Trend: Bitcoin may be on the cusp of major bull run, having cleared a major resistance at the weekend, according to one analyst.      The cryptocurrency jumped over 8% in the seven days to July 26, violating a trendline connecting the December 2017 and July 2019 highs. ""This could be the real deal, we could be on the first serious step towards a bull run of epic magnitude,"" popular analyst Lark Davis tweeted early on Monday.      Some traders are now betting on a move to $20,000 over the next four months. Indeed, the breakout above the 2.5-year-long falling trendline is a major bullish development. However, BTC is yet to cross above resistance at $10,400 – a horizontal resistance line drawn linking the February and June highs.      The cryptocurrency has failed multiple times to keep gains above $10,000 over the last 12 months. As such, the bulls would be better off observing caution as long as prices are held below $10,400.      A break above that level, if confirmed, would open the doors to $11,000. On the other hand, a failure to establish a strong foothold above $10,000 could invite stronger selling pressure.      At press time, bitcoin is changing hands near $10,241, representing a 3% gain on the day.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/07/27/first-mover-bitcoin-at-last-passes-10k-but-why-has-it-struggled-while-gold-shone,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e57d15ceb42ad282c948192c8ccb96e5d842daf9-1900x1268.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Dubbed Serum, the initiative claims to offer a scalable and liquid decentralized exchange (DEX) for derivatives, solving some of the structural vulnerabilities and limitations in the existing DeFi space.  Solana is said to be able to process 50,000 transactions per second, compared to Ethereum, which can currently handle 15.  Being highly scalable means Serum can run an order book on-chain, improving the exchange's liquidity, according to the white paper.  Serum will be fully interoperable with Ethereum so it can tap into the existing DeFi space, which saw its market cap break the $4 billion boundary over the weekend.  The exchange will also offer a bitcoin proxy token, allowing users to trade the largest cryptocurrency's value on the Solana blockchain.  Other projects like Kin, which started out on Ethereum, have looked at migrating over to Solana because of the better scaling potential.  Since Saturday, the price of Solana's native ""SOL"" token has almost doubled from $0.99 to $1.90, according to CoinGecko.  Parallel to Serum, FTX announced it had listed SOL on its centralized exchange.  An FTX spokesperson told CoinDesk it'll be the users who decide the products traded on Serum.

MakerDAO, which is also the sector's largest protocol by a margin of $271 million locked in, crossed above $1 billion at around 18:00 UTC on Sunday, according to analytics aggregator DeFi Pulse.  The milestone, which represents how much money has been committed and not earned, demonstrates a rising interest in MakerDao and DeFi projects alike.  Collateral, locked up in the form of ether (ETH) or basic attention token (BAT), is used on Maker's protocol to undertake lending and generate DAI as debt against collateral.  Saying the news marked a ""big day"" for MakerDAO, David Freuden, co-author of ""DAO: A Decentralized Governance Layer for the Internet of Value,"" told CoinDesk that innovation in DeFi will increasingly challenge the premise of centralized finance.  Maker's dominance over other projects in the sector stands at 27.1%, with the highly valued Compound protocol coming in second place at around $729 million total value locked up.  The DeFi industry has seen a significant rise in total value locked up with the sector's $1 billion milestone in all protocols having been surpassed on Feb. 7, now up by more than $3.3 billion at time of writing.

Craig DeWitt, the blockchain payment infrastructure firm's director of product, made the announcement via Twitter on Sunday claiming ""anyone can use it"" to purchase physical goods online using the XRP cryptocurrency.  Payburner, a personal project of Dewitt's, is a non-custodial XRP wallet designed to operate as a plug-in within the Chrome and Brave web browsers.  DeWitt told CoinDesk in direct messages the plug-in is an example of a ""growing XRP ecosystem"" that leverages Xpring.  Xpring is a Ripple project that provides tools and funding for developers and startups working with XRP.  Payburner, currently in beta release, allows users to send and receive payments worldwide and instantaneously, Dewitt said.  The beta version builds on an earlier Payburner plug-in by integrating PayID, an identifier for payments used by entities such as banks.  Payment requests with encrypted peer-to-peer (P2P) messaging and PayID network searches are some of the new features in the beta release.  DeWitt said Payburner is expected to make a profit by charging a 1% merchant fee on XRP e-commerce sales.

42384177,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA1BAT,1595838748,Ethereum Miners' Income Soars by 60% in a Month and Outruns Ether's Price Jump,"The daily income earned by Ethereum miners has soared by over 60% in a month, according to data tracked by Ethereum mining pool Sparkpool.      The surge in daily profit from Ethereum mining surge has also outpaced ether's (ETH) price jump of 40% over the same period.      The profitability rise comes thanks to soaring transaction fees on the network, as well as relatively slow growth in competition from other miners.      Sparkpool's data shows Ethereum miners' daily income was around $1.85 per 100 megahashes second (MH/s) on the network on June 27. Over the past month, and the last two weeks in particular, this has jumped by 60% and reached as high as $3.27 on July 25. The metric has since dropped back to around $3.      During the same period, ether's price has gone up by nearly 40%, from $229 on June 27 to $327 at time of writing, the highest price point for over a year.      Transaction fees on the network, which form part of a miner's daily revenue, have reached a two-year high as the hype around decentralized finance (DeFi) brought a spike in network activities.      However, the total computing power competing on the world's second largest blockchain network by market capitalization has remained steady around 190 petahashes per second, blockchain explorer Etherscan shows.      Read more: DeFi Hype Has Sent Ethereum Fees Soaring to 2-Year High: Coin Metrics      In fact, data from Bitinfocharts indicates daily mining revenue on Ethereum had remained below $2 per 100 MH/s during the first quarter of the year and dropped to $1 per 100 MH/s following the crypto market crash on March 12. But in the four months since, daily mining revenue has tripled.      Currently, some state-of-art Ethereum mining equipment, such as InnoSilicon's A10 Pro with a computing power of 485 megahashes per second (MH/s), can generate $12.92 in daily revenue at Ethereum's current price and mining difficulty.      With an electricity of cost of $0.03 per kilowatt-hour (kWh), one A10 Pro machine is able to bring home a daily net profit of nearly $12, according to mining pool F2Pool's miner profitability tracker.      Profit at that level exceeds some top-of-the-line Bitcoin miners by almost 100%, although bitcoin's price has jumped above $10,000 over the weekend for the first time since early June. The sudden increase came after weeks of low price volatility that kept the cryptocurrency stuck between $9,000 and $9,500.      However, Bitcoin's mining difficulty is still around its all-time-high. As such, even the most efficient Bitcoin miners, like MicroBT's WhatsMiner M30S++ and Bitmain's AntMiner S19 Pro, are generating a daily revenue of $9 per unit.      At an electricity cost of $0.03 per kWh, that would provide a daily profit of around $6.50 at bitcoin's current price and difficulty, data from mining pool PoolIn shows. In general, industrial electricity cost for crypto mining can range between $0.03 to $0.06 per kWh.",POSITIVE,ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MINING | TRADING,Wolfie Zhao,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/07/27/ethereum-miners-income-soars-by-60-in-a-month-and-outruns-ethers-price-jump,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/893abd9608480518a5943cadf1418183e440ce53-1400x815.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Silvia Attanasio, head of innovation at the Italian Banking Association (Associazione Bancaria Italiana or ABI), said both the process of interbank reconciliation and the technology underlying the exchange of data had to change.      In the old system, reconciliation took a long time and was unpredictable. The average time for reconciliation was between 30 and 50 days, Attanasio said. On Corda, reconciliation is completed within a day.      The Interbank Agreement, a part of Italian law that governs interbank transfers, was passed in 1978 and describes a process of banks sending physical tapes. Once the interbank agreement was updated in May 2019 to include data standardization, Italy set a window between March 1 and Oct. 1, 2020, for integration to that standard and a blockchain banks could use to follow the new rules.      Read more: Italian Bank Consortium Trials Interbank Transfers on R3’s Corda      Information technology company NTT Data designed the network and bank technology company SIA operates it.      The project is in phase two with around 85% of Italian banks, or 55 banks total, using the platform to share interbank transfer data. In the third and final phase slated for October, the association expects to have 70 to 100 banks on the platform.      “The benefit is related to the new standardization more than the technology itself,” Attanasio said. “It’s like the rhythm you set on your metronome that sets a [faster] timeline.”    Blockchain benefits    Before Spunta, each bank had its own software for exchanging data related to interbank transfers, said Demetrio Migliorati, head of blockchain at Banca Mediolanum.      Using Corda for data exchanges between banks was also lower-stakes than moving fiat between banks on a blockchain.      “If we failed in this process, the worst thing that could happen was to have a problem in the information exchange between banks,” Attanasio said. “Clients are not affected, the companies are not affected. It was a natural sandbox.”      Read more: Italian Banks Are Ready to Trial a Digital Euro      The association did consider a centralized database as opposed to Corda but wasn’t open to having banks keep data on separate ledgers at each bank.      Experimenting with something small like data exchange between banks also allows Italian banks to experiment with other use cases. Some banks have begun experimenting with sharing know-your-customer (KYC) information and guarantees of credit on Spunta.      “If we want to do something new for Spunta, we change it immediately and it is changed for all banks,” said Migliorati.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/07/27/85-of-italian-banks-are-exchanging-interbank-transfer-data-on-corda,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ecdd1db633d762fd58cc7b83666f5b921c5ac4ed-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384182,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA1BFV,1595818844,Ethereum as Lifestyle Brand: What Unicorns and Rainbows Are Really About,"The lights were dimmed during the last day of Devcon in October 2019. A hush fell over the auditorium in Osaka, Japan. A haunting melody rippled through the crowd of roughly 1,000 people. Everyone knew the dance was about to begin.      Ethereum leaders, such as Hudson Jameson and Aya Miyaguchi of the Ethereum Foundation, would lead a goofy dance to close out the annual tech conference.      Cheers erupted when the Ethereum influencers took the stage, nodding respectfully to conference organizers and thanking the crowd. Soon the whole crowd was following along, jumping up and down, turning in circles. Critics might say they were simply mimicking the technologists on stage, but on the ground, people were adding their own moves or simply nodding along. Every Etherean dances his or her own way, or smiles and sways timidly. (Ethereum Foundation developer Vlad Zamfir, for example, dislikes the dance and said he prefers not to partake.)      The tongue-in-cheek ritual offers a microcosm of the carefree Ethereum lifestyle brand, inspired by the cryptocurrency founded in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin and others. Over the past five years, Ethereum, the blockchain platform that birthed so many ill-fated ideas, also launched a crop of products and services that are currently multibillion-dollar endeavors.      The dance is a promise “until next year,” the leaders say on stage. It’s a celebration of what the community has achieved so far and what it will achieve. The dance is a way to communicate with Ethereans from all around the world, even if they don’t speak English.      There is roughly $3.7 billion worth of cryptocurrency locked up in Ethereum-based decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms used by people around the world like Gerald Nash, a computer science student who interned at Coinbase and leads programs at the Howard University Blockchain Lab.      “I wouldn’t consider it a hard money because of the economic decisions the core team makes,” Nash said, describing the difference between bitcoin and ether. Bitcoin is digital money, he said, unlike ether.      “But I am fascinated by the other technological aspects [beyond money], like Turing-complete smart contracts,” he added.      As a young Black man, Nash said he uses DeFi to access “more complex or sophisticated finance [tools],” than he previously could through banks. He acknowledges these are risky software projects and uses them with deliberate caution. That hasn’t damped the allure.    Scaling diversity    Ethereum was able to outgrow the pop culture affiliations of its predecessor, Bitcoin, and develop a distinct culture where more people feel welcome to participate.      Law professor and Maker Foundation board member Tonya Evans offers another example of a DeFi fan.      “I’m a Black, queer woman in crypto … focused on education and financial inclusion,” she said. “You don’t have to come from a technical background to have a lot to add.”      From her perspective, cryptocurrency projects should “start off with some level of control then work toward decentralization.” She added this may not be the Bitcoin approach, often referred to cheekily as “Satoshi’s Vision.” Although different, she said, Ethereum represents a “good-faith march” toward a similar goal.      “These platforms and protocols aren’t developed in a vacuum, especially those developed for heavily regulated industries like finance and healthcare,” she said, describing Ethereum experiments. “It’s not about a foundation or any one person.”      Indeed, the DeFi industry attracted some of the shrewdest women in the blockchain industry, from Evans to Volt Capital co-founder Soona Amhaz and Optimism co-founder Jinglan Wang. None of these women danced with developers in Japan in 2019. But they may engage with the Ethereum lifestyle brand in other ways, like wearing unicorn swag.    Ethereum chic    It’s impossible to mistake an Ethereum event, which may include dancing or goofy rap performances (like the one at EDCON 2019 in Australia), in addition to unicorn graphics and rainbow or pastel-colored decor.      Attendees often dress with more pizazz than other tech conferences and may be openly inclined to use recreational drugs.      “Like many digital countercultural movements, who have always been anchored in a bohemian and hippie-like ethos, Ethereum is no exception,” said anthropologist Ann Brody, a crypto fan in attendance in Japan during the fifth Devcon.      She compared Ethereum to thought leader Stewart Brand and his Bay Area circles of influence in the 1960s and 1970s. However, the contemporary band of Ethereum thought leaders isn’t yet a “social movement,” Brody said.      “There are also those in the community that treat Ethereum simply as an experiment and that’s why I hesitate to call them a social movement at this time,” Brody said. “I think the dancing in itself speaks so much about Ethereum’s cultural values related to freedom, creative expression, fun, unconventionality, and even the desire for collective unity to some extent.”    TikTok commonalities    After all, the younger generation has a different relationship with brands than those who grew up before social media was omnipresent.      As the New York Times reported, it’s a popular pastime for teenagers to impersonate brands on platforms like TikTok and act out fictional storylines that often include dance moves. Likewise, Ethereans identify themselves with the Ethereum lifestyle brand, acting out the meme of a socially awkward nerd in the form of interpretive dance.      TikTok and Ethereum influencers can motivate thousands of people to download an app, sometimes garnering thousands of dollars in the process.      Ethereum has spawned many subcultures, comparable to how Twitter became a jungle of amorphous social groups like Weird Twitter and Bitcoin Twitter. Yet, even Ethereans who never attended a conference use the same iconography, the ether symbol or pink-haired unicorn, often illustrated with rainbows. This visual aesthetic sets it apart from the (generally older or more academic) Bitcoin community.      On the other hand, one tendency crypto fans, Bitcoiners and Ethereans alike, share with teens on TikTok is the preoccupation with identifying “posers” who don’t belong to Elite TikTok or to a chosen crypto “revolution.”      At their core, TikTok, Twitter and Bitcoin are platforms. Ethereum’s tech platform cannot handle comparable volumes yet, but the Ethereum community is motivated to achieve that goal and maybe even become tech unicorns.      “There is something naïve and childlike to these symbols,” Brody said of the “uncorrupted youth” aesthetics in Ethereum. She added that, to some people, the rainbow “world computer” is subconsciously a metaphor for global unification.    Unicorns    Many people believe they can use the wizardry (Ethereans love magical metaphors) of software to fix the failures of previous generations.      “Ethereum is a wonderland, a confusing wonderland for abstractions,” said the Ethereum Foundation’s Zamfir. “It represented a super ambitious decentralization agenda that was very general and took Bitcoin’s ethos to the next level. It was never just about finance.”      Camila Russo, founder of the Ethereum-centric newsletter The Defiant, said token creator Fabian Vogelsteller used cartoon unicorns in his videos, similar to the small unicorn and rainbow featured on early Devcon conference shirts and decorations, long before the token boom in 2017. Plus, “unicorn” has long been slang for a tech company evaluated at $1 billion. The aspirational unicorn metaphor was already common among young developers. Then, when Buterin was photographed in 2017 wearing unicorn shirts at tech events, Russo said the trend “blew up.”      “This is all in the context of the ETH community being young, millennial developers, where all these internet memes and unicorn images are already popular,"" she added.      Years later, the Ethereum Foundation and the Brooklyn-based conglomerate ConsenSys, headed by Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin, are still busy evangelizing their blockchain. While Lubin’s companies run a considerable chunk of the infrastructure supporting the DeFi ecosystem, Buterin’s nonprofit donates ether to organizations like the United Nations Children's Fund. Both companies sponsor a variety of grants and scholarships, and they are rarely short on unicorn swag.      Most of the dozen or so Ethereum co-founders pivoted to their own projects long ago. Those that remain, like Buterin and Lubin, remain consistent.    Vision    One common gripe among Ethereum critics, that the project keeps changing focus, doesn’t hold up if we consider the community’s goal rather than its tools.      Longtime Bitcoin advocate Bruce Fenton said he met Buterin at a conference in Miami back when Ethereum co-founders were just starting to crystalize their idea. In the years to come, Fenton said Lubin’s ConsenSys sponsored many “fun and relaxed” events with unicorn art and hip vendors. He said “hacker commune-style spaces” popped up from Zug to San Francisco, all revolving around similar aesthetics and values.      “I’ve always loved the energy at Ethereum events – lots of excited builders,” Fenton said. “What this ultimately means is democratizing finance. … They don’t need to go beg the establishment for money, they can go directly to the people.”      Token Summit co-founder William Mougayar, author of the “Business of Blockchain,” said the project’s 2020 “brand strategy” is still similar to conversations he had with Ethereum co-founders in 2014.      According to Mougayar’s consultation documents from 2014, the project aimed to be “inclusive,” “empowering” and “visionary” in order to “bring people together from all disciplines for the common goal of something bigger than themselves.”      The Ethereum community has generally followed these principles across a variety of software experiments over the past five years.    Roots    Millennials didn’t invent this moralistic and social approach to technology, as historian Benjamin Peters showed in his writings about Soviet tech culture. The Russian-Canadian Buterin said in public interviews he was interested in both socialism and libertarianism, offering a unique cultural mix. Ethereans, including fans of all backgrounds, are now putting their own spins on blockchain technology.      MyEtherWallet co-founder Kosala Hemachandra, who has been involved with the token economy since 2015, now spearheads a team of 18 employees. Last month the mobile app alone served at least 326,000 monthly active users, according to MyEtherWallet site data shared with CoinDesk. The website logged 1.7 million visitors.      “Volumes went up nine times since the start of the COVID-19 crisis, starting in February, compared to previous months,” Hemachandra said. “We have way more help requests now than before [2017], which means new users are coming in.”      Bitcoin purists who claim Ethereum is failing aren’t measuring success the same way as Ethereans. Hemachandra said he is confident Eth 2.0, the blockchain’s latest technical overhaul, will launch a usable beacon chain in 2020. Regardless of the current state of the software, Ethereum fans see the experiment as a success. It inspired research and community-building efforts that changed thousands of lives, for better or worse.      ConsenSys alum Andrew Keys said he met Lubin in 2014 and was instrumental in helping create Ethereum’s first cooperation with Microsoft in 2015. In May 2020, he described Ethereum as a “huge success” in its “opening act.”      “It has proven the ability to digitize all assets, automate agreements and empower self-sovereign identity,” Keys said. “We’re still in the first inning, though, and bleeding-edge technology that already garners billions in value takes time to upgrade properly.”    Global reach    Even Ethereum’s critics can’t deny the lifestyle brand went global in 2017.      In addition to dozens of central bank experiments, Ethereum also inspired grassroots education initiatives that draw more emotional nourishment from the founders than financial incentives.      Awosika Israel Ayodeji, an Ethereum advocate in Nigeria since the token boom of 2017, said he’s helped train 150 local developers on how to write Ethereum smart contracts since October 2019. After having an “amazing experience” at the EthCC 3 conference in Europe in March 2020, he returned home feeling confident in his work and supported by the global community.      While Bitcoiners are often individualistic, Ethereans tend to be more collectivist. For Ayodeji, Ethereum is more than a software or even a project. It is a way of thinking.      “The fact that Ethereum allows everyone an [opportunity for] expression is why I personally like Ethereum,” he said. “The image I see of Ethereum is an innovation giving power to groups of people to express and govern themselves.”      Like Evans and Nash, Ayodeji is a token user, including the dai stablecoins minted on MakerDAO.      “I earn in ETH and convert to fiat when I need to spend,” he said. “Ethereum culture for me is decentralization. Although we might still be far from decentralization, as it might still be early, it's gradually coming along.”      At least in terms of geographic decentralization, the Ethereum community has achieved some degree of diversity. Over in Taiwan, marketing associate Yahsin Huang has been involved with a local Ethereum meetup group since 2016.      “I'm interested in building the next generation of the internet,” she said. For her, getting involved in blockchain projects is “less about investment or career development” and closer to activism.      “I'm more of an idealist, very purpose-driven, believe in the core values, and also strongly believe in the future of the web,” she said.      Likeminded Ethereum Foundation developer Danny Ryan said that from his perspective “Ethereum is about freedom of choice on the internet.” He added Hemachandra is correct to believe the Eth 2.0 beacon chain will go live this year.      “I’m deeply concerned about the trajectory of technology. … Ethereum might help us disrupt that and push it in the right direction,” Ryan said. “The beacon chain is the core of this new consensus mechanism.”      His coworker Zamfir said Ethereum is also “associated with” a type of discipline or practice beyond coding. Zamfir doesn’t dance, like some of his fellow Ethereans, but even he can’t deny the narrative-shaping power of the moment at Devcon when the lights turned low.      “I still believe that Ethereum, Bitcoin and the blockchain space create an incredible opportunity to do interesting research,” Zamfir said. “I’m more optimistic than ever about what it could be, despite not being optimistic about what it is now.”",POSITIVE,ETH,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | TECHNOLOGY,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/07/27/ethereum-as-lifestyle-brand-what-unicorns-and-rainbows-are-really-about,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/50ea5aa9a8b8d0f69f9966f462b0de3d50dd57b5-1400x1050.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404889,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdlThs,1595808938,Crypto Long & Short: Where Fintech Ends and Crypto Begins,"An interesting op-ed by Leah Callon-Butler in CoinDesk this week got me to change my mind about something pretty fundamental.      She asked: “Is crypto fintech?”      My instinctive answer was “no!” For me, fintech is technology applied to finance, while cryptocurrency is a technology unto itself. That technology is giving rise to a new type of finance.      You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, a newsletter that looks closely at the forces driving cryptocurrency markets. Authored by CoinDesk’s head of research, Noelle Acheson, it goes out every Sunday and offers a recap of the week – with insights and analysis – from a professional investor’s point of view. You can subscribe here.      But something about that rationale felt a bit glib, so I wrestled with it some more. And then some more. And after way too long staring at the screen and wrinkling my forehead, I may be taking tentative steps into the “yes” camp, but with some heavy caveats.    What is 'fintech'?    To start, let’s look closer at what we mean by “fintech.”      The term is the portmanteau of “financial” and “technology,” and most definitions stress the latter's influence on finance. “Finance” is usually defined as “the management of money.”      Does crypto help with the management of money? Although they may have money-like qualities, cryptocurrencies are not yet generally recognized as such* as they are not widely accepted as a medium of exchange. Yet, they can help move money around, allow it to express opinions in new forms and generate returns in creative ways.    Of all the definitions of fintech from official organizations that I’ve read, the Financial Stability Board’s choice of wordshttps://www.fsb.org/work-of-the-fsb/policy-development/additional-policy-areas/monitoring-of-fintech/ is perhaps the most inclusive: “Technologically enabled financial innovation that could result in new business models, applications, processes or products with an associated material effect on financial markets and institutions and the provision of financial services.”    New business models. Check. New applications and processes. Check. Associated material effect on financial markets and institutions. Double check.      The “technologically enabled financial innovation” part is perhaps problematic, as crypto is about so much more than “financial innovation,” but it’s not wrong.    What is 'crypto'?    We should probably define “crypto” as well. The term originates with cryptography, which has to do with the security of information, and is widely used in its abbreviated form to refer to all things blockchain, including cryptocurrencies, tokens, smart contracts, etc.      Most of these concepts are being adopted by the financial world to try to re-imagine how securities move, how companies can raise funds, and even how currencies function.      This past week Standard Chartered, about as “traditional finance” as you can get (its origins go back to 1853), announced the pending launch of a crypto custody service. More details are emerging on the plans of PayPal, long a darling of the fintech sector, to offer crypto services. MUFG, Japan’s largest banking firm, is developing its own crypto token for use in a smartphone payment app.  In his timely report for crypto API provider Zabo called “Fintech Adoption of Cryptocurrency,” Alex Treece highlights how the rolling out of crypto-asset services boosted valuations of fintech firms Robinhood, Revolut and Square. Visa issued a statement this week in which it bragged that it was “reshaping how money moves across the globe,” and in the very next sentence talked about the “exciting avenue” of digital currencies.      So, fintech seems to be increasingly embracing crypto. But is crypto fintech? It does seem to be becoming part of the fintech set. It is a technology impacting how finance is handled. So, in some ways it is – but it’s also more than that.    Time for a refresh?    We should note that the term “fintech” is trying to put an edgy spin on an age-old concept. Financial innovation is not new, as material changes to how money is managed were triggered by the telegraph, telephone, centralized ticker service, complex derivatives and more.      Even in its modern application, it is becoming outdated because there are few traditional finance firms that don’t already heavily rely on new technologies to reach and grow client bases.      Given the impact of crypto-based innovation on our understanding and application of financial concepts, surely we can come up with something better. Using a tired catch-all for something so significant is like trying to put a formidable force into a tidy bucket.      So far, the technologies making the biggest waves in fintech are the internet and AI – they are game changing, for sure, but their innovation stems from the creation and treatment of radically new types of data.      Crypto is also a data innovation, but it goes much further – it’s an innovation of authority. And since the power of finance stems from the authority conferred to it and by it, the potential impact of crypto goes beyond what previous technologies have managed to achieve.      The technologies we apply to finance matter, as technology shapes what we do and how we do it. The internet, for instance, changed how we carry out age-old activities such as writing letters or grocery shopping. It also gave rise to entirely new activities such as video conferencing and fighting zombies (at least I think that’s new).      Fintech has been a transformative force; changing financial habits and attracting new audiences is no small feat. Crypto should be thrilled that it is being thought of as a tool that could join mainstream financial innovation. Yet it is not going to settle for just that.      The impact of new technologies on how we handle money should not be underestimated. But no technology until now has attempted to change our understanding of money.      (*As I'm writing this, it has just been revealed that bitcoin is now considered money in the context of money transmission licensing, only in Washington D.C.)    Anyone know what's going on yet?    This week in markets had both good news and bad.      On the good news, they say times of crisis bring people closer together. The European rescue package was seen as a step toward greater fiscal unity, and has boosted investor sentiment in European markets and in the euro.      And, at time of writing, S&P 500 year-to-date returns are now in positive territory, which is astonishing. Easy money is obviously a more powerful market driver than high unemployment, geopolitical tensions and uncertain growth.      The dollar, on the other hand, is trending weaker against most major currencies, and looks headed toward its worst month since early 2018. The COVID-19 case tally continues to go from bad to worse, China-U.S. relations have hit a new low and the likelihood that the global economy might not bounce back after all seems to finally be sinking in.      Bitcoin seems to finally be moving out of its doldrums, rising over the weekend to reach a gain of almost 10% on the week. Could this be the reawakening of crypto animal spirits?    CHAIN LINKS    This news is potentially a very big deal: The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) said in a public letter that any national bank can now custody digital assets for its clients.    Until now, custody has been the province of specialist firms, which typically needed a state license, such as a trust charter, to offer the service to institutional investors. Now, large, regulated financial companies that already provide similar safekeeping services for stock certificates and the like could broaden their service.  Many institutional investors are probably more likely to use a custodian they are already familiar with and who has a line to federal dollars, a better-capitalized balance sheet and bankruptcy rules that protect customer assets.  Caitlin Long points out there is still legal uncertainty for banks transacting with crypto assets in the U.S., because commercial law treatment of many crypto assets is still unclear.  She also explains why a bank license totally trumps a trust charter and New York’s BitLicense when it comes to crypto custody, and that existing custodians are going to have to merge with banks to stay competitive.  Also, it is probably more efficient for banks to buy the technology and expertise than try to build it from scratch.  It is not clear whether banks will be allowed to extend their custody services to cover the rapidly growing demand for staking, in which digital assets are locked up in specific wallets for governance purposes, in exchange for a yield.  A significant component of banks’ custody services for traditional assets includes securities lending – will they also enter the crypto lending business?  Alex Mascioli, head of institutional services for digital asset prime broker Bequant, reminded us we should not expect a stampede of traditional banks into the crypto asset space – most don’t care.  My colleagues Nik De and Ian Allison spoke to Washington insiders who agree that banks are unlikely to move quickly here, and that larger financial institutions are likely to want more reassurance before they enter the space.  The OCC is currently headed up by Brian Brooks, a former executive at crypto exchange Coinbase. We expected him to attempt to push forward crypto-friendly reform, but to be honest I didn’t think he’d be able to get something this significant through so quickly. This leaves me optimistic that there may be more positive surprises in store.    Standard Chartered has revealed that its venture and innovation arm has been working on a crypto custody offering for the institutional market and the first pilot could launch later this year. TAKEAWAY: This is the most significant step from a large incumbent into the crypto markets so far – Standard Chartered is present in 70 countries, and is one of the 100 largest companies in terms of market cap listed on the London Stock Exchange. Apparently it was considering setting up a crypto marketplace, but realized that a significant barrier for its clients was the lack of big-balance-sheet custody services. So far, about 20 institutions have expressed interest, according to the company, which is not insignificant but nor is it a huge amount. It remains to be seen how this strategy fits in with its recent investment in Switzerland-based institutional crypto custodian Metaco.      Avanti, a crypto-focused financial company known as a Special Purpose Depositary Institution (SPDI) based in Wyoming and founded by long-time crypto advocate Caitlin Long, will launch in October. TAKEAWAY: Avanti aims to compete with traditional banks for crypto business, and has a head start, not just in terms of its crypto credibility (Caitlin Long has been instrumental in pushing forward blockchain-friendly legislation in Wyoming, which other states are starting to emulate). It also has the flexibility to innovate on how banking works, and has started with a token called the Avit. Details are still thin, but it seems like it will be a digital token for settlement purposes, not pegged to the U.S. dollar but issued by a bank under existing U.S. commercial laws, which confer transaction finality. I’m looking forward to learning more about this.      The price of ether, ethereum’s native token, has more than doubled so far this year, dwarfing bitcoin’s +34% rise. But its fees have risen by much more, signalling growing congestion on the network. ETH fees are now averaging well over $1 per transaction, up from just $0.04 at the beginning of the year. TAKEAWAY: Proposals are in the works to reform the fee structure, and the whole network is heading toward a profound technology change that should solve the scaling problem (we dive into the upcoming change in detail in our latest report “Ethereum 2.0: How It Works and Why It Matters”). These changes will take time, however, and escalating fees tend to eventually choke activity on a network. For now, though, the transaction count is showing no signs of abating. Worth watching.      The universe of listed crypto companies is still small (my colleague Matt Yamamoto has written reports on two of them: Ebang and Hut 8), but that could well change in the very near future. TAKEAWAY: With Ant Financial listing on the Hong Kong and Shanghai exchanges, and a rumored Coinbase listing in the offing, there could soon be high-market-cap opportunities for all types of investors. An argument can be made that this would be even better for the sector than a bitcoin ETF, as funds flowing into listed crypto companies would spread mainstream investment across a range of crypto assets and blockchain applications, rather than just bitcoin.      To get an idea of the potential impact of even a teensy portion of U.S. equity investment reaching the crypto sector, my colleague Shuai Hao prepared this scorching graphic:      And for any current or future token enthusiasts out there who have kids (or were once one themselves), you can now get a Dr. Seuss collectible non-fungible token (NFT) of your very own. TAKEAWAY: NFTs may sound like a quirky niche application now, but they could end up playing a significant role in markets through the creation of investment opportunities in art, for instance. Or, and here it could get even more interesting, in identity applications. An NFT basically enjoys all the same advantages of blockchain-based tokens (ease of transfer, traceability, sovereign control, etc.) – but there is a verifiably limited number.
