This had brought the total market cap down to yearly lows as large and small cryptocurrencies alike suffered. However, there is starting to be a turn in the tide with the new week. The crypto market cap, which had been trending below $900 for the better part of the week, had put on $100 billion. Crypto Sentiment Begins To Turn The crypto market cap still remains below $1 trillion but it has recovered to a good point. With the price of bitcoin above $22,000, it has gotten close to reclaiming this crucial position. Another thing that has pushed the crypto market cap has been the recovery of Ethereum, whose recent bullish tendencies have rubbed off on other smart contract platforms in the space.

Crypto market cap recovers close to $1 trillion | Source: Crypto Total Market Cap on TradingView.com For the better part of June, the index had been in the ‘Extreme Fear’ territory. This was as the bear trend raged on, and investors had taken a step back from the market due to the losses. This saw the market close out the month with one of the lowest scores in the interest of the index with a 6. However, as some cryptocurrencies in the market have recovered, so has the market sentiment. The Fear & Greed Index presently sits at a score of 20 at the time of this writing. So although it still remains in the extreme fear territory, it is up 14 points from last month’s close. Related Reading | Mid Cap Crypto Coins Lead In July, Best Way To Weather The Winter? There is no doubt that bitcoin’s recovery above $22,000 has a lot to do with this. The pioneer cryptocurrency is a market mover, and if it continues to grow, it is expected that market sentiment will recover more. One thing to note, though, is that such large recoveries in such a short time can lead to sell-offs. Mainly, investors often see such moves as a ‘bull trap’; hence they try to get out of the market before the inevitable retracement. Over the last 24 hours, there have been more BTC going into centralized exchanges with a positive net flow of 725.2 million.

The most valuable cryptocurrency is currently bumping up into resistance at the 200-week moving average, which also happens to be the top of the trading range that BTC has been stuck in since the middle of June. Over the past five weeks, attempts to break above this level have been repeatedly rejected, proving it to be a difficult nut to crack.

81469,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4524062-microstrategys-bitcoin-driven-rally-already-started?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1658184594,MicroStrategy's Bitcoin-Driven Rally Has Already Started (Technical Analysis),"MSTR is up 40%+ since my last bullish piece a few weeks ago. However, I think the current consolidation is a sustainable bottom. There is a possibility of a short squeeze should we get a breakout. The relentless selling that took place in risk assets earlier this year saw the prices of growth-oriented assets plummet. That certainly created some pain for investors, but as I've made clear in my posts in the past month or so, the worst, I believe, is a long way behind us. That has me looking forward to assets that I think are great buys, and back in mid-June, that led me to MicroStrategy ( MSTR ). MicroStrategy is an enterprise software company, but I dare say no one cares that it has a software business any longer. About two years ago, the company began buying Bitcoin (BTC-USD) to add to its balance sheet, and it has become one of the largest Bitcoin holders in the world. That has made MicroStrategy simply a leveraged play on the price of Bitcoin, because the software business is far too small to matter in the context of the company's Bitcoin holdings. Now, I said on June 21st that I thought Bitcoin was bottoming , and so far, so good; I haven't seen anything occur in the past month that has put me off of this position. Should we get a further breakdown, I will come off of it, but the facts are the facts and to my eye, they support a sustainable bottom. With that in mind, if you're bullish on Bitcoin, you should be very bullish on MicroStrategy. Also in mid-June, I published a bullish piece on MicroStrategy that said if you're looking for Bitcoin exposure, you want to own MicroStrategy . Seeking Alpha The stock is up 42% since then, against +3% for the S&P 500. I had several reasons for liking MicroStrategy then, and in this article, I intend to provide an update given we've seen such an enormous move in the past five weeks or so. Now that we have some context, let's begin with a daily chart. StockCharts MicroStrategy has produced some very bullish price action in the past few weeks, which is hardly surprising given the 40%+ gain. However, this is building a more bullish case for me, rather than it looking like the move is over. Has the easy money been made already? Certainly. Are we done? I don't think so. I've drawn in a symmetrical triangle on the price chart with higher lows and lower highs. That triangle is converging on itself, so we'll get resolution one way or the other shortly, probably within less than two weeks. The direction this triangle breaks will determine the next big move of the stock, so watch that carefully. Obviously, you can tell which way I'm leaning. Note also that the stock has closed above the 20-day exponential moving average several times, which is indicative of the start of a new uptrend. In addition, the 20-day EMA is about to cross over the 50-day simple moving average in a bullish way, which is yet another indicator the worst is behind us. The next step after the crossover will be getting the 50-day SMA to turn higher, which I expect will happen over the course of the next few weeks. Next, the accumulation/distribution line is moving up for the first time in months, which means big money is buying dips rather than selling rips. The A/D line on its own is never a reason to buy or sell, but in the context of what else we can see, it's one more reason to be bullish. The PPO looks very bullish at this point, having made what should be a significant bottom, and very nearly getting all the way back to the centerline from -20 on this rally. When we pull back next, I expect a much higher low on the PPO, which again, suggests a sustainable bottom. The 14-day RSI is making similar moves to the PPO, showing improving momentum as the stock rallies. One note on the 10-day rate of change in the bottom panel is that we're up ~30% in the space of two weeks, so don't be surprised to see some consolidation and/or selling to work that off. This stock moves in huge magnitudes all the time, so rallies like this happen. Selloffs in similar magnitudes happen too, so I just wanted to point out we're overbought on very short time frames. That favors one more rejection inside the triangle before the final push out, but we'll see. Just something to keep in mind. Now, let's take a look at the price of MicroStrategy relative to Bitcoin itself. This is a measure of relative value, which is highly relevant given MicroStrategy is simply a proxy for Bitcoin at this point. In the chart below, the relative value of MicroStrategy to Bitcoin improves as the line moves down, and deteriorates (or becomes more expensive) as the line moves up. This is a two-year chart, roughly corresponding to when the company began stockpiling Bitcoin. StockCharts We can see here the value of MicroStrategy relative to Bitcoin was extremely strong two months ago. It was still quite good a month ago, and even today is well towards the bottom end of the historical range. I'm not suggesting we'll see a return to the dizzying heights of when MicroStrategy's share price was 6X what it is today, but on a relative basis, the stock is still very cheap against the asset with which it shares its fate. That means that when/if Bitcoin rallies, we could get a two-fold tailwind on MicroStrategy of 1) rising underlying Bitcoin value and 2) multiple expansion back to historical levels. Other considerations While I'm painting a bullish picture, there are, of course, immense risks in owning any cryptocurrency, or related stock. MicroStrategy has placed massive bets on the future price action of Bitcoin, and if it doesn't work, the company could be forced to liquidate at very low prices, destroying enormous amounts of money in the process. That's a risk, and something you want to keep in mind if you decide to take a position. This is about as far from a buy-and-forget stock as I can think of. The first half of 2022 has been a stark reminder to us all about how quickly things can unravel in the world of risk assets, and we have no guarantees that Bitcoin has actually made a bottom. I cannot count how many forecasts I've seen in recent weeks about how Bitcoin is doomed and going to $10k or $12k before it bottoms. That's the kind of sentiment I love because it means pessimism is very high. It's difficult to buy in the face of a constant drum of negative news, but that's exactly the time you want to buy. Another reason I love technical analysis is that it takes all of that noise away and just focuses on facts of price action. Let others generate fear and moaning while we focus instead on making money. The failures we've seen in the world of cryptos have been alarming, but remember that any industry going through a downturn sees failures. How many banks went under during the financial crisis? How many consumer discretionary companies fail during recessions? The list goes on, but those industries don't die out; we simply lose the weakest players. So long as you don't spend your capital on the weakest players, the risk of a total blowup should be manageable. That's a choice each investor must make for themselves, but crypto haters trumpeting a handful of failures as indicative of cryptos being a doomed venture is ridiculous. I'll mention again something I talked about in my last piece on MicroStrategy, and that is the risk of a margin call . The level of $21k on Bitcoin was said to be critical for the loans the company has taken out to buy Bitcoin. This is one of the additional risks of MicroStrategy; the company is leveraged using ~$2.4 billion in long-term debt for some of its Bitcoin purchases. However, the company had over 90,000 unencumbered Bitcoin last month as well, meaning it would simply contribute more Bitcoin to the collateral of the debt, thereby avoiding a margin call. The margin call ended up being fear for no reason, given the price of Bitcoin went well below $21k for a brief period of time. If Bitcoin falls below $21k again, just keep in mind the company owns almost $2 billion worth of unencumbered Bitcoin. One final point I will make is that MicroStrategy's short interest is up to 38% , according to Seeking Alpha . When two in five shares are shorted, volatility tends to be enormous, but there's another important thing to remember. Short squeezes are a real phenomenon, but remember that they are very rare. Certain conditions must be met, including a very high percentage of the float being shorted, but we also need a high-volume breakout. If I'm right about the current consolidation resolving higher, we could see a short squeeze. To be clear, I'm not saying we need a short squeeze for the bull case to work, but I am saying that it's a possibility. Once price reaches a point where a majority of shorts are underwater, that's when the panic buying could set in. It's impossible to know that exact point because we don't know when the 38% of the float was shorted. However, high-volume breakouts tend to produce squeezes if they're going to happen. We shall see. Final thoughts I haven't seen anything in the past month or so that has put me off the bull case for Bitcoin. That's key for the bull case for MicroStrategy, and I'm certainly still bullish. The 40%+ move we've seen since my last article was really nice, but I also think there's a lot more left on this one in the coming months. Volatility will remain epic on this one, so if you're risk-averse, this isn't for you. But by using technical analysis, we can remove the fear and emotion and put the odds in our favor. The bottom line is that I think MicroStrategy's current consolidation will resolve higher in the weeks to come, and if you're bullish on Bitcoin, this is one to keep on your watchlist.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4524062-microstrategys-bitcoin-driven-rally-already-started?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/81469.jpeg

It remains tightly correlated with bitcoin and its future directly depends on how long this crypto bear market will last. It has a $6.1 billion safety cushion of liquidity which should help it withstand another year of high volatility. Investment Thesis Coinbase (COIN) has declined 80% since reaching its all-time high of $360 in November last year, eroding $48 billion of its value. So, what has happened? There are several causes. Firstly, general trend of growth stocks being hammered at times of rising interest rates and increasing equity premiums. Second, the bitcoin price collapse of 60%. And the last, but not least, its poor earnings results and the cash drainage of USD 1.58 billion in Q1-22. These factors led us to make significant adjustments to our FCF valuation model with new target price being revised downwards to $52. This price is in line with the current market, so we changed our view to hold and will monitor how things develop in the crypto market for any further analysis. Crypto Selloff As we have thoroughly examined in our previous article, Coinbase has always had high correlation with Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) due to substantial retail traders involvement and a nature of its business. Considering recent crypto selloff, it is not surprising that COIN has had a massive hit with its revenues falling by a half and its operating cash flow flipping from a profit of USD 846 million in Q4-2021 to a cash loss of USD 830 million in Q1 this year. Thus, one of the risks we’ve talked before have materialised and as COIN is relatively young venture with its revenues still not sufficiently diversified between retail and institutional money, we saw a massive drop in its share price. How things will develop for COIN from now on mainly depend on the developments on the crypto market and this is a big unknown. What we’ve learned so far is that crypto is not a hedge against equity market drawdowns and its diversification benefits were hugely overstated in the past. Since the beginning of this year the S&P lost 18% while BTC was down 54% with Coinbase falling 75%. Seeking Alpha charting section Bitcoin's selloff was caused by two main factors: a) FED and other central banks hawkishness in response to increased inflation and b) the collapse of the Terra blockchain that happened in May. The latter event forced Luna Foundation Guard to sell 80k Bitcoins which aimed to support dollar-peg of its UST stablecoin. This dump created a massive selling pressure with BTC price dropping from USD 39k to USD 29k in a matter of days early May. It also didn’t help UST from the collapse and the peg was subsequently broken with the stablecoin price slumping from $37 to less than a dollar. This event created jitters in crypto space with retail traders rushing to get rid of their crypto positions. From the charting perspective BTC has breached many technically important levels such as 200-week moving average and its cost basis realised price – the levels that have not been breached at other major bitcoin selloffs in 2014 and 2018. It created more downside pressure with BTC looking for a support at a technically important $20k which currently holds. ARK Invest Bitcoin Monthly May 2022 Report Looking at other indicators that are in some way considered as fundamentals of Bitcoin, such as, bitcoin short-term holders vs long-term holders cost basis ratio we can see that there has been a capitulation of short term holders but the ratio has still some room to go towards the support it held in 2015 and 2019. Chart published by beINcrypto Another positive factor is that the number of total address has actually kept increasing and is nearing 1 billion total addresses (990 million as of 20th June 2022), which indicates continuous Bitcoin adoption. Bitcoin: number of active addresses (Glassnodestudio) It is always hard to call a market bottom and when analysing past crypto bear markets we can see that the selloff in 2014/2015 lasted nearly two years while the one in 2018 lasted 360 days. The average length of a US stock bear market is approx. 9 to 10 months but there are massive disparities with the shortest one being 33 days and the longest 622 days over the 1929–2021 period. We cannot also look at bitcoin fundamentals in a vacuum as we need to consider overall state of the economy, inflation, war etc. All of these factors will depend on how long this bear market will last. To sum up, fundamentally bitcoin market looks healthy and there are indications of bitcoin being oversold. However, its further price development cannot be looked at in isolation and hugely depends on current macro developments such as inflation, political uncertainty, the length of the war in Ukraine to name just a few. Financials COIN Q1-2022 results were on a weak side, but it has been widely expected considering the turmoil on the crypto market. Its monthly users declined from 11.4 million to 9.2 million QoQ, but were still 50% higher than in Q1 last year. Its trading volume declined in line with crypto assets volatility. Coinbase Q1-2022 Shareholders letter (Coinbase Q1-2022 Shareholders letter) Its revenue fell 49% to USD 1.2 billion, and COIN recorded its first quarter net loss since its IPO. Although transactions expenses fell 45% as these are directly linked to revenues, its operational cost side overall increased by 9% mainly due to a headcount growth as COIN increased its total staff by 33% in this quarter. COIN did not provide any indication of their cost management plans at the earnings call, but we’ve seen reports in FT in June that they are planning to cut nearly fifth of its staff. Total net loss was USD 430 million while adjusted EBITDA was USD 20 million (down from USD 1.2 billion QoQ). Its cash flow also turned negative USD 1.5 billion with operating cash flow recording a loss of USD 830 million and its investing cash flow negative USD 691 million (primarily driven by investments in crypto assets). The company has $6.1 billion in liquidity which should be able to help it to withstand three to four quarters of cash drainage without additional financing so its financial soundness directly depends on how long this bitcoin bear market will last. Valuation Since our previous article on Coinbase in February this year we had to adjust our valuation model quite dramatically. Firstly, our revenue projections have been reviewed downwards in two nearest years. We estimate topline number to fall 20% in 2022 and to be flat in 2023 (vs previous projection of average 18% increase in both years). This is based on the past crypto selloffs precedents as in both 2014/15 and 2018/19 we saw nearly a year of directionless trading following the bear market in crypto. Author’s projections of revenue growth (Author's calculation) Another substantial adjustment was to the CAPM model. US Treasury 10-Year that we use as a proxy for the risk-free rate increased from 1.8% to 3% and we have also revised equity risk premium towards 10% to account for increased volatility in crypto market space. As a result, the WACC rate which we use to discount FCF has been increased from 11% to 18%. Author’s FCF valuation (author's calculation) As a result of discussed adjustments our target price of the stock is around $52 which is exactly where it is trading now. For investors with a different appetite to risk we also present sensitivity table below which shows the target price dependency on equity risk premium. Author's calculation The current average market risk premium in the United States is 5.6%, so if we use that then the target price would be around $160. Risks As we have mentioned in the previous article there are three main risks associated with cryptocurrency exchanges and these are high correlation with bitcoin, regulation, and cybersecurity threats. Bitcoin fundamentals look compelling, but judging by the most recent narratives the market has probably some room to decline further. The market also expects Mt Gox to release BTC 137k to its creditors as early as August which may add to existing selling pressure. Are there chances that the bear market in bitcoin is not going to end? I personally think it is highly unlikely as we have already seen several bear markets in crypto space and with each subsequent one the chances of following price recovery are increasing because the market is getting more mature with a growing number of developers and investors. Summary Considering current state of the crypto market we had to implement substantial adjustments to some of the inputs in the free cash flow valuation model, which have impacted target price downward revision to $52 (vs previous $358) which is in line with the current market price. Coinbase remains very tightly correlated with the bitcoin price which poses huge risks at times of crypto bear markets. According to the latest narratives and an upcoming unlock of 137k BTC we believe we will see another leg down in the bitcoin price which will add more selling pressure in the near term. Whether COIN be able to withstand this period of high volatility depends on how long the current bear market will last. With a cash buffer of $6 billion COIN has some cushion for a time being, but if there is no recovery in crypto market by the Q1/Q2 next year and with no additional financing we think COIN may get in trouble. We currently maintain hold view on this stock based on the FCF model and believe we need to see some recovery in crypto market before revising our COIN forecast.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4524053-coinbase-remains-uncharted-waters-amidst-crypto-selloff?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/79262.jpeg

Technically, Bitcoin is very oversold and has a good chance to form a little recovery over the coming weeks. The beaten-down panic sentiment provides the best contrarian buy signal in over two years. Macro Update - As Panic & Recession unfold in 2022, the one and only question is, when will the Fed end its tightening cycle? A worldwide asset price meltdown is shaking up the minds of all investors & traders these days. Nothing seems safe anymore and the crypto sector was hit the hardest. Review With the clear break of the support around 37,500 USD, the sell-off in the crypto sector intensified dramatically from the beginning of May and Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) prices plunged to 25,400 USD within just one week. Despite the already heavily oversold situation at that time, only a tentative recovery or countermovement succeeded afterwards, which already found its end at 32,375 USD. Starting June 6th, bears went directly into attack mode and pushed Bitcoin prices within just 12 days down to 17,600 USD, the lowest level since December 2020. Following this crash, prices are once again only very slowly and tentatively getting back on their feet. So far, they have only managed to recover to 22,400 USD. The bottom line is that Bitcoin has lost almost 75% from its all-time high around 69,000 USD on November 10th, 2021. Ethereum (-81.9%) ( ETH-USD ) and the larger altcoins such as Solana (-90%) ( SOL-USD ), Polygon (-89.2%) ( MATIC-USD ), ChainLink (-89.6%) ( LINK-USD ), Cardano (-87%) ( ADA-USD ) were punished even more severely. The smaller altcoins, however, have almost all lost 90-99% across the board. Brutal Wave of Bankruptcies Overall, the crypto sector has been hit hard as the brutal wave of bankruptcies - Luna (LUNC-USD), Celsius (CEL-USD), Three Arrows Capital , Voyager Digital (VYGVQ), BlockFi, Babel Finance, etc. - has been unfolding. The chaotic turmoil has wiped out more than 2 trillion USD in market capitalization and cost thousands of jobs in just a few months . An end to the shakeout is not yet in sight due to the opaque interconnections within the industry and a large number of speculators or inexperienced players. When asset prices collapse or a counter-party defaults on a massive loan, the lender's balance sheets are left with huge holes. The residual liquidation of collateral then leads to even more loans coming due, which leads to further liquidation of collateral. As a result, numerous trading venues have limited or blocked user withdrawals in recent weeks, further drying up liquidity. Retail investors who had trusted these lenders to protect their assets or, in particular, to generate high returns have, in some cases, lost everything. Add to this the fear of a global recession accompanied by the worst inflation in more than 40 years. Despite the huge losses, therefore, the end of the storm may not yet have been seen. Technical Analysis for Bitcoin in US-Dollar Bitcoin Weekly Chart - Opportunity for a recovery Bitcoin in USD, weekly chart as of July 13th, 2022. (TradingView) Bitcoin as well as the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( BTC )"" target=""_blank"">OTC:GBTC ) have been in a harsh correction for a little over eight months now. Apart from a somewhat extended rally in February and March, the bulls had hardly anything to offer in terms of resistance. Even the 10-year uptrend line (dark green) was ultimately an easy game for the bears. Now, Bitcoin prices cling to the middle line of the overriding uptrend channel. This, together with the completely oversold stochastic oscillator and the previous all-time high around 20,000 USD, forms a certain support, which currently seems to hold. Overall, the weekly chart is still bearish for now, but the chances of a recovery might outweigh the gloomy picture in the coming weeks. As we know from the past, bear market rallies in Bitcoin can be extreme. Realistic recovery targets are around 25,400 USD and maybe 29,750 USD as well. Bitcoin Daily Chart - Bollinger bands are tightening Bitcoin in USD, daily chart as of July 13th, 2022. (TradingView) On the daily chart, a consolidation has developed again since the low on June 18th, which could turn out to be a flag formation similar to the ones before. In any case, the low at 17,592 USD was not undercut in the last three and a half weeks. The stochastic still has an active sell signal, but the oscillator has already almost reached the oversold zone. If the stabilization around 20,000 USD succeeds at the same time, a recovery in the direction of the upper Bollinger band (22,021 USD) and up to the vicinity of the May low at 25,401 USD would be possible. In summary, the daily chart is currently still bearish. At the same time, some stabilization tendencies are visible between 19,000 USD and 21,500 USD. Together with the relatively large distance to the fast-falling 200-day moving average (36,122 USD), there are some arguments for a relief rally in the summer on the table. Sentiment Bitcoin - Relief Rally in the Summer? Crypto Fear & Greed Index, as of July 12th, 2022. (Lookintobitcoin) The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has been trading in the deep dark red panic zone since the beginning of April, and thus for more than three months now. Hence, fear in the crypto sector runs very deep. Crypto Fear & Greed Index long term, as of July 12th, 2022. (Lookintobitcoin) In the big picture, the current dark red situation in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index resembles the setup from January 2019. Back then, the crypto winter had also hit brutally, and it took almost three months for Bitcoin to get a massive recovery rally going. New lows were not seen in the bottoming phase back then. In total, the beaten-down panic sentiment provides the best contrarian buy signal in over two years! Seasonality Bitcoin Seasonality for bitcoin, as of July 11th, 2022. (Seasonax) Due to the weak price performance in the first six months of this year, the still young seasonal pattern for Bitcoin has weakened or flattened significantly. Nevertheless, according to the statistics, there should be a wave down starting at the end of August, which could possibly run parallel to another sell-off in the stock markets. There, too, September has not earned itself a good name but is traditionally regarded as the worst month of the year for the stock market. Until mid-August, however, the seasonal outlook does not stand in the way of a small recovery rally in the crypto sector. Overall, the seasonal component continues to urge patience and caution. The situation should not brighten up until mid/late October from a statistical perspective. A small summer rally, however, would be possible in the coming weeks. Sound Money: Bitcoin vs. Gold Bitcoin/Gold-Ratio as of July 12th, 2022. (TradingView) Analogous to the crash of Bitcoin, the Bitcoin/gold-ratio also fell in recent months and is currently trading around 11.5. Thus, Bitcoin has lost almost 75% against gold since November 2021! At current prices of around 20,000 USD for one Bitcoin and around 1,710 USD for a troy ounce of gold, one has to pay almost 11.5 ounces of gold for one Bitcoin. Put another way, an ounce of gold ( XAUUSD:CUR ) currently costs about 0.085 Bitcoin. Given the strongly oversold situation on the weekly chart near the 78.6% retracement, the chances for a countermovement or recovery are not bad at the moment. In the best case, a retracement to the broken support in the area around 15 to 16 would be conceivable. If Bitcoin bears remain in control, however, the ratio could also be pushed directly down to around 5 to 6 in the coming months. Allocation of Sound Money Generally, buying and selling Bitcoin against gold only makes sense to the extent that one balances the allocation in those two asset classes! At least 10% up to a maximum of 25% of one's total assets should be invested in precious metals physically, while in cryptos and especially in Bitcoin one should hold at least 1% but max. 5%. If you are very familiar with cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin, you can certainly allocate much higher percentages to Bitcoin on an individual basis. For the average investor, who is primarily invested in equities and real estate, a maximum of 5% in the still highly speculative and highly volatile Bitcoin is a good guideline! Overall, you want to own gold and Bitcoin, since opposites complement each other. In our dualistic world of Yin and Yang, body and mind, up and down, warm and cold, we are bound by the necessary attraction of opposites. In this sense, you can view gold and Bitcoin as such a pair of strength. With the physical component of gold and the pristine digital features of Bitcoin, you have a complementary unit of a true safe haven for the 21st century. You want to own both! - Florian Grummes In summary, the Bitcoin/gold-ratio suggests a recovery in favor of Bitcoin in the coming weeks. One should not hope for too much given the difficult overall situation, but a rise to around 15 seems possible. While gold often lost out in 2020 and 2021, it was able to fully play out its conservative character this year and is the longed-for safe haven in the portfolio despite slight price declines. Macro Update - Panic & Recession of 2022 The world is changing faster than ever before. The political landscape is shifting rapidly around the world and becoming more unpredictable by the day. While technology is changing everything we do, tensions in society are increasing in almost every part of the world. Yet, an ounce of gold remains an ounce of gold. Likewise, one Bitcoin remains one Bitcoin. Global Credit Impulse, as of July 7th, 2022. (The Macro Compass & Alfonso Peccatiello) More than 50 years after Nixon repealed the gold standard, monetary policy has its back against the wall, as the Fed's fight against inflation could soon plunge the world into a depressive abyss. Just two weeks after the start of its quantitative tightening program, the markets are already behaving like a junkie in withdrawal. Due to massive fiscal pressures as well as hesitant refinancing activity in the private sector, we are now witnessing a contraction in credit creation that is even faster than during the Great Financial Crisis of 2008! The Fed's balancing act of fighting inflation without triggering severe dislocations in the markets is therefore doomed to fail. The vehemence of the tightening cycle that has just begun threatens to turn the ""Everything Bubble"" into an ""Everything Crash."" When Will the Fed End its Tightening Cycle? US Yield Curve vs. Prior Tightening Cycles, as of July 12, 2022. (Crescat Capital & Tavi Costa) It is therefore realistic to expect that US monetary policy will have to deviate from the current hawkish monetary policy stance sooner rather than later and make a U-turn. However, it cannot be ruled out that the Fed will once again act far too late. Currently, the yield curve in the US is already turning. In the past 30 years, this constellation has forced the Fed to end its tightening cycle every time. Since the systemic risk is now greater than ever before in history, the Fed can no longer afford to make a wrong decision. Fed pivot indicator, as of July 11th, 2022. (The Happy Hawaiian) In fact, some indications now suggest that the Fed will have to react soon. With the next rate hike, the Fed would presumably and knowingly blow up the financial system. Hence, even the verbal suggestion that rate hikes would be suspended or at least slowed down should therefore be enough at the moment to trigger a summer relief rally in all markets. Likewise, somewhat weaker U.S. inflation data is expected due to the global contraction, which the markets should also take with great relief. In addition, the U.S. dollar index ( USDU ) has had a tremendous ride, rising almost uninterruptedly by a total of +21.25% over the past 14 months. A breather in the U.S. dollar should bring a sigh of relief in the equity, commodity, precious metals and crypto markets. Overall, the chances for a recovery in all markets during the coming summer weeks are therefore not bad. From mid-August or September at the latest, however, the bears are likely to come back. Conclusion: Bitcoin - Relief Rally in the Summer? After a month-long sell-off, including a nasty wave of bankruptcies, Bitcoin is currently trading just below 20,000 USD. Eight months ago, very few people would have expected this. Now, however, bullish market participants are rare and numerous experts are coming up with renewed lower price targets for Bitcoin. The Bitcoin network itself, on the other hand, completely unimpressed by the ""Lehman moment"" in the crypto sector, continues to process any cryptographically legitimate payments via a computer network of equal computers (peer-to-peer) without any problems. In the context of the equity markets, which have also seen a severe correction and have correlated strongly with the crypto sector in recent months, a short-term recovery opportunity can be discerned due to the heavily oversold situation. In fact, a summer relief rally towards around 25,000 USD and maybe even close to around 30,000 USD could be possible, especially if inflation declines slightly and the Fed adopts a somewhat milder tone. Nevertheless, the end of the crypto winter is still likely to be a long time away. In any case, prices below 20,000 USD offer a good entry opportunity in the long run. But we believe that a bottom around 10,000 USD is more likely in the next 3 to 12 months.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4524047-bitcoin-relief-rally-in-summer?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/78258.jpeg

Users of the platform will be able to use MakerDAO’s stablecoin, DAI, as collateral and withdraw up to one million nuARS, a stablecoin tied to the Argentine peso, the company said in a statement. At the current exchange rate, the maximum amount is equivalent to $3,333.  Federico Ogue, Buenbit’s CEO, told CoinDesk the product is the first of its kind in Latin America.  “It is a model that emerged abroad but with loans in U.S. dollars, but it does not work for Latin Americans. Who wants to borrow U.S. dollars in the region? Too much risk,” Ogue said.  Users can borrow for loans as long as they collateralize 80% of the requested amount, the company stated, adding that the DAI will be locked into the platform yielding returns.  Read more: Argentines Take Refuge in Stablecoins After Economy Minister Resignation  The nuARS stablecoin, which operates on Binance’s blockchain, was developed by Num Finance, a firm that also plans to launch nuPEN and nuMXN, two stablecoins tied to the Peruvian and Mexican currencies, respectively.  In Peru, Buenbit plans to launch loans in partnership with Num Finance “shortly,” the company said.  In Argentina, users will be able to use nuARS to buy other cryptocurrencies on Buenbit, withdraw or spend them via the prepaid card offered by the exchange, the company added.  After the layoffs  In May, Buenbit laid off 45% of its staff – approximately 80 employees – due to the “global overhaul” in the tech industry, Ogue said via Twitter at the time. It added that the event was not linked to the crash of UST and LUNA.  The company also halted plans to expand into new countries including Chile and Colombia, Ogue told CoinDesk recently, although he did not rule out new openings in 2023. He did not provide further details.  “Exponential growth was more rewarded in the past; now, [it’s] sustainability and profits. That’s what we adjusted the plans around,” Ogue said.  The company is already in talks with investors to raise a new funding round in the third quarter of 2022, which will be minor compared to the $11 million Series A it raised in July 2021, Ogue said.  “This is a smaller round, so as not to commit to a scenario of uncertainty. We will wait to do a bigger round next year with a clearer picture,” Ogue added.  Buenbit plans to remain independent and is not looking to be acquired, Ogue said, although he acknowledged that banks and brokerages have approached the company about the possibility.  Ogue added that Buenbit plans to obtain an exchange license in Gibraltar in three months, following an 18-month process.

Shares of MARA are edging up 1.1% in after-hours trading, adding to the 21.4% jump on the day. APLD stock, meanwhile, is soaring 31.1% during the extended session. Applied Blockchain ( APLD ), on July 12, had agreed to supply Marathon Digital ( MARA ) with 90 megawatts of hosting capacity at its facility in Texas and at least 110 megawatts at its other facility in North Dakota. Across those facilities, Marathon Digital ( MARA ) is expecting to have ~66K miners representing ~9.2 exahash per second (""EH/s""). In addition, Applied Blockchain ( APLD ) has provided Marathon Digital ( MARA ) with the option to increase hosting capabilities utilizing up to an additional 70 megawatts in its North Dakota facility, which would boost the total amount of hosting across Applied Blockchain’s ( APLD ) facilities to 270 megawatts if that option is exercised. The installations of Marathon's ( MARA ) miners are anticipated to commence at those facilities during Q4, with all miners installed by mid-2023. Furthermore, Marathon ( MARA ) on July 5 expanded its hosting arrangements with digital infrastructure firm Compute North to include an additional 42 megawatts of hosting capacity at its facility near Granbury, Texas, according to the release. In turn, Marathon ( MARA ) is shooting for 14K more miners to be installed at Compute North's facility, bringing the total number of miners to ~26K, representing ~3.6 EH/s. Marathon ( MARA ) also secured an additional 12 megawatts of hosting capacity with some other hosting providers, with expectations of installing ~4K miners, representing ~0.8 EH/s, starting in August. “With these new arrangements, we believe we have now secured enough hosting capacity to support our target of achieving approximately 23.3 exahashes per second of computing power for Bitcoin mining in 2023,” said Marathon Digital CEO Fred Thiel, adding that “each of these facilities is already under construction, which is critical for expediting installations.""

Past Performance of TFUEL TFUEL prices have been trending lower within the influence of a bearish trendline during the downfall from $0.076 to $0.041. However, the recent bull cycle results in a double breakout rally, eventually beating the resistance trendline.

Bitcoin (BTC) surged above $22,500 early Monday, hitting its highest price in over a month.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was trading at $21,696, up 3.1% over the past 24 hours.  Oanda Senior Market Analyst Edward Moya said that crypto sentiment is improving amid signs that the global economy will remain on solid footing for the near future and that the U.S. central bank will raise interest rates at its next meeting by 0.75 percentage point, rather than by 1 percentage point as some monetary policy observers had predicted last week.  “If bitcoin continues to stabilize here over the next two weeks, the crypto winter could be over,” Moya said.  GlobalBlock CEO Rufus Round said that he is seeing greater investor commitment to cryptocurrency as markets experience relief.  “We, certainly at GlobalBlock, are seeing professional buyers load up on bitcoin and ether around these levels,” Round said. “It's such a collapse and there's been so much stress in the markets. The forced sellers are hopefully all done by now, and people are seeing value right here, especially given the macroeconomic backdrop.”  Most major altcoins outperformed bitcoin, with Polygon’s MATIC token leading the charts, up 18.4% over the past 24 hours. MATIC surged over 66% over seven days after Disney chose the Ethereum scaling tool as part of its 2022 Accelerator Program.  Ether (ETH) climbed 9% to $1,469. Last Friday, Ethereum’s ninth ""shadow fork"" went live as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap moved closer to its transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake.

Short-Bitcoin Positions Dominate Inflows: CoinShares  Crypto funds had inflows for a third consecutive week with inflows of $12 million in the seven days through July 15, according to a CoinShares report. But a lot of those investments came from investors betting on further price declines in bitcoin.  Short-bitcoin positions, which bet on a price decline in BTC, generated $15 million in inflows. Short-bitcoin inflows reached a record four-week run of $88 million.  Net outflows for long investment products totaled $2.6 million. Traditional bitcoin investment products saw outflows amounting to $2.6 million, while ether-focused funds had $2.5 million of outflows.  “We believe this highlights new investors expecting further price downside, while those currently invested are not selling out of positions, believing crypto prices are close to a bottom,” the authors wrote.  Altcoin funds saw minor inflows with $500,000 of inflows for Solana, $300,000 for XRP and $100,000 for Tron.  Regionally, the U.S. inflows totaled $21 million, outperforming other countries.

42422692,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0otbh,1658174847,Bitcoin Miner Marathon Digital Signs Multiple Hosting Deals to Reach Its Hashrate View,"Aiming to reach its targeted hashrate guidance of 23.3 exahash per second (EH/s) in 2023, Marathon Digital (MARA) – one of the largest bitcoin (BTC) miners – has signed hosting agreements with third parties that will provide a total of up to 254 megawatts of power and capacity.  The miner had previously said it expected to have 23.3 EH/s hashrate capacity installed by early 2023, but continued delays in Texas and ongoing maintenance issues at the company’s Hardin, Montana, facility had raised doubts about reaching that guidance.  “With these new arrangements, we believe we have now secured enough hosting capacity to support our target of achieving approximately 23.3 exahashes per second of computing power for Bitcoin mining in 2023,” Fred Thiel, Marathon’s chairman and CEO, said in a statement on Monday.  Among the deals, Marathon signed a roughly 200MW agreement with hosting company Applied Blockchain (APLD). Applied will supply Marathon with 90MW of hosting capacity at its Texas location and at least 110MW at a second facility in North Dakota, allowing for a total of about 66,000 miners representing approximately 9.2 EH/s, according to the statement. The deal will mark the largest agreement for the hosting company, which went public in April last year.  Applied’s facilities are currently under construction and installation is expected to start during the fourth quarter of 2022 and be completed by mid-2023. The company has power secured and ready for all of Marathon’s mining rigs upon construction completion, CEO Wes Cummins told CoinDesk.  Marathon will have the option to increase its hosting capacities with Applied, for up to 70MW at the North Dakota facilities.  Read more: Marathon Digital Continues to Hodl All Bitcoin but Hints at Strategy Change  Marathon has also signed additional deals with its existing partner Compute North to include 42MW of hosting capacity at Compute North’s facility near Granbury, Texas. Marathon expects to have an additional 14,000 miners installed at this facility, bringing the total number running near Granbury to about 26,000 miners, representing approximately 3.6 EH/s. All of the miners are expected to be installed at this facility before the end of 2022, according to the statement.  Additionally, Marathon has also signed for 12MW of additional hosting capacity with a variety of other providers and expects to install about 4,000 miners with 0.8 EH/s of mining capacity in those locations, starting in August.  Shares of Marathon were up more than 20% on Monday alongside a bounce in the price of bitcoin to $22,000. Applied is ahead 2%.

42421485,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoUpB,1658173810,Crypto Carbon Credits: Slapping Lipstick on a Pig,"It might come as a surprise that one of crypto’s biggest “use cases” has been in combating climate change, considering the overall sentiment around blockchain’s environmental footprint and heavy energy consumption.  In just the last three months of 2021, some $3 billion worth of tokenized carbon credits were traded, accounting for hundreds of millions of metric tons of the greenhouse gas, according to The Wall Street Journal, citing KlimaDAO data.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  In the first six months of this year, at least 23 million carbon credits were moved on-chain from centralized registries, representing about a quarter of credits listed at the time, according to data provider Trove Research.  Then there’s the $423 million that venture capitalists have invested in crypto-based carbon tracking initiatives over the past 18 months.  See also: Crypto Carbon: Can Blockchain Networks Fix Carbon Offsets? | Opinion  Despite this measurable market growth, a big win for those looking to disrupt and democratize the sclerotic world of carbon offsetting, the industry is facing something of an existential crisis. And maybe it’s better to let it die.  This weekend, the WSJ reported that Flowcarbon, the buzzy blockchain project founded by discredited ex-WeWork CEO Adam Neumann and backed by crypto powerhouse Andreessen Horowitz just two months ago, has indefinitely delayed the launch of its suite of products.  The Journal situated this news among a greater trend of high-profile crypto-climate startups that have “either slowed operations or delayed product rollouts” in recent months. This might be just deserts for those that saw Nuemann – who tried to trademark the word “we” – reinvent himself as a crypto-climate advocate and thought, “surely this must be a scam.”  Speaking with the Journal, Flowcarbon’s Chief Executive Dana Gibber said Neumann was not involved day to day and pointed to the crypto market downturn for the pause. (The Celo blockchain-based effort hoped to launch its goddess nature token (GNT) by the end of June, after raising about $70 million in a private presale advertised on its website.)  But there’s a larger issue at foot than a market rout: Last May, the standard-bearer of carbon credits, Verra, announced it would ban the conversion of retired credits into crypto tokens after finding that crypto upstarts were less than accountable. While this hasn’t affected all crypto carbon projects, it has been a major roadblock for many, and it casts doubt that blockchains can ever outrun the human-scale problems plaguing climate advocacy.  In theory, crypto provides a way to bring transparency and liquidity to mostly unregulated and voluntary carbon credit markets. There is no doubt that some of these claims are true, considering how fractured the current carbon credit industry is. But the overall effect is one of slapping lipstick on a pig.  Carbon credits are issued by firms that claim they are removing carbon-dioxide from the atmosphere, either by their business practices or more active conservation efforts like planting trees. While they could help incentivize or finance sustainable efforts, these assets are really just “offsets” that allow others to pollute.  As consumers demand more sustainable practices, companies are turning to carbon offsets for an easy PR win. Crypto exchanges Gemini and FTX, for instance, voluntarily buy credits because they profit indirectly from the energy-intensive proof-of-work process used by the two largest blockchains, Ethereum and Bitcoin. But they are hardly alone in greenwashing.  No amount of market efficiency magic can fix this high-level issue. Crypto can certainly help prevent the “double spending” of carbon credits, can increase access to these markets and even help resolve some of the “governance” issues that have plagued the industry for decades. But isn’t that accelerating what Greenpeace called “a distraction from the real solutions to climate change”?  At worst, crypto carbon credits are a waste of effort and, literally, energy. One of the projects affected by Verra’s hardstop, KlimaDAO, demonstrated this after “sweeping the floor” of old carbon credits hoping to raise the price of polluting.  See also: Will Reality Have Its Revenge on Andreessen Horowitz's Giant New Crypto Fund? | Opinion  The strategy actually worked; it took 5% of Verra’s carbon credits out of circulation by locking them in a treasury (what it called a “black hole”) thereby increasing the cost of carbon credits. However, critics were quick to note that many of the credits it purchased were from retired or dormant projects – so not actually sucking carbon out of the atmosphere.  That’s not quite as wasteful as restarting formerly mothballed coal power plants to mine bitcoin but is resurfacing carbon at least indirectly.  Again, many of the issues that plague crypto carbon credits are simply inherent to the overall market. There’s no consensus about how to value these assets or what makes a green project green. There’s also little oversight that ensures projects are doing what they promise.  “Proponents of blockchain celebrate its capacity for transparency. But if this power is wielded only on tracing transactions, not the details of what’s being transacted or by whom, we’ve missed a trick – especially in such a heterogeneous market,” Sarah Leugers of Gold Standard wrote in a Carbon Pulse op-ed.  It’s also hard to see how some of the promises of blockchain will play out, like the hope that it could make these assets “interoperable.” The issue here is that carbon credits are usually issued by individual companies or projects and sometimes brokers, making a uniform standard difficult.  While it’s possible for there to be “atomic swaps” and cross-chain assets, at this point there’s little indication that these crypto projects alone will become interoperable, let alone harmonize the entire market.  In fact, one major criticism of crypto’s role in carbon markets has been increased market confusion – stemming from the increasing number of players and having to check whether an asset is live on-chain.  That said, Verra hasn’t soured entirely on crypto-based carbon credits, and except for the most ardent critics, many see the potential for blockchain’s transparency for this industry. Both crypto and combating climate change are decades-long processes, and it’s likely that innovation and reinvention will come.  But, at this stage, much like Adam Neumann’s reinvention of real estate/the office/climate advocacy, this is a hollow effort.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/07/18/crypto-carbon-credits-slapping-lipstick-on-a-pig,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/db9d5ed2431b9974d7428014f858d7691f321f4a-1640x1230.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421141,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXZWG5,1658172843,Ex-CFTC Chairman Discusses Celsius' Bankruptcy and CBDC Adoption,"The bankruptcy hearing of Celsius Network could bring greater legal certainty as people continue to use crypto lending platforms, former Commodity and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chief J. Christoper Giancarlo told CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program Monday.  Giancarlo, now a senior counsel at law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher, said that while the restructuring proposal is only a starting point for the Hoboken, N.J.-headquartered lending platform, it will be the first time a federal bankruptcy court will weigh in on a crypto collateral-based bankruptcy.  “It’s for the good that [those issues] get sorted out because it’s going to be one of those mile markers in the progression of this new asset class,” Giancarlo said. “The regime that will be followed on a bankruptcy will be more clearly articulated.”  Celsius’ lawyers are scheduled to appear before the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York on Monday, after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last week.  While some experts claim Celsius could survive, Giancarlo noted that the Celsius “Chapter 11 filing is different.” Bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code allows a company to regroup, not put it out of business. That period of restructuring and reorganization ""is exactly what Celsius is attempting to do.”  He pointed out that in most cases “we often think about bankruptcy as the final step in the end of a company or enterprise’s existence.”  Whether the platform will emerge unscathed has yet to be seen, however.  “Even management themselves seem to be admitting that they’ve made some bad moves [and] some bad decisions,” he said, but added that “bad decisions [are] endemic to business.”  Giancarlo said that while the decisions made by Celsius point to misguided business practices, the same can be applied to any business enterprises, not just those involving crypto.  “Whenever you've got humans in business, you're going to have mistakes. This company [Celsius] seems to be ready to admit [its] fair share of them,” Giancarlo said.  China’s digital yuan and CBDC adoption  Giancarlo, who is also co-founder of the Digital Dollar Foundation, told CoinDesk TV that within a decade a third of the world could be using Chinese technology to power their digital assets. He points to China's adoption of the digital yuan (e-CNY) as a model other countries could soon follow.  “It’s programmable, it’s networkable into all kinds of devices from mobile phones to wristwatches as well as networked into the broader commercial activity,” he said. “It’s quite sophisticated.”  But the digital yuan also has the “ability to perform surveillance and censorship,” he added, which could be an attribute “a lot of countries around the world that don’t have free societies would like to have and would like to import.”  Monitoring financial activity could also raise the question of “what happens in a run-on-the-bank situation,” Giancarlo noted.  The benefits and drawbacks of a U.S. central bank digital currency (CBDC) are areas the Digital Dollar Foundation wants to explore as it works to create pilot testing.  “'Would a digital dollar be more quickly withdrawn from bank accounts in a run or could the opposite be true? Could people actually be more reluctant to withdraw their money or less ready to withdraw?’” he said.  In comparison, there are about 250 million registered digital wallets holding China’s digital yuan, which could make it the world’s largest pilot project, he said. Other financial powerhouses like the United States and Europe “need to take notice,” he added.  “Within 10 years you could see Chinese CBDC technology and infrastructure in place in as much as a third of the globe,” he said.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/07/18/ex-cftc-chairman-discusses-celsius-bankruptcy-and-cbdc-adoption,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b0e3b99f88d855f734d16bf538604752801761b8-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Will the recovery hold this time? Bitcoin Makes 2nd Attempt To Break Above Realized Price In 10 Days As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, BTC may be finally shooting above the realized price again after spending 33 days below the level in total. To understand what the “realized price” is, it’s best to first take a look at a quick explanation of the two main capitalization methods for Bitcoin. The “market cap” is calculated by multiplying each coin in circulation right now with the current BTC price, and taking the total sum (or more simply, it’s just the total number of coins multiplied by the price). Where the “realized cap” differs is that, instead of taking the same one price for all, it rather weighs each coin against the value of BTC at which the particular coin was last moved/sold. Related Reading | Bitcoin Bearish Signal: Exchange Netflows Spike Up For example, suppose the current Bitcoin price is $22k and there are two coins in circulation. If one of these last moved at $22k while the other at $15k, then the market cap will be $44k, but the realized cap will be $37k. Now, the realized price is measured by just dividing the realized cap by the total number of coins in circulation. The below chart shows the trend in this metric over the past month: Looks like the BTC price is crossing over the metric's line | Source: CryptoQuant As you can see in the above graph, the value of Bitcoin very briefly spiked above the realized price around ten days ago, before slamming down again, Historically, late stage bear markets have lasted while the price of the crypto has remained below the metric’s line, with it acting as resistance.

42411103,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giC8mm,1658170698,Russian Activists Turn to Crypto for Donations to Aid Ukraine Refugees,"“There was a woman that arrived in a bathrobe.”  Alexander Shmelev was describing a refugee who drove 30 hours to Pristaniste, the shelter in Budva, Montenegro, he opened on March 5, about two weeks after Russia invaded Ukraine.  The woman lived 2,445 kilometers (1,500 miles) away in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, Shmelev said. “When the shelling started, she just grabbed her son, jumped in a car and drove all the way to us.”  The shelter consists of three multifamily homes where around 78 refugees from Ukraine, Russia and Belarus can get some rest and decide what they want to do next: either move to a different country or become legal residents in Montenegro and stay longer.  Since Shmelev and his wife Svetlana, both well-known Russian activists and educators, opened the shelter, the project has been in constant need of funding. The new charity project initially did not have a bank account in Montenegro, so the Shmelevs decided to start a cryptocurrency fundraiser.  By the time Pristaniste (named after the Serbian word for “refugee”) finalized the paperwork and got its bank account on June 26, over $50,000 has been raised already – in crypto. CoinDesk spoke to a number of similar projects helping refugees in several countries that are using crypto as an additional channel of funding.  These projects are the underdogs of the charity world, and their founders often face unwelcoming treatment abroad and retaliation from their home country – Russia. Since the war started and Russians got cut off from the global payment systems as a result of sanctions, crypto has become the fastest way to help people across borders.  The main convenience of crypto for volunteers helping refugees is that it’s immediately available to send and receive, while bank accounts abroad, especially for organizations, are not, and take time and paperwork to obtain, as Shmelev’s experience illustrates.  For some, crypto is also safer than fiat donations: Russians who want to help Ukrainians face political threats at home, where such help might be recognized as treason – and with bank transfers, any donation can be immediately traced back to the donor.  Home for all  After the invasion, millions of Ukrainians started fleeing the country. Many Russians felt unsafe at home, too.  Intensifying repression of independent journalists, activists and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), severe censorship and the rumors of a coming nationwide war mobilization led hundreds of Russians to seek refuge in Turkey, Armenia, Georgia and other countries. Everywhere they went, they met refugees from the other side.  These two types of involuntary migrants sometimes share the same shelters, supported by the same teams of volunteers who are trying to build safe homes from scratch, with limited to no resources and no help from the local authorities.  Pristaniste raised crypto via Coinbase’s payment platform, Coinbase Commerce, and the crypto crowdfunding website Heo.Finance. According to the data on Heo.Finance, Pristaniste managed to raise over $43,500 in various cryptos since this spring. An additional $10,000 has been raised in a separate campaign to provide education for refugees’ children in Montenegro.  Overall, crypto donations by early July exceeded $53,000, twice as much as the $21,000 raised in fiat. However, since Pristaniste opened a Montenegro bank account on June 26 and started a campaign on GoFundMe, the inflow of crypto donations slowed down quite a bit, Shmelev said. But for Russians who do not have a foreign bank account, crypto is still the only way to donate a small sum, not worth the high fees an interbank SWIFT transfer would require.  “We used to think we better put Ukrainians and Russians in separate homes but then the first couple that stayed with us was a mixed one,” Shmelev said. “In the end, there is no separation, and there have been no conflicts.”  One family that stayed at the shelter and left some time ago wrote to Shmelev, “it’s a strange time when close ones become strangers and strangers become family,” he recalled.  Along with Ukrainians, Pristaniste hosts refugees from Belarus who participated in the 2020 protests and fled the country fearing repression, as well as Russian journalists and activists avoiding police raids, harassment and jail time at home.  “Another group is young men that can be conscripted to the military [in Russia] due to their age and their parents don’t want them to go to war,” Shmelev said. “Sometimes, parents don’t go themselves but send their sons here.”  Read Also: ​​Belarus Nonprofit Helps Protestors With Bitcoin Grants  Donations for unbanked  For Russian citizens, the situation was made worse by the fact that their own bank accounts in Russia are no longer accessible from abroad due to the sanctions the EU and the U.S. imposed on Russia. Visa and Mastercard stopped processing payments from Russia-issued debit cards, and ​​major global payment systems, such as Western Union, Wise, Remitly and MoneyGram, stopped serving Russian users.  Read also: Crypto Becomes Lifeline for Russian Emigrés Opposing Putin’s War in Ukraine  Motskhaleba Foundation (the name means “mercy” in Georgian) started with a bot on the Telegram messaging app and a small team of volunteers connected online. Now a team of over 30 Russians, Ukrainians and Belarussians living in Tbilisi are getting ready to welcome about 25 refugees from Ukraine in a house the foundation rented so that the refugees get a break to catch their breath and plan their next steps toward a peaceful life.  The foundation is not registered as an official NGO yet. However, since May, the team managed to raise about $4,900 (28,300 Georgian lari) and rent a house, according to a makeshift financial report the team published in late July. Most of the funds are now coming via the personal bank account of the founder, a Moscow-born freelance journalist named Yulia Kosheliaeva, who relocated to Georgia this spring.  Bank transfers are not always the optimal way, she said: “Sometimes, people from other countries ask how to send us money, and we suggest a SWIFT transfer, but they say, ‘Are you crazy? Most of my donation is going to be eaten by fees!’”  For the Volunteers of Tbilisi, another organization in Georgia helping refugees with housing and everyday supplies, crypto provided 7% to 10% of all donations, said volunteer Sasha Khalipova. The organization has been receiving USDT, the stablecoin designed to hold its value against the U.S. dollar, on the Tron blockchain (where fees tend to be lower than other networks USDT runs on). The wallet receives small donations of 10 to 50 USDT every few days. Occasionally larger sums of 250 or more USDT come in. Since April 7, the wallet received over 60 transactions and about $9,200 in USDT, according to the data on Tronscan, a block explorer site.  For some volunteers, the donations were their first experience with crypto, and it proved sometimes confusing: For example, Koshelyaeva of Motskhaleba said the team was first advised by friends to use USDT and another stablecoin, USDC, on the Solana blockchain. Some surprised crypto donors asked for more “mainstream” options, and the team added the two most popular cryptocurrencies, bitcoin and ether.  For Russians for Ukraine, a volunteer organization in Poland helping the refugees crossing the Ukrainian border on the west, crypto is like a piggy bank for a rainy day, said George Nurmanov, the founder who himself fled Russia fearing political repressions.  Russians for Ukraine is renting a house near the Polish border in Przemysl so it can maintain a constant presence at the local train station, refugee center and at the pedestrian border crossing. The group helps refugees buy tickets, find shelter and communicate with the Polish cashiers at the railway stations. The volunteers’ house in Medyka, the Polish village right at the border, also serves as a temporary home for humanitarian supplies and people delivering them to Ukraine.  “People were asking me about crypto, so I opened those wallets,” Nurmanov said, adding that donations via PayPal and GoFundMe can sometimes get stuck between the service and a user’s account if a platform decides to freeze an account or if it just takes too long to transfer the money. At this point, only a small number of donations has hit Russians for Ukraine’s crypto wallets.  Silent protest  There is another reason crypto might be preferable for Russians willing to help Ukrainians, said Vlad, a volunteer for Ethos, a fund created by Russian expats that helps refugees rent apartments in Armenia and gives away things like medicine and hygiene products. Ethos is raising money in bitcoin, ether, tron, BNB and USDT. According to the blockchain data, so far, about $1,100 in USDT has been raised.  “For Russian citizens, sending money to help Ukrainians might not be safe,” Vlad said.  During the first week of the war, on Feb. 27, Russia’s office of attorney general warned in its official Telegram channel against helping a foreign state or organizations whose activities are “directed against the safety of Russia.” Such help can qualify as high treason, the post said. Earlier in July, the Federal Security Service’s armed squad paid a visit to the apartment of a Russian citizen who made donations to the fund supporting Ukraine’s army. He was told on camera that such actions can be classified as treason and asked if that was clear to him.  There are no known cases of people being punished for supporting humanitarian cases. However, Russian legal experts warn against using personal bank accounts for helping Ukrainians in any form, as there is no certainty about what can be classified a crime next, and bank transfers are easily traceable. Crypto, on the other hand, offers more ways for anonymity – although never a complete one.  Read also: Buying Bitcoin Anonymously (More or Less)  Koshelyaeva says that she and her team expect Russians to be main donors to Motskhaleba.  “We know that many people who left Russia [after the war began] do care about what’s going on, and it’s important for them to show they disagree” with the government’s actions. “For some, donating money is the only available way to protest against the war and support Ukrainians. Many Russians come to us asking how to send us money,” Koshelyaeva said.  Speaking up against the war in Ukraine became illegal in Russia soon after the war started: Under the new law, opposing the Russian army's actions might lead to up to 15 years in jail. On July 8, a member of the Moscow municipal council, Aleksei Gorinov, was sentenced to seven years in prison for speaking against the war during the council’s session.  “To help financially in this horrendous situation is a little something people can do,” Koshelyaeva said.",POSITIVE,USDT,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | USDT,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/07/18/russian-activists-turn-to-crypto-for-donations-to-aid-ukraine-refugees,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9cd1c68cac6b0a3475095cdaff6c1b616898b28a-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The President’s Working Group on Financial Markets, which recommended last year that stablecoins belong inside the regulated banking industry, didn’t mean to be overly rigid about how crypto firms might hit that mark, Liang said Monday at a Financial Services Forum event in Washington.  “There’s some flexibility under that framework,” she told reporters after speaking at the forum. “It’s meant to be open. It was not meant to limit to current banks.”  While the Treasury and the regulators in the working group want all stablecoin issuers to be regulated for safety and soundness, just like regular banks are, she said they shouldn’t have to have depository insurance and could be subsidiaries or affiliates of bank holding companies.  “What we wanted to do was bring it into the banking system,” she said. “Banking system – not necessarily deposit insurance.”  Issuers of the tokens, which designed for stability by being tied to assets such as the dollar, can’t be overseen only for the quality of their reserves, Liang said; they need a new regulatory structure from Congress.  Negotiations in Congress, which Treasury has been involved in, are still in the early stages, though a potential bill in the House Financial Services Committee has leaned toward setting up rules for both banks and nonbanks, according to people familiar with the talks.  “These are more than money market funds,” Liang said of stablecoin issuers, and so they need novel regulations that deal with them as payments companies, too.

42411753,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfgln,1658169050,Proof-of-Work vs. Proof-of-Stake: What Is the Difference?,"If you're new to the world of cryptocurrency, you probably have heard of both proof-of-stake and proof-of-work. These two concepts are essential to cryptocurrency transactions and security. They are key components of blockchain technology and how it works.  Proof-of-stake and proof-of-work are known as consensus mechanisms. Both, in different ways, help ensure users are honest with transactions, through incentivizing good actors and making it extremely difficult and expensive for bad actors. This reduces fraud such as double spending.  To understand what the difference is between proof-of-work vs. proof-of-stake, it helps to know a bit about mining.  In proof-of-work, verifying cryptocurrency transactions is done through mining. In proof of stake, validators are chosen based on a set of rules depending on the ""stake"" they have in the blockchain, meaning how much of that token they commit to locking up to have a chance to be chosen as a validator. In either case, the cryptocurrencies are designed to be decentralized and distributed, which means that transactions are visible to and verified by computers worldwide.  Read more: How Does Bitcoin Mining Work?  Computers on the network have to agree on what happened to verify transactions. If a computer tries to manipulate or commit fraudulent transactions on a network, it will be known through the public, immutable nature of the blockchain. Both consensus mechanisms have economic consequences that penalize malicious actors who try to disrupt the network.  Proof-of-work vs. proof-of-stake: Which is better?  Proof of work is a competition between miners to solve cryptographic puzzles and validate transaction in order to earn block rewards. Proof of stake implements randomly chosen validators to make sure the transaction is reliable, compensating them in return with crypto. Each choice has unique advantages and disadvantages.  Downsides of proof-of-work  Proof-of-work requires a significant amount of energy to verify transactions. Since the computers on the network must spend a lot of energy and operate a lot, the blockchain is less environmentally friendly than other systems.  Another problem some raise is that because of the competition between miners for rewards, a small number of mining pools control the blockchain, a kind of de-facto centralization. It is important to note though that mining pools are made up of individual miners or smaller groups of miners who are free to pull their hashpower if they no longer agree with the direction of the larger mining pool.     Downsides of proof-of-stake  The main issue with proof-of-stake is that it requires an often enormous initial investment. You must purchase enough of the native token of that cryptocurrency to qualify to be a validator, which is dependent on the size of the network. In theory, people must be wealthy or earn enough money to buy a network stake, leading to an exclusively rich blockchain. As cryptocurrencies rise in market value, this issue could become worse.  Read more: Will a Proof-of-Stake Ethereum Lead to More Centralization?  Final words: Which one should you choose?  Proof-of-stake and proof-of-work both have pros and cons, and it's important to acknowledge that no system is perfect. Every system has its strengths and weaknesses, and which one you think is better ultimately depends on your point of view.

42422712,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0p0lh,1658168930,Celsius Bankruptcy Filings Hint Retail Customers Will Bear Brunt of Its Failure,"Liquidity-strapped crypto lender Celsius Network filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the Southern District of New York on Wednesday, more than a month after it halted customer withdrawals because of “extreme market conditions.”  The filing came nine days after crypto broker Voyager Digital filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the same court, after it paused customer withdrawals earlier this month as it faced its own liquidity crisis triggered by the collapse of Singapore-based crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital.  Court filings revealed that Celsius has a $1.2 billion hole (at minimum) in its balance sheet – the company has $5.5 billion in liabilities ($4.7 billion of which represents customer holdings) and only $4.3 billion in assets, much of which is illiquid. Though the company has already begun to make good on its debt to institutional creditors, retail investors have been left in the dark and will likely bear the brunt of Celsius’ failing.  “Celsius has set the stage for conflict between its customers and its sophisticated institutional creditors,” Daniel Gwen, a business restructuring associate at New York-based law firm Ropes & Gray, told CoinDesk.  “In particular, Celsius has pointed out in its pleadings that customers transferred ownership of crypto assets to Celsius, making those customers unsecured creditors. This detail may undercut customer expectations, who thought they were depositing their assets into a construct similar to a traditional bank,” Gwen added.  David Silver, a founding partner of the Florida-based law firm Silver Miller, agreed.  “Celsius is the dangerous result of what happens in an unregulated marketplace. People who thought they were investing in low-risk investments and had withdrawn their crypto from high-risk investments just lost a generation of wealth,” he told CoinDesk. “For the moment, the bankruptcy process will not be the average investor's friend.”  Not your keys, not your coins  Much like Voyager Digital, Celsius looked a lot like a bank to average investors.  Customers could connect their credit cards or bank accounts to the platform, and use it to buy and trade crypto, or to take out fiat loans against their crypto assets. To entice customers to stake their crypto with Celsius, the company promised returns of up to 17%.  Read more: Behind Voyager’s Fall: Crypto Broker Acted Like a Bank, Went Bankrupt  But, as several lawyers pointed out to CoinDesk, neither Celsius nor Voyager is a bank, and neither is subject to the same stringent regulations that banks are.  This is evident in both lenders’ decision to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Often called “reorganization bankruptcy,” Chapter 11 bankruptcy allows businesses to keep operating while they restructure their finances in order to pay back their creditors.  It’s an option that isn’t available to broker-dealers. When regulated securities or commodities brokers go bankrupt, their only option is to liquidate, usually through Chapter 7 bankruptcy.  Rick Hyman, a New York-based partner in Crowell & Moring’s corporate and financial services groups, told CoinDesk that Celsius’ and Voyager’s ability to restructure through Chapter 11 rather than be forced to liquidate is a result of the lack of regulatory clarity surrounding cryptocurrencies.  “While there has been much discussion regarding the nature of digital assets and whether they should be deemed securities or commodities, and the [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission] has expressed some views on the subject, no such determination has been made,” Hyman said. “Unless and until that determination is made, cryptocurrency platforms like Celsius Network and Voyager will not be classified as broker-dealers.”  Bankrupt in the Big Apple  Though Voyager is based in New York and filed for bankruptcy in the Southern District of New York, Celsius’ decision to file in the same court has caused some confusion, because Celsius’ headquarters are in Hoboken, N.J.  In its court filings, Celsius listed a New York address as a location for its principal assets, which Gwen told CoinDesk is another method for determining bankruptcy venue or jurisdiction.  Aaron Javian, a partner at New York law firm Reed Smith, told CoinDesk it’s actually quite common for companies based outside New York to file for bankruptcy in the city.  “There typically is a significant nexus that companies have to New York because of its status as a financial center. If [Celsius] has got cash or crypto or whatever that’s held through accounts that are in New York, then there’s likely a significant asset and business reason to file in the SDNY.”  One of those reasons could be that the Southern District of New York is perceived as a friendlier – or at least more crypto-savvy – jurisdiction.  “Many large commercial debtors are able to file bankruptcy in a district that has a particular expertise in their industry and a reputation for conducting efficient proceedings,” Hyman told CoinDesk. “[Celsius] may have determined that it would be favorable to have the same court, although not the same judge [as Voyager] address the many novel issues that are certain to arise in these high-profile cases.”  New York’s bankruptcy judges are widely considered to be some of the most sophisticated in the U.S., because of their experience in dealing with complex financial bankruptcies.  “New York, for example, was home for the bankruptcy cases of Lehman Brothers and the Bernie Madoff investment fund,” Gwen said.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/07/18/celsius-bankruptcy-filings-hint-retail-customers-will-bear-brunt-of-its-failure,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5e20bbdfbc71cc3ca03d71dc65dd442f20cba485-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Digital Currency Group, parent of both Genesis and CoinDesk, has assumed the entire $1.2 billion claim, leaving Genesis with no outstanding liabilities tied to Three Arrows Capital.  The filing indicates that Genesis Asia Pacific Pte. Ltd., a subsidiary of Genesis Global, sought relief from Three Arrows regarding assets of $1.14 billion, as well as pledged AVAX and NEAR tokens worth a total of $91.3 million, on June 15.  A list of creditor claims on the document reveals that Genesis Asia Pacific Pte. Ltd. made demands for breached Three Arrows Capital loans totaling $2.36 billion.  The loans were partly collateralized with 17.4 million shares of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), 446,928 shares in Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), 2.7 million AVAX tokens and 13.9 million NEAR tokens – all of which have been liquidated by Genesis.  Genesis issued a margin call to Three Arrows Capital via the American Arbitration Association seeking collateral to make up the shortfall. When Three Arrows failed to provide the required collateral, Genesis sent a notice of default, stating that the entire loan balance was due.

70221,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=495991,1658161807,A New Asset Class of Digital Investment,"The digital realm has become an integral part of our daily lives. It has brought investments closer to the people, as they have become simpler and more accessible. Consequently, financial instruments such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and ETFs have undergone rapid digital transformation. The landscape has undergone an evolution with the advent of blockchain, which is heralding a new era of digital investments: crypto-assets. Cryptocurrencies originated with bitcoin, the world’s first decentralized, peer-to-peer money, in 2009. While the fundamental idea behind bitcoin was to establish a safe and anonymous mechanism to transfer funds, people also recognized its potential as a store of value. Crypto-assets are expanding fast and have reached a market valuation of over $1.03 trillion in about twelve years. The industry even clocked an all-time high of $3 trillion in November 2021. Following an initial boom that saw Ethereum and its smart contract platform rival bitcoin in popularity, other cryptocurrencies (altcoins) began flooding the market enormously, offering security, exponential industry growth, outsized returns, inflation hedge, and portfolio diversification. While crypto has gained popularity as a digital investment, some overlook the utility and purpose factors, which have caught the attention of many. More than Just a Digital Investment Unlike traditional stocks, holding crypto-assets provides actual utility: individuals can stake their tokens for rewards, as well as participate in yield farming to earn lucrative interest rates, governance, and can even solve real-world problems effectively. The rarest and most valuable combination, however, is a cryptocurrency with utility, a solid purpose, and the potential to be a reliable investment. The Legacy Token by Nature’s Vault checks all these boxes. Nature’s Vault is a fintech-slash-greentech company tokenizing and monetizing the preservation of gold deposits underground. The company’s goal is to facilitate ESG impact and natural capital investment, offering new ways to invest in the future of our planet through various projects, beginning with Legacy Token. The token not only serves a purpose but also provides utilities for holders, such as the ability to stake it to earn yields and vote on governance. Legacy: The Token with a Purpose As the token’s main utility is the preservation of in-ground gold deposits, each Legacy Token is backed by the preservation of at least 1/100th of a gram of gold in the ground. Nature’s Vault acquires the mining rights for deposits located in pristine environments that are vulnerable to mining, and makes a pledge to never mine the gold within these deposits. In the process, they protect such environments from being mined by other parties as well. The first deposit Nature’s Vault acquired lies near Pistol Lake in Canada and covers over 150 thousand ounces of gold. With Legacy Token, the tokenization of in-ground gold is intended to provide an alternative to traditional gold investments which require mining the gold with a significant environmental cost. Legacy Token offers the benefits of gold investment but without the environmental harm of gold mining, thus incentivizing avoided mining as a sound financial investment. Token holders can look at Legacy Token as an environmentally friendly way of diversifying their investment portfolio. There is even the possibility that in the near future, carbon credits may be generated through avoided mining, and these credits could be distributed to Legacy Token holders.. Legacy Token, therefore, provides ESG investment opportunities for both individual and institutional token holders, while also contributing to the safeguarding of the Earth’s Natural Capital and helping mitigate climate change. Another attractive feature of Legacy Token as an investment is Nature’s Vault’s Mine Acquisition Program. The aforementioned deposit near Pistol Lake holds 150 thousand ounces of gold, but Nature’s Vault is committing to the preservation of at least another 850 thousand ounces of gold through the acquisition of additional deposits. The company’s goal is to commit to the preservation of at least one million ounces of gold, at which point each Legacy Token would be backed by approximately sixfold the amount of preserved gold from the time of launch. Powering the Future of Investments with Utilities The world is transitioning away from traditional investment methods and toward the digital era of engagements. Investments that were previously difficult to visualize, explain, and elicit emotions are now simple to comprehend. Also, thanks to blockchain technology for facilitating the creation of cryptocurrencies which is the future of digital investments. With tokens like Legacy serving a purpose while also delivering utility, crypto is undoubtedly poised to be the next best thing in digital investments. It’s about time the world embraces crypto en masse, particularly the ones that promote a bigger cause for the betterment of humanity.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | ICO | MINING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/company/a-new-asset-class-of-digital-investment/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

For crypto firms that want to offer services in the Netherlands, they must register with the De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) under the Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Prevention Act, as per the release. The DNB, which previously disclosed a public warning about Binance in August 2021, increased its penalty from 2M euros due to the vast size of Binance as well as its ""very large number of customers"" in the country, the release said. The world's largest crypto exchange by trading volume objected to the charge on June 2, the DNB said. On the other hand, the DNB noted that Binance has submitted for registration in a move that has enabled the central bank to moderate the fine by 5%. Over the past year, the company has taken steps to expand its global footprint while aiming to comply with regulations. Its Moon Tech subsidiary, for example, had secured registration as a virtual asset services provider (VASP) at the beginning of July. “Today’s decision marks a long-awaited pivot in our ongoing collaboration with the Dutch Central Bank,” a spokesperson told CNBC via email . “While we do not share the same view on every aspect of the decision, we deeply respect the authority and professionalism of Dutch regulators to enforce regulations as they see fit.” As a testament to Binance's size, it has just exceeded rival Coinbase Global ( COIN ) for having the most bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) of any exchange, according to a Twitter post by Blockware Solutions analyst Will Clemente.

The second crypto by market cap has seen bullish momentum on the back of a potential full transition to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus. The date for this event was announced two days ago. Related Reading | TA: Ethereum Outpaces Bitcoin, Why ETH Could Rise To $1,500 This process will be completed with “The Merge”, an event set for September 19, 2022, with the objective of combining Ethereum’s execution layer with its consensus layer. ETH core developers have successfully carried out this process on the network’s main testnet. As uncertainty around “The Merge” mitigates, crypto investors, grow increasingly bullish. At the time of writing, Ethereum (ETH) trades at $1,480 with a 10% profit in the last 24 hours and a 27% profit in the past week. In the crypto top 10 by market cap, only ETH’s price records such an increase. Bitcoin records a 7% profit in the past week, while XRP and Solana record a 12% and 15% profit over the same period. Data from Material Indicators shows liquidity for the ETH/USDT trading pair has been trending upwards with the price of the cryptocurrency. When ETH’s price broke above $1,350 it was able to quickly move into the $1,400 area. This suggests that $1,300 has been flipped from resistance to support making it a key level in case of future downside price action. As seen below, bids have been moving up with ETH’s price with over $7 million buy orders at around $1,450 hinting at sustainable bullish price action. Analyst Ali Martinez believes ETH printed a bullish four-hour candlestick when it broke below $1,300. At that time, the cryptocurrency broke from a multi-month consolidation gaining enough momentum to reclaim levels above $1,650. The analyst believes ETH’s price is heading towards this area with the potential to hit $1,670. The next area to watch if ETH sees follow through into this area is $1,700. Why The $1,700 Are Important For The Price Of Ethereum? Additional data provided by JarvisLabs hints at an important shift in Ethereum market dynamics. The cryptocurrency saw a flipped in its 30-day returns, used to measure the short-term profit and loss for crypto investors in this period. This metric has been trending towards 0% after moving in negative territory for multiple months. According to Jarvis Labs, a flip above 0% for Ethereum’s 30D returns could present investors with a selling opportunity.

42422723,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0p15h,1658157483,Options Signal Ether Strength for First Time in 6 Months,"Ether's options market flipped bullish on Monday, showing a bias for strength in Ethereum's native token for the first time in over six months.  The six-month put-call skew, which measures the cost of puts (bearish bets) relative to calls (bullish bets), slipped below zero and fell to -4%, the lowest figure since Jan. 3, data provided by analytics platform Skew shows.  The negative turn indicates that the premium paid by call buyers in return for protection against upside moves over six months is now greater than the cost paid by put buyers for insurance against bearish moves.  The one-week, one- and three-month put-call skews have seen a similar drop below zero, also their first since early January, in a sign of renewed relatively stronger demand for short-term and medium-term bullish bets.  The change in sentiment validates ether's ongoing rally, supposedly triggered by developers recently announcing Sept. 19 as a tentative date for the completion of Ethereum's long-awaited transition from the proof-of-work consensus mechanism to the proof-of-stake mechanism.  Ether (ETH) topped $1,500 early Monday, hitting its highest level since June 12, according to CoinDesk data. The cryptocurrency has gained 35% in seven days, outperforming bitcoin's 11% rise by a wide margin.  The impending network upgrade, dubbed the ""Merge"" or Ethereum 2.0, promises to make ether a deflationary currency and Ethereum an environmentally friendly smart contract blockchain.  ""At this point, some traders are buying large amounts of call options (usually expiring within a week) and buying the underlying [asset] in the spot market,"" Griffin Ardern, volatility trader from crypto asset management firm Blofin, said.  ""To hedge their risk, options market makers [who sold calls to investors] need to buy spot or go long futures, which will push prices up further quickly when liquidity is insufficient,"" Ardern added.  Options market makers are entities entrusted with ensuring healthy liquidity levels on exchanges. Market makers are usually on the opposite side of investors' trades and run a direction-neutral exposure by constantly buying and selling the underlying assetin spot/derivatives markets.",POSITIVE,ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/07/18/options-signal-ether-strength-for-first-time-in-6-months,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d9de782e1036cb35b2bb5c658b315f89994c5d58-2616x1252.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Ether jumped over 10%, adding to a nearly 30% weekly rally. Bitcoin rose 4.5% to trade over $22,200 for the first time in nearly two weeks. Cardano’s ADA added 9.9%, Solana’s SOL rose 6.5%, and BNB and XRP each added nearly 5%.  Total crypto market capitalization regained the $1 trillion mark, adding 4.5% in the past 24 hours. The figure previously fell to under $800 billion in June amid contagion risks in the crypto market.  Among major cryptocurrencies with more than a $1 billion market cap, Polygon’s MATIC tokens soared 16%, and Bored Apes Yacht Club ecosystem token APE jumped 20% on separate catalysts. The MATIC came as project developers teased an upcoming upgrade involving Ethereum. That added to momentum from last week’s announcement of the project being chosen as one of six companies for Disney’s accelerator program. The moves added to MATIC's nearly 60% price gains over the past week. The tokens have increased over 126% in the past month, becoming one of the top performing cryptos in the period.  APE surged as developers revealed the first look of the platform's upcoming Otherside metaverse on Twitter to generally positive responses. Community members appreciated the gameplay and realism, with the game demo seemingly handling more than 4,500 participants simultaneously. APE prices rose from $4.38 last week to over $6 on Monday, a gain of nearly 40%.  Some traders suggested a local bottom could be in for the broader cryptocurrency sector.  “The crypto market has seen a relief rally despite last week’s news regarding the latest inflation data,” said Marcus Sotiriou, an analyst at crypto broker GlobalBlock.  “Headline CPI (consumer price index) in the U.S. for June was 9.1% year-over-year, well above the median forecast of 8.8% and the highest since 1981. This is another blow to economic and social well-being, as the Federal Reserve is forced to be more aggressive,"" he said.  ""However, bitcoin has risen by over 10% since the news, and ethereum has climbed by almost 40%. When the market starts reacting positively to negative news, this signals that a local bottom could be in for now, as fear may have caused the news to be priced in,” Sotiriou explained.  Inflation tracked by the U.S. CPI rose 9.1% in June, accelerating from May's 8.6% pace to a fresh 40-year high, and exceeding economists' expectations. That led to concerns that the Federal Reserve may become even more aggressive in tightening monetary policy to tamp down prices.",POSITIVE,MATIC,BTC | ETH | MARKET | MATIC | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/07/18/polygon-apecoin-tokens-see-outsized-gains-amid-majors-recovery,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b994a84a779747f15b1d7667ec9a74879a7dc8e0-1683x1262.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42422725,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0p19h,1658151637,"First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Has Best Day in a Month, but Ether’s Getting Even More Love","Good morning, and welcome to First Mover. I’m Lyllah Ledesma, here to take you through the latest in crypto markets, news and insights.  Price Point: Crypto markets were suddenly looking bullish on Monday as bitcoin had its best day of the year, and ether, the second-biggest cryptocurrency, posted even bigger gains, amid speculation that a rally might be in the making ahead of the Ethereum network’s upcoming ""Merge.""  Market Moves: Omkar Godbole looks at the Merge's market impact in depth and ETH's staked derivative on Lido finance called stETH.  This web version of today's First Mover newsletter was produced by Sage D. Young.  Price Point  Bitcoin (BTC) was trading up 5% on the day, hitting its highest level in over a month. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has not traded above $22,000 since June 16, 2022.  BTC traded as low as $18,800 last week and has made significant gains since, trading up 11% over the last seven days.  But the big story of the day in crypto markets was ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, which is picking up momentum in advance of a big upgrade now expected in September.  Ether has accelerated its rally Monday morning, outperforming bitcoin, perhaps an indication that the market is starting to take the network’s upcoming “Merge” seriously.  ETH was trading up 10% over the last 24-hours at $1,477. On Friday, a member of the Ethereum community tweeted an outline of dates for the long-awaited Merge and prior events. The Merge is set to take place on Sept. 19, 2022.  “The upcoming Merge is definitely a case for the hype in ETH,” said Laurent Kssis, head of Europe at crypto asset manager Hashdex. Kssis noted that short ETH liquidations were triggering buy orders which also accelerated the positive price movement.  Over the last seven days there has been a general catch up for altcoins, with Polygon’s MATIC up 62%, AVAX by 37% and NEAR by 24%.  In traditional markets, U.S. stock futures rose after Goldman Sachs posted a stronger-than-expected second quarter profit. Futures tied to the S&P 500 rose 1.1%, and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures added 1% while technology-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures gained 1.3%.  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Polygon MATIC +17.8% Smart Contract Platform Avalanche AVAX +12.0% Smart Contract Platform Ethereum ETH +10.5% Smart Contract Platform  Biggest Losers  There are no losers in CoinDesk 20 today.  Market Moves  By Omkar Godbole  Renewed clarity about the timeline of programmable blockchain Ethereum's highly-anticipated ""Merge"" upgrade, dubbed Ethereum 2.0, seems to have galvanized investor interest in ether and its staked derivative on Lido finance called stETH, offering a reprieve to the battered cryptocurrencies.  On Thursday, the Ethereum Foundation member Tim Beiko suggested Sept. 19 as the provisional launch date for the Merge, which will see the world's biggest smart contract blockchain transition from the energy-intensive proof-of-work consensus mechanism to a more environment-friendly proof-of-stake mechanism.  Since Beiko's announcement, ether has rallied roughly 22%, hitting a one-month high of $1,475, according to CoinDesk data. The token registered a 15% gain in the seven days to July 17, the biggest jump since March.  The staked ether's discount relative to the price of ether has narrowed to 0.98 from 0.96 since Thursday, per data source CoinMarketCap. The token representing an equivalent amount of ether staked in Lido Finance is supposed to trade at a price closer to ether. stETH's price fell into a discount of 0.93 to ETH following the collapse of Terra in May and has not been able to recover since. Lido Finance is a liquid staking protocol allowing users to stake coins while retaining liquidity and bypassing the burden of owning a minimum of 32 ETH to become a staker. Users can redeem staked ETH for ETH only after transfers are enabled on Ethereum 2.0.  ""ETH has undergone a rapid change in narrative over the past week with speculators purely focused on the upcoming 'Merge' as a catalyst for appreciation,"" said Matthew Dibb, COO and co-founder of Stack Funds. ""Adding to this, we believe that there is a significant amount of sidelined capital that has been waiting on bullish momentum to establish new positions.""  Several observers consider Ethereum's impending transition equivalent to three bitcoin halvings – a programmed code that halves the per block BTC supply every four years – and leading to a 90% reduction in ether's annual issuance. Simply put, the transition is likely to bring a store of value or deflationary appeal to ether. The upgrade has been long pending.  Like other market participants, ether investors tend to factor in bullish developments in advance. For instance, ether rallied over 60% to $2,800 in the three weeks leading up to the London hard fork, or code modification, implemented on Aug. 5, 2021. The hard fork activated a mechanism to burn the portion of fees paid to miners.  The Ethereum 2.0 upgrade has been long overdue and has seen several delays. However, the recent successful merges of the Ropsten and Sepolia testnets and the Goerli testnet's planned transition to proof-of-stake on for Aug. 11 has raised hopes for the mainnet merge in September.

42422719,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0p11h,1658151484,"Stablecoin Bill Won’t Force All Issuers to Be Banks, Congressman Says","Congress may rebuff U.S. regulators who wanted stablecoins to be the exclusive territory of banks, according to a lawmaker familiar with a legislative effort now in motion.  Democrats on the House Financial Services Committee have been working on requirements that may not be as restrictive as the Treasury Department and financial regulators had requested. The bill is expected to allow a path for nonbank firms to become government-approved stablecoin issuers, said Rep. Jim Himes, (D-Conn.), who is a senior member of the committee and one of its subcommittee chairmen but isn’t working directly on the legislation.  Some lawmakers have already openly predicted that it’s possible to get a bill out soon that sets rules of the road for stablecoins – a vital component of today’s cryptocurrency markets. But such a bill requires action from House Democrats.  “Apparently, we'll have options for both banks and non banks,” Himes told CoinDesk in an interview. He said Chairwoman Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) and the ranking Republican on the committee, Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), have been working together on a narrow, stablecoins-only bill, and it’s expected to establish “standards for reserves” for more than one kind of issuer.  That concession could run counter to last year’s report from the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets that recommended the tokens only be offered by “insured depository institutions, which are subject to appropriate supervision and regulation.”  Stablecoins, including dollar-tied tokens such as Tether’s USDT and Circle Internet Financial’s USD coin (USDC), are meant to offer a stable means of moving in and out of more volatile cryptocurrencies, but for financial watchdogs fearful of runs, they also represent crypto’s most alarming sector.  While the details of the legislation may not match one of the central requests from regulators, the working group also asked that “Congress act promptly to enact legislation” – an apparent aim of the committee leaders.  “There is broad agreement that legislation is necessary,” McHenry said in an emailed statement, adding that the “best way to get this done” is in a bipartisan approach similar to the crypto bill he introduced late last year.  In recent months, Republican lawmakers have argued against keeping stablecoins entirely boxed into banking. A proposal from Sen. Patrick Toomey (R-Pa.) suggested a new federal license just for stablecoin issuers who could do that business alongside traditional depository institutions, and McHenry contended earlier this year that “requiring stablecoins to only be issued by banks would be a major obstacle for us continuing to foster innovation.”  It’s unclear exactly how the current House bill would allow for nonbank stablecoin issuers, and people familiar with the effort say negotiations remain underway among lawmakers, so the details are still being worked out. Meanwhile, the Biden administration is trying to encourage speed.  Treasury officials have been working with Congress, but a department spokesman said he couldn’t comment on the discussions.  Last month, both Toomey and McHenry suggested a stablecoin bill could be completed this year – an against-the-odds assertion that suggests some Republicans are willing to make deals to let a bipartisan bill through the evenly split Senate. A Biden administration official also told CoinDesk last month that legislation could be passed by the end of the year.  “The big question – always – is can you get 60 votes in the Senate?” Himes said, suggesting that Toomey’s support could help. Still, Himes said he’s been telling people that “there’s nothing legislatively coming out of this Congress.”  That would mean a stablecoin bill would have to wait for the next session, and an influx of new members that may shift the majority to the Republicans next year.  The historic trend for major financial legislation is that it’s often driven by a crisis. So far, U.S. regulators continue to argue that the damage being wrought in today’s crypto sector isn’t significant enough to threaten the rest of the financial system. Still, the terraUSD fiasco illustrated the costly vulnerabilities of certain stablecoins and lent energy to lawmakers, who are focusing more attention on the industry.  “It's actually been great to watch my colleagues on both sides of the aisle really kind of educate themselves on these issues,” said Himes, who has a background in finance as a former banker at Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. “Five years ago, if you'd said cryptocurrency, there'd be two people in this building who would know what the hell you're talking about.”  Dante Disparte, Circle’s chief strategy officer, released policy principles for stablecoins on Monday, insisting that it’s time for Washington to act.  “The preservation of bank and non-bank dollar digital currency issuance promotes competition, a level playing field, and rules-based upgrades in the financial system,” according to one of the company’s policy assertions.  “We have been engaged with Congress quite a bit,” Nellie Liang, Treasury’s undersecretary for domestic finance, said Monday about the discussions over stablecoin legislation. At a Financial Service Forum event in Washington, Liang — who said digital assets have a “potential to really fundamentally reform payments” — continued to argue that U.S. regulators can't properly oversee this sector without action from lawmakers.

The bulls successfully defended the $0.3 support and tried to reverse the trend by breaching above the crucial resistance. As the price has not fallen following a false breakout, this indicates that the bulls may be stronger than the bears. Thus, the volume has increased, which is a positive indicator. As of this writing, XRP is trading at $0.364, up 12% in the last seven days, data by Coingecko show, Monday. Suggested Reading | CEL Token Seen Making A Recovery Despite Celsius Going Bankrupt Image - The Coin Republic XRP Straight Green Candles Ripple has registered three consecutive green daily candles, and purchasers were able to increase the price by 15 percent till Friday evening. The primary concern, though, is whether this rally is sufficient enough to halt the intermediate-term bearish trend. On a daily scale, buyers drove the price towards the short-term horizontal resistance at $0.4, attempting for a third time to breach the key breakthrough. The 14-day RSI indicator entered positive territory and surged past the baseline at this time. This means that the bulls are now more dominant than they were previously. Ripple has not been able to achieve a higher daily high for a quite a long time. Since May this year, sellers have kept the bulls from surpassing the previous peak (in yellow). Imge - TradingView.com In order to begin a trend reversal, XRP must first establish a higher high above $0.4. In this instance, bearish momentum could eventually begin to diminish. The bulls should then barrel past the horizontal barrier between $0.50 and $0.55 (in blue) before retesting the falling trendline (in red). Overcoming the red static barrier that has been shading the price for a considerable amount of time might be a very bullish indicator for the token. Global Crypto Market Cap Up 1.35% According to data from CoinMarketCap at the time of writing, the worldwide market capitalization of cryptocurrencies increased by 1.35 percent during the previous 24 hours, reaching approximately $980 billion. XRP total market cap at $17.6 billion on the daily chart | Source: TradingView.com The 24-hour volume of the worldwide cryptocurrency market declined 1.7% to $61 billion, while the 24-hour volume of DeFi was $5.55 billion, representing 9.0% of the global crypto market. The volume of all stablecoins was $55.63 billion, or 90.72 percent of the 24-hour volume of the whole crypto market. Currently, XRP is seeing resistance at the 50-day moving average. If there is a breakthrough, it will mark the first time since March 9 this year. Prior to a potential reversal, however, the price must first consolidate above the key resistance between $0.48 and $0.52.

Binance’s Regulatory And Legal Trouble Continues According to an official statement from today, the fine was imposed because Binance was offering crypto services without the legally required registration, following a public warning issued against the company in August 2021. The bank further clarified that the crypto company had objected to the fine on June 2, 2022. Crypto companies in the Netherlands are obliged to register with DNB under the Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (Prevention) Act. While the DNB said it has not yet approved Binance’s registration, it did minimize the fine it had originally intended by 5 percent because the company has “been relatively transparent about its operations throughout the process.” DNB considered Binance’s status as the world’s largest provider of crypto services when determining the size of the monetary penalty, with a daily trading volume of $13.7 billion and a large customer base in the Netherlands. The DNB further saw that Binance enjoyed a competitive advantage because it did not pay any levies to the central bank and did not have to incur other costs in connection with ongoing supervision by the Dutch Central Bank. The violations took place over a long period – from 21 May 2020 until at least 1 December 2021, giving them another reason for the increased fine. DNB, therefore, considers these violations to be serious.

As reported last week, Celsius has $4.3 billion in reported assets which includes $600 million in the now depleted CEL token, as well as $5.5 billion in liabilities.  Among next steps, the company is hoping its sizable mining subsidiary can use minted bitcoin (BTC) to both grow its balance sheet and fund mining operations.  Celsius is also considering ""asset sales and third-party investment opportunities"" as a way to raise capital.  The company added that it will confirm a Chapter 11 plan that will provide customers an option of receiving a discounted cash settlement, or the option to remain ""long crypto,"" which could involve distributing CEL tokens.  The CEL token is currently trading at $0.80 with a market cap of $191 million, despite Celsius claiming that it owns $600 million worth of that native token.

62668,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/?p=243279,1658149242,QTUM Technical Analysis: Is This The Best Time To Buy Quantum?,"QTUM Price shows a consolidation range breakout and beats the 50-day SMA teasing a potential rally to the $3.61 mark. Will this rally reach the $4 mark? Key Technical Points: QTUM prices have increased by 5.23% in the last 24 hours. The price action shows a breakout rally beating the 50-day SMA. The 24-hour trading volume of Quantum is $115 Million, indicating a rise of 56.65%. Past Performance of QTUM As mentioned in our previous analysis, the QTUM prices were under a consolidation range ranging from $2.58 to $3.16. However, the recent bull cycle starting on 13 July accounts for a price jump of more than 20% and breaks overhead resistance along with the 50day SMA. However, the prices are yet to close above the consolidation range to signal a bullish breakout. Source – Tradingview QTUM Technical Analysis The QTUM price chart displays growth in buying pressure evident from the spike in intraday trading volume supporting the breakout candle. And traders hoping to ride the breakout rally can find a buying opportunity if the closing price exceeds the 50-day SMA. As the prices exceed the 50-day SMA, the possibility of a bull run to the overhead resistance of the 100-day SMA increases. Hence Traders can hold the breakout rally to jump 30% and exceed the $4 resistance level. The RSI indicator shows a sharp reversal from the nearly oversold zone, ready to reach the overboard boundary. Hence the indicator shows an increase in the underlying bullishness, increasing the likelihood of a high momentum breakout rally. The MACD indicator shows the fast and slow lines reemerging in a bullish alignment to approach the zero line with an increase in the positive histograms. Hence the momentum indicator shows an increase in buying pressure which supports the breakout theory. In a nutshell, QTUM technical analysis projects a high likelihood of a bullish trend continuation to the next opposing SMA. Upcoming Trend If the QTUM prices sustain about the 50-day SMA, traders can expect the bullish breakout rally to reach the $4 mark.

Over the past 24 hours, bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), the world's largest digital token by market cap, is climbing 3.2% to $22.05K and ethereum ( ETH-USD ) is jumping 8.9% to $1.47K as of shortly before 9:00 a.m. ET. In turn, bitcoin proxies like Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( OTC:GBTC ) +6.2% and ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITO ) +4.6% are catching a bid in premarket trading. Still, both coins are off well over 60% from their November 2021 peaks. As for the largest percentage winners among major cryptos during intraday trading, cardano ( ADA-USD ) +7.8% , polygon ( MATIC-USD ) +16.6% , avalanche ( AVAX-USD ) +9.3% and ethereum classic ( ETC-USD ) +17.7% all are experiencing relief. The crypto upswing comes as stock futures point to a higher open, with contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq ( NDX:IND ) +1.1% , S&P 500 ( SPX ) +0.8% and Dow Jones ( INDU ) +0.8% . Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), in particular, is up over 10% since headline consumer price inflation came in at a fresh 40-year high last week. ""When the market starts reacting positively to negative news, this is a signal that a local bottom could be in for now, as fear may have caused the news to be priced in,"" GlobalBlock analyst Marcus Sotiriou wrote in a note. While cryptos are seeing somewhat of a recovery, the move may not be a sustainable relief rally like most are hoping as financial contagion effects triggered by the collapse of algorithmic stablecoin TerraUST ( UST-USD ), crypto exchange Celsius and crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital keep spreading. “Given the severely negative performance in Q2, it is unsurprising that a ‘relief’ bounce has occurred.

The jury is still out, but it probably turned out to be a pretty big mistake. A number that was thrown around was 500 million XRP. And, of course, XRP is nearly perfectly liquid. 1/2 — 𝙳𝚊𝚟𝚒𝚍 𝚂𝚌𝚑𝚠𝚊𝚛𝚝𝚣 (@JoelKatz) July 18, 2022 Receiving XRP From Ripple Was Pointless According to the XRP Ledger’s creator, he might have gotten over 500 million tokens. The executive says that since he could easily purchase the coin on exchanges, receiving XRP from Ripple was pointless. The price of the XRP cryptocurrency is $0.36 right now. The cryptocurrency is currently down 89.27% from its all-time high, which was set back at the beginning of 2018. At the height of the XRP rise, Larsen’s net worth soared to $59.9 billion. According to Forbes, the co-net founder’s worth as of 2022 was only about $3 billion. 6.3% of the company is owned by CEO Brad Garlinghouse, who joined Ripple in April 2015, in addition to his “nine figures” personal XRP holdings. As per the XRP Scan data, McCaleb, who departed Ripple in 2014 after a disagreement with senior executives, finally spent all of his money on Sunday, ending an eight-year selling streak. Members of the community were happy to hear the news since it indicates that there will be less selling pressure on the token. Over eight years, McCaleb sold roughly 5% of the token’s total supply.

However, according to her, this process would not be possible without significant international collaboration. Global Collaboration Needed For Cryptocurrency Regulation According to a local media report from today, India’s finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman wrote a statement in response to five written questions from Thirumaavalavan Thol, a member of parliament. The questions included whether the RBI remains concerned over the impact of cryptocurrencies on the economy and whether there was any effective legislation to restrict its usage. “RBI has recommended for framing of legislation on this sector. RBI is of the view that cryptocurrencies should be prohibited. Cryptocurrencies are by definition borderless and require international collaboration to prevent regulatory arbitrage,” Sitharaman wrote. Sitharaman, however, seems to believe that a “global collaboration” is needed for any effective regulation or ban. “Therefore any legislation for regulation or for banning can be effective only after significant international collaboration on evaluation of the risks and benefits and evolution of common taxonomy and standards,” she added. The finance minister further told the Parliament that the RBI does not consider cryptocurrencies as actual currencies, as only central banks or governments can issue modern currency. Moreover, the value of cryptocurrencies rests solely on speculations, she added. As she pointed out, the expectations of high returns not being well anchored, she said, would have a “destabilizing effect on the monetary and fiscal stability of a country.” Sitharaman’s comments come as India’s adoption of a strict taxation regime with a 30% crypto tax, 1% TDS, and a potential 28% tax inclusion in the GST ambit.

Ether prices rose ahead of September’s expected Merge event. “Merge” refers to deploying Ethereum’s execution layer – the term for the current Ethereum network – to the “consensus layer” of the Beacon chain, the term for Ethereum’s upcoming proof-of-stake blockchain.  Some $137 million in shorts and $93 million in longs were liquidated. Liquidation is when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. It happens when a trader cannot meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position and fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open.  Ether rose as much as 10% in the past 24 hours and is up nearly 30% since last Monday. The asset traded at just over $1,500 in early European hours today – setting a one-month high – after breaking out of the $1,000 to $1,200 price range, price charts show.  Price charts suggest that prices could go as high as $1,800 if the current buying action continues. Meanwhile, support at around the $1,350 area exists.  Ether was trading at just over $1,000 last Thursday. The upward movement since then has caused losses of over $337 million in short liquidations, data from Coinglass shows. Saturday saw over $174 million in shorts liquidated, followed by $33 million on Sunday and $125 million on Monday as of writing time.  Saturday’s figures were the most losses on ether futures over the past three months. Meanwhile, the data shows that highly leveraged longs also took on significant losses amid the volatility, with over $194 million in losses over the past three days.

But will this bull run beat the $1 resistance? Key Technical Points: MATIC prices have increased by 19.12% in the last 24 hours. The price action shows a breakout rally sustaining above the 100-day SMA. The 24-hour trading volume of Polygon is $1.6 Billion, indicating a rise of 1.1%. Past Performance of MATIC After retesting the 50-day SMA on 12 July, the MATIC prices took a bullish turnaround with a 20% jump the next day. The price jump on 13 July resulted in a bullish engulfing candle and started a bull run to approach $0.78, close to the 100-day SMA. The bull run exceeded the $0.80 mark with a 17% jump today, increasing the inflation rate of the last week to 65%. Source – Tradingview MATIC Technical Analysis The MATIC price showcases a solid bullish commitment in the volume indicator as the intraday trading volume surges to support the positive trend. Hence Traders can expect the ongoing uptrend to surpass the psychological Mark of $1 to reach the 200-day SMA. Despite maintaining a bearish trend in motion, the simple moving averages showcase a high possibility of a bullish crossover between the 50 and 100 days average line. It is due to the bullish growth influencing a positive turnaround in the 50-day average line and the price sustaining about 100-day SMA. The RSI indicator slope labels polygon token as overbought as the slope exceeds the 70% barrier. Furthermore, the MACD indicator shows the positive trend of the fast and slow lines gaining a bullish trend. Additionally, the resurfacing positive histograms intensify, indicating an increase in the buying pressure. In a nutshell, MATIC technical analysis displays a high likelihood of a positive trend soon to reclaim the psychological Mark of $1. Upcoming Trend If the MATIC prices sustain above $0.80, traders can expect the prices to beat the psychological Mark of $1 soon to test the overhead resistance of the 200-day SMA.

42422746,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0p1Hh,1658143860,"The 'Merge Trade' Has Begun, Experts Say, as Ether Surges and stETH Discount Narrows","Renewed clarity about the timeline of programmable blockchain Ethereum's highly anticipated transition to a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm, seems to have galvanized investor interest in ether (ETH) and its staked derivative on Lido finance called staked ether (stETH), offering a reprieve to the battered cryptocurrencies.  On Thursday, Ethereum Foundation member Tim Beiko suggested Sept. 19 as the provisional launch date for the Merge, which will see the world's biggest smart contract blockchain transition from the energy-intensive proof-of-work consensus mechanism to a more environment-friendly proof-of-stake mechanism.  Since Beiko's announcement, ether has rallied roughly 22%, hitting a one-month high of $1,475, according to CoinDesk data. The token registered a 15% gain in the seven days to July 17, the biggest jump since March.  The staked ether's discount relative to the price of ether has narrowed to 0.98 from 0.96 since Thursday, per data source CoinMarketCap. The token representing an equivalent amount of ether staked in Lido Finance is supposed to trade at a price closer to ether. stETH's price fell into a discount of 0.93 to ETH following the collapse of Terra in May and has not been able to recover since. Lido Finance is a liquid staking protocol allowing users to stake coins while retaining liquidity and bypassing the burden of owning a minimum of 32 ETH to become a staker. Users can redeem staked ETH for ETH only after transfers are enabled on Ethereum 2.0.  ""ETH has undergone a rapid change in narrative over the past week with speculators purely focused on the upcoming 'merge' as a catalyst for appreciation,"" said Matthew Dibb, chief operating officer and co-founder of Stack Funds. ""Adding to this, we believe that there is a significant amount of sidelined capital that has been waiting on bullish momentum to establish new positions.""  Several observers consider Ethereum's impending transition equivalent to three Bitcoin halvings – a programmed code that halves the per block bitcoin (BTC) currency supply every four years – that will lead to a 90% reduction in ether's annual issuance. Simply put, the transition is likely to bring a store of value or deflationary appeal to ether. The upgrade has been long pending.  Like other market participants, ether investors tend to factor in bullish developments in advance. For instance, ether rallied over 60% to $2,800 in the three weeks leading up to the London hard fork implemented on Aug. 5, 2021. The hard fork activated a mechanism to burn the portion of fees paid to miners.  The Ethereum 2.0 upgrade has been long overdue and has seen several delays. However, the recent successful merges of the Ropsten and Sepolia testnets and the Goerli testnet's planned transition to proof-of-stake on for Aug. 11 has raised hopes for the mainnet merge in September.  The foundation's strongest hint of the tentative date of the Merge on record came as the crypto market looked for reasons to bounce, having priced in much of the bad news over the past two months.  Ether tanked 60% to less than $1,000 from $2,700 in the past two months as fears of faster liquidity withdrawal by the Federal Reserve, Terra's collapse and eventual bankruptcies of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, several crypto lenders saw investors dump crypto holdings.  ""Any positive news at this point is a welcome thing for markets,"" Jason Pagoulatos, markets associate at Delphi Digital, told CoinDesk TV on Friday. ""But it's definitely not the only reason ETH is up.""  Pagoulatos added that the bounce is typical of market action expected following the collapse of May and June.  John Ng Pangilinan, a managing partner at Singapore-based Signum, voiced a similar opinion, saying the market has priced in macro and crypto-specific risks and is now focusing on the upcoming positives.  ""My opinion is ETH is rising in anticipation for Ethereum 2.0,"" Pangilinan said. ""Also, major firms that have collapsed and inflation announcements, I believe, have all been factored in. I do see recovery for both ETH and BTC should this accumulation phase hold throughout July, but we have to be mindful of regulatory impact, which I believe is coming. I do not see that dampening the markets.""  Ether's bounce is accompanied by renewed user demand for the blockchain, a sign the rally may have legs.  The amount of gas, or a measure of what users pay to use the Ethereum network, has increased from roughly 82 billion gwei to 100 billion gwei this month, according to data from Etherscan tracked by Galaxy Digital Research.  ""The amount of gas used on Ethereum has spiked this month after several months of precipitous decline, indicating that Ethereum usage and demand for block space is returning following a period of relative disinterest,"" Christine Kim, research analyst at Galaxy Digital, wrote in a weekly newsletter published Friday. ""Notably, recent spikes in transaction activity are coming from transfers of ERC-1155 tokens, which are tokens that can possess either fungible, semi-fungible, or non-fungible properties.""  What's more, whales, or large investors, have recently bought the dip in ether. ""Addresses holding over 1% of the ETH in circulation have increased their positions, blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock's weekly newsletter published Friday said. ""The total ETH balance held by addresses labeled as whales reached an all-time high this week. While this includes centralized exchanges, their specific holdings have been mostly trending downwards, while the staking contract and unidentified entities have been growing their assets.""  However, while the path of least resistance is on the higher side, it's probably contingent on the September Merge, as developers have hinted. A potential delay could demoralize buyers.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | FORKS,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/07/18/the-merge-trade-has-begun-experts-say-as-ether-surges-and-steth-discount-narrows,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/31c27d0710113f2be3e0d887e93946e7f67d1d93-1696x1008.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

But, will it reach $2000? Key Technical Points: ETH prices have increased by 9.94% in the last 24 hours. The price action shows a breakout rally sustaining above the 50-day SMA. The 24-hour trading volume of Ethereum is $22.41 Billion, indicating a rise of 7.8%. Past Performance of ETH After spending weeks in the consolidation range, ETH prices take an abrupt bullish turn and avoid an enormous drop below $1000. On June 13, Ether prices surged 7.25%, leading to the beginning of a bull market looking for a price increase of 38% in the last week. The rise in demand causes the break over the ceiling at $1200. Furthermore, the buying spree fuels the bull run resulting in a jump above the 50-day SMA. Source – Tradingview ETH Technical Analysis The ETH price takes an off from the 50-day SMA after forming the Doji candle this Sunday. However, the 5.49% growth today forms a bullish engulfing candlestick teasing a bull run to the 100-day SMA. Over the last month, both VI- and VI+ have shown several crossovers indicating uncertainty between market participants. However, with the recent range breakout, the wider gap between lines that are aligned positively shows a strong market sentiment. The ADX slope signals a potential bullish reversal as the downfall cushions after DI lines crossover for significant portions of the rally’s range bound. The DI lines regain bullish alignment and increase spread, reflecting an increase in buying pressure. In a nutshell, ETH technical analysis showcases an increase in the demand projecting a breakout rally to the 100-day SMA. Upcoming Trend If the ETH prices sustain above the 50-day SMA today, investors can expect an upward move up to the next opposing 100-day SMA at $2000.

49846,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/?p=243247,1658142937,BTC Technical Analysis: Will Bitcoin Escape The Consolidation Range?,"Breaking the streak of four bullish days, according to this technical analysis, BTC prices dropped last Sunday, teasing a bear cycle within the consolidation range. Key Technical Points: BTC prices have increased by 3.95% in the last 24 hours. The price action shows a high reversal possibility within the consolidation range. The 24-hour trading volume of Bitcoin is $32.97 Billion, indicating a rise of 14.85%. Past Performance of BTC The BTC price action shows the extended consolidation range after the downfall of 40% from $31K to $19K between June 7th and 18th. The consolidation ranges between $19000 and $22000, and the recent reversal accounts for a 12% jump in the last seven days. However, the bearish candle with wick formation indicates a potential bear cycle starting within the range. Source – Tradingview BTC Technical Analysis With the hopes of avoiding a bear cycle, BTC prices go green with the start of a new week. The price action shows a 2% growth on Monday, undermining the 1.86% drop a day prior. Hence, if the prices sustain the transition today, investors can expect bullish development escaping the consolidation range this week. Taking the intraday volume into account, we can see a lack of bullish commitment during the recent bull cycle as its trend declines. However, as the prices try to undermine the bearish attempt, we can expect growth in buying pressure supporting the breakout rally. The technical momentum indicators show a remarkable increase in the underlying bullishness as the fast and slow lines maintain a positive trend, with the RSI slope reaching the halfway line. However, the breakout rally will have to face the overhead resistance of the 50 DSMA slightly above the $23,000 mark. In a nutshell, BTC technical analysis showcases an increase in the underlying bullishness teasing a bullish breakout of the consolidation range. Upcoming Trend If the trapped bullish momentum escapes the consolidation range, investors can expect the breakout rally to face opposition at the 50-day SMA or the $25,000 mark. On the other hand, a bearish reversal within the consolidation range will test the bottom support close to the $19,000 mark.

Ethereum is currently regaining ground and progressing due to the favorable market situation. At the same time, some other altcoins are doing well on the weekly chart, such as Polygon (MATIC) and Lido DAO (LDO), which have seen considerable price increases over the last week and in the previous 24 hours as well. Related Reading | TA: Bitcoin Price Eyes Fresh Increase To $22K, Why Dips Remain Supported Only a few of the top 100 cryptocurrencies have been able to generate double-digit gains, and the rest are still suffering from the effects of the merciless crypto storm. One of them is Polygon (MATIC), which demonstrated a sizable gain. Per the CoinGecko statistics, MATIC is currently trading at $0.91, up almost 19.88% over the past 24 hours and a notable 65% gain over the last seven days. After Disney revealed that Polygon (MATIC) had been chosen for its “Accelerator Program,” the price of the coin increased quickly. The list also includes Lido DAO (LDO), which has experienced a significant gain. The decentralized autonomous organization’s governance token, LDO, outperformed over the last seven days with a remarkable increase of 167%. Its current price is $1.68, with an upward thrust of 6.1%throughout the previous 24 hours. Even though LDO was able to recover its losses from the June decline, in which it fell to a low of roughly $0.432899, it yet hasn’t found the support it needs to climb back to the May high of $3.3816. Ethereum(ETH) Is On A Comeback Rally Ethereum (ETH), the second largest coin, has recently crossed the $1,400 threshold. It has gained 9.31% over the previous 24 hours and is currently trading at $1,482.01. The currency has increased by around 29.32% over the past seven days, according to CoinMarketCap, and is thus gaining momentum. According to nomics data, ETH’s overall market cap increased by 8.78% over the last 24 hours to $179.11 billion. However, the price increase occurred after a week of poor performance and unfavorable market circumstances. Although, the specific cause is unknown. The fact is that the price spike occurred right after the ninth shadow fork’s introduction on July 14. It implies that the price spike may be caused by the rising popularity of Ethereum and its impending “Merge” to Proof-of-Stake. Related Reading | Preference For Ripple XRP Surges Among BSC Whales The Merge was covered during the most recent Consensus Layer Call of the Ethereum Foundation, which took place on Thursday. Tim Beiko, an Ethereum Foundation member, proposed September 19 as a tentative launch date, providing the most unambiguous indication that the Merge would happen soon. The merge upgrade combines Ethereum’s consensus and execution layers to switch the network from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake. It is anticipated to cut the network’s energy use by 99.95%, but it won’t necessarily result in lower transaction fees (gas).

7348,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/?p=243273,1658138091,"Bitcoin Breaks Above $22,000 as Crypto Market Shows Slight Recovery","The price of Bitcoin (BTC) rose above $22,000 on Monday, showing a slight recovery in the crypto market over the past few days and gaining a total of $150 billion to its capitalization, which now stands above $1 trillion. Bitcoin Price is Back Above $22,000 Bitcoin’s (BTC) price is currently trading at around $22,000, representing an increase of about 6.4% in the past seven days and 3.1% in the past 24 hours, according to data from CoinGecko. Ethereum, on the other hand, is the absolute leader for price performance, with the token being up 24.5% on the week and 6.6% in the past 24 hours. The strong demand in the market this week helped BTC cross back over $22,000 for the first time since early July. The upside was strong enough to push it out of the short-term wedge pattern it has been trading in since June. For the last few weeks, bitcoin (BTC) has been trading within a tight range between $19,000 and $22,000 with no major catalyst to the upside and traders trying to figure out where the bottom is. The flagship cryptocurrency, moreover, has plummeted by more than 70% from its record high in November, with around $2 trillion wiped off the value of the entire cryptocurrency market. Several macroeconomic factors such as surging inflation, geopolitical crises, and rising interest rates account for the ongoing volatility in the crypto markets. On top of that, there are also rumblings of a potential recession in the near future.

He said, “We also have significant congressional authorities to use our exempt authorities to personalize investor protection.” Chairman of SEC Highlights Work on Crypto Regulation In an interview with Yahoo Finance Live on Thursday, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler explained what may be anticipated from his organization regarding American cryptocurrency legislation. The public would gain currently from investor protection around these many service providers, such as the exchanges, lending platforms, and broker-dealers, Gensler retorted. The head of the SEC elaborated: “So, we at the SEC are working in each of those fields – exchanges, lending, and broker-dealers – and talking to industry participants about how to come into compliance or modify some of that compliance.” SEC Chairman’s ‘One Rule Book’ Suggestion In May, the SEC chair suggested that crypto coins be governed by “one rule book.” He said he was collaborating with his CFTC counterparts on a memorandum of understanding at the time. He noted that it would be a formal agreement to guarantee that trading in digital assets has sufficient safeguards and transparency. Gensler warned that many cryptocurrency tokens would fail in the wake of the failure of the cryptocurrencies Terra (LUNA) and TerraUSD (UST). After cryptocurrency lender Celsius Network froze withdrawals, he warned investors about “too good to be true” crypto items. Currently, Celsius is being investigated by the SEC for its choice to freeze accounts. Last week, the cryptocurrency company requested bankruptcy protection.

The written statement was in response to five written questions from Thirumaavalavan Thol, a member of Parliament. The questions included whether the RBI had issued any notice restricting the use of cryptocurrency in India during the last 10 years, and whether the government has any plan to legislate any law restricting the use of cryptocurrency in India.  Sitharaman said, ""RBI is of the view that cryptocurrencies should be prohibited."" The RBI's stance on crypto has remain unchanged for some time now. On Feb. 14, 2022, T Rabi Shankar, the deputy governor of India’s central bank, said that “banning cryptocurrency is perhaps the most advisable choice open to India.”  ""RBI has recommended for framing of legislation on this sector. RBI is of the view that cryptocurrencies should be prohibited. Cryptocurrencies are by definition borderless and require international collaboration to prevent regulatory arbitrage. Therefore any legislation for regulation or for banning can be effective only after significant international collaboration on evaluation of the risks and benefits and evolution of common taxonomy and standards,"" the finance minister said.  The question is among the first crypto-related queries in Parliament after reports that the RBI is responsible for a ""shadow ban"" on cryptocurrencies after payment processors cut off crypto exchanges. The question read, ""whether the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has issued instructions, circulars, directions, warnings etc. regarding restricting the issuance, buying, selling, holding and circulation of Cryptocurrency in India during the last ten years and if so, the details thereof?""  Apart from the known circular of April 6, 2018, prohibiting RBI's regulated entities from dealing in virtual currencies (later set aside by India's Supreme Court) the answer to question 1 does not reveal any new circular prohibiting the use of cryptocurrencies.  In May, Ajay Seth, a senior government official, had indicated a similar position when addressing questions about India possibly banning cryptocurrency by saying ""whatever we do, even if we go to the extreme form, the countries that have chosen to prohibit, they can't succeed unless there is a global consensus.""",NEGATIVE,없음,FIAT | REGULATION,Amitoj Singh,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/07/18/indian-finance-minister-echoes-central-banks-crypto-ban-call-but-says-global-collaboration-is-required,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c07ae22e4600e73b3cd2f2be0ff688f61c8708c7-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Swedish economy is transitioning from a “period of administration to an intense expansion” where the “entire industrial industry seeks to electrify,” Energy Minister Khashayar Farmanbar noted in a recent interview. “We need energy for more useful things than bitcoin, to be honest.” Sweden Attracted Many Bitcoin Miners With its hydro reservoirs and wind farms supplying clean and affordable electricity, Sweden has drawn a lot of bitcoin miners. Its coin manufacturing sector has grown to be among, if not the biggest, in all of Europe. The Stockholm government has assigned the Swedish Energy Agency to assess the energy usage in the digital world, particularly crypto mining because they are concerned about its rising power demand. The accessibility of inexpensive energy mainly determines the location of mining farms. At the same time, crypto asset values significantly impact their operators’ profits. These problems are expected to worsen due to the mandated assessment. Potential Imposition of Measures To Restrict Mining Farmanbar declined to say what policies the government would enact to limit mining, but two possibilities have been brought forward. One is to rearrange the order in which power users connect to the network, giving precedence to those who evidently contribute more to society’s advantages, such as producing many jobs. The other option is to restrict the application of the favorable tax status that all data centers receive. Authorities are urged to learn more about cutting-edge technologies like cryptocurrency mining. Environmental protection agencies proposed a ban on energy-intensive Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining in the European Union last year against the backdrop of a sharp rise in energy consumption in the industry.

7572,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=495969,1658131294,"P2E, P&E, P2O: A Deep Dive Into GameFi Models","GameFi isn’t a new concept, in fact, CryptoKitties was the first project to bring this concept to light in 2017. It is known for pioneering the play-to-earn gaming model, which is now the standard basis that all blockchain games follow. The model was a huge hit, bringing the game 1.5 million users and $40 million in transaction volume. The fact that this occurred during the early years of the crypto market was a significant achievement for the game. Since then, the sector has evolved in response to increasing user demands. Today, there are around 1,498 GameFi projects, with numbers rising by 99% year on year. In 2022, for example, investment in GameFi reached $3.7 billion, exceeding the total of $780 million in 2021. And with these expanding numbers, game revenue models have also evolved. Projects are moving away from the original play-to-earn model and toward other models that guarantee long-term viability. Let’s take a look at the different models and how they are benefitting users. Play- to- Earn Play-to-earn (P2E) games enable players to earn real-world monetary benefits for playing the game. The model employs crypto and NFTs to power and monetize the in-game economy. While NFTs represent in-game items (like avatars, outfits, etc), cryptocurrencies are used to incentivize the players. NFTs also provide players complete ownership of in-game assets, enabling them to benefit from that outside of the game. Even every game action, including quests and challenges, is rewarded with a native in-game cryptocurrency. Further, P2E has various advantages, including the opportunity for users to earn money, own assets, and generate value for the community. There is no better game to describe this than Axie Infinity. Axie is a Pokémon-style monster-battling game in which players capture cartoon creatures known as Axies. Each Axie is an NFT with distinct skills and weaknesses, and players may adventure, combat, and breed their Axies as they go through the game. As a reward for their efforts, players receive Smooth Love Potion (SLP) crypto tokens. Although P2E games overcome many traditional gaming problems, they nevertheless have limits. The first is the model’s emphasis on earning rather than gaming experience. This has led to inflationary tokenomics, causing games to collapse. Even the hefty entrance cost has caused gamers to forsake P2E games. Play-And-Earn Play-and-earn is more of a game progression as compared to the play-to-earn model. It is an evolution of P2E that allows gamers to get what they desire while simultaneously earning money and acquiring ownership. This model focuses on making games enjoyable and rewarding. Its design objective is to get individuals to spend time playing and improving, competing and collaborating, and building a truly amazing community. Moreover, it tackles P2E problems like user retention, rewards sustainability, and gameplay experience. UniX gaming, for example, employs a play-and-earn model that allows gamers to own, build, share and chat. It empowers them to use their voices and resources to create a healthy gaming environment. Moreover, UniX only focuses on developing AAA games with a sustainable incentive system. In terms of playability, the model much outperforms P2E. There are, however, a few things that it still lacks. It does not permit the ownership of in-game resources. This may result in decreased user retention and uneven value proposition for gamers. Play-and-earn focuses on playability and may miss out on delivering extra utilities, which is blockchain’s sole purpose. However, a more refined version known as play-to-own is on the rise, offering solutions to all Web3 gaming problems. Play-to-Own Play-to-own (also known as Play-and-Own) is a more in-depth version of play-and-earn. The model focuses on allowing players to earn from their gameplay while also converting the in-game into NFTs. It provides proof of ownership over the in-game objects they possess. For example, any digital item obtained by the player has a tangible worth since it may be sold in a marketplace or in a peer-to-peer trade. The ultimate advantage of this model over others is increased retention and value proposition, as well as the creation of new income prospects. Life Beyond is an example of a blockchain-powered MMORPG that combines play-and-earn and play-to-own elements. It is presently in its first Alpha stage. The basic gameplay revolves around players crafting items, weapons, and equipment, as well as gathering resources to battle enemies. Users earn marketplace currency, the LBToken as a reward for their in-game activities. The in- game NFTs may be utilized across the game’s maker, Darewise, and its portfolio of future games. The game, although, seems fascinating, only time will tell if it lives up to its promises. GameFi Keeps Evolving GameFi is one of those sectors that is constantly evolving. One reason for this might be the infancy of technological infrastructure behind blockchain gaming. From play-to-earn games like Axie Infinity to play-and-earn games like UniX Gaming, the industry is evolving faster than ever. This post has covered most of it, as well as how certain games have been quick to implement new innovative game revenue models.

US And UK To Deepen Ties On Crypto Regulation Speaking at the international Peterson Institute for International Economics on Thursday, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority’s chief executive, Nikhil Rathi, stated that the country wants to “deepen ties” with the U.S. government on crypto regulation. “The U.S. and U.K. will deepen ties on crypto-asset regulation and market developments including in relation to stablecoins and the exploration of central bank digital currencies,” Rathi said. Additionally, the financial regulator also coordinated with the U.S. and Singapore to launch an International Organization of Securities task force aimed at “decentralized finance and crypto market integrity risks.” Rathi added that the FCA did not have the power to authorize the creation of a regulatory framework for crypto in the United Kingdom, as many of its rules in the space related to Anti-Money Laundering. “Many of the issues we face also require an international response. We greatly value ongoing enforcement cooperation between the FCA and US agencies, including the SEC, CFTC and DOJ in particular, which has created an important set of precedents that demonstrate the ability to act effectively on a global basis,” he explained. In April, the British government unveiled a detailed plan to make the country a global crypto hub. This includes establishing a dynamic regulatory framework for crypto, regulating stablecoins, and working with the Royal Mint to create a non-fungible token (NFT) to be issued by the Summer.

Slumping VC Investments in Crypto Market Investments in crypto companies totaled $9.3 billion in the first six months of 2022, down from the record $12.5 billion in the first half of 2021. Despite a 26% drop in crypto investments, VCs are still interested in investing in the industry. This is because the deal flow actually increased year-over-year from 456 deals to 534 deals. However, the increase in the deal flow also indicates that smaller deal sizes have helped drive the lower overall investments. In the meantime, venture capital investments are down practically everywhere, not just in crypto companies. For instance, data from Crunchbase revealed that the second-quarter funding fell 26% quarter over quarter from $162 billion in the first quarter and 27% year over year from $165 billion in the second quarter of 2021. Overall, the total VC investments in the second quarter totaled over $4.2 billion, which is significantly on the lower spectrum than last year.

Philip Lowe Favors Privately-Issued Regulated Crypto Speaking on Sunday at a seminar on the sidelines of the G20 finance ministers and central bank governors meeting in Bali, Phillip Lowe, the governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia was reluctant to use the words “cryptocurrency” or “assets” as, according to him, it did not have any currency characteristics. Lowe believes that there are various challenges associated with private money, and retailers would always prefer state-backed currencies. However, he also thinks that the private sector is more likely to develop a successful stablecoin linked to official currencies than government bodies unless there are regulations involved. “If these tokens are going to used widely by the community they are going to need to be backed by the state, or regulated just as we regulate bank deposits,” said Lowe. “I tend to think that the private solution is going to be better if we can get the regulatory arrangements right – because the private sector is better than the central bank at innovating and designing features for these tokens, and there are also likely to be very significant costs for the central bank setting up a digital token system,” he said. In related developments, Australian authorities have recently said that a rule book-style framework is the best method to tackle the risks that come with crypto. Rather than regulating cryptocurrencies directly, their goal is to regulate cryptocurrency exchanges instead.

7340,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/?p=241180,1658118673,Cardano vs Bitcoin l Which Is a More Decentralized Crypto Network?,"In February 2020, Cardano co-founder and IOHK CEO Charles Hoskinson made a bold claim. He stated that Cardano (ADA) would one day become the most decentralized cryptocurrency in the world. Hoskinson believed that upgrades to the Cardano network could make it between 50 and 100 times more decentralized than Bitcoin (BTC). Hoskinson’s assertions are not surprising; Cardano has been a hot topic for a while now. Analysts view it as one of the few digital assets capable of challenging Bitcoin’s dominance of the crypto space. Would greater decentralization make Cardano more attractive to crypto users? And would it increase ADA’s value and influence in the cryptoverse? To answer these questions let’s do a Cardano vs Bitcoin comparison with regard to their decentralization. But we first need to understand decentralization and why it is essential in crypto. What Is Decentralization? Simply put, decentralization means moving control and decision-making from a central entity to a distributed network. Decentralization brings inclusivity, transparency, security, and greater control of information or assets. It also provides a trustless environment, improves data reconciliation, reduces points of weakness in a system, and optimizes the distribution of resources. In a nutshell, the more decentralized a crypto network is, the better it is. Is Cardano More Decentralized Than Bitcoin? Many industry observers have echoed Charles Hoskinson’s assertion that Cardano will be more decentralized than BTC. Below, we will take a look at Cardano vs Bitcoin to understand why they believe this to be so: Completely Decentralized Block Production As far as block production is concerned, Cardano and Bitcoin are vastly different. The Bitcoin blockchain is primarily controlled by the ten biggest BTC mining pools. These mining pools account for approximately 85 percent of all block production on the network. In contrast to Bitcoin, Cardano is not controlled by a handful of groups. Instead, the network’s entire community, comprising of 2,200 stake pool operators, is exclusively responsible for 100 percent of all block production. Spreading block production across a large number of people or pools increases the security of a blockchain or crypto because it lessens the possibility of a 51 percent attack on the network. Stake Saturation Point Decentralization on Cardano is further enhanced by a mechanism known as the stake pool saturation point. On the Cardano network, each stake pool is only allowed to be a specific size. Once that size limit is reached, staking rewards become fixed, making the pools less lucrative. This is the stake pool saturation point. For decentralization to be truly effective, the number of stake pools or mining pools must be as high as possible. The saturation point for stake pools is meant to make sure that transactions on the Cardano network are not controlled by a small number of large stake pools but rather by a large number of smaller ones. Governance While some blockchain systems have integrated formal governance processes, including voting for proposals or electing leaders, bitcoin has nothing of the sort. Bitcoin does not rely on on-chain mechanisms to handle governance issues. Instead, it uses off-chain dynamics and interactions of its users, especially a tiny niche of developers and miners. On the other hand, Cardano is working on an $80 million fund dubbed Project Catalyst, which is an attempt to make its community more involved in the governance of the network. Project Catalyst is wholly funded by the Cardano community and aims to turn their ideas and proposals into innovative and impactful real-world projects. Decentralization Timeframes Another pointer to Cardano’s eventually being more decentralized than Bitcoin is the roadmaps, or lack thereof, highlighting the networks’ plans. The Cardano roadmap divides the future of the network into several important phases or eras, with decentralization and access at the heart of each one. For example, Cardano users in the Goguen era should be able to build decentralized applications (DApps) and create fully functional smart contracts, even if they don’t have a technical background. The Basho era is expected to improve the scalability and interoperability of the Cardano network. Finally, the Voltaire era will introduce a voting system where Cardano users will be able to leverage their stake and vote to shape the future of the network. Also, a treasury system will be set up where a small portion of all transaction fees will be pooled to pay for changes that the community votes on. On the other hand, Bitcoin has yet to share such detailed plans for its future. Upgrades on the network are made on a need basis. This implies that, unless it is felt along the way that the network might need a bit more decentralization, it will most probably stay the same. Conclusion Cardano vs Bitcoin comparison signifies that both crypto networks have strong decentralization points. But Cardano already has an advantage over Bitcoin because it does better on … Continued The post Cardano vs Bitcoin l Which Is a More Decentralized Crypto Network? appeared first on Cryptoknowmics-Crypto News and Media Platform .",NEUTRAL,ADA | BTC,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING | REGULATION,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/cardano-vs-bitcoin-l-which-is-a-more-decentralized-crypto-network/?utm_source=rss&#038;utm_medium=rss&#038;utm_campaign=cardano-vs-bitcoin-l-which-is-a-more-decentralized-crypto-network,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png

7339,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/?p=241182,1658110651,What Does it Entail to Become a Blockchain Lawyer?,"Blockchain technology has only been around for a little over ten years. But today, the technology is used for everything, from storing virtual money and documenting transactions to providing digital identification. The way individuals and corporations do business online is changing because of blockchain technology. But even though the technology opens up new areas, it also has a lot of unknowns. This is why federal agencies such as the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have stepped in to regulate the blockchain space. What Opportunities are Available in Blockchain Law? Organizations that work with blockchain platforms, cryptocurrency traders, and cryptocurrency investors need to be careful and get legal help before doing anything that could lead to civil or criminal prosecution. It is for the above reason that a new field in the legal space is slowly taking shape. Blockchain lawyers are legal practitioners who provide counsel to clients who deploy blockchain-based business solutions, create or use cryptocurrencies, or integrate distributed ledger-based technologies in their processes. The crypto space is filled with opportunities for lawyers to promote best practices and ensure that trailblazing and disruptive blockchain projects operate within existing legal frameworks. The following are areas where attorneys can lend their expertise to the blockchain and crypto community: Consulting Lawyers working in blockchain will have many clients, from big companies to small startups and even individuals who want to make money from crypto. These potential clients are usually blank slates as far as the legal requirements of the crypto space are concerned, and it is the lawyer’s job to help them make a legal road map for corporate governance and other issues. Here, the blockchain lawyer helps them decide where to incorporate, what kind of legal structure would work best for their business, and whether to make an initial coin offering (ICO) or not. Policy Formulation The necessity for policy formulation is greatest with regard to newly developing technology such as blockchain. It is common knowledge that governments are typically the slowest to adopt new technologies. However, it is still possible to provide this service to organizations primarily focused on developing legal structures. Legislative Tracking Given the ever-evolving nature of blockchain, there is usually some new legislation or policy connected to its regulation being issued somewhere in the world at any given time. The widespread legal ambiguity that currently hangs over blockchain technology means maintaining an up-to-date review of these legislations is critical. Compliance Some countries might require organizations to get licenses before engaging in blockchain or crypto activities. The legal status of a token might also determine whether or not a project needs a license. For instance, in some jurisdictions, if a token is deemed a utility, it would not require a license to operate. However, the issuing organization would need a license if the token is considered a security. Blockchain lawyers would come in handy in ensuring crypto projects avoid statutory and regulatory violations through compliance with the legal requirements of different jurisdictions. Litigation It is estimated that there has been a four-fold increase in legal suits involving blockchain technology and its applications in the last four years. Blockchain lawyers can represent companies and individuals in investigations and inquiries involving regulatory bodies. They can also provide defense representation for civil or criminal cases that may arise from allegations of fraud, money laundering, tax evasion, and assorted cyber crimes. What Do You Need to Become a Blockchain Lawyer? The path to becoming a blockchain lawyer is not the easiest. It would be best if you are both legally and technologically savvy. Like any other legal field, you should have a certified law degree from a recognized institution. Have a very sound knowledge of blockchain technology. An in-depth understanding of blockchain tech will enable you to become a better lawyer. The technical level will give you the edge and expertise needed to analyze any legal issue related to the technology. Know what smart contracts are. As a blockchain lawyer, you will help your clients create and utilize smart contracts and represent them in regulatory matters concerning the same. To successfully draft smart contracts, you must also have basic skills such as drafting commercial contracts and understanding compliance procedures. Keep yourself updated with significant developments and policies not only in your home jurisdiction but globally as well. This will give you an insight into how fast and dynamic the legal tech space changes. Also, make sure to develop a habit of reading any case law and any new development related to blockchain. Get yourself skilled enough to freelance. In this way, you can even escrow yourself to jurisdictions where blockchain-related legal issues already exist. This will help you gain practical knowledge, which will help you frame yourself as a better blockchain … Continued The post What Does it Entail to Become a Blockchain Lawyer? appeared first on Cryptoknowmics-Crypto News and Media Platform .",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TOKEN SALE,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/how-to-become-a-blockchain-lawyer/?utm_source=rss&#038;utm_medium=rss&#038;utm_campaign=how-to-become-a-blockchain-lawyer,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png

7338,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/?p=242770,1658106879,Top 5 Resilient Decentralized Oracles,"Oracles are one of the most significant protocols of the blockchain industry that keep the sector running using oracles. The primary function of oracles is to supply real-world and real-time data to distributed ledger technology and smart contracts because they cannot acquire data independently. Decentralized oracles were introduced to address the oracle problems plaguing the blockchain ecosystem. A decentralized oracle or decentralized oracle network (DON) is a network of autonomous blockchain oracles that feed data to a blockchain. The decentralized oracle network’s nodes and oracles each independently retrieve and bring data onto the chain from an off-chain source. The data is then aggregated for the system to determine a deterministic value of truth for that data point. Oracle problems are resolved via decentralized oracles. Despite the recent crypto crisis, Oracle cryptocurrency projects remain a popular investment option. In this article, we take a look at the top 5 Decentralized Oracles Crypto Projects. QED QED protocol is built on the DelphiOracle. With its strong economic foundation, this decentralized oracle aims to close a gap in the crypto industry. It links several blockchains, off-chain data sources, and platforms for smart contracts. Its security, accuracy, resilience, and complete decentralisation make QED the ideal alternative protocol. Compared to comparable oracle protocols like Chainlink, which have an average refresh rate of 120s, this oracle’s data refresh rate of 0.5s is impressive and shows potential. It enables more decentralized applications with reduced data finality requirements and higher refresh rates. DelphiOracle is the most frequently used oracle on the blockchain, having been utilised over 60,000 times on the WAX blockchain. The QED oracle protocol is robust and dependable. QED has always used external collateral and has never relied on a system token for collateral – it predicted the death spiral of systems like Terra Luna. Band Protocol Band Protocol is one of the famous oracles to check out. This decentralized oracle protocol on the Ethereum and Cosmos blockchains provides real-world data to dApps and smart contracts. Band Protocol is a component of the Cosmos Network because it was developed using the Cosmos SDK. Nevertheless, it may function with other blockchains all because of Cosmos’s Inter Blockchain Communication (IBC) Protocol. Band Protocol attempts to do this in light of the DeFi industry’s rapid expansion and the dApps’ need for timely and reliable data delivery. With the help of BAND tokens, the Band Protocol enables network users to reach a consensus on data verification. During the verification process, the token serves as collateral. Using its native BAND token, the Band Protocol rewards its Validators for responding to requests for external data, taking part in consensus, and creating new blocks. API3 The API3 project successfully addresses the oracle issue by establishing decentralized APIs that make it simple for blockchains to access off-site data. By generating potent decentralized apps that support the expansion of DeFI, it is a reasonably simple and reliable solution that does not need intermediaries. These dAPIs come directly from the blockchain. As a result of the combination of different operators, they enable API providers to host the oracle nodes directly, promoting a direct connection between the blockchain and data sources. More protection is provided by dAPIs, which likewise deliver accurate data while shielding API providers from nefarious third parties. Decentralized Oracle Service Network (DOS) Another oracle that has performed successfully in providing current data to blockchain-based systems is DOS. The layer-2 protocol, the Decentralized Oracle Service Network (DOS), is designed for horizontal scalability. More nodes are added to the network to boost the oracle protocol’s computational capacity. DOS has also demonstrated its security to be resilient to cyberattacks. The crypto-economic model is also used. Decentralized Information Asset (DIA) Decentralized Information Asset (DIA) is a platform that provides users with a way to gather, validate, and distribute valuable data. A Swiss-based Not-for-Profit organization owns the open-source software. Through the provision of reliable real-time data that drives DeFI, this oracle platform seeks to bridge the gap between blockchain and the natural world. Its economic structure is comparable to the Band Protocol, rewarding active community participation with crypto incentives. This Oracle platform encourages openness by making its data feeds open-source and readily available for audits if necessary. DIA has enormous promise for the DeFi Ecosystem’s oncoming, explosive growth. Conclusion Decentralized oracle is a multi-layer, cross-platform Oracle solution that can bridge to support virtually any blockchain and provide data to any decentralized ecosystem that requires it. Blockchain oracles are the key to unlocking the future that smart contracts have for us. For smart contracts to be the superior form of agreement, we need access to diverse and reliable data.
