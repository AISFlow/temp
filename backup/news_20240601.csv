28779866,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=611055,1717284621,Chainlink Is Not Done: Analyst Predicts 300% Rise Against Bitcoin,"A crypto analyst has highlighted the Chainlink remarkable resilience amidst market volatility, predicting that the cryptocurrency is getting ready to witness a 300% surge against Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency. Chainlink Poised For 300% Increase Against Bitcoin Chainlink, a decentralized blockchain oracle network has been gaining traction recently, bolstered by the innovative developments within its ecosystem. Popular crypto analyst, Michael van de Poppe has expressed optimism about Chainlink’s native token, LINK, predicting a major bull rally for the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Buy $112 Million Worth Of DOGE As Crypto Investors Turn Their Attention To Meme Coins Sharing a price chart depicting Chainlink (LINK)/ Bitcoin (BTC) price movements from 2021 to 2025, Poppe forecasted in an X (formerly Twitter) post that LINK is on track to witness an exponential increase between 150% to 300% against BTC. As of writing, the price of Bitcoin is trading at $67,623, according to CoinMarketCap. The cryptocurrency has fallen below key support levels of around $70,000 and reflects a slight decline of 1.05% in the last 24 hours. Poppe has revealed that he would not be surprised if Chainlink reaches this price milestone, underscoring his confidence in the cryptocurrency’s price fundamentals and future potential compared to Bitcoin. In the chart analysis, the crypto analyst pinpointed a critical resistance level for LINK/BTC around $0.000448, indicating that this point could trigger strong breakouts upward for Chainlink. In an earlier post, Poppe identified Chainlink’s next resistance zone at $21, predicting that the cryptocurrency could see its price trading between $25 and $30 in the coming months. For this to happen, the crypto analyst explained that Chainlink will have to establish a higher low on the weekly time frame. Poppe’s optimistic outlook on Chainlink comes after the blockchain platform has initiated several strategic partnerships. Chainlink has collaborated with Circle, a peer-to-peer payments company, to expand developer usage of USDC and Euro Coin (EURC). Additionally, the blockchain platform recently allied with SWIFT, an interbank messaging system, to accelerate the adoption of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). These innovative developments may serve as a catalyst for a potential price increase for the cryptocurrency, driven by enhanced network utility and increased adoption from new users. LINK Price Update Amidst broader market conditions, Chainlink has been performing better than expected, experiencing consistent price increases since the beginning of the year. Over the past month, Chainlink has risen by 45.01%, underscoring the cryptocurrency’s growing demand and interest from investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Enters Dreaded ‘Chop Season’ – What Does This Mean For Price? CoinMarketCap’s data has also shown that Chainlink has surged by 3.32% in the last 24 hours and 7.79% over the past week. This bullish performance can be said to be attributed to Chainlink’s ongoing development initiatives in its ecosystem alongside the recent approval of Spot Ethereum ETFs by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As of writing, the price of Chainlink is trading at $18.53, reflecting a 24-hour increase of 14.86% in its daily trading volume.

28777193,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=611030,1717277425,Worrying Signs For XRP: Price Tumbles As Demand Dries Up,"Crypto investors are keeping a close eye on Ripple (XRP) as technical indicators paint a concerning picture for the altcoin’s price. After closing below its 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) for four consecutive days, XRP has entered what many analysts interpret as a bearish zone. Related Reading: MATIC Under The Lens: Why Is Polygon Busy But Not Making Money? This technical indicator suggests a potential shift in market sentiment, with the average price of XRP over the past 20 days acting as a resistance level. With the current price trading below this key benchmark, analysts fear a decline in demand could be imminent. At the time of writing, XRP was trading at $0.52, down 0.3% and 3.1% in the last 24 hours and seven days, respectively, data from Coingecko shows. Demand For XRP Loses Steam Adding fuel to the bearish fire are XRP’s momentum indicators, which provide insights into the strength and direction of price movements. Both the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) are currently positioned below their neutral points. This suggests that buying pressure behind XRP is waning, with investors potentially looking to offload their holdings rather than accumulate more. Further dampening the mood is a significant drop in XRP’s active on-chain addresses. According to data from Santiment, the number of daily active addresses on the XRP network has cratered by 30% over the past month. This decline is often seen as a precursor to a price slump, as it indicates a decrease in overall network activity and user engagement. Profit Amidst The Gloom? However, there are some glimmers of hope for XRP bulls. An interesting data point reveals that daily traders are still managing to turn a profit. An analysis of XRP’s daily transaction volume in profit compared to loss shows that for every transaction ending in a loss, 1.16 transactions yield profits. This suggests that despite the overall bearish sentiment, short-term trading opportunities might exist for skilled investors who can capitalize on market volatility. MVRV Ratio Offers A Different Perspective Another factor that could entice some investors is the negative Market Value to Realised Value (MVRV) ratio for XRP. This metric essentially compares the current market price of XRP with the average price at which all XRP tokens were acquired. A negative MVRV ratio suggests that XRP is currently undervalued, potentially presenting a buying opportunity for investors seeking assets trading below their historical price points. Related Reading: Ethereum Bloodbath: Over $55 Million In Longs Liquidated As Price Plummets XRP Price Forecast Meanwhile, the current XRP price prediction indicates a 20% rise to $0.626627 by July 1, 2024, despite a bearish market sentiment reflected by technical indicators. The Fear & Greed Index at 72 shows high investor greed, suggesting strong buying behavior but also a risk of overbought conditions and potential price corrections if sentiment shifts. Over the last 30 days, XRP has had almost an equal number of days with price increases (47%). This shows a balance between buying and selling pressures. The price has fluctuated by 2%, indicating mostly stable but noticeable changes. This balance suggests the market is steady, contributing to the current bearish outlook despite a positive long-term price prediction.

28775412,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=611008,1717272032,"Bitcoin Retreats After Failing To Break Crucial $72,983 Resistance","Following the failure to break above the $72,983 resistance level, the price of Bitcoin has continued to drop. Although Bitcoin’s price is still trading above the 1-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), this rejection has led to the crypto asset dropping from $71,942 to $66,785 and moving below the SMA both in the 1-hour and the 4-hour chart. This drop below the SMA could trigger a change of character and the price will go bearish. As of the time of writing the price of Bitcoin was trading at around $67,635 and was up by 0.14% with a market capitalization of over $1.3 trillion and a 24-hour trading volume of over $25 billion. Its market capitalization and trading volume are both down by 1.14% and 6.07% respectively in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin Price Conditions In 4-Hour And 1-Day Chart From the 4-hour timeframe, BTC has dropped below the simple moving average. This indicates that the price of BTC might begin to move downward from this point. The 1-hour MACD also indicates that BTC could go bearish as the MACD histograms are trending below the zero line. Also, the MACD line and the signal have crossed each other trending below the MACD zero line. From the 1-day chart, it can be observed that BTC‘s price is moving toward the 100-day simple moving average. The 1-day MACD also creates a formation suggesting that Bitcoin’s price might go bearish, as the histograms are already trending below the MACD zero line. The MACD line and the MACD signal line have crossed each other and are heading toward the MACD zero line. Examining the price formations and that of MACD from both timeframes, BTC could make a huge drop and probably start a bearish trend. A Path To New All-Time High On The Horizon? Currently, there is one major resistance level $73,203, and two major support levels $60,146 and $50,604. If the price of Bitcoin goes bearish as predicted, it will start to move downward toward the $60,146 support level. Should it break below this level, it could move further to test the $50,604 support level. Also, there are other support levels below $67,635, which BTC could move on to test if there is a break below the $60,146 and $50,604 support levels.

Related Reading: MATIC Under The Lens: Why Is Polygon Busy But Not Making Money? This recent rally comes amidst positive sentiment surrounding the crypto market, fueled in part by the long-awaited approval of an Ethereum ETF. Analysts are cautiously optimistic about BONK’s future, with some predicting a potential return to its all-time high. Analyst Bullish On New ATH For BONK Renowned crypto analyst CryptoJack has been tracking BONK’s price movement closely. In a recent analysis, he highlighted that the coin is following a bullish pattern he outlined earlier. The price of $BONK is doing exactly what I said it would do in my analysis last week. It was rejected by the resistance and now needs to bounce from the orange area of support to stay bullish. If we can stay above this area, I am expecting new ATHs very soon for #BONK! pic.twitter.com/j3Abd7J5YA — CryptoJack (@cryptojack) May 30, 2024 However, CryptoJack emphasizes the importance of a crucial support level – visualized as an “orange zone” on charts. If BONK can maintain its position above this zone, the analyst predicts a potential breakout and a surge towards new all-time highs (ATHs). BONK’s all-time high of $0.00004547, reached in March 2024, currently sits about 25% above the current price. While this historical peak suggests room for growth, some experts remain cautious. Technical analysis, the method CryptoJack employs, relies on past price movements to predict future trends, but it’s not a foolproof science. Meme Coin Frenzy: Booms And Whimpers The meme coin market has a reputation for being driven more by hype and social media trends than by underlying fundamentals. This can lead to explosive price increases, but also to equally dramatic crashes. Remember “Dogefather” Elon Musk’s offhand tweets sending Dogecoin prices into a frenzy, only to see them plummet just as quickly? BONK is not immune to such influences. BONK Price Forecast Meanwhile, based on the current price prediction, Bonk is anticipated to rise by an impressive 226%, reaching $0.000112 by July 1, 2024. This substantial increase suggests a highly bullish long-term outlook despite the current bearish sentiment indicated by technical indicators.

28769411,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=610977,1717257638,Bitcoin Enters Dreaded ‘Chop Season’ – What Does This Mean For Price?,"Crypto analyst ShardiB recently revealed that Bitcoin has entered ‘chop season.’ This is significant as it could be a while before the flagship crypto finally archives that breakout, which will send it to new all-time highs (ATHs). Related Reading: MATIC Under The Lens: Why Is Polygon Busy But Not Making Money? How The Chop Season Will Affect Bitcoin’s Price While revealing that Bitcoin was about to enter the chop season, Shardi B hinted that the season would be filled with more sideways movement for the flagship crypto. The analyst made reference to the fact that BTC has continued to attempt to break out of its current range but has failed on every attempt so far. The crypto analyst claimed this would continue to be the top coin’s reality for a few more months, heading into the chop season. The analyst suggested it might be best to buy Bitcoin now and “hold and enjoy life for a few months while not getting chopped out.” Indeed, the flagship crypto has maintained a tepid price movement since the halving event as it continues to consolidate. Bitcoin has also failed to hold $70,000 as support every time it has broken above that level for a while now. Crypto expert Michael van de Poppe mentioned that the crypto successfully breaking out of this range is what will kickstart the Bitcoin bull run and send it to new ATHs. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital also echoed a similar sentiment as he suggested that Bitcoin is one breakout away from entering the parabolic phase of this market cycle. Interestingly, the crypto analyst laid out a narrative where BTC could enter this phase this week, stating that a weekly close above $69,000 “would alter the course of history.” However, that seems unlikely, as Bitcoin is currently on a downward trend, having dropped to as low as $67,000 in the last 24 hours. Rekt Capital added that previous cycles indicate that Bitcoin is still several weeks from entering this parabolic phase. Meanwhile, Arthur Hayes, the co-founder and former CEO of BitMEX, suggested this chop season would last until August while predicting that Bitcoin would continue to range between $60,000 and $70,000 until then. Bitcoin Breakout Could Be Closer Than Expected Crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto suggested in a recent X (formerly Twitter) post that Bitcoin’s breakout could happen sooner than expected. This came following his remarks that Bitcoin has displayed a broadened wedge on the daily chart and that the “breakout is closer than you think.” He claimed that $85,000 is the breakout target for Bitcoin. Related Reading: Ethereum Bloodbath: Over $55 Million In Longs Liquidated As Price Plummets Crypto analyst BitQuant also suggested that a breakout is imminent, stating that Bitcoin is about to make a “big move, which could start at any moment.” He claimed that the flagship crypto is following the same pattern as in February and March when it hit its current ATH of $73,000. The chart he shared showed that Bitcoin could rise to $92,000 when this move happens.

This development is expected to positively impact the meme coin, which has lagged for a while now. Related Reading: Ethereum Bloodbath: Over $55 Million In Longs Liquidated As Price Plummets Dogecoin Whales Accumulate 700 Million DOGE Crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that DOGE whales have bought over 700 million DOGE ($112 million) in the past 72 hours. This forms part of the current trend with crypto investors turning their attention to meme coins. Trading firm QCP Capital confirmed this trend in a recent market update, stating that traders are “shifting their focus to higher beta meme tokens like Shiba Inu (SHIBA), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Pepe (PEPE). The trading firm also claimed that these meme coins are “polling in the top 10 for open interest” with Shiba Inu and Pepe recording double-digit gains these past few days. These investors are also believed to have accumulated DOGE in anticipation of imminent price gains for the foremost meme coin. Dogecoin has lagged compared to the top meme coins, which have made significant runs in the last seven days. This suggests that the meme coin will likely make a run of its own soon enough. Crypto expert Michael van de Poppe labeled Dogecoin as the “safe bet to have in this cycle” while noting that the “meme coin fiesta” is still on with tokens like Dogwifhat. BONK, FLOKI, and Book of Meme (BOME) “waking up intensively.” Van de Poppe further claimed that Dogecoin is the “easiest play of them all” even though it isn’t moving yet. In a more recent X post, Van de Poppe again claimed that Dogecoin “is such an easy play.” he predicted that the meme coin would record a massive breakout and might reach $1 in this market cycle. In a recent X post, Martinez also suggested that a parabolic surge was on the horizon for Dogecoin. He stated that the market sentiment for Dogecoin is as bearish as it was in early February, just before the meme coin’s price surged by 200%. Why Dogecoin Is One Of The ‘Lowest Risk Trades’ Crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa mentioned that Dogecoin’s rise to $0.40 is “one of the lowest risk trades this cycle.” The analyst outlined reasons why they hold this belief. Firstly, Altcoin Sherpa stated that retail investors will eventually accumulate as much Dogecoin as they can, which will cause it to experience such price surge. Related Reading: MATIC Under The Lens: Why Is Polygon Busy But Not Making Money? Secondly, the analyst made reference to the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, and his fondness for the meme coin and stated that “all it takes is one retarded Elon tweet to blow it (Dogecoin) up.” The analyst added that Dogecoin has “great liquidity/low downside relative to other memes.” Featured image from Getty Images, chart from TradingView",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,ALTCOIN | BUSINESS | DOGE | SHIB | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin-whales-buy-112-million-worth-of-doge-as-crypto-investors-turn-their-attention-to-meme-coins/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

28761109,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=610937,1717243237,$2.5 Billion In Bitcoin Flows Out Of Centralized Exchanges – Time To Buy?,"Investor confidence appears to be on the rise in the crypto market lately, and Bitcoin has been a major beneficiary of this positive trend. Consequently, there has been a continuous accumulation of BTC amongst large-scale investors despite its somewhat frustrating price action. The premier cryptocurrency’s price may have ended May beneath the psychological $70,000 mark, despite having touched the level a couple of times in the last two weeks of the month. The latest on-chain data suggests that the faith in Bitcoin has only continued to grow strong. Is BTC Primed For A Price Rally? Prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared via a post on the X platform that substantial amounts of Bitcoin have been making their way out of centralized exchanges. This on-chain observation is based on the CryptoQuant Exchange Reserve metric, which tracks the amount of a particular cryptocurrency in the wallets of all centralized exchanges. Related Reading: Only 8 Altcoins Have Broken ATH Against Bitcoin Since FTX’s Collapse – Analyst Weighs In An increase in the metric’s value indicates that investors are making more deposits than withdrawals of a crypto asset (Bitcoin, in this scenario) into centralized exchanges. Meanwhile, when the metric declines in value, it implies that more coins are moving out than into the trading platforms. According to Martinez’s post, more than 37,000 BTC (worth roughly $2.53 billion) have been transferred out of crypto exchanges in the past three days. This significant exodus of funds indicates a change in sentiment and the long-term holding strategy of Bitcoin investors. While it is difficult to tell the exact rationale behind the massive outflow from exchanges, the movement of funds from trading platforms suggests an increase in investor confidence. This indicates that many investors might be convinced by the future promise of Bitcoin, thereby opting to store their assets in self-custodial wallets in the long term. What’s more, the downward spiral of Bitcoin’s supply on centralized exchanges could trigger a bullish rally for the premier cryptocurrency’s price. The sustained decline in BTC’s balance on exchanges could result in a supply crunch. For context, the supply crunch refers to a scenario or period during which the supply of a particular asset is lower than the demand for it, resulting in a surge in the asset’s value. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of Bitcoin stands around $67,489, reflecting a 1.5% decline in the past 24 hours. This sluggish performance in the past day underscores the premier cryptocurrency’s struggles in the past week. According to CoinGecko’s data, the BTC price is down by nearly 2% in the last seven days.

28757176,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=610941,1717236016,Ethereum Spot ETF: Franklin Templeton Launches Fee War With 0.19% Offer,"Following the abrupt approval of the Ethereum Spot ETFs by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), several prospective issuers have now filed amended versions of their S-1 forms. This development follows an initial directive from the commission that necessitated all asset managers vying to launch an Ether Spot ETF to submit their draft S-1 filings on Friday. Related Reading: Ethereum Investors Take On Sky-High Leverage: Brace For Volatile Storm? Franklin Templeton Opens Floor With 0.19% Sponsor Fee Among the many S-1 amendments received by the SEC on Friday, Top asset management firm Franklin Templeton caught many spectators’ attention after becoming the first potential issuer of the Ethereum Spot ETF to reveal a sponsor fee. The New York-based investment firm aims to charge a 0.19% fee on its Ether spot ETF if approved. Therefore, for every $1,000 invested in this fund, investors would need to pay $1.90 directed at covering the management and operational expenses with the ETF. In any ETF market, sponsor fees are important factors that serve as incentives in attracting investments. With Franklin Templeton being the first issuer to reveal its sponsor fee, it may serve as a precedent as other asset managers may set figures around this value in a bid to entice investors. Notably, Franklin Templeton also offers the same sponsor fee for its Bitcoin spot ETF which ranks as one of the lowest fees in the specific ETF market. Alongside them, other issuers including VanEcK, Invesco Galaxy, Grayscale, BlackRock, and 21Shares have also turned in their amended S-1 forms to the SEC. While the 19b-4 forms of these ETF applications were approved on May 23, the processing of the S-1 forms remains critical for any form of trading to commence. Notably, this process may be lengthy as the submitted S-1 forms are subject to comments from the Commission, which will likely necessitate further amendments.

According to multiple reports, JPMorgan analysts predict these ETFs can only attract investments of about $3 billion in 2024, which could rise to $6 billion if staking is introduced. For context, the Bitcoin spot ETFs launched in January are currently valued at $13.69 billion according to data from SoSoValue. In a recent interview, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart shared similar sentiments with JPMorgan, highlighting the massive difference in the market cap of Ethereum and Bitcoin. At the time of writing, Ethereum trades at $3.777 with a slight gain of 0.45% in the last 24 hours. In tandem, the asset’s daily trading volume is up by 4.80% and valued at $15.40 billion.

Bitcoin prices displayed a slight decline of 2% over the last 30 days, currently standing at $64,815. The annualized cost on Bitcoin Futures saw a significant reduction to 10%, possibly indicating decreased speculation or lower bullish sentiment in the market. The latest analysis of the Bitcoin ecosystem shows major shifts post-halving, with decreased inscriptions and revenues prompting miners to explore AI and M&A for diversification. Please note that VanEck has exposure to bitcoin. In our May 2024 Bitcoin ChainCheck, we dive deeper into the shifts within the Bitcoin ecosystem following the recent halving event. This month's analysis observes a major pullback in inscriptions (-79%) and Bitcoin mining revenues (-49%). In response to the tougher operating environment, the network's total hash rate fell 4% in the month, and Bitcoin mining equities fell 9%. Such challenges are leading many miners to either explore AI applications or M&A to achieve diversification or more scale. Some takeaways for May 2024: Bitcoin's Price Action Market sentiment: Bitcoin prices displayed a slight decline of 2% over the last 30 days, currently standing at $64,815. Despite this minor setback, BTC is still up 136% y/y. Regional trading: Post-halving adjustments and ETF availability have brought distinct changes in regional market behaviors, with Bitcoin exhibiting clear relative strength during U.S. trading hours. MoM Change (%) YoY Change (%) Asia Hours Price Change MoM ($) -4 8 U.S. hours Price Change 4 82 EU hours Price Change -2 41 Source: Glassnode, as of 5/28/24. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Funding rates: The annualized cost on Bitcoin Futures saw a significant reduction to 10%, possibly indicating decreased speculation or lower bullish sentiment in the market. Bitcoin's Network Activity, Adoption, and Fees Daily transactions: There has been a notable increase of 20% this month in transactions, likely due to ongoing re-adjustments post-halving. Such activity is in the 98th percentile of activity. Ordinal inscriptions: A steep 79% reduction in daily inscriptions has occurred, suggesting a strong market shift away from these assets. Total transfer volume: Total transfer value across the network decreased by 13% to $44.60 billion, albeit still maintaining robust activity metrics in the 85th percentile of all-time history. Average transaction fees: Fees experienced a dramatic downturn of 78%, averaging $3.68, which points to decreased network congestion as inscriptions have dwindled. Bitcoin Market Health and Profitability Percent of addresses in profit : A slight drop was noted, with 93% of addresses remaining in profit. As we have noted, when this number reaches 100% after a multi-year gap, as it did in January, Bitcoin tends to make repeated all-time highs in the subsequent year. Net unrealized profit/loss: This ratio decreased to 0.56, interpreting a cautious yet not overly pessimistic sentiment. Bitcoin Miners Total daily BTC miner revenues : Miners faced a sharp revenue drop of 49% to $30.83 million, reflecting the impacts of lower transaction fees and mining rewards post-halving. We have noticed some recent M&A among Bitcoin miners, with U.S.-listed RIOT making a bid for Canadian Bitfarms ( BITF ) after accumulating a 10% stake in the open market, which follows the closing of Hut8 Mining's purchase of US Bitcoin late last year.

Recent data from Messari paints a picture of a network brimming with activity – daily active addresses surging nearly 120%, new user sign-ups exploding by 70%, and daily transactions reaching a staggering 4 million. Yet, beneath this bustling surface lies a troubling undercurrent: a 19% drop in quarterly revenue compared to the previous quarter, and a hefty 40% decline year-over-year. Related Reading: Ethereum Bloodbath: Over $55 Million In Longs Liquidated As Price Plummets Polygon: A Network On Fire Polygon’s user base is clearly smitten. The first quarter of 2024 witnessed a land rush, with new addresses flocking to the network at an unprecedented rate. This surge in user adoption translated into a transaction frenzy, with daily interactions on the platform quadrupling. The decentralized finance (DeFi) sector on Polygon also thrived, with the total value locked (TVL) in DeFi projects climbing 30% compared to the previous quarter. The non-fungible token (NFT) ecosystem on Polygon also got a shot in the arm, with sales volume rising by nearly 20%. The Revenue Riddle So, why the long face amidst the celebratory confetti? The answer lies in Polygon’s dwindling revenue stream. Despite the exponential growth in activity, the network’s coffers are taking a hit. The $7 million earned in Q1 2024 pales in comparison to the $10 million and $12 million raked in during the previous quarter and the same period last year, respectively. This disconnect between booming activity and declining revenue is the million-dollar question that has analysts scratching their heads. MATIC market cap currently at $6.8 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Fee Fiasco Or Funding Flux? There are two main suspects behind this revenue paradox. The first culprit could be Polygon’s transaction fee structure. Perhaps, in a bid to attract more users, the network lowered its fees to an extent that, despite the massive increase in transactions, the overall revenue generation suffered. Another possibility lies in a potential shift in Polygon’s revenue sources. Maybe there was a decline in income from a specific source, such as grants or partnerships, that wasn’t adequately compensated for by growth in other areas. Related Reading: Can DEX Boom Save Cardano? ADA Seeks Recovery As Trading Activity Surges Christian Encila Christian Encila 22 hours ago 2 mins read What Lies Ahead Polygon faces a critical juncture. The network’s ability to attract users and foster a vibrant DeFi and NFT ecosystem is undeniable. However, if it fails to address the revenue conundrum, its long-term sustainability could be at risk. Moving forward, transparency from Polygon regarding its fee structure and revenue streams will be crucial in assuaging investor concerns. Additionally, exploring alternative revenue models, such as offering premium services or strategic partnerships, could be the key to unlocking Polygon’s full financial potential.

However, investors hope for a seismic explosion to impulse Altcoins to new highs. Related Reading: Lil Pump-And-Dump: SEC Issues Warning As More Musicians Dump Their Memecoins As the crypto industry awaits, online reports revealed that, since FTX’s fall, only eight altcoins have hit a new all-time high (ATH) against Bitcoin. A crypto analyst shared his thoughts on the matter. Altcoins Underperforming Against Bitcoin This Cycle On Friday, Crypto analyst Miles Deutscher shared an interesting fact about the crypto market. Since November 2022, just eight altcoins have broken their previous ATH against the flagship cryptocurrency. To achieve this feat, tokens include Render (RNDR), Tellor (TRB), Injective (INJ), Astar (ASTR), SSV Network (SSV), SingularityNET (AGIX), True Wallet Token (TWT), and Binance Coin (BNB). It’s worth noting that RNDR was the latest one to accomplish this on March 11 and that the list only contains altcoins launched before FTX’s collapse. Deutscher explained that despite his initial shock, the news made sense to him and highlighted some takeaways based on the singularities of this run. First, the analyst considers that asset selection dynamics changed from previous cycles. Investors have been “punished” for being overexposed to certain sectors like L2 and gaming and “rewarded” for participating in others like Memecoins and AI. In contrast, in the last cycle, “you could basically bet on anything and beat $BTC.” According to the analyst, the market will likely continue experiencing specific sector outperformance despite the retail liquidity injection. He also explained that “crypto is an attention economy,” and money will flow where attention is. As a result, even the projects with the best technology won’t perform if there isn’t an exciting reason to buy. Deutscher’s second takeaway highlights the market’s current ATH dilution. As he points out, thousands of new products are being launched daily, and “low float/high FDV VC coins are launching in the billions.” These launches are seemingly outpacing the new liquidity, resulting in Altcoins struggling with performance. More Room To Catch Up The analyst’s third point explains that the bull run has been led by Bitcoin and spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETH). Based on this, he considers it unsurprising that altcoins have “hardly pumped” so far. Various crypto analysts and experts share this opinion. Alex Krüger previously stated that the cycle has been “almost entirely” driven by the Bitcoin ETFs’ momentum. Deutscher sees Altcoins’ underperformance as a bullish signal since Bitcoin’s dominance has been instrumental in previous cycles. To him, this performance allows “more room to play catch up” and could drive altcoins to unseen highs. Related Reading: Is Solana Preparing For Liftoff Or Meltdown? Analysts Forecast SOL’s Future The analyst believes the market needs another catalyst for a true Altcoins season. Despite this, he highlights that many investors have had a record Q1 “even in mildly bullish conditions for most alts.” Ultimately, Deutscher considers there is still room to make big profits this cycle “even without the face-melting altseason we all crave.” Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",NEUTRAL,BTC | SSV,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | SSV,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/only-8-altcoins-have-broken-ath-against-bitcoin-since-ftxs-collapse-analyst-weighs-in/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

28738783,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=610933,1717200000,UNI Price Slides 8% As Uniswap Delays Crucial Voting Proposal,"In a blow to the momentum of the Uniswap native token, UNI, the decentralized exchange (DEX) has been forced to postpone a highly anticipated proposal that would have improved its token governance and fee distribution model. Meanwhile, the company is also locked in a legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over the regulatory status of its UNI token. Postponed UNI Governance Upgrade Sparks Sell-off On Friday, the Uniswap Foundation announced that it was delaying the deployment of the first proposal to activate Uniswap Protocol Governance. The foundation cited the need for additional due diligence on “a new issue” raised by a stakeholder, underscoring the sensitivity of the proposed upgrade. The Foundation further stated: This was unexpected, and we apologize for the postponement. We will keep the community apprised of any material changes and will update you all once we feel more certain about future timeframes. Related Reading: Market Analysis: How Will Mt. Gox’s Bitcoin Distribution Affect Crypto Prices? The shelved proposal aimed to streamline Uniswap’s fee mechanisms, allowing UNI token holders who have staked and delegated their tokens to be rewarded. It would have increased the efficiency of fee adjustments and reduced the governance burden on delegates while maintaining the protocol’s “credible neutrality.” The delay has had a tangible impact on UNI’s price, as seen in the token’s daily UNI/USD chart above. The token has slid down to the key support level at $10.20—an 8.6% decline in the past 24 hours. Should the token fail to regain bullish momentum and the $10 support level, it could retrace further to $9.66 and potentially as low as $9.33. Uniswap In High-Stakes Showdown With SEC Adding to Uniswap’s challenges, the company is embroiled in a high-stakes legal battle with the SEC. The regulatory agency has issued a Wells Notice to Uniswap Labs, signaling its intent to recommend enforcement action against the firm. Uniswap Labs has pushed back, arguing that the SEC’s case is flawed and fails to recognize the distinction between tokens as stores of value and tokens as securities. The company has expressed confidence in a favorable outcome, noting that its legal team has a strong track record of victories against the SEC, stating: But we’re prepared to fight. Our lawyers are 2-0 in high-profile SEC cases. Andrew Ceresney, a former head of enforcement at the SEC, represented Ripple in their victory over the SEC. Don Verrilli, a former U.S. solicitor general, has argued more than 50 cases before the U.S. Supreme Court and represented Grayscale in its successful case against the SEC.

Moreover, CoinGecko data shows that the UNI token’s trading volume has increased by 21.5% over the past 24 hours, reaching $264 million. As the Uniswap community awaits updates on the delayed governance proposal and the outcome of the SEC battle, the platform’s long-term prospects will likely hinge on its ability to navigate these challenges and maintain its position in the market.
