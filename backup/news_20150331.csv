42378115,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7M9m9,1427839211,BitGo Names New CEO in Leadership Shake-Up,"BitGo announced today that co-founder Mike Belshe will replace Will O'Brien as acting CEO of the bitcoin security provider.  Calling the move ""the best path forward"", Belshe suggested that the transition was put in place by the BitGo's remaining founders, including both himself and Ben Davenport, and that O'Brien will continue working with the company as a strategic advisor.  In an interview, Belshe framed the appointment as one that would allow him to take BitGo into its ""next phase"" of development, while continuing his efforts to align the company toward a common vision.  Belshe told CoinDesk:  ""It has always been my baby and I think I've always had the core vision for the company.""  Belshe indicated that O'Brien will remain a shareholder of the company, and that his role as a strategic advisor will include acting as a ""public face"" for the company at future events.  O'Brien is one of the latest bitcoin executives to be replaced as CEO, following Blockchain's Nic Cary and BitPay's Tony Gallippi, who now act as co-founder and chairman at their respective companies.  Ready to lead  Throughout the talk, Belshe framed BitGo as a personal project, one that required the expertise of an individual with business acumen like O'Brien who could help the company grow while he helped focus the company on its foundational technology.  ""I started BitGo before I even really knew it was going to go toward the company it is today. It started out of securing bitcoins for friends,"" Belshe recalled.  O'Brien joined the company in December 2013, after working informally with Belshe for a few months prior to this time. ""He brought a lot of business side skills. I was looking for someone to take that side of the company,"" he continued.  Still, Belshe framed the move as one that would find him extending his interior leadership of the company out to the general community, concluding:  ""We have a lot of platforms coming out and we think that this is going to work better for us. I think the timing is good for us as a company.""

42378117,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7M9nP,1427832022,Overstock Invests $5 Million in Peernova in First Bitcoin Investment,"US retail giant Overstock has invested in blockchain technology specialist Peernova as part of its second tranche of Series A financing.  Formed through a merger between cloud mining contract provider CloudHashing and ASIC hardware designer HighBitcoin in early 2014, Peernova raised $8.6m in funding last December as it sought to accelerate its shift away from mining.  In statements, general manager of Overstock's Cryptocurrencies Group Judd Bagley framed Overstock's first investment in a bitcoin industry firm as a vote of confidence in the decentralized ledger-based technologies Peernova is currently building.  Bagley told CoinDesk:  ""PeerNova is precisely the kind of company we’re eager to back up. Their team is brilliant and agile and the products they have in the works are going to change the way business is done forever. They get the transformative nature of the blockchain.""  Overstock invested $5m in the firm, a decision approved by its board of directors and that will be announced it in its next quarterly report to stockholders.  Peernova indicated that the funding has increased its total to-date financing to $19m in equity and debt financing.  Company representatives suggested the first entries in its new line of projects, focused on data security and finance, are to be released soon.  Venture interest  Bagley went on to suggest that Overstock is currently seeking to expand its venture finance investments in blockchain and decentralised ledger-based technology providers.  ""We’re completely bought into the idea that decentralized ledgers will play a significant role in business going forward,"" Bagley said, adding that the company believes the technology could disrupt entire business verticals.  Bagley cited Medici, the decentralised stock exchange announced by Overstock in 2014, as an example of a project with such ambitious goals.  ""There’s a huge opportunity to disrupt entire segments of the business ecosystem, particularly in cases where intermediaries introduce substantial frictional and transaction costs,"" he continued.  Medici is currently being developed as part of a special division at Overstock, though the project's original developers, Counterparty's Robby Dermody and Evan Wagner, have since departed to start financial market platform Symbiont.  Brand struggles  While Peernova has attracted new investment, evidence suggests its older line of products continues to suffer from a poor reputation in the general market.  Though the HighBitcoin brand was discontinued, CloudHashing continues to attract criticisms from the wider community. At press time, its website is inactive.  A Twitter search for CloudHashing's handle reveals a small but vocal group of former investors who are seeking to get in touch with the company.  Further, Reddit forums details customers who report both losing money on mining contracts, and being asked to pay money to end services.  CoinDesk has contacted Peernova for more information but did not receive an immediate response.

42378111,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7M9h7,1427824208,Exclusive: Silk Road Agent Gave Bitcoin Tax Advice Prior to Arrest,"""I’m a proponent of bitcoin and hope it does succeed and take over the monetary system of the world.""  Months after the closure of the infamous online black market Silk Road and the arrest of Ross Ulbricht, it seems bitcoin still held the attention of former Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) special agent Carl Mark Force IV.  Overnight, Force has become a sensation in the bitcoin world for his alleged improprieties while serving with the US federal agency. Along with Shaun Bridges, a former US Secret Service agent, Force has been charged with money laundering and fraud, while separately being slapped with allegations that he stole government property while undercover.  In court documents unsealed yesterday, the duo are said to have misused hundreds of thousands of dollars in funds as part of the Baltimore-based investigation to apprehend Dread Pirate Roberts (DPR), the leader of Silk Road later determined to be Ulbricht.  However, evidence suggests Force, who was employed as a DEA special agent for 15 years until his resignation in May 2014, continued to interact with the bitcoin community after the black market was closed.  Force opened up to CoinDesk contributor Carrie Kirby in a conversation that took place in 2014. Kirby described Force as surprisingly chatty (using emoticons frequently) and willing to disclose information despite his role as an undercover DEA.  It was on this subject that Force made his expertise available to CoinDesk, something he also did to the wider bitcoin community through posts on Bitcoin Talk – a widely trafficked forum where he offered tax help services.  ""I work full-time for the DEA ... but also I'm a CPA,"" Force explained. ""I've developed quite a knowledge of bitcoin. I was just throwing it out there to see if people needed help with it.""  Though he began his career with the DEA in September 1999 and served in its Denver, Puerto Rico and Baltimore offices, Force was also a certified public accountant (CPA) in Baltimore, online records show.  Force attested that while he didn't have clients as a CPA, he did freely give guidance to about 10 potential customers in the community, something he seemed opened to parlaying into profit-making opportunities. ""It could turn into that,"" he added.  Fear and money laundering  Force's comments are not without a certain irony given his recent high-profile arrest, as he openly discussed his belief that bitcoin-to-bitcoin transactions were harder for US authorities to trace, among other topics.  The former DEA agent seemed to believe that the real problems would arise once bitcoin was brought into ""the world of the central banking authority and central government"".  Force spoke about the confusion surrounding the digital currency, stating:  ""The concern from law enforcement is that they’re very uninformed about it and they think this is only used by crooks for money laundering and drug dealers because of Silk Road.""  Remaining seemingly positive, Force then went on to speak against this narrative. ""That’s not true. It’s becoming more accepted and gaining more media attention,"" he said.  Still, he discussed the environment of uncertainty around the topic.  ""The average american will want to comply, partly out of fear,"" he concluded.  Lack of guidance  On Bitcoin Talk, Force was open about his work, sharing his personal information to those who wished to contact him and proposing a 1 BTC fee per session.  Most of his prospective clients, he said, were early bitcoin investors.  ""There are so many people who mined from the beginning and accumulated a substantial amount. People started saying 'What am I going to do with it?' There’s so little guidance, from so many different countries. I don’t think the IRS [Internal Revenue Service] has offered any kind of guidance.""  In terms of advising how these individuals should proceed, Force suggested they could be careful or aggressive depending on their risk appetite.  ""There are a lot of gray areas,"" he explained. ""Of course, maybe you are going to get audited. But you have arguments if you’re going to be aggressive. Some people want to make sure that they’re not going to have any problems at all, that they report everything and report all gains to the IRS.""  Force implied that more aggressive actions, such as withholding information from the federal tax collection agency, were not recommendable . Here again, he talked about the pitfalls that could arise when transferring funds between bitcoin and fiat.  “You’ve involved the US government, now you’re trading in their currency. If you make a large transfer from Bitstamp or whatever that could get flagged. If you’re going to do that you’re going to have to put that on there, that it’s not a currency it’s more of a commodity,"" Force said.  The comments are notable given Force's own difficulties with the European-based bitcoin exchange, which flagged his account repeatedly on suspicions relating to his activities with allegedly ill-gotten funds.  Profit potential  Force also spoke at length about the subject of bitcoin's ability to generate financial returns.  ""Nothing is matching the returns bitcoin is giving right now,"" he said, adding that due to this factor, taxpayers would be wise to cite bitcoin as the reason for their increase in income.  ""They know there are no stocks out there that are crushing it at that level. My advice there would be to tell them this is bitcoin. I would write that right on the form,"" he continued.  Force discussed whether bitcoin spending could be taxable, and suggested he believed Overstock was keeping records of its spending.  ""You could make an argument that you had appreciation on this you have to recognize capital gains tax,"" he said in what amounts to a prediction of actions taken by the IRS in March 2014.  The issue, he said, was that in the beginning, many bitcoin users didn't keep detailed records of their transactions. Further, he questioned how much of this information was recoverable.  Ultimately, he suggested that he suspected many US citizens wouldn't report this income at all, recalling his now-apparent history and expertise with dark markets.  ""If you're gonna go on Tor, the black Internet, the people on there are not going to be asking advice on how to file their taxes,"" he said, concluding:  ""Your crooks and drug dealers are not going to comply at all.""  Force, the affidavit alleges, was blocked from bitcoin exchange Bitstamp after his use of Tor was flagged by the company's AML procedures.  Though a firm total was not given for Force's alleged illicit haul, investigators suggest he paid off his mortgage, wrote lavish checks and ""wired hundreds of thousands of dollars"" as evidence of the extent of his improper actions.  Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated the conversations contained in this interview occurred over multiple sessions.  Force was contacted for comment but no response has been received at press time.  Carrie Kirby co-authored this report.

42378100,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7M9Vn,1427802970,Only 2.3% of Americans in Survey Trust Bitcoin Transfers Overseas,"Only 2.3% of Americans would trust bitcoin to send funds overseas in an emergency, according to a new survey by the Digital Currency Council.  By contrast, 30.3% of the 750 ""regular Americans"" sampled would trust their banks to make international transfers.  23% of the people surveyed said that they would use Western Union, whilst 22% thought Paypal was more trustworthy.  MoneyGram  would be used by 6% and the Postal Service by 10% of those questioned.  Commenting on the results, David Berger, CEO of the Digital Currency Council, which runs a series of 'Pulse Reports' on public perceptions of digital currency, said:  ""While bitcoin transactions may not technically require trust between parties, it is clear that consumers place their faith in institutions to send money.""  He concluded that earning consumers' trust would be critical to driving the widespread adoption of bitcoin.  Interestingly, 37.2% of those surveyed said that they would not trust any of the aforementioned money transfer options.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC,Yessi Bello Perez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/03/31/only-23-of-americans-in-survey-trust-bitcoin-transfers-overseas,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png
