42404450,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdiDq3,1586465213,Profit-Taking Keeps Bitcoin in Tight Range as Fed Reopens Spigot,"Bitcoin and ether fell slightly Thursday as traditional markets climbed on additional stimulus measures by the U.S. Federal Reserve and Bank of England.      Over the past 24 hours, bitcoin (BTC) was down 1 percent Thursday afternoon New York time and ether (ETH) was down 1.2 percent.      Notable gainers on CoinDesk’s big board include dash (DASH) up 8 percent, zcash (ZEC) in the green 8 percent and bitcoin gold (BTG) climbing 4 percent. Digital assets in the red include bitcoin cash (BCH) down 4 percent, tron (TRON) dropping 2 percent and cardano (ADA) slipping 1 percent. All 24-hour price changes are as of 20:15 UTC (4:15 p.m. EDT) Thursday.      In the traditional markets, Asia’s Nikkei 225 index closed flat, down a miniscule 0.04 percent. Japan central bank Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said Thursday that uncertainty about his country’s economic outlook is “extremely high.”      Europe’s FTSE 100 ended the day up 2.9 percent as the Bank of England extended an existing agreement to bankroll the U.K. economy.      Read more: Bitcoin Garners New Users as Governments Flood World With Fiat      In the U.S., the S&P 500 closed New York’s trading day up 1.4 percent. The Federal Reserve announced new stimulus measures to contain the economic fallout from the continuing coronavirus pandemic.      The central bank rolled out a program worth $2.3 trillion, including a ""Main Street Lending Fund"" of $600 billion to offer support to small and medium-sized businesses, and $500 billion in lending to states and municipalities.      The Fed also expanded the size and scope of the Primary and Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facilities and the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility to support as much as $850 billion in credit.      After the Fed announced the new measures, bitcoin rebounded from an intraday low of $7,100, quickly reversing a steep decline. It’s currently trading in a sideways range around the $7,200 level.       Stocks, particularly in the U.S., are seeing gains this week. But there’s some doubt whether this can last. “U.S. stocks will still be in a very precarious situation in April as the ongoing pandemic remains far from over,” said Toby Wu, a senior analyst for multi-asset brokerage eToro.      Since taking a beating in mid-March, bitcoin had been steadily climbing, driven by predictions that new-money injections from governments and central banks around the world would eventually spur inflation. Bitcoin is often touted as a hedge against inflation and many analysts say it will benefit one way or another from the unconventional methods adopted by the Fed to combat the coronavirus-led slowdown. If it’s a risk asset, as skeptics see it, bitcoin should rise along with other high-yielding instruments; if it’s truly the haven adherents claim it to be, it should attract investment for that reason.      Read more: What’s Next for Bitcoin After March’s Crash – CoinDesk Quarterly Review      Perhaps supporting inflationary concerns, foreign exchange traders dumped the U.S. dollar Thursday, sending the dollar index, which tracks the value of the greenback against other major currencies, down to 99.50 from 100.00. Elsewhere, gold, a classic haven asset and hedge against inflation, is currently trading up at 2.4 percent.      So why isn’t the bellwether cryptocurrency soaring on the latest intervention announcements? Profit-taking was the name of the game Thursday, market participants said.      “Crypto should be higher based on those large moves in conventional markets. However, we have seen net selling today. Traders are taking profit,” said Max Boonen, CEO of B2C2, a London-based over-the-counter (OTC) market maker.      This selling seems to be keeping bitcoin stuck in the $7,200 range.      “The recent weeks’ rally appears to have temporarily stalled at about $7,400, but the bullish outlook for bitcoin remains intact over the next one to 12 months,” said Greg Cipolaro, cofounder of Digital Asset Research, a cryptocurrency-analysis firm.

The Cayman Island-based developer house announced Wednesday that, having watched EOS develop over the past two years, it now thinks the time is right for it to come off the sidelines and begin actively contributing to the network.      ""Hundreds of BPs [block producers] and SBPs [standby block producers] have contributed a tremendous amount of code, knowledge, and leadership. Initially, in the coming weeks, we plan to use our voting stake to begin highlighting and voting for many of these candidates, potentially even in rotation, to showcase these organizations' achievements, values, and network contributions,"" the post said, referring to block producers and standby block producers.      See also: Block.one Absorbs Team Behind Now-Defunct Block Producer EOS New York      Block.one has been looking to participate since a month after the network launched in June 2018. In a July post that year, the company said it would vote for block producers, though this did not happen.      Block.One announced its intention to begin participating in governance in November. At the time, the company said it wanted to play a ""proportional role"" in suggesting new proposals as well as supporting projects and teams contributing to the overall health of the network.      Following the $4 billion initial coin offering (ICO), Block.one allocated itself 10 percent of the total EOS (EOS) token supply. But its share has slowly declined as new EOS tokens have entered the ecosystem from BPs validating new blocks. Eighteen months after the ICO, in November 2019, the company's share was down to 9.5 percent.      As of press time, Block.one's control of approximately 9.5 percent of eos coins would make it potentially a major single voter for any block producer (the 21 validators with the largest portion of tokens supporting them), depending on how much of its holdings the company decides to stake and vote.      See also: Block.One Will Not Launch Its Social Network on EOS      Per Wednesday's release, Block.one said it would begin playing an active role first by vocally supporting BPs that have already added code, and it will support block producers who ""adhere to the standards we wish to see network wide,"" the company said.      ""Block.one believes staking systems will be a critical component of the future tokenized economy, and to ensure maximum network security and constructive participation, Block.one will begin staking and voting its EOS token position,"" the company added.      Brady Dale contributed reporting.      Edit (13:30 UTC, April 13, 2020): A previous version of this story overstated the impact that Block.One's supply of tokens could potentially have on EOS.

42404443,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdiDiB,1586459131,Bitcoin Garners New Users as Governments Flood World With Fiat,"Governments around the world are careening toward a period of dramatic spending.      The U.S. Federal Reserve announced another $2.3 trillion in lending programs on Thursday to stabilize America’s coronavirus-stricken economy. The Bank of England announced it would likely extend billions of pounds to directly finance the government’s crisis response.      All this inspires inflation concerns around the globe, which appear to be driving demand for bitcoin (BTC) in some corners.      “The non-stop quantitative easing process will finally impact the mid-term and long-term market,” said Danny Deng, a leading member of both the China Blockchain Application Center and the National Internet Finance Association of China. “Bitcoin is designed for this kind of situation. So I’m optimistic about bitcoin's future.”      China is also expected to announce a stimulus package of its own. Deng said he expects the People’s Bank of China to use a digital currency to distribute a stimulus package, which he sees as a complementary catalyst to the bitcoin mining industry.      While central banks continue printing money, there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin. The halving of bitcoin miners’ block rewards is scheduled for May in what some are calling an act of quantitative tightening.      Read more: Bitcoin Halving, Explained      Broadly speaking, dozens of nations are reevaluating which currencies and industries they depend on. Bitcoin fits into this broader spectrum as some nations with strong central governments, like China, shore up hard assets and digital infrastructure. Meanwhile, there has been a surge in retail crypto investors from nations with unstable currencies, such as Argentina and Russia.      “We see that interest in cryptocurrencies has grown significantly in Russia … due to the economic situation in the country,” said Gleb Kostarev, Binance’s head of operations in Russia. “The ruble has tumbled a lot in 2020. In addition, authorities are introducing a new tax on income from bank deposits from next year, which encourages people to withdraw funds from banks.”      Bitcoin is hardly the most important asset in the broader economic turndown. However, recent bitcoin trends highlight the local impact of global developments. In places where distrust of banks historically runs high, many households now consider bitcoin among the assets they trust more than the local fiat currency.    Speculator's market    Some critics may see decline in bitcoin’s wild volatility during the start of the coronavirus economic crisis, including what crypto traders called Black Thursday.      But the institutional sell-off and subsequent trading rush stimulated more diverse distribution, usage and liquidity options, all while making crypto companies a hefty profit.      Marius Reitz, general manager at the African crypto exchange Luno, said there was a 25 percent increase in new signups during Q1 2020 compared to Q4 2019. This includes “thousands” of new users from Nigeria, South Africa, Zambia and Uganda. He added there was a 100 percent increase in trading across the continent.      “People saw an opportunity to recover some of their earlier [traditional market] losses in bitcoin,” Reitz said. “It’s very much still a speculator’s market.”      Reitz said March witnessed a stronger correlation between gold and bitcoin trades in African markets as well. Overall, it appears bitcoin distribution diversified during the coronavirus downturn.      According to the asset manager and research firm Bitwise, nearly all exchanges experienced an increase in volume during March. North American exchanges including Coinbase, Kraken and Gemini saw the most growth in trading volumes. Kraken’s bitcoin strategist, Pierre Rochard, said the exchange saw a 300 percent increase in new users getting verified in March, compared to the previous month.      “These are new users who didn’t have any crypto beforehand,” Rochard said.      Fiat-denominated prices aren’t the only way to measure bitcoin’s performance. The number of active bitcoin wallet addresses is now comparable to metrics during the sky-high prices of September 2017, according to Coin Metrics, which estimated roughly 770,915 active accounts on March 30, 2020 compared to 718,184 on Sept. 29, 2017.      Although the price of bitcoin briefly dropped 40 percent, down from $9,160 in early March, it recovered to roughly $7,300 as of press time. As such, Luno’s Reitz said bitcoin suffered less of an impact, and recovered faster, than many other asset classes.      Institutions that sold off in early March quickly bought back in, according to Diogo Monica, co-founder of crypto custody firm Anchorage. Plus, BitGo CEO Mike Belshe said his custody startup saw such high demand for bullish loans in March that he will double the size of the team handling crypto loans. Exchanges and custodians are actually making more profit during the recession.      Read more: Retail Investors Are Buying the Bitcoin Institutions Are Selling, Traders Say      When the market crashed, speculative crypto trading and demand for custody options soared. Ledger CEO Pascal Gauthier said hardware wallet sales saw “double-digit growth” in Q1 2020 compared to the same time last year, with sales still accelerating.      “We are increasing our hardware [wallet] production as a result,” Gauthier added.      As speculative traders rush in, Latin Americans increasingly turn to bitcoin for savings and loans.    Latin America    “The main usage is to save. … People are seeking safety,” said Ripio CEO Sebastian Serrano, whose Latin American company offers both crypto loans and an exchange. “Argentina was on the brink of default and that happened on Sunday.”      Argentina isn’t the only country to default, either. Lebanon, Ecuador and Venezuela are also on the brink. Bitcoiners in Lebanon often focus on savings because they, like Latin Americans, share a distrust in banks.      Cryptobuyer CEO Jorge Luis Farias said orders for crypto point-of-sale (POS) devices doubled in March, mostly in Venezuela. He’s also shipping three new bitcoin ATMs to Chile, where the local currency hit a historic low in March.      Subsequently, by the first week of April, Chilean activity on LocalBitcoins reached an all-time high of $371,063.      “More people are looking for options to receive payments,” Farias said on April 7. “We received 100 new [POS device] requests only last week.”      According to fellow Venezuelan expatriate Mauricio Di Bartolomeo, co-founder of the crypto loan startup Ledn, Mexican and Argentinian users are driving growth on his platform with bitcoin savings accounts. Even including bitcoin-collateralized loans for dollars or stablecoins, Latin Americans now make up 60 percent of new Ledn user accounts in 2020, he said, compared to around 16 percent from North America. His user base, with “thousands” of people, doubled over the last six months.    “I think the economic situation has to do with it, in Argentina and Mexico. Mexico had a run-up in exchange-ratehttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/mexican-peso-leads-global-drop-200927928.html disparity,” Bartolomeo said. “We expect to see a lot of demand from Latin America to save in options that aren’t their local currency.”    If the rate of bitcoin savings and reliable loans remain steady throughout the broader economic crisis, that may arguably be a more bullish signal than fiat-denominated price increases.    Asian alliance    Meanwhile, several Asian nations are reacting to the recession by increasing their economic interdependence.      The Shanghai Cooperation Organization with China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan agreed in March to work with local currencies, instead of U.S. dollars, when conducting bilateral trade and issuing bonds. Deng said the Chinese government aims to make its currency regional tender, “then a global currency” like dollars.      “China’s national digital currency will accelerate this process,” he added.      The crypto industry could provide the infrastructure for this distribution. Kazakhstani entrepreneur Tilektes Adambekov said in April he is still working to launch a regional crypto exchange that will eventually include “fiat trading and security tokens,” although these aren’t plans specifically focused on China’s digital currency.      Read more: Notes From the WEF: Oil-Producing Nations Want Dollar Alternatives, Just Not Bitcoin      “This region will accommodate global initiatives under the ‘Belt and Road’ global development strategy,” Adambekov said during a meeting with Chinese business associates in January.      As for bitcoin itself, traders from the above-mentioned markets sometimes liquidate their crypto by investing in real estate, especially now that oil and bond markets are highly volatile.    Middle East    Gold, oil and real estate investments appear to increase, along with bitcoin transactions, when stocks and bonds dip.      Arms & McGregor International Realty CEO Makram Hani said his company is working to close a Dubai property purchase, worth $140 million, using multiple cryptocurrencies from a single Asian buyer.      Out of the hundreds of prospective customers who expressed interest in potentially buying real estate with cryptocurrency, Hani said the most popular property locations are Dubai, London and Berlin. It appears bitcoiners in nations with increased surveillance may be seeking a liquidity hedge with traditional assets, while others in the Middle East are willing to accept large amounts of cryptocurrency.      “We have seen a significant growth in real estate transactions that have been paid for, in one way or another, with funds originating as bitcoin or other currencies,” Hani said.      Rain co-founder Yehia Badawy, who also serves bitcoiners in Dubai via his Bahrain-based exchange, said trading volumes increased 200 percent from January to March 2020, with 34 percent more new user signups driven by “high-volume retail.”      “People are still trying to figure out how permanent the [economic] changes will be,” Badawy said.      Read more: Geopolitical Crisis May Benefit Oil, Gold and CBDCs, Not Bitcoin      Due to the oil market slump, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and Qatar have struggled to retain investor confidence in their debts. The oil market collapse could have more dire impacts on weaker states like Lebanon and Iraq, which were already saddled with crippling foreign debts before the pandemic hit.      Mikhail Kholodov, an oil market expert at MOL-Russ LLC, described the global market these days as “all speculation” and “hot money in a casino-like arrangement” that won’t regain balance “anytime soon.” When spooked investors diversify, some now rank bitcoin alongside tangible investments like gold or real estate.

Canaan Creative's losses in 2019 are a continuation of the major mining manufacturer's declining profitability over the past three years. While its machines secure 20 percent of the Bitcoin network, Canaan is a market leader in an industry subject to volatile price swings, ever-changing miner incentives, and fast-paced technological advancement. This is to say nothing of Bitcoin's programmable ""halving"" expected in 34 days, which will essentially cut miner's paychecks in half.      You're reading Blockchain Bites, the daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news, and why they're significant. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk's newsletters here. Here's the story:    Top shelf    Mining hurdles    Canaan Creative, a Chinese mining manufacturer, saw a net loss of $148.6 million in 2019 on revenue of $204.3 million, reflecting declining profitability over the past three years. Since its $90 million IPO, Canaan's share price has been on a downward trend and is currently 61 percent below its offering price. Still, the firm's machines are responsible for securing 20 percent of the Bitcoin blockchain network, opening the question of how Bitcoin’s upcoming “halving” will disrupt the complicated economic dance of crypto mining.  Crypto lending platform BlockFi has begun extending credit to miners as competition for their business has eased during the coronavirus crisis. In related news, BlockFi says its monthly revenue has doubled since raising a $30 million Series B round in February. (The Block)      Gains and pain    Activity on Indian crypto exchanges has skyrocketed after the Reserve Bank of India overturned an order blocking crypto companies from securing banking relationships. In early March, crypto banking services platform Cashaa India noted a spike of 800 percent in trading volumes in the 48 hours following the decision. While WazirX has taken on 100 crore rupees ($13 million) in client funds.  Galaxy Digital, Mike Novogratz's crypto merchant bank, reported a net loss of $32.9 million in Q4 2019. The bank’s trading arm incurred the vast majority of losses at more than $32.1 million, wiping out its other revenue streams. Now, Novogratz is saying the COVID-19 pandemic will likely lead to another down quarter.  It's not just companies impacted by COVID-19. Tonga, Haiti and Kyrgyzstan are the countries most affected by falling remittances sparked by the pandemic. (Quartz)    Expansion    Global crypto exchange Huobi Group is eyeing a U.S. return, after abruptly halting operations five months ago. Huobi said it will partner with a local licensed trading platform and potentially buy a stake in an existing brokerage, allowing it to be legally compliant at a lower cost. Data provider Nomics ranks the exchange first by year-to-date volume.    Household names    Household name Fidelity Digital Asset (FDA) is signing on as a member of ErisX’s clearinghouse, taking advantage of the crypto-native firm's technology to provide better liquidity. While OTC desks might massage a price up when connecting a buyer and a seller to maximize their own profit, Erisx’s central order book allows equal access to prices across Fidelity’s customer base.  Fold joined the Visa Fast Track Program to issue a bitcoin (BTC) rewards card instead of traditional points. It’s a “debit card but has the rewards levels you’d expect from a credit card,” Fold CEO Will Reeves said.    Legal action    The U.S Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey is seeking to pause the SEC’s civil action against Blockchain Terminal founder Boaz Manor while it conducts its own criminal case against Manor’s alleged $30 million ICO fraud. Both agencies are prosecuting Manor and his partners’ allegedly fraudulent “BCT” token offering.  Two state securities regulators have ordered Ultra Mining to cease and desist, saying the firm negligently promised to double investments in a cloud mining scheme. The alleged crypto scam is said to have raised $18 million.

The ultimate goal: to prevent it from happening to anyone else.

Of more than 2,000 billionaires on Forbes’ ‘The Richest in 2020’ list, only four are crypto wealthy, “and none of them are named ‘CZ’,” reports Cointelegraph.    The case for decentralization    A series of ongoing efforts across universities, medical academia, the private sector and even private citizens are harnessing distributed systems in the fight against COVID-19. From contact tracing to donating computer processing power, blockchain technology is finding a use case in charitable action.  A DeFi professional describes life under quarantine in COVID-19's epicenter, in a CoinDesk op-ed. When the next crisis comes, he says, blockchain tech will be ready to help.  Decentralized finance advocate “DeFi Dad” has come up with a way for small business owners to supplement their business during the prolonged COVID-19-led period of uncertainty. Using Mintbase and the Ethereum blockchain, restaurants and other mom-and-pop shops can print digital certificates to be sold at a discount, bringing in cash now for the promise of providing services later if-and-when they reopen. Commenters noted this sounds like the Deli Dollar phenomenon of old, but now with token-economics.  Market intel    Bitcoin's break Bitcoin's break above a long-term moving average resistance near $7,100 has strengthened the case for a rally to $8,000. The 200-period average was repeatedly capped in the final days of March, bow that the hurdle has been convincingly crossed, buyers who entered the market earlier this month may also be more comfortable in holding their positions.

42404439,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdiDfE,1586449821,"Telegram's Fight Against SEC Will Help Push Cryptocurrency Legislation, Says Trade Group","Telegram’s ongoing court battle over its $1.7 billion token offering could help move cryptocurrency regulation forward, according to the Blockchain Association.      While unfortunate for Telegram, “I think the outcome of this case can help put pressure on Congress to step in a write a new law that would provide a path forward,” Kristin Smith, executive director of the association, told CoinDesk in an interview.      The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) wants to halt the issuance of tokens for Telegram's blockchain project TON because, the regulator claims, they are unregistered securities.      “We really hope that instead of getting clarity through the court decisions, the SEC through the rulemaking process, or Congress through legislation, will provide a really clear pathway for such projects to be developed and launched,” she added.      That won't happen right now, when everybody's looking for ways to get past the COVID-19 pandemic. Later, however, “there will be an appetite among lawmakers to find ways to support innovations and growing industries as we get to the recovery, and I think we’ll see some positive legislation when that happens,” Smith said.      “When there are national and international challenges like the coronavirus, it’s ultimately the innovation that helps get the economy out of the crisis and moving again,” she added.    Persistent ally    The Blockchain Association – a crypto industry advocacy group with members including Coinbase, Circle, Digital Currency Group, eToro, Anchorage, Kraken, Ripple and others – has been weighing in heavily on the legal fight between Telegram and the SEC.      The SEC asked the court in October to halt the issuance of Telegram's blockchain tokens, called grams, to the investors in its private token sale. The commission recently scored a win when Judge Kevin Castel of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York issued a preliminary injunction blocking the issuance, even for investors outside the U.S.      The Blockchain Association sided with Telegram back in January, asking the court to dismiss the SEC’s allegation. However, Judge Castel didn't follow the reasoning that while the SAFT (simple agreement for future tokens) arrangement was a security offering, the tokens Telegram promised to investors are not. The blockchain association insisted he’s wrong in its second friend-of-the-court brief submitted last week.      See also: Overstock Is Set to Finally Pay Out Its Digital Security Shareholder Dividend      Smith believes by banning the distribution of grams, the SEC is trying to prosecute a nonexistent crime: Telegram’s investors, which are accredited investors only, can find legal ways to sell their tokens if they want to, even without unloading them on general public in the U.S., which the SEC and later the court seek to prevent.      “If grams are actually securities, they can be traded on [alternative trading systems] once the SEC approves it, investors can hold them for a certain period of time and then sell them to private investors, they can sell them on the exchanges overseas,” Smith said.      The case sets an important precedent, she believes: “I think it’s potentially problematic for companies that have already issued SAFTs or are in the process of doing it. It really prevents many new projects from even starting.”      Crypto networks have unique economics, according to Smith, which make the traditional equity fundraising for them “less desirable than a token pre-sale.”    SAFT in trouble?    Telegram’s battle with the SEC showcases the SAFT framework it used, like many other crypto startups, is not as safe a fundraising method as the industry used to believe.      The framework was introduced in 2017 as a compliant way to sell tokens to institutional investors, unlike the infamous initial coin offerings, which sold largely to retail buyers. The SEC has neither endorsed nor rejected the framework.      Benjamin Beaton, partner at Squire Patton Boggs law firm and one if the authors of the Blockchain Association’s latest brief, believes the industry had good reasons to trust the framework. “The companies were trying hard to comply with the existing rules and applying them to the new product,” he said.      The SEC's enforcement action against Telegram, he added, “seems unfair” and creates more uncertainty, which “highlights the need for clarity in guidance.”      While the court case is not going Telegram's way so far, it may not be the end for SAFTs. “Not all SAFTs are designed exactly the same and just because it doesn’t work for Telegram it doesn’t mean this model won’t work in other areas,"" said Beaton.      Also read: Now More Than Ever, SEC Is Scrutinizing Unregistered Token Offerings      But the overall picture regarding the token agreements and the consequences of this type of fundraising looks to have changed, according to Smith.      “SAFT will survive in some form, but developers and investors are really going to look very hard at the SAFT before deciding to move forward,” she said. “For a while, it was considered the smartest way to do things but now it’s more of a gray area.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/04/09/telegrams-fight-against-sec-will-help-push-cryptocurrency-legislation-says-trade-group,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2cd2e2da22df4790928a2a878933642cbb9d9795-1000x672.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404455,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdiDtz,1586448431,What's Next for Bitcoin After March's Crash – CoinDesk Quarterly Review,"Will bitcoin (BTC) move beyond ""digital gold""? Is ether (ETH) viable as money? In 24 charts, CoinDesk Research shows what happened to crypto assets in Q1 2020 and examines what may emerge in the future. Download our Q1 analysis here, and join us on April 15 for a webinar discussing our findings and other relevant cryptocurrency research.      The CoinDesk Quarterly Review provides research-based insights on how the narrative has changed for blue-chips such as bitcoin and ether. We look at which assets outperformed on returns, and how the participants in crypto markets are shifting in the wake of Q1’s defining event, the March 12 plunge.      Bitcoin’s “digital gold” narrative grew up in a “bull market in everything.” Bitcoin as gold 2.0, a hedge against inflation and a safe haven in an eventual crash, was a meme investors readily understood.      Now, we’ve seen an economic crisis cause dislocation in crypto markets and push bitcoin’s price downward in tandem with stocks. Gold and Treasury bonds appeared to have failed to live up to “safe haven” expectations. If gold’s narrative is being debated, do we still know what “digital gold” means? At the very least, the events of the past month have put to rest the notion that bitcoin today can be a “haven.”    How March 12 shook crypto markets, and how it didn't    The crash shook participants in crypto markets. Open interest in bitcoin futures and perpetual swaps fell off a cliff in March. These markets are used by traders large and small to speculate on bitcoin’s price, and as a temporary hedge against positions in the spot market. Futures volume spiked and settled at a higher baseline, as it did in spot markets. The increased activity is taking place in a shrunken market. About $1.6 billion of traders’ positions were liquidated over two days in March. The sharks are eating each other in a smaller pool, as it were.    At the very least, the events of the past month have put to rest the notion that bitcoin today can be a “haven.”    Bitcoin's long-term holdings, however, remained unmoved. “Hodlwaves” use Bitcoin timestamps known as UTXOs to measure how long each bitcoin has been held. Tracking time between transactions is a useful measure of long-term “buy-and-hold” activity. That activity is consistent with bitcoin’s use case as “digital gold,” a putative store-of-value. Note that long-term holdings (180 days or more) did not change perceptibly during the March 12 crash. Balances held between 90 days and 180 days shifted abruptly. Were bitcoin sellers concentrated among three- to six-month holders? Or were exchange balances, which shifted on these dates, concentrated in that band?    Alternative user narratives: Return of payments?    Some of bitcoin's long-term holders are surely hoping in time it will prove itself as a haven or store of value. But events such as the March crash open the door to new narratives. The flagship crypto asset’s next meme will set the adoption curve for verifiably scarce digital assets. Will payments re-emerge as an avenue to adoption?      Read more: Bitcoin’s Lightning Becomes Latest Protocol to Court Publishers With Micropayments      Since launch, the number of computers running the Lightning Network has increased on average 53 percent every quarter. Lightning is a “layer two” payments system built on top of the Bitcoin network. The value held within Lightning payment channels has also increased.    New importance for bitcoin and ethereum technical road maps    It's possible a new user adoption narrative will be something quite different from what long-term investors in bitcoin have contemplated to date. Will Bitcoin developers add capabilities — like Schnorr signatures, with their privacy and programmability — that lead to its adoption as digital financial infrastructure?      Read more: Bitcoin’s Bull Case Strengthens After Breaching Price Hurdle at $7.1K      The technical road map emerges from Q1 2020 with increased importance for ethereum, as well. Ether evangelists have spread the meme “ETH is money"" in the belief that it has potential as the base currency of a decentralized, digital banking system, dubbed “decentralized finance"" or ""DeFi."" The failure of flagship DeFi systems during the March 12 crash have raised questions about that narrative. Now more than ever it seems to be dependent on a relatively uncertain road map for “ETH 2.0,” an improvement designed to allow more transaction throughput.      On March 12, total ETH locked in DeFi applications increased as expected, then crashed amid a crisis in DeFi’s programmatic governance. If “ETH is money,"" we’d expect to see the amount locked in DeFi and the ETH price grow in tandem, long-term. For the near term, a recovery to previous levels would indicate a restoration of confidence in DeFi systems.

42404445,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdiDk9,1586440800,"Internet Voting Is 'Not Secure' and Blockchain Won't Help, Warns Scientific Body","As the coronavirus pandemic continues to roil elections and voting officials look for solutions, scientific experts are warning against the dangers of voting online.      The American Association for the Advancement of Science’s Center for Scientific Evidence in Public Issues has written an open letter to U.S. governors, secretaries of state and state election directors to express concern about the security of voting via the internet or mobile apps. The AAAS letter has been signed by renowned cybersecurity and computing experts and organizations. It reflects research from the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine, the National Institute of Standards and Technology and other organizations.      “At this time, internet voting is not a secure solution for voting in the United States, nor will it be in the foreseeable future,” the letter reads, pointing to undetected manipulation of votes, privacy violations, malware intrusions, and the potential for denial-of-service attacks and other vulnerabilities.      Internet voting, which includes voting via email, fax, web and mobile app, has no meaningful voter-verified paper record, the letter states, which makes it impossible to conduct a valid audit of the results.    Fundamental issues    The idea of internet voting isn’t new.      Steve M. Newell, project director at AAAS’s Center for Scientific Evidence in Public Issues points to a report facilitated by the National Science Foundation around two decades ago.      “Their conclusion was that it's not a viable product now, and it won't be for the foreseeable future. And then two years ago, the National Academies [of Science, Engineering and Medicine] put out their big comprehensive report on election security and their conclusion was basically the same thing,” he said.      Read more: Election App Voatz Just Got Kicked Out of a Major Bug Bounty Program      New tools, such as blockchain-based voting apps, don’t appear to be a solution either.      According to the letter, the use of blockchain architecture doesn’t address the fundamental issues with internet voting, and if anything creates a larger attack surface. It also raises questions about how the information is stored, decrypted and transferred to a durable paper record.      “There are people who are saying that blockchain voting will deal with the security issues of Internet voting or online voting, and it just doesn't. Blockchains are a data structure, they’re a way of storing data, but they don't deal with it with the main security issues of internet voting,” said Barbara Simons, a fellow with the Association for Computing Machinery and the American Association for the Advancement of Science.      Bringing a blockchain system to an internet voting platform is like “bringing a combination lock to a kitchen fire,” Newell said, quoting an analogy made by MIT cryptographic expert Ron Rivest.      “It's not a tool built to address the problem that you have,” Newell said, adding the evidence indicates that not only is blockchain technology not mitigating the dangers, it’s adding more.      The letter mentions mobile voting app Voatz by name, referencing a Trail of Bits audit confirming vulnerabilities previously reported by MIT researchers “despite the app developer arguing these vulnerabilities did not exist following the MIT report.”      Read more: MIT Wasn’t Only One Auditing Voatz – Homeland Security Did Too, With Fewer Concerns      In particular, the letter pointed to the number of findings highlighted, the possibility of still undiscovered vulnerabilities and “a lack of transparency essential for faith in the electoral system.”      It references the potential for ballot manipulation and for exposing voters’ private information, which could put them at risk of identity theft or, in the case of overseas military voters whose information is compromised, “risks potentially providing adversaries with intelligence regarding military deployments, endangering the lives of service members and national security.”    Alternative solutions    The letter advocated for “thoughtful implementation of alternative voting methods,” such as voting by mail and early voting,      “We must not trade convenience for security, because there are many organizations and people who would like to attack our elections. Our job is to make it as difficult for them as possible, not easy. Moving to internet voting would allow anyone from anywhere to try to attack our elections, and somebody who's very good at this and very well funded might very well succeed. We just can't allow that in a democracy,” Simons said.      Internet voting should not be used until verifiability, security and secrecy can be guaranteed with ballots transmitted online, the letter said. At present, “no known technology” can do so.      Newell said it’s important for people who see the theoretical benefits of internet voting to know it’s not backed by evidence or science and that the insecurity of internet voting is an unambiguous, widely held opinion. For example, he said, groups ranging from the American Civil Liberties Union to the Heritage Foundation are strongly opposed to internet voting.      “I think a lot of people are looking for answers and wondering if internet voting is one of them,” he said. “And I think it makes sense for us to say here, this evidence says it's really not and so, if you want to follow the evidence and heed the science, it's really warning you to avoid internet voting. It's just not a secure solution.""

Canadian investment manager 3iQ said The Bitcoin Fund, for which it originally filed a prospectus back in October, began trading on the TSX on Thursday.      The fund works along the same lines as an exchange-traded product (ETP): investors purchase shares in the fund and receive exposure to changes in the underlying assets price over time. It tracks the bitcoin (BTC) price using an index feed co-developed by MV Index Solutions (MVIS), a VanEck Europe subsidiary, and cryptocurrency market data provider CryptoCompare.      The fund is split into two types of shares, Class A, aimed at all types of investors, and Class F for institutions. Only Class A shars are being listed on the Toronto exchange. 3iQ president and CEO Fred Pye told CoinDesk the total value of Class A shares comes to approximately $14 million.      As with other ETPs, the key attraction is investors who either can't or won't buy the underlying asset can still add bitcoin to their portfolios. Traditional investors can also use the fund as a vehicle to become more familiar with the asset class.      Speaking on Thursday's news, MVIS Managing Director Thomas Kettner said listing on a mainstream exchange would ""help to strengthen the status of digital assets as an asset class.”      See also:‘Short Bitcoin’ ETP Available to Investors on Germany’s Second-Largest Exchange      3iQ said it spent more than three years in dialogue with the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) before receiving approval for The Bitcoin Fund. Connor Loewen, 3iQ's cryptocurrency analyst, said the fund decided to list in Toronto because it is already regulated in Canada.      TSX is the largest and most active stock exchange in Canada. Although other exchanges have also listed cryptocurrency companies, Toronto has made a cottage industry out of it. Bitcoin mining group Hut8 and crypto merchant bank Galaxy Digital are both listed there; so, too, are crypto products such as the Horizon ""blockchain ETF,"" which began trading back in 2018.

42404447,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdiDn6,1586438871,CEO Says BlockFi Is Lending to Crypto Miners as Other Providers Pull Back,"The CEO of BlockFi said the crypto lending platform is extending credit to miners at a time when competition for their business has eased because of the coronavirus crisis.      “We’re starting to establish relationships with miners for the first time now,” Zac Prince said. The reason: The market has lost some of its risk appetite, he said.      Previously, BlockFi couldn't win miners' business began the company’s competitors were willing to take bigger risks than BlockFi was comfortable with, Prince said. “Two months ago, lots of lenders were accepting miner equipment as collateral, and this isn’t happening anymore. Now, the risk tolerance on the market [has] declined.”      Like other lenders in this market, BlockFi makes fiat loans collateralized by cryptocurrencies, and vice versa.      Two other crypto lenders, Celsius and Nexo, said they did not accept specialized mining computers, known as ASICs, as collateral, but they are still lending to miners. A third, Genesis Capital, did not respond to a request for comment by press time, but CEO Michael Moro said on a recent podcast it had paused extending credit.      Read more: Bitcoin Miner Maker Canaan Lost $148M in 2019      Taking mining machines as collateral is very risky indeed, said Nexo’s managing partner Antoni Trenchev. “It is rapidly diminishing in value and has to be stored somewhere, so I don't think it makes a whole lot of sense.”      Overall, despite the ebbs and flows of the crypto market, BlockFi’s business has been doing well this spring, Prince said. According to him, BlockFi saw its monthly revenue “more than double” since February, although he wouldn’t disclose the numbers.     More big borrowers    The set of institutional clients is growing as well, Prince said: Compared to some 60 institutions borrowing crypto from BlockFi in Q4 of 2019, about 90 are doing so now. Most of these lenders are market makers and proprietary trading firms.      One such client, Hong Kong-based fund Three Arrow Capital, joined the list of BlockFi’s investors recently, buying the shares from another investor, Able Partners.      In February, BlockFi closed a $30 million funding round lead by Peter Thiel’s Valar Ventures. One of the participants was Able Partners, which supported BlockFi as a company with a female co-founder (Flori Marquez).      Now Able Partners has decided to “recycle capital to support other early-stage founders, which is needed more than ever during these turbulent times,"" the fund’s partner Amanda Eilian said through a spokesperson.      In March, BlockFi added an option to deposit fiat on the platform, partnering with the crypto-friendly Silvergate Bank. When the client sends dollars to BlockFi, they get converted into stablecoins and stored this way on the platform, so that users can buy other cryptos with these stablecoins, Prince said.

The companies announced the move Thursday, saying it makes ErisX’s spot market available to FDA’s customers. ErisX is the first exchange FDA has onboarded.      Terrence Dempsey, FDA’s head of product, told CoinDesk that ErisX’s regulatory compliance, counterparty risk analysis and existing tools made the platform attractive for his company’s customers.      “We have an execution platform that is connected to our custody offering that offers two things,” he said. “One [is] a matching engine, so we'll look to cross client trades and if we can't ... we go out to a network of venues, or liquidity providers as we call them, that we can actually go and execute with.”      ErisX CEO Thomas Chippas told CoinDesk the signing is “a great validation of what we’ve been working on for so long, which is to get these sorts of household institutional intermediary names into our market.”      One of the company’s goals is to continue bringing traditional intermediaries into the crypto space, though he noted Fidelity Digital Assets in particular had been building out its crypto efforts, which include custody and execution services, for some time.      Thursday’s news marks an expansion of a longstanding relationship between Fidelity and ErisX: Fidelity was one of the exchange’s investors back in December 2018.      “A big investment from a household name in financial services ... is in and of itself a big deal, but the fact that they're now reaching out and connecting out to a market like ours I think validates the central limit order book concept,” Chippas said.    Benefits of the deal    The advantage of a central limit order book is that all parties – meaning clearinghouse participants – have access to the same liquidity pool, Chippas said.      “They all get access to the same opportunity to to get the best possible price and I think that's what's attractive,” he said.      OTC desks might massage a price up when connecting a buyer and a seller to maximize their own profit, but this is not possible on ErisX’s system, he said.      Historically FDA has been working with a network of Over-The-Counter (OTC) desks, Dempsey said, but it’s “really helpful” to identify the liquidity pool to which the asset manager’s crypto custodian has access.      “It differentiates the type of liquidity that we'd be able to offer back to a client so there's no change from a client perspective, other than we think having transparent markets that we could trade through via ErisX could increase better liquidity for the clients,” Dempsey said.      To be clear, ErisX is only providing access to its order book and spot exchange. The actual user interface and experience are still offered by FDA.      The move potentially comes at a good time for investors. Dempsey said FDA has seen “an uptick in everything across our business” over the past several weeks.      “[We] continue to have discussions with institutions that aren't necessarily invested in the market today, but are seeing more and more interest in doing so and that could be tied to some of the things that are going on the more macro stage,” Dempsey said.    Broader universe    ErisX intends to continue growing its clearinghouse membership, according to Chippas. He declined to say how many members there are currently, though he noted that ErisX has both retail and institutional clients. He named TD Ameritrade and TradeStation as two of these institutions.      Nor does Thursday’s move reflect any concerns on ErisX’s equally long-standing relationship with TD Ameritrade, he said.      “TD Ameritrade as you know is being acquired by Charles Schwab and when you get involved in big M&A that tends to consume 100 percent of management attention and just slow things down,” Chippas said. He expects to continue working with the broker in future.      Chippas also expects institutions – seen on again and off again as the potential savior to the crypto markets – to slowly onboard crypto.      “I think ... expectations are that everything happens instantaneously ... [but] there’s going to be all sorts of development and some of these things take time,” he said.      The fact that Fidelity’s customer trades will now occur on a regulated and surveilled order book should build confidence for other entities, he said.      “It’s significant for their customers and for the market ... it’s just happening at institutional traditional speed, which is not native crypto speed and it’s okay. We need people to operate under different time frames,” he said.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/09/fidelity-taps-erisx-exchange-to-boost-crypto-trading-liquidity,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9628561e091cc5cb9e6a5ba93b160dd2ebb4f20c-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431689,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN5Wzh,1586437200,This Visa Card Gives Bitcoin Rewards on Dollars Spent,"The startup behind the bitcoin-friendly shopping app Fold just joined the Visa Fast Track Program to issue a card that offers bitcoin rewards instead of traditional reward points.      Fold founder Will Reeves said an email poll of roughly 30,000 Fold users revealed 90 percent said they would “switch spending away from their existing card” for a card with bitcoin (BTC) rewards for dollars spent. The waiting list is now open for the Fold card that starts shipping in July.      “You manage everything within [the Fold app], your card details, your rewards,” Reeves said in an interview. “We’re able to send out to your [bitcoin] wallet of choice. … You don’t have to wait to accrue too much of it [bitcoin].”      There are already several companies offering Visa cards so bitcoiners can spend cryptocurrency as dollars, including Coinbase, and options for shopping on desktop with most cards for bitcoin rewards, with the browser-plugin Lolli.      Read more: Coinbase Becomes First ‘Pure’ Crypto Firm Approved as Visa Principal Member      Both Lolli and Fold App have seen a dramatic increase in online shopping for essentials and home equipment since the coronavirus crisis hit the United States. Fold users are buying more gift cards for Amazon and Target, while Lolli shoppers are spending more at Sam’s Club, Vitacost, Best Buy and Newegg, according to Lolli’s head of communications, Aubrey Strobel.      “We’ve seen an uptick in volume the entire month,” Reeves said of the 24,000 transactions by Fold users in Q1 2020. That represents a 110 percent increase over Q4 2019, with “thousands of new users.” Across the board, companies that help retail users accrue bitcoin have generally performed well during the broader market turndown.      The goal of this new card is to “meet consumers where they’re at,” Reeves said, “giving users the ability to accrue and use bitcoin in their daily lives.”    Earning, not spending    Fold investor Meltem Demirors once owned one of the first bitcoin-affiliated cards, a Shift debit card for spending bitcoin. She said Fold’s new product is unique because the card enables people to earn rather than spend bitcoin.      “The capital gains [taxes] for [spending] are just such a pain,” Demirors said. “I’ve been spending [dollars] nonstop with Fold.”      Read more: How to Earn and Spend Bitcoin on Black Friday 2019      Users can already shop directly through the app and earn rewards for using the Lightning Network option, for example, while they wait for the Visa program to roll out later this year. Users can choose to spend bitcoin with this feature, but most seem to prefer spending dollars for bitcoin rewards. The average transaction size in Q1 2020 was $55, according to Reeves.      Fold certainly won’t be the last team to explore bitcoin-related credit cards. When asked if the exchange Kraken was exploring a Visa card program like Coinbase or Fold, Kraken bitcoin strategist Pierre Rochard answered, “We’re always looking to better serve our customers.”      NFL player and Fold investor Russell Okung said in a press release the Fold Visa card now “represents a significant step towards mainstream adoption of Bitcoin.” In the press release, Visa Global Head of Fintech Terry Angelos said Fold joined a program that offers “unprecedented access to Visa experts, technology, and resources.”      Update (April 9, 15:21 UTC): The new offering from Fold isn’t a credit card.

42431678,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN5Wfh,1586434708,Bitcoin Miner Maker Canaan Lost $148M in 2019,"Chinese bitcoin miner manufacturer Canaan Creative disclosed a net loss of $148.6 million for 2019 on revenue of $204.3 million, reflecting declining profitability over the past three years.      On Thursday, the firm released its first unaudited earnings report since going public in the U.S. in November. Canaan said it sold computing power totaling 10.5 exhashes per second (EH/s), which accounted for roughly 20 percent of the Bitcoin network’s computing power growth last year.      Since its $90 million IPO, Canaan’s share price has been on a downward trend and is currently around $3.5 per share – 61 percent below its offering price.      The firm said it recorded $114.7 million in net loss in Q4 2019 alone, which widened its $31.2 million net loss for the first nine months in 2019.      Nangeng Zhang, CEO and founder of Canaan, said in an earnings call on Thursday morning Eastern time that, although the firm recorded sales uptick in October and November, it saw a ""considerable drop"" in volume in December amid volatility in bitcoin's price.      “As a result of the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, a widespread health crisis that adversely affected general commercial activities, the economies, financial markets, as well as the cryptocurrency market activities, we have lowered our expectations for business in the year of 2020,"" according to the report. ""For the first quarter of 2020, the Company expects total revenues not less than RMB60 million [$8.5 million].”      Also notable in the report is the increasing ratio of the “cost of revenues” for Canaan’s sales of bitcoin miners over the past year, which leads to declining profitability. In 2019, the cost of revenue for Canaan was $278 million, $78 million more than the total revenue made for the year, largely due to inventories and prepayments write down of $104.7 million in Q4.      Canaan’s cost of revenues generally include the costs of raw material, production and logistics for the manufacturing of mining equipment, as well as write-downs of prepayments and inventories.    Selling at loss?    To put this into perspective, in 2017, Canaan’s total cost of revenues was $100 million with no inventory write-down, accounting for 54 percent of its $183 million revenue on the back of the crypto market bull run at the time. It brought home $53 million with a 30 percent net profit margin.      In 2018, its total cost of revenues went up to $307.4 million, taking up 80 percent of its $378 million revenue. But the total cost included a write-down of $110 million in inventories because the market downturn made it hard for Canaan to sell those machines.      The increase in the cost of revenues is perhaps also due to the fact that more advanced mining equipment relies on more costly chip technology.      According to Canaan’s IPO prospectus, the cost of its Avalon 10, the latest range of miner launched to help weather bitcoin’s halving event, is around $751, compared to $354 and $600 for its older Avalon 8 and 9 series. Prices had been around $1,200 in December for the Avalon 10.      Based on information advertised by Canaan’s authorized distributors, several Avalon 10 models are currently on sale, as a buying spree from investors has cooled down in recent months.      The firm has also recently been hit with a lawsuit filed by an investor who bought its shares and then accused the company of making misleading statements about its operations and financial data, and of violating the U.S. securities laws.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Wolfie Zhao,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/04/09/bitcoin-miner-maker-canaan-lost-148m-in-2019,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fb6c61e885d15b27f4e62a315608aaecb40fc5b3-1200x726.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Galaxy Digital reported a net loss of $32.9 million in Q4 2019 on Wednesday. The merchant bank's trading arm incurred the vast majority of losses, more than $32.1 million, which wiped out the bank's other revenue streams and meant the company was unable to offset its operating expenses. Adding unrealized gains and losses, this figure dropped slightly to $32.7 million.      Novogratz, a former hedge fund manager and Goldman Sachs partner, founded Galaxy Digital in January 2018 to invest in the digital asset space. As well as cryptocurrencies, his merchant bank invests in companies working in the industry. Per the recent filings, it holds equity in banking service provider Silvergate, derivatives exchange Bakkt, as well as the crypto venture fund Pantera.      However, Galaxy has consistently struggled to make much in the way of profit. Many of its quarterly results come out in the red. It made a $68 million loss in the third quarter of 2019, too. In 2018, the firm's first full year of operation, it reported a total loss of $272.7 million.      See also: Bitcoin Drove Half of Square’s Cash App Revenue in the 4th Quarter      Back in February, Galaxy laid off 15 percent of its staff. According to one former employee, the company was forced to cut back because the digital asset space was growing more slowly than anticipated.      While the second half of 2019 was disappointing for the company, it still reported a comprehensive net income of $25.8 million. As it says in its recent filing, hype around libra earlier in the year led to a resurgence of interest in the digital asset space. Filings from the time show the bank made $113.8 million in Q2 2019, largely as a result of its trading arm.      However, Galaxy doesn't expect the good times to return just yet. Although the first half of Q1 2020 had looked promising, the company said it will experience knock-on effects from the coronavirus, which has now brought society to a standstill and increased economic uncertainty.      ""[Bitcoin] still remains subject to global risk appetites as positioning decisions are considered in conjunction with investors' broader portfolio,"" reads Galaxy's securities filing.

German bank BayernLB predicted last year that bitcoin's halving could drive its price to $90,000, roughly 12 times the current level.      Cryptocurrency markets got a sneak preview on Wednesday as a lesser coin, bitcoin cash (BCH), went through its own halving. Spoiler alert: There wasn't much to see.      You're reading First Mover, CoinDesk's daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      ""All in all, this has been very anticlimactic,"" Denis Vinokourov, head of research at Bequant, a cryptocurrency exchange and institutional brokerage, wrote in an email.      Bitcoin cash prices rose 5.9 percent Wednesday, entirely in line with its trading range on most days. Cryptocurrencies have been volatile since long before the coronavirus hit. Bitcoin climbed 2.3 percent on the day.      ""In crypto, that's normal,"" Roger Ver, executive chairman of Bitcoin.com and a key proponent of bitcoin cash, said in an audio interview over Telegram from his home in St. Kitts.      Ver says he hadn't been expecting much from the event. He's been around the crypto industry since the early days, and witnessed bitcoin's halvings in 2012 and 2016. This week's halving was the first for bitcoin cash, which split off from bitcoin in 2017.      ""A leap year happens every four years,"" Ver said. ""Life goes on. Nobody cares. After you've been through one leap year, it's not interesting or exciting anymore.""      The episode offers a dose of reality for crypto-industry newcomers who might be looking forward to something spectacular when bitcoin's next halving arrives in May. It's so hotly anticipated that clever web designers have erected pages featuring countdown clocks. As of the latest look, it'll take place in an estimated 34 days, seven hours and 47 minutes. (On May 13, around 09:25 UTC.)      If bitcoin cash's halving is any guide, there really won't be much to see. Maybe champagne glasses will clink somewhere, celebrating the passage of another four years of bitcoin's remarkable existence since it was created in early 2009 atop what is now the world's largest blockchain network.      See CoinDesk Research's report on the bitcoin halving      Bitcoin's price, currently around $7,300, has climbed 20-fold since the start of 2015, the first full year of historical data from the popular cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase. There were a lot of days between then and now, many of them up, many of them down, and only one of those days in 2016 coincided with a halving.  Blockchains like the ones powering bitcoin and bitcoin cash rely on high-speed computer operators and data centers known as ""miners,"" which collectively process quintillions of computations per second in an effort to maintain and protect the security and integrity of the network. To keep the miners affixed over the long term, according to Ver, ""the price only has to double once every four years.""  ""I've always said that the price is the least interesting thing about cryptocurrencies,"" Ver said. ""The price is just a side effect of the amount of adoption you're getting in the world.""  Four years is quite a span – enough to frustrate investors, analysts and researchers who might prefer to clearly quantify the price impact of past halvings, or of the upcoming halving.  Just think back to how much has happened in cryptocurrency markets in the past six months: Chinese President Xi Jinping said the world's largest economy would ""seize the opportunities"" afforded by blockchain technology. (Bitcoin jumped 12 percent.) The U.S. killed a top Iranian general, threatening to escalate into a war. (Up 10 percent.) The coronavirus came along. (Bitcoin plunged, then recovered, and is now up 2 percent year-to-date.)      ""The market's always pricing in everything,"" Ver said.      With many investors seeing bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation – a digital and more portable form of gold, as it were – the unprecedented trillions of dollars of coronavirus-related aid and stimulus might ultimately make the halving an afterthought. Unlike the coronavirus, after all, the halving was telegraphed years in advance.  Blockware Solutions, which brokers high-speed computers used for cryptocurrency mining, wrote Wednesday in an e-mail that price is ""not just supply side economics,"" but demand.  ""Bitcoin has the most robust ecosystem in the blockchain industry, and the fundamentals continuously improve due to the global macro improving sentiment and accelerating demand,"" according to the note. The point was that bitcoin watchers shouldn't draw too many conclusions from bitcoin cash's halving.  Rich Rosenblum, a former managing director of Wall Street firm Goldman Sachs who now oversees markets at the digital-asset trading firm GSR, noted bitcoin cash prices usually trade in sync with bitcoin's – similar to the way gold and silver prices track, as do oil and gasoline.  ""The bitcoin halving in a month is going to have more impact on bitcoin cash than the bitcoin cash halving,"" he said in a phone interview.  Bitcoin cash's halving took place at 12:19 UTC, when the blockchain network reached block number 630,000. The most immediate impact was also, perhaps, the most visible: The next data block took nearly two hours to close, well beyond the average of about 10 minutes.      According to Ver, that probably happened because miners reallocated their computational power toward suddenly more profitable blockchains like Bitcoin and Bitcoin SV.      The Bitcoin Cash protocol has a feature that automatically adjusts the difficulty of mining a new data block when there's a sudden scarcity of miners; the mechanism is designed to lure some back. Block 630,001 took just 16 minutes to close, the data show.      Just like adding an extra day to the calendar every four years, these halvings have to happen to make everything work right.      So when bitcoin's halving comes, will it be time to pop the champagne? Why not. Will it be entertaining? Better have YouTube queued up, just in case.    Tweet of the day    Bitcoin watch        BTC: Price: $7,327 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $7,399 | 24-Hr Low: $7,210      Trend: Bitcoin has found acceptance above the three-day 200-candle average and looks set to extend the ongoing rally toward $8,000. That would bring prices back to a level seen ahead of the massive sell-off on March 12.      The cryptocurrency is changing hands near $7,312 at press time, while the long-term average is now located at $7,093. As seen on the three-day chart, the bulls repeatedly failed to keep gains above the crucial average in the three weeks to April 5, before flipping the hurdle into support during in the last few days.      The breakout may prompt more buyers to join the market, leading to stronger price gains. Supporting the bullish case is the three-day chart MACD histogram’s crossover above zero, a confirmation of bearish-to-bullish trend change.      The bullish case would be neutralized if the spot price drops below $7,050, violating the ascending trendline connecting the March 13 and March 30 lows.

42431696,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN5XBh,1586431530,Bitcoin’s Bull Case Strengthens After Breaching Price Hurdle at $7.1K,"View  Bitcoin's break above a long-term moving average resistance near $7,100 has strengthened the case for a rally to $8,000.  A drop in trading volumes is a cause for concern for the bulls, however.  The outlook will remain bullish as long as prices are holding above support near $6,800.    After multiple failed attempts, bitcoin (BTC) has finally broken above key resistance, bringing a boost to the short-term bullish case.      The top cryptocurrency by market value closed (UTC) well above $7,100 on Wednesday, marking an upside break of the 200-period moving average on the three-day chart.      The breakout could now invite stronger chart-driven buying, as a move above the long-term technical line is often considered a confirmation of a bearish-to-bullish trend change.      The 200-period average had repeatedly capped upside in the final days of March. Now that the hurdle has been convincingly crossed, buyers who entered the market earlier this month may also be more comfortable in holding their positions. All in all, the move is a good signal for prices.      The risk-on action seen in traditional markets is also supportive of further gains for bitcoin. Major European indices like Germany’s DAX and the U.K.'s FTSE are currently reporting slight gains. Asian stocks also rose early on Thursday following an overnight surge on Wall Street.      Read more: Crypto Trading Volumes Rise in India After Banking Crisis, COVID-19 Lockdown      The sentiment seems to have been buoyed by reports that the U.S. and European nations are discussing plans to reopen their respective economies at the start of May. Most countries imposed lockdowns of varying degrees of severity in March in order to contain the coronavirus outbreak, negatively impacting commerce.      At press time, bitcoin is changing hands near $7,340, representing a 0.80 percent increase on a 24-hour basis., according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index. That's well above the 200-period average at $7,093.      The cryptocurrency has recovered by more than $3,400 from the low of $3,867 reached during the early Asian trading hours on March 13 and is now just $700 short of levels near $8,000 seen ahead of the price crash seen March 12.    Three-day chart    Bitcoin repeatedly failed to cross the 200-period average hurdle in the three weeks to April 5, weakening the immediate bullish case and raising the odds of a price pullback.      However, the breakout confirmed by the previous green candle, representing price action for April 6-9, indicates that the rally from lows below $4,000 has resumed.      The MACD histogram, an indicator used to identify trend strength and trend changes, has crossed above zero, signaling a bearish-to-bullish trend change. Further, the Chaikin money flow index is hovering above zero – a sign buying pressure is outweighing selling pressure.      All in all, there is a strong case to believe bitcoin will test psychological resistance at $8,000 in the short-term.    Daily chart    Bitcoin is trapped in an ascending price channel, as seen above.      Monday’s green marubozu candle, which marked a breakout above $7,000, points to bullish market sentiment. The five- and 10-day averages are trending north, indicating strong upward momentum.      The only cause for concern for the bulls is a decline in trading volumes. A low-volume rally often ends with a notable price drop.      That said, the bias will turn bearish only if prices drop below $6,773 (horizontal line). That would invalidate the marubozu candle created on April 6 and open the doors for a pullback to $5,856 (March 30 low).",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/09/bitcoins-bull-case-strengthens-after-breaching-price-hurdle-at-71k,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/306023db4539f332e4efe9ea1b0bcdae48a88abd-1500x931.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431691,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN5X7h,1586422800,Researchers Are Tapping Blockchain Tools in Fight Against Coronavirus,"A series of ongoing efforts across universities, medical academia, the private sector and even private citizens are harnessing distributed systems in the fight against COVID-19.      The projects are attempting to buttress governmental stay-at-home orders that have frozen billions of people in a global effort to flatten the curve. There's no known cure for COVID-19 and there will be no vaccine against the coronavirus that causes it for at least a year, leaving medical practitioners, researchers and innovators to try and find ways of mitigating its impact – and blockchain boosters are finding new fronts to pitch in.      One such avenue is in contact tracing. Hasshi Sudler, an adjunct professor with Villanova University's Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, is leading development of a permissioned blockchain for doctors to trace positive COVID-19 cases, possibly getting ahead of future outbreaks.      “Medical institutions, whether they know each other or not, whether they trust each other or not, can exchange information about who they know that is infected and maintain contact with who is infected,” over the blockchain, Sudler told CoinDesk.      The need is clear: A number of countries instituted lockdowns to prevent the virus’s spread, leading to massive unemployment numbers and a likely recession.      The Villanova project is still in its early stages, but around the world other initiatives are racing ahead, or already deployed.      In Berlin, startup Spherity has developed a decentralized identity system to help patients keep their social distance while getting medication. Honduran authorities have deployed a blockchain-backed app to track and manage stay-at-home orders.      Six thousand ethereum miners are now contributing to Stanford University’s Folding@home distributed computing project, which pools GPU power to search for a COVID-19 cure.      Academia, too, has begun prodding for novel blockchain pandemic applications. An April 5 submission to the journal Diagnostics proposed a combined blockchain and AI system for self testing.    Long way to go    The cross-industry efforts remain a small part of the fight against the pandemic.      The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) – a critical institution in the U.S. fight against COVID-19 – highlighted the potential for digital technologies to help combat pandemics in a Monday blog post.      CDC’s post cited two March 27 articles in the journal Nature Medicine that discussed technology in the context of COVID-19. The first commentary mashed up “four inter-related technologies” – internet-of-things, artificial intelligence, big-data analytics and blockchain – and dove into each tech’s surveillance and mitigation capacity. The second weighed responsible technology use against public health imperatives.      Authors of the CDC post implicitly endorsed many of the first article’s stated digital technologies by giving examples for each one’s use. AI could help detect COVID-19 cases or develop vaccines; big data could help model viral outbreaks; IoT could be a powerful avenue for public health data collection, but, as the second article noted, would force thorny questions about privacy and ethics.      “Control of pandemics can require unusual steps that must be measured and limited to the scope of the outbreak to prevent overreach,” CDC authors wrote.      Blockchain’s likely impact was detailed in the first cited Nature Medicine commentary. There, authors predicted that blockchain would have a low likely impact in vaccine manufacture and insurance processes, and a moderate likely impact in the distribution of medication, which researchers said was already happening in Chinese hospitals.      “Through the use of blockchain, hospitals could ensure timely delivery of medications with accurate tracking,” the Nature Medicine authors wrote.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/09/researchers-are-tapping-blockchain-tools-in-fight-against-coronavirus,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/af21a3e653c2804c4c812a61cf35a7e82b944132-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431687,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN5Wvh,1586419200,"Crypto Trading Volumes Rise in India After Banking Crisis, COVID-19 Lockdown","MUMBAI — India, the world’s second-most populous country, is increasingly embracing cryptocurrencies amid domestic economic issues and the nationwide coronavirus-related lockdown.      It started on March 4 when the country's highest court quashed a Reserve Bank of India (RBI) order dated April 6, 2018, which prohibited banks from providing services to entities dealing with cryptocurrencies. Activity on exchanges immediately picked up.      “There has been a considerable increase in trading volumes on exchanges catering to Indian clients due to the clarity offered by the Supreme Court’s ruling,” said Ashish Singhal, founder and CEO of cryptocurrency exchange CoinSwitch.      Crypto banking services platform Cashaa India noted a spike of 800 percent in trading volumes in the 48 hours following the decision. “The platform also registered a volume of 600+ BTC in the first 24 hours,” said Cashaa CEO Kumar Gaurav.      Back then, Indian traders were in a rush, in large part due to rumors the government would intervene by declaring cryptocurrencies illegal. “Every trader was looking to take advantage of the time window offered by the Supreme Court’s ruling,” Gaurav said. That likely fueled the initial spike in volumes.      Momentum has remained strong ever since amid host of domestic and international calamities.    Financial panic    The activity on exchanges further improved after Yes Bank, India’s fourth-largest lender, collapsed on March 6, damaging confidence in the country’s banking system.      The nationwide panic triggered by the Yes Bank crisis worked in favor of bitcoin, boosting Cashaa’s sales at a daily rate of 250 percent to 450 percent, according to data provided by the platform.      Traditional markets like equities and bonds panicked in March as the coronavirus outbreak gathered pace across Europe and in the United States. India’s benchmark equity index NIFTY 50 dropped by 23 percent in March, while the Indian rupee hit a record low of 77.40 per U.S. dollar.      Read more: VC Tim Draper Eyes India Investments as Nation Enters Crypto ‘Renaissance’      Further, India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a three-week-long nationwide lockdown on March 24 to contain the coronavirus outbreak.      However, the sell-off in traditional markets and the curfew haven’t stopped Indians from venturing into cryptocurrencies. “March was one of the best months, doubling the volume from last month,” CoinSwitch's Singhal said.      The Mumbai-based cryptocurrency exchange WazirX has also registered growth amid the coronavirus crisis. “Signups have increased by 25 percent during the lockdown,” said Nischal Shetty, founder and CEO of WazirX.    Open 24-7    Investor interest in bitcoin is likely sustained by round-the-clock trading, in contrast to Indian equity markets, which operate from 9 a.m. to 3.30 p.m. Monday to Friday. Further, it is a decentralized, peer-to-peer, and borderless payment mechanism designed for situations like the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.      One theory is the longer people can’t go outside to conduct their business, the more useful BTC should become because ""it can be sent and received from the safety of one’s home,” Justin Gillespie, CEO of Titus Investment Advisors and bitcoin trader, told CoinDesk.      If the volume growth seen over the past month is anything to go by, investors' interest certainly looks to have picked up.      “Within a span of 30 days, daily trading volume on WazirX has increased by 60 percent and the exchange has received a total amount of 100 crore rupees ($13 million),” WazirX CEO Nischal Shetty said.      Meanwhile, cryptocurrency exchange CoinDCX has witnessed a 78.36 percent increase in trading volumes in BTC/INR pairs. “We also had a trading competition that saw 800 BTC volume in BTC/INR markets,” said CoinDCX’s chief executive Sumit Gupta.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/04/09/crypto-trading-volumes-rise-in-india-after-banking-crisis-covid-19-lockdown,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4a42bcff5d72907e9fccdb1555993a8c47c60776-1200x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431682,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN5Wph,1586412000,CoinShares Hires WisdomTree Exec as Company Plans Expansion Outside UK,"CoinShares has hired a former WisdomTree exec to raise international sales as U.K. regulators – the asset manager's home turf – are set to crack down on crypto financial products.      The Jersey-based digital asset manager announced Wednesday it hired Frank Spiteri (pictured), former head of European distribution at WisdomTree – a U.S. financial product provider and $70 billion asset manager – as its new chief revenue officer (CRO).      Per the release, Spiteri's new responsibilities will involve leading CoinShares' marketing and sales efforts as well as overseeing the company's primary exchange-traded product (ETP) business. CoinShares Chairman Danny Masters said the firm also plans to use Spiteri's experience and European links to support its efforts to expand to the European continent.      ""[Spiteri's] tenure and deep relationships with European institutions will facilitate a substantial expansion of our ETP business. Under Frank’s leadership and guidance, we plan to accelerate the growth of our asset management arm, and enhance our status as a leader in the digital asset industry,"" Masters said in a statement.      When with WisdomTree, Spiteri was responsible for the whole European distribution team, including sales management and marketing in the region, according to his LinkedIn profile.      See also: Financial Services: The Coming Cataclysm      The news comes as the outlook in the U.K. continues to darken for firms working with crypto derivatives. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) – the U.K's chief financial watchdog – proposed a full retail ban on all such products last summer, saying they represent too much of a risk for the vast majority of retail investors. A final decision is expected later this year.      CoinShares owns XBT Provider, one of Europe's largest crypto derivative product providers, and has opposed the proposal at every turn. It even led a campaign at the end of last year to encourage industry players to provide feedback to the FCA during the proposal's consultation period.      Masters told CoinDesk earlier this year that ""banning such instruments has many adverse consequences"" and ""will not protect investors."" In fact, they will likely have the opposite effect, pushing investors to offshore trading platforms that have little to no investor protection, he said.      The FCA's proposal will not affect institutional access, but CoinShares has mooted the possibility of moving more of its operations outside its jurisdiction. Masters once said the company could do its initial public offering (IPO) elsewhere, such as in the U.S. or Sweden, if the U.K. ban ever came into effect.      See also:Investors Can Hedge Long-Term Risk With New 2-Year Bitcoin Derivatives      Although Spiteri's role covers various responsibilities, his European connections may be key if CoinShares is looking at opportunities outside the U.K., maybe even in places where ""mom and pop"" investors will still be able to pick up a crypto ETP.
