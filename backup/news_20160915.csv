42378821,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7m7Qd,1473968261,Vitalik Buterin to Debut Ethereum Scaling Paper at Devcon,"Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin will present a new version of the project's 'mauve paper' at a developer conference in Shanghai next week.  Scheduled for 19th September, a talk called ""Mauve Revolution"" will focus on scaling features still in development on the decentralized application platform, including sharding and proof-of-stake.  The third version of the paper, it is likely to keep a similar spirit as past editions, which have seen Buterin use a tongue-in-cheek tone to discuss the big-picture developments the project is seeking to enact as it approaches key development milestones.  In interview, Buterin said that the talk will discuss the planned transition of ethereum's current code to a new, upgraded version of the platform dubbed ""ethereum 2.0"", a transition he estimates is about one-third complete.  Buterin said it is this ""second stage"" that the paper will discuss, telling CoinDesk:  ""The ethereum roadmap now has what I would consider three main stages. The first stage is already finished, the second is [about] getting PoS out the door and adding in economic finality and basic sharding.""  However, Buterin indicated that ethereum very much remains a work in progress, and that he sees this stage of its development lasting until 2020 or later. Should the network reach version 3.0, he said he’s still considering how it would move forward.  ""I think the third stage will be much more challenging,"" he said, adding:  ""[It] will require heavy involvement from people who have been thinking about problems like p2p network design, distributed hash tables, distributed systems concurrency for decades and are smarter than myself.""

42378819,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7m7Mr,1473963438,Australia to Lead International Blockchain Standards Effort,"An Australian group has been selected by the International Organization of Standardization (ISO) to spearhead a technical committee developing standards for blockchain tech.  Standards Australia announced its leadership role on the committee yesterday, revealing it will oversee members from 35 countries on the effort. The ISO, founded in the 1940s, is composed of representatives from more than 160 national standards-setting bodies.  As such, in addition to Australia, the ISO work will draw representatives from standards bodies in Canada, France, the UK and the US, among others.  The announcement sends yet another strong signal that the drive to establish standards for blockchain tech is now accelerating in the finance and technology sectors and beyond.  Bronwyn Evans, CEO of Standards Australia, said in a statement:  ""Leading the ISO blockchain committee will place Australia in the perfect position to help inform, shape and influence the future direction of international standards to support the rollout and deployment of blockchain technology. This exciting initiative will put Australia at the centre stage of global innovation and digital disruption.""  The Australian government lauded the move, a stance that echoes its past support for the technology's exploration both domestically and abroad.  ""The benefits of this technology could be profound, extending right across our economy,"" Australian Treasurer Scott Morrison said in a statement. ""Standards Australia is positioning Australia as a leading global player in this exciting new area.""  To observers, the decision perhaps isn't surprising as Australia has arguably emerged as a potential hotbed for the technology.  The Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), for instance, is moving to potentially replace its market infrastructure with a blockchain system. ASX recently unveiled a prototype version of this technology, and this week, yet another Australian exchange vowed to use the same technology to undercut its market position.  The country's state-owned postal service has also been testing potential applications of blockchain for voting and digital identity.

42378817,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7m7KL,1473959096,Blockchain Veterans Unveil Secure Smart Contracts Framework,"Amid new concerns about the viability of blockchain smart contracts, one company is releasing a proposal that seeks to make it easier to ensure their security.  Developed by Smart Contract Solutions, the open-source Zeppelin project aims to offer a community-driven framework for secure, audited code. The goal is to prevent the unintentional loss of funds, a danger perhaps best illustrated by the collapse of ethereum's biggest smart contract, The DAO.  Since ethereum is the best-known smart contract platform, the first set of tools are written in its programming language Solidity. But, Zeppelin is also currently compatible with Rootstock (which could one day take the same smart contract functionality to bitcoin) and some private blockchains.  The vision is to build a blockchain-agnostic security platform.  Zeppelin developer Demian Brener told CoinDesk:  ""Zeppelin aims to close this gap by making it easy for developers to build secure smart contracts to power the development of distributed apps, protocols and organizations.""  The platform was developed by Brener and Manuel Aráoz, both of whom are no stranger to blockchain development.  The two developers previously teamed up to create the video platform Streamium, and Aráoz is widely credited with creating proof of existence, among the first projects to envision how a public blockchain could be used to verify data.  Popularized by ethereum, smart contracts are the self-executing code that aim to automate tasks and agreements, with the long-term goal being to reduce manual operations.  Brener said that Zeppelin is particularly interested in using smart contracts to make it easier to start businesses. Someday, the team envisions creating an autonomous organization that automatically awards users based on the number of contributions they make to an open-source project.  More information can be found on the official Zeppelin website, launching today.

42378828,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7m7ZR,1473952509,New Blockchain 'Alliance' Forms in Shanghai,"A new group is focusing on promoting blockchain tech in Shanghai.  Calling itself the Shanghai Blockchain Industry Development Research Alliance, the group is seeking to turn the city into a regional hub for the technology. According to a press release announcing the organization, members include the Shanghai Municipal Development and Reform Research Institute, Wanxiang Blockchain Lab and Hyperledger member BitSE.  The group's origins date back to earlier this summer when discussions between the Shanghai government and members of the local blockchain sector began.  BitSE CEO DJ Qian told CoinDesk:  ""The Shanghai government wanted to take notice and support these type of innovative blockchain applications.""  The group mirrors a similar effort being undertaken in Shenzhen.  In June, 31 companies formed a consortium aimed at information-sharing and the exploration of the technology. Notable sponsors of that effort include Ping An Bank and a subsidiary of Tencent, the maker of the popular QQ messaging app.  China, which has a deep connection with bitcoin through both the mining and exchange trade ecosystems, has seen growing interest among established firms in blockchain applications beyond digital cash. Shanghai itself is also set to play host to a series of blockchain-related conferences next week.  Reportedly sponsoring the new organization is the China Finance Information Center, an office complex that plays home to the state-run Xinhua News Agency and other financial services company. The group's organizers said that the Information Center will play a significant role in both promoting the effort and creating a meeting ground for companies and startups that become involved.  Other members include the Shanghai Institute of Science, the Lujiazui Finance Internet Association and the Jiading Industrial Zone Economic Development Co, one of several economic zones within Shanghai.

42378835,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7m7ah,1473944346,Big Banks Invest $55 Million in Blockchain Startup Ripple's Series B,"Distributed ledger settlement startup Ripple has raised $55m in venture capital from a mix of financial industry heavyweights.  Participating in Ripple's Series B round are Standard Chartered, Accenture Ventures, SCB Digital Ventures, the venture arm of Siam Commercial Bank and SBI Holdings. Additional investors include Santander InnoVentures, CME Ventures, Seagate Technology and Venture 51.  With a growth trajectory that will soon force the settlement startup out of its San Francisco headquarters, much of those funds will be spent on expansion projects including sales and marketing. However, the investment is distinct for Ripple in that some of the funds could also fuel new acquisitions.  Ripple president and COO Brad Garlinghouse told CoinDesk:  ""This gives us a strong balance sheet to also consider acquisitions. There are a lot of small players doing something interesting. Historically, we wouldn’t be interested, but going forward we may be.""  In total, Ripple has raised $93m venture capital including earlier investments from Google Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz, IDG Capital Partners and Jerry Yang's AME Cloud Ventures, a figure that makes it one of most-funded blockchain firms.  While Garlinghouse wouldn’t give any details about which startups the company might have in its sights, he did reveal new information about how it would seek to evolve its strategy in the months ahead.  Customer acquistion  When Ripple was founded in 2012, the company emerged virtually without competition in its efforts to explore blockchain technology. At the time, most startups were focused solely on the bitcoin protocol, and the use of cryptographic code as currency.  But, Ripple (then called OpenCoin) was already working to distinguish itself to its potential customers, bringing to the table a novel take on the technology as well as experienced financial executives in the form of CEO Chris Larsen, who joined in 2013.  Unlike bitcoin, Ripple's consensus ledger is permissioned, meaning banks don't have to worry anonymous entities are validating transactions. Further, Ripple's distributed ledger products and services can operate without its native currency, XRP.  But, success hasn't been overnight. It took a year for the distinctness of these dual offerings to net Ripple's first customer, German Internet bank, Fidor. Four months later, the company signed its first two US banks, and within six months, the firm had signed a dozen more, according to Garlinghouse.  But Garlinghouse credits last year's Sibos banking conference for a recent burst of new customers formally announced today.  ""It was one of our largest expenses,"" he said. ""But it was also our best ROI.""  Bank partners grow  In addition to today's funding news, Ripple announced its largest batch of banks will formally join its network: Standard Chartered, Westpac, National Australia Bank (NAB), Mizuho Financial Group (MHFG), BMO Financial Group, Siam Commercial Bank and Shanghai Huarui Bank  Each financial institution has successfully transferred actual money on the Ripple network, according to the company, and all are currently building commercial products, though specific use cases vary.  As an example, Garlinghouse told CoinDesk that one of China's rare privately-owned banks, Shanghai Huarui Bank, is working with Ripple on a new commercial cross-border payment service so its retail customer base can send money internationally in real-time.  Initially, Shanghai Huarui Bank is targeting Chinese families that want to give money to students studying abroad in the US.  In total, Ripple's network now includes 15 global banks, with 10 banks in commercial deal phases. Further, it claims it has now completed 30 pilot projects.  Growth spurt  Along with the new crop of paying clients, Ripple has been experiencing other forms of growth, according to Garlinghouse.  Currently, the firm employs about 150 people and it's hiring 25 more.  Over the past quarter, more than 50% of Ripple’s hires have been engineers, he said. And he estimates that his compliance department is larger than most of the startups Ripple competes against. ""Banks need that support,"" said Garlinghouse.  Among the more notable hires this round of investment will facilitate is a lead to manage the joint venture launched earlier this year with Tokyo-based SBI Group to sell Ripple products in Japan.  Within the next six months, Garlinghouse said Ripple will outgrow its San Francisco offices and sign a deal at a new location twice the size.  He concluded:  ""We are out of office space.""

42378818,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7m7Lb,1473937862,'Big Four' Firm KPMG Talks New Blockchain Services Suite,"Global accounting firm KPMG yesterday launched a suite of tools designed to help banks and other financial services firms build with blockchain in a compliant way.  A formalization of its work with distributed ledgers, the Amsterdam-based accounting firm that last year generated $24bn revenue, in turn, has expanded its partnership with Microsoft to integrate with its blockchain-as-a-service toolkit.  But as KPMG just so happens to be one of the four biggest accounting firms in the world, its US and global lead for Digital Ledger Services told CoinDesk that the news is about more than simply advertising itself as a lead generator for Microsoft.  Eammon Maguire noted that it's important the firm remain neutral in advising clients, and that KPMG currently has multiple other strategic alliances in various stages of development.  Eamonn Maguire told CoinDesk:  ""We're bringing our own pre-existing process expertise and regulatory expertise to the table in combination with our blockchain expertise.""  To that end, KPMG's Digital Ledger Services are designed to include ""full life-cycle support"" of blockchain application development, which means the firm is offering a range of services, from business case development to systems and operations integration.  The support combines management consulting and risk consulting with regulation ""as the backbone"" of the work, according to the firm.  But while Macguire describes the Microsoft partnership as ""very important,"" he asserted that KPMG is currently looking into ""other alliances"" that would bring its services additional expertise in areas like know-your-customer compliance.  ""We have other partnerships not quite as formalized as Microsoft,"" Macguire said.  For the regulated  To help the accounting firm build compliant blockchain applications, KPMG has expanded its existing partnership with Microsoft, but that, too, was already in production.  Since March of 2015, the accounting firm has been working with the software giant to jointly develop multiple suites of services in data analytics, compliance and business solutions, and this can be seen as an expansion of that relationship.  Now, Microsoft is providing its blockchain platform to help clients in ""highly regulated"" industries including financial services, healthcare, and government.  The new area of collaboration is designed to help clients efficiently and securely move to the cloud for storage, while incorporating blockchain efficiencies.  ""We're excited to be expanding our efforts with KPMG to develop blockchain services,"" Microsoft’s director of blockchain business development, Marley Gray, said in a statement.  As indicated by interest from IBM and Microsoft, there remains a big belief among enterprises that private blockchain services will require hosting and security, both features the competing companies hope to provide.  Scaling operations  In total, KPMG has assigned about 80 people to work specifically on blockchain. Headquartered in New York, that team of specialists is dispersed throughout the US.  But according to Maguire, globally, a total of 160 people have now been cross-trained to provide blockchain services.  That global team includes the data and analytics group focusing on coding and development in support of proofs of concept, prototyping and integration of blockchain capabilities.  Several of those employees last month met in New York with representatives from each of the other ""Big Four"" accounting firms to consider the potential benefits of forming an accounting consortium.  Still in the discussion phase, the project organized by Brooklyn-based Consensys is looking into the potential benefits blockchain could bring to the accounting industry on a global scale.  Macguire told CoinDesk that an update on the status of that dialogue would be forthcoming, providing color to earlier remarks about strategic partnerships.  Eamonn concluded:  ""Eventually, we see the blockchain as a platform for the provision of services. We will get to the point where auditors and regulators will use the blockchain to perform their analysis.""

42378832,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7m7Wv,1473930917,Sydney Stock Exchange Taps Blockchain to Fight ASX Monopoly,"The Sydney Stock Exchange (SSX) is moving forward with a plan to use blockchain to instantly settle and clear transactions.  Speaking at the SINET 61 conference in Sydney today, SSX director of market development Loretta Joseph said the goal of the project, announced in May and scheduled to be completed in 2018, remains to avoid high fees charged by the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) as well as modernize its technology.  According to ZDNet, the move is one that finds SSX, established in 1997 as the Asia Pacific Stock Exchange, seeking to compete against ASX.  Joseph told the news source:  ""This provides the ideal opportunity for my little exchange to develop its own clearing settlement registration function. It means that I take control of my own destiny rather than relying on my own competitor.""  By immediately settling transactions, Joseph said she believes SSX can reduce its risk, while helping Australia emerge as a leader in harnessing blockchain technology.  Still, Joseph, who also chairs the Australian Digital Currency Commerce Association (ADCCA), said there are regulatory reforms that are needed before the exchange could implement such a system. Currently, all four licensed clearing and settlement facilities in the country are owned by ASX, according to the Bank of International Settlements.  ""It is our hope that we can lead to set policy recommendations that the government can adopt in order to facilitate blockchain-based innovations,"" Joseph said.  For the initiative, SSX will work with Bit Trade Labs, an Australia-based blockchain “production studio” boasting members of the ADCCA, as well as blockchain voting startup Flux.
