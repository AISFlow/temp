To this end, there has been a significant increase in the SHIB burn rate recorded over the last 24 hours. However, the SHIB price has had a hard time keeping up with this burn rate. SHIB Burn Rate Jumps 540% According to the Shiba Inu burn tracking website, Shibburn, the SHIB burn rate saw a tremendous burn over the last 24 hours. In total, over 78 million tokens were burned, accounting for a 542% increase in burn rate compared to the previous day.

In fact, the meme coin opened the new week with a drastic decline in burn rate. Shibburn data shows that over the last seven days, the SHIB burn rate is down 78.87%. This indicates a return in positive momentum for the burn rate, which is helping to permanently remove tokens from circulation. Additionally, it also shows that Shiba Inu investors are getting more positive about burning tokens, which could work to help the price recover. SHIB price down over 90% from ATH | Source: SHIBUSD on TradingView.com Shiba Inu Price Fails To Follow Burn Rate Despite the rapid rise in the Shiba Inu burn rate over the last day, the price of the digital asset has not responded in kind. SHIB is still lagging behind, recording losses even at a time when digital assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are back on the rise. SHIB is now one of the worst-performing coins when comparing its present price to its all-time high. The meme coin is now almost 91% down from its all-time high price back in 2021 with the vast majority of investors nursing losses on their holdings. Related Reading: Here’s What Caused Bitcoin’s Flash Crash To $29,000 However, the cryptocurrency is performing well compared to its cycle low. After hitting its lowest point this cycle back on June 10, it is 34% up from that level, although this barely makes a dent in the losses of its investors. At the time of this writing, SHIB is changing hands at a price of $0.0000076, according to data from Coinmarketcap. Its market cap has declined rapidly this year, pushing it down to $4.52 billion, making it the 19th-largest cryptocurrency in the space. SHIB’s daily trade volume is currently sitting at $115 million, a 3.24% from the previous day’s figures.

14515845,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=541153,1688508030,Litecoin Primed For 13% Rally Soon Upon Breaking Past This Level,"Litecoin has demonstrated a consistently positive trend in recent weeks, reflecting a strong market sentiment. As the broader market has gained strength in recent trading sessions, Litecoin has managed to sustain its gains. The price of Bitcoin has surpassed $31,000 at present, resulting in an upward movement for other altcoins as well. Related Reading: XRP, Cardano Among Altcoins To Keep An Eye On: Santiment While Litecoin has not experienced significant changes in the past 24 hours, it has maintained a positive trajectory. On a weekly chart, however, the altcoin has surged by over 20%. This remarkable recovery began in June when Litecoin broke through the $70 price mark, and since then, the coin has gained more than 50%. From a technical outlook, the Litecoin outlook aligns with the bullish sentiment. Both demand and accumulation indicators on the chart have remained high, suggesting the possibility of further gains. However, there is an important resistance to consider. In the upcoming days, Litecoin is expected to experience a surge due to its halving event scheduled for 3rd August 2023. Additionally, the market capitalization of Litecoin has also improved, indicating an increase in demand for the cryptocurrency. Litecoin Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, LTC was priced at $106. Although the altcoin is below its resistance level of $108, this particular level is not the main obstacle. The crucial challenge for Litecoin lies in gaining sufficient strength to surpass the $115 resistance, a level at which the coin has historically faced rejection. In April of the previous year, Litecoin approached this level but could not sustain trading above it for the remainder of the year. Conversely, if Litecoin fails to break through the $115 resistance, it could experience a decline toward the $103 support level. Further downward movement from this point would bring LTC below the $100 mark, indicating a complete invalidation of the bullish intent. Technical Analysis The price surge from the $90 level in Litecoin has significantly bolstered investor confidence. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator reached the overvalued zone, indicating increased buying activity. Although it retraced slightly from the overbought territory, it remained above the 60-mark, indicating sustained buying strength in the market. Furthermore, the LTC price movement was supported because it remained above the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line. This suggests that buyers have assumed market control and are driving the price momentum. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator formed tall green histograms, indicating favorable buy signals for LTC. This suggests the potential for continued bullishness in the market. Additionally, the Bollinger Bands on the chart were wide open, indicating increased price volatility. The upper band coincided with one of the resistance levels at $108.

14514183,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=541135,1688504417,Bitcoin Bulls Stampede: Bitfinex Report Points To Early Signs Of Bull Market,"Bitfinex, one of the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges, has released a report indicating that Bitcoin (BTC) has been sold in profit since its initial break above $30,000, suggesting early signs of a bull market. The report highlights two key on-chain metrics, the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) and Net Unrealised Profit and Loss (NUPL), which suggest that Bitcoin has entered the early stages of a bull market. Bitcoin Sold In Profit The report notes that BTC’s price broke above the crucial $29,500 mark for the second time this year on June 21st and had been bracketing in the range between this level and the $31,000 level since then. This range has always acted as a pivotal point in deciding the trend for the crypto market and, as such, is a major psychological level. The SOPR has been above one for about two weeks now since the BTC price broke above the crucial $29,500 level, indicating that people are, on average, selling their Bitcoin at a profit. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Price Targets 40% Rally Amid Strong Fundamentals The report also breaks down the events following the break above the $29,500 level and the subsequent range of the market between that and the $31,000 level from an order flow perspective. It notes that there is a high probability that the move away from the current range for Bitcoin is decisive since a retest of the range after a move up or down would mean it is likely to act as a crucial rebound zone when and if the price returns to it. However, the report warns that the next move out of the current range will be decisive and violent, which is unusual for the BTC price of late. BTC Dominates Digital Asset Flows According to the latest Coin Shares report, investors continue to pour money into digital asset investment products, with a second week of inflows totaling $125 million. The last two weeks have seen inflows of $334 million, representing almost 1% of total assets under management (AuM). Bitcoin remains the primary focus of investors, accounting for $123 million of inflows, or 98% of all digital asset flows. Recent price appreciation has seen AuM rise to $37 billion, matching the average AuM for 2022 and reaching the highest point since early June. Despite recent bullishness for Bitcoin, short-Bitcoin investment products saw their 10th week of outflows, totaling $0.9 million and representing 59% of AuM. Nevertheless, short-Bitcoin remains the second-best performing asset in terms of inflows year-to-date, with $60 million. Related Reading: Maker (MKR) Outperforms Top Coins With 12% Increase A Day, Will It Test $1100? On the other hand, a selection of altcoins saw minor inflows, with Ethereum leading the way at $2.7 million, followed by Cardano, Polygon, and XRP. Multi-asset and Solana saw minor outflows of $1.8 million and $0.8 million, respectively. The report suggests that investors remain bullish on Bitcoin, with inflows representing a significant portion of total assets under management. However, the continued outflows of short-Bitcoin investment products indicate some investors are betting against the cryptocurrency’s short-term performance. BTC has failed to consolidate above the $31,000 mark for two consecutive days. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $30,900, representing a decline of 0.3% in the last 24 hours. The failure to consolidate above $31,000 could indicate a lack of buyer interest, potentially leading to further downside pressure on the cryptocurrency. It remains to be seen whether BTC can regain its footing and make another attempt at breaking through this crucial level.

14512422,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=541144,1688500841,"Ethereum Whale Transactions Jump Over 50% As ETH Eyes $2,000","Ethereum whales have been ramping up their activities on the blockchain as it eyes an important level. This time around, their recent spike in activity has been in the form of transactions. These whale transactions which are carrying at least $100,000, making it so only large holders could be behind the transactions, have been on the rise. Mostly, the Ethereum whales ramped up their activities following ETH’s price increase over the last week. The first spike was noticed after the crypto broke above $1,900 and as it has continued to maintain this level, there has been more consistency among the whales. Related Reading: Maker (MKR) Outperforms Top Coins With 12% Increase A Day, Will It Test $1100? IntoTheBlock data shows that ETH whales have doubled their transaction counts over a few days. This increase saw their total transactions go from 2,120 to 3,230 in two days. This jump in number of transactions translates to an over 54% increase in just 48 hours – from July 2 to July 4. In a 7-day period, almost $20 billion has been moved by ETH whales. ETH whale transactions cross 3,000 in two days | Source: IntoTheBlock However, while this jump is significant in its own right, it is not unusual for Ethereum to see such a high number of large transactions. For example, toward the end of June, the total whale transactions had also spiked above the $3,000 level. Ethereum’s holder base is made up of a high number of whales when compared to its largest competitor Bitcoin. While the latter’s whale holders only make up 11% of the total holder base, Ethereum whale wallets account for 42% of its total wallets, according to data from IntoTheBlock. Hence, a high volume of large transactions happening in a short period is not out of place. How The Ethereum Whales Can Affect Price A high number of whale transactions can have significant impacts on the price of coins like Ethereum depending on what the holders of these coins intend to do with them. If these transactions carrying at least $100,000 worth of coins are for selling, then the price of ETH would see a downtrend. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Soar To $140,000 In Next Bull Cycle, Crypto Analysis Channel However, since the price of ETH has remained relatively stable and maintained its hold on the $1,900 support, then it is likely that these whales are just moving their coins around without selling. Additionally, these on-chain transactions do not point toward a good volume of ETH flowing toward centralized exchanges, further giving credence to the fact that these whales are not moving their coins for selling purposes. Ethereum, on its own, has not had the best of days though as its trading volume is down significantly from Monday. It is currently sitting at $6 billion, a 27% decline from Monday’s figures. Nevertheless, its price is holding steady with meager gains of 0.1% as the coin trades at a price of $1,963.

However, amidst this frenzy, InQubeta, an AI altcoin, has piqued the curiosity of investors and is being selected as the go-to investment. In this article, we will explain what makes InQubeta stand out in the crypto landscape. Join us as we delve into Bitcoin hard forks and explore why smart investors are doubling down on the AI token InQubeta. InQubeta (QUBE): The token not to miss out on Defying all expectations, smart investors are doubling down on InQubeta, despite the surge in the price of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin SV (BSV). The commitment to investment in its utility token, QUBE, is largely responsible for it being an AI altcoin and for its revolutionary idea of solving a critical problem in the industry. InQubeta is the world's first crowdfunding platform built for AI businesses to raise capital as well as for investors to acquire interests in promising projects. Its marketplace will allow investors to invest in AI startups by purchasing fractionalized investment opportunities. Its fractional investment model reinforced investors' commitment towards investment as its innovative idea allows ownership of fractions of AI startups and eliminates investment limits. In addition, the gains that come from being an investor and holder further bolster confidence in the project. For instance, as one of the fastest-growing industries, investors stand to gain ridiculously high profits by investing early in promising AI projects. Additionally, the coin is expected to benefit from the increasing adoption of AI, which means it will soar in the coming months, making it a more compelling investment.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) experiences a significant surge during Bitcoin’s rally Bitcoin Cash (BCH) came about from a hard fork in the blockchain, aimed at increasing the block size limit to make it more scalable by enabling cheaper and faster transactions. Bitcoin Cash’s (BCH) price movement has been largely unimpressive this year, as it hovered for the most part below $146. However, a price upturn on June 21 saw Bitcoin Cash trade above $200, although it has been experiencing a slight decline in price. Its rally came during Bitcoin’s (BTC) rally, showing its dependency. However, despite Bitcoin Cash’s uptrends, investors are still keen on investing in or diversifying parts of their investments in InQubeta because of its immense growth potential. Bitcoin SV (BSV) trades in tandem with Bitcoin (BTC) as it rallies alongside Bitcoin SV (BSV) emerged after a hard fork of Bitcoin Cash blockchain, making it one of Bitcoin’s hard forks even if not directly. Bitcoin SV, which stands for “Bitcoin Satoshi Vision,” sought to restore what is considered the original vision of Bitcoin as outlined by its creator. As Bitcoin’s hard fork, Bitcoin SV often mirrors its price movement, which is currently on a rally. After Bitcoin SV’s bearish descent from mid-May to the middle of June, Bitcoin SV regained bullish momentum and has been on a price swing. Despite its upswing, investors are still doubling down on InQubeta. Conclusion Despite the surge of Bitcoin’s hard forks like Bitcoin SV and Bitcoin Cash, InQubeta has emerged as a shining star and captured the attention of investors. Its trailblazing idea that combines AI with the limitless potential of blockchain technology, as well as exponential returns on investment, has led investors to double down. As a worthwhile investment, it has been experiencing huge presale participation, which will increase further in the coming week. To participate in the presale, click on the link below.

As of June 2023, as reported by the FATF, more than half of the UN member countries have failed to enforce the Travel Rule. According to the Financial Action Task Force, the rule is necessary in order to close a loophole in crypto assets that might be exploited by money launderers and those funding terrorism. According to an article in the Business Times Online, the Travel Rule is recommendation #16 of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) which lays down that all crypto companies must “screen, record and communicate the information of all users of their platform”. This would have the effect of destroying any anonymity for crypto users, with the exception of those who are transacting in amounts less than $1,000. What is the FATF? The FATF is a 39-member body that gives financial recommendations to all UN nations. Given that it is an unelected body, financial decisions in each country are the responsibility of that country and the recommendations can be implemented or not by each country. However, should any country choose not to implement all of the recommendations then it comes under “increased monitoring” of its financial activities. AML and terrorist financing According to the FATF, at the heart of all the recommendations are a desire to root out any money laundering or terrorist financing that might be taking place in a country’s financial system. This purportedly gives it the right and full authority to investigate how money is dealt with everywhere in the world. The FATF is of the opinion that crypto assets can be used for the aforementioned illegal activities and therefore wants all countries to enforce the Travel Rule in order to negate any of these activities. Many jurisdictions ignore recommendations The fact that nearly three quarters of jurisdictions across the world have complied only partially or not at all with the FATF recommendations perhaps says much for a feeling that this non-elected agency is maybe interfering too much in the financial affairs of sovereign countries. Also, given that the FATF is closely associated with the IMF and the World Bank, it might be seen as having a more ‘Western’ bias that may not be as acceptable to certain jurisdictions across the world.

The upcoming Periander upgrade brings significant enhancements to the Tron Network, while TRX experiences a surge in on-chain metrics. Tron Network’s latest update, Great Voyage—v4.7.2 (Periander), introduces four critical upgrades aimed at enhancing the functionality and usability of the network. These upgrades include an advanced Stake 2.0 mechanism, seamless compatibility with Ethereum’s EIP-3855, streamlined smart contract interface calling, and a revamped P2P network module. Tron’s Periander Upgrade The new Stake 2.0 mechanism offers users greater flexibility in staking and unstaking their resources, with the ability to customize lockup periods for delegated resources according to their individual needs. The compatibility with Ethereum’s EIP-3855 promotes interoperability between the two ecosystems, attracting more developers to TRON and reducing migration costs for projects across both chains. Related Reading: XRP, Cardano Among Altcoins To Keep An Eye On: Santiment On the other hand, the streamlined smart contract interface calling provides developers with estimated transaction fees for deploying their contracts, simplifying the development of smart contracts. Finally, the revamped P2P network module enhances the connection efficiency, availability, scalability, and transmission efficiency of the TRON network. TRON founder Justin Sun emphasized the organization’s commitment to fostering the growth of the TRON ecosystem, attracting more developers, capital, and users to the platform. With over 169 million users worldwide, TRON has processed more than 6 billion transactions and boasts a total value locked (TVL) of over $5 billion. It has built a comprehensive ecosystem encompassing NFTs, DeFi, GameFi, stablecoins, the metaverse, and cross-chain solutions, and hosts the largest USDT circulating supply worth over $46 billion, making it an industry leader. Overall, the TRON MainNet Periander upgrade brings significant improvements to the Tron Network, providing greater flexibility, compatibility, and efficiency to its users and developers. The upgrade encourages greater participation in the network, attracts more developers to the platform, and stimulates the growth of the ecosystem. The revamped P2P network module provides a robust infrastructure that empowers developers and users to explore new possibilities and drive innovation within the TRON ecosystem. On-chain Metrics Show Bullish Trend For TRX As the TRON Network’s upgrade day approaches, the platform has experienced a notable uptick in its on-chain metrics, according to data from DeFiLlama. Since the beginning of the month, TRX’s trading volume has seen a gradual increase, which indicates that there is growing demand for the token. In the last few days, TRX’s trading volume has reached over $9 million. Additionally, the network activity on TRON has also been rising in recent weeks. On-chain activity, such as the number of transactions and unique addresses, is an essential metric to consider. In the lead-up to the upgrade, TRON’s on-chain activity has increased, which suggests that there is a growing demand for TRX. In the last three days alone, there have been over 20 million transactions on the TRON network. This growing network activity and usage of the TRON network are positive indicators for the TRON ecosystem and could lead to further growth in the future. Related Reading: Coinbase Stock Soars Nearly 12% As BlackRock Reveals Surveillance Partnership On the flip side, TRX has been on an uptrend since June 20th, starting from a value of $0.06788 and now trading above the $0.07784 mark. This represents a considerable gain of 13% over the last 14 days and 4% in the seven-day period. However, TRX is currently facing its yearly high resistance at the same trading level. This could potentially create a delay in reaching new yearly highs if it is unable to surpass its nearest resistance.

ALEX is built on Polygon, a blockchain network known for its scalability, speed, and security. By leveraging the capabilities of Polygon, ALEX is creating a digital gaming world called the Miracle Verse. This innovative ecosystem will empower users with play-to-earn gaming opportunities, social trading, and DeFi activities. With its gamified approach and extensive suite of products under development, ALEX aims to differentiate itself from other memecoins and gain a foothold in the market. The project operates at the intersection of GameFi and SocialFi, the latter term describing the creation of strong communities that are united by shared interests and common goals. An extensive roadmap gives interested parties an idea of what to expect from the ALEX ecosystem as it takes shape, with the launch of the Miracle Verse sure to be an eagerly anticipated event. Through combining the fun factor synonymous with memecoins and the utility built into decentralized finance applications, the team behind Alex The Doge believes it has found a winning formula. The completion of the ALEX presale will set the stage for everything that comes next, starting with the token’s DEX debut as Alex The Doge goes live.

14507278,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=541073,1688490041,"75% Of Bitcoin Supply Now In Profit, Will A Drop Happen Here?","On-chain data shows 75% of the entire Bitcoin circulating supply is now in profit, something that could lead to a drop for the asset. Bitcoin Supply In Profit Has Registered An Uptick Recently As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, there may be a risk that the investors would participate in profit-taking here. The “supply in profit” is an indicator that, as its name already implies, measures the total amount of the circulating Bitcoin supply that’s currently holding an unrealized gain. The metric works by going through the on-chain history of each coin in circulation to see what price it was last moved/transferred at. If this previous price for any coin was less than the current spot price of the asset, then that particular coin is said to be holding a profit right now, and the indicator adds it up to its value. The “supply in loss” is the counterpart indicator of the supply in profit, and it naturally keeps track of the coins of the opposite type (that is, the coins with a higher acquisition price than the latest spot price). When the supply in profit goes up in value, it means that more investors are coming into profit. Generally, the more an investor gets in profit, the more likely they become to sell. So, a large amount of the supply carrying some gains can lead to a widespread selloff becoming more probable in the sector. Related Reading: Historical Litecoin Bearish Signal Goes Off, Correction Incoming? Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 7-day simple moving average (SMA) Bitcoin supply in profit over the history of the cryptocurrency: Looks like the 7-day SMA value of the metric has been going up in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As displayed in the above graph, the 7-day SMA Bitcoin supply in profit has observed a sharp surge recently. This spike in the metric has taken place as the rally in the cryptocurrency’s price towards the $31,000 level has occurred and has put a large number of investors into gains. At the current values of the indicator, coins equivalent to about 75% of the total circulating supply of the cryptocurrency are carrying some amount of unrealized profit. Naturally, this would mean that a lot of investors may be thinking about harvesting some of the gains that they have accumulated. If the holders do end up selling here, then the price of the asset could observe a drawdown, at least in the short term. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sharks & Whales Show Strong Buying, Rally To Continue In July? From the chart, it’s visible that the current level of the indicator is around where the asset hit a local top back in April of this year, and it’s also the same value where the cryptocurrency faced resistance in early 2022. It now remains to be seen if the market can pull through this psychological barrier and allow the Bitcoin rally to continue further.

While the House of Lords didn't make changes to crypto aspects of the bill, during earlier proceedings it was amended to ensure the measures extended to terrorism cases and measures to help authorities seize property that can help identify crypto linked to crime were added. Plus, an amendment was added to ensure courts can ask authorities to seize and freeze crypto used for crime.  In March, the government said combating criminal abuse of crypto was a part of its three-year economic crime agenda. The country has introduced crypto tactical advisers to police departments nationwide to help identify and seize digital assets tied to crime.  ""Domestic and international criminals have for years laundered the proceeds of their crime and corruption by abusing U.K. company structures, and are increasingly using cryptocurrencies,"" Graeme Biggar, director general of the National Crime Agency, said in a September statement when the bill was introduced. ""These reforms – long awaited and much welcomed – will help us crack down on both.""  Approval by the Lords means the bill returns to the House of Commons for the final stages before it is put into law. Once both houses agree on the document, the king will need to sign it into law.

The leading cryptocurrency, currently enjoying a strong position in the market, could be poised for a significant climb, according to AJ, an analyst from BitBoy Crypto. This forecast comes at a time when Bitcoin continues to captivate institutional investors and attract large funds interested in capitalizing on its sustained growth. Bold Bitcoin Prediction Amid Growing Institutional Interest AJ’s latest analysis for Bitcoin points to a potential climb to $140,000 in the next bullish cycle. This prediction, particularly ambitious in its scope, follows BlackRock’s recent filing for a Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). Related Reading: Analyst’s Forecast: Bitcoin (BTC) To Hit $310,000 If This Happens This move sparked a chain reaction with several other large funds submitting their own filings, further underscoring Bitcoin’s burgeoning influence in the crypto landscape. Additionally, AJ forecasted that Bitcoin is set to consolidate its share of the crypto market in the coming years. This notion stems from two key factors: Bitcoin’s distinct position as a non-security digital asset, unlike various altcoins, along with its pioneering status in the market that has garnered institutional investor attention. According to AJ, Bitcoin’s dominance in the crypto market will not wane in the foreseeable future. He, however, did not dismiss the potential for Ethereum (ETH) to possibly surpass Bitcoin in terms of market capitalization in the long term. However, from a tokenomics perspective, Bitcoin stands out significantly from most altcoins. Currently, 92% of Bitcoin’s maximum supply is in circulation, contrasting sharply with several crypto projects, where only approximately 50% of their max supply ranging from 500 million to 1 trillion tokens is in circulation. BTC Climb And Market Cap Increase Wrapping up his speculation, the BitBoy Crypto analyst surmised that Bitcoin’s value could increase to somewhere between $100,000 and $140,000 in the next bull market. Moreover, he projected that Bitcoin’s market capitalization would reach at least $2 trillion, provided his bullish thesis holds true. This BTC prediction is just one out of the many Bitcoin predictions reported in the past weeks. Last week, renowned analyst Willy Woo sets forth a prediction suggesting Bitcoin could potentially scale up to a price of $310,000 under a specific set of circumstances. These conditions included institution players allocating 5% of their Assets Under Management (AUM) into BTC. Related Reading: Nansen Forecast For Bitcoin Bull Run: Regulatory Clarity And Lower Inflation Weeks prior, another crypto analyst Credible Crypto predicted that Bitcoin could reclaim its previous peak of $69,000 based on the assumption of a continuing “parabolic advance” Regardless, BTC currently trades above $31,000 at the time of writing.

Bloomberg reports South Africa’s Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) said cryptocurrency exchanges operating within the country must apply for licenses before year end to continue their operations. FSCA Commissioner Unathi Kamlana said in an interview that the authority received about 20 applications since opening licenses a few weeks ago and expects more to be submitted before the deadline on November 20. Kamlana said the FSCA plans to take “enforcement action” against exchanges that continue to operate without a license after the deadline, adding that firms could be closed down or fined. The Commissioner said: There is potentially serious harm to financial customers when using crypto products, and therefore it makes sense for us to introduce the regulatory framework. Time will tell the effectiveness of our measures, and we will continue to work together with the industry to refine and make changes where and if necessary. Exchanges which operate in South Africa include Binance, the Digital Currency Group-owned Luno, and the Pantera Capital-backed VALR. All these exchanges need to secure licenses if they wish to continue their operations. Regulators Step Up Crypto Oversight South Africa’s tightened crypto oversight comes after a string of bankruptcies in 2022 caused the market to spiral. The collapse of FTX was the catalyst which heightened scrutiny of crypto firms and exchanges. EU regulators formally signed its landmark Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) into law on May 31, with measures set to take force in 2024. European legislators also formally enacted another law on anti-money laundering, which mandates crypto providers to authenticate their customers’ identities when conducting wire transfers. The UK also voted to pass into law its Financial Services and Markets bill, which will see the country on its way to dealing with crypto as a “regulated activity.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The recent sell-off to the 29417.14 area represented a test of the 38.2% retracement of the appreciating range from 26165.98 to 31443.67. This depreciation occurred after BTC/USD rallied higher to the 30277 area, its strongest print in several trading sessions, and increased the possibility of a test of the 28604.83 area. The pair’s recent print around the 31443.67 area was a twelve-month high and test of an upside price objective associated with buying pressure that strengthened around the 26637.41 area.

Stops were also recently triggered above additional upside price objectives around the 29068, 29159, 29458, 30088, 30200, 30292, and 30477 levels.

Supply of bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, dropped 4%, nearing the level of December 2022, itself the lowest since November 2020 – and right before the start of the 2021 bull market, the report said. Ether supply slid 5.8% to levels not seen since May 2018.  This trend is underpinned by a number of factors, the bank said.  “Major centralized spot exchanges are facing regulatory headwinds putting investors on alert, cyber hacks and theft continue to be a concern across the crypto markets, highlighting asset holders’ preference for self custody, in line with the popular adage ‘not your keys, not your coins’, and specifically for ether, the enablement of staked ether withdrawals has resulted in investors’ preference to stake ether, instead of passively holding on exchanges,” the report said.  Goldman noted that June was a record month for bitcoin miners’ inventory sales as miners took advantage of the cryptocurrency’s strong performance. Total monthly BTC inflows from miners to exchanges almost doubled from May to $99 million, it said. The bitcoin price rose almost 12%, TradingView data show.  As transaction fees returned to normal in June following the network congestion seen in May, monthly address activity for bitcoin and ether saw a rebound, gaining 15.5% and 37.5% respectively, the report added. Average daily ether burnt fell by 65.1% and average daily fees dropped by 63.3% on a month-on-month basis, Goldman noted.  Last month also saw an increase in new on-chain activity, with the daily average new address count for bitcoin and ether increasing by 9.8% and 48.2% compared with a month earlier, the note said.

Among the soaring coins is MakerDAO’s governance token Maker (MKR). MKR witnessed impressive price performance in the last seven days, outpacing top cryptocurrencies with over a 48% price increase on the weekly top gainers’ chart. CoinMarketCap data shows that Maker (MKR) price recorded a significant gain of 46.78% among top gainers over the past 30 days. As of the time of writing, the token has recorded a 24-hour price increase of 12.96%. Maker’s Price Movement in The Past Week Maker’s bullish price action attracted the attention of market participants after climbing to over $1,000 from a price of $677 recorded on June 28. Although it recorded pullbacks here and there, MKR price still saw massive rallies within the past seven days. Related Reading: USDC Circulating Supply Down 38% Since Jan. 1 – Will It Affect Price? The token price experienced a slight dip after trading at $704 on June 25. However, it recovered momentum and rose from $677.88 on June 28 to $834 on June 30, a 21% increase from the June 28 opening price. Maker rode a consistent bullish wave to its current price of $1,032, with a 49% gain over the past seven days. Since the start of June, MKR has recorded two major price rallies. From July 1, MKR’s price surged 21%, rising above $830 from $687 on June 30. MKR token’s valuation increased by 8% in the early hours of July 3, bringing the price to $929.87, a 3-month high since March. The token’s trading volume has also spiked, suggesting increased market activity and buying pressure. At press time, Maker’s trading volume is at $117 million, with a 71.53% increase in the last day. Maker saw a sharp spike in trading volume from June 28. The trading volume went from $25 million to $126 million on June 30 before dipping below $70 million. However, data shows the bulls are back as the uptick in trading volume resumed on July 3 and now stands at $125 million. Moreover, the overall protocol performance has improved. MakerDAO is in second place in DefiLlama’s protocol rankings. It is trailing behind Lido with a TVL of $6.205 billion. The protocol recorded a 24-hour decline of 0.92% and a 1-month increase of 0.97%. Factors Influencing Maker (MKR)’s Price Performance The specific factor driving MKR’s price action remains unclear. But the overall positive sentiment in the broader crypto market appears to have robbed off on the token. Spark Protocol, a Maker-powered lending platform launched on May 8, 2023, and appears to have received increased user interest. Spark Protocol developers, Phoenix Labs, launched a multi-chain proposal for Spark Protocol to allow cross-chain deposits and withdrawals for DAI borrowers. Related Reading: PEPE Breaches Local Highs With 20% Leap In Surprise Comeback Currently, DAI borrowing on Spark Protocol has surpassed the previous debt ceiling of 5 million DAI to 8.16 million.

Social Dominance Of Altcoins Like XRP & Cardano Has Remained Low Recently According to data from the analytics firm Santiment, Bitcoin is seeing the greatest attention in the market right now, while some of the alts aren’t being talked about that much. The indicator of interest here is “social dominance,” to understand which the “social volume” needs to be looked at first. The social volume is a metric that measures the total amount of unique social media posts/threads that are making mentions of a given asset or term. By “unique,” what’s meant here is that the indicator only counts these posts once regardless of how many times they mention the term (obviously, as long as they make at least one mention). If the metric counted the pure number of mentions instead, then a thread with a large number of mentions could raise the count by itself, even if mentions may be low everywhere else on social media. Thus, to obtain a more accurate representation of the trend in the wider market, the social volume only considers unique posts. Now, social dominance is an indicator that compares the social volume of a given cryptocurrency with the combined social volume of the top 100 assets (by market cap) in the sector. Related Reading: Historical Litecoin Bearish Signal Goes Off, Correction Incoming? Here is a chart that shows the trend in the social dominance of the five largest coins in the market: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), BNB (BNB), XRP (XRP), and Cardano (ADA): Looks like the value of the metric has stayed low for the altcoins | Source: Santiment on Twitter As displayed in the above graph, the social dominance of Bitcoin has been high since the rally started around the start of the year. The asset has been leading the price surge in these last few months, so it’s not particularly surprising that the interest in the cryptocurrency has been elevated during this period. Discussions around BTC on social media had been dropping slightly last month when FUD had been going around in the market, but with the latest leg in the rally above the $30,000 level, interest has once again spiked in the coin. While this has happened, however, the other top assets like XRP have only observed a sideways trend or a drawdown in their respective social dominance. This would imply that these cryptocurrencies have failed to garner any significant attention during the last couple of weeks. Related Reading: Why Bitcoin Dominance Hints At A Surprise Altcoin Season Ahead The amount of discussion that Bitcoin is seeing, though, isn’t always a good sign, as too much excitement has historically often resulted in the formation of a local top. On the contrary, as the alts aren’t getting too much attention currently, they may have the potential for observing more price rise. Cardano, BNB, and XRP, in particular, have pretty low values of the indicator right now, which, according to Santiment, makes them worth keeping an eye on. XRP Price At the time of writing, XRP is trading around $0.48, up 1% in the last week.

In an effort to combat fraud and tighten its grip on cryptocurrency transactions, the Belarusian government is contemplating a ban on peer-to-peer (P2P) crypto trading. The proposed crackdown aims to protect consumers and prevent illegal activities within the cryptocurrency market. P2P crypto trading refers to the exchange of cryptocurrency between two individuals directly, without the involvement of a third party like a crypto exchange. Belarus, known for its relatively lenient stance on cryptocurrency, embraced blockchain technology and even legalized cryptocurrency mining and exchange activities in 2017. It has been called one of the most crypto-friendly countries in the world, as it offers a tax exemption for individuals and businesses conducting crypto transactions. A year ago, President Lukashenko even signed a decree to ratify the free circulation of cryptocurrencies in the country. Trying To Curb Money Laundering The country’s Ministry of Internal Affairs released a statement on Sunday revealing that malicious actors were using the P2P crypto services to transact dirty funds. The statement read, “Since the beginning of the year, employees of the cybercrime counteraction units have stopped the activities of 27 citizens who provide illegal cryptocurrency exchange services. Their total illegal income amounted to almost 22 million rubles ($8.7 million).” As a result, the proposed ban seeks to restrict the direct exchange of cryptocurrencies between individuals without any intermediary platform. By eliminating P2P trading, Belarus hopes to curb fraudulent schemes and money laundering attempts that have been prevalent in the country's crypto space. The notice also explained that citizens would be able to conduct such financial transactions only through the registered exchanges in order to promote transparency and government control. How Will Ban Affect Belarus’s Crypto Landscape? The decision comes amidst rising instances of fraud within the country's cryptocurrency sector. Scammers have taken advantage of the anonymous nature of P2P transactions to carry out various fraudulent schemes, defrauding unsuspecting individuals of their hard-earned money. Although critics have argued that a blanket ban on P2P crypto trading may stifle innovation and hinder the growth of the industry, it is interesting to note that the country has recently renewed its crypto tax exemption law to be in effect till 2025. It is worth noting that the proposed ban on P2P crypto trading in Belarus is still in the discussion stage. The government is expected to consult with industry experts and stakeholders to carefully weigh the potential consequences before finalizing any regulatory measures.

If the SEC approves a Bitcoin spot ETF, it could lead to a wave of new filings and increase liquidity and institutional investments in Bitcoin. Despite the potential benefits, there are risks. If MARA cannot lower its operational costs or if Bitcoin does not increase in value, the company may never profit from its mining operations. With BlackRock (BLK) filing for its own Bitcoin ETF, many are expecting Bitcoin prices to increase with SEC approval. BlackRock is not alone in these efforts as many other players are also vying for the chance to create their own Bitcoin ETF. With momentum building for Bitcoin, I believe Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc. ( MARA ) is a buy as the rising value of Bitcoin will improve the profitability of its mining operations. SEC approval for Bitcoin ETFs could open the floodgates for Bitcoin demand - potentially causing MARA stock to rally as a result. Spot Bitcoin ETF There have been 30 failed applications to launch spot Bitcoin ETFs from players like ARK, Valkyrie, and Invesco, which is why I was surprised when BlackRock filed for its own Bitcoin ETF, especially since it has Coinbase (COIN) as its Bitcoin custodian. So for BlackRock to apply for its own Bitcoin ETF and have Coinbase as its custodian indicates that it may know something the market doesn't. Another reason to be bullish on BlackRock's application is its very high approval rate. For all of its 576 filings , BlackRock has a 99.82% approval rate, meaning it's been rejected only once. It seems BlackRock is ""not uncertain"" that it will be approved, and it looks even more likely now that the SEC has approved the first Leveraged Bitcoin Futures ETF. This decision follows its earlier approval of other bitcoin futures ETFs like ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITO ). It seems very strange that the SEC would approve a 2x leveraged futures product before a spot ETF for BTC, which is one reason why I expect the SEC to approve a spot Bitcoin ETF soon. I believe that if one Bitcoin spot ETF is approved, it will spark a wave of new filings for Bitcoin ETFs. There are already 12 active Bitcoin ETF filings and if one is granted approval it could open the floodgates for more. Needless to say, a Bitcoin ETF would increase liquidity as well as institutional investments in Bitcoin, which is an important catalyst for MARA. Trust in Banking System As a result of the 2023 banking crisis, trust in traditional banks has declined. According to a poll released by the Associated Press, 31% of those surveyed hardly have any confidence in banking and financial institutions. The Fed expects two more interest rate hikes in 2023 , putting more pressure on regional banks. Bitcoin and decentralized finance have always been proposed as an alternative to traditional banking. The recent uncertainty and the potential opportunity for investors to invest in spot Bitcoin ETFs could bring additional liquidity to Bitcoin, thereby benefiting MARA. On the other hand, increasing interest rates have caused investors to turn away from risky assets like crypto. The two remaining rate hikes this year could dampen investors' enthusiasm for volatile assets like Bitcoin - impacting MARA's operations. But in the long term, the outlook appears much brighter as the Fed expects to begin cutting interest rates in 2024. This will gradually change investors' behavior as they become more inclined to take on high-risk, high-reward investments. Bull Case for MARA Already, BTC is up 23% on news of the BlackRock ETF; if a BTC spot ETF is approved, it could catalyze the famously volatile cryptocurrency. The added liquidity, institutional investments, and overall momentum could trigger a run for BTC. TradingView In this case, Marathon's May inventory of 12,259 BTC would appreciate in value. Additionally, MARA's mining operations would become more profitable. Looking at the last five quarters, MARA's mining operations reached its lowest total cost per Bitcoin in Q1 2023. However, it is worth noting that its total costs were offset by a $17 million gain on digital assets Quarter BTC Mined Cost of Revenue Total Cost COR per BTC TC per BTC Q1 '23 2,195 51,110,000 3,880,000 23,284 1767 Q4 '22 1,562 43,563,000 395,779,000 27,889 253,379 Q3 '22 616 40,067,397 19,268,739 65,044 31,280 Q2 '22 707 41,394,556 161,788,636 58,549 228,838 Q1 '22 1,259 26,393,636 34,450,350 20,963 27,363 Q1 2022 marked its best quarter in terms of COR per BTC and on average MARA's COR per BTC has been $39,145 based on the last five quarters. As MARA continues to ramp up BTC production and optimize its operations, I expect its TC per BTC to decrease gradually. Based on these calculations, if the price of Bitcoin stays above $23,284 MARA will break even on its energy, hosting, and other expenses. The company's total costs for Q1 2023 were impacted by a $17.6 million gain on its digital assets, but setting this aside, the company's COR and general and administrative expenses totaled $66.4 million for the quarter. With this in mind, I estimate that MARA's mining operations would become profitable - assuming that MARA was to mine 2,195 BTC - with Bitcoin's price above $30.2 thousand. Quarter Notes Q1 '23 Total cost impacted by Realized gains on digital assets sold and unrealized losses on digital assets loan receivable +$17,615,000 Q4 '22 Total cost including Impairment of mining equipment and advances to vendors ($332,933,000) Q2 '22 Total cost including Impairment of digital currencies ($127,590,231) and Change in fair value of digital currencies held in fund ($79,688,590) Marathon is operating with a hash rate of 15.2 as of May and is planning to reach 23 EH/s by the end of the year - although this was initially its mid-year goal. Considering that the company has already increased its hash rate by 291% YoY, it's made considerable operational progress. The company believes it has secured enough hosting capacity to support its target of 23.3 EH/s. Optimizing its hash rate will pay off if Bitcoin rallies, but as is, the company will need to increase its hash rate by 51% to achieve its goal of 23 EH/s. And based on BTC's current value of $30,494 the company's financial situation may improve over the coming quarters if the rally continues. Company Filings Risks My thesis is mainly focused on the potential for SEC approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. Despite BlackRock's application, there is no guarantee that the regulator will approve this financial instrument. Even with SEC approval, Bitcoin may not rally. This digital asset is known for its volatility and, as demonstrated by the recent ""crypto winter"", fluctuations in its price can negatively affect MARA's own operations - posing a significant risk to investors. As is, MARA is held back by the costs of mining Bitcoin and if it is unable to lower its costs of operation or BTC does not increase in value, then the company runs the risk of never profiting from its mining operations. Technical Analysis TradingView On the daily chart, MARA is trading in a sideways channel between $5.22 and $14.49 after breaking out of a downward trend. This is a bullish sign overall. Looking at the indicators, the stock is trading above the 200, 50, and 21 MAs, which are also bullish indications. Meanwhile, the RSI is currently overbought at 69. As for the fundamentals, MARA is up 50% following BlackRock's filing for its own Bitcoin ETF. The stock is currently testing a resistance and I expect a pullback given the overbought RSI. This could be an opportunity for investors bullish on BTC or SEC approval. I recommend buying on retests of the 21 or 50 MAs. Historically, MARA stock moves with BTC. If the crypto continues to rally, investors could hold for earnings on August 9th or take profit at retests of the resistances. However, I would warn investors that given MARA's run-up so far, if BlackRock's application is approved it could result in a sell-the-news situation given the stock is already overextended on the daily timeframe. Conclusion I personally believe it's only a matter of time until the SEC approves a spot Bitcoin ETF. BlackRock's recent application has caused quite a stir in the crypto community, and even Fed Chair Jerome Powell's statement that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have ""staying power"" are signs that there is movement in this sphere. MARA would directly benefit from a Bitcoin rally and a spot ETF would bring liquidity and institutional investors to the cryptocurrency. The company has made significant advances in its mining operations and if the price of Bitcoin consolidates above $23,284 - its COR per BTC in Q1 - then MARA's outlook could continue to improve as it works towards its EOY goal of 23.3 EH/s.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4615129-marathon-could-benefit-from-etf-talks?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/14500892.jpeg

14500803,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=541051,1688475631,Solana (SOL) Price Targets 40% Rally Amid Strong Fundamentals,"The Solana (SOL) price is currently at a crucial turning point, which will be of decisive importance for the coming weeks. If the SOL bulls manage to leap above the currently most important resistance, a rally of up to 40% could be on the cards. If the bulls lose the upper hand, another plunge of up to 21% could be imminent. Crucial Moment For The SOL Price An analysis of the 1-day chart using Fibonacci retracements shows that the SOL price is at a pivotal point for the coming weeks. At the time of writing, SOL was trading at $19.19, just below the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level. So far, SOL bulls have failed to break above this level at $19.72. If successful, the price level above $21, at which SOL was trading before the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) classification of the Solana token was announced, would again be within reach. A bit further up, the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) awaits the SOL price at $22.05 – an indicator often described as a “bull line” that SOL investors have been unable to break above since April 2022. Related Reading: Cardano, Solana, Polygon Gains Despite Revolut Plans To Delist In this bullish scenario, the 200-day EMA can be considered as the second most important challenge for SOL bulls. An upside break could allow the price to rise to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $27.00, which also marked the year-to-date high, potentially marking a 40% rally. At this level at the latest, a preliminary pause in the rally is to be expected. In a bearish case, SOL fails to capture the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level. In this case, a drop towards $15.30 is conceivable, which would represent a price loss of around 21%. Solana Displays Strong Fundamentals The renewed momentum in Solana’s price can also be attributed to strong fundamentals. Last Friday, June 30, Solana surpassed Ethereum in 24-hour NFT volume for the first time ever. Solana NFTs saw a surge in trading volume to $25.5 million, up over 1,900% day-over-day (compared to +28%, or $24.6 million for Ethereum). Related Reading: Solana Firedancer: 15% Rally Fueled By Ongoing Network Improvements Moreover, Drift Protocol’s “Super Stake” is also currently causing a stir in the Solana ecosystem. Risk-averse traders can earn an additional 10% return by leveraging Solana Staking derivatives. Marinade-SOL (mSOL) from Marinade Finance is the preferred derivative, enabling traders to deposit mSOL tokens as collateral and borrow additional SOL tokens for continuous restaking, multiplying returns up to three times. This concept draws parallels with Ethereum’s MakerDAO and its stETH Yield Multiple Staking via Aave. While there are inherent risks, demand for Super Stake remains high, pushing Solana’s maximum utilization. Super Stake serves as a catalyst for the battered DeFi ecosystem, driven by the booming NFT market. Solana’s resilience, coupled with innovative solutions like Super Stake, positions SOL for a bullish breakout.

A raft of new improvements have been specified that will make the forthcoming testnet smoother and equipped with subtle fixes that should simplify program creation and dapp deployment. The majority, if not all, of the upgrades to Vara’s stable testnet will be beyond the comprehension of the average user, but developers with experience of working in Rust will grasp the benefits they confer. Vara has listed the most important upgrades to its testnet, but the full list, including bug fixes, is extensive. Vara Steps Things Up a Notch The optimization of Vara’s testnet is a crucial stage that will support a much larger goal: to launch a highly scalable Layer1 network that can host multitudes of dapps, with no trade-offs in terms of fees, security, or throughput. To achieve this, there’s much work to be done on the testnet, where bugs are to be squashed, stability ensured, and new features added. Most of the improvements being incorporated into the latest build of Vara’s stable testnet concern smart contracts. The team developing Vara Network have been largely focused on incorporating features that make it easier to run programs and to debug them when issues are encountered. Chief among these is the introduction of automatic replies from programs. As the Vara team explains in a blog post outlining the testnet changes, “With this new update, your active program will always send a reply to an incoming message, even if its execution encounters a hiccup.” Devs working on the Vara testnet are also now relieved of adding in boilerplate code over and over thanks to a new autogenerated metahash function. Small Changes That Make a Big Difference Many of the upgrades to Vara’s new testnet may seem slight, but combined they make for a significant improvement to the current iteration. There’s a new reply deposit feature, enabling devs to provide a gas deposit from the current message to handle a future reply message. The async send functions also benefit from a new deposit argument, which Vara is billing “a game-changing improvement.” The status code retrieval in functions that handle replies or signals has also been improved and it’s now much easier to restart paused programs thanks to new extrinsics for program reactivation. The msg::origin function has been removed from gstd for security purposes, as has the obsolete delay argument which is no longer contained within function signatures related to sending replies. One of the biggest improvements to Vara’s latest testnet is the enhancement to the metadata file format supported. It will now accommodate multiple languages aside from Rust. Finally, the Vara team has made numerous bug fixes that should improve the running of dapps and contracts deployed on its testnet. All told, these changes should bring the testnet to a state much closer to that resembling the mainnet, whose deployment looms closer.

This surge comes on the heels of the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, choosing Coinbase as a surveillance partner for its re-filed Bitcoin ETF application. In the limelight of this crypto-mainstream finance crossover, Coinbase’s shares have soared by a nearly 12% over the past day. Renewed BlackRock Application Spurs Coinbase Growth Nasdaq disclosed on July 3 that BlackRock, the eminent entity in worldwide asset management, had updated its proposal for a spot Bitcoin ETF, incorporating new specifics about a ‘surveillance-sharing agreement’ with Coinbase. Related Reading: SEC Sues Binance, Coinbase Then BlackRock Files For Bitcoin Spot ETF; Is This An Inside Job? This news triggered a bullish response in the market, and Coinbase shares skyrocketed, marking a significant day in the crypto market landscape. The details in the application outline an agreement between Nasdaq and Coinbase forged last month. The pact, intended to “supplement the exchange’s market surveillance program,” provides Nasdaq access to spot BTC trade data. The report revealed that should BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF gain approval, Nasdaq expects to leverage the data obtained from Coinbase in surveilling the trading. Notably, the regulatory landscape around cryptocurrencies in the US remains a hotbed of speculation and anticipation. While the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) has granted approval to a number of futures-based ETFs, a spot-based one, physically backed by the asset as opposed to CME contracts, has not yet been given the green light. Refiled applications for multiple companies looking to launch spot BTC funds emerged last week, facilitated by Cboe. This includes Fidelity, WisdomTree, VanEck, and Invesco, all of which have listed Coinbase as a surveillance-sharing partner, further amplifying Coinbase’s critical role in the process. Nate Geraci, the President of ETF Store, believes that the launch of a spot Bitcoin ETF will shatter previous ETF launch records. It is worth noting that with such optimistic industry sentiments, Coinbase’s crucial part in this narrative solidifies their importance. COIN Surges Nearly 12% In response to BlackRock’s endorsement, Coinbase shares saw an upsurge of nearly 12% in the past day. Consequently, COIN is trading just below $80, at the time of writing up by 11.71%. The company stock has since been in a bullish trend since the beginning of 2023, outpacing the crypto market, which has gained roughly over 50% in the same period. Particularly, larger crypto assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum have seen a massive surge since the year began, and BTC currently trades above $30,000 after briefly trading at $31,000 yesterday.

Winklevoss Calls Out Silbert In an interesting turn of events, Cameron Winklevoss, co-founder of Gemini, has made a final offer demanding a payment of $1.47 billion from DCG’s CEO Barry Silbert. He also threatened the latter with legal action if the final payment offer was not met by the deadline of July 6, 4 PM ET. Winklevoss claimed that the legal action would include a detailed report of Silbert’s personal liability in hiding Genesis’s insolvency issues and filing a Turnover Motion to force the immediate payment of the $630 million payment owed to creditors. DCG’s Credit Struggles When Genesis’s parent company DCG got caught up in the credit crisis of 2022, the latter entered into negotiations with creditors. However, the company did miss a $630 million payment to Genesis in May, which has now led to Cameron Winklevoss penning the open letter to Silbert, with the final offer of a $1.47 compensation. This substantial amount reflects the magnitude of the alleged damages and underlines the seriousness of the accusations against DCG and Silbert. “Game Over”: Winklevoss Winklevoss posted the open letter on Twitter on Monday, claiming that Silbert had never had any intentions of resolving the matter with the creditors in mind ever since the company had halted its withdrawals. He claimed that instead of working on a proper resolution to return their funds to the Earn users, Silbert and his team have dedicated the last eight months to buy time, to “raise money and stiff creditors and Earn users again.” He wrote, “I write to inform you that your games are over. In addition to dragging out a resolution, they have ballooned professional fees to over $100 million, all of which have gone to lawyers and advisors at the expense of creditors and Earn users. Enough is enough.” $1.2B Owed To Earn Customers The demand comes amidst allegations of fraud involving Barry Silbert, founder of DCG, and has sparked widespread speculation within the cryptocurrency community. Gemini had previously lent customer funds to Genesis under the Earn program. Winklevoss claimed that more than 232,000 Earn users have over $1.2 billion of assets trapped in Genesis.

""Bitcoin is digesting its gains in a consolidation phase. A bullish flag may be forming and would be completed on a breakout above the weekly [Ichimoku] cloud near $31,900,"" analysts at technical analysis research provider Fairlead Strategies wrote in a note to clients on Monday.  A bull flag consists of a pole and a flag. The pole represents the initial price rally and the flag represents subsequent consolidation stemming from temporary exhaustion of bullish sentiment and the absence of strong selling pressure.  According to technical analysis theory, once an asset has broken through the flag, it tends to rally an amount roughly equal to the length of the pole. A breakout is confirmed once the upper end of the flag is breached.  In bitcoin's case, the move higher from the June 15 low of $24,770 to the June 23 high of $31,441 represents the pole, while the subsequent consolidation represents the flag.

Thailand becomes the second Southeast Asian nation to ban crypto staking activities for retail investors. Thailand Bans Lending and Staking Services The Thai SEC announced it is banning crypto exchanges from offering lending and staking services. On Monday, the securities agency issued new rules for digital asset service providers aiming to improve investor protection. According to the Thai SEC: It is forbidden to advertise or persuade the general public or do any other act in the manner of supporting the deposit staking & lending service. The regulator explained the ban applies to “depository services that offer returns to depositors and lenders,” meaning exchanges are outright banned from offering such services. The SEC’s new rules will take effect on July 31, 2023. Under the new rules, the SEC also introduced a mandatory trading risk disclaimer which exchanges must make clearly visible to customers. The risk disclaimer reads: Cryptocurrencies are high risk. Please study and understand the risks of cryptocurrencies thoroughly, because you may lose your entire investment. Further, the Thai SEC requires exchange operators to ensure users acknowledge trading risks before consenting to use such services. Finally, the SEC introduced investor suitability assessments to determine how much users may invest in crypto. Singapore Bans Lending and Staking for Retail Investors The Thai SEC’s ban follows an announcement from Singapore’s Monetary Authority (MAS) which also seeks to ban such services for retail investors. The regulator said in a statement on Monday that it determined staking activities are unsuitable for the retail public given the “extremely high risk and speculative nature” of those activities. The MAS said: Regulations alone cannot protect consumers from all losses, given the extremely high risk and speculative nature of digital payment token trading. In addition to the ban, the MAS will require crypto exchanges to safeguard customer assets in a trust before the end of the year. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) today announced new requirements for Digital Payment Token (DPT) service providers to safekeep customer assets under a statutory trust before the end of the year. This will mitigate the risk of loss or misuse of customers’ assets, and facilitate the recovery of customers’ assets in the event of a DPT service provider’s insolvency. Thailand and Singapore’s new investor protection rules come after the 2022 crypto lending crisis caused several firms to go bankrupt, costing investors billions of dollars.

14497427,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=541040,1688467850,USDC Circulating Supply Down 38% Since Jan. 1 – Will It Affect Price?,"USDC experienced a notable decrease in its circulating supply during the weekend, causing ripples of concern within the cryptocurrency market. According to data from CoinGecko, the stablecoin’s circulating supply dwindled by over 2%, falling from $27.9 billion on June 30 to $27.3 billion in less than 48 hours. This sudden drop has intensified existing worries regarding the stability and long-term viability of stablecoins in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. Since the beginning of the year, the total supply of USDC has exhibited a downward trajectory, plunging by a staggering 38%. This continuous decline raises questions about the underlying factors contributing to the diminishing supply of USDC and its potential impact on the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. Related Reading: Litecoin $100 Milestone Indicates Promising Bullish Trends – Here’s Why Declining Circulating Supply And Its Impact On USDC’s Price The decrease in USDC’s circulating supply can have significant implications for its price and overall value. As the supply of a stablecoin decreases, its scarcity may result in increased demand from investors and traders. If the demand for USDC remains steady or rises, the reduced supply could potentially push its price higher, following the basic principles of supply and demand economics. However, this effect may not be linear, as other factors such as market sentiment, regulatory developments, and the overall performance of the broader cryptocurrency market can also influence USDC’s price movements. USD Coin in red in all timeframes. Source: Coingecko Market Perception And Trust Concerns The declining circulating supply of USDC might also trigger questions regarding the underlying reasons behind the reduction. Investors and users may question the transparency and credibility of the stablecoin’s issuer or the overall health of its backing reserves. Any perceived lack of clarity or uncertainty could lead to reduced trust in USDC, causing some participants to seek alternative stablecoin options or even exit the market altogether. Consequently, the trustworthiness and regulatory compliance of stablecoin issuers will come under increased scrutiny, underscoring the need for greater transparency and accountability within the industry. As of today, the market cap of cryptocurrencies stood at $1.17 trillion. Chart: TradingView.com Regulatory Scrutiny The dwindling supply of USDC could also attract the attention of regulators and policymakers, who are increasingly keeping a close eye on the stablecoin space. Regulators have expressed concerns about the potential systemic risks associated with stablecoins, especially those with a significant market share. A decline in the circulating supply might amplify these concerns and prompt regulatory bodies to take more aggressive actions to oversee and regulate stablecoin operations. Increased regulatory scrutiny could introduce new compliance requirements, which may impact stablecoin issuers and the broader cryptocurrency market. Related Reading: PEPE Breaches Local Highs With 20% Leap In Surprise Comeback Notably in March, the stablecoin experienced a temporary detachment from its peg to the dollar, which occurred in the aftermath of multiple cryptocurrency bank failures. In response to potential liquidity challenges related to US Treasury bonds, the company behind USDC, Circle, took proactive measures. They made the strategic choice to shift their investment focus towards short-term maturity bonds. This decision was aimed at safeguarding the stablecoin’s value and addressing concerns about the stability of its backing reserves. (This site’s content should not be construed as investment advice.

A paltry return on savings When the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has to publicly shame the big UK banks because their pitiful easy-access savings rates for customers are between 0.7% to 1.35%, then you get an idea of how badly the banks are treating their clients. At a time when the Bank of England has only recently raised the base rate again from 4.5% to 5% there is absolutely no excuse for the banks to continue to give their customers such a paltry return on their cash. HSBC, Natwest, Barclays and Lloyds are the big 4 banks in question here, and according to Reuters, the top brass from these banks have been invited to the FCA on Thursday in order to discuss the issue. Reuters quoted a person familiar with the FCA’s position who said: ""We do think there is more value that can be provided to consumers, we are not happy with some of the lower savings rates we see, and we want banks to be supporting customers . . . and people to be able to make informed choices,"" With UK inflation staying at 8.7% for the second month in a row, consumers are up against it. Food inflation is around 30% and with the average 5-year fixed mortgage rate above 6% the UK economy is starting to scream. In this kind of environment, for the banks to be just looking out for themselves is grossly wrong. These are the banks that are judged as too big to fail, and will get bailed out/in if/when they get to the point of collapse. The question has to be asked: Why would anyone with any extra money put it into a bank? The official inflation rate of 8.5% is well over 10% if you take into account how items included in inflation are manipulated over the years. Therefore, to receive around 1% for savings that are losing around 10% a year does not make the slightest bit of sense. The only way the banks are able to get away with this is because people are just not informed as to how they can best deploy their savings. An alternative On that note, Bitcoin rose more than 100% since the beginning of the year. There is no guarantee that this will continue, and there is a lot of volatility in what is still a very tiny asset class. However, the investor has to make a choice between a fiat currency that will go to zero with 100% certainty, and Bitcoin, which is the scarcest and most secure asset in the world. Anybody who might think to make this choice should educate themselves fully on the matter. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

14492774,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=541013,1688460617,PEPE Breaches Local Highs With 20% Leap In Surprise Comeback,"PEPE has recently made a stunning comeback by surpassing its local highs with a remarkable 20% weekly surge. This unexpected turn of events have provided some relief to investors who thought the frog-themed coin will never be able to get back on its feet again. What has propelled this sudden comeback, and what does it signify for the future of this meme coin? Related Reading: Litecoin $100 Milestone Indicates Promising Bullish Trends – Here’s Why PEPE Maintains Bullish Pace As Open Interest Rises PEPE, currently priced at $0.00000185 according to CoinGecko, has recently experienced a remarkable surge in its value. Over the course of 24 hours, the asset witnessed a notable rally of 16%, and within the span of just seven days, it soared by an impressive 20%. Source: Coingecko Upon analyzing the OI (Open Interest) chart from Coinglass, it becomes evident that the surge in PEPE prices was accompanied by a simultaneous increase in Open Interest. This indicates that speculators in the Futures market were not only convinced of a bullish move but were also willing to bid on the asset, expressing their confidence in its potential. The Open Interest chart indicated that speculator sentiment continued to be robust. Source: Coinglass Furthermore, a PEPE price report revealed that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) displayed bullish momentum. Prior to the rally, PEPE came close to testing the 50% retracement level at $0.00000135. This observation suggests that the asset is likely to approach and potentially surpass the 23.6% and 61.8% extension levels at $0.000002 and $0.00000233, respectively. Such indications further fuel the optimism surrounding PEPE’s recent surge and raise questions about the asset’s future growth potential. BTC’s Role Remains Key The recent surge in PEPE, accompanied by positive indicators and price action, has bolstered expectations of continued gains for the asset. However, it is important to consider the potential impact of Bitcoin’s price movement, as a rejection from the $30.8k-zone could potentially shift market sentiment toward the sellers. The influence of Bitcoin, as the leading cryptocurrency, cannot be overlooked. Bitcoin often sets the tone for the overall cryptocurrency market sentiment. Bitcoin breaches the $31K territory. Chart: TradingView.com Should Bitcoin face a rejection near the $30.8k-zone, it could create a cautious atmosphere and shift sentiment toward sellers in the market. This scenario would likely impact PEPE and other altcoins, potentially hindering their upward momentum. Related Reading: Solana Firedancer: 15% Rally Fueled By Ongoing Network Improvements As traders and investors continue to monitor PEPE’s performance, keeping a close eye on the Bitcoin price movements becomes crucial.

14494334,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/07/ton-blockchain-introduces-on-chain-encrypted-messaging-feature,1688460600,TON Blockchain Introduces On-Chain Encrypted Messaging Feature,"The Open Network (TON) has announced the release of an on-chain encrypted messaging feature, allowing private messages between TON users. Previously, users could post on-chain messages. However, these were unencrypted and available to the public. Encrypted Transaction Messages The announcement was made on the 3rd of July by the TON Foundation. The TON blockchain network was forked from code that was created by the team behind the Telegram instant messaging app. However, the project was abandoned in 2020, but not before the team open-sourced TON’s code. This allowed others to pick up from where the original team left off. The current network was created by the TON Foundation, a non-profit organization that seeks to promote TON among developers and users. According to the TON Foundation, the network gives users far greater scalability and transaction throughput than other options available in the Web3 ecosystem while also offering a high level of decentralization. TON has always allowed users to send personalized messages when conducting transactions or sending NFTs to each other. However, these messages were completely public. With the introduction of the new feature, users can encrypt the messages end-to-end, meaning only the intended recipient will be able to view the message. The feature is a welcome addition to TON’s already highly secure platform. Furthermore, to increase the availability of the new service, the charge to send an encrypted message through the TON blockchain has been set at 0.006 Toncoin (TON) per transaction. Core developer at the TON Foundation, Anatoly Makosov, stated, “When sending Toncoin, Jettons, or NFTs on TON, you have always been able to include a text for the recipient such as ‘for coffee’ or ‘happy birthday,’ thereby personalizing the interaction. Now this popular feature [...] is available with full encryption.” He further added “Even in the event of an apocalypse and the failure of conventional messenger servers, you will retain the ability to send messages via the decentralized TON blockchain.” In such a scenario, TON could serve as a reliable and secure method of communication. TON Working Towards Accelerating Ecosystem The TON Foundation has been at the heart of rebuilding the TON ecosystem and attracting Web 3.0 developers and builders. In April 2022, TON users collectively donated $1 billion to the foundation and its efforts to advance the TON ecosystem. The donations in question were made over a ten-day window starting on the 7th of April, 2022. In total, around 527 million TON, equalling just over $1 billion, were donated by users, primarily TON whales. In May 2023, the TON Foundation enlisted the blockchain data platform Chainalysis with plans to utilize its Crypto Incident Response Service to provide round-the-clock support in the event of a hack or exploit. By partnering with Chainalysys, TON can access a robust and proven way to combat hacks or other unauthorized intrusions. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Tokens like pepe 2.0, floki 2.0, and bobo 2.0 – which were mostly issued in the past week and are passing themselves off as new versions of the popular pepe, floki and bobo tokens – have seen trading volumes jump to millions of dollars, attracted hundreds of thousands of dollars in liquidity and turned a few dollars to six-figure fortunes almost overnight.  Most of these do not last beyond a few weeks. Last year saw hopefuls bet on articles from the English language and the grimacecoin spurred by a McDonald's joke tweet.  Anyone can call a smart contract and issue tokens on Ethereum (or other blockchains) for a few cents, and the presence of decentralized exchanges means tokens can instantly be issued, supplied with liquidity and traded soon after.  As of Tuesday, pepe 2.0, seemingly the most popular of the clones, saw nearly $7 million worth traded in the previous 24 hours. It sported a market capitalization of $18 million, down from a peak of $45 million last week.  One wallet turned $900 of an initial pepe 2.0 purchase into over $176,000 in less than 24 hours. Analysis shows the wallet took profits on this position by selling in 2 ether (ETH) clips as the token rose.  On-chain analysis tool Bubblemaps has pointed out the centralized behavior of some early buyers who likely cornered a large part of the pepe 2.0 supply at launch and are gradually selling the tokens. That concentration may have contributed to the large price pump amid buying demand and significantly low sales from early buyers.  The real pepecoin (PEPE) is continuing to attract investors, with some large purchases extending gains of a nearly 80% rally over the past two weeks.  Data from Lookonchain shows two wallets purchased millions of the tokens on Monday as a niche part of the market bets on the frog-themed tokens flipping dogecoin (DOGE) and shiba inu (SHIB) – arguably the most popular meme coins – in the years to come.",POSITIVE,DOGE | ETH | SHIB,DOGE | ETH | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/04/pepecoin-knockoffs-turn-dollars-to-fortunes-in-strange-new-20-play,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/23a0e1279a0c1275a18673781581415b2c0dcb5b-3596x2023.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

About TRON DAO TRON DAO is a community-governed DAO dedicated to accelerating the decentralization of the internet via blockchain technology and dApps. Founded in September 2017 by H.E. Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of July 2023, it has over 170.5 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 6.05 billion total transactions, and over $12.74 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN.

Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency by market value, bottomed out near $15,500 in November and has since doubled to $31,000, with prices rising by nearly 20% in the past two weeks alone, thanks to the likes of Fidelity applying for spot-bitcoin ETF.  Wall Street's tech-heavy Nasdaq index also bottomed out in late 2022 and has rallied nearly 50% since then, with the broader index, S&P 500, gaining 25% over the same period.  The going could get tricky, as of late widely-tracked fiat liquidity metrics, like the Fed net liquidity indicator and the global net liquidity indicator, have turned lower, according to crypto fund Decentral Park Capital's Portfolio Manager Lewis Harland.  ""Market liquidity measures (global, U.S. domestic) point lower and would be unusual for BTC to be constructive with both liquidity measures declining over coming weeks,"" Harland said in a market update on Monday.  ""This is the single biggest reason we are cautious for BTC despite the bullish consensus market view and think this is being overlooked by investors,"" Harland added.  Fiat liquidity conditions heavily influence risk assets like bitcoin and stocks. Historically, turning points in fiat liquidity conditions have marked significant peaks and bottoms in risk assets' market valuations.  The global net liquidity indicator, which considers the fiat supply of several major economies, has dwindled to $26.5 trillion, the lowest since November 2022, according to data from the charting platform TradingView and Decentral Park Capital.  The Fed net liquidity indicator, which gauges the amount of U.S. dollars available in the system, has declined to $6 trillion from $6.3 trillion a few weeks ago.  Bank reserves held at the Federal Reserve (Fed) are also dropping, as tweeted by Sven Henrich, the founder and lead market strategist at NorthmanTrader, and Endeavour Equity Strategy's Founder, Douglas Orr.  Banks use reserves to extend credit. Hence, a decline in reserves means tightening and can lead to risk aversion.  The tweet shows the bank reserves held at the Fed have declined in the past coupe of weeks, putting a question mark on the sustainability of the S&P 500 rally. The same is true for bitcoin.  A similar divergence is seen in the MSCI All Country World Index (ACWI) and the total assets the big five central banks (the Fed, ECB, BOJ, PBOC and BOE), also a measure of fiat liquidity.  The combined balance of the big five central banks is contracting again, signaling liquidity pressures for risk assets.  ""We do see liquidity from central banks beginning to roll off, and that correlation with markets suggests that it may be a headwind moving forward. Particularly with [U.S.] Treasury issuance pulling more liquidity out of the market,"" pseudonymous macro trader and investors Markets & Mayhem said in Sunday's edition of the newsletter, noting the divergence between stocks and central bank balance sheets.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/04/traders-cautious-on-bitcoin-risk-assets-as-fiat-liquidity-measures-point-lower,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e9dc5b1b5912a919cf127b96ab0f412d6fccc5bb-1280x854.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

14493329,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/07/the-first-real-world-asset-product-stusdt-launches-on-the-tron-blockchain,1688458434,The First Real World Asset Product stUSDT Launches on the TRON Blockchain,"Geneva, Switzerland, July 4th, 2023, Chainwire Today, the TRON ecosystem welcomes its first Real World Asset (RWA) product, stUSDT, which is operating through the decentralized platform JustLend. TRON founder and member of Huobi's global advisory board, Justin Sun, has voiced his belief that stUSDT will evolve into the crypto version of Alipay’s Yu’e Bao, a money market fund product offered by Alibaba. Sun is convinced that it will serve as a bridge connecting traditional markets to blockchain ecosystems while empowering crypto users with more options. From July 10 to August 10, 2023, the stUSDT platform is set to launch a welcome campaign offering an increased APY of up to 10% (normally expected to be around 5%) to enhance users’ first experience with RWAs on TRON. Users can also enjoy discounts on redemption fees of stUSDT from July 3 to August 10. Please refer to Medium for daily updates on the RWA fund allocation and rebases. With a vast global user base and a $50 billion stablecoin market cap, stUSDT, a TRON-based RWA product, has sparked considerable industry excitement upon its introduction. It is primed to serve as a cornerstone for TRON's RWA endeavors and towards building a financial gateway that aims to empower 8 billion people worldwide. TRON's RWA product unleashes new opportunities Today, RWA is a popular concept in the crypto industry. The stUSDT platform is dedicated to narrowing the divide between retail and institutional investors while connecting the crypto realm with the real world. stUSDT ensures equal opportunities for all to invest in RWAs. This is the first endeavor in the TRON ecosystem to tokenize RWAs and introduce them to the community. stUSDT, the TRON ecosystem's answer to stETH on the Lido protocol, is a decentralized token that serves as proof of investment in RWAs and its holders can earn passive incomes from real world assets. stUSDT introduces more decentralized and robust asset management mechanisms. The ultimate goal of stUSDT is to optimize return opportunities for on-chain users from real world assets. Launched by RWA DAO, stUSDT is operated by JustLend DAO under the custody agreement between the two parties. JustLend DAO boasts the highest TVL on TRON and ranks among the top DeFi projects. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USDT (over $46 billion) and a TVL second only to Ethereum, which will also drive the organic growth of stUSDT. The stUSDT team is confident to see an influx of new users and wider expansion of the TRON ecosystem at large. Create the Web3 counterpart of Yu’e Bao, combining the physical world with Web3 Current market participants are consistently devoting time and effort to stay ahead of the curve regarding any new tech or product developments in the crypto sphere, and the sheer size of market expansion over the past few years speaks volumes. The inception of liquidity mining during the ""DeFi Summer"" of 2020 has given rise to a booming decentralized lending market. Back then, in the realm of USD-pegged stablecoins, a deposit rate of 10% was hardly a surprise. When the real world interest rates were low, liquidity gravitated towards on-chain DeFi lending markets. However, with a shift in market trends, some real world assets have now regained a much stronger position. For example, the US Fed Funds Rate has surged past 5%, making the dollar a sought-after risk-free asset. Under this latest macroeconomic backdrop, the DeFi sector has its eyes on RWAs in an attempt to venture into new markets. In traditional finance, Yu’e Bao, Alipay's money market fund product, has become a handy investment vehicle. The TRON-based stUSDT is positioned as the Yu’e Bao of Web3, whose debut unveils a new chapter for the TRON ecosystem to potentially replicate the success story of Alipay. Just as Alipay cracked the market open with its payment services before expanding its user base with Yu’e Bao, TRON has solidified its leading position in Web3 on-chain payment infrastructure across the globe, before the ecosystem ventures to new heights via the launch of stUSDT. Similar to Alipay’s Yu’e Bao, stUSDT enables users to engage with passive incomes and withdraw their assets at any time while enjoying the transparency, security, and immutability brought by blockchain technology. stUSDT provides a wide range of opportunities for users by connecting on-chain assets with real-world assets. Supported by TRON's robust ecosystem, the platform commits to a user-centric approach and serves as a dynamic bridge between traditional finance and blockchain. It is poised to attract a new mass of blockchain enthusiasts, further expanding the TRON DAO community. By further facilitating the integration of blockchain with traditional finance, stUSDT aims to propel the next stage of growth in the blockchain industry. About stUSDT The stUSDT.io platform is the first RWA platform on the TRON network, providing a secure and equitable channel for every blockchain user to engage with real world assets through decentralized smart contracts. Its goal is to establish a decentralized RWA investment and management mechanism, bringing real world assets into the TRON ecosystem. The platform token of stUSDT.io, stUSDT, is a decentralized token that serves as proof of investment in real world assets, enabling its holders to earn passive incomes.

14493150,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=541003,1688457938,Bullish On Bitcoin And Crypto: Why A Major Recession Crash Is Not Coming,"In the world of financial markets, Bitcoin and crypto, fear and uncertainty often dominate the headlines. Over the past few months, there has been growing speculation about an impending recession and the possibility of a major crash in risk assets. Theses such as Bitcoin will rise to $40,000 and then crash are currently in abundance. While the majority of analysts expect a recessionary crash, with the timing being hotly disputed, macro analyst Alex Krueger presents a compelling case for why such fears may be unfounded. In his research report, Krüger debunks prevalent bearish theses and sheds light on why he remains bullish on risk assets, including Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. 1/ A recession is imminent, risk assets are expensive, and stocks always bottom during deleveraging driven recessions. Is a major crash inevitable? Not at all In this research report we explore how prevalent bearish theses are flawed and why we are bullish on risk assets. pic.twitter.com/6b456Pvz2l — Alex Krüger (@krugermacro) July 3, 2023 Debunking Bearish Theses For Risk Assets Like Bitcoin According to Krüger, the upcoming recession, if any, has been one of the most widely anticipated in history. This anticipation has led to market participants and economic actors preparing themselves, thereby reducing the probability and potential magnitude of the recession. As Krüger astutely points out, “What truly matters is not if data comes in positive or negative, but if data comes in better or worse than what is priced in.” Related Reading: Why Bitcoin Dominance Hints At A Surprise Altcoin Season Ahead One flawed notion often associated with recessions is the belief that risk assets must bottom out when a recession occurs. Krüger highlights the limited sample size of US recessions and provides a counterexample from Germany, where the DAX has reached all-time highs despite the country being in a recession. This serves as a reminder that the relationship between recessions and risk assets is not as straightforward as some might assume. Valuations, another key aspect of market analysis, can be subjective and dependent on various factors. The analyst emphasizes that biases in data and timeframe selection can significantly impact valuations. While some metrics might suggest overvaluation, Krüger suggests looking closer at fair pricing indicators, such as the forward price-to-earnings ratio for the S&P 500 ex FAANG. By taking a nuanced approach, investors can gain a more accurate understanding of the market landscape. Furthermore, the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) presents a revolutionary opportunity. Krüger highlights the ongoing AI revolution, comparing it to the transformative power of the internet and industrial revolution. He notes that AI has the potential to replace a significant portion of current employment and boost productivity growth, ultimately driving global GDP higher. Krüger says, “Is an AI bubble forming? Likely so, and it is just getting started!” Related Reading: Bitcoin Sharks & Whales Show Strong Buying, Rally To Continue In July? Addressing concerns over liquidity, Krüger challenges the belief that liquidity alone drives risk asset prices. He argues that positioning, rates, growth, valuations, and expectations collectively play a more significant role. While the refilling of the Treasury General Account (TGA) has been currently viewed by a few analysts as a potential headwind for Bitcoin and crypto, Krüger points out that historical evidence suggests the TGA’s impact on the market has been minimal. He argues: The TGA is known to be decorrelated from risk assets for very long periods of time. In fact, the four largest TGA rebuilds over the last two decades have had a minimal impact on the market. The Best Is Yet To Come Considering the monetary policy landscape, Krüger notes that the tightening cycle by the US Federal Reserve is nearing its end. With the majority of rate hikes already behind us, the potential impact of a few additional hikes is unlikely to cause a significant shift. Krüger reassures investors that the Fed’s tightening cycle is nearly 90% complete, thus reducing the perceived risk of a crash in risk assets. Positioning is another factor that Krüger highlights as being cash-heavy, as indicated by record-high money market funds and institutional holdings. This suggests that a significant portion of market participants have adopted a cautious approach, which could serve as a buffer against any potential downside. Krüger states: According to the ICI, money market funds hit a record $5.4 trillion, while institutions hold $3.4 trillion as of June 28th, roughly 2% above the prior highest level on record, which happened in May 2020, the darkest point of the pandemic. All in all, Krüger’s analysis provides a refreshing perspective amidst a wave of bearish sentiment. While market conditions remain unpredictable, Krüger concludes: Everyone is bearish. But the recession has been front-run, AI revolution is real, the Fed is almost done, and the market is cash heavy. We see no reason for changing our bullish stance, which we’ve held for all of 2023. The trend is your friend. And the trend is up. At press time, the Bitcoin price was up 1.2% in the last 24 hours, trading at $31,050.

The pledge was made during a Twitter Spaces event held on the 3rd of July, with co-founder Kyle Davis calling the effort a “shadow recovery process.” Donating For Karma According to Davis, co-founder of Three Arrows Capital, it would be good karma to donate potential earnings from their new venture, Open Exchange (OPNX), to creditors of the bankrupt hedge fund. The plan would be separate from the already ongoing liquidation proceedings that are currently underway and trying to recover any value from the bankrupt company and redistribute it amongst its creditors. Davis also claimed that some creditors of 3AC had already been made whole. Global consulting firm Teneo is managing the recovery process. Davis called the process the first of its kind, claiming that it would allow himself and another co-founder Su Zhu to donate funds to creditors, but only if they were supportive of their new venture, Open Exchange. Davis stated, “If there are some that don’t want to deal with us, then they don’t have to. We very much believe that if we do good and we say to creditors who lost money, they have a way to make more back. If we do bad and they do well, then that’s great. And that’s good karma, or whatever you want to call it.” When asked how he could be working on a new venture while Three Arrows Capital was still dealing with the liquidation process, Davies stated that there was a connection between the new venture and Three Arrows Capital creditors, who only stood to benefit from their new entrepreneurial endeavor. Crypto Community Unimpressed The comments were not well received by the larger crypto community, which is still reeling from the collapse and counting its losses. A spokesperson for the Three Arrows Capital liquidator, Teneo, stated in response to Davies’ comments, “The founders of Three Arrows have willfully ignored multiple requests to assist with this process after initiating the liquidation themselves, and the court records paint a clear picture of the ways in which they have hindered creditor recoveries. Instead of promising creditors future earnings from a nascent venture, we would recommend that the founders engage in the court-ordered activities already underway.” The Controversial Open Exchange Davies and Su are currently working on OPNX and came under heavy criticism from the crypto community, who criticized them for coming up with a new venture while shirking their responsibilities to the creditors of 3AC. The Open Exchange is a trading platform that allows the trade of bankruptcy claims. The exchange has claimed on its website that there are currently 20 million users, with about $20 billion in claims. This comes after several other major players, such as FTX and Celsius, have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after the rout in crypto. Davies claimed in the Spaces session that OPNX is currently seeing around $50 million in daily trading volume. So far, only claims from Celsius are tradeable on the platform. However, the website states that claims in the bankruptcies of Voyager, Genesis, BlockFi, FTX, Hodlnaut, Vauld, Zipmex, Mt. Gox, and even Three Arrows Capital would be added soon. The 3AC Bankruptcy Three Arrows Capital filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection on the 1st of July, 2022. Court documents later revealed that the collapsed hedge fund owed around $2.8 billion to over 20 different firms. Both Davies and Su’s locations remain unknown, with creditors forced to use Twitter to serve them subpoenas. A report in the New York Times has claimed that both have been spending most of their time in Bali. On the 27th of June, creditors stated that they were looking to recover around $1.3 billion in lost funds from Davies. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

According to recent data posted by Curve DAO’s official Twitter page, the stablecoin has reached a supply and debt level of over $50 million, which indicates that the stablecoin is being used heavily just after two months after its launch. CRVUSD now joins the growing number of stablecoins available in the industry. However, another tense moment in the crypto market occurred last month. Some graphs pic.twitter.com/lHnNw6Cej1 — Curve Finance (@CurveFinance) July 1, 2023 Major Hiccup In The Stablecoin Industry Just last month, Tether’s USDT depegged, prompting serious fears of another collapse on the horizon. According to some sources, it was mostly caused by an imbalance within Curve DAO’s Curve 3Pool. This small imbalance caused a 70% surge in USDT’s balance which indicated a significant sell-off. Related Reading: Litecoin $100 Milestone Indicates Promising Bullish Trends – Here’s Why In an interview with Tether CTO Paolo Ardoino, he emphasized Tether’s role as “a gateway to liquidity” and how Tether is solid. He also puts confidence in USDT by saying that “these events are a good test for us.” Meanwhile, there is virtually no fear, uncertainty, or doubt surrounding CRVUSD, thanks to the ecosystem’s innovative utilization of LLAMMA—an exclusive algorithm designed specifically for CRVUSD. CRV market cap currently at $694 million. Chart: TradingView.com LLAMMA: How Does It Work? In a Twitter thread created by Poopman DeFi, LLAMMA uses a concept known as soft liquidation. The user must first deposit sfrxETH as collateral to borrow CRVUSD at an overcollatelrized ratio of 117%. LLAMMA then uses the price fluctuations of the two assets to rebalance the ratio between the two. crvUSD is the most hard-core stablecoin to ever exist. Instead of facing full liquidation when borrowing CDPs, crvUSD introduced LLAMMA 🦙, an algo that use soft liquidation to reduce impermanent loss during huge liquidation. A very in-depth thread on crvUSD by @CurveFinance🧵 pic.twitter.com/lnY5TJKV6V — Poopman 💩, 🌿- DeFi Rookie (@poopmandefi) July 2, 2023 The collateral is then spread over a band, which is basically a price range which the collateral will be spread upon. This reduces CRVUSD’s exposure to Ethereum while gaining the upside if ETH’s price pumps. According to recent sources, Frax Finance’s sfrxETH is currently the only supported collateral by the system with more assets to be onboarded in the future. CRV sustains 17.3% increase in the last week. Source: Coingecko Bulls Lead The Way, But Can They Sustain The Momentum? At the time of writing, CRV price was at $0.799, up nearly 5% in the last 24 hours. The token registered an impressive 17.3% rally in the last seven days, data from crypto market tracker Coingecko shows. CRV is currently facing resistance at the $0.817 price level. With its present momentum, we might see a bullish breakthrough next week or even earlier. Related Reading: Solana Firedancer: 15% Rally Fueled By Ongoing Network Improvements This will provide the bulls leverage for another price pump in the near future.

Detta innebär att spelare som har registrerat sig för Spelpaus fortfarande kan spela på dessa casinon. Det är viktigt att notera att detta kan vara riskabelt för spelare som har problem med spelberoende. Generell information om Spelpaus Spelpaus är ett verktyg som infördes av den svenska Spelinspektionen för att hjälpa spelare att kontrollera sitt spelande. Sedan dess har tusentals svenskar registrerat sig för tjänsten. Enligt Spelinspektionen har majoriteten av de som registrerat sig för Spelpaus valt att göra det på obestämd tid. Bör jag spela casinospel om jag har aktiverat Spelpaus? Detta är en mycket individuell fråga och beror på personens spelvanor. Om du har registrerat dig för Spelpaus på grund av problem med spelberoende, är det troligtvis inte en bra idé att spela på casinon utan spelpaus. Om du däremot känner att du har kontroll över ditt spelande och vill ha tillgång till ett större utbud av spel och bonusar, kan det vara ett alternativ för dig. Aktivera Spelpaus För att ansluta dig till Spelpaus, besök den officiella webbplatsen och följ instruktionerna. Du kommer att behöva ange några personuppgifter och välja hur länge du vill vara avstängd. Du kan välja att stänga av dig själv från spel för en viss period eller på obestämd tid. Är det möjligt med spelpaus hos utländska casinon? Ja, många utländska casinon erbjuder sin egen självavstängning. Dessa fungerar på liknande sätt som Spelpaus, men de är inte universella. Det innebär att om du stänger av dig själv från ett casino, kan du fortfarande spela på andra casinon som inte är en del av samma system. Vem bör använda spelpaus? Att spela på ett casino utan spelpaus kan vara lämpligt för dig om du har full kontroll över ditt spelande och är medveten om riskerna. Det är viktigt att komma ihåg att ett casino utan svensk licens inte är reglerat av den svenska Spelinspektionen, vilket innebär att de inte behöver följa samma strikta regler och regleringar. Vem kan spela utan spelpaus? Om du är en ansvarsfull spelare som har kontroll över ditt spelande, kan det vara lämpligt att spela på ett casino utan spelpaus. Dessa casinon kan erbjuda större bonusar och ett bredare utbud av spel, vilket kan förbättra din spelupplevelse. Vem ska undvika att spela på utländska casinon? Om du har problem med spelberoende eller har svårt att kontrollera ditt spelande, bör du välja casinon med svensk licens och undvika att spela på utländska casinosidor. Ett utlänskt casino med licens från någon annan myndighet är inte anslutet till Spelpaus, vilket innebär att du fortfarande kan spela även om du har registrerat dig för självavstängning i Sverige. Svenska spellagen och svensk spellicens Den svenska spellagen trädde i kraft 2019 och införde en rad strikta regler och regleringar för onlinecasinon. Dessa inkluderar begränsningar på bonusar, krav på att erbjuda spelare möjligheten att stänga av sig själva från spel och strikta regler för marknadsföring. Spelmarknadens reglering 2019 Regleringen av den svenska spelmarknaden 2019 innebar att alla onlinecasinon som vill erbjuda sina tjänster till svenska spelare måste ha en licens från den svenska Spelinspektionen. Denna licens kräver att casinon följer en rad strikta regler och regleringar för att skydda spelare. Ett casino utan licens i Sverige är alltså undantaget dessa regler, men följer istället de regleringar som gäller för den specifica licensen casinot har. Strikta regler för casino bonus och reklam En av de största förändringarna som infördes med den svenska spellagen var de strikta reglerna för bonusar och marknadsföring. Casinon med svensk licens får endast erbjuda en bonus till nya spelare, och denna bonus måste följa vissa regler. Dessutom är marknadsföring av spel strikt reglerad för att skydda spelare från vilseledande eller aggressiv reklam. Vad innebär 3-sekundersregeln? En annan viktig regel som infördes med den svenska spellagen är 3-sekundersregeln. Denna regel innebär att det måste gå minst tre sekunder mellan varje spelomgång på slots och liknande casinospel. Syftet med denna regel är att förhindra snabbspel, vilket kan leda till problem med spelberoende. Begränsat spel Casinon med svensk licens måste också erbjuda spelare möjligheten att sätta spelgränser. Dessa gränser kan vara dagliga, veckovisa eller månatliga och syftar till att hjälpa spelare att kontrollera sitt spelande. Även ett casino utan licens i Sverige har normalt dessa begränsningar om man väljer att aktivera funktionen. Är det olagligt att spela på casino utan svensk licens? Det är viktigt att notera att det inte är olagligt för svenskar att spela på casinon utan svensk licens. Även om dessa casinon inte är reglerade av den svenska Spelinspektionen, är det fortfarande lagligt för svenska spelare att registrera sig och spela på dem. Licenser för utlänska casinon Många casinon utan svensk spellicens har licenser från andra länder. De vanligaste av dessa är Malta, Curacao och Estland. Dessa licenser innebär att casinot är reglerat av den relevanta spelmyndigheten i det landet, men de behöver inte följa de svenska spelreglerna. Curacao eGaming Curacao är en annan populär spellicens för casinon utan svensk licens. Medan reglerna och regleringarna inte är lika strikta som för MGA, kräver en licens från Curacao fortfarande att casinon följer vissa standarder för rättvist spel och spelarskydd. Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) MGA är en av de mest respekterade spelmyndigheterna i världen. Casinon som har en licens från MGA måste följa en rad strikta regler och regleringar för att skydda spelare. Dessa inkluderar krav på rättvist spel, skydd av spelares personuppgifter och ansvarsfullt spelande. Estland Estland är en relativt ny spelmyndighet, men den har snabbt blivit populär bland casinon utan svensk licens. En licens från Estland innebär att casinot är reglerat av den estniska skatte- och tullstyrelsen, vilket ger spelare en viss nivå av skydd. Betygsättning av casinon utan spelpaus När vi betygsätter casinon utan spelpaus tar vi hänsyn till flera faktorer. Dessa inkluderar var casinot är licensierat, vilka betalningsalternativ det erbjuder, dess spelutbud, bonusar och erbjudanden, kundtjänst och mobiloptimering. Vilken licens har casinot? En av de viktigaste faktorerna när vi betygsätter ett casino utan spelpaus är var det är licensierat. Ett casino utan licens i Sverige måste ha licens från andra respekterade spelmyndigheter. Spellicens från Malta (MGA), Curacao, och Estland ger högre betyg än de med licenser från mindre strikta myndigheter. Betalningsmetoder och valutor Ett annat viktigt kriterium när vi betygsätter casinon utan spelpaus är vilka betalningsalternativ de erbjuder. Casinon som erbjuder en mängd olika betalningsmetoder, inklusive kredit- och betalkort, e-plånböcker och kryptovalutor, får naturligtvis högre betyg. Casinospel Spelutbudet är också en viktig faktor för ett casino utan licens i Sverige. Casinosidor som erbjuder ett brett utbud av spel, inklusive slots, bordsspel och live casino, får högre betyg. Vi tittar också på vilka spelleverantörer casinot samarbetar med, eftersom detta ger en bra indikation för kvaliteten och säkerheten i spelen. Bonusar och kampanjer Bonusar och erbjudanden är en annan viktig faktor. Casinon som erbjuder generösa välkomstbonusar och regelbundna kampanjer får högre betyg. Men vi tittar också på villkoren för dessa bonusar, eftersom vissa casinon kan ha orealistiska omsättningskrav. Kundsupport Kundtjänst är en annan viktig faktor när vi betygsätter casinon. Casinon som erbjuder snabb och hjälpsam kundtjänst, tillgänglig 24/7 och på svenska, får högre betyg. Spela på mobilen I dagens digitala värld är det viktigt att casinon fungerar bra på mobila enheter. Detta gäller naturligtvis även för ett casino utan licens i Sverige. Spelsidor som har en mobiloptimerad webbsida eller en app för iOS och Android får högre betyg. Steg för steg: Spela hos casinon utan svensk licens Att komma igång på ett online casino utomlands är oftast en enkel process. Först behöver du hitta ett casino som accepterar svenska spelare och som har en licens från en respekterad spelmyndighet. När du har hittat ett casino du gillar, behöver du bara registrera dig, göra en insättning och börja spela. Steg 1: Välj ett casino Det första steget är att välja ett casino att spela på. Det finns många casinon utan svensk licens att välja mellan, så det är viktigt att göra din forskning. I denna artikel har vi tagit fram förslag som kan vara hjälp, kolla in casinots spelutbud och bonusar, och se till att casinot har en licens från en betrodd spelmyndighet. Steg 2: Registrera ett konto När du har valt ett casino är nästa steg att registrera ett konto. Detta innebär vanligtvis att du fyller i några grundläggande uppgifter, som ditt namn, adress och e-postadress. Vissa casinon kan också be om en kopia av ditt pass eller annan ID för att verifiera din identitet. Steg 3: Gör en insättning När du har registrerat ett konto är nästa steg att göra en insättning. De flesta casinon utan svensk licens erbjuder en mängd olika betalningsmetoder, inklusive kredit- och betalkort, e-plånböcker och kryptovalutor. Välj den metod som passar dig bäst och följ instruktionerna på skärmen för att göra din insättning. Steg 4: Välj ett spel Nu när du har pengar på ditt konto är det dags att välja ett spel att spela. På ett typiskt casino utan svensk licens erbjuds ett brett utbud av spel, inklusive slots, bordsspel och live casino spel. Välj ett spel som intresserar dig och börja spela! Steg 5: Ta ut dina vinster Om du har tur och vinner kan du ta ut dina vinster. Detta görs vanligtvis genom samma betalningsmetod som du använde för att göra din insättning. Kom ihåg att vissa casinon kan ha minimi- och maximibelopp för uttag, och att det kan ta några dagar för pengarna att nå ditt konto. Bonus och erbjudanden utan svensk licens Casinon utan licens i Sverige kan ofta erbjuda större och mer generösa bonusar än ett casino med svensk licens. Detta regleras i svenska spellagen och syftar till att skydda spelare från att lockas till spel. Ett nätcasino utan svensk licens kan däremot obegränsat erbjuda massiva bonusar så som välkomstbonus, insättningsbonusar, free spins och lojalitetsprogram. Väljer man dessa bonusar är det viktigt att alltid läsa villkoren, eftersom att de i princip alltid har omsättningskrav och regler. Välkomstbonus Många nya casinon utan svensk licens ger generösa välkomstbonusar för att locka nya spelare. Till exempel kan ett casino utomlands erbjuda en 100% matchning upp till 2000 kr på din första insättning. Detta innebär att om du sätter in 2000 kr, kommer casinot att ge dig ytterligare 2000 kr att spela för, vilket ger dig totalt 4000 kr att spela med. Bonus utan insättningskrav (No deposit bonus) Vissa nätcasinon utan svensk licens erbjuder bonusar och free spins utan krav på insättning. Till exempel kan ett casino ge dig 20 free spins på en populär slots bara för att du registrerar dig, utan att du behöver sätta in några pengar. VIP-program & lojalitetsbonus Många online casinon har lojalitetsprogram där du samlar poäng för din aktivitet (insättning,spel, osv.). När du har samlat tillräckligt med poäng kan du byta in dem mot bonusar, free spins, kontanter eller andra belöningar. Till exempel kan ett casino utan svensk licens ge dig 1 poäng för varje 100 kr du satsar, och när du har samlat 1000 poäng kan du byta in dem mot 100 kr i bonuspengar. Cashback Cashback är en typ av bonus där casinot ger tillbaka en del av de pengar du har förlorat. Till exempel kan online casinon utan svensk spellicens erbjuda 10% cashback på alla dina förluster under en viss period. Om du förlorar 1000 kr under denna period, kommer casinot att ge tillbaka 100 kr till ditt konto. Maximera din bonus på casino utan svensk licens För att utnyttja utländska bonusar maximalt bör du alltid läsa villkoren noggrant. Se till att du förstår omsättningskraven och andra regler som gäller för bonusen. Här är några tips: Låga omsättningskrav (wagering requirements) Omsättningskrav är det belopp du behöver satsa innan du kan ta ut dina vinster från en bonus. Bonusar med låga omsättningskrav är oftast mer fördelaktiga. Hög Return To Player (RTP) RTP är en indikator på hur mycket ett casinospel betalar tillbaka till spelarna över tid. Spel med hög RTP kan öka dina chanser att omsätta din bonus och göra en vinst. Låt inte bonusvinsterna bli kvar på kontot När du har uppfyllt omsättningskraven för din bonus, bör du ta ut dina vinster så snabbt som möjligt. Detta för att undvika eventuella begränsningar eller avgifter som kan tillkomma om du låter dina vinster stå kvar på ditt konto för länge. Fördelar med casino utan svensk licens Det finns flera fördelar med att spela online casinon utan svensk licens. Här är de största fördelarna enligt svenska spelare: 👍 Större bonusar: Ett casino utan svensk licens är inte bundet av de svenska bonusreglerna, vilket innebär att de ofta kan erbjuda större och mer generösa bonusar till sina spelare. 👍 Ingen 3-sekundersregel: I Sverige måste det gå minst tre sekunder mellan varje spelomgång på ett online casino.

Betalningsmetoder på utländska casinon Utländska casinosajter erbjuder ofta en mängd olika betalningsalternativ som ett casino med svensk licens inte kan. Dessa kan inkludera traditionella metoder som kredit- och betalkort, samt digitala alternativ som e-plånböcker och kryptovalutor. BankID Vissa utländska casinon erbjuder betalningsmetoder med BankID. Detta innebär att du kan göra insättningar och uttag direkt från ditt bankkonto, vilket kan vara både snabbt och säkert. Zimpler Zimpler är en populär betalningsmetod på många casinon utan svensk licens. Det är en mobil betalningslösning som låter dig göra insättningar direkt från ditt bankkonto. Betalkort (VISA/MasterCard) De flesta casinon utan svensk licens accepterar betalkort som Visa och MasterCard. Detta är en enkel och bekväm betalningsmetod, men det kan tillkomma avgifter. E-wallets E-wallets som Skrill och Neteller är också populära bland de bästa casino utan svensk licens. Dessa tjänster låter dig göra transaktioner utan att behöva dela dina bankuppgifter med casinot. Kryptovalutor Vissa casinon utan svensk licens accepterar också kryptovalutor som Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, och Bitcoin Cash. Detta kan vara ett bra alternativ för spelare som värdesätter anonymitet och säkerhet. Säkerhet på casinon utan svensk licens Säkerheten är en viktig faktor att överväga när du spelar på ett casino utan svensk licens. För att försäkra dig om att spelsidan är säker kan du hålla koll på dessa punkter: Casinot bör ha spellicens Ett casino som har en licens från en respekterad spelmyndighet, som MGA eller Estland, är oftast säkert att spela på. Dessa myndigheter kräver att casinon följer strikta regler och regleringar för att skydda spelare. SSL-kryptering SSL-kryptering är en teknik som skyddar din personliga information när den överförs över internet. Casinon som använder SSL-kryptering skyddar dina uppgifter från att bli stulna av hackare. Kända betalningsmetoder och speltillverkare Ett annat tecken på ett säkert casino är att det samarbetar med seriösa spel- och betalningsmetoder. Dessa företag har ett rykte att upprätthålla och skulle inte samarbeta med oseriösa casinon.

Dessa kan inkludera allt från skraplotter och keno till bingo och virtuell sport. Dessa spel kan erbjuda en trevlig paus från de mer traditionella casinospelen och ger spelare chansen att prova något nytt och annorlunda. Crash Games (Aviator spel) Crash Games är en relativt ny typ av spel som har blivit populära på vissa spelsidor. I ett Crash Game gör spelare en insats och en multiplikator (som representerar en “kurs”) börjar stiga från 1x uppåt.

KYC (Know Your Customer) En del casinosidor kräver att du genomgår en KYC-process. Detta innebär att du behöver verifiera din identitet genom att skicka in vissa dokument. Detta är ett krav från spelmyndigheterna för att förhindra penningtvätt och bedrägeri. Vad kommer att hända med sveriges spelmarknad? Framtiden för den svenska casinomarknaden är osäker. Medan den svenska spellagen har infört strikta regler och regleringar för att skydda spelare, har den också lett till att vissa spelare och spelbolag söker alternativ utanför Sverige. Detta kan leda till att den svenska marknaden blir mindre attraktiv för både spelare och spelbolag i långa loppet. För att göra den svenska marknaden mer attraktiv kan det vara nödvändigt att lätta på vissa av de strikta reglerna och regleringarna. Detta kan inkludera att tillåta större bonusar, att ta bort femsekundersregeln och att erbjuda mer flexibla spelgränser. Frågan om Sverige bör lätta på reglerna är omdiskuterad. Medan vissa menar att de nuvarande reglerna är för strikta och begränsande, menar andra att de är nödvändiga för att skydda spelare och förhindra problem med spelberoende. Kan man som svensk stoppas från utländska casinon? Det är mycket svårt, om inte omöjligt, för svenska myndigheter att stoppa svenskar från att besöka ett casino utan svensk licens. De kan möjligtvis blockera tillgången till vissa webbplatser och begränsa betalningsmetoder, men i slutändan kan de inte förhindra spelare från att hitta och använda alternativa metoder för att få tillgång till dessa casinon. Stoppade banktransaktioner Betalningsblockeringar är en metod som svenska myndigheter kan använda för att försöka stoppa svenskar från att spela på casinon utan svensk licens. Detta innebär att de kan försöka förhindra transaktioner mellan svenska banker och casinon utomlands. Men det finns ofta sätt att kringgå dessa blockeringar, till exempel genom att använda e-plånböcker eller kryptovalutor.

The Nasdaq exchange has submitted an amended application for a Bitcoin spot ETF on behalf of BlackRock after the SEC found trouble with its initial attempt. Nasdaq Names Coinbase as Surveillance Partner In the newly submitted application, Nasdaq reached an agreement with crypto exchange Coinbase to enter into a surveillance-sharing agreement which will address one of the SEC’s main objections to recent Bitcoin spot ETF filings. The filing reads: The Spot BTC SSA is expected to be a bilateral surveillance-sharing agreement between Nasdaq and Coinbase that is intended to supplement the exchange’s market surveillance program. The Wall Street Journal reported last week that the SEC told Nasdaq and Cboe that recent ETF filings from BlackRock, Fidelity, and others were not “clear and comprehensive.” Senior Bloomberg Analyst Eric Balchunas soon tweeted that the SEC’s main objection to the filings was that it needed the name of the crypto exchange for the “surveillance-sharing agreement” and required more details on the SSA. Hold up a second, this isn't as bad as headline. The key paragraph is deep in story. Basically SEC wants them to name the ""crypto exchange"" and give more details on SSA. That's understandable, arguably good news. I was under impression they'd have to update that as well. pic.twitter.com/bh9qn65Xh2 — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) June 30, 2023 Firms Update ETF Filings BlackRock’s proposed ETF will depend on Coinbase as its custodian and for its spot market data for pricing.

BlackRock was the first to apply for a Bitcoin spot ETF on June 15, followed by filings from WisdomTree, Invesco, and finally, Fidelity.

The cryptocurrency has been experiencing a substantial price increase over the past 24 hours. According to CoinGecko data, FIL has increased in value by 16.47% in the past day, propelling its price to $4.73. FIL is the native token of the decentralized Filecoin network, an open-source cloud storage protocol designed for easy data storage and retrieval. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Leads With Highest Number of Fake Twitter Followers, Data Reveals Filecoin In June – Price Action The FIL price started the month trading at $4.693. The token’s value dipped after touching the $5 price level, losing as much as 34% before June 10. However, the FIL price has steadily risen since this sharp decline, gaining more than 52% in the past few weeks. It is worth noting that Filecoin moved sideways towards the end of June, with the token’s price hovering around $4. That said, FIL appears to have resumed its bullish course, having soared more than 20% since the beginning of July. Most of this price increase is due to today’s spike, which has pushed Filecoin to reclaim its price level seen in early June. As of this writing, Filecoin (FIL) changes hands at $4.73, according to data from CoinGecko. The cryptocurrency has a 24-hour trading volume of over $530 million, representing a 434% surge in the past day. The recent price upswing of Filecoin (FIL) has also positively impacted its market capitalization, with a market cap of more than $2 billion USD. What’s Next For FIL? It remains to be seen how long this current price rally will last, especially as the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) nears the overbought zone. The RSI is a momentum indicator that tracks a token’s oversold and overbought levels. When the RSI enters the oversold region, it signals that the token’s price is losing momentum, and a reversal might be on the horizon. Additionally, Filecoin is at the key resistance level of $4.8 on the daily timeframe. If FIL breaks this threshold, the token is expected to continue its bullish run, leading to further price appreciation. On the flip side, if FIL fails to break the $4.8 resistance level, we could see the coin fall to the $2.941 support level. Meanwhile, the 200 EMA (Exponential Moving Average) also acts as a dynamic resistance for the Filecoin price, posing a barrier to upward movement, as seen on the chart below. Hence, the bullish run may not continue until the price of FIL moves above the 200 EMA.

In the past 24 hours, the altcoin saw a 1.8% increase. However, on the weekly chart, it has retraced all its gains due to the lack of significant movement within the range. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Leads With Highest Number of Fake Twitter Followers, Data Reveals AVAX is struggling to surpass the $14 level, which has historically acted as a significant resistance. If AVAX manages to break above this resistance level, a rally is possible. However, the price movement of AVAX is closely tied to Bitcoin’s performance, as other altcoins have exhibited similar patterns. If Bitcoin drops to the $31,000 range, AVAX might find surpassing the $14 mark challenging. From a technical perspective, the outlook for AVAX favors the bulls, but the momentum is not particularly strong. Demand and accumulation indicators suggest that buying strength is slowly increasing. The market capitalization of AVAX has seen growth, which is a positive sign. However, if Bitcoin starts retracing on its chart, AVAX could turn bearish. Avalanche Price Analysis: One-Day Chart As of the time of writing, AVAX was trading at $13.30. The altcoin recently formed a lower high at this level, indicating a resistance point. The immediate resistance level for AVAX is slightly higher at $13.90. The price needs to break above this resistance to initiate a rally and surpass the $14 mark. However, before reaching $13.90, AVAX might encounter another resistance level of around $13.40. The coin must sustain trading above these levels for a considerable period to gain significant upward momentum. On the downside, support is seen at $13. If the price falls below this support level, it may decline to $12.80, invalidating the bullish scenario. Technical Analysis Following the bounce from the $13 support level, AVAX has seen an increase in buying interest. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is slightly above the 50-mark, suggesting that sellers have temporarily retreated and buyers are gaining control. Additionally, AVAX has moved above the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line, indicating a return of demand and that buyers are currently driving the price momentum in the market. AVAX has shown continued buying strength, with buy signals forming on the daily chart. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), which measures price momentum and shifts, has displayed green histograms associated with bullish signals.

On the other hand, MATIC is steady, in an uptrend, adding 6.3% in the last trading week. Polygon had a market capitalization of $6.5 billion when writing on July 3. The cryptocurrencies that Revolut intends to delist have high liquidity and can be traded on major global exchanges such as Binance and KuCoin, even at their current valuations. In an email, Revolut said clients in the United States would be barred from trading the three tokens and have to sell their assets by September 18. Specifically, Revolut cited shifting laws around cryptocurrencies in the United States. The email read in part: Our US crypto services provider has decided to delist these tokens due to the changing laws and regulations around cryptocurrency in the US. Because of this, we’ll no longer be able to process your buy and sell orders for these tokens. SEC Alleges ADA, SOL, And MATIC Are Unregistered Securities While the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) cited SOL, ADA, MATIC, and other coins, including Algorand (ALGO), as examples of unregistered securities, forcing several providers in the country to remove them from their platforms. Revolut also appears to be following in the steps of Baktt, a digital asset platform founded by Intercontinental Exchange (ICE). Days after the SEC’s comments, the platform said they would stop supporting the three coins mid-June. Related Reading: Maker (MKR) Gains 30% In 7 Days, What’s Next?

On Monday, Winklevoss posted to Twitter an ""Open Letter to Barry Silbert,"" the founder of Digital Currency Group (DCG), which owns Genesis as well as the giant crypto asset manager Grayscale. (CoinDesk is also a holding.)  In the letter, Winklevoss bemoaned delays on the part of DCG to come up with a satisfactory plan to repay Genesis creditors, including customers of Gemini's Earn program. DCG also has missed a payment of $630 million to Genesis.  Winklevoss tweeted a document titled ""Best and Final Offer - July 3, 2023,"" with the outlines of a plan that calls for $1.465 billion of payments and loans denominated in dollars, bitcoin and ether. The deadline to agree to the deal is 4 p.m. on July 6, according to the letter.  ""I write to inform you that your games are over,"" Winklevoss wrote in the letter. ""In addition to dragging out a resolution, they have ballooned professional fees to over $100 million, all of which have gone to lawyers and advisors at the expense of creditors and Earn users.""  In a January court filing, Genesis had listed more than $3 billion in claims to its top 50 creditors. According to Winklevoss, some $1.2 billion is owed to Earn users.  Efforts to reach DCG for comment were not immediately successful.  In the letter, Winklevoss wrote that the consequences of failing to agree to ""this deal"" by the deadline could include lawsuits against DCG and Silbert personally, as well as pushing to put DCG into default and working on a ""non-consensual"" debt-repayment plan.

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: The market is optimistic that re-filed bitcoin ETF applications have legs.  Insights: Crypto majors are up in a big way during the first half of 2023 as the market repairs the damage from last year's catastrophes.

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Bitcoin Crosses $31K After Bitcoin ETF Issuers Begin Refiling  Happy Fourth of July.  While many parts of the U.S. are off for an extended long weekend, market action has been tame.  Bitcoin began the Tuesday business day in Asia past the $31,000 mark at $31,153 as the world’s largest digital asset rallied on Monday after a few prospective bitcoin ETF issuers re-filed their applications.  “Enthusiasm for bitcoin is growing, propelled by efforts to revive spot bitcoin ETF applications,” Rachel Lin, CEO and co-founder of SynFutures, told CoinDesk in a note. “Its commanding presence in the crypto market is increasingly evident, making up nearly half of the industry's $1.2 trillion market cap, the most dominant it's been in over two years.”  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) is up 18 points to 1,318.  Meanwhile, prices of NFTs seem to be becoming disconnected from the price of ether as trading volume plummets.  The Bored Ape Yacht Club's NFT collection hit a new low since October 2021 with a floor price dropping below 30 ETH ($58,700), an effective halving since April, reflecting a broader slump in the NFT market. But considering ether’s continued performance, there seems to be more confidence in the protocol than this use case.  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Polygon MATIC +4.8% Smart Contract Platform Cosmos ATOM +3.7% Smart Contract Platform Terra LUNA +3.0% Smart Contract Platform  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Polkadot DOT −1.4% Smart Contract Platform Stellar XLM −1.3% Smart Contract Platform Solana SOL −1.0% Smart Contract Platform  Insights  Last year was a rough year for crypto, a saga that began with rising interest rates, and continued through the year with the crash of Do Kwon’s LUNA, Three Arrows Capital’s collapse, and finally, FTX.  Data from Messari shows that 2023 has fared much better.  During the first half of the year, crypto majors – meaning the 43 tokens with a market cap of over $1 billion – were up an average of 34%. In comparison, this same group of tokens declined an average of 56% for the same period last year.  So far this year, bitcoin is up 84.6% compared to a falloff of nearly 60% for the first half of 2022.  But of all the major assets, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) performed the best, up a whopping 203% so far this year. As CoinDesk has previously reported, technical improvements to the protocol and the introduction of a framework that would allow for the development of dApps has likely pushed up investor interest in the asset class.  Other stand-out performers for the period include liquid staking platform Lido DAO (LDO), which rallied in February on comments from U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chair Gary Gensler’s about a staking ban and then on the shuttering of Kraken’s staking service.  Solana is also up 93% during the first half of the year, raising prospects for the layer-1 protocol, whose total value soared at the height of the 2021 bull market but then plummeted with the rest of crypto during 2022’s dark days.

This development implies a surge in market interest for Shiba Inu, despite its challenges during the same period, the report suggested. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Leads With Highest Number of Fake Twitter Followers, Data Reveals Substantial Growth Amid Challenges Shiba Inu’s performance in the second quarter might initially seem contradictory. While the meme coin faced several adversities, on-chain data hints at a noticeable resurgence of interest in the market.

Quarterly Update: #SHIB had a strong ending to Q2, with new addresses showing positive signs of growth. Daily new addresses reached over 4k on June 27th, up 357% from it 877 quarterly low on May 21st. pic.twitter.com/jbhlR8OUvl — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) July 3, 2023 The data points towards more than 4,000 new addresses recorded for SHIB on June 27, a landmark achievement for the digital asset. The number signifies roughly a 357% increase from the quarterly low of 877 new addresses seen on May 21. This sharp rise suggests an expansion in the Shiba Inu user base and heightened engagement from traders and investors in the Shiba Inu ecosystem. Peak In Daily Active Addresses Alongside an influx of new addresses, Q2 also saw a notable surge in daily active addresses for Shiba Inu. Data analytics provider Santiment revealed an escalation of 24-hour active addresses for SHIB. On June 11, the figure surged to a high of 42,822. This is the most substantial daily active address count the digital asset has seen in over a year.

14480610,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=540983,1688429965,Why Bitcoin Dominance Hints At A Surprise Altcoin Season Ahead,"Over the last month, a coordinated attack against altcoins by the US SEC caused Bitcoin dominance to surpass 50%. Above the psychological level makes BTC more valuable as a whole than the entire crypto market. However, a technical signal has appeared that in the past put in a peak in BTC.D and suddenly sparked a reversal in altcoins. Here is a closer look at the signal and why a surprise alt season could be right around the corner. Bitcoin Dominance Beats All Other Crypto Combined Bitcoin dominance is a metric that measures the top cryptocurrency’s market cap against the weight of everything else in the space. It is often used as a barometer of health in altcoins, specifically when it’s better to be in BTC, or in alts like Ethereum, Litecoin, or Solana. When BTC.D is falling and the market is healthy, altcoins outperform Bitcoin in terms of alpha. But as high beta assets, alts are significantly more volatile. As a result, when the market is crashing, they suffer much more drawdown by comparison and BTC’s market share becomes increasingly dominant. Related Reading: Bitcoin Starts To Bite Back Says Reptilian Technical Signal This is precisely the case all throughout 2023. Altcoins have taken a beating, but Bitcoin has held its ground. This divergence across the different types of cryptocurrencies has caused the total market cap of BTC to surpass all other coins combined. 50% dominance is clearly an important level. However, it’s a reading on the Relative Strength Index that’s particularly notable. Will dominance be rejected? | BTCUSD on TradingView.com The BTC.D Signal Hinting At A Surprise Altcoin Season The Relative Strength Index is a momentum measuring tool, which tells traders when an asset is overbought or oversold. In crypto, assets can stay overbought or oversold for extended periods of time. But in BTC.D, on weekly timeframes, historically it hasn’t spent much time at overbought conditions. In fact, it has only reached overbought a handful of times. This latest push into overbought territory has reached a reading that in the past put the peak in for Bitcoin dominance and immediately turned around into an epic altcoin season. This setup last appeared in late 2019 when BTC.D was at 70%. Related Reading: Bitcoin Reaches Longest Stretch Ever Without A Bull Run With such overbought conditions, combined with an Elliott Wave count indicative of a five-wave move coming to an end, an altcoin season might not be as far away as most are expecting. Although altcoins outperform in an alt season, hence the name, they require a bullish Bitcoin to bait retail to the market. With BTC beginning to show bullish signs once again, how long until altcoins follow and ultimately outperform? This chart originally appeared in Issue #10 of CoinChartist (VIP).
