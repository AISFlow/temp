29530085,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=624805,1718492435,"Bernstein Analysts Revise Bitcoin Target, $200,000 And $1 Million Become Main Focus","Bernstein analysts Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra recently revised their price targets for Bitcoin in their latest market report, which also initiated coverage on MicroStrategy. These analysts also outlined factors that they believe could contribute to BTC’s exponential price surge. Bitcoin To Hit $200,000 And Then $1 Million Chhugani and Sapra predicted in the report that BTC will rise to a cycle high of $200,000 by 2025 and that the flagship crypto will reach $1 million by 2033. Bernstein had previously predicted that Bitcoin would reach $150,000 by 2025. However, these analysts have now revised their targets and alluded to the institutional demand for BTC as one of the reasons they believe the flagship crypto can reach such heights. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Lists The Cardano Developments That Will Drive ADA Price To $3 In 2024 The research firm predicts that the Spot Bitcoin ETFs will continue to record impressive demand and that the Bitcoin under management could reach $190 billion by 2025, a significant increase from the $60 billion in BTC that funds issuers already have under management. In other words, these analysts expect BTC’s price to succumb to the supply and demand dynamics, considering that the Bitcoin in circulation is bound to drastically reduce as these Spot Bitcoin ETFs continue to accumulate a significant amount of the crypto token for their respective ETFs. Moreover, two Bitcoin halvings are set to occur before 2033, further reducing miners’ supply and thereby supporting their base case of BTC hitting $1 million. MicroStrategy To Benefit From BTC’s Growth These Berstein analysts also initiated coverage on MicroStrategy with an outperform rating. They predict that the software company’s stock can rise to $2,890 thanks to its BTC exposure. A rise to $2,890 represents about a 95% increase for MicroStrategy’s stock, which is currently valued at around $1,500. The research firm noted that MicroStrategy has committed itself to “building the world’s largest Bitcoin company.” This has already paid off so far, with Chhugani and Sapra stating that the software company has transformed from a “small software company to the largest BTC holding company” since August 2020 (when it started accumulating BTC). MicroStrategy already owns 1.1% of Bitcoin’s total supply, with holdings worth around $14.5 billion. The company’s BTC holdings are expected to increase soon enough, as they recently announced plans to offer $500 million of Convertible Senior Notes. Some of the proceeds from the proposed sale will be used to buy additional BTC. Related Reading: Ethereum Withdrawals From Coinbase Top $1.2 Billion, What’s Going On? Berstein highlighted how the company’s co-founder Michael Saylor has become synonymous with the Bitcoin brand and that the company’s position as the leading Bitcoin company has helped attract “at scale capital (both debt and equity) for an active Bitcoin acquisition strategy.” In dollar terms, Bernstein noted that MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin net asset value (NAV) per share “has grown nearly fourfold, surpassing the 2.4x growth in Bitcoin’s spot price.” “We believe MSTR’s long term convertible debt strategy allows it enough time to gain from Bitcoin upside, with limited liquidation risk to its Bitcoin on balance sheet.” Chhugani and Sapra added.

This comes amidst the bearish sentiment in the crypto market, which has also caused Solana’s price to decline. Solana Whales Move Over $500 Million Worth Of SOL In Several Transactions On-chain data shows that Solana whales have conducted six large transactions in the last 24 hours. The first transaction involved the transfer of over 1.5 million SOL tokens ($216 million) to an unknown wallet (HCC…wmr). This wallet then sent 1.13 million SOL tokens ($163 million) to four different unknown wallets, with this unknown wallet (Auj…yhS) a majority of the transferred funds (1 million SOL tokens). Related Reading: Ethereum Withdrawals From Coinbase Top $1.2 Billion, What’s Going On? The third transaction involved the transfer of just over 1 million Solana tokens ($144 million) from an unknown wallet (GYj…gG6) to another unknown wallet (4Ax…TAh). This wallet then transferred the tokens to another unknown wallet (3vx…kom). The fifth transaction still involved the unknown wallet (3vx…kom), which moved 1.6 million Solana tokens ($230 million) to another unknown wallet (FnH…Arr). This unknown wallet then transferred the received tokens to a Coinbase-linked wallet. This transaction suggests that the Solana whale may be looking to offload their tokens, which would negatively impact Solana’s price. However, the earlier transactions indicate that the other Solana whales may just be rotating their capital between wallets rather than offloading them on the market. This is also feasible considering that there has been a lot of activity on the Solana network, with traders actively trading due to the ongoing meme coin frenzy. Data from DappRader shows that the transaction volume on the network has continued to soar despite SOL’s declining price. What Next For SOL’s Price Crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently mentioned that Solana is set for a “major 53% price move.” He added that the market should keep an eye on the $143 support and $178 resistance levels to gauge sentiment on the crypto token. Crypto analyst Jelle seems to have a bearish sentiment toward SOL. He recently revealed that Solana has failed to repeat a similar pattern from earlier in the year and has now lost the $150 support level. He stated that he wouldn’t be surprised if Solana dropped to as low as $140. Crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa also revealed his bearish sentiment for SOL, stating that the current celeb meta isn’t “healthy” for the crypto token’s ecosystem. He added that Solana’s chart looks “pretty scary” and that Ethereum will probably continue outperforming it for this next stretch. Related Reading: Dogecoin Sees Monumental Surge In Transactions As Whales Spend $129 Million Altcoin Sherpa also discussed the possibility of Solana dropping to as low as $120 while analyzing its USDT pair. He stated that he wouldn’t invest in Solana until it dropped to $140 and that he might just continue to wait until it fell to around $120. In the long term, the crypto analyst is still bullish on Solana and expects it to rise above $500 this year.

DeFiLlama is an aggregator that tracks the crypto sector's total value locked - or the total U.S. dollar value of digital assets locked, or staked, on a particular blockchain network via decentralized finance platforms. According to the data , since 2014, crypto startups have seen a total of 5,287 funding rounds that have raised in total $101.36B. October 2021 was the best month in this time period, with over $7B raised. Earlier this year, crypto industry news and research outlet The Block said the total, all-time dollar amount invested into crypto and blockchain-related companies exceeded $90B in February. The firm cited funding data for startups that it tracked since 2017. The $100B milestone comes a few months after the crypto industry received a shot in the arm from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) long-awaited approval of spot bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) exchange-traded products in January. Not long after, bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) surged to a record high north of $73,000 in March, though it has since retreated after its last halving on April 19, 2024. Halving events reduce the rate at which new coins are created and thus lower the available amount of new supply. For investors that want to track bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) focused funds, here are some names to look at: ( IBIT ), ( GBTC ), ( FBTC ), ( ARKB ), ( BITB ), ( HODL ), ( BRRR ), ( BTCO ), ( EZBC ), and ( BTCW ).

However, prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez has released a price alert indicating that the market leader could be set for more losses if it fails to secure a certain support zone. Related Reading: Bitcoin Crashes To $65,000, Expert Unpacks Drivers Of Crypto Market Bloodbath Bitcoin URPD Chart Shows Potential Correction – Analyst In an X post on June 15, Martinez stated that Bitcoin needs to quickly rise above $66,254 else it risks a potential decline to around the $61,100 price mark. Martinez based his theory on the UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) chart generated by the data analytics platform Glassnode. #Bitcoin needs to climb back above $66,254 quickly to avoid a potential correction down to $61,100! pic.twitter.com/WMr7jcAVJU — Ali (@ali_charts) June 14, 2024 For context, an unspent transaction output (UTXO) refers to units of Bitcoin that are unspent after a transaction. Each UTXO has a realized price i.e. the price the market price at the time of UTXO was transacted. In a UTXO Realized Price Distribution chart, Bitcoin’s supply is broken down based on the realized prices of UXTOs showing how much BTC was acquired at different levels. This data can be used to study market sentiment, distribution analysis as well as support and resistance levels. More importantly, investor behavior can also be studied as a high concentration of UTXOs indicates levels at which most investors bought Bitcoin which can translate into a potential resistance or support level. According to the URPD chart shared by Martinez, 504,619 BTC was purchased at $66,254 thus indicating a strong potential to serve as a support for Bitcoin amidst its current downtrend. Furthermore, the next realized price with the highest number of Bitcoin (191,366) bought is $61,101 representing the next support level should the premier cryptocurrency fail to reclaim the $66,254 price mark.

According to Coincodex, the general sentiment is bearish nevertheless, the fear and greed index stands at 74 which indicates current optimism as well as risk-taking behavior among investors which highlights a potential for high market volatility.

He added that anything is possible but that is the timeline they are working with for now. These Bloomberg analysts had previously put July 4th as their over/under date for the launch of the Spot Ethereum ETFs. Balchunas acknowledged that the recent shift from July 4th to 2nd wasn’t a major one but was still significant, considering it was beginning to feel like it could take longer before the Spot Ethereum ETFs launch. He also clarified that they decided on July 2nd as the over/under date because this is when they remain undecided about whether to go lower or higher. Their latest projection is also good news, considering that SEC Chair Gary Gensler had thrown the crypto community into a bit of limbo with his latest comment. While addressing the Senate Banking Committee on June 13, Gensler told Senator Bill Hagerty that the S-1 filings for the Spot Ethereum ETFs will likely be approved “over the course of this summer.” This statement raised the possibility of these funds not being approved until the end of the summer, which will be sometime in September. Spot ETFs To Propel ETH To $10,000 The Spot Ethereum ETFs are expected to have a huge impact on Ethereum’s price once they begin trading. Crypto expert Ash Crypto recently mentioned that Ethereum reaching $10,000 is just a “matter of time,” with these funds set to start trading soon. Crypto analyst Eljaboom also alluded to the Spot Ethereum ETFs when he stated that $10,000 is “programmed” for Ethereum in this cycle.

This whale, with a seemingly bottomless appetite for XRP, has scooped up nearly 27 million coins, sparking speculation of a potential price surge. However, the broader market sentiment remains murky, leaving investors to navigate a sea of conflicting signals. Related Reading: NEAR Protocol: From Recent Dip To Google Search Darling – Is $16 Next? XRP Whales Bet Big On Coin’s Future The on-chain transaction tracker, Whale Alert, reported a significant purchase by a known XRP whale. This investor, identified by a cryptic wallet address, gobbled up 27.74 million XRP from cryptocurrency exchange Binance. This hefty purchase, valued at roughly $13 million, adds to a growing collection by the same whale, who has been accumulating XRP throughout recent price dips. This aggressive buying behavior is often interpreted as a bullish sign. Whales, with their vast resources, are seen as having a keen understanding of the market and a long-term view. Their willingness to invest heavily in XRP, even during a bearish period, suggests confidence in the asset’s potential for future growth. Technical Indicators Paint A Sunny Picture Adding fuel to the optimistic fire is a recent technical analysis predicting a 20% price increase for XRP by July 15th. This forecast, while not a guarantee, provides a glimmer of hope for investors seeking a return on their XRP holdings. Additionally, XRP has displayed relative stability compared to other cryptocurrencies, experiencing a low price volatility and a high percentage of positive days over the past month. However, a closer look reveals some storm clouds on the horizon. The Fear & Greed Index, a measure of investor sentiment, currently sits at a concerning “extreme greed.” This suggests the market might be overbought, potentially leading to a correction as investors cash out their profits. XRP: On Legal Battles And Conflicting Market Signals Furthermore, the ongoing lawsuit between Ripple and the SEC continues to cast a long shadow over XRP. The outcome of this legal battle could have a significant impact on the price, making any predictions inherently uncertain. XRP’s recent price action presents a confusing picture for technical analysts. On the bullish side, we see a significant increase in Futures Open Interest (OI) and derivatives volume, suggesting growing investor engagement. This could be interpreted as a sign of accumulating positions in anticipation of a price rise. Related Reading: Ethereum Longs Crushed! Who Got Burned In The $62 Million Fire Sale? However, the bullish narrative is challenged by the oversold RSI reading currently hovering near 35. In traditional technical analysis, this suggests the asset might be due for a correction, potentially contradicting the predicted price increase. The current situation surrounding XRP is a classic case of conflicting signals. The whale’s buying spree and the technical analysis offer a bullish narrative, while the Fear & Greed Index and the SEC lawsuit paint a more cautious picture.

29514536,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=624798,1718460057,Polkadot (DOT) In Freefall: Will It Recover Or Hit Rock Bottom?,"Polkadot (DOT), a prominent player in the blockchain ecosystem, is currently experiencing a dramatic decline, prompting a bearish alert. The cryptocurrency is in freefall, with its price plummeting towards new lows. A combination of market-wide volatility, negative investor sentiment, and regulatory pressures fuels this sharp downturn. As DOT’s value continues to erode, investors are advised to brace for further losses and reassess their strategies in light of these bearish signals. In this analysis, we will dive into Polkadot’s price prospects with the help of some technical indicators focusing on the 1-hour and the 4-hour timeframe. DOT Price Still Actively Bearish DOT’s price on the 4-hour chart did a retracement after a break from the previous bearish triangle wedge and began to drop again. Although the price currently is attempting to move up, the reality is that it will continue to drop afterward. The formation of the 4-hour Composite Trend Oscillator also suggests that the price of DOT may still drop as the signal line and Simple Moving Average (SMA) of the indicator are currently trending close to the oversold zone. Also, on the 1-day chart, DOT is attempting a bullish move below the 100-day SMA after dropping a bearish candlestick on the past day. Based on the 1-day price formation, it can be suggested that this bullish move that DOT is making is just on a short-term note. Lastly, the 1-day Composite Trend Oscillator on the daily chart signals that DOT’s price is still actively bearish as both the signal line and SMA have crossed below the zero line and are heading towards the oversold zone. More Losses Ahead? In conclusion, Polkadot is currently in a precarious position as it experiences a sharp and sustained decline, triggering a bearish alert. Therefore, if the price of DOT continues to drop, it might move towards the $4.809 support level. And if it breaks below this level it will drop further to test the $3.542 support level and probably other key levels afterward. However, if DOT decides to continue its move in the upward direction, it will begin to move toward the $7.701 resistance level. Should it move above this level, it will move higher to test the $9.805 level and probably go bullish to test other key levels. As of the time of writing, DOT was trading at around $6.23 and was down by 2.58% with a market capitalization of over $8.9 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of over $204 million. Although its market capitalization is down by 2.52%, its trading volume has increased by 19.08% in the past day.

Expectedly, this bearish pressure has had a notable impact on the price of the premier cryptocurrency. According to data from CoinGecko, the value of Bitcoin has declined by nearly 5% in the past seven days. On Friday, June 14th, the BTC price fell to around the $65,000 level — its lowest level in nearly a month. Bitcoin Miners Offload Over 1,200 BTC In One Day In a recent post on the X platform, crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed that Bitcoin miners have been active in the open market in recent days. Specifically, these network entities have been trimming their BTC holdings, and selling their assets for profit. Related Reading: Quiet Summer Ahead For Bitcoin, But Ethereum Holds Potential for Surprise — QCP Capital Martinez mentioned in his post that the Bitcoin miners offloaded more than 1,200 BTC (worth roughly $80 million) in a single day. According to the crypto pundit, this increased selling activity by the miners might have played a significant role in the premier crypto’s recent correction to $65,000. This on-chain observation is in tandem with CryptoQuant’s latest weekly report. The blockchain analytics firm noted that miners were transferring their coins to exchanges and over-the-counter (OTC) desks for sale, as the Bitcoin price hovered between $69,000 and $71,000. According to CryptoQuant, the recent decision of miners to offload their holdings Is associated with the declining revenues following the halving event. With reduced transaction fees and persistently high network hashrates, miner revenues have continued to dwindle over the past few months. Furthermore, CryptoQuant mentioned that historical patterns suggest that sustained low revenues and high hashrate could imply a potential market bottom. Ultimately, this means that the Bitcoin market could be stabilizing or getting ready for upward movement. Whales Join The Sell-Off, Dump 50,000 BTC Further on-chain observations show that miners are not the only entities responsible for the recent selling pressure. In another post on X, Martinez revealed that Bitcoin whales have also been offloading significant BTC amounts in recent days. Based on data from Santiment, whales have sold 50,000 BTC (equivalent to about $3.3 billion) in the past 10 days. Bitcoin whales – in this particular data point – refer to holders that own between 1,000 – 10,000 BTC.

After a meteoric rise earlier this year, WIF has been on a downward spiral, trapped within a descending channel since late May. Analysts are carefully keeping tabs as the canine crypto approaches a critical support level, with its future hinging on a tug-of-war between bullish and bearish forces. Related Reading: Red Alert For Polkadot (DOT): Double-Digit Drop Sparks Investor Fears Descending The Price Ladder: A Sign Of Weakness? Technical analysis paints a worrying picture for WIF. The descending channel pattern, characterized by lower highs and lower lows, indicates sustained selling pressure. The price has plummeted a staggering 30% since the end of May, currently hovering around the crucial $2.44 mark. In the last week, WIF has lost 15% of its value, data from Coingecko shows. This level represents a make-or-break point for WIF. If the bulls – those optimistic investors hoping for a price increase – can’t defend this support line, the price could plunge further, potentially reaching a new low of $1.93. A Technical Tailspin Adding fuel to the bearish fire is the Aroon Down indicator, a technical tool that gauges the strength of a downtrend. WIF’s Aroon Down Line sits at a concerning 100%, signifying a robust downtrend with the most recent low occurring not too long ago. This suggests that selling pressure is overwhelming any potential buying activity among WIF holders. Will The Bulls Rise To The Occasion? A glimmer of hope remains for WIF devotees. If the bulls manage to hold the current support level, a price rebound towards the resistance line at $2.70 is a possibility. This would be a temporary reprieve, but it would offer a chance for the memecoin to regroup and potentially break free from the descending channel. However, breaching the support would be a devastating blow, potentially leading to a domino effect where investors lose confidence and flee the market, sending WIF into a tailspin. WIF Price Forecast Related Reading: NEAR Protocol: From Recent Dip To Google Search Darling – Is $16 Next? Meanwhile, the current technical analysis for Dogwifhat shows a bearish sentiment, despite a bullish price prediction of a 225% increase to $7.87 by July 15, 2024. The Fear & Greed Index indicates high greed at 74, suggesting potential overvaluation. Over the past 30 days, Dogwifhat has had 30% green days with 11.82% price volatility, reflecting significant price fluctuations. The high volatility and current greed sentiment indicate potential risks, despite the optimistic forecast. Therefore, it may not be the best time to buy Dogwifhat until market conditions stabilize or additional positive indicators emerge.

Market expert Michael van de Poppe has shed light on the reasons behind this ongoing bloodbath, highlighting several key factors that have contributed to the current state of the market. Crypto Market Battles Uncertainties A key event highlighted by van de Poppe is last Wednesday’s release of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, which has a major impact on the Federal Reserve’s decision on interest rates. The data, which came in lower than expected, favored risk assets. A lower-than-expected headline CPI of 3.3% (vs. 3.4% expected) and core CPI of 3.4% (vs. 3.5% expected) pointed to potential rate cuts or a positive outlook for future rate cuts, providing favorable market conditions. Related Reading: Red Alert For Polkadot (DOT): Double-Digit Drop Sparks Investor Fears Another significant event was the release of the Producer Price Index (PPI) data, which provides inflation data from the producer’s perspective. The data revealed a lower-than-expected regular PPI score of 2.2% (versus an expected 2.5%) and Core PPI Y/Y score of 2.3% (versus an expected 2.4%). Additionally, the monthly data showed negative figures, further favoring risk-on assets. However, van de Poppe contends that despite these positive indicators, the crypto market has continued its downward trend. According to van de Poppe, the release of consumer sentiment data on Friday also impacted the market. Consumer sentiment is considered a market leader and a gauge of market strength or weakness. The data came in lower than expected, with a score of 65.6 (versus an expected 72.1). This data signaled a lack of economic strength, potentially fueling bullish sentiments for risk-on assets and a shift toward crypto-native markets. However, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell delivered an unexpectedly hawkish speech. Despite data pointing towards the need for rate cuts and worsening economic conditions, Powell maintained a hawkish tone and revised the potential rate cuts in 2024. According to Michael van de Poppe, this outlook did not bode well for the markets, adding to existing uncertainties and the notorious price volatility seen in recent days. Bitcoin Price’s Struggle Continues As Bond Yields Drop The analyst further pointed out that Market indicators, such as Treasury Bond Yields, declined. The 2-year Treasury Bond Yield dropped to the lowest point in two months, while the 10-year Yield continued its fall to the lowest point since the beginning of April. These indicators typically suggest favorable conditions for Bitcoin and risk-on assets, implying a higher probability of a potential rate cut. However, the strength of the US Dollar persisted due to the rate cut by the European Central Bank (ECB). Van de poppe believes that this unexpected Dollar strength, driven by the ECB’s actions, further complicated the market dynamics, as rate cuts are usually necessary for economic stability. Related Reading: NEAR Protocol: From Recent Dip To Google Search Darling – Is $16 Next? In sum, the cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin, has substantially declined as it struggles to regain its previous highs. Despite positive economic data pointing towards potential rate cuts and market indicators favoring risk-on assets, the market has failed to respond positively. The ongoing uncertainties surrounding events, such as the listing of the Ethereum ETF, have contributed to the market’s weakness. With rate cuts on the horizon and the Dollar’s strength persisting, the upcoming weeks will likely be critical in determining the market’s direction.

The research firm, which is well known for spotting new market trends, points out that the data patterns in the charts suggest that we are likely to have a more shallow trading period for now. This comes as the market is still recovering from recent highs and lows, consigning traders in limbo trying to make sense of the next big play. Related Reading: Is The Crypto Surge Over? Bitcoin Stalls At $72,000 As Investor Enthusiasm Wanes Ethereum Is In For An Active Summer Despite Anticipated Market Lull The one exception is that the Ethereum options show significantly higher implied volatility than that of Bitcoin. This suggests that although the market, in general, could cool off, Ethereum could still see a relative surge in trade. In their report, QCP Capital advised traders to consider accumulation strategies, particularly for Ethereum, in preparation for what they term “the long, quiet summer.” This approach could be beneficial if the market maintains its predicted low volatility. Additionally, they do not foresee any significant price movements for Ethereum in July, aligning with the expectations set around the potential approval of a spot Ethereum spot Exchange-traded funds (ETFs later in the summer. However, the speculation surrounding the approval of an Ethereum spot ETF is creating a buzz, with traders eyeing the S-1 Form approval that could bring more action to Ethereum’s market. Ethereum’s implied volatility currently stands at a 10 vol premium to Bitcoin, which QCP analysts expect to narrow as the market begins to price in the anticipated US spot ETF approval. This suggests that while the summer might be quieter, there could still be critical developments that could influence market dynamics in the latter part of the season. Bitcoin & ETH Market Performance And Sentiment Reflecting on recent market performance, Bitcoin and Ethereum have shown noticeable declines. After a bullish phase spurred by the US SEC’s approval of spot Ethereum ETFs last month, cryptocurrencies have closely mirrored each other in market downturns. Related Reading: Analyst Who Correctly Predicted Bitcoin’s Surge And Crash Reveals Where Price Is Headed Next Over the past week, Ethereum has seen a significant 8.5% decline, with a 1.4% drop in just the past 24 hours.

29493378,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=624713,1718416810,Crypto Analyst Lists The Cardano Developments That Will Drive ADA Price To $3 In 2024,"Crypto analyst Sebastian has outlined why he believes Cardano (ADA) could rise to as high as $3 this year. The developments the analyst highlighted undoubtedly paint a bullish picture for the crypto token. However, it remains to be seen how Cardano will react, given that it is currently one of the worst-performing crypto assets this year. Why Cardano’s Price Is Posied To Reach $3 This Year Sebastian mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post four reasons he believes Cardano will reach $3 this year. First, he mentioned Cardano’s partnership with Argentina. The Cardano Foundation recently announced its partnership with Entre Ríos, a central province in the country. The move is aimed at fostering blockchain adoption in Argentina. The partnership also benefits ADA as it will help the network break into the Argentine market. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts 35% Jump For Bitcoin In Next Step Of ‘Magic Bands’ Secondly, Sebastian mentioned the Chang Hard Fork as another reason Cardano is poised to reach $3 this year. This network upgrade is supposed to usher in Cardano’s “Voltaire” era, focusing on decentralized governance. Once this Chang Hard Fork occurs, the Cardano network will become more community-driven, which can help uplift the Cardano ecosystem and further boost investors’ confidence. Sebastian alluded to the new decentralized applications (dApps) launching on Cardano as another reason the crypto token can reach $3 this year. The launch of these dApps will help increase Cardano’s network activity and ultimately positively impact ADA’s price since the crypto token will gain added utility. Lastly, Sebastian mentioned that 1.5 billion Cardano tokens will be unlocked for marketing and other investments. He believes these funds could go a long way in promoting the Cardano ecosystem and attracting new users. However, some of his followers disagreed with him in this regard, noting that unlocking this significant amount of tokens would only put massive sell pressure on DA. Cardano Chang Hard Fork Is A “Big Deal” Crypto analyst and Cardano bull Dan Gambardello recently remarked that the Chang Hard Fork is a bid deal for the Cardano ecosystem, seeing as the network will pivot into “an ear of decentralized, community governance.” The network upgrade is expected to go live later this month, with Gambardello claiming this is excellent timing for the altcoin season. Related Reading: XRP Continues To Struggle Below $0.5, Ex-Ripple Director Reveals Why Price Action Remains Muted Gambardello has remained bullish on Cardano despite its unimpressive price action and has even reassured his followers that the crypto token’s current price action is normal. He stated that ADA was in a similar position in the last bull run but still recorded a massive price in that market cycle. He expects something similar to happen again and suggested that ADA’s big move could come once the Altcoin season kicks into full gear. At the time of writing, ADA is trading at around $0.4, down over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Bitcoin Investors Are Displaying FOMO After The Recent Decline As the analytics firm Santiment pointed out in a new post on X, the recent drawdown in the cryptocurrency has instigated the second-largest spike of buying interest in social media users in the past two months. The indicator of interest here is the “Social Volume,” which keeps track of the amount of discussion related to a topic or term in which users on the major social media platforms are participating. Related Reading: Dogecoin Plunges 11%, But This On-Chain Cushion Could End Decline This metric makes this measurement by counting the unique number of posts/threads/messages on these platforms that mention at least one keyword. The reason the indicator counts the posts rather than the mentions themselves is that sometimes, a large number of mentions can appear on social media. Still, the location of these mentions could be restricted within niche circles. The total number of posts mentioning a topic only spikes when users in the wider social media also engage with the term. As such, the Social Volume can provide a more accurate representation of the actual degree of talk related to the keyword. In the context of the current discussion, Santiment has used this indicator to pinpoint data related to terms connected with buying and selling Bitcoin. The chart below shows how the social volume for these two topics has changed over the past month or so. As is visible in the above graph, the combined Social Volume of phrases related to “buy Bitcoin” has just observed a large spike. This sharp increase in the indicator has come as the cryptocurrency price has been going down. It would seem that users on social media believe this dip to be a worthy buy. The chart shows that the scale of this buying interest is the largest witnessed in the market since BTC’s rally above $70,000 last month. It’s also apparent, however, that BTC topped out not soon after this Social Volume spike came. This has often been the pattern observed, as the price becomes more likely to be corrected when FOMO takes over the crowd. Generally, any negative effects of FOMO can be canceled out if a sufficient amount of FUD also arises in the market simultaneously. As highlighted in the graph, though, the Social Volume of the terms related to “sell Bitcoin” has stayed low amid the spike in calls for buying. Related Reading: Solana Set For “A Major 53% Price Move,” Analyst Reveals Why As such, this high amount of optimism around the drawdown could suggest that the bottom is perhaps not here for the cryptocurrency yet.

This analysis comes as Bitcoin’s current trading behavior exhibits signs that might concern short-term investors. Related Reading: Financial Giant AllianceBernstein Predicts Bitcoin At $1 Million, Here’s When Bitcoin’s Precarious Path: Potential Drop and Subsequent Rally Brandt’s analysis indicates that if Bitcoin breaks the $65,000 threshold, it could trigger a further drop to around $60,000, potentially dipping as low as $48,000. So far, Bitcoin has struggled to sustain momentum above the $70,000 mark, showing a decline of 5.6% over the past week to a current value of $67,170. Despite the somewhat grim short-term outlook, Brandt identifies a silver lining with the potential for substantial recovery. His analysis outlines the immediate risks and hints at a rebound, which he terms the “pump” phase following the “dump.” Chart of interest – Bitcoin $BTC Sometimes the most obvious interpretations of a chart work out, most of the time the charts morph.

Earlier in the year, he made similar observations when Bitcoin was trading at $42,300, suggesting these cycles are common features of bull markets and play a crucial role in distinguishing between novice traders and experienced investors. JPMorgan Cautions On Bitcoin Touted ETF Demand Meanwhile, financial institutions like JPMorgan have scrutinized the broader implications of market dynamics on Bitcoin’s valuation. JPMorgan has recently highlighted concerns regarding the overestimation of demand for Bitcoin ETFs. Their analysis suggests that much of the recent inflow into Bitcoin ETFs does not represent new capital but rather a rotation from traditional cryptocurrency exchange wallets to “more regulated and seemingly secure” ETFs. This shift has been driven by “cost-effectiveness, regulatory protection, and deeper liquidity” ETFs offer over conventional crypto wallets. JPM SAYS #BITCOIN ETF DEMAND OVERSTATED BY 2x –> “Not all of these inflows represent fresh money entering the crypto space as we believe there has likely been a significant rotation away from digital wallets on exchanges to the new spot bitcoin ETFs.
