42409898,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcQN1p,1692660031,Bitcoin Developers Push Back Against Craig Wright’s Claim to Billions of Dollars in Bitcoin,"A group of bitcoin developers is fighting a lawsuit in the UK alleging they wrongfully refused to help Craig Wright’s crypto company retrieve billions of dollars worth of bitcoin that the company allegedly lost in a hack, a Monday court filing shows.  Lawyers for 12 developers told the UK High Court that the company, Tulip Trading, never owned the 111,000 bitcoin it is trying to claim. The company, the developers allege, has “fabricated” documents to prove ownership of the tokens and fraudulently gain control over the funds. The Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund, an organization funded by Twitter (now X), Bluesky and Block (formerly Square) founder Jack Dorsey and others, shared the filing.  Tulip Trading “never owned the digital assets and has commenced this claim fraudulently and in reliance on fabricated documents, "" the developers’ lawyers said in a statement. “Dr. Wright has a long history of fraud, forgery, and dishonesty … [and is using] the English courts as an instrument of fraud.”  There is no evidence that Wright or his company ever owned either wallet that held the bitcoin in question, they alleged.  The allegations come after Wright, who alleges he is bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto, sued the developers in 2021 for refusing to build a backdoor mechanism in a bitcoin-based software that would enable Tulip Trading to seize control of the crypto it claims to have owned and lost. According to Wright's lawyers, the developers failed in their “fiduciary duty” by refusing to help Tulip Trading.  Craig Wright was not immediately available to respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment.  Wright has a long history of litigating disagreements. Last month, a U.K. court dismissed Wright's lawsuit alleging crypto exchanges Coinbase and Kraken infringed on his copyright by using the name “Bitcoin.""  And, last year, Wright lost a preemptive lawsuit alleging he had lied about being Satoshi.  Currently, Wright is involved in at least three lawsuits in Oslo, Norway; London, U.K.; and Miami, U.S.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Elizabeth Napolitano,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/08/21/bitcoin-developers-push-back-against-craig-wrights-claim-to-billions-of-dollars-in-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f87dd920b076692e8d81ab3bec204353d6c23f31-4817x3211.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The failure to sustain this level has resulted in a decline to $26,000. Interestingly, Bitcoin’s recent reversal has coincided with speculations of an imminent bull run, with many believing that the cryptocurrency winter is over and that lower price levels will not be revisited. Nonetheless, this sentiment shifted on July 14th when the US Dollar Index (DXY) initiated a robust rally, surging from 99 points to its current level of 103. As the DXY began its ascent, Bitcoin’s trajectory turned downward, leading to a downtrend that caused the cryptocurrency to relinquish a significant portion of its 2023 gains. Conversely, before July, BTC experienced a surge to its yearly high of $31,800, while the DXY declined. Despite this development, Glassnode co-founder Yan Allemann suggests that in the coming months, it will be Bitcoin’s turn to reclaim the spotlight and assert its dominance once again. BTC’s Last Consolidation Phase? Glassnode co-founder Yan Allemann has shared insights on the current market conditions and predicts an imminent surge in Bitcoin’s value as the autumn approaches. Allemann’s analysis suggests that the US Dollar is expected to reach a peak level of 106, which will catalyze a prime environment for Bitcoin. Historically, the inverse correlation between the Dollar and Bitcoin has been observed, where a stronger Dollar tends to put downward pressure on the cryptocurrency’s price. Conversely, a peak in the Dollar often coincides with a favorable environment for Bitcoin to thrive. Related Reading: Dogecoin Proof Of Stake Discussion Heats Up As Lead Dev Chimes In This said, Allemann believes that Bitcoin is projected to reach the $37,000 level before embarking on a significant upward movement during the autumn season. This anticipated surge in value aligns with the patterns observed in previous market cycles, where Bitcoin has experienced notable price rallies during the latter part of the year. It remains to be seen how this narrative unfolds, but one thing is clear: the dynamics between Bitcoin and the US dollar continue to shape the cryptocurrency landscape. Historical Data Reveals September Struggles For Bitcoin According to data by CoinGlass, August, and September have historically presented challenges for Bitcoin, making them notorious months for the cryptocurrency’s performance. With 10 days remaining until the monthly close, August has already proven to be a difficult month for Bitcoin, experiencing a 12% decline over the past 30 days. However, this downtrend may not come to a halt just yet, as historical data indicates that September could pose additional obstacles to Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Examining the chart above, it becomes evident that September has historically been a challenging period for Bitcoin. In some instances, the cryptocurrency has witnessed substantial price drops, reaching as high as 19%. This suggests that the coming month could potentially be characterized by further downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price. However, it is important to note that historical trends also indicate the possibility of more modest declines. In 2013, for example, Bitcoin’s price only decreased by 1% during September, defying the broader negative sentiment associated with the month. This demonstrates that while September has a historical reputation for difficulty, it does not guarantee a significant downturn for Bitcoin in every instance. Related Reading: Gemini Hits Back At SEC Lawsuit With Dismissal Filing While Bitcoin has faced headwinds in August and historically in September, it is worth remembering that the cryptocurrency has demonstrated resilience and the ability to recover from downturns in the past. Market conditions, macroeconomic factors, and regulatory developments can all contribute to the price fluctuations of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

42409886,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcQMRS,1692651556,Sam Bankman-Fried Due Back in Court as He Asks for Daily Releases,"Sam Bankman-Fried will have five and a half hours with his attorneys, minus any time spent being arraigned yet again Tuesday on his latest indictment, which folded campaign finance allegations into existing charges.  Bankman-Fried, who pleaded not guilty to most of those same charges, faces a new superseding indictment after prosecutors said they would have to drop the campaign finance-specific charge due to treaty obligations with the Bahamas. The FTX founder was recently sent to jail after a federal judge ruled he’d violated his bond conditions twice in attempting to manipulate or intimidate witnesses against him.  His attorneys asked that Bankman-Fried be allowed to access two internet-enabled laptops and two “mobile WiFi devices” from conference rooms within the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the courthouse every weekday, and be able to work on his defense “for the entire day” on Aug. 22, 2023.  Judge Lewis Kaplan, the Southern District of New York jurist overseeing the case, had told the parties during an Aug. 11 hearing that he would entertain applications for temporary release into counsel’s offices.  As of Monday at 5:00 p.m. ET, he had not yet weighed in on the defense team’s application for daily access, but ruled that Bankman-Fried could meet with his attorneys in the U.S. Marshals Service’ attorney room from 8:30 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. ET on Tuesday.  He also limited the number of laptops and WiFi-enabled devices to one apiece rather than the two each requested.  Judge Kaplan did set a Wednesday deadline for the defense to provide information about Bankman-Fried’s proposed “advice-of-counsel defense.”  “The Government is left to guess whether it is the defendant’s assertion that he received legal advice relating to his deletion of Slack and Signal messages – a defense he alluded to at the August 11, 2023, conference … or that his fraudulent misappropriation of billions of dollars was somehow laid fully before legal counsel, who approved of the conduct, or that the defendant received legal advice on any other particular aspect of the conduct at issue, or a combination of these defenses, or something else entirely,” the DOJ said in a Friday filing.",NEUTRAL,없음,REGULATION,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/08/21/sam-bankman-fried-due-back-in-court-as-he-asks-for-daily-releases,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/22ced279bdd336d9987af5f7c11dc67f86651cc1-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The mass liquidations and panic from the selloff caused BTCUSD daily charts to reach the most oversold level since the COVID crash in early 2020. BTC Panic-Selling Reaches Extremes Not Seen Since COVID Crash As much as people try to fight it, investing and trading is an emotion-driven process. Few emotions cause humans to take action more urgently than those associated with fear and panic. This is precisely why selloffs tend to be sharper and scarier than bull markets. “Bulls take the stairs, bears ride the elevator” is just one adage that symbolizes this noted market behavior. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Continuation Pattern Points To 3-6 Months Of Uptrend Ahead For example, the COVID collapse in March 2020 took only a matter of days to erase 70% of Bitcoin’s price. This instance was the last time the Relative Strength Index technical indicator on the daily timeframe became this oversold. After Bitcoin’s recently drop this week, the daily RSI is back at a similar extreme for the first time in more than three years. What isn’t clear quite yet, is if the extreme represents another ideal buying opportunity, or if this is the onset of a deeper decline. The RSI has reached the deepest reading in years | BTCUSD on TradingView.com Bitcoin Daily RSI Plunges To Most Oversold Level Since 2020 The Relative Strength Index is a momentum indicator that tells investors and traders when an asset is overbought and oversold on a relative basis. When the tool reaches extremes above 70 or below 30, it can present an opportunity to buy or sell. The RSI is now lower than the LUNA or FTX collapse, or at any point since March 2020. During especially strong moves, however, the RSI can remain elevated for extended phases despite reaching such overheated readings. Such was the case in December 2018, the previous instance of the daily Bitcoin RSI reaching such a low. Related Reading: This Long-Term Bitcoin Price Average Is Setting ATHs In that case, the RSI stayed hot for two full weeks, cutting down BTCUSD price by another 40% before it was all said and done. A 40% correction in Bitcoin would take prices back to the November 2022 bottom. If Bitcoin instead rebounds and reacts more akin to 2020, new all-time highs could be just months away. If not, a deeper reset is possible. #Bitcoin daily RSI is now the most oversold in all of 2023 Act accordingly pic.twitter.com/GpKFAvsonc — Tony ""The Bull"" (@tonythebullBTC) August 17, 2023 Tony is the author of the CoinChartist (VIP) newsletter.

As significant amounts of SHIB change hands, many wonder if these moves signal a forthcoming positive shift in its market position or a rebound, as the asset is currently in a downtrend. Whale Alert, a renowned blockchain tracking platform, disclosed that a transaction of 4.65 trillion SHIB tokens, equating to approximately $38.39 million, moved from Bitvavo to an unidentified wallet. 🚨 🚨 4,653,778,173,637 #SHIB (38,391,343 USD) transferred from #Bitvavo to unknown wallethttps://t.co/KFZzJIvU5q — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) August 21, 2023 High-Value Transactions Coincide With Shibarium’s Developments It’s worth noting that this isn’t an isolated event. A similar transaction occurred just a day prior, where an almost equivalent amount of 4.6 trillion SHIB tokens (around $38.70 million) was transferred from one undisclosed wallet to another. 🚨 🚨 4,669,778,173,637 #SHIB (38,707,791 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to unknown wallethttps://t.co/c6LPXZFq2h — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) August 20, 2023 These high-value transfers correlate with the start of Shibarium, the Ethereum-based layer-2 blockchain, which has been the cause of a spike in SHIB transactions. The surging activity, especially after introducing the Shibarium blockchain, naturally raised eyebrows within the Shiba Inu community. Related Reading: Shibarium Launch Saga: Block Production Resumes Despite Stuck ETH To address rising concerns about the safety of assets, the Shiba Inu team came forward in its “All Is Well” blog post, offering clarity on the technical issues, and emphasizing the security of the users’ assets. SHIB Rebound On The Horizon? While it’s undeniable that there may be growing attention on Shiba Inu, especially after these whale activities and the Shibarium blockchain’s developments. It may be too soon to forecast the exact trajectory SHIB will take. However, analyzing the Shiba Inu price chart suggests there could be a potential rebound, though it might not be imminent. On the 4-hour chart, Shiba Inu displays a pronounced downward wick. This indicates the presence of more liquidity in this downside range, which could suggest further decline as market makers may seek to capture this liquidity. To clarify, a wick refers to the thin line/vertical line above or below the main body of a candlestick. The wick represents an asset’s highest and lowest prices during a specific time frame, such as the candle marked above. Related Reading: How High Can Shiba Inu (SHIB) Rise When Shibarium Restarts?

Their Centre Consortium, which governed the USDC stablecoin, is being dissolved and Circle is bringing the stablecoin fully in-house.  Six new blockchains will integrate with USDC, taking the total to 15. Though not identified, Polkadot, Near, Optimism and Cosmos are chains Circle has said it planned to add in 2023.  Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (COIN) is getting a minority stake in Circle Internet Financial and the companies are dissolving their Centre Consortium partnership that had issued USD Coin (USDC), the world’s second-largest stablecoin.  As part of the move, Circle will bring issuance and governance of USDC fully in-house.  Also, six more blockchains will gain native support for USDC, which is pegged to $1, bringing the total number of supported blockchains to 15.  Coinbase and Circle, in a blog post and interviews with CoinDesk, didn’t disclose how big a stake Coinbase got. Coinbase did not give Circle cash for the stake, according to a person familiar with the matter.  Coinbase and Circle did not identify the six additional blockchains. (Back in September, Circle said it planned to add Polkadot, Near, Optimism and Cosmos in 2023. Subsequent to that, Coinbase started its own blockchain called Base.)  There have been recent tectonic shifts in the world of dollar-pegged stablecoins. Most recently, fintech giant PayPal took a step to shake up the dominance of Tether’s USDT and USDC by introducing its own PYUSD token, in association with Paxos; PayPal could prove a worthy adversary given its deep ties in payments and remittances.  From Coinbase’s perspective, the future of USDC stretches far beyond crypto trading, into areas like foreign exchange, transfers of funds across borders and financial inclusion, according to Phil McDonnell, senior director of product management at Coinbase. But he played down any competition with PayPal.  PayPal’s PYUSD ‘grows the pie’  “I really do believe PayPal grows the pie for us,” McDonnell said in an interview with CoinDesk. “Crypto is so small today compared to the overall financial world. And, so, getting a lot of people in, whether they come through the PayPal door, or some other door, a lot of them eventually will find their way to other things in crypto, including us at Coinbase.”  Regulation of stablecoins remains in its early evolutionary stages, but there are squibs of clarity emerging, said Circle Chief Strategy Officer and Head of Global Policy Dante Disparte. He pointed to the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act of 2023, which has won bipartisan support on a key committee in the U.S. House of Representatives. Disparte also pointed out that Circle recently earned a Major Payment Institution License in Singapore.  “Not only are we at a point where we can retire the Centre Consortium, but doing so makes patent sense because of clarity in the marketplace around regulating stablecoins,” Disparte said in an interview with CoinDesk. “Major companies like PayPal are entering the game and there’s sufficient clarity to abandon what was, for lack of a better term, a stablecoin self-regulatory organization structure.”  BlackRock, Fidelity  Circle also sold stakes last year, raising $400 million from a group including asset managers BlackRock and Fidelity Investments – which have both recently made a splash by attempting to issue spot bitcoin ETFs.  Circle announced last month it was cutting some of its workforce in order to maintain a strong balance sheet and focusing on core business activities.  “Coinbase and Circle will continue to generate revenue from USDC reserves interest income,” according to the blog post. “Under the parties’ new arrangement, this revenue will continue to be shared based on the amount of USDC held on each of our platforms, and additionally we will now equally share in interest income generated from the broader distribution and usage of USDC.”  CORRECTION (Aug. 21, 2023, 20:26 UTC): Fixes the spelling of Dante Disparte's last name.

The nascent sector was moving sideways, but a liquidation cascade forced prices into critical support levels, but the worse might yet come if BTC fulfills a prophecy. Related Reading: Bitcoin Weekly Chart Completes Double Top: Market Shifts Ahead? As of this writing, the Bitcoin price trades at $26,100 with sideways movement in the last 24 hours. Over the past week, the price of BTC corrected back to $26,000 after its lost support at the high of its current levels. Is The Worst Yet To Come For The Bitcoin Price? Bloomberg Intelligence’s Senior Commodity Analyst Mike McGlone shared an analysis on social media platform X. Therein, the analyst classified Bitcoin as one of the “best-performing assets in history,” the cryptocurrency rose from $100 to around $70,000 in less than ten years. At the same time, McGlone pointed out the similarities between the Bitcoin price chart and the 1930s stock market chart. During this period, the US economy went through one of its worse history leading to a series of economic reforms. Comparing both sectors, McGlone forecasted a potential drop in the Bitcoin price once the US Federal Reserve (Fed) turns its monetary policy around. As seen in the chart below, the financial institution has raised interest rates to slow down inflation. As a result, BTC’s price has declined as liquidity leaves financial markets and uncertainty increases. Unlike popular belief, the Bloomberg Intelligence analyst expects the cryptocurrency to dip further if the Fed loses its monetary policy. McGlone explained: One of the best-performing assets in history and a leading indicator — Bitcoin — appears similar to the stock market in 1930. Statistician and entrepreneur Roger Babson began warning about elevated equity prices well before economist Irving Fisher proclaimed a “permanently high plateau” in 1929. The Fed tilts our bias toward a stance similar to Babson’s. The analyst above focuses on the increasing potential benefits for investors getting out of BTC and into government-based financial instruments, such as US Treasury notes which are currently yielding 5%. As long as this environment continues, BTC shows “mostly downward biases,” as the analyst concluded.

42409891,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcQMlI,1692642947,Friend.tech Attracted NBA Influencers. So Why Does Everyone Think Crypto’s Latest Trend Will Die?,"Friend.tech, a decentralized social media app that launched two weeks ago, has officially leapt over hamster racing as the latest crypto trading craze. Judging by the numbers alone, the platform, which counts an NBA player and e-sports juggernaut as early users, and venture capital heavyweight Paradigm as a seed round investor, might already be one crypto’s most successful attempts at dislodging Big Tech nemeses like Facebook and TikTok even at this early date. Unfortunately, none of that means it’ll still be worth any attention at the end of the week.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Something like 64,500 unique addresses have already interacted with the app. However, with pseudo-anonymous blockchains, it’s impossible to say whether that means over 60,000, 600 or just 60 people are actually using FriendTech. Many were rushing to create an account before a possible future airdrop, which hasn’t yet been confirmed. Either way, FriendTech has already made a meaningful impact on crypto.  On a sleepy summer Sunday, for instance, FriendTech generated $1.12 million in fees in just 24 hours (and $2.8 million total since launching Aug. 11 in beta). That’s more than the entire Bitcoin network in the same period and enough to push Base, the Ethereum scaling layer built by Coinbase where FriendTech is housed, above rival networks Arbitrum and Optimism as the largest “layer 2,” after months of jockeying between the two.  In crypto, this meteoric growth obviously means someone is getting rich. The app itself is like an adjacent monetary layer for Twitter profiles, designed for fans who want to buy “shares” in their social media friends and influencers. Although even schlubs like me can claim an account, what we’ll call “celebs” earn a portion of trading fees. The app itself is probably the biggest winner because it takes almost all of the 5% trading fee cut.  FriendTech has already been praised among crypto folk for its reportedly easy UX and UI, a notoriously long issue in an industry where devs seem to take inspiration from Windows 95. It’s mobile-only right now, but does give people the ability to DM the celebs they’re betting on — a unique selling point at a time when Elon Musk’s X has throttled private messaging for most users.  Other winners? A bunch of accounts are already worth more than 3 ETH (~$5,200). “Racer,” who is speculated to have created FriendTech, is the most valuable profile with close to 150 people owning a tokenized share in the profile. Other Twitter influencers like Cobie (who is looking more and more like Elliot Smith these days), Hsaka and Ansem are not far behind. Like many crypto apps since DeFi exchange Uniswap unleashed the innovation, FriendTech also uses a bonding curve algorithm to set prices, a math-heavy system that means trading can happen even when there’s no buyers.  See also: Friend.tech Becomes Massive Ether Money Machine  Bonding curves have been tried in decentralized social media before. The main benefits are economic: it theoretically makes it so anyone can cash in on their reputations and incentivizes people to jump in as early as possible because token prices automatically rise in proportion to the number of tokens in existence. But previous experiments have also left a bad taste in people’s mouths.  Remember BitClout? The flash in the pan social media experiment launched in the waning days of the “Crypto Supercycle.” That app, which later rebranded and expanded into a full-fledged blockchain called DeSo, gripped people’s attention on social media because it pre-funded influencers’ accounts with its shitcoin. It was also given a veneer of respectability by mega-VC backer Andreessen Horowitz and its crush of early adopters looking to get in before the bonding curve slope went asymptotic — before it became toxic to even look at.  Bitclout’s rise and fall is a plus and minus for FriendTech. Predictably, many think FriendTech will also go the way of the dodo given how hard social media on the blockchain has been. However, pseudonymous developer Racer, if he is the creator, apparently was watching and learning from those attempts.  You can count me in the camp that sees this as another bummer summer spectacle, to be quickly forgotten. For one thing, this route of decentralized social media doesn’t really take advantage of blockchain’s actual selling points to increase autonomy and limit “tech censorship.” But also, for many (maybe most?) people watching people monetizing their status is d i s t a s t e f u l. I mean, it’s not the 90s anymore and no one is going to give the NBA’s Grayson Allen trouble for s e l l i n g o u t (Faze Clan was launched to sell out).  This doesn’t mean I am against economic experimentation with social media. The 1,000 true fan hypothesis has been born out over 1,000 times already, and nearly anything is good that makes it easy for people to go “indie” (some things from the 90s will never die). I like Nic Carter and Eric Wall’s Orb project (which isn’t related to Worldcoin). It uses a blockchain to allow influencers like them to monetize their deep crypto knowledge and parasocial relationships. Pay to hold the Orb, get to ask a question. It’s also a working example of the Harberger Tax, a thing of behavioral economic beauty rarely seen in the wild.  Decentralized social media has also been difficult to pull off, even for platforms that don't carry the stain of crypto like Mastodon. Though I’m not sure if that’s because fairer social media itself is hard, or because almost all “decentralized social media” platforms are literally clones of Twitter, including the hip ones like Farcaster, Bluesky and Nostr. Crypto Twitter is the industry’s townsquare, but, guys, have a little imagination.  See also: Social Platform Friend.tech Gains 100K Users in Days Even in Depths of a Bear Market  This is to say nothing of the serious allegations being made about FriendTech, often by people who would likely be able to cash in big if they just shut up and used the app. For one thing, FriendTech seemingly launched without a privacy policy — a huge red flag considering blockchains are troves of personal and financial information. Speaking of, just by signing up, users reportedly grant the app the ability to post on their behalf and there’s evidence FriendTech is leaking wallet information through its API.  Banteg, DeFi legend and crypto dev who posted about many of those perceived issues, crossed the proverbial rubicon today by actually publishing a list of 101,183 FriendTech user accounts, connecting their Base wallet addresses to their Twitter profiles after reportedly seeing a ""leaked"" version of FriendTech’s code repository on Github. Should Banteg be tarred and feathered for doxxing, or would the information have always gotten out? Will it motivate FriendTech to try to fix its problems sooner or accelerate its likely demise?  For its part, FriendTech called The Block irresponsible for reporting on the issue, adding the so-called leak is “like saying someone hacked you by looking at your public Twitter feed” because all the information was gotten through scraping public channels. But, then, that’s exactly the trouble and why people go to lengths to separate their IRL and on-chain identities (that and tax evasion). Banteg pretends to be a rabbit, for instance. Not to put too fine a point on it, but in recent weeks a number of crypto owners have died in mysterious and often very brutal circumstances.  That said, prominent crypterato have said they intend to give FriendTech a fair shake. @0xCygaar said Saturday “I'll be using friendtech to share more raw/opinionated thoughts on various crypto topics” after posting a thread about the protocol’s unique economic incentives. And, even though many early social token experiments petered out, a number seem to be going strong — with FriendTech getting a lead on becoming the central repository for them.  So, in the end, depending on your risk tolerance or motivation for even being interested in crypto, FriendTech may be for you. Unlike July’s hamster racing trend which was just crypto stuck on a wheel, at least social media networks can grow and develop. Then again, the all important first mover advantage that helps explain why Facebook is still a multi-billion dollar platform today doesn't really apply in crypto. Its relatively easy to steal code, make a few tweaks and become the thing everyone is talking about on Twitter that day.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | TRADING | ZRX,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/08/21/friendtech-attracted-nba-influencers-so-why-does-everyone-think-cryptos-latest-trend-will-die,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/96b88a6c0f8cc37fb570eb0221ec7fb395000292-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42409888,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcQMY4,1692642679,Bitcoin Bulls Mull the Meaning of New Fed Messaging on Inflation and Interest Rates,"Bitcoin suffered one of its more dramatic declines ever last Thursday at least in part thanks to the realization that a strengthening economy means interest rates are likely to stay on the rise.  Consumer spending and new home sales data for July both came in stronger than expected last week, prompting the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow tool to up its forecast to very speedy 5.8% GDP growth in the third quarter (July-Aug-Sept).  Those sorts of numbers are typically just seen coming out of recessions and the only time the U.S. has experienced such fast growth in the last decade was in a few of the quarters following the Covid lockdown-induced economic collapse.  Stuck in a tight range roughly between $29,000 and $30,000 for several weeks, bitcoin (BTC) Thursday afternoon dropped to the low $28,000 area thanks to the economic news. That, in turn, triggered a chain of stops and liquidations that sent bitcoin quickly plunging below $25,000. A very modest recovery since has brought the price back to $26,000 at press time.  Rates Higher for Longer?  This week brings the Kansas City Federal Reserve’s annual Jackson Hole Economic Symposium and a keynote speech Friday morning from U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.  Ahead of the talk, the WSJ’s Nick Timaros – known as the Fed Whisperer for his close contacts within the U.S. central bank – Monday morning wrote a column suggesting officials believe the so-called neutral rate of interest could be far higher than previously thought. It’s a fairly wonkish subject, but the takeaway is that the Fed’s benchmark fed funds target – currently at 5.25%-5.50% – could stay a lot higher for a lot longer than market participants expect.  Considering a higher inflation target  Also in the WSJ on Monday was a column from Jason Furman, the president’s top economic advisor during the Obama administration, in which he urged the Fed to consider lifting its inflation target to 3% from 2%.  “A higher target also has the benefit of helping cushion the economy against severe recessions,” wrote Furman. “When the economy slows, higher inflation means that price hikes and wage freezes can become a less unpalatable alternative to widespread layoffs for business looking to cut costs.”  What it means for Bitcoin  Opinions will differ on ideas about a higher neutral rate of interest or a faster targeted rate of inflation, but it didn’t take the bond market long to react to these two pieces of news – the 10-year Treasury yield Monday morning shot higher by nine basis points to a new 16-year high of 4.34%.  Instruments tied to interest rates compete with risk assets like bitcoin for investor dollars, and – at the margin – higher rates means less interest in bitcoin, i.e., why buy BTC when you can earn 5% risk-free in a 6-month CD.  On the other hand, were the U.S. central bank to indicate a tolerance to allow an inflation rate higher than its current 2% target, it would be the sort of official acknowledgement of monetary debasement that bitcoin fans have forever been warning against.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Stephen Alpher,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/08/21/bitcoin-bulls-mull-the-meaning-of-new-fed-messaging-on-inflation-and-interest-rates,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/97680ac486719a8a5b760015e03428c85845dcce-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

16345956,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=548237,1692640820,"Will Bitcoin Retest $20,500 Again? This Pattern May Suggest So","Bitcoin is forming a pattern that has historically led to the asset retesting a specific line. At present, this level would be found at $20,500. Bitcoin Has Dropped Below The 200-Day SMA With The Recent Crash A few days back, Bitcoin observed a sharp crash that took the cryptocurrency’s price toward the $26,000 mark. As this plummet was already significant, many have wondered whether this was it or if the drawdown will continue. An analyst on X, Ali, shared a chart that may provide hints about where the asset could be heading next. The trend in the realized price and the 200-day SMA for BTC | Source: @ali_charts on X The analyst has attached the data for two Bitcoin-related metrics in the graph: the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) and the realized price. The chart shows that the BTC price has dropped below the 200-day SMA (colored in purple) with the latest crash. According to the analyst, when the cryptocurrency’s price has crossed below this level during the past ten years, it has often retested the realized price (colored in orange). The “realized price” here refers to the cost basis or the buying price of the average investor in the BTC market. This means that whenever the cryptocurrency dips below this level, the average holder enters a state of loss. On the other hand, breaks above the line imply a return to profits for most of the market. Historically, this metric has had some interesting interactions with the spot price of the coin. During bullish periods, the line has generally supported the asset, while during bearish periods, it has acted as resistance. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Consolidates Losses and At Risk of Fresh Decline To $25K The explanation behind these curious interactions may lie in how the investors’ minds work in each period. In bull markets, the average investor may think that the price will only go up, so whenever the asset drops to its buying price, they accumulate more of the asset. Similarly, in bearish trends, the holders may believe the cryptocurrency will only go down, so the price they bought in (their break-even mark) would be the ideal exit opportunity. This buying and selling may cause the level to act as support and resistance in the respective regimes. The latest example of this behavior was seen earlier in the year when Bitcoin rebounded off the line back in March. As the asset now appears to have broken below the 200-day SMA, it may be heading towards a retest, as has often happened many times in the past. Related Reading: Here Are The Factors That Could Be Behind The Latest Bitcoin Wipeout Right now, the cost basis of the average investor is $20,500, which means that if BTC is going to touch this line again, a significant drawdown would need to occur. If this scenario indeed plays out, then it’s possible that Bitcoin could find a rebound at the realized price once again. A retest failure, however, would be a very concerning sign, as it might signal the return of the bear market.

Related Reading: Experts Explain Why SEC’s Interlocutory Appeal In Ripple Case Was A Mistake In the filing, Gemini stated that the SEC had failed to establish a clear definition of what the regulatory body regards as securities. The exchange also highlighted the absence of well-defined requirements for violating regulatory laws. As a result, the lack of specification in the SEC’s argument hampers the exchange’s ability to respond properly to the allegations put forward. In the Judicial presentation, the exchange urged the court to ignore the “convoluted analysis” provided by the SEC. The exchange has instead advocated for direct questions which would determine if the cryptocurrency in question qualifies as a security. Gemini has also stated that the SEC should provide an identification of the unregistered security and information on the specific sale, highlighting that treating all cryptocurrencies as unregistered security is prejudiced. The company’s lawyer, Jack Baughman also publicly refuted the SEC’s claims in a Twitter post, saying: The SEC is floundering. They can’t even decide what the security is. On the one hand, they claim that the Loan Agreement was a security. On the other hand, they claim that the entire Gemini Earn program was itself a security — an argument absurd on its face. GUSD market cap at $361 million | Source: GUSD Market Capitalization on Tradingview.com Background On The SEC Lawsuit Earlier this year, on January 13, the US SEC filed a lawsuit against Gemini and Genesis, a crypto lender affiliated with Gemini Trust Company. According to the SEC, Genesis loaned the exchange’s users unregistered securities through the Gemini Earn program, allowing the exchange and Genesis to accumulate billions of dollars worth of crypto assets from thousands of investors. Related Reading: Ethereum Whale Avoids Market Crash, Do They Know Something You Don’t? At the beginning of February 2021, Genesis and Gemini initiated a partnership that would offer the Gemini Earn program to retail investors allowing them to loan their crypto assets to Genesis, while the exchange acts as a middleman. Genesis would then invest the crypto assets, and pay users in interest. The SEC alleged that the company, alongside Genesis, violated federal laws via the Gemini Earn program by not registering its offerings and sales with the Commission. The lawsuit was received with an unfavorable response from the exchange’s legal team, which resulted in the dismissal motion submitted on August 18.

Melbourne-based cryptocurrency lender Helio Lending received a sentence for a non-conviction good behaviour bond for a year after it falsely claimed to have a local credit license. The Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) said Helio Lending had been sentenced for stating that it held a local credit license. Helio was sentenced to a non-conviction bond of AU$ 15,000 ($9,600) based on the condition it displays good behaviour for a year. In a media statement, the ASIC said: “Melbourne-based cryptocurrency lender Helio Lending Pty Ltd (Helio) has been sentenced to a non-conviction bond for falsely claiming that it held an Australian credit licence (ACL) when it did not. Helio entered into a recognisance in the sum of $15,000 for a period of 12-months on the condition they are of good behaviour.” The ASIC states the lender made false representations in a news article on its website in August 2019, claiming it held a local credit license. According to the Commission, “Helio was neither an ACL holder nor a representative of an ACL holder at the time the statement appeared.” The ASIC explained that falsely claiming to have an ACL breaches section 30 of the National Consumer Protection Act 2009. The crypto lender was sentenced under section 19B(1)(d) of the Crimes Act 1914. ASIC Will Not Tolerate “Misleading” Statements At the time of the false claim, Helio offered crypto-backed loans to consumers using crypto as security over the loan. The lender pleaded guilty to the charge of making false statements. A further charge relating to alleged content on Helio’s website was withdrawn. ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court commented on Helio’s conduct and sentence, saying: “We expect entities and individuals to provide accurate information to their customers and potential customers. Helio falsely claimed that it held an Australian Credit licence, misleading their customers to believe that they had the protections afforded by such a licence.” The sentence of a non-conviction good behaviour bond means that the lender will only face conviction if it breaks its bond.

16341770,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=548241,1692633603,Dogecoin Proof Of Stake Discussion Heats Up As Lead Dev Chimes In,"Dogecoin Lead Developer, Mishaboar has expressed his doubts about a possible move to a Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchain consensus. The developer has stated that the transition to a POS mechanism is not a “sensible approach” and has highlighted several issues that could develop from the change. Mishaboar Objects To PoS Transition Mishaboar took to social media on August 20, to express his concerns about the potential impacts a PoS transformation could have on Dogecoin’s network and decentralized nature. In a recent Twitter post, he staunchly refuted the transition and stated that if the conversion pulls through, he may leave Dogecoin for another cryptocurrency network with a PoW consensus. Related Reading: Ethereum Whale Avoids Market Crash, Do They Know Something You Don’t? “If this refers to a remote possibility of Doge ever switching to PoS, after what I have seen over the past 2 years, I would probably then move to another PoW crypto and customize the logo in my wallet to have a dog in it,” Mishaboar commented in a Twitter post. Mishaboar has highlighted the possibilities of power imbalances that could result from a PoS switch since a significant amount of a cryptocurrency’s supply is controlled by exchanges. He stated that the change to a PoS consensus could increase the control and influence of exchanges over a network. The developer also pointed out that Dogecoin may face increased regulatory challenges with the transition. Furthermore, Mishaboar explained that cryptocurrencies that have transitioned to a PoS consensus have been overhyped, with most falling short of expectations and failing considerably or becoming so centralized that it contradicts the foundational structure of cryptocurrencies which is in its decentralized system. Mishaboar concludes that transitioning into a PoS consensus does not align with Dogecoin’s futuristic goals and objectives. He mentioned that the benefits of a PoS consensus which is fast transactions can easily be achieved in the Dogecoin network with other solutions like integration of multiple payment channels. DOGE price struggles to recover | Source: DOGEUSD on Tradingview.com PoS Versus PoW Consensus For Dogecoin Ecosystem The broader cryptocurrency community is presently at loggerheads on the merits of a PoS and PoW consensus and Mishaboar’s rejection of a possible Dogecoin transition has sparked debates about the future of Dogecoin cryptocurrency among crypto enthusiasts. Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (POS) are two distinct blockchain consensus mechanisms used to validate transactions and improve the general performance of a blockchain network. And these two consensuses have their different advantages and disadvantages. The advantages of a PoS are seen in its energy conservation and fast transactions. In contrast, a PoW consensus is considered more secure and more decentralized but is energy-intensive. Related Reading: Elon Musk Shows Public Support For Pro-Crypto Presidential Candidate Some crypto investors argue that a PoS consensus would offer greater energy utilization and scalability. Whereas, others have sided with Mishaboar, strongly refuting the idea of centralization and security risks that follow a PoS transition. Mishaboar has been a prominent part of Dogecoin’s development, yet recent statements made by the enigmatic figure have led to speculations about the impact his rejection of Dogecoin’s possible PoS consensus could have on the project’s direction and development.

Binance token $BNB needs to bounce soon, or face a drop into the void. The crypto market is in the red for yet another day. Bitcoin is flirting with $26,000 currently, and should it now fall and go through the support at $25,000 then things could get rather uncomfortable indeed for the entire crypto sector. A bounce in sight? However, bitcoin is battling and bulls do not look as though they will go down without a real fight. A rather large gap on CME is open above, with the upper bound at $27,620. Given that bitcoin is also looking quite oversold, a potential bounce could be seen later today or tomorrow. Plenty of bad news around There is plenty of really negative news on the global financial front, such as Chinese property developer Evergrande going into bankruptcy, but these sorts of events are nearly always priced into the market. With global financial markets at the edge of their own black hole, there will definitely be a need for bitcoin, which is outside of the huge timebomb of $1 quadrillion + in derivatives. Holders should think of this before selling. Binance continues to suffer One issue within the crypto ecosystem is that of the continuing SEC persecution of Binance, the largest crypto exchange in the world by trading volume. Having already published its intentions to sue the exchange and its CEO Changpeng Zhao, the enforcement overhang is having a deleterious effect on Binance. $BNB on the brink For the $BNB exchange token things are looking rather shaky. From a technical perspective, $BNB has fallen out of its bear flag and has lost the $220 support. A measured move out of the flag should still see $BNB fall a lot further, but this is probably immaterial as there is really no kind of decent support until under $50, which is a more than 4x drop into the abyss from here. Should such a calamity befall $BNB, and the exchange goes into a nosedive, the impact for the rest of crypto could potentially be far worse than the FTX and LUNA meltdowns, putting the bull market on hold. If this worst case scenario does come into fruition it should be remembered that bitcoin, ethereum, and some of the fundamentally stronger cryptos might be at bargain basement prices.

After fading from the 26296 area, some buying pressure emerged around the 25874 area, representing a test of the 61.8% retracement of the appreciating range from 25610 to 26298.78. BTC/USD recently depreciated to the 25234.76 area, its weakest print since mid-June. This fresh multi-month low represented a test of a major downside price objective around the 25128.94 area that is associated with selling pressure that increased around the 31862.21 and 30421.29 levels in July. Major Stops were elected below the 27620.46 area during the decline, another downside price objective linked to recent downward pressure around the 30222 and 29665.27 areas. Major Stops were also elected below the 27991.29 area, representing the 23.6% retracement of the broader appreciating range from 15460 to 31862.21. Areas of technical support and potential buying pressure in appreciating ranges from the 15460 and 19568.52 levels include the 23661, 22793, and 21725 levels. Following recent selling pressure, areas of technical resistance and potential selling pressure include the 26798, 27139, 27728, 27766, 28316, 28548, 29154, 29330, and 30443 levels. Above the market, upside price objectives include the 30526, 30611, 30762, and 31145 areas. Upside price objectives related to other levels of buying pressure include the 32125 and 33569 areas, and Stops are cited above additional upside price objectives around the 32043, 34531, 34658, and 35912 areas.

16339883,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=548238,1692630075,Binance Coin Falls Below $210 As BNB Bridge Hacker’s Health Rate Sinks To 0.99,"In a complex tangle of smart contracts, governance proposals, and fluctuating crypto prices, the financial health rate of the infamous Binance BNB Bridge exploiter address (0x48…9bec) has fallen below the critical value of 1, hovering at 0.99. This development is of particular interest, given that the address holds a significant collateral of 784,616.10 BNB and a debt position in the form of USDT and USDC totaling $124 million. The plummeting health rate comes amidst the fall of Binance Coin (BNB) to $207.9, well below the pre-determined liquidation price of $210.80, leading to increased speculation about potential liquidation scenarios. As per a tweet from blockchain security firm PeckShield: “The health rate of the BNB Bridge Exploiter on Venus is 0.99. BNB has dropped to $207.9. The Venus community has passed a governance proposal to whitelist liquidation of the BNB Bridge exploiter’s position before.” Liquidation Contingency: The Binance Plan He Yi, the co-founder of Binance, alleviated some concerns stating, “The BNB collateral of Venus is covered by Binance. When the price of BNB falls, Binance will liquidate it in time. These BNB will not affect the secondary market price, and Binance will be responsible for burning these additional BNB.” Related Reading: Binance In Murky Waters? Analyst Explains Why BNB Must Stay Above This Price Nevertheless, the crypto community and analysts alike are closely following the situation, speculating on whether Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, commonly known as CZ, intends to execute the liquidation to remove the illegitimate BNB from the ecosystem. Renowned analyst Skew remarked regarding the currently ongoing price movements: “”BNB Shorts going at it again + -24% APR (24hr). BNB Aggregate CVDs show takers are net sellers on the day so far. BNB Binance Spot: Quite a lot of spot bids below down to $200, so there will need to be a frenzy of spot selling in order to cause price dislocation or a crash. Large limit buyer has been trying to absorb the sell pressure.” Crypto influencer MartyParty brought this hypothesis into the limelight, stating, “Is CZ trying to liquidate the Venus loan to burn the 900k illegal BNB? Based on the Venus protocol documentation, the loan would have to be liquidated to burn the illegal BNB. That is the only way to remove it from the ecosystem.” This liquidity and governance issue comes after an “exploiter” illegally minted 2 million $BNB through a vulnerability in BNB Bridge, which has since been repaired. Of this illegally minted BNB, 900,000 BNB was used as collateral on Venus Protocol to obtain a loan exceeding $150 million in stablecoins, which was then dispersed across multiple blockchains. On June 12, 2023, a potential liquidation was averted when Binance stepped in to add $30 million in USDT margin, bringing the liquidation price down to $212. Again on August 17, another liquidation was sidestepped, pulling the liquidation threshold down to $210.80 and consequently the health rate to 1.02. Related Reading: Curve DAO Scores $5 Million Boost From Binance, Eyes BNB Chain Expansion In an earlier reaction to MartyParty’s query, CZ seemed unfazed: “Took me a while to understand (IF I even vaguely understand now). So, Marty is worried about a $30-120m worth re-buy of #BNB? Maybe he should check the last BNB burn? or the #SAFU insurance fund size?” He also commented on the volatility of BNB, adding, “And where did the $212 magic number come from? #BNB price is determined by the market. A $30m re-buy is less than 4% of a single day’s volume.” As of this writing, the market is still uncertain, waiting for further signals from CZ, who hasn’t commented on the latest developments. Meanwhile, Arkham Intelligence’s dashboard remains a focal point for real-time updates on the loan status and the health rate of the exploiter’s account. At press time, no liquidation took place yet. At press time, the BNB price was at $210.5.

The database, listed briefly on GitHub and now withdrawn, apparently listed the crypto wallet addresses and linked X accounts. The growth correlates with the huge revenues made by the platform since its Aug. 10 launch, with over $25 million in fees generated, according to DefiLlama. A Dune Analytics dashboard corroborates the finding, pegging the number of unique users to at least 80,000, with 15,000 users added since Sunday.  A slew of personalities outside of crypto circles on X joined Friend.tech. Richard “FaZe Banks” Bengtson II, co-founder of the influential esports community FaZe Clan, joined the platform late Sunday and saw his share prices quickly become among the most expensive. Shares of NBA player Grayson Allen also surged in the hours after joining. The shares grant the holders privileges, such as the ability to send private messages to the sellers.  While the GitHub repository itself has created concerns about users viewing blockchain transactions linked to these wallets, some developers suggest that the wallet addresses going public doesn't matter and isn't an immediate cause of worry.  ""For most tech-savvy users it was obvious that Twitter and deposit addresses can be linked,"" said @AlexSmirnov. ""I think friend.tech should have made it more explicit and notified users that their deposit address will become public and will be traced by Twitter profile.""  @Bantg, the Yearn Finance developer, suggested in a Monday tweet that users had given Friend.tech permission to post on X on their behalf – which could open up a possible attack vector.  Meanwhile, Friend.tech is quickly going viral. The platform has made over $1.04 million in fees, set at 5% of the value of each transaction over the past 24 hours. That’s banked the platform some $709,000 worth of ether in revenue (what the platform takes after paying out gas fees and other costs), data from DefiLlama shows.

Whale movements typically indicate that an altcoin could potentially get a significant level of attention or spike in value in the future. Recently, whales behind the ApeCoin (APE) and VeChain (VET) cryptocurrencies began accumulating Pomerdoge (POMD).. Summary● ApeCoin decreased in value by 69.6% during the year● VeChain is down 9.3% in the past 30 days● Pomerdoge (POMD) attracts whale attention with potential 17x spike Click Here To Find Out More About The Pomerdoge (POMD) Presale ApeCoin (APE) Price Movement As of August 14, 2023, the ApeCoin (APE) cryptocurrency traded at a value of $2.08. During the past week, its low point was at $1.79, with its high point at $2.10. Moreover, the ApeCoin crypto had a market cap of $769,172,736 and a 24-hour trading volume of $143,182,381. In the past week, its price increased by 12.1%. However, during the past year, the ApeCoin price decreased by 69.6%, and this worried investors. As a result, many whales began diversifying from the cryptocurrency. In any case, according to the ApeCoin price prediction, it is expected to reach $2.32 by the end of the year. VeChain (VET) Price Prediction Then there's VeChain (VET), a competing project that was also initially accumulated by whales. As of August 14, 2023, It trades at $0.01834331. In addition, during the past week, the low point for VeChian was at $0.01740241, while the high point was at $0.01834902. The overall VeChain crypto market cap was at $1,333,631,743, with its 24-hour trading volume at $34,511,656. As of recently, it showcased a bearish performance, as in the past 30 days, it's down 8.3%. It did attempt to recover in the past week with a 3.1% increase, but its decrease has been higher. According to the VeChain price prediction, it can reach $0.023 by the end of the year. Pomerdoge (POMD) to Spike 17x With the recent bearish performance behind ApeCoin and VeChain, whales began to diversify. The main cryptocurrency they've switched to is Pomerdoge (POMD). It's a unique ecosystem that combines the best elements of meme-coins and the Play-to-Earn (P2E) sector to provide an innovative experience. There are three main components behind it, including Pomergame, Pomerplace, and an NFT collection. Pomergame is a virtual world where players can explore and finish objectives in order to get virtual rewards or items of value. They are rewarded for their time committed to the game. Each player has a character called a Pomer. Once a Pomer reaches gold status, it can then enable them to enter the Pomerplace. This is the dedicated marketplace in which anyone can buy, sell or trade valuables. However, it also features an Arena where players can compete. Subsequently, there's a 7,777 NFT collection, where anyone who holds the POMD token can buy each NFT for 0.2 ETH. During the early presale period, Pomerdoge (POMD) trades at just $0.008. However, analysts are bullish on its future and predict that it can spike in value by 17x at launch.

In simple language, Vitalik Buterin and his fellow co-founders of Ethereum wanted the blockchain to be able to do things other than just send payments, which was Bitcoin’s primary and only use-case at the time. Fast forward eight years, and now Bitcoin is able to do all kinds of things that it couldn’t before. Some projects have made Bitcoin compatible with smart contracts, enabling it to be used with the plethora of dApps in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, and even allowing NFTs known as ‘Ordinals’ to be created on Bitcoin for the first time. Enter Ordinals - Bitcoin’s Own NFTs The success of Ordinals - which inscribe immutable data, such as texts, images and audio - onto a satoshi (the smallest unit of BTC) has been immense. Upon launch they clogged up the Bitcoin blockchain, causing exchanges such as Binance to temporarily halt withdrawals and bringing the Bitcoin network to a grinding halt. The impact of Ordinals was also felt off the blockchain. The idea of using the Bitcoin blockchain to create what is essentially an NFT (Ordinals share the same characteristics of immutability and non-fungibility) caused a rift between developers in the Bitcoin space. Bitcoin was supposed to be a payment network, said one faction. While others lauded this newfound ability to have the same kind of functionality, customization options, and value creation that they’d seen in the Ethereum ecosystem for years. While developers continue to debate the merits of Ordinals, users in the crypto space have apparently embraced them with open arms. Bitcoin Ordinals trading volume rose by an astonishing 2,834% leading into Q2 of 2023, climbing to $210.7 million. More than half a million trades were executed by over 150,000 unique traders, according to the latest data by DappRadar. Overtaking Ethereum That flurry of activity led to Ordinals overtaking Ethereum NFTs in terms of trade volume. The top two NFT collections with the highest sales are Bitcoin Ordinals, according to data from CryptoSlam. Their combined sales of $27.2 million in the past 24 hours completely dwarf the nearest Ethereum NFT in third place, which recorded just $1.59 million worth of sales. Some have suggested that Bitcoin is currently in the process of flipping Ethereum when it comes to being the main home of NFTs in the crypto space based on the numbers above. However, the true impact of Ordinals on Bitcoin is much more far-reaching. As the author of the Ethereum white-paper, Vitalik Buterin, stated in regard to the Ordinals debate: “Ordinals are starting to bring back a culture of actually doing things. It feels like there's real pushback to the laser-eye movement, which is good.” The laser-eye movement refers to those who view Bitcoin purely as a payment system, and base their hopes of future profits on its adoption as a global payment rail. One of the main gripes many ‘laser-eye’ loyalists have had with Ordinals is their tendency to take up space on the Bitcoin blockchain that could have been used for payments. Building an Ecosystem Around Ordinals But the spirit of innovation fostered by the creation of Ordinals hasn’t stopped. Several ventures are under way that aim to refine the Ordinals landscape. One group of developers are trying to introduce a new BTC token standard - BRC-69 - aims to radically reduce the cost of minting and sending Ordinals, moving Ordinals away from the current BRC-20 standard on which they are based. Others are attempting to build a community mentality around the newfound Bitcoin NFTs, and kickstart an ecosystem of development that can put Bitcoin on a level with Ethereum in regards to its decentralized finance capabilities. A collection of some of the smartest minds in the blockchain space have come together to form The Ordinal Council, a group of builders, developers and executives who share the common goal of building out the Bitcoin ecosystem around Ordinals. The Ordinal Council is in the process of launching the first Bitcoin DAO to support grassroots talent and builders around Ordinals and BRC-20, and will form a Bitcoin incubator to help develop a raft of innovative use-cases on Bitcoin, such as gaming, metaverse, GameFi and DeFi projects — few of which have been possible on Bitcoin until now. The Council is set to unveil the first launchpad on Bitcoin - ToshiPad - in the next few weeks, and is in the process of executing its ‘Yellow Collection’ PFP drop, which aims to bring more users into what is already a burgeoning BRC-20 ecosystem. After years of inactivity, all it took was one little satoshi with something inscribed on it to kickstart a maelstrom of innovation and development on Bitcoin, and it’s turning the crypto space upside down.

This is a very rare event as lone miners have a lower chance of mining a block due to the increase in mining difficulty and this solo miner became the 277th solo miner in bitcoin’s history to achieve this. Solo Bitcoin Miner Makes History The solo miner was able to pull off this remarkable achievement using the Solo CKpool mining service. The miner identified with the tag bc1q2za4ejga366sn288273pty8trasn5zs4y9hqg6 used an S17 Bitcoin Miner with a hash power of roughly 1 PetaHash which is way lesser than most BTC mining entities, as was speculated by Con Kolivas, the administrator of Solo CKpool. Related Reading: Experts Explain Why SEC’s Interlocutory Appeal In Ripple Case Was A Mistake Congratulations to miner bc1q2za4ejga366sn288273pty8trasn5zs4y9hqg6 with ~1PH of hashrate at solving the 277th solo block at https://t.co/UWgBvLkDqc! A miner of this size would only solve a block solo on average once every 7 years at current diffhttps://t.co/cNgm1KUqvw — Dr. Con Kolivas (@ckpooldev) August 19, 2023 Perhaps the most interesting thing about this development is that the miner achieved this remarkable reward when mining difficulty was almost at an all-time high of 52.39. Normally, mining Bitcoin with just 1 PetaHash seems impossible compared to other BTC solo miners that were able to pull this off in the past who had hash rate capacity in exa-hashes. It is almost impossible for a solo miner to solve an entire block on their own, due to the increased popularity of BTC mining and the persistent rise in the network hash rate and powerful mining equipment. BTC miners are required to input computational power to solve and add the next Bitcoin block to the network, which creates a valid block hash while using the computational power of multiple mining rigs. However, since the miner was using the Solo CKpool, it allows miners with outdated or inefficient equipment to pool their mining power together, increasing their chances of solving a block, which is what happened here. In their case, this miner was able to retain 98% of the reward. BTC price puts reward for a single block over $160,000 | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com The miner now joins two other solo miners who have been able to achieve this impressive feat in March and June this year using a Solo CKpool and is the third time this is happening so far in 2023. Rise In Hashrate Triggers Surge In Mining Difficulty Over the last few months, the Bitcoin hashrate has been rising rapidly, eventually hitting an all-time high in July. In response to this, the mining difficulty surged quickly and touched its own ATH in the same month. Related Reading: The $200 Million BNB Bridge Exploiter Just Got Liquidated On Venus By July 8, the Bitcoin mining hashrate was at 538.05 EH/s and difficulty surged to 53.9112T a few days later on July 12. However, since then, it has tapered off with hashrate dropping 26% to 424.76 EH/s and difficulty dropping around 3% to 52.39T. Mining difficulty rises to new ATH | Source: CoinWarz Nevertheless, both the Bitcoin hashrate and difficulty are significantly higher compared to the start of 2023, which makes the solo miner’s achievement even more impressive. However, as hashrate and difficulty continue to rise, such occurrences are expected to be fewer as miners with large hashrates dominate the market. In the end, the winner is the Bitcoin network which becomes stronger for it with the increased hashrate. It is also beneficial to BTC investors as a rise in hashrate suggests there is more interest in the digital asset and this can convert to higher prices for the cryptocurrency.

Nautilus enables continuous payment streaming and real-time payroll services on a previously impossible scale. As a first-of-its-kind L3, Nautilus enables more than just instant payments. It can also facilitate Zebec Protocol’s live-payment streaming service at scale, made possible by the fastest EVM environment in web3. Capable of parallel transaction processing, Nautilus is built for scalability, interoperability, and security through interchangeable modules for consensus, settlement, data availability, and transaction execution. This modularity will have a significant impact on how web3 payment infrastructure is composed and adopted. ""Zebec is helping to create a future where money moves more freely, providing individuals, businesses, investors, and teams with quicker and easier access to funds and tokens,"" said Zebec Founder Sam Thapaliya. ""Launching the Nautilus Chain, and the new suite of products built on it, is a significant step towards our vision."" With Nautilus now live, Zebec’s team is set to bring single-side staking and DeFi yields online in select jurisdictions and power ZebecPay - its live streaming web3 payroll services. Zebec is also in the process of launching a traditional payroll app, WageLink, with a planned integration with Circle. With the Nautilus chain functionality, Zebec is able to offer crypto off-ramps directly linked to US bank accounts (via a partnership with CoinFlow) and roll out Zebec Card programs in Asia and Europe. These products and services will augment Zebec's existing services. Zebec started as a continuous settlement protocol that enabled real-time payments, or payment streaming, allowing businesses to pay employees and partners in real-time in a tax-compliant way. However, the limitations of existing blockchain technology soon became apparent. Networks were either too slow or too unreliable to keep up with demand. To solve the issue, Zebec Labs created a next-generation blockchain: fast enough to facilitate payment streaming at scale, which could, critically, integrate with Ethereum-based chains. Originally planned for Zebec’s core DeFi projects for internal payments and value/assets transfer, Nautilus testnet became one of the most prominent testnets in the crypto world. Having facilitated over 50 million transactions, with 400,000 wallets and 3,000 smart contracts deployed in its first 8 months, Nautilus chain has proven its utility and functionality beyond DeFi and opened to projects from other sectors, such as NFTs, Gamefi, etc., thus becoming a “general purpose” L3. A huge upside to Nautilus’ modular system is that it gives developers the flexibility to configure the “chain stack” they use to build their dApps. A modular chain uses interchangeable modules for consensus, data availability, settlement, and execution. Each of these layers can be configured to developer needs or optimized based on the dApp being serviced. Especially at the execution layer, customized rollups can be deployed that optimize for privacy or scalability, or decentralization — whatever is required by the dApp. Modular chains allow for infinite horizontal scaling and greater levels of interoperability. Since developers build from the same pool of modules, code is safer, more battle-tested, and easier to connect. More rollups and parallel chains can be deployed to increase block space and throughput effectively. Nautilus is a pioneer in this new type of blockchain, and its architecture will permanently change how blockchains are built and bring them into the real world. At launch, Nautilus’ settlement layer is built using Solana’s VM, MOVE, and its execution layer on Neon EVM using Solidity smart contracts. Data availability is stored off-chain using Celestia. Nautilus' initial default execution layer will use optimistic rollups, but the team plans to transition to zkRollups for faster settlements, privacy, and even higher levels of scalability. Nautilus is built with Celestia and Eclipse empowering modular chains. Through Celesita, Nautilus allows projects to tailor their consensus and settlement layers. Eclipse allows builders on Nautilus to deploy customized rollups on their execution layer. The result is a chain with Solana-like speeds but with the security and decentralization of Ethereum. According to its engineers, Nautilus has been tested up to 3,000 TPS, but the team expects the number to increase with the transition to zkRollups. By having such a high TPS, Nautilus chain provides a platform that can keep up with the demands of the real world, opening the door to decentralized markets for financial instruments and assets, such as stocks, bonds, real estate, and tokenized real-world assets. Thanks to Nautilus, Zebec can now operate on a much larger scale. Businesses can pay employees and partners in real time through live payments or payment streaming. Zebec’s goal isn’t merely to provide more efficient payment services; it’s to onboard millions of new users through user-friendly, secure payment apps and new use cases. Zebec’s innovation paves the way for pay-as-you-go payment plans for streaming services, car-sharing platforms, gyms, residential clubs, and more. It enables potential new business models and applications not yet created. As Zebec continues to innovate and grow its ecosystem, it invites developers and founders from around the world to join it in creating a more connected, efficient, and accessible financial future. About Zebec Zebec enables real-time and continuous streams of payments and financial transactions for payroll, investments, and more. It was founded in 2021, with investments from Circle, Coinbase, Solana Ventures, Breyer Capital, Republic, and Lightspeed Venture Partners, among others. Zebec already services hundreds of companies, running thousands of continuous payment streams and bringing the blockchain to our day-to-day lives.

42409892,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcQMhz,1692624626,BNB Chain Exploiter Liquidated for $30M on Venus Protocol,"An infamous wallet that had borrowed over $150 million worth of stablecoins from lending and borrowing platform Venus Protocol was liquidated for over $30 million as bnb (BNB) prices fell to $209 this morning.  Over 6.89 million venus bnb (vBNB) tokens, worth $30 million, were likely manually liquidated by the BNB Chain developer team, in line with a November 2022 governance vote.  Liquidation refers to when an exchange forcefully closes a trader's leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader's initial margin. This happens when a trader is unable to meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position or fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open.  Monday’s liquidation follows a similar event from last week where $60 million worth of the exploiter’s loan was liquidated across two transactions.  Why is BNB Chain protecting Venus?  Venus runs on the BNB Chain network. It holds over $620 million worth of various tokens from which $480 million has been borrowed by users.  One of these borrowers is a wallet connected to the notorious BNB Chain exploiter. Last year, an attacker managed to steal over $100 million in bnb tokens by exploiting a bridge, a tool that transfers tokens between various networks, based on the BNB Chain.  The unknown attacker then deposited bnb tokens on the Venus lending protocol to borrow $150 million worth of stablecoins. However, with bnb prices steadily falling in the past year, the massive loan has recently been close to being liquidated – a move that could send bnb prices quickly tumbling as the token is sold in the open market to save the loan.  Such a collapse could even be tumultuous for the multibillion-dollar decentralized finance ecosystem built on BNB Chain. This is why Venus and BNB Chain are working together to prevent such a move.  “As market is very volatile, there is a potential risk that if liquidated, this large portion of BNB may cause more cascading liquidations effect and unnecessary damage to the market and cause more risks to Venus, Venus users, BNB token and BNB Chain,” Venus said in a since-passed proposal in November 2022, where BNB Chain was appointed as the sole liquidator of the BNB Chain exploiter address.  “We will work with Binance and other BNB Chain Ecosystem players to take over the position in case it hits the liquidation line, by repaying the debt in a joint effort. The stability and fund coverage of Venus will be put at the high priority,” the proposal explained at the time.",NEGATIVE,BNB,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | BNB,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/08/21/bnb-chain-exploiter-liquidated-for-30m-on-venus-protocol,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8ed7eb37f74c7af50076d90f9d4766985dd1f4a1-3684x2072.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

16336271,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=548181,1692622826,"XRP Whales Accumulate, Can Price Recover Now?","On-chain data shows the XRP whales have been sharply accumulating recently, something that can help the price recover. XRP Whales Have Continued To Expand Their Holdings Recently According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the largest of the XRP investors have been buying in recent days. The relevant indicator here is the “Supply Distribution,” which tells us about the total amount of the asset that each holder group in the market is carrying in their combined wallets right now. The addresses or investors are divided into these groups based on the total number of coins that they are currently holding. The 10-100 coins cohort, for instance, includes all holders who own at least 10 and at most 100 XRP. In the context of the current discussion, two such groups are of interest: 10 million to 100 million coins and 100 million to 1 billion coins. The combined range of these groups has a lower bound of $5.22 million at the current exchange rate, while the upper bound converts to $522 million. This means that the members of both these groups are the whale entities, with the latter cohort naturally carrying the largest of holders even among these humongous investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Weekly Chart Completes Double Top: Market Shifts Ahead? Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the XRP Supply Distribution for both of these whale groups over the last few months: Looks like both these metrics have observed growth in recent days | Source: Santiment on X As displayed in the above graph, the XRP Supply Distribution for the smaller of the two cohorts (that is, the 10 million to 100 million coins group) has been rising for a while now. This means that these whales have only continued to buy more as the asset’s price has observed an extended drawdown. This behavior hasn’t changed with the latest sharp plunge in the cryptocurrency, either, as the metric has now risen toward the 5.1 billion mark. The largest of whales (100 million coins to 1 billion coins), on the other hand, started to actively dump their coins not too long after the coin hit its top in July. They continued their selling until the recent crash, but following it, they have changed their tune and have participated in some pretty significant accumulation. This is naturally a positive sign for the cryptocurrency, as it means that these humongous whales believe that the current lows should prove to be a profitable buying point. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investors Fall Into Fear As BTC Crashes To $26,500 With this accumulation spree, this cohort as a whole now holds an 11 billion tokens stack. This means that these two whale cohorts combined now carry around 16.1 billion coins of the asset, worth around $8.4 billion. It’s uncertain whether XRP would recover anytime soon, but the buying from the whales is at least a sign that these humongous entities would be supportive of such a move if it happens. XRP Price At the time of writing, XRP is trading around $0.52, down 17% in the last week.

With their world-class team, mesmerizing website, incredible network of connections, and rock-solid plan of action, Solidus AI Tech is ready to bring its products to market and become an active player in the digital economy! What is Solidus AI Tech? Based in Europe, Solidus AI Tech is an IaaS (infrastructure as a service) company that is solving some of the most prevalent, fundamental issues plaguing the digital economy; namely the demand for computational infrastructure. Building out their own 8,000-square-foot facility to house hardware that has been wired with their proprietary algorithms that improve computational costs and efficiencies. In tandem to the physical infrastructure, they are tapping into their resources to provide a full stack of cutting-edge Web3 infrastructural software solutions including Artificial-Intelligence-as-a-service (AIaaS), Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS), High Performance Computing power (HPC), and an Artificial Intelligence marketplace. What does AI Tech Provide? As an infrastructure services company, Solidus AI Tech is providing a suite of four core services that can be used by companies, institutions, and even governments as a foundation to build sustainable digital systems. From metaverse to CBDC to gaming and beyond this is what AI Tech is providing: AIaaS - Artificial-Intelligence-as-a-serviceArtificial intelligence is the frontier of mankind's intellectual flourishing. Considered to be just as, if not more important a technological revolution as was the steam engine, AI has become the building block for new technologies promising to improve the lives of people around the world. Solidus AI Tech has neatly wrapped up a turnkey solution to jumpstart the integrations and implementations of AI into a broad range of applications. BaaS - Blockchain-as-a-serviceBuilding blockchains from scratch is an extremely tedious, long, and resource-intensive (labor and capital) process. Building quality blockchains that can satisfy the security and operational demands of sensitive, high-value operations if even more arduous. Solidus AI Tech is extending its intelligent blockchain designs for any imaginable use case. HPC - High Performance ComputationThe demand for computation continues to grow alongside the world’s population that is coming online and new energy-dependent solutions are introduced into society. Solidus AI Tech provides computation for the most intensive use cases across a multitude of industries. AI MarketplaceThe exchange of automated intelligent processes unlocks an entirely new machine economy that contributes to a potentially entirely new and untapped market segment. Solidus AI Tech will be providing a venue where industrial and individual AI commerce can take place. What are some of AI Tech’s Unique Features? Apart from the four key products that Solidus AI tech provides, there is a mixture of sophisticated novel developments at the design, code, and principle layers of the project that make it stand out from the crowd and supersede all existing solutions attempting to spearhead the enormous, evergreen market segment of Computational Infrastructure. Some of these features include: High Performance Computing Costs reductionNotorious for its insatiable energy demands, HPC is a problem that is looking for solutions beyond just the linear increase of hardware. Solidus AI Tech has developed proprietary algorithms that improve hardware efficiencies by 40% above the benchmark rate of existing industry standards; driving down costs, while increasing efficiency. Eco Friendly Computation IP (Intellectual Property)Going hand-in-hand with its HPC reductions costs, a byproduct of Solidus AI Tech’s focus on optimization has resulted in the creation of innovations granting them intellectual property in the form of algorithmic systems that is much friendly for the environment with its efficient (lowered) consumption of energy and heightened computational capacity. Custom Data CenterSolidus AI Tech has been able to secure a location with some of the lowest-cost energy and highest internet speed internet in all of Europe.

This remarkable achievement was further spurred by the recent news it would list on BitMart, a renowned crypto exchange, all within the first month of the presale's launch. The inception of the Shiba Memu AI stems from the team's previous experiences with exorbitant marketing agency fees. This motivated Shiba Memu to develop a self-promoting AI solution capable of adapting to various practical applications. Presently at $0.021700 per token, Shiba Memu's price experiences scheduled increments every 24 hours due to the team's well-crafted smart contract. This mechanism is particularly appealing to presale supporters, as it ensures that the token purchase price remains lower than the eventual listing price on exchanges. For instance, if purchased today at $0.021700, the increase by the end of the 60-day presale would amount to 10%. Those interested can acquire SHMU tokens via the official Shiba Memu website. The Surge of Shiba Memu: Unleashing AI Potential Shiba Memu's remarkable success can be attributed to its untapped AI potential. In its nascent stages, the AI employs Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Sentiment Analysis to scour the web, primarily focusing on social platforms, for mentions of Shiba Memu. It tailors its promotions accordingly, transforming the brand from a simple cute dog meme to an amusing and engaging one, infused with a sharp sense of humor. The project's forthcoming AI dashboards scheduled for Q4 further stimulate investor interest in meme coins with tangible utility. The project's tokenomics demonstrate a robust structure, with 85% of tokens allocated to the presale, 10% to exchange listing liquidity, and 5% to development. This allocation empowers SHMU holders to actively participate in the future development of the dApp. Crypto Community Propels Shiba Memu's Soaring Engagement In the recent video shared by influencer, CryptoPRNR, Shiba Memu was featured among the top four cryptocurrencies predicted to perform well in the next bull run. Additionally, Shiba Memu was also showcased as the best meme coin to buy in 2023 on investing website Invezz. This recognition highlights the project's strategic advancements and AI-driven capabilities, solidifying its position as a competitive player in the crypto market. The inclusion of Shiba Memu in this selection also reflects the growing interest and attention directed towards AI-powered crypto projects within the broader cryptocurrency community. The Shiba Memu presale is approaching its closing date on the 1st of September. At this juncture, the price is set to reflect an increase of 119% from its launch price, moving from $0.011125 to $0.024400.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Major cryptocurrencies traded flat over the weekend, with alternative tokens showing muted price movement as markets seemed to stabilize following one of the largest liquidation events in recent months. Bitcoin remained steady at around $26,000 with ether little changed from Sunday’s $1,670. “So long as bitcoin continues to hold above $25,000 on a weekly close basis, we suspect we will see renewed demand and a push back to the topside in the days ahead,” crypto exchange LMAX Digital said in a morning note. “If this happens, ether and the rest of the crypto space should follow along.” Meme coin shiba inu (SHIB) slid 2%, increasing losses to more than 21% in the past week following the botched launch of its Ethereum layer 2 network, Shibarium. Transactions stalled in the hours after the network went live last Wednesday, with over $1.7 million worth of tokens in a bridge – a tool used to transfer tokens between two blockchains – said to be stuck owing to a bug in the code.  Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin deposited 600 ether (ETH), which is around $1 million worth of the cryptocurrency, to crypto exchange Coinbase on Monday, according to data from Ethereum blockchain scanning website etherscan. The move comes as ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, suffered a 10% decline over the last seven days, amid a broad market downturn that saw traders witness $1 billion in liquidations. On Sunday, Buterin repaid 250,000 RAI and withdrew $1.6 million worth of ether, according to on-chain tracker lookonchain. RAI is a non-pegged stablecoin backed by ETH. It is not clear why the Ethereum co-founder transferred the ether to Coinbase.  Bitcoin miners are moving into new business areas, including offering high performance computing (HPC) services to the fast growing artificial intelligence (AI) market, to reduce their dependence on crypto, JPMorgan (JPM) said in a research report Wednesday. The cost of the new investments has been funded in part by miners selling coins in recent quarters, the report said. Some bitcoin mining firms have rebranded to reflect the diversification, with Hive Blockchain Technologies (HIVE) becoming Hive Digital Technologies, and Riot Blockchain (RIOT) changing its name to Riot Platforms.  Chart of the day  The chart shows ether call-put skews, which measure the cost of calls relative to puts.  Negative prints indicate a bias for puts, derivativecontracts offering protection against price drops.  The renewed bias for puts comes after prices fell over 8% last week.

42409913,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcQUO7,1692619281,Crypto Analysts Split on Why Ether Outperformed Bitcoin During Last Week's Slide,"The ether-bitcoin (ETH/BTC) ratio rose last week even as the broader market cratered.  One analysts attributed ether's uncanny outperformance with optimism from the potential launch of futures-based ETFs.  Others pointed to a lack of interest in altcoins and hedging activity of market makers.  Last week's market crash saw ether (ETH), the native token of Ethereum's blockchain, take smaller losses than industry leader bitcoin (BTC). Analysts are split on why, given bitcoin is usually the preferred asset during market slides.  While bitcoin fell 10.5% last week, ether lost 8.3%, resulting in a more than 2% gain in the widely tracked ether-bitcoin (ETH) ratio, CoinDesk data show. The crypto market capitalization fell by 8.3% to $1.02 trillion.  The uptick in the ratio seems unusual because investors typically prefer bitcoin, the biggest and the most liquid cryptocurrency, during times of stress. Historically, the ratio has declined during market swoons and rallied during upswings.  This time, optimism about an impending U.S. launch of ether futures-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) likely helped the No. 2 cryptocurrency, according to Noelle Acheson, the author of the Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter.  ETH futures ETF  ""It looks like the ETH market is finally starting to wake up to the likelihood of an ETH futures ETF come October. While this is not as good a product as a spot ETF would be, it is still a convenient way for retail and institutional investors to diversify their crypto exposure, and is likely to drive new inflows into the asset."" Acheson said, explaining the catalyst for ether's outperformance.  Futures-based ETFs issue publicly traded securities that track the price movement of an asset's futures contracts. An ether version would attempt to mimic the crypto's performance just as ProShares' Bitcoin Strategy ETF does for the largest cryptocurrency. Since its inception in October 2021, ProShares' BTC futures-based ETF has closely tracked the spot price, attracting over $2 billion in investor money. Though its considered inferior to a spot-based ETF due to roll costs, it works for anyone looking to take exposure to the cryptocurrency without owning it.  As of now, at least 16 applications for ether futures ETFs or ether-bitcoin futures ETFs are awaiting regulatory approval in the U.S., according to Wall Street Journal.  ""As awareness of the upcoming listings spread, we should start to see interest pick up further,"" Acheson told CoinDesk, adding that more investment could boost Ethereum's on-chain activity, increasing the amount of ETH burned each day. ""This could add a further tailwind to the price, boosting the number of on-chain transactions even further, creating more transaction fees, more (ETH) burns, more supply reduction, and so on.""  Lack of interest in altcoins  Meanwhile, Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at crypto services provider Matrixport, said bitcoin's bigger decline mainly stems from a lack of interest in ether and other coins.  ""As the crypto market has become rather illiquid, with several market makers stepping away from crypto and exchanges have removed zero-fee trading, the larger players have focused on bitcoin instead of trading the illiquid altcoins. This is why bitcoin underperformed when the market crashed last week,"" Thielen told CoinDesk.  Liquidity, or the ability of the market to absorb large orders at stable prices, has deteriorated significantly since the collapse of Sam Bankman Fried's FTX exchange last November. The situation has worsened since the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission cited several altcoins as securities in its lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase. Altcoin liquidity on U.S.-based exchanges has declined to around $20 million from $32 million in November, according to Paris-based Kaiko.  Low liquidity means high slippage – the difference between the price at which a trading order is executed and the price at which it was requested. Therefore, big traders may have stayed away from altcoins this year.  Market makers arrested ETH's drop  Lastly, according to Griffin Ardern, volatility trader from crypto asset management firm Blofin, the hedging activity of ETH options market makers was mainly responsible for ether's outperformance.  ""For BTC, I think market makers' hedging contributed to the price drop, but for ETH, it was a key factor that prevented the price from falling sharply,"" Ardern said. ""ETH had solid positive gamma near the strike price of around $1,600, and its total gamma is still positive, which means that when the price falls, market makers are buyers rather than sellers.""  Market makers are entities responsible for creating order book liquidity. They trade against market direction when gamma is positive, thereby arresting price swings.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,ALTCOIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/08/21/crypto-analysts-split-on-why-ether-outperformed-bitcoin-during-last-weeks-slide,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9479bce6b0c7bac678ebf4b4692b8ed6912e2b51-2992x1683.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

16334295,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=548210,1692619204,How High Can Shiba Inu (SHIB) Rise When Shibarium Restarts?,"Shibarium, the much-anticipated layer-2 network of Shiba Inu is back online but remains under the radar, confined to an extensive private test phase. Shytoshi Kusama, the project’s lead developer, unveiled this update on Saturday. In his remarks, Kusama assured the community that they have resolved all technical challenges previously encountered on this layer-2 platform. Kusama mentioned, “Shibarium is currently live (but in private mode) producing blocks as normal.” He further emphasized the importance of ensuring optimal scaling and functionality before a public re-release, suggesting that the SHIB development team is prioritizing caution above all. Notably, Shibarium’s initial launch wasn’t without its issues. Block production had come to a standstill on the network just last week. Shibariumscan, the network’s designated explorer, indicates that the most recent block on the Shibarium mainnet was produced on Thursday. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Whale Transfers 4.6 Trillion Tokens After A 24-Hour Safekeeping However, among the many challenges faced, the most significant was the unexpected trapping of 965 ETH, valued approximately at $1.7 million during that period. The predicament arose because of the massive, unexpected influx of traffic on the network immediately post-launch, with 1000 ETH tokens and 600,000 BONE tokens deposited within the first 15 minutes alone. This rush resulted in Shibarium recording over 160 million compute units in merely half an hour. Kusama, providing a silver lining, stated that they’ve since amplified Shibarium’s scaling and capacity by a staggering 1,500%. With such promising advancements and the dedication shown by the team, many Shiba Inu enthusiasts are ardently waiting for Shibarium to open its gates to the public. How High Can Shiba Inu Surge Post Shibarium Restart? The ripples of the Shibarium launch and its subsequent hiccups are vividly evident in SHIB’s recent price dynamics. A euphoric surge was observed around August 12, where SHIB’s price ascended to a 4-month high at $0.00001134. However, post the Shibarium’s temporary freeze, SHIB’s value plummeted sharply. This decline was so drastic that SHIB’s price slid below the support levels of all major daily moving averages. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Shows Resilience As Shibarium Reboots: SHIB Price Targets The meme coin’s recent trajectory saw it dwindling precariously close to the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement mark at $0.00000717 just last Thursday. However, SHIB price managed to claw its way back, finding support above the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level pegged at $0.00000806. A brief bounce was witnessed, but resistance at the 50% Fibonacci retracement level and the 100-day EMA at $0.00000869 thwarted its progress, causing it to retrace its steps back towards the 61.8% level. With the potential public restart of Shibarium on the horizon, there’s a beacon of hope for SHIB’s price. A successful relaunch might propel SHIB to soar by 37% and retouch its 4-month peak at $0.00001134. But this ascent won’t be without challenges. The Shiba Inu price will need to navigate a maze of resistance, most notably the area between the 100-day EMA at $0.00000867 and the 50% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.00000869, the area between the 200-day EMA at $0.00000932 and the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.00000931, and the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.00001009.

However, an interesting turn of events has unfolded as the coin found solace at a crucial support trendline coinciding with the psychological level of $0.5. This fortuitous alignment has offered XRP bulls a potential launching pad for a counteroffensive, raising questions about the possibility of a recovery. The value of XRP soared after a groundbreaking legal verdict that classified the token as not being a security in the protracted legal feud involving Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission. This decision initially propelled XRP to higher valuation grounds, signaling optimism among investors.

Boosted By Legal Victory, Subdued By Capital Outflow The decline in XRP’s market capitalization can be attributed to an amalgamation of influences. Notably, traders who benefited from the initial surge in prices opted to take profits, inducing a downward pressure on the coin’s value. The inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market also played a role in amplifying these fluctuations. Additionally, lingering apprehensions surrounding the regulatory outlook of XRP’s long-term status added to the uncertainty, potentially dissuading potential buyers from committing to the coin. XRP reached a market cap of $27.6 billion today. Chart: TradingView.com XRP: Path To Recovery As the market assesses the course ahead for XRP, technical analysis offers insights into potential inflection points. To dismantle the impact of the previous price breakdown, buyers are looking to breach the $0.5948 high achieved on August 17. Such a breakthrough would disarm sellers and could provide the momentum needed to drive the price toward recovery. In this scenario, with the current price of XRP at $0.534, XRP’s journey could see a resurgence towards $0.667, followed by aspirational targets of $0.854 and $0.933. XRP seven-day price action.

Some bitcoin mining firms have rebranded to reflect the diversification, with Hive Blockchain Technologies (HIVE) becoming Hive Digital Technologies, and Riot Blockchain (RIOT) changing its name to Riot Platforms.  It’s not just miners of the world’s largest cryptocurrency, bitcoin, that are looking for new revenue streams. Former ether (ETH) miners have also shown a tendency to offer HPC services, the bank said, noting that since the Ethereum blockchain Merge, there has been a high supply of graphics processing units (GPUs) for sale in the secondary market because GPUs used for ether mining “lost their utility.”  Some ether miners sold their GPUs to salvage their investment, while some repurposed their machines for gaming, image and video rendering services, and mining other proof-of-work cryptocurrencies such as ethereum classic (ETC), ravencoin (RVN) and ergo (ERG), the note said.  “However, mining these cryptocurrencies were not as profitable as mining ether due to their lower market caps and questions about their long-term viability,” analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote.  “With the rapid growth of AI, the increased demand for high performance computing is now opening a new and perhaps more profitable avenue for utilizing GPUs previously used for ether mining,” the analysts wrote.  Bitcoin miners are also trying to diversify in terms of geography, with Russia emerging as one of the global leaders second to the U.S., in terms of bitcoin mining power consumption, the report added.

16331189,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/us-federal-court-denies-appeal-to-lift-tornado-cash-sanctions,1692613500,US Federal Court Denies Appeal To Lift Tornado Cash Sanctions,"US District Judge Robert Pitman has dismissed an appeal filed by six Tornado Cash users who sought to lift sanctions placed on the controversial cryptocurrency mixer. The United States Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control had added Tornado Cash to its SDN list in August 2022, alleging it had enabled billions in illicit funds. Court Upholds Treasury Department’s Sanctions A federal court has upheld the Treasury Department’s decision to impose sanctions on cryptocurrency mixer Tornado Cash, throwing out the legal challenge brought by several users of the mixing service. The judge sided with the government and the Treasury Department on all of its claims and also granted summary judgment in the case. This reinforced the fact that the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control is entitled to sanction Tornado Cash under current sanction statutes. Furthermore, the court denied the summary judgment requested by the plaintiffs. The court filing stated, “The Court finds that Tornado Cash is an association within the ordinary meaning of the term and is, therefore, an entity that may be designated per OFAC regulations.” The Plaintiff’s Argument The plaintiffs in the case, six users of Tornado Cash, had stated that the government’s action to sanction the cryptocurrency mixer was unlawful because it violated the first amendment. The plaintiffs argued that because of the decision, they were being denied the ability to engage in socially valuable speech. This is because they would have used Tornado Cash to donate to several social and political causes. However, Judge Pitman disagreed with this argument, stating that the plaintiffs had failed to show that the action taken by the government had, in any way, implicated the first amendment. The plaintiffs also pointed out that there is significant confusion regarding what Tornado Cash really is, stating, “The parties disagree on how to characterize Tornado Cash. Plaintiffs contend that Tornado Cash is a decentralized, open-source software project comprised of a subset of smart contracts, or “pools,” on the Ethereum blockchain.” The plaintiffs also argued against classifying Tornado Cash as an association, claiming that the designation would exclude individual founders, developers, DAO members, and users involved in supporting the application. The plaintiffs asserted that Tornado Cash users rely on smart contracts that are immutable, autonomous, and self-executing. If Tornado Cash was recognized as an autonomous software instead of an association, it would be exempted from the SDN requirements. The OFAC has classified Tornado Cash as an entity that operates a cryptocurrency mixing service. It has also stated that the service was being used to launder virtual currencies, including those by the dreaded hacker group Lazarus. “OFAC determined that the DPRK’s malicious cyber-enabled activities threaten the United States and the broader international community and pose a significant threat to the international financial system. OFAC also observed that the DPRK has increasingly relied on cybercrime to generate revenue for its weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs.” Court Disagrees With Plaintiffs Judge Pitman concluded that Tornado Cash operates as an association and hence, can be sanctioned by the authorities as an entity under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The judge also determined that smart contracts deployed by Tornado Cash were subject to sanctions under regulatory definitions outlined by the OFAC. Interestingly, the judge also noted that the plaintiffs could have made a case stating that their inability to access Ethereum trapped in Tornado Cash smart contract pools violated the fifth amendment. The fifth amendment guarantees protection against the taking of any property by the government without fair compensation. However, the judge noted that the plaintiffs did not pursue their fifth amendment claim. “Plaintiffs did not pursue their Fifth Amendment claim, even after the government raised the issue of waiver in its cross-motion. Because Plaintiffs failed to pursue their Fifth Amendment claim, they have waived it.” Coinbase Backing Lawsuit The chief legal officer at Coinbase, Paul Grewal, stated that the exchange continues to believe in the plaintiffs’ challenge against the OFAC action and that the issues require Fifth Circuit appellate review. Coinbase is also backing the lawsuit. “We continue to believe Plaintiffs’ challenge to OFAC’s Tornado Cash action is right. We’ve always known that Fifth Circuit review is required to resolve these issues, and we continue to support them on appeal.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The Bitcoin Ordinal’s domination comes despite the fact that Bitcoin’s price has seen a considerable decrease and suggestions that the hype around Bitcoin NFTs may have taken a back seat. Ordinals Continue To Dominate Bitcoin Network On the 21st of August, Bitcoin Ordinals developer Leonidas took to X (formerly Twitter) to highlight that Bitcoin had around 530,788 transactions over the past 24 hours. Leonidas stated that out of this number, 450,785 were transactions that were related to Ordinals. Leonidas stated in their post, “Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin had 530,788 transactions. 450,785 of those transactions were Ordinals related. In the midst of everyone claiming “Ordinals are dead,” they have literally accounted for 84.9% of the activity on Bitcoin. You can’t make this stuff up.” Data from Dune Analytics backed up the trend, with the platform reporting that the 20th of August saw over 400,000 Ordinal inscriptions. Meanwhile, data sourced from Bitinfocharts reported a daily Bitcoin transaction count of around 556,000. According to these numbers, over three-quarters of activity on the 20th of August on the Bitcoin network was related to Ordinals. “85% of on-chain bitcoin transactions in the past 24 hours are ordinals related EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT the main use case of the bitcoin chain is ORDINALS.” According to industry researcher Eric Wall, the past week saw 54% of the transactions on the Bitcoin network were Ordinals or related to Ordinals. Data sourced from Dune Analytics has shown that there have been a total of 25.5 million Ordinals inscriptions, which have generated over $53 million in fees on the Bitcoin network. Currently, BRC-20 token minting dominates inscriptions, with over 1.9 million of them mined during the previous week. Numbers In Stark Contrast To DappRadar Report These figures and claims are in stark contrast to a report published by DappRadar on the 17th of August. The report claimed that Ordinals NFT usage and sales volume had registered an “alarming plunge,” and trading volume had tanked by a staggering 98% since peaking in May. DappRadar showed its data which showed that the total Bitcoin Ordinals sales volume had dropped from a peak of $452 million in May to around $3 million as of the 14th of August. It described the scenario as “grim” for the larger Ordinals market. However, it also emphasized that it would need more time to determine if the situation was a temporary setback or a systemic problem with Bitcoin-based NFTs. The report stated, “This steep decline in both sales volume and count within such a short period is alarming for Bitcoin Ordinals. The diminishing sales count underscores the waning enthusiasm or perhaps confidence in Bitcoin NFT. While fluctuations in sales volume could be attributed to market dynamics, a consistent decline in transaction count may point toward broader issues. It suggests that fewer traders are engaging with Bitcoin Ordinals, which could raise concerns about its longevity and relevance in the NFT space.” However, many have pointed out that the DappRadar report looked at the sales and trading volume of those NFTs that were minted on the Bitcoin network. However, it did not look at the actual inscription activity, which they pointed out was very high. A Divided Community DappRadar suggests in its report that a key issue regarding the sustainability of Ordinals is that the Bitcoin community is split down the middle on whether NFTs should even be on the Bitcoin network or not. This is not an issue when it comes to blockchains such as Ethereum, which has a thriving NFT community. According to DappRadar, many in the Bitcoin community view Bitcoin as “digital gold” and that its primary function is that of a store of value. The report added, “There are voices within the community that view Bitcoin primarily as ‘digital gold,’ suggesting that its primary function should remain as a store of value. On the other hand, Ethereum is often referred to as ‘digital oil,’ indicating its role in fueling the digital economy. The coming months will be crucial in determining whether Bitcoin finds a foothold in the ever-evolving NFT landscape or reverts to its primary role as a store of value.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The jump in 24-hour fees places it in the top three projects for fee generation, only behind Ethereum and Lido, according to data from DeFiLlama. A Significant Jump In Fees With the protocol fees generated over the past 24 hours exceeding $1.4 million, Friend.tech has surpassed several prominent blockchain projects when it comes to fees generated. This includes projects such as Tron and Uniswap. Currently, the project sits only behind Ethereum and Lido Finance, according to data sourced from DeFiLlama. Data also shows that the recorded fees for the protocol for the last week were $2.99 million, out of which $1.49 was revenue. Friend.tech is a social app that operates on Coinbase’s Base Layer-2 chain. The social app is integrated with platforms such as X (formerly Twitter), allowing users to trade tokenized shares directly in one another’s social profiles. Shareholders get plenty of unique perks, such as excluding access to content and access to private chat rooms. Friends.tech has only recently gained considerable traction among Twitter users. As a result, the protocol has seen a bevy of new, high-profile members join over the weekend. Prominent new joinees include NBA star Grayson Allen and startup incubator Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan. $26 Million In Volume Since Launch Since the platform’s beta release, Friend.tech has managed to record over 65,000 unique traders of shares, resulting in over $26 million in trading volume. These figures have been backed up by data sourced from a Dune Analytics dashboard created by Crypto Koryo. Friend.tech’s stellar rise to the third position among projects when it comes to 24-hour fees is even more significant when you consider the fact that the platform is currently available and accessible on an invite-only basis. Friend.tech also recently revealed a seed investment from venture capital firm Paradigm. However, the protocol did not disclose the exact amount of the investment from Paradigm. Friend.tech shared some details on X, stating, “Earlier this year, we partnered with @paradigm to build tools for new online social interactions. We’re grateful for the community’s warm reception and excited to continue growing with you all.” Critics Not Convinced While a majority of crypto heavyweights have been extremely bullish about the decentralized social media app, some critics remain unconvinced and have advised caution. Crypto commentator Yazan highlighted several factors that, according to him, indicated that the app had between six to eight weeks before share prices and general activity on the platform registered a significant drop. Yazan stated, “Let me tell you one thing. Something isn’t right about @friendtech. Creators making money from a group chat that doesn’t even work when you can’t even reply directly to people? The way pricing works is ridiculous and can be easily taken advantage of. Pumps and dumps.” He also argued that the rate at which the share prices have increased is unsustainable. “The market making that guarantees that the app makes the most money along with creators — the price goes up too fast. How come there’s 100 holders, and the price is 1 ETH — 1 ETH to be able to see a private chat?” Meanwhile, in a thread on X, the pseudo-anonymous software engineer Cygaar stated that the price of a user’s shares on the app is proportional to the square of its outstanding supply. This means that as supply increased, the price increased exponentially. Web3 marketer Legendary drew comparisons with BitClout, a decentralized social app launched in 2021 that gave a bearish outlook regarding Friend.tech’s longevity. He stated that the platform would eventually collapse like BitClout did. “I think the platform will collapse as BitClout did. We are in a bear market, and there’s nothing to do. Everyone jumps on an opportunity to make money, but I think the platform will be done within the next weeks to months.” However, some have shared a far more positive outlook and have praised the decentralized social media app for its novel developments in UX when it came to crypto applications. The co-founder of Jokerace and EcoDAO, David Phelps, called Friend. tech’s UX as the “greatest UX crypto has seen.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

16330230,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=548191,1692611703,Experts Explain Why SEC’s Interlocutory Appeal In Ripple Case Was A Mistake,"The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently filed an interlocutory appeal following Judge Analisa Torres’ ruling in favor of Ripple. However, an attorney and crypto enthusiast Greg Beuke believes the SEC made a mistake in appealing the decision. SEC Misunderstood Judge Torres’ Ruling Reacting to the news that the SEC had filed a motion to certify an interlocutory appeal, Beuke stated that the regulator “fundamentally misunderstands” the ruling. According to him, the Judge didn’t rule programmatic sales cannot constitute investment contracts. Related Reading: Ethereum Whale Avoids Market Crash, Do They Know Something You Don’t? He explained that Judge Torres only ruled that programmatic sales didn’t constitute investment contracts in this particular case because the SEC failed to establish that XRP investors who bought over exchanges did so, hoping they would profit from Ripple’s efforts. The SEC also failed to adduce any significant evidence to bolster its case. Beuke highlighted that the agency didn’t provide any “single XRP holder” who said he expected to profit from Ripple’s venture despite that being the basis of the SEC’s argument. Instead, it relied on “cherry picked statements from Ripple & select employees,” which the attorney believes was inadequate to discharge the burden of proof placed on the SEC. Beuke further called the SEC’s move of an interlocutory appeal a “huge strategic mistake.” Usually, a party appealing a final ruling can interpret it in a way that bolsters its argument without the Judge who gave the ruling being able to clarify why it made such a judgment. However, in this case, the SEC filed an interlocutory appeal (an appeal before a final order is made) which allows Judge Torres to clarify her ruling and probably put a dent in the SEC’s case, as Beuke argues. He believes that the Judge will make it clear that the SEC failed to discharge its burden of proof. XRP price continues to decline | Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com SEC To Lose Its Appeal In Ripple Case? Beuke pointed out that no new evidence can be adduced upon appeal, and neither can the SEC make new arguments. As such, the 2nd circuit will only have the records to work with, and going by it, the regulator provided little or no evidence to prove its case. Related Reading: The $200 Million BNB Bridge Exploiter Just Got Liquidated On Venus While the appeal court might be inclined to accept the SEC’s underlying argument that XRP’s programmatic sales did indeed constitute an investment contract, Beuke has stated the court will avert its mind to Judge Torres’ ruling, which was based “on the undisputed factual record,” which shows that the SEC failed to prove its case. The SEC is likely to lose as it was expected to prove that a “reasonable retail XRP purchaser was aware of Ripple and relied on Ripple’s efforts for profits.” Furthermore, Ripple seems to have a more solid case as the SEC had no reply to affidavits of XRP holders, which prominent XRP lawyer John Deaton brought forward.

As of Asian afternoon hours, the bitcoin (BTC) price remained steady at over $26,000, with ether (ETH) little changed from Sunday’s $1,670. Xrp (XRP) lost some 2% while litecoin (LTC) rose 2%. The two were the only ones among majors to buck a flat-market trend.  Meme coin shiba inu (SHIB) slid 2%, increasing losses to more than 21% in the past week following the botched launch of its Ethereum layer 2 network Shibarium. Transactions stalled in the hours after the network went live last Wednesday, with over $1.7 million worth of tokens in a bridge, or a tool used to transfer tokens between two blockchains, said to be stuck owing to a bug in the code.

16331605,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/bitget-to-introduce-kyc-by-september-2023,1692608400,Bitget To Introduce KYC by September 2023,"Bitget, the prominent cryptocurrency trading platform, has recently announced a significant change in its user policy, to take effect by September 2023. The platform will make it mandatory for its users to complete KYC verification. Regulators across the world are exerting pressure on all centralised crypto exchange platforms to conform to regulatory requirements, and KYC (know your customer) is one of the most basic of these requirements. Bitget’s decision is seen as an effort to align with global regulatory standards and increase the security measures on the platform. By ensuring all users are KYC-verified, Bitget aims to establish a safer trading environment and curtail potential misuse or illicit activities. According to a Bitget support post on the subject on its Announcement Centre, all newly signed-up users are obliged to complete a level 1 KYC verification requirement. Users signed up before this date have to complete this same requirement by 1 October 2023. This mandatory KYC verification is also expected to provide a safeguard against fraudulent accounts, ensuring a more transparent and accountable trading environment. Such rigorous measures reflect Bitget's dedication to prioritising user safety and compliance, all while striving to uphold the platform’s reputation in the crypto community. Moreover, the move is in sync with the broader trend in the cryptocurrency industry, where regulatory compliance is increasingly becoming a focal point. Many platforms are now adopting robust verification processes to meet the regulatory demands of different jurisdictions, with Bitget's announcement further cementing this trend. A contrary view However, some exchange users will feel that they need to protect their identity when trading crypto, for all sorts of reasons. After all, crypto did grow out of a distrust of the banking system and of the regulators that many believe are just there to perpetuate the continuation of the current traditional financial system. Decentralisation is the key to this endeavour, and the race is on for the current so-called decentralised exchanges to really up their game and strengthen their protocols such that anyone can trade without cost-increasing and slow middlemen getting in the way. Crypto should be about ultra-fast and efficient finance and not central planners attempting to control and smother. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The coin, which had dropped below the $220 mark on August 18, experienced fluctuations between the narrow range of $213 to $220 over the course of the weekend. As of the latest update, CoinGecko reported the current BNB price at $216, marking a 0.3% decline over the past 24 hours and a significant seven-day slump of 10%. Related Reading: Hedera (HBAR) Rises As Weekend’s Top 50 Sole Gainer With 14% Rally Binance Coin (BNB) price action today. Source: Coingecko The past year has been marked by significant challenges for BNB, largely attributed to the regulatory uncertainties surrounding its parent company, Binance. The situation escalated in June when the US Securities and Exchange Commission categorized BNB and its sibling token, Binance USD (BUSD) stablecoin, as securities within the context of its lawsuit against the cryptocurrency exchange. Despite vehement opposition from Binance and the exchange’s chief, the impact on BNB’s demand has been evident, with cautious investors steering clear of assets entangled in regulatory ambiguities. Binance Coin Market Dynamics And CEO’s Stance Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao recently took to the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to address growing speculation that Binance was proactively shoring up BNB’s price to prevent it from dipping below $212. CZ refuted these claims, asserting that BNB’s price was, in fact, shaped by market forces. He challenged the notion of artificial price support and emphasized that the coin’s valuation was ultimately determined by its interaction with the open market. This declaration marked an attempt to alleviate concerns that the exchange was manipulating the token’s price. And where did the $212 magic number come from? #BNB price is determined by the market. A $30m re-buy is less than 4% of a single day’s volume. 🤷‍♂️ — CZ 🔶 Binance (@cz_binance) August 19, 2023 On-Chain Activity And DeFi’s Influence The decline in BNB’s price can also be attributed to diminished on-chain activity on the Binance Smart Chain, a prominent layer1 smart contract blockchain. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) activities have experienced a significant contraction, with the weekly exchange volume plummeting from its peak of $24.70 billion to a mere $2.34 billion, as per DeFillama data.

The 30-day correlation coefficient between bitcoin and the 10-year U.S. inflation-indexed security turned negative this month, declining from +0.28 to -0.72, a level last seen in April, according to charting platform TradingView. A reading of 1 implies assets are moving in lockstep, and -1 suggests the opposite.  The current reading indicates the renewed influence of traditional finance and macro factors on the bitcoin price. The negative correlation broke down in July amid optimism over the possible approval of a spot ETF.  Treasury inflation-indexed securities are indexed to inflation – the non-seasonally adjusted U.S. city average of all items consumer price index for all urban consumers. The Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes the data. The yield on these securities is called real or inflation-adjusted yield.  When real yields are negative, investors tend to seek returns from high-risk alternatives like technology stocks and cryptocurrencies, as we saw in the year following the coronavirus-induced crash of March 2020. When real yields are positive and rising, investors feel encouraged to invest in fixed-income securities.  The yield on the 10-year U.S. inflation-indexed security rose to 1.97% last week, the highest since February 2009.  Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, fell over 10%, registering its most significant weekly decline since early November. Gold, known to have an inverse relationship with real yields, fell more than 1%, its fourth straight weekly decline, and Nasdaq dropped 2.22%.

Lido, however, made lower revenues at $154,000, making Friend.tech the biggest revenue generator among crypto services.  Such growth has come in a very short time, even for crypto’s fast-moving standards.

16326206,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=548163,1692603910,Bitcoin Weekly Chart Completes Double Top: Market Shifts Ahead?,"In the wake of the recent crash in Bitcoin’s price, analysts have been rife with speculation about the market’s next steps. The BTC price briefly dipped to a low of $24,800 last week, and with the Bitcoin fear and greed index plunging from neutral to 38 (indicating fear), market sentiment is palpable. Renowned analyst Rekt Capital weighed in on the situation, offering a thorough technical breakdown. “BTC is officially at the base of the double top. The double top has completed,” states Rekt Capital. Highlighting the market’s current vulnerability, the analyst continues, “Downside wicking below ~$26,000 like in mid-June will occur. But a Weekly Close below ~$260,00 is what would validate the double top and start breakdown continuation.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces A Weekly Double Top; This Needs To Happen Though the double top’s completion has ratcheted up bearish sentiment, there’s no definitive breakdown yet. “BTC has completed the double top but still no breakdown confirmation as BTC holds ~$26k support,” Rekt Capital adds. The scenario becomes even more intriguing as “seller volume has increased in recent days.” The analysis reveals that the “seller volume would need to increase by about +30%” to match the sell-side volume Bitcoin saw during previous price reversals. Drawing attention to Bitcoin’s volume dynamics, Rekt Capital elucidates, “BTC formed its higher high at ~$31,000 on inclining volume. But price formed the second half of its double top on declining volume.” Even though there was a spike in selling volume during the recent crash, it remains far from the seller exhaustion volume levels seen during previous BTC reversals. As the analyst starkly puts it, the current “seller volume would need to probably double” to mirror the levels that triggered price turnarounds in March and June. Remarkably, yesterday’s weekly close saw Bitcoin failing to retain support above key bull market moving averages, including the 21-week EMA, 50-week EMA, and 200-week MA. “All of these bullish momentum indicators were confirmed as lost support with the weekly close yesterday,” the analysis points out. How Low Will Bitcoin Price Drop? In terms of future projections, Rekt Capital speculates that if the double top’s base at $26,000 is lost, it could propel a move towards $22,000. The analyst elucidates that “if we see a weekly close below $26,000, followed by a rejection from $26,000, then we probably see a confirmed breakdown from this double top.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Bulls Beware: Sub $20,000 Nightmare Looms, Analyst Foresees Extended Downturn However, every bearish note comes with a caveat. Rekt Capital adds, “It’s really easy to get caught up in bearish euphoria… So it’s really important not to get caught in these downside wicks (below $26,000).” And for those seeking potential bullish scenarios, the analyst has one in mind: “Even if we break down from this double top… one of the main areas is this inverse head and shoulders formation that we saw play out earlier this year.” A retest of this pattern’s neckline, roughly around $24,000, could spell bullish prospects for the premier cryptocurrency. Historical data also lends a hand in making sense of Bitcoin’s trajectory. “A drawdown of 18% to $24,000 would be totally normal for an August month,” the analyst shares, reminding investors that Bitcoin has often underperformed in August. Drawing parallels with 2015, Rekt Capital argues that Bitcoin also approached a halving and lost 18% in August, suggesting that history might repeat, especially with the next halving anticipated in April of the coming year. At press time, the BTC price was at $26,069.

42409929,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcQUrs,1692602309,"Scheduled Unlocks for LDO, AVAX, YGG Tokens Promise Busy Week Ahead","Liquid staking protocol Lido (LDO), the Avalanche Blockchain native token (AVAX) and the token behind the Yield Guild Games DAO (YGG) are all scheduled to implement unlocks this week, increasing the supply of the tokens available in the market.  Token unlocks are staggered releases of coins previously frozen to prevent early investors or project team members from liquidating their holdings in large numbers.  Lido DAO (LDO) Unlock  The governance token for the liquid staking platform Lido is scheduled to unlock 8.5 million LDO tokens on Aug. 26, valued at $14.2 million, and equating to roughly 0.97% of the supply.  All 8.5 million tokens will be distributed to investors, who already hold more than 300 million tokens, according to TokenUnlocks.  Lido’s LDO token has declined 8.5% during the last week, and has been relatively stable in the last 24 hours, according to CoinDesk data.  Avalanche Token (AVAX) Unlock  AVAX, the native crypto of the Avalanche blockchain, has an unlock scheduled for Saturday, Aug. 26, where it will release 9.54 million AVAX tokens worth $102.86 million, amounting to 2.77% of the total circulating supply.  The last unlock AVAX went through in May and was relatively well received by the market.  “Token unlocks freak people out in general, but the upcoming Avalanche unlock has been mapped out for a while now and most sophisticated actors have adjusted for it,” Lindsey Winder, CEO of token infrastructure firm Hedgey Finance, said to CoinDesk in May.  AVAX's unlock will be split between the strategic partners, who get 2.25 million, or $24.21 million worth, the Foundation, which gets 1.67 million tokens, the team, which is allocated 4.5 million tokens, or $48.42 million, and airdrop participants who get 1.13 million tokens.  AVAX is down 13% during the last week, according to CoinDesk market data, and is down 1.8% on-day.  Yield Guild Games (YGG) Token Unlock  Blockchain-based gaming has been struggling to catch on with mainstream audiences, and Yield Guild Games, a key investor in GameFi’s, DAO token has certainly been reflecting this.  Market data shows that YGG’s token is down nearly 59% in the last year, despite a rally in the last month which temporarily brought it up 49%. During the last week it lost an additional 30% of its value, and is down 2% on-day.  YGG is scheduled to release 12.2 million YGG ($2.87 million) on Sunday, totaling 6.6% of the cryptocurrency's circulating supply. Currently, about 30% of the token’s supply has been unlocked.  Token Unlocks and Market Prices  Just how much do unlocks impact market prices?  The answer is complicated.  Although often considered bearish, the effect of token unlocks on market trends is nuanced, as CoinDesk reported in July.  Analytics firm The Tie studied over 350,000 unlock events and found that on average, coins declined in the lead-up to the event.  However, when the liquidity freed up amounted to more than 100% of the average daily volume, prices quickly rebounded before falling again within two weeks.  This pattern suggests that holders might wait before selling into the market, possibly in response to initial relief that the market was not flooded with new tokens.",NEUTRAL,AVAX | LDO,AVAX | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | LDO,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/08/21/scheduled-unlocks-for-ldo-avax-ygg-tokens-promise-busy-week-ahead,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7f86ab2f96746bc4a978fc2e229b5296c12f723b-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Despite criticizing the U.S. Trustee as the ""sole objector to the Motion"" seeking to ""inject itself into a routine settlement process that is already adequately safeguarded by two different creditor committees,"" the FTX debtors said they were proposing revisions in an effort to address the concerns.  The latest proposal will see the debtors include the U.S. Trustee as a noticed party and reduce the maximum settled value for claims covered by the procedures from the earlier $10 million to $7 million. Debtors will also file monthly reports of executed settlements. Any objections from the ""noticed parties"" would need to be resolved or settled through an order of the court before the claim process can go through.  The two creditor committees are the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors and the ad hoc committee of international customers.  The U.S. Trustee had objected to the earlier motion saying $10 million is far too high to constitute a “small” claim without even providing adequate notice as to the nature of the claims.

16313488,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=548153,1692587770,Bitcoin Price Consolidates Losses and At Risk of Fresh Decline To $25K,"Bitcoin price is consolidating losses below the $26,500 level. BTC is showing bearish signs and remains at risk of a fresh decline toward $25,000. Bitcoin is struggling to recover above the $26,600 resistance zone. The price is trading below $26,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a short-term bullish trend line forming with support near $26,050 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could continue to move down and trade below the $26,000 support. Bitcoin Price Turns Red Bitcoin price started a recovery wave from the $24,800 support zone. BTC managed to recover above the $25,000 and $25,500 resistance levels. There was a move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $29,180 swing high to the $24,800 low. However, the price is facing a lot of hurdles on the upside near $26,600. It is still trading below $26,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. Besides, there is a short-term bullish trend line forming with support near $26,050 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. If Bitcoin stays above the trend line, it could attempt a recovery wave. Immediate resistance is near the $26,400 level. The next major resistance is near $26,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. A clear move above the 100 hourly Simple moving average could start a recovery wave toward the $27,000 resistance. Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com The 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $29,180 swing high to the $24,800 low is near $27,000 to act as a resistance. A close above the $27,000 resistance could start a decent increase toward the $27,500 resistance zone. Any more gains might set the pace for a larger increase toward $28,150. Another Decline In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to clear the $26,500 resistance, it could continue to move down. Immediate support on the downside is near the $26,000 zone and the trend line. The next major support is near the $25,600 level. A downside break below the $25,600 level might push the price further into a bearish zone. In the stated case, the price could drop toward $25,000. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now below the 50 level.
