42413591,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl9vxe,1669588096,First Mover Asia: Dogecoin Surges 16% to Continue Its Holiday Cheer,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Dogecoin soared more than 16% over the past 24 hours and is up more than 50% since last Tuesday.  Insights: Ethereum Name service selects Karpatkey DAO to manage Its endowment fund  Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 848.15 +6.7 ▲ 0.8% Bitcoin (BTC) $16,577 +85.1 ▲ 0.5% Ethereum (ETH) $1,216 +8.3 ▲ 0.7% S&P 500 daily close  4,026.12 −1.1 ▼ 0.0% Gold  $1,755 +10.1 ▲ 0.6% Treasury Yield 10 Years  3.69% ▼ 0.0 BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices; gold is COMEX spot price. Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Dogecoin Surges; Other Cryptos Trade Flat  By James Rubin  On a quiet holiday weekend in cryptocurrency markets, DOGE made some noise.  The popular meme coin soared 16% over the previous 24 hours and was trading at more than 10 cents. DOGE has risen nearly 50% since last Monday with most of its gains occurring during U.S. Thanksgiving holiday celebrations, which started on Thursday. The reasons for the spike were difficult to pinpoint, although social media influencer David Gokhshtein mused to his more than 700,000 Twitter followers on Thursday about the possibility of new Twitter boss Elon Musk and Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin working together on DOGE improvement.  ""I feel that we’ll all see Vitalik and Elon working together to somehow upgrade $DOGE,"" Gokhshstein wrote.  Investors fretting another post FTX-related price plunge in crypto markets could otherwise take heart at bitcoin's resilience, although the largest cryptocurrency's ability to hold its perch over $16,000 for yet another few days hardly suggests a more permanent upturn is approaching, a number of analysts have said. BTC was recently trading at about $16,500, roughly flat for the past 24 hours and about where it stood Wednesday when the U.S. began its Thanksgiving holiday celebrations.  ""It's trying to stabilize around the $15,500-$17,000 region and weather the storm but I'm not sure it will be that easy,"" wrote Craig Erlam, senior market analyst for foreign exchange market maker Oanda.  Traditional markets were closed on Thursday and stock trading the following day was light as many businesses closed, including major financial services firms. The calm extended to crypto markets.  Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency in market value, was recently changing hands at about $1,200, roughly flat from Saturday, same time and about where it stood as Thursday dawned. Aside from DOGE, most cryptos in the CoinDesk top 20 also traded sideways, although XLM recently rose more than 3%. The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, was up about 1%.  Oanda's Erlam was less than sanguine about crypto markets as the fallout widens from crypto exchange FTX's implosion earlier this month.  ""There's likely more to come from the FTX collapse and the contagion effects, not to mention potentially other scandals that could be uncovered,"" Erlam wrote. ""This may continue to make crypto traders very nervous and leave the foundations supporting price extremely shaky.""

Young  The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) has chosen a new fund manager to take charge in managing its treasury in the wake of crypto winter.  In a vote that opened Nov. 17 and closed on Nov. 22, community members selected Karpatkey DAO, a decentralized finance (DeFi) fund management organization originally incubated through Gnosis Ltd.  Karpatkey received 1.76 million votes. Notable addresses that picked Karpatkey include ENS co-founder Alex Van de Sande (avsa.eth), founder of Rotkiapp Lefteris Karapetsas (lefteris.eth) and ENS steward Griff Green (griff.eth), who altogether had a voting power of 468K ENS.  “None of the above” came in second place with 1.3 million votes.  Now that the community has chosen Karpatkey, the treasury management firm in collaboration with Steakhouse Financial, going forward, will manage the bulk of ENS’ treasury composed mostly of USDC and ETH. With more than two years of experience, Karpatkey boasts over $397 million of non-custodial assets under management, excluding ENS.  The goal of the endowment fund, called ENS Endaoment, is to create a sustainable fund that can fuel continuous development regardless of macroeconomics conditions that may adversely affect revenue stemming from ENS registrations and renewals. Talks of the ENS Endaoment were happening as early as March before the crises related to Terra, Three Arrows Capital, Celsius Network and FTX, according to Nicholas Johnson, one of three directors for the ENS Foundation, and Mona El Isa, CEO and founder of Avantgarde, one of the potential fund managers up for consideration.  Karpatkey said in its proposal, “The funds would be managed transparently and completely on-chain through a non-custodial solution … The core of Karpatkey’s non-custodial solution relies on the most battle-tested tooling to manage DAO treasuries: a proxy Management Safe and the Zodiac Roles Modifier.”  Zodiac, developed by Gnosis Guild, is “a collection of tools built according to an open standard” as said on its Github page, while Safe, securing close to $40 billion in all its Ethereum contracts, is one of the most popular ways to custody digital assets in a decentralized manner.  $52 million is the initial size of Karpatkey’s proposal for the ENS Endaoment and $69 million with a projected return of 5.83% is the final stage of Karpatkey’s proposal. “The strategy would use low-risk, medium complexity DeFi strategies such as providing liquidity to automated market makers.”  In an interview with CoinDesk, Karpatkey’s business development manager who goes by ""DeFi Foodie"" on Twitter, said, “It’s been a great exchange that has been in the forum, on the diversity of voices, how everybody could just give their opinion openly. And that’s been really healthy for ENS DAO because people can just speak their minds and have civil exchanges. When the forum asks questions [and] challenge[s] points, I think that’s something that is rich for the community and favorable.”  El Isa told CoinDesk that if a fund manager endorses a non-custodial, completely transparent solution, such as Enzyme, Avantgarde's proposal choice for a decentralized asset and treasury management protocol, for the ENS Endaoment, it “would be the first example of something being run completely on-chain”, where a FTX or Bernie Madoff situation “wouldn’t be possible.""

As such, 62% of institutional investors who have crypto exposure boosted their allocations in the past year, and 58% expect to increase their holdings over the next three years despite market turmoil that's persisted for much of 2022, according to a survey conducted between Sept. 21 and Oct. 27 by Institutional Investor Custom Research Lab. Those stats signaled that big-money investors have taken the long-term vision of the emerging asset class, with a belief in its potential to disrupt the much larger traditional financial services industry. In fact, 72% of the respondents said they believe crypto is here to stay, according to the survey, which comprised 140 institutional U.S. investors, representing assets under management of roughly $2.6T. Overall investor sentiment across the digital asset market has certainly been hurt by the recent meltdown of crypto exchange FTX, as well as previous high-profile downfalls (Terra ecosystem, Three Arrows Capital, Celsius) and blockchain-based hacks. On top of that, the space has been dealing with global monetary tightening and economic uncertainty. When asked about their outlook on crypto prices, 83% of investors said they see prices trading range-bound or trend lower in the next year. Still, 71% of them expect asset valuations to increase over the long term. And while the FTX implosion continues to send shockwaves across the crypto ecosystem, some industry players think the space will mature more and keep growing in the longer term, especially as the fallout from FTX triggered increased regulatory scrutiny. The chart below shows the exceptional drawdown that prices of major cryptos have seen in just the past year, with bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) dropping over 71% and cardano ( ADA-USD ) nosediving 82% . Seeking Alpha contributor Pinxter Analytics warned that ""there really isn't a bottom"" for bitcoin, though, since it's not ""backed by anything tangible."" ""We do not believe the digital asset industry has been or could be set back by one 'rogue' player,"" Steve Russell, co-manager at Emerald, told Seeking Alpha in an emailed statement. ""We believe the industry will continue to grow and the adoption of distributed technology, blockchain, stablecoins, and investing in coins and tokens is a multi-year event and this FTX moment while it will be remembered as a 'Lehman' moment."" The survey showed that greater yield opportunities, exposure to innovative (blockchain) technology and potentially long-term appreciation were among the main reasons why institutional investors continued to target the evolving space. Still, most investors (64%) called for more regulatory clarity, which the crypto space lacks a fair amount of, as there's still no singular regulatory regime overseeing the industry. All in all, ""we expect they [institutional investors] will continue to express interest and allocate — even through the short-term cycles — as challenging as they are,"" Brett Tejpaul, vice president of Institutional at Coinbase Global, wrote in response to Institutional Investor's findings. In a rather outspoken view, Cathie Wood reiterated that bitcoin will hit $1M by 2030 .",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/news/3911150-most-institutional-investors-plan-to-boost-crypto-allocation-in-next-three-years-survey?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/4854530.jpeg

The overhead hurdle of $0.32 remains crucial for the altcoin. Today’s global cryptocurrency market cap is $879 billion, with a 0.0% change in the last 24 hours. Related Reading: Uniswap Price Struggles At $5.49, Will There Be A Run Up To $6? Cardano Price Analysis: One-Day Chart ADA was exchanging hands at $0.31 at press time. Over the last 24 hours, Cardano’s price witnessed an increase in buying pressure. Immediate resistance for ADA is awaited at $0.32. After overtaking the aforementioned price mark and flipping it into a support floor, there are chances of ADA appreciating by 18%. Moving above the $0.32 price mark will propel the asset price to $0.36 first and then to $0.38. On the flip side, if ADA cannot break past the $0.31 level, it will cause the coin to fall to $0.29. The amount of Cardano exchanged in the past session was in green, indicating that demand grew for the altcoin. Technical Analysis Since November 26, the coin has registered a slight growth in buyers. The Relative Strength Index shot slightly past the 40-mark, noting a slight increase in demand. The buying strength, however, continues to be neutral. The price of the altcoin was below the 20-Simple Moving Average. This reading indicated that the selling pressure continues to dominate as sellers drive the market’s price momentum. ADA has also witnessed mixed signals on the one-day chart. Per the buying strength, the Awesome Oscillator also started to depict positive price action. The green signal bars on AO were the buy signal for the coin. On the other hand, the Parabolic SAR signaled that downward price movement. The dotted lines were above the price candlestick, indicating that the bears continue to drive the price action in the market. ADA must cross the $0.32 threshold for bullish forces to take over.

42394102,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvXX4N,1669563900,"Some Things to Be Thankful For, Even Though Everything in Crypto Is On Fire","Crypto in November has basically been a mess because of the fall of FTX.  Enough doomscrolling. We’re entering the Thanksgiving (in the U.S.) and year-end holiday season. So here are some crypto-related things that I am, and you should be, thankful for.  There is much to be thankful for.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Sunday.  I am thankful that Bitcoin still works  Leave it to a bitcoin maximalist to make this about Bitcoin somehow. But it’s true. I am thankful that through all this turmoil, Bitcoin is ticking along. Blocks are still being mined and the network has nary a hiccup.  And not only is Bitcoin working, but bitcoiners are working. We’ve seen both meaningful discussions around self-custody (plus exchange outflows have broken historical records) and developers are developing new useful tools (plus an announcement of an announcement of an old idea).  What’s more, bitcoin is trading around $16,000. With public bitcoin miners struggling, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) trading at a record discount to net asset value, Genesis Global Capital hiring a financial adviser after disclosing losses and suspending redemptions, and most bitcoin holders holding their bitcoins at a loss, bitcoin remaining steady around a $16,000 price level is nothing short of remarkable.  (Grayscale and Genesis Global Capital are both owned by Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.)  Tick tock, next block.  Why you should be thankful: When times are tough, people show you who they are; so do crypto protocols. Times are tough and investors and enthusiasts alike should take solace in the fact that Bitcoin is a sewer rat and will come out of this stronger.  I am thankful the fallout isn’t really DeFi’s fault.  Of course, as a bitcoin maximalist, my main criticism of crypto’s decentralized finance (DeFi) sub-industry is that it is mainly used as a circular, closed-loop model for gambling. Things like yield farming, play-to-earn, liquidity pools and the like might have some utility, but it does seem that most are just different flavors of speculation on coins.  Still, the financial pain that has been wrought this month wasn’t DeFi’s fault. The failure of FTX was a failure of trusted third parties and people.  Why you should be thankful: Even if speculation is the use case for DeFi and crypto, there is something to be said that the protocols didn’t break when FTX went down. If you think companies and institutions should crop up around crypto, this is simply a lesson in building better companies and institutions rather than a declaration that there’s nothing to be built around this technology, movement or whatever.  I am thankful the fallout happened during a bear market.  Genuinely.  Last week I wrote about FTX-related contagion: “Crypto is simply not big enough to have a serious impact on the broader economy.” I wrote something similar in May right after the Terra crash led to $40 billion in losses: “Except next time an undercollateralized, algorithmic stablecoin fails, it’s not going to be $40 billion of lost value. It might be $400 billion. That could be catastrophic.”  The crypto market is small now, so the tendrils of its reach are also small. This “contagion” should blow over without touching the non-crypto economy.  Why you should be thankful: Whatever dies in crypto because of FTX’s downfall dies without too many far-reaching effects.  I am thankful exchanges are considering proof of reserves.  Following the FTX bankruptcy filing, industry professionals were calling for exchanges to implement proof of reserves. Proof of reserves should provide an assurance to customers that exchanges are in fact holding their funds. (I wrote about it here.) A less-talked-about aspect of proof of reserves that should be more talked about is the idea that we might run into an issue regarding the total amount of circulating bitcoin crypto exchanges say they have.  Why you should be thankful: The ability to hold your own coins is part of the value proposition of most cryptocurrencies. From the perspective of the Bitcoin system, one of the value propositions is that there is a finite, provably scarce number of bitcoin. If exchanges were found to be circulating an amount in excess of the number of bitcoin issued (i.e., they are selling paper, fake bitcoins rather than real bitcoins) we could: a) out some bad-faith actors in the space and b) see some crazy price movement as the demand for “real, actual” bitcoin spikes dramatically.  I am thankful we have editorial independence at CoinDesk.  Lastly, a shameless plug and unprompted advertisement for my employer and colleagues. CoinDesk’s Ian Allison is the reporter who tipped the first domino that led to the FTX bankruptcy filing. All along the way we’ve been reporting fast and, often, first. Our reporting has led to market moves and ultimately to uncertainty for some of our sister companies (Grayscale, Genesis) and by extension our parent company DCG.  While skeptics still eye our attachment to our sister companies with a healthy cynicism (as they should: “Don’t Trust, Verify”), we’ve at least proven that we aren’t afraid to report when reporting is needed.

4841152,https://newsbtc.com/?p=510188,1669558854,"Uniswap Price Struggles At $5.49, Will There Be A Run Up To $6?","After sustaining bullish price action for the past two days, the Uniswap price has registered a shift in its price movement. With a 0.9% loss in the last 24 hours, price sentiment has shifted toward the bears. At press time, Uniswap has struggled to move past its rigid resistance mark of $4.50. There is a chance that investors could book profits if UNI moves past the aforementioned price level. The coin has, however, struggled at its immediate resistance of $5.49. Uniswap has to flip the critical resistance into the support zone to move up to its next price ceiling of $6. If Uniswap price does not sustain above $5.49, then the altcoin could lose the support floor at $4.99. That would invalidate the bullish momentum, bringing the coin down to the next level. Related Reading: Chainlink Extends Accumulation By 200 Days; Will Bulls Push For A Breakout? Uniswap Price Analysis: One-Day Chart UNI was trading at $5.46 at the time of writing. The coin had almost breached the $5.49 price level, but the coin met with a sell-off. If the cryptocurrency fails to trade above $5.49, it will lose momentum. Buyers have to take precedence if the bearish momentum has to be negated. Overhead resistance stood at $5.70, and moving above that would help the altcoin climb to $6. In the event of a downward trend, UNI will remain at $4.70 for some time before moving further. The amount of UNI traded in the last session increased, signifying an increase in demand. Technical Analysis Buyers have increased over the past trading sessions, although the indicators remain below the neutral zone. This is an indicator that the market has yet to register substantial demand. The Relative Strength Index was above the 40 mark, signifying that sellers were still active. If the buyers take charge in the next trading session, UNI will turn bullish again. Regarding buying strength, UNI was below the 20-Simple Moving Average line, which meant that sellers were driving the price momentum in the market. The De-Fi token has to flip $5.70 to a support line, so the bulls register a considerable upswing price. UNI has not yet broken free from the grip of the bears, as the coin indicated the presence of a sell signal on the one-day chart. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence displays price momentum and changes in trends. MACD was still forming red signal bars, which correspond with a sell signal. The Directional Movement Index (DMI) was negative as the -DI (orange) line was above the +DI (blue) line, which pictured a bearish trend. The average Directional Index (red) ran above the 20-mark to signify strength in the bearish thesis. Should the bearish thesis be invalidated, a jump above $5.49 remains crucial.

In the last 24 hours, BTC has been moving sideways after claiming the $16,000 price mark. Since the coin is trading sideways at the moment after the recovery, Bitcoin awaits a breakout. The coin will have to move above the $16,600 mark in order for the bears to be invalidated. Now that Bitcoin is closer to the aforementioned price resistance mark, there could be a chance for BTC to move to the $17,000 price zone. Buyers need to step up in order for the coin to move above the $16,600 price mark. The coin’s technical outlook confirms that it is trending upward on its chart. The buying strength has, however, remained low despite an uptick on the one-day chart. Related Reading: Dogecoin Rallies As Price Breaks Major Resistance; Here Is Why $0.15 Is Possible Bitcoin Price Analysis: One-Day Chart BTC was trading at $16,500 at the time of writing. After Bitcoin broke past the $15,400 price level, the coin registered positive buying action. This has contributed to the coin’s price rising above the $16,000 mark. The crucial price zone remains at $16,500, and a move above it will be a point of bullish momentum for Bitcoin. BTC’s overhead resistance was at $17,000, and a move above that could halt bulls at $17,600. BTC will reach a psychological level of $18,000 if it rises above $17,600. The amount of BTC traded in the previous session was green, indicating accumulation. Technical Analysis The coin had recently visited the oversold zone in the middle of this month, and the move above the $15,400 mark had caused buyers to regain confidence in the asset. At the time of writing, BTC registered demand on the one-day chart. The Relative Strength Index was moving above the 40-mark as demand for the coin returned to the market. If demand remains consistent, a move above $17,000 would happen over the next trading session. Bitcoin can jump above the 20-Simple Moving Average if the coin crosses the $16,700 price mark. At the moment, BTC was below the 20-SMA. This indicated that sellers were still driving the price momentum in the market. In correspondence to the buying strength, BTC also depicted the start of the buy signal for the coin. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicates price momentum and trend change. MACD displayed green signal bars, which are tied to the buy signal for BTC. In anticipation of rangebound movement, the Bollinger Bands, which indicate price fluctuation, narrowed. A rise in demand will help bulls gain strength and break past the current trading range. Related Reading: Chainlink Extends Accumulation By 200 Days; Will Bulls Push For A Breakout?
