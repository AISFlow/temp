42404601,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdj4gL,1588633170,Telegram Withdraws Offer to Repay Investors With Gram Tokens,"Telegram won’t be repaying its investors in gram tokens after all.      The messaging platform told investors in its TON blockchain project Monday it would not be paying investors back in tokens, and it was looking to buy American investors out immediately.      Telegram, which has twice delayed the launch of its new network, is contractually obligated to pay investors back 72% of their investments immediately after missing an April 30 launch deadline, but has offered to pay investors 110% of their investment if they wait a year for the network to go live as it grapples with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over whether its token sale violated federal securities law.      The company currently hopes to launch in April 2021, pending the outcome of this case.      Just last week, Telegram left the door open to investors being repaid in grams, writing that if investors agreed to wait that year and leave their money with Telegram as a loan, they could get repaid in TON’s native tokens, dubbed grams “or another cryptocurrency,” according to the previous communication by Telegram. However, the crypto option has now been deemed infeasible.      “Unfortunately, based on more recent discussions with relevant authorities and our counsel, we have made the difficult decision not to pursue an option involving grams or another cryptocurrency due to its uncertain reception from the relevant regulators,” said the letter, which was shared with CoinDesk.      The loan option is still there, the letter continues, but the payment will not be in crypto.    Americans out    Telegram is only making the offer to its non-U.S. customers. American customers will be required to accept the 72% payouts, the letter said.      “This offer is only being made available to offerees outside the United States who are not U.S. persons within the meaning of Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933,” Telegram wrote.      The investors are asked to reply by 5:00 p.m. London time on Tuesday, May 5, 2020, to indicate whether they are located outside the United States.      “We intend to ask you to return signed documents in relation to this new transaction by Monday, May 11, 2020, so we need your initial response to this email as soon as possible,” the letter ends.      According to Russian news publication The Bell, U.S. investors received a different version of the letter, explicitly saying they can only take back 72% of their investment.      Telegram did not address its intention to possibly sell equity to raise the funds it needs to repay investors in Monday’s letter. Spokesperson Remi Vaughn previously told CoinDesk investors in the TON project itself won’t receive equity as repayment, but that the company might raise cash through equity sales.      Telegram, which raised $1.7 billion in 2018 for its TON blockchain, has already delayed TON’s launch once due to regulatory concerns. The network was originally set to go live on Oct. 30, 2019, but was delayed to April 30, 2020, after the SEC sued Telegram on allegations of violating securities law last year. The latest delay comes after a judge upheld a preliminary injunction prohibiting the issuance of gram tokens.",NEGATIVE,TON,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TON | TOKEN SALE,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/05/04/telegram-withdraws-offer-to-repay-investors-with-gram-tokens,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d05f4036333f8e9a44c3a278f4d28b231a080a44-1200x795.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In their final report to the FDA, the project’s sponsor, the partners called distributed ledger technology (DLT) a safety-enhancing answer to the U.S. Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA), which gives the pharmaceutical industry until 2024 to implement stringent new electronic tracing requirements on drug packaging.      “With the use of a blockchain-enabled solution, this technology might be able to address the foundational requirement of track and trace for DSCSA in addition to establishing trust between trading partners,” the report said.      The trial began in June 2019 and the project was built on Hyperledger Fabric. At the time, a Walmart spokesperson said the company was hoping to build a more transparent supply chain for its customers.      The companies completed the trial last December.      ""The pharma supply chain is really incredibly complex, given the number of entities and logistics providers and distributors,"" said Tegan Keele, KPMG's blockchain lead. All these players use different systems – oftentimes, these systems fail to meet DSCSA's interoperability requirements. The consortium's hypothesis was that blockchain could be their information bridge, she said.      Nearly a year after testing began, the consortium found its hypothesis correct. The partners said a permissioned blockchain network could bring that highly fragmented supply chain into DSCSA compliance. The system could track drug movements while also limiting the flow of private information and, most critically, work across partners that don’t otherwise interact.      See also: Is Blockchain the Shot in the Arm Healthcare Needs?      Blockchain could also boost product safety by speeding the execution of crucial supply chain safeguards such as recalls, the group said. They estimated their blockchain could alert downstream partners of recalls in 10 seconds, an “exponentially expedited” improvement over the current pace of up to three days.      “To foster industry adoption, an egalitarian, inclusive, open-sourced commercial solution should be considered to help launch a blockchain network intended for information exchange of the pharmaceutical product transactions in the United States,” the group wrote in its report.

Bitcoin (BTC) was trading down less than 1 percent over 24 hours , with 10-day and 50-day technical indicator moving averages signaling bearish sentiment Monday. In early trading at 00:00 UTC, the world’s first cryptocurrency’s price tumbled from $8,950 to $8,533 but rebounded to at $8,837 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. EDT).      As April turned to May, spot exchange Coinbase experienced larger-than-normal volume - numbers not seen since March 13, when the exchange had $673 million in total one-day trading for BTC/USD.      On Wednesday April 29, the San Francisco-based platform experienced a technical outage and had a $410 million volume. Thursday, April 30, the price for bitcoin on Coinbase rose to as high as $9,400 on $399 million in volume. Friday, May 1, saw Coinbase volumes down to $191 million into the weekend.      Volume on Coinbase for Monday is at $136 million as of press time. Rupert Douglas, head of business development, institutional sales at Koine, says there are fewer people hitting the Buy button to start the week. “We’re now overextended. I thought we would get to $9,550, but we fell short and it looks like a lack of buyers at these levels,” Douglas said.      Gabriel Kurman, a long-time bitcoin advocate and co-founder of Argentina-based blockchain software provider IOV Labs, is still incredibly bullish. Kurman is like a lot of traders, expecting the price of bitcoin to go up ahead of the expected May 12 halving. At that time, rewards for successfully mining a block in Bitcoin’s blockchain will be reduced to 6.25 BTC from 12.5 BTC.      “Even before factoring in the reduction of the bitcoin supply resulting from the halving, BTC should increase its dollar-denominated value by 30%, given its mathematical scarcity and immutability,” he said.      Read more: Capitalism’s Biggest Crisis Isn’t Driving People to Bitcoin – It’s the Volatility      Mining power has been rising steadily as the halving approaches. The halving could result in less selling pressure in the market as some miners will likely turn off some machines post-halving, said Chris Bendiksen, head of research at digital asset manager CoinShares.      “The pairing of a 50% reduction in available new supply with a reduction in the proportion of ongoing supply offered for sale in the market might drastically reduce the persistent selling pressure caused by miners,” Bendiksen noted.      Traders will be keeping an eye on mining power after the halving to gauge selling pressure on bitcoin when miner rewards are reduced.    Other markets    Most digital assets on CoinDesk’s big board performed poorly Monday. The second-largest asset by market capitalization, ether (ETH), lost 2.7% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. EDT).      Cryptocurrency losers include monero (XMR) slipping 4%, nem (XEM) in the red 3% and zcash (ZEC) losing 3%.

More precisely, the polymath platform allows users to issue tradable tokens that are specifically designed to comply with securities laws to ""know-your-customer"" (KYC) compliant investors via smart contracts.  Security tokens are specifically intended to represent a complete or fractional ownership in an asset (i.e company, real estate, intellectual property). These tokenized, tradable representations of stakes are released through smart contracts and available to strictly KYC compliant investors.  The polymath network raised nearly $59 million through an initial coin offering (ICO) in January 2018, the same month the platform went live. It has a native token, POLY, which is spent and earned through the process of smart contract creation, issuance, and legal validation. POLY tokens are ERC-20 utility tokens, but security tokens that are issued on the polymath network must be ""ST-20,"" a created standard that allows token issuers to maintain regulatory compliance through specified transfer restrictions.  In 2019, Polymath announced it planned to launch a new platform specifically for security tokens, polymesh, which will run on its own blockchain rather than on Ethereum. Polymesh will be built in collaboration with Charles Hoskinson, a co-founder of both Ethereum and Cardano. Hoskinson has argued that because financial markets, their participants and securities have a specific set of requirements, security token protocols and public ledgers can be optimized by having their own blockchain.  Polymath claims the polymesh platform will not interfere with its current polymath network. Additionally, the company says the polymesh platform will not restrict any specific type of assets and will likely retain the POLY token without the launch of an alternative token.",NEUTRAL,없음,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | TOKEN SALE,Matthew Kimmell,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/polymath,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4de4b67ebd076322345bb00b7477f7fb193aab93-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404616,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdj4t8,1588614093,Stablecoins Push Ethereum's Transaction Count to Highest Since July 2019,"Ethereum’s network is experiencing its busiest days in 10 months amid increased issuance of stablecoins and the runup to Ethereum 2.0.      The seven-day moving average of the total number of confirmed transactions on Ethereum’s blockchain rose to 845,400 on April 30 to hit the highest level since July 1 , 2019, according to the data source Coin Metrics. As of Sunday, the average was 837,100.      The transaction count had declined to 12-month lows in February. Since then, however, it has surged by 72%.    “The recent Cambrian explosionhttps://burgess-shale.rom.on.ca/en/science/origin/04-cambrian-explosion.php of stablecoin issuance has been a considerable driver of on-chain activity,” said Lucas Nuzzi, network data product manager at Coin Metrics, a provider of crypto financial data.    Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that offer price stability characteristics by pegging their value to some external reference, usually the U.S. dollar.      Read more: The Stablecoin Surge Is Built on Smoke and Mirrors      Tether (USDT), trueUSD (TUSD), gemini dollar (GUSD), paxos standard (PAX), binance USD (BUSD), USD coin (USDC), Huobi’s HUSD, and MakerDAO’s DAI are some of the best-known stablecoins. These major stablecoins are based on Ethereum’s blockchain.       The market capitalization of major stablecoins has risen from $3.5 billion to over $7 billion over the last two months, according to Coin Metrics.      Also, as of April 21, the market capitalization of all stablecoins operating on Ethereum's blockchain was over $9 billion, according to crypto investor and founder of Mythos Capital Ryan Sean Adam.      The uptick in the demand for and the issuance of stablecoins has coincided with the coronavirus-induced dollar shortage influencing the global economy.      Since the start of the pandemic, indicators of dollar funding costs in foreign exchange markets have risen sharply. For instance, three-month euro-dollar swaps, a widely followed indicator of dollar-funding costs in the foreign exchange markets, rose to a nine-year high of 150 basis points in March.      Read more: Ethereum Now Matches Bitcoin on One Key Metric      While the dollar-funding stress has eased somewhat over the past few weeks due to the U.S. Federal Reserve’s massive liquidity injections, the crisis looks far from over for emerging markets, which lost around $1.5 billion in forex exchange reserves per day in March, according to Bloomberg.      Some observers think the crisis has boosted stablecoins’ appeal as less-volatile instruments of transferring value on-chain.      ""The economic impacts of COVID-19 have created USD shortages around the world, especially in emerging markets,” said Nuzzi. “As such, USD stablecoins could be providing an alternative to physical dollars in jurisdictions experiencing stricter capital controls and currency devaluation.""      Yet, the increase in transactions may not be entirely due to stablecoin growth. Connor Abendeschien, crypto research analyst at Digital Assets Data, cited Ethereum’s impending transition from the proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism, dubbed Ethereum 2.0, as one of the possible reasons for the rise in Ethereum’s on-chain transactions.      In PoW, miners solve cryptographically hard puzzles to complete transactions on the network and get rewarded. In PoS, instead of miners there are validators, which lock up some of their ether as a stake in the ecosystem. A block validator is then selected based on its economic stake in the network via a pseudo-random election process.      Read more: What the CFTC Chairman Actually Said About Ether Futures and Ethereum 2.0      Backing Abendeschien’s argument is the recent sharp rise in the number of addresses holding more than or equal to 32 ETH, an amount a holder is required to maintain as a balance to become a validator on 2.0.      The number of validator addresses rose sharply in the days leading up to the launch of the testnet version of Ethereum’s 2.0 upgrade on April 18 and hit a record high of 11,6750 on April 28. That boosted the transaction count, according to data provided by the blockchain intelligence firm Glassnode.    Broad range intact    While there has been a recent uptick in the transaction count, the metric is still within the broad range of 900,000 to 400,000 seen since February 2018.      Gavin Smith, CEO of cryptocurrency consortium Panxora, expects the transaction count to grow organically in the future. “One important factor to take into account is that Ethereum is still by far the favored smart contract vehicle in the crypto space and the upcoming transition to PoS will help the network cope with the ever-growing demand,” said Smith.      Read more: 5 Takeaways on Ethereum 2.0 From Vitalik's 'Beast Mode' Blog Posts      Also, a rally in ether’s price could boost transaction count. “On-chain activity tends to follow price,” said Wilson Withiam, research analyst at Messari, a provider of crypto data, tools, and research.      The recent growth in Ethereum’s transaction count is accompanied by a stellar rise in price. At press time, the second-largest cryptocurrency is trading around $205 on major exchanges, representing a 127% gain on the low of $90 observed on March 13.",POSITIVE,ETH | TUSD,ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | TUSD,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/04/stablecoins-push-ethereums-transaction-count-to-highest-since-july-2019,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/90ce42828154205515115359ea92859da400d176-2840x1832.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk's newsletters here.      Still, as with any emerging technology, there are visible fault lines. Researchers at Kaspersky and EY have said enterprise blockchains may be walled-off but they are easily penetrated. Here's the story:    Top Shelf    Deposing Banks The Bitfinex crypto exchange is making a new push to find and potentially recover more than $800 million in user funds seized by legal authorities in four different countries after its payment processor’s bank accounts were frozen. iFinex Inc., Bitfinex's parent firm, applied for subpoenas in Colorado, Arizona and Georgia this month, asking federal courts to aid it in deposing banks that may have held funds for Crypto Capital, the payment processor on which Bitfinex stored customers’ and exchange funds.      Emerging Market Citizens in the Middle East are turning to crypto – from bitcoin to stablecoins – to resist the effects of weak governments and wildly fluctuating exchange rates. CoinDesk’s Leigh Cuen weighs in on the phenomenon as part of a three-part column on how cryptocurrencies are used in the developing world, leading up to her “Crypto Across Emerging Markets” panel at Consensus: Distributed.      Enterprise Risks Enterprise-grade private blockchains, the supposedly more efficient sister to public chains, are vulnerable to denial of service attacks and insider threats, according to researchers at Kaspersky and EY. “Open source code that isn’t widely used and doesn’t have a vigilant community testing and inspecting it is far less secure and reliable than systems like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are continuously hardened by nearly constant attack and public inspection,” said Paul Brody, EY's global blockchain lead.      Blockchain Voting The Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, a U.S. Senate subcommittee unit, floated blockchain voting as a way to keep the chamber legislating through crises. “The Senate may consider blockchain” if its 100 members must vote remotely, staffers wrote. It also proposed voting on end-to-end encryption platforms and via a military-esque “air-gapped” communications system akin to those presidents and generals use.      Fraud Ruling A New Jersey judge dismissed a lawsuit against Riot Blockchain, which alleged the firm committed securities fraud by changing its name to ""Riot Blockchain"" in an effort to boost its share price.      Restricted Access Japan has amended the way cryptocurrencies are regulated within the country, prompting BitMEX to begin restricting access to local residents, the exchange announced last week.      New Collateral? MakerDAO may collaterialize tBTC, an Ethereum-based token pegged to bitcoin. Though the token is expected to launch in mid-May, Matt Luongo, tBTC’s creator, proposed the move Sunday on MakerDAO’s forum. ""While I believe BTC can be great collateral for DAI, more importantly, I believe a native BTC on-ramp into the ecosystem can grow the protocol’s user base,” he said. (The Block)      Bitcoin's Benefits Even as stocks tread water, it's likely the global economy is due for a correction. Bitcoin's underlying technology and monetary system make it one of the few investable assets that is immune to the economic fluctuations we have ahead, argues CoinDesk Director of Research Noelle Acheson, in the latest Crypto Long & Short newsletter.      Granted More than 150 Ethereum projects have received nearly $25 million in total grant money to date, primarily from the Ethereum Foundation. (The Block)      Porsche-Backed Gapless, a blockchain startup meant to track vehicle ownership, raised about $6 million from FinLab EOS VC Fund and previous investor Porsche among others.

Zoom participants can ask questions directly to our guests.    Market Intel    Price Pullback? While bitcoin is rallying ahead of the halving, jumping from $6,700 to $9,400 in the last 10 days of April alone, historical data suggests it could suffer a temporary price pullback following the supply-altering event. On-chain data suggests both small and large investors are accumulating coins in the run-up to the event. As a result, a bout of profit taking may be seen after May 12. Some investors, especially short-term traders, may sell their coins after halving, putting downside pressure on prices.      Public Interest Bitcoin is up 21% in 2020 to about $8,600, during a time when the pandemic laid bare some of the structural vulnerabilities of the post-Bretton Woods monetary system. While bitcoin is outperforming the S&P 500 as well as gold, it still appears popular interest in the cryptocurrency is still tied to its ongoing price volatility.    CoinDesk Podcast Network    Miner Interests F2Pool is the largest bitcoin mining pool in the world, controlling 20% of the collective computational energy on the Bitcoin network. On the fifth and final episode of Bitcoin Halving 2020: Miner Perspectives, Thomas Heller, the mining pool's global business director, discusses the economic incentives driving cryptocurrency mining and mining pool operations.

It also revealed the stealth-mode launch of the NEAR mainnet on April 22.      The terms of the deal were defined by a16z and joined by some 40 other investment firms including Pantera Capital, Libertus, Blockchange, Animal Ventures, Distributed Global and Notation Capital, according to NEAR co-founder Illia Polosukhin. The token sale is the network’s second following a $12.1 million round last July.      NEAR Foundation CEO Erik Trautman said the protocol – a sharded, Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain – operates in a similar design space as the forthcoming Ethereum 2.0 and the existing Cosmos network.      Read more: Dapp Platform Near Raises $12.1 Million From Metastable, Accomplice      A databasing method, sharding breaks blockchain storage for PoS chains onto multiple “shards” or servers separated from one another. The main benefit of sharding lies in how blockchains communicate with one another: If every node has to settle every transaction, the blockchain will be slow; if transactions are broken into groupings of shards, transactions can be processed more quickly.      That doesn’t mean scalability is NEAR’s first focus, said Aliaksandr Hudzilin, NEAR’s head of business development. “It’s so early. Nobody needs scalability,” Hudzilin said.      He said the team’s initial focus is creating a developer community around its blockchain through programs with projects such as Flux Markets, Stardust and TessaB.      Read more: Ready Layer One: Base Layer Protocols Team for Virtual Developer Event      In that vein, NEAR says it’s moving forward slowly and deliberately given the implications of code flaws in a blockchain intended for financial applications. The network will operate under a Proof-of-Authority (PoA) consensus algorithm administered by the NEAR Foundation and the 40 or so validators who purchased tokens from the foundation.      The foundation will oversee token address creation and transactions until Phase 2 kicks in with fewer restrictions later this summer, according to a NEAR blog post. Phase 2 and Phase 3 will transition the blockchain to a PoS system and community governance following general testing.      “It’s actually kind of the only way to do it,” Trautman said. “Our goal is to hand off as quickly as possible from this PoA run to [the] Foundation not touching it.”",POSITIVE,NEAR,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | NEAR | TOKEN SALE,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/05/04/near-protocol-launches-following-21m-token-sale-led-by-andreessen-horowitz,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/72633deebcc3c72301f6ec99f36db2ca298b1395-1024x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A new partnership with StakeWith.US, a Singapore-based blockchain infrastructure firm that provides staking services, is expected to provide ""greater flexibility"" for stakeholders and community members by increasing their control over decision-making, Kyber said.      Holders of Kyber Network Crystal (KNC), an Ethereum-based (ERC-20) token, will be able to delegate their tokens and voting power to StakeWith.US's staking pool, ATLAS, when the network's Katalyst upgrade is completed by the end of June.      ""This seems like a logical tie-up and would allow KNC token holders who are either too busy or don't feel comfortable enough to vote on KyberDAO initiatives to delegate their votes to an informed third party and still receive voting rewards,"" said Gerrit van Wingerden, CTO and co-founder of crypto asset management platform Caspian.      Kyber Network is a decentralized exchange that allows instant trading and conversion of cryptocurrencies and tokens with high liquidity.      Under the planned protocol upgrade, KNC holders will be able to vote on various protocol decisions and in return will receive rewards from network fees in the form of ether (ETH).      See also: New Cross-Chain Network Plans to Bring Bitcoin’s Liquidity to the DeFi Space      “Kyber will be the only protocol that has a deflationary staking token with network fees paid out in ETH, an asset with monetary premium,” said Michael Ng, co-founder of StakeWith.Us.      With the change, KNC holders will receive their ETH rewards based on the number of tokens staked. Token burn and rewards are determined by actual network usage and DeFi growth, Kyber said.      ""It's interesting to see staking providers, such as StakeWithUs, working closer with DAOs. Collaboration will lead a healthy debate around governance and proxy smart contracts,"" said David Freuden, DAO enthusiast and founder of Monsterplay, a blockchain consultancy firm working in the areas of smart cities, privacy and decentralized autonomous organisations.

42383598,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9xW2x,1588593600,The Stablecoin Surge Is Built on Smoke and Mirrors,"Frances Coppola, a CoinDesk columnist, is a freelance writer and speaker on banking, finance and economics. Her book “The Case for People’s Quantitative Easing” explains how modern money creation and quantitative easing work, and advocates “helicopter money” to help economies out of recession.      There’s a desperate shortage of dollars. Despite the Federal Reserve creating new money at an unprecedented rate, the U.S. dollar exchange rate is rising. The U.S. government is pouring trillions of dollars into the economy to support failing businesses and people losing their jobs. When governments and central banks put new money into the economy, consumer prices usually rise. But in March, against what you would expect, consumer prices fell by 0.4%.      As dollars are apparently being swallowed up by the black hole created by the coronavirus, issuance of dollar-backed stablecoins is soaring as more and more people invest in them. Especially popular are stablecoins such as USDT, USDC, BUSD and Pax, which are backed one-for-one with dollar reserves.      See also: Money Reimagined: Demand for USD Stablecoins Foreshadows Financial Disruption      What’s driving this growing interest in stablecoins? One explanation might be investors reaching for yield. As global interest rates fall, returns on conventional assets become increasingly disappointing. Stablecoins themselves don’t deliver dollar returns – indeed they are designed not to – but they do give easy access to the crypto world for investors looking for better returns.      This is a persuasive argument. Right now, the outlook is bullish for crypto. Partly, this is because of bitcoin’s forthcoming halving: after previous halvings the price has always risen sharply, so there could be a potential profit opportunity from getting in now. But it’s also because of a growing belief among investors that the Fed’s extraordinary rate of money creation could result in runaway inflation. A century ago, central bank money printing in Germany’s Weimar Republic caused prices to rise so much that people paid for loaves of bread with wheelbarrows full of banknotes. Get your wheelbarrows out, dollar slaves!      Runaway inflation in fiat currencies would be good for Bitcoin, and indeed for any scarce asset. After all, who is going to want to keep their savings in the form of dollars if the dollars are going to be inflated away any time now? So wise investors might exchange their dollars for crypto, thus benefiting from what could be a considerable bull run as fiat currencies burn. Though the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation expectations, the five-year, five-year forward spread, is not predicting runaway inflation. If anything, it is deflation, not inflation, that most investors foresee.      CoinDesk's Michael Casey wonders if the surge in stablecoins could be driven not by investors reaching for yield or expecting high inflation, but by businesses desperate to find a secure source of dollar liquidity at a time of crisis. Stablecoins, after all, are equivalent to dollars. And they provide access to a payments network that is global, usually efficient, and – importantly – doesn’t rely on banks.    Whether stablecoin issuers can meet the FDIC’s requirements has not yet been tested.    Banks depend for their survival on the solvency of their borrowers. When the economy crashes, businesses fail and people lose their jobs, banks can become very wobbly. And, since the 2008 crisis, government bailouts of banks have become anathema. These days, deposits can be “haircut” to bail out banks, as they were in Cyprus. Or banks can close their doors, and governments can stop you taking out your money via ATMs, as happened in Greece. So your deposits can shrink or you can lose access to them just when you most need money to keep your business afloat.      Because of the scale of business failures and job losses at the moment, widespread loan defaults – and associated bank failures – seem highly likely. “Given the post-COVID-19 outlook for banks’ loan customers,” says Casey, “some will doubt the security of their deposits, regardless of whether they are denominated in dollars.”      And he continues:    What’s a business to do then? They can’t withdraw and hoard cash to protect themselves; banknotes are hardly a viable payments option in the modern world. But perhaps dollar-backed stablecoins pose an option….    Banks don’t keep enough cash reserves to ensure everyone can withdraw their money whenever they want to. But stablecoins do. So, why not put your money into fully reserved stablecoins instead of fractionally reserved banks? Your dollars would be completely safe, and you would also have the opportunity to invest in cryptocurrencies or lend out your stablecoins for a good return.      As Casey puts it, “Since the token issuer commits to hold the full equivalent in reserves for all tokens issued, the fractional reserve system’s perennial question about deposit assurance ceases to be an issue.”      Sadly, this is much too good to be true. The reserve backing of these stablecoins is smoke and mirrors, just like the reserve backing of banks. Indeed it relies on exactly the same confidence trick.      See also: Marek Olszewski - Why This Global Crisis Is a Defining Moment for Stablecoins      Reserves for the four biggest stablecoins – USDT, USDC, Pax and BUSD – are all kept in banks, mostly in deposit accounts, though some are in money market accounts backed by U.S. Treasurys. The banks have FDIC insurance, of course, but then so do ordinary bank deposit accounts. If businesses’ own FDIC-insured bank deposit accounts aren’t safe, then neither are the FDIC-insured deposit accounts that hold stablecoin reserves.      What’s more, FDIC insurance is limited. The standard limit is $250,000 per customer, depository institution, and ownership category. So, a business with several accounts in one bank whose balances together add up to $300,000 is only covered by insurance for the first $250,000. But if the business has accounts at two different banks with less than $250,000 in each bank, then they are fully insured.      For the four stablecoins I looked at, the quantity of pooled reserves in the deposit accounts appears to exceed FDIC insurance limits. Indeed in the case of Paxos, which manages the reserves of not only its own stablecoin Pax, but also Binance’s BUSD, the auditor’s report specifically says that the amounts in the deposit accounts exceed FDIC limits. So although the reserves exist, they are not fully insured. If the banks in which they are held fail, stablecoin reserves in excess of FDIC limits could be seized to bail out the banks.    The reserve status of stablecoins may be a confidence trick, but the investment opportunity is real.    Some stablecoin issuers claim that stablecoin “deposits” (the dollars you pay when you buy stablecoins) qualify for FDIC pass-through insurance. The argument is that the dollars are held in custody in common accounts on your behalf. But FDIC pass-through insurance comes with significant restrictions: for example, people’s individual deposits within the common funds must be clearly identifiable and regularly reported. It also excludes investments such as mutual funds and securities. Whether stablecoin issuers can meet the FDIC’s requirements has not yet been tested. And nor has the legal status of stablecoins that are issued by, and actively traded on, crypto exchanges solely for the purpose of speculation in cryptocurrencies. Speculative assets aren’t covered by FDIC insurance.      So, stablecoin reserves may not be fully protected by FDIC insurance. And if they aren’t, then stablecoins may actually be less secure than ordinary bank deposit accounts. If people really are investing in stablecoins because they think they are safer than bank deposit accounts, I’m afraid they have allowed the smoke to get in their eyes and the mirrors to blind them.      That doesn’t mean that investing in stablecoins is a bad idea. After all, there is that halving coming up, and there is the possibility of inflation. And returns on crypto assets can be really good.

42383606,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9xW9F,1588591812,First Mover: Capitalism’s Biggest Crisis Isn’t Driving People to Bitcoin – It’s the Volatility,"“It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.”      The opening line to Charles Dickens’ ""A Tale of Two Cities"" provides an apt enough description of the moment crypto investors now find themselves in as the coronavirus takes a devastating toll on the global economy, raising ugly questions about the sustainability of the traditional financial system.      You're reading First Mover, CoinDesk's daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      Bitcoin is up 21% in 2020 to about $8,600. Such a performance contrasts with a 12% loss this year in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index of U.S. stocks. It also exceeds trusted gold's 12% gain.      At the same time, the pandemic has, with brutal efficiency, laid bare some of the structural vulnerabilities of the post-Bretton Woods monetary system, with the U.S. dollar as the de facto global reserve currency.      One of crypto bulls' longest-running narratives is traditional finance is structurally unstable, and when the system comes under pressure, investors will turn to digital assets.      The Federal Reserve's recent move to inject trillions of dollars of new money into the financial system, including for purchases of junk bonds, would seem to comport with the spirit the newspaper headline embedded into the Bitcoin blockchain's genesis block in early 2009, in the wake of the last crisis: “Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.”      Many crypto-industry executives have stuck to the message that the traditional system is decaying. In its year-end 2020 results, London-listed mining firm Argo Blockchain said it expected looser monetary policy to hurt confidence in fiat currencies, a dynamic that could ultimately drive crypto adoption as people hunt for alternative stores of value.  But is that message resonating? Not necessarily among the broader population, based on the number of twitter users mentioning “bitcoin” in tweets, according to an analysis by The TIE, a data provider:      Instead it appears that popular interest in bitcoin might be more tied to its notable price volatility.      The number of Twitter users mentioning bitcoin soared after March 12's now-infamous 39% sell-off, but the frequency ebbed as volatility subsided in April.      The Fed was buying junk bonds. Europe was desperately hashing together a stimulus package. But conversations about bitcoin grew quieter as volatility dropped to a three-month low, even as prices for the cryptocurrency were rebounding.      Twitter sentiment on bitcoin – defined as how positive or negative a tweet about the cryptocurrency was – has risen along with the price.      But even as average sentiment last week hit its highest level since July 2018, the number of people discussing bitcoin on Twitter dropped to just 12,000, according to Joshua Frank, CEO of The TIE.      Those tweeting, Frank said, appeared overwhelmingly focused on bitcoin's upcoming ""halving,"" where mining rewards get cut in half every four years. Tweets mentioning ""halving"" were three times higher than the number that mentioned ""gold,"" which is seen by many traditional investors as an accepted hedge against inflation and broader financial turmoil, he said.      Another view comes from looking at cryptocurrency's rising trading volumes. CryptoCompare’s data shows year-to-date spot volumes in 2020 have, almost always, exceeded those of previous years.      Using the 2016 halving event as an anchor, it's clear volumes in the weeks leading up to the halving peaked at $1.6 billion. In contrast, this year's busiest day, just after the March 12 price plunge, saw more than $21.6 billion in volume – nearly 15 times the high four years ago.      There’s clearly interest in crypto. But what’s driving it might be price volatility and the upcoming halving, rather than speculation that the financial system is nearing any sort of ultimate reckoning.    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    BTC: Price: $8,665 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $9,123 | 24-Hr Low: $8,539      Trend: Bitcoin is witnessing a price dip on Monday, having repeatedly failed to keep gains above $9,000 over the last four days.      The cryptocurrency fell to a low of $8,539 during the Asian trading hours and was last seen trading around $8,665, representing a 2.88% drop on the day.      The downward move may be extended further, possibly to the 200-day average at $8,000, as short-term technical studies are reporting bearish conditions. For instance, the four-hour chart MACD histogram is printing deeper bars below the zero line and is at its lowest level since April 10.      Meanwhile, the 50-hour average, which acted as strong support throughout the rally from $6,800 to $9,400, has been breached. More importantly, the average is now beginning to trend south, a sign of bearish reversal. Similar sentiments are being echoed by the long upper wicks attached to recent daily candles.      The short-term bullish bias would be revived only if the spot price finds acceptance above the trendline falling from June 2019 highs and February 2020 lows – currently located at $9,330. Bulls failed to absorb selling pressure around the trendline hurdle on April 30.      Bitcoin may have a tough time putting in a positive performance during the day ahead, as traditional markets are reporting losses on rising U.S.-China tensions over the origins and handling of the coronavirus pandemic.

42383605,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9xW6j,1588590000,Bitcoin in Emerging Markets: The Middle East,"In advance of her “Crypto Across Emerging Markets” panel at Consensus: Distributed, Leigh Cuen is writing a three-part column on how cryptocurrencies are used in the developing world. In this first part of the series, she looks at the Middle East.      It is a truth universally acknowledged by pundits on Crypto Twitter that emerging markets are more likely to see revolutionary bitcoin usage, at least in the near future, than Silicon Valley.      However, the term “emerging markets” encompasses most of the planet, excluding a handful of wealthy nations. For instance, even if fiat-denominated volumes are dwarfed by Asian whales or U.S. institutions, scrappy crypto traders in Turkey have a disproportionate impact on the global bitcoin economy.      Register: Leigh Cuen Hosts “Crypto Across Emerging Markets” on May 11 at Consensus: Distributed      Generally speaking, regions with weak states and educated diasporas see more grassroots adoption. For example, Lebanese entrepreneur Michel Haber said most of the 26 remote workers involved with his web services startup, cNepho Global, now prefer bitcoin paychecks.      Haber has already been paying some developers this way – with bitcoin from Beirut's grassroots trading networks – for two years. Now that most workers would rather receive bitcoin, he encourages colleagues to get mobile wallets.      This is no longer a fringe outlook.      The Arab Weekly ran a column in April about how the collapsed banking system is destabilizing Lebanon. Protests surrounded the central bank in April, and protests around bank branches even turned deadly. The situation continues to simmer.      “The peer-to-peer bitcoin market is very robust because the Lebanese banking system has failed and people have more cash than the banks do,” Haber said. “Because of coronavirus, you can't really wait at the bank anymore. … They're not sure the Lebanese bank will actually give them the money.”      This doesn’t mean bitcoin will easily replace local currencies, however. As witnessed in Iran, once home to a thriving bitcoin mining industry and retail usage, authorities curtailed usability once mainstream adoption grew.      Read more: Iranian Bitcoiners Risk Fines, Jail Time as Government Regulates Mining      But rather than stamp out demand for cryptocurrency, crackdowns may merely change its manifestation. Some people now use bitcoin for savings and altcoins for transactional alternatives. Markets in places like Iran and Argentina now see increasing demand for stablecoins.      Likewise, Argentinian crypto exchange founder Federico Ogue, CEO of Buenbit and Buendolar, said many users who are buying cryptocurrency for the first time are attracted to dollar-denominated stablecoins.    More coverage on cryptocurrency in the Middle East:  Yemen’s Civil War Shows the Dangers of Crypto  In Palestine, Civilians Are Using Bitcoin More Than Hamas  Despite Bitcoin Price Dips, Crypto Is a Safe Haven in the Middle East  Stablecoin volatility    In regions with volatile currencies and scant access to dollars, demand for stablecoins is up.      According to a bitcoin trader in Iran, who asked to remain anonymous for safety, plummeting oil prices haven’t increased local demand for bitcoin. This is partially due to government efforts to promote the local stock market. Yet, as the dollar exchange rate fluctuates and paper bills become scarce, Tether stablecoins (USDT) sell for more than a dollar’s worth of Iranian rials.      “The government is trying to push financial market demands into Tehran stock exchange to avoid increasing demands in currency or gold markets,” the anonymous Iranian trader said. “Local [crypto] exchanges changed [USDT] rates artificially to get more profit, also demand was so high compared to the low supply of USDT in peer-to-peer exchanges.”      The most desirable aspect of the stablecoin isn’t any stability mechanism or collateral, it’s simply the network effects. After all, the reason many of these users turn to cryptocurrency is because they want a global asset, regardless of whether that takes the form of paper bills or software.

Dapps    The Middle East is also one of the few regions where decentralized applications (dapps) that aren’t focused on gambling are still attracting routine users.      Dmail founder Mohamed Abdou, whose Egyptian team built a privacy-centric email service using Blockstack, said the dapp now has 15,000 active monthly users. As such, Dmail raised a $500,000 seed round in April, an amount which goes much further in Cairo than Silicon Valley.

42383601,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9xW5T,1588588200,"Bitcoin Price May Drop After Halving, Historical Data Shows","Bitcoin has again rallied sharply in the weeks leading up to its impending halving event. But if historic patterns are anything to go by, the cryptocurrency could suffer a temporary price pullback following the supply-altering event.      The top cryptocurrency by market value has risen by over 130% since bottoming out at $3,867 on March 13 according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index. The cryptocurrency jumped from $6,700 to $9,400 in the last 10 days of April alone. What's more, prices gained over 15% last week to register bitcoin's first seven-week winning streak in 12 months.      Notably, the big gains have happened in the weeks leading up to the mining reward halving, due on May 12, and are reminiscent of similar price rallies seen ahead of the previous two halvings, which took place in 2016 and 2012.      See also: Bitcoin Halving, Explained      The term ""halving"" refers to a programmed-in event in bitcoin's code, which reduces the reward per block mined by 50% every four years to control inflation. Following the upcoming halving, rewards issued will drop to 6.25 BTC from the current 12.5 BTC.    Bitcoin’s price performance ahead of halvings    Bitcoin appreciated by 34% from $9.5 to $12.75 in the four weeks to Nov. 28, 2012, when mining rewards were trimmed by 50% for the first time.      The cryptocurrency underwent its second halving on July 9, 2016. On that day, it was trading near $660, representing over 45% gain on the low of $440 observed in mid-May (though it peaked at $780 in mid-June).      Bitcoin also witnessed unprecedented gains in 12 to 15 months following previous halvings. For instance, the cryptocurrency rose to a record high of $20,000 in December 2017.      Some observers expect bitcoin to chart a similar uptrend following the May 2020 supply cut.      “Halving will reduce the amount of bitcoin’s rewarded to miners, thereby reducing the supply of coins entering the market. Not only does halving boost the price as a result of the added scarcity, but the additional media attention and the positive impact this has had on bitcoin prices historically will drive up demand,"" said Don Guo, CEO of Broctagon Fintech Group.      Investors, however, should note that the previous bull runs did not start immediately after halvings. In fact, the 2016 halving was followed by a notable price drop.    Price performance after previous halvings    Bitcoin traded in a sideways manner for over two weeks following its second halving and fell to $465 on Aug. 2 – a loss of nearly 30% from the halving day price of $660.      The fresh record high above $1,160 was set nearly eight months after the supply cut. The upward momentum gathered pace in the following months and prices reached $20,000 in December 2017.      Some investors would argue the cryptocurrency remained bid following its first halving on Nov. 28, 2012. However, back then the community was quite small and primarily consisted of “believers,” who cheered the first supply cut.      That said, prices rose only 6% from $12.75 to $13.50 in the two weeks after halving and remained sidelined in the following five weeks.    Pullback looks likely this time    “The bitcoin halving has been a long-standing topic among the crypto community, with many feeling that any influences on price have already been ‘baked’ into the current price range we’re seeing today,” said Nick Cowan, CEO of the GSX Group, a provider of financial services and exchange ecosystem.      Indeed, the event has been extensively discussed for over a year. CoinDesk published the first article regarding the May 2020 halving on Dec. 31, 2018.      See also: Bitcoin’s Halving Is Irrelevant for Some Large Traders      On-chain data suggests both small and large investors are accumulating coins in the run-up to the event. As a result, a bout of profit taking may be seen after May 12. Some investors, especially short-term traders, may sell their coins after halving, putting downside pressure on prices.      One result of the halving is it will double the cost of mining. Hence, if there is a post-halving price pullback, older-generation mining machines like the Antminer S9s would yield losses, forcing miners to scale back operations or leave the industry. Hard-hit miners may offload their holdings to cover costs, adding to downside pressures around prices.      Some miners may take advantage of the recent price rise by liquidating their crypto earnings over the next 12 days. “That will allow them to keep accumulating bitcoin post-halving,” said Ashish Singhal, CEO, and founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Coinswitch.co.    This time is different      The May 2020 halving is different from the previous two events because it is happening against the backdrop of the coronavirus crisis.      ""This bitcoin halving will certainly be different to the last, as Satoshi Nakamoto’s economic system will have the opportunity to prove its resilience and strength in comparison with traditional Wall Street protocols,"" said Andy Ji, co-founder of Ontology, the public blockchain and distributed collaboration program.      The COVID-19 pandemic has shaken the global economy and forced governments and central banks across the globe to add trillions of dollars of stimulus to the financial system.      The global economy was in relatively better shape when the cryptocurrency experienced its second supply cut in July 2016. Notably, China’s producer price index, or factory-gate prices, bottomed out in the first quarter of 2016 and turned positive in September of that year, triggering a reflationary bull market in commodities and equities.      Put simply, people currently have a strong reason to search for alternatives like bitcoin, which are getting scarcer with every halving. As a result, notable price dips, if any, could be short-lived and the odds of bitcoin setting new highs next year look strong.      “Amid the deteriorating economic outlook for the U.S. economy and the likelihood of an ever-increasing monetary supply, which weakens the dollar and stokes inflation fears, we believe it could easily test previous highs above $19,000 as investors look for safe havens away from traditional assets,” said Simon Peters, a crypto asset expert at global investment platform eToro.    Bitcoin struggles to pass $9K    While bitcoin has put in a solid positive performance ahead of halving, the ascent seems to have run out of steam over the past couple of days.      The cryptocurrency is trading near $8,650 at press time, representing a 3% drop on the day, having failed to keep gains above $9,000 in the last four days, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.      The traditional markets are also flashing red on Monday, with futures tied to the S&P 500 reporting a 0.5% loss. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar is drawing haven demand against the Chinese yuan and growth-linked currencies like the Australian and New Zealand dollars.      So investors are shunning risk, possibly due to the growing conflict over U.S. claims about China's handling of the coronavirus outbreak. If the risk aversion worsens, bitcoin may extend the drop toward the 200-day average at $8,000.      Most analysts, however, still expect the cryptocurrency to test five figures ahead of the halving. ""Though the initial surge to $10K stalled at $9,400, look for a further thrust to break the $10K level followed by a retreat post-halving, with constant forward progress through 2020,"" said Jehan Chu, co-founder and managing partner at Hong Kong-based blockchain investment and trading firm Kenetic Capital.      Chu added that institutional interest and engagement in bitcoin and crypto are at peak levels heading into the critical halving event.      Open interest or open positions in futures listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which is considered synonymous with the institutional activity, rose to $339 million on Friday – the highest level since July 10, 2019, according to data provided by the crypto derivatives research firm Skew. The metric has risen sharply from the low of $107 million observed on March 12.

42383587,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9xVwf,1588584600,US Court Dismisses Lawsuit Over Riot Blockchain's Crypto Pivot,"A New Jersey judge ruled last week that Riot Blockchain's decision to change its name was not, by itself, tantamount to securities fraud.      Judge Freda Wolfson of the U.S. District Court of New Jersey dismissed a lawsuit Thursday that tried to argue the Colorado-based firm changed its name to ""Riot Blockchain"" in an effort to boost its share price.      Riot Blockchain changed its name from Bioptix in October 2017 after announcing a move from biotechnology into bitcoin mining. The share price soon rocketed from $8 to a high of $38 by December 2017. The original complaint – filed in February 2018 when the share price plunged to $10 – argued the company misled investors by capitalizing on public interest in blockchain to drive up the share price.      See also: Riot Blockchain Moves Part of Bitcoin Mining Operation to Upstate New York      But in Thursday's filing, complaints against Riot Blockchain, its CEO John O'Rourke, former CEO Michael Beeghley, and Chairman Jeffery G. McGonegal were dismissed on the basis that plaintiffs had not proven the company had changed its name to pump the share price.      Complaints against Riot Blockchain directors Andrew Kaplan, Jason Les, and Eric So; employees Catherine DeFrancesco, Mike Dai; and private investors Barry Honig, John Stetson and Martin Groussman for their alleged involvement were all dismissed Thursday as well.      The plaintiffs can file a request to produce an amended complaint within 30 days.      In February, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) told Riot Blockchain it, too, was dropping its investigation into allegations of securities fraud.      On the same day the New Jersey suit was dismissed, Riot Blockchain announced the purchase of 1,000 of the latest S19 Bitmain mining rigs, for a reported $2.4 million.

Coming several days before the Senate’s planned return from its COVID-19 recess, the 29-page memo, which is not a proposal to change Senate rules or from the committee that reviews them, preceded the subcommittee’s Thursday roundtable on crisis-time continuity solutions.      Blockchain-based solutions were included on the list of suggestions.      “The Senate may consider blockchain” if its 100 members must vote remotely, staffers wrote. They also proposed voting on end-to-end encryption platforms, and via a military-esque “air-gapped” communications system akin to those presidents and generals use.      Blockchain is perhaps the most controversial of the three suggestions when it comes to remote voting. Over the past year researchers have blasted blockchain and internet-backed voting platforms as insecure and prone to bugs, prompting some election authorities to pull out of plans to use them.      Staffers did not share researchers' fears.      “Although some have raised concerns about the use of online systems for voting, those concerns are more specific to secret ballot elections than they are to public Senate votes,” they wrote.      Read more: 11 Lawmakers Urge US Treasury to Consider Blockchain for COVID-19 Relief      That’s not to say a Senate blockchain would be a completely safe blockchain. The staffers were acutely fearful of a “51 percent attack” scenario in which a malicious actor seized the power of consensus by taking majority control of the voting chain.      Assuming one could prevent a 51 percent attack and also shore up any bugs, cryptographic or otherwise, the staffers were bullish on blockchain voting in the Senate. They wrote that it adds transparency and lowers the risk of incorrect vote tallies.      “With its encrypted distributed ledger, blockchain can both transmit a vote securely and also verify the correct vote,” the memo said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | REGULATION | TRADING | WALLET,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/05/04/us-senate-staffers-float-blockchain-voting-if-chamber-goes-remote,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b1c014a2d37a67798524621c1d3d9c1251ff9030-1500x935.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383611,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9xWEH,1588557659,Crypto Long & Short: Why Bitcoin's Big Rally Is a Sign of Its Economic Resilience,"Economic growth figures are starting to trickle in and, as expected, they’re bad. Really bad. This past week the U.S. reported Q1 GDP growth as -4.8%. Italy’s GDP fell -4.5%, Spain came in at -5.2% and France trumped that with a whopping -5.8%. And that’s just warming up – Christine Lagarde, head of the ECB, has warned euro-area GDP could fall by as much as 15% in Q2.      And yet stock markets in the U.S. and Europe closed up on the week, in spite of the inevitability the next quarter will be worse still.      You're reading Crypto Long & Short, a newsletter that looks closely at the forces driving cryptocurrency markets. Authored by CoinDesk's head of research, Noelle Acheson, it goes out every Sunday and offers a recap of the week – with insights and analysis – from a professional investor's point of view. You can subscribe here.      This could be partly due to the concentration of market capitalization – nearly 25% of the S&P 500 market capitalization is from five tech companies, which arguably will do relatively well from more people staying at and working from home.      Or, it could be because the stock market has broken all ties with the actual economy. The aforementioned concentration of the S&P 500 is intensifying, fueled by the dominance of passive investing, which means its performance does not reflect that of most of its constituents. And the “moral hazard” posed by the government’s willingness to bail out companies in difficulty suspends the need to scrutinize balance sheets and evaluate viability.  But reality doesn’t stay suspended forever, no matter how much we wish it would. Eventually the abrupt slowdown of economic activity will feed through to numbers investors can’t ignore, and the current price/earnings (P/E) valuations will start to look absurd.      This is where bitcoin comes in. Its underlying technology and monetary system make it one of the few investable assets that is immune to the economic fluctuations we have ahead.      First, its P/E ratios will never look absurd because it doesn’t have any earnings. Nothing to get hit there.      Second, its use will not be curtailed by lack of customer mobility – users can transact from anywhere. In fact, logistical constraints could boost interest in bitcoin transactions from those who normally hand over physical cash (although why they would want to if people aren’t moving around is another question).      Third, its market valuation is not susceptible to artificial support from governments trying to keep investor (and voter) spirits up.      This does not mean bitcoin’s price will keep going up while other prices come down. We saw back in March that when things get bad in markets, bitcoin also suffers. Its price is driven by sentiment.      But it is also driven by expectations of future adoption and demand, which are unrelated to the drivers of demand for most other investable assets.      In terms of fundamentals, bitcoin has nothing to lose in the upcoming crisis – no income, no debt and its future adoption does not depend on happy and confident consumers. Just the opposite, in fact.      The growing awareness of this, combined with heightened media attention due to the upcoming halving, could be one of the reasons behind this week’s recovery. Or perhaps it is being swept along in the wave of inexplicable optimism in traditional markets.      Should that turn south, bitcoin is likely to suffer in the sentiment-driven short term. Longer term, however, fundamentals tend to surface, and those that drive bitcoin are radically different from those that drive traditional markets.      Talk about marching to your own beat.    Not that big a deal    One argument in favor of the bitcoin price rallying after the halving is that of supply and demand. Assuming demand is more or less constant (I know, but work with me here), when supply drops the price should go up. Basic economics – you remember that graph from high school, right?      After the halving, there will be fewer new bitcoin entering the market every day. Since miners need to sell part of their hard-won new bitcoins to meet expenses, some of the sell pressure comes from miners. If they are selling fewer bitcoins (because they have fewer bitcoins to sell), then there is less supply meeting a constant demand and the equilibrium price moves up.      Fine, but one part of this model is already obviously unstable – demand is not constant, not by a long stretch.      Even so, there is another overlooked weakness: The dent in sell pressure is negligible.      Post-halving, there will be 6.25 fewer new bitcoins entering circulation with every block. Assuming a new block every 10 minutes, that translates to approximately 900 fewer new bitcoins a day.      Considering the number of bitcoins transferred on-chain in April was an average of over 270,000 per day, 900 less won’t make much of a difference to the supply curve in that simple basic price equilibrium graph.      Any positive halving impact is more likely to come from increased awareness and trader interest resulting from the media attention. The juxtaposition of what is becoming known as a “quantitative hardening” against a “quantitative easing,” combined with growing unease about the latter, is likely to transform this media-fueled attention into a lasting interest from investors, analysts and economists.  What is unclear is whether any price momentum from the halving would be enough to offset a hit to general sentiment from broader macro concern. As always in investing, one’s individual time horizon is everything.    Anyone know what's going on yet?    In spite of a stream of bad news on employment, production and earnings, the S&P 500 had its strongest April since 1987, possibly floating on the stimulus laughing gas. European indices also had a good month, as economies started announcing tentative steps towards opening up their economies and electricity consumption started edging up.      As April turned into May, markets started to retreat, perhaps digesting the recent gains and perhaps unnerved by a new anti-China belligerence from the U.S. and earnings warnings from tech companies. Gold continues to play the inflation game but with less enthusiasm and some profit taking – it remains to be seen how it would perform if stocks head south again. And West Texas oil had its first positive week in about a month as confidence gathered around the production cuts, although there could well be more turmoil there as the next futures expiries approach.      As you can see in the chart above, bitcoin had a particularly strong month.      The jump this week gave bitcoin its best April in years, with data suggesting this rally is largely fueled by U.S. investors, with growth more in spot volumes than derivatives.      And a lack of foreign reserves has pushed countries such as Lebanon and Turkey towards currency crises, which remind us that a strong dollar impacts much more than just FX markets. What’s happening in Lebanon, where anti-government protests have turned violent and triggered the closure of the capital’s banks, will become a textbook example of the risks of centralized finance for years to come.      (Note: Nothing in this newsletter is investment advice. The author owns small amounts of bitcoin and ether.)    Chain links    CoinDesk Research has published its first in a series of deep dives into listed crypto companies. We’re starting with Hut 8, one of the largest listed bitcoin miners, and its financials and recent operational shifts reveal some of the hurdles bitcoin miners struggle with in capitalizing their business while maintaining margins.      Preston Pysh looks at investment opportunities in a market increasingly manipulated by government printing, predicting that a “break” will be triggered either by social unrest or a natural transition to a different form of money. TAKEAWAY: Preston is not a crypto enthusiast (among other things, he hosts the podcast “We Study Billionaires”), but he is bullish on bitcoin largely as an alternative to an increasingly debased dollar – this makes his take particularly interesting for those managing diversified portfolios, which should be everyone.      How many of a project’s contributors have to be hit by a bus for the project to stall? Introducing the “bus factor,” a new metric that measures resilience. Really. TAKEAWAY: Actually, it’s a cool concept, intriguingly expanded on here by analyst Hasu. The higher the bus factor (the more widely distributed the code development), the easier a network is to replicate. The lower the bus factor (the more concentrated its control), the greater the risk. A couple of years ago Twitter woke up to a mercifully false rumor that Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin had been killed in a car accident. (It didn’t involve a bus as far as I know.) The news pushed ether’s price down 15%. These days the impact would probably be different (although please be careful, Vitalik), but the anecdote shows that this is a metric worth watching.      The city of Ya'an, in China's mountainous Sichuan province, is publicly encouraging the blockchain industry to help consume excessive hydroelectricity ahead of the summer rainy season. TAKEAWAY: This highlights how excess energy from hydroelectric and natural gas plants can bring down operating costs for miners, making their sector – crucial to the maintenance of the bitcoin network – more profitable and less vulnerable to price swings and halvings.      Bitcoin futures and bitcoin options both had their most active day since the crash on March 12, according to derivatives data provider skew.com. TAKEAWAY: To be honest, I’m not sure what this means, but it feels significant.      Coin Metrics presents “free float supply,” which adjusts supply measurement by taking out founding tokens and vested tokens, as well as those that are inactive, burned or probably lost. TAKEAWAY: The result is a measure of circulating tokens, a more reliable gauge of a network’s size and liquidity. Bitcoin’s free float supply, according to Coin Metrics, is over 4 million less (over 20% less) than the reported figure, which implies that its velocity (the transaction rate compared to the amount outstanding) is higher than many have calculated.      Blockchain analytics firm Glassnode has introduced a new metric called Glassnode On-Chain BTC Index (GNI), which aims to link price performance to network fundamentals. TAKEAWAY: Any fundamentals-tracking index is subjective, no matter how much rigor goes into selecting and quantifying the components. However, as long as the methodology is consistent, they can provide valuable information about trends and shifts, and at first glance the GNI does a good job of taking into account the principal value drivers of sentiment, liquidity and network health. The index recently turned from bearish to neutral, which is itself a bullish sign.      Large crypto investors, popularly known as “whales,” seem to be accumulating bitcoin amid the ongoing price rally. TAKEAWAY: Although an imperfect indicator, this can be interpreted as bullish, as high-net worth individuals or funds appear to be adding to or taking new long positions in bitcoin, perhaps in response to the monetary turmoil in the fiat world.      Genesis Capital* released its Q1 lending report, which highlights more than $2 billion of new loan originations, twice the figure for the previous quarter. This brings their cumulative amount lent to $6.2 billion. TAKEAWAY: Those are substantial figures, which point to a deepening maturation of the space. The report is worth a read, especially as it gives insight into the timeline around the March 12 crash, and how Genesis handled the turmoil. It also confirms that the lender has tightened credit, given the market uncertainty. This is likely to be temporary and comes as a relief – the sector needs strong lenders, as leverage can fuel growth but can also bring it tumbling down if it has to unwind suddenly. (*Genesis Capital is owned by CoinDesk's parent company, DCG.)      Leigh Cuen spoke to several crypto custody and wallet providers about the uptick in activity they have seen since the beginning of the lockdown. TAKEAWAY: Growing interest in off-exchange custody solutions implies a growing interest in holding crypto assets, rather than just trading them. Some of the exchanges Leigh spoke to cater mainly to institutional clients, but others have a wider base, which implies that interest in bitcoin is spreading amongst all types of investors.      The second fund of a16z’s crypto division has raised $515 million, more than the original target of $450 million and considerably more than the $300 million raised by the first fund, which launched in 2018. The investments will focus on next-generation payments, decentralized finance, new monetization models and the concept of a decentralized internet. TAKEAWAY: While this is a crypto venture fund, investing in startup equity and tokens without the intention to trade, this raise is bullish for the sector as it implies a belief that at least some of the beneficiary blockchain companies will have viable businesses.      Silvergate Bank added 46 crypto customers in the first quarter, bringing the total to 850, largely institutional investors. The number of transactions more than doubled in Q1 vs Q4, and was up more than 3x vs the same period in 2019. TAKEAWAY: One intriguing disclosure in the report was the mention of a lending service called SEN Leverage, currently in pilot mode, which will allow bank customers to obtain U.S. dollar loans collateralized by bitcoin. Crypto as collateral is a fascinating area to watch. On the one hand, the bearer status of bitcoin, its relative liquidity and its ease of transfer make it an ideal collateral from a lender’s point of view. On the other hand, current legislation makes it very difficult in practice. This paper by Xavier Foccroulle Menard, posted on SSRN this week, gives a great explanation as to why. (TL;DR: it’s to do with UCC definitions of collateral – guess what, bitcoin doesn’t fit.)      Hangzhou-based Ebang International Holdings, one of the leading manufacturers of bitcoin mining equipment, has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for an initial public offering of up to $100 million. TAKEAWAY: There does seem to be a trend amongst Chinese companies of trying to list in the U.S., in a bid to broaden their geographical diversification. Curiously, this could encourage the shift of the epicenter of bitcoin mining away from China and towards the U.S.      CFTC commissioner Brian Quintenz, one of the organization’s crypto supporters and who advocated for self regulation in the crypto industry, will not seek renomination when his post ends this month, and will leave the regulatory organization by late October. TAKEAWAY: SEC commissioner Hester Peirce, who has argued in favor of bitcoin exchange-traded funds and also favors a more supportive approach to innovation, is also nearing the end of her term. As far as I know, her plans have not been made clear yet, and we don’t know who will be replacing Quintenz – but this could mark a subtle change in tone at one of the most powerful securities regulators.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Noelle Acheson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/04/crypto-long-short-why-bitcoins-big-rally-is-a-sign-of-its-economic-resilience,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3902a5137937371165b2cf008c26f60ca7560e1e-931x611.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
