42412569,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5NzK,1679355987,Bitcoin Seesaws Around $28K as Investors Await Fed Interest Rate Decision,"Bitcoin lost momentum on Monday, teeter-tottering above and below $28,000 as investors hunkered down in advance of the U.S. Federal Reserve's next interest rate decision on Wednesday.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $27,745, down roughly a percentage point from 24 hours ago. Early Monday (UTC), bitcoin had climbed above $28,400 just hours after the U.S. Federal Reserve announced it had teamed up with five other major central banks to ensure a steady flow of the U.S. dollar, a dominant reserve currency, in the global financial system.  ""Faith in the fiat banking system is waning rapidly and the only alternative, safe haven that is portable is bitcoin,"" Stefan Rust, CEO of data aggregator Truflation, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. ""The rapid rise in the price of bitcoin is a sign of fear that, more problems lurk in the banking sector, particularly since the fall of Credit Suisse.""  Rust added: ""The bank runs we are seeing are also making it difficult to access gold, while fear of inflation and hyperinflation in some countries are all driving a flight to BTC.""  In recent days bitcoin's price has risen as the threat of a global banking meltdown diminished and investor hopes mounted for a more dovish Fed policy, possibly even suspending its year-long streak of interest rate hikes at its Federal Open Market Committee meeting starting Tuesday. A 25 basis point increase seems most probable after last week's only mildly improved inflation report.  ""That's probably most likely,"" Tom Shaughnessy, co-founder of crypto research platform Delphi Digital, told CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program.  Sunday's announcement that the Fed would increase the frequency of the dollar swap lines with the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of England, the Bank of Canada and the Swiss National Bank from weekly to daily, aims to calm exchange volatility and avoid strains in the supply of credit to households and businesses worldwide, as CoinDesk Managing Editor Markets Asia Omkar Godbole reported, adding that ""the increased frequency of swap lines has cleared the way for an unabated rise in risk assets, including bitcoin. The leading cryptocurrency by market value is largely seen as a hedge against the banking system.""  Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency in market capitalization, was recently changing hands at about $1,731, down 3% from Sunday, same time. Other cryptos among the top 25 by market value were largely in the red, with APT, the token of layer 1 network Aptos, and MATIC, the native crypto of layer 2 platform Polygon, recently off more than 8% and 6%, respectively. SOL, the token of the Solana blockchain, rose slightly.  Delphi Digital's Shaughnessy said the driving force behind the current bitcoin surge and its potential sustainability were difficult to determine. He noted that ""this is the first time in history that we have a global banking crisis, and crypto validated to a degree and well known that people can now seek an alternative and go into crypto.""  Laguna Labs' Rust wrote that the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) announcement would likely determine bitcoin's path forward.  ""The only thing holding bitcoin back this week will be the FOMC meeting, with investors nervously awaiting the Fed's next interest rate decision,"" he wrote. He said if the Fed did scale back its current policy, ""markets will be very nervous and it will be a testing time for bitcoin.""  He added: ""Will it keep going in the opposite direction to global markets, or fall back in line? Certainly, the bitcoin maxis believe the former.""",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,James Rubin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/03/20/bitcoin-seesaws-below-28k-as-investors-eye-fed-interest-rate-decision,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7f35690101208803d58f55c0914206b695ccb9cd-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42412574,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5O4w,1679350645,Render Network Eyes Solana Migration Ahead of Network Changes,"The Render Network Foundation on Monday proposed building its new burn-and-mint equilibrium (BME) model on the Solana blockchain, according to a post on the network’s blog.  The BME model, which the community approved last month, requires users to burn a predetermined amount of RNDR, the network’s native token in exchange for non-fungible work credits distributed through node operators. Migrating to Solana could support the BME model’s implementation by accelerating transaction times, mitigating the cost of transactions and offering flexibility to coders, according to the proposal.  “I think if nothing else we need to ensure we get fast speed, but never at the expense of security in the long run,” Render founder Jules Urbach said in a statement.  The Render network currently builds on the Polygon blockchain but has received strong support among its users for a Solana migration. Roughly 55% of users favor making the switch to Solana, while 14% of users would prefer the network remain on Polygon, according to a community sentiment poll included in the proposal. The other 31% of users supported migrations to other blockchains, including Aptos, Ethereum and Algorand, among others.  “The decision whether to continue with Polygon versus moving to Solana sparked a spirited debate between the pros and cons of each, with support for Solana's runtime, developer community, low transaction fees, and speed contrasting Polygon's centralization, reorg tendency, and user experience concerns,” the proposal reads.  The community review period will last for up to 21 days, beginning Monday.

42421308,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnpV7,1679348763,"As ZK Tech Booms in Crypto, Developers Must Consider User Safety","An issue inherent with blockchain systems is their inability to expand without sacrificing security or decentralization – a concept coined by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin as the “blockchain trilemma.”  However, the emergence of zero knowledge (ZK) cryptography promises to transform the way blockchains process, encrypt and share data, offering powerful solutions that address the most formidable scaling challenges.  Stephen Webber works in product marketing at OpenZeppelin, a crypto cybersecurity technology and services company.  ZK technology, such as zk-proofs (ZKP), verifies data without revealing any information beyond that necessary to prove the veracity of the data. This makes them an ideal component in privacy protocols and digital IDs where data privacy is critical.  In the context of blockchain scaling, however, ZKPs can be used in conjunction with rollups to process transaction data off-chain and generate a compact proof to confirm validity – greatly enhancing data efficiency and bringing a potential end to the blockchain trilemma.  Thanks to its unbounded potential across a myriad of services, In recent months, ZK tech has gone from a relative niche to a cornerstone of Web3 infrastructure. From tackling the scaling crisis to bolstering privacy, and even securing one of Web3’s most exploited attack vectors via trustless cross-chain bridges, ZK technology offers far more than many appreciate at this juncture.  But while it lays the technical foundations for the future web, there’s one caveat: These systems need to be well-built and maintained or else risk a security threat of cataclysmic proportions.  Keys to security: airtight code, constant monitoring  See also: Zero-Knowledge Technology Has Great Potential: FS Insight  Ensuring that ZK-powered projects work as intended requires more than just a basic understanding of the technology. Care should be taken to fully account for any low-level discrepancies with respect to EVM [Ethereum Virtual Machine] compatibility and any other details regarding the function of relevant system components  A key aspect of building robust ZK-powered applications involves leveraging well-vetted code from verified smart contract libraries.  By using code from trusted sources, developers can create a solid foundation for their projects without having to reinvent the wheel. These libraries have already been field tested and community approved, reducing the likelihood of errors and vulnerabilities in the final product.  The next major line of defense is proper code auditing. This can’t merely be internal auditing done by the developers themselves. Instead, third-party services need to be employed that publish complete and transparent reports on any and all issues found within the code. These audits also need to be performed regularly, especially when changes are made to the codebase, to ensure updates don't inadvertently introduce errors. Having this level of comprehensive review and transparency is the foundation of keeping all users safe.  Going further, there is a need for systems to perform real-time monitoring of all network activity. Even with the best of auditing, problems can occur that only become apparent after code is deployed and users begin interacting with it (and related protocols) over time.  Often, one of the first signs of an attack happening is unusual on-chain activity. By combining constant monitoring with procedures for developers to take immediate action, the response to such an event could happen in minutes, instead of hours or even days.  See also: ConsenSys, Developer of Ethereum Software, Says zkEVM Public Testnet to Go Live March 28  The use of advanced tooling can also automate security incident response in several key scenarios (e.g., by enabling the circuit breaker-like functionality of smart contract pausing), removing the need for human intervention and avoiding these associated delays.  As more and more financial and data-driven services turn to zero-knowledge technology, ensuring the trustworthiness of these systems becomes increasingly crucial. Those services that prioritize user safety and take a comprehensive approach to security will lead the industry and win the trust of the growing percentage of users who seek greater agency and control over their funds and their personal data.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | ZK,Stephen Webber,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/03/20/as-zk-tech-booms-in-crypto-developers-must-consider-user-safety,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/85cdb3a3f8e54d2c2a5e7dd1d207e2428c7f68ce-1658x932.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Pixelcraft Studios said it will receive 25%, or $7.5 million, of the treasury while the protocol’s decentralized autonomous organized (DAO) treasury will receive the remaining $22.5 million.  ""The successful conclusion of this sale represents a watershed moment for the decentralized fundraising space and, we hope, a model for responsible fundraising for projects in the future,” said Coder Dan, co-founder and CEO of Pixelcraft Studios, in a press release. “We are thrilled to have such a strong and passionate community behind us and are excited about the potential of AavegotchiDAO receiving the lion's share of this raise.”  Pixelcraft Studios began the sale of its native Aavegotchi token, GHST, in September 2020. Using a decentralized funding mechanism created by Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, users deposited the stablecoin DAI into a smart contract in order to earn GHST before the token sale concluded.  However, earlier in March, the depegging of DAI in the wake of the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank pushed the community to end the token sale earlier than anticipated in fear of token instability.  Aavegotchi is a decentralized Web3 ecosystem that utilizes non-fungible tokens (NFT) and decentralized finance (DeFi). The community recently voted to increase its in-game wearable offerings for Aavegotchis, or digital pets that can be used within the game’s ecosystem.",POSITIVE,DAI,ETH | REGULATION | SPONSORED | DAI | TOKEN SALE,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/03/20/creators-behind-web3-game-aavegotchi-raise-30m-in-multi-year-long-token-sale,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8a520b809f7c6bb305f5a2bd1683c3e42c4c2e52-1268x710.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42414163,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAx6Hh,1679346045,Core Scientific Bankruptcy Judge Approves Transfer of Over $20M of Equipment to Its Exclusive Energy Negotiator,"The judge in Core Scientific's (CORZ) bankruptcy case approved a settlement with the bitcoin miner's exclusive energy contract negotiator under which Core Scientific will transfer more than $20 million worth of electrical equipment to the supplier.  The dispute relates to two facilities in west Texas that were supposed to cumulatively bring 1 gigawatt (GW) of power capacity to Core Scientific's portfolio of assets. Starting in the summer of 2021, Priority Power Management was hired as the miner's ""exclusive energy manager and consultant,"" with responsibilities including negotiating power contracts and the build out of the two west Texas sites, according to a declaration filed with the court from Michael Bros, the miner's senior vice president of capital markets and acquisitions.  However, as of May 2022, after ""it became clear that the [two west Texas] facilities would not receive the anticipated power load,"" Core Scientific stopped making various payments to Priority Power Management, Bros said. Neither firm immediately replied to CoinDesk's request for comment as to why the power was not delivered.  The miner also halted debt payments in October 2022 as it was running low on cash. In December, it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.  Due to the work it had performed for Core Scientific up to the bankruptcy filing, Priority Power Management claimed it was owed about $30 million in the proceedings.  Technically, the deal will see Priority Power Management ""get an allowed secured claim for $20.8 million, which is going to be deemed paid in full by the transfer of all the debtors' interest in the equipment,"" said federal Judge David Jones of the Southern District of Texas at a Monday hearing. Secured claims take priority over other types of claims in a bankruptcy.  The equipment in question actually cost around $23 million, and about $17 million of it is already in Priority Power Management's possession.  Under the deal, the consulting firm will loosen its exclusivity in procuring power agreements for Core Scientific, but keep $514,000 it earned by power curtailment for the miner. Core Scientific will also reimburse $85,000 of legal and out-of-pocket expenses to the consulting firm.  The two facilities appear to be up for sale, and Core Scientific ""will introduce"" Priority Power Management to any acquirer so that they can negotiate a similar deal, according to the Bros declaration.  A spokesperson for the miner said Monday that ""the Priority Power Management settlement does not affect that [sale] process.""  Core Scientific had previously said it would sell two facilities that are currently under development with up to 1 GW of power capacity as part of the bankruptcy proceedings.

42414173,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAx73S,1679343760,U.S. Supreme Court to Hear First Crypto Case Tuesday,"The U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments in its first-ever crypto-related case on Tuesday, when lawyers for San Francisco-based crypto exchange Coinbase will attempt to convince the nine Justices to pause a pair of class-action lawsuits against the crypto exchange.  Though the case the high court will hear Tuesday involves crypto, it is not itself a crypto case. Instead, this case is a fairly esoteric, procedural argument over whether a lawsuit can proceed in federal court while one party – in this case, Coinbase – is attempting to send the dispute to arbitration.  Coinbase is in the process of appealing an earlier decision by a federal court in California allowing the two lawsuits, Bielski v. Coinbase and Suski v. Coinbase, to continue, in contrast with Coinbase’s user agreement, which requires disputes to be sent to arbitration. Arbitration is an out-of-court method of dispute resolution in which the odds are often unfairly stacked against consumers.  The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California denied Coinbase’s motion to compel arbitration in the Bielski case last April, arguing the exchange’s arbitration clause as written is “unconscionable” and uses a “litigation gimmick” to disadvantage users in the case of a dispute. When Coinbase appealed with the next-highest court, the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in July, the decision was upheld.  Coinbase has become something of a magnet for class-action lawsuits, with judges swatting down some attempts and allowing others to forge ahead. The suits have covered a wide range of issues, from allegations the exchange sold unregistered securities (after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission deemed certain tokens to be securities) to claims the exchange mishandled its public listing.  Still other lawsuits have been tied to complaints about hacks and lax security, including Bielski’s, which alleged that Coinbase broke the law in failing to reimburse him for over $31,000 he lost after being targeted by a scammer posing as a PayPal representative.  The other case the Supreme Court will review on Tuesday, Suski v. Coinbase, concerns a million-dollar sweepstakes event the exchange held in June 2021. Suski and other customers say they were misled by advertising that suggested they needed to buy or sell $100 in dogecoin for a chance to win, when in reality users who didn’t trade dogecoin were also eligible.  As the lawsuits continue to mount, Coinbase has been forced to play an increasingly frantic game of legal whack-a-mole. If the exchange gets its desired outcome from the Supreme Court, future suits could be forced into arbitration – which makes it easier for Coinbase to deal with them.  Though the eventual decision will not set a precedent either way for the most important issues facing crypto, it could have a significant impact on the emerging litigation landscape in the crypto sphere. It would also have wide-ranging implications for other crypto companies that have increasingly been targeted by class-action lawsuits.  The court will convene in Washington, D.C., at 10:00 a.m. ET on Tuesday, with this case the second on the docket. Oral arguments are expected to last 60 minutes.",NEUTRAL,없음,DOGE | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/03/20/us-supreme-court-to-hear-first-ever-crypto-case-tomorrow,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/51e4c497a68d1977349b5d13f16f9c4322b57771-4032x2268.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42410999,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ghvTmo,1679343608,"Bitcoin, Ether Trade Lower After Breaching Technical Indicator","Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) retreated in Monday trading following a weekend breach of a popular technical indicator.  Bitcoin and ether prices surpassed the upper range of their respective Bollinger Band, with the assets trading above $28,000 (bitcoin was more recently trading nearer to $27,900) and $1,795, respectively. BTC’s breach occurred on Sunday, while ETH’s occurred on Friday.  Bollinger Bands measure an asset’s 20-period moving average and subsequently plot two standard deviations above and below the average price.  Since an asset’s price is expected to stay within two standard deviations of its average 98% of the time, a breach of its upper or lower bound is a noteworthy event.  The most recent occurrence for BTC took place over nine consecutive days between Jan. 8 and Jan. 16. Prices increased 23% over the same period and rose an additional 12% in the following 13 days.  ETH had a similar run between Jan. 4 and Jan. 16, with 11 breaches over 13 days, and a 29.7% price increase.  Whether prices will subsequently trend higher, or revert to the 20-day average price will be a key trend to watch in upcoming days Currently, the latter has begun to occur.  Wednesday’s upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) rate hike decision could affect prices as well. Investors may be less likely to add exposure this close to potentially market moving news.  Trading volume ahead of the decision will be important for investors to watch. Currently, both BTC and ETH trading volumes have decreased from a week prior, but they remain near their 20-day averages.  Significant declines in volume would imply that investors are waiting on the Fed decision, and subsequent comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, before taking a definitive stance.  Correlations begin to shift  In an early sign of how the market is viewing BTC and ETH this week, correlations between the two largest crypto currencies and the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) are more negative.  The correlation coefficient between BTC and the DXY has moved from -0.25 to -0.70, indicating an increasing inverse relationship between the two. Correlation coefficients range between 1 and -1, with the former indicating a direct pricing relationship, and the latter indicating a completely inverse one.  BTC’s correlation with the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite has increased from 0.33 to 0.50 over the same period.  While a 0.50 correlation is relatively moderate, its trajectory higher is worth monitoring, particularly as the relationship with the DXY is inverting.  A short-term “recoupling” of the relationship between BTC and traditional finance indexes would indicate that the upcoming Fed decision could significantly affect prices.

42421080,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXWRiv,1679338588,Eva Beylin: NFTs Are Empowering to Artists,"Often we don’t take our side hobbies as seriously as we'd want. We skip those guitar lessons, the baking book we bought is now covered in dust, the new running shoes are hiding in the closet and, almost always, we promise ourselves we’d do better next time.  So imagine when your side hobby suddenly becomes an integral part of your professional life, giving you an edge that most might not have. That’s what happened when Eva Beylin, director of The Graph, who couldn’t believe that non-fungible tokens (NFT) could be a way for her to become an artist.  Eva Beylin, director of The Graph Foundation, is a speaker at CoinDesk's Consensus festival in April.  “I've now been able to sell my art, which would have never happened before if I was just casually doing it because I'm not a big artist. I don't do this full time. To me, that’s incredibly empowering.”  There’s more to Eva’s portfolio than her art. With her background in economics and a career in Web3, Eva Beylin represents the modern-day crypto leader. Not to mention, Elon Musk retweeted her meme, which she eventually sold as an NFT, making nearly $20,000. Talk about seizing the moment.  Currently working with an indexing protocol for blockchain data called The Graph, Beylin has led the distribution of over $135 million in grants to The Graph's core developers. She is also a member of the influential Web3 venture capital fund called eGirl Capital.  eGirl Capital is a digital native brand and a venture capital that was founded by 14 acquaintances on Telegram. Its portfolio includes Arbitrum, Yat (the emoji identity startup) and Radicle (a decentralized platform for developers). Fun fact: Most partners in eGirl to this day remain pseudonymous to each other.  “A lot of the people who are pseudonymous in crypto are not anonymous to their core. They've built an identity around a specific expertise or a job or a skill set that they want to then emulate. And it's very possible they have multiple identities,” said Beylin.  But as the world embraces the world of crypto and Web3, the technological shift is not as easy it seems. Many stay curious about the upcoming challenges the industry may face. So we reached out to Eva Beylin to understand the future of Web3, why NFTs matter and, most importantly, to get a Twitter tip or two.  (Interview has been edited for clarity.)  CoinDesk: How does it feel when you can combine your interest in art with technology like NFTs?  My background is in economics, which was my first love, and with Ethereum [that] was sort of realizing how we can use it for payments and rethinking our financial systems. Art was more like a side hobby and a surprising consequence of my interest in crypto. I didn't expect that when I would join Ethereum that I would be able to become a side hobby artist because I've now been able to sell my art, which would have never happened before. You know, if I was just casually doing that, because I'm not a big artist. I don't do this full time. To me, it's incredibly empowering.  What are your opinions on NFT royalties?  I think this topic is really controversial because the term “royalty” is being misunderstood to mean a specific implementation. Whereas the plain definition of royalties is just a recurring financial payment for some kind of IP [intellectual property] or copyright usage. And so, it sounds like a lot of the artists that joined crypto, bought into this idea that royalties are a percentage of the sale explicitly extracted at the time of you’re making that transaction. And that let a lot of people down.  We should be rethinking how we can create recurring payments to creators as a concept. It doesn't have to be a percentage of the NFT sale because there are some limitations to that. But can we think of new ways of actually creating that revenue? And the reason I think this is important is because it's beyond our current creator economy. For example, if we think of authors who write books, their whole business model is built off the idea of recurring payments. So if we're saying that publishing is fundamentally incompatible with Etheruem, I resent that.  A lot of the people who are pseudonymous in crypto are not anonymous to their core. They've built an identity around a specific expertise or a job or a skill set  And do you think that NFT royalty should be programmatically enforced on-chain?  I think that question is very nuanced, because to simply enforce them with the NFT has a lot of limitations that they're not fully enforced. I think that dapps should do their best to enforce them for social reasons. You know, ultimately, when we think about the value of the NFT market it's about the artists' creations, and if artists aren't funded they're not going to create things. When it comes to programmatically enforcing, this is where I think we need more innovation because there are limitations with wrapping those NFT contracts, whether or not you can actually enforce a payment at the time of sale or transfer. So that's kind of what I'm saying is a very primitive view of royalties and we need to be thinking what is that next mechanism that can not make royalties possible.  Speaking of NFTs, how is your NFT portfolio doing? Do you have anything that has surpassed Elon Musk retweet experience?  I have not. It was definitely the combination of the retweet and also being able to sell it that’s why I won the internet that day. But I am really, really big into collecting art simply because I really like art. So I have not stopped collecting, especially finding new artists. One of my hobbies on Twitter is to find an artist that seems really exciting. I am interested in the open edition and the additions trend. I think that we're going to see less-open editions in the future and more curated editions because of the benefits that creators have by informing their community or providing opportunities for their community.  And is eGirl Capital still active in the bear market?  We're always active and passive at the same time. Most members have other full-time jobs or other focus areas. So we continue to invest in whatever is interesting to us. I believe we invested in “Oh Baby Games” just a few months ago.  What about The Graph? What are the challenges you’ve faced there?  We're always learning and growing. I sometimes can't believe it's been more than two years since we launched the network. But I would say the biggest challenge is estimating the time it takes to make progress in Web3 technologically. It's just that there's so many unpredictable things that come up with building these new sets of infrastructure that we're kind of seeing across that board. There might be an issue in some kind of node client that then affects our ability to serve that data, until it becomes a larger sentiment that we still have a lot of work to do on the infrastructure.  Do you think pseudonymous identities on Web3 will be able to gain trust of the public?  I come from management consulting working in New York and I definitely recognize wanting a little bit more of a traditional identity KYC [know-your-customer] structure. However Web3, as part of its overall movement, provides access and openness. And part of that openness is to people choosing different identities, openness to people living their lives in different ways. I think there's definitely reasons to not trust certain individuals, whether anonymous or not and sometimes that has come up in scams. But there's also a lot that you gain from just having an identity that is a brand.  Would you ever consider getting a pseudonymous identity for yourself?  I was already public so that's partially why I'm not pseudonymous. However, I do have some anon accounts. And I don't see any issues with that. I think it creates much more opportunity for people to actually express themselves in nontraditional ways. Whereas historically, you really only had one job and you were only really allowed to do that one job.  What are you most excited about Consensus this year?  Oh, good question. The past year has been pretty challenging for most projects, and especially builders. And so I'm really looking forward to refocusing on what it is that builders need to get us to the next step. We are basically ready for our prime time. And now it's just finishing these last few bits. So I'm looking forward to insightful conversations, maybe even if it emulates a salon type of environment. That would be exciting.  We’re excited about that, too.

It is also important that crypto and financial innovation stays under the guidance of U.S. regulators, she said.  “It's critical to be able to not only enforce against actors that are acting poorly, but also to provide very clear paths under supervision so that we can encourage the innovation to happen here,” House said.  House, who is chairwoman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s new Technology Advisory Committee, said her committee is trying to figure out the “practical reality of what the developments in the technologies look like [and] where the greatest risks are.”  By getting a better handle on the emerging technologies, House said, the committee may be able to give the CFTC more concrete recommendations on regulatory frameworks and policy guidelines.  “The U.S. financial system really sits at the heart of so many parts of the toolbox of U.S. national security tools and capabilities,” House said. “Anything that potentially weakens the sector could be a concern.”  Ahead of the committee’s first meeting on Wednesday, the group will discuss technology policy, the legal implications related to decentralized finance and artificial intelligence and cybersecurity for commodity and derivatives markets, she said.

Earlier this month, participants in Origin’s on-chain governance approved a three month freeze to the 1.25% tax on NFT sales conducted through Origin Story, the protocol’s brand-focused NFT marketplaces service.  That move placed Origin Story in direct competition with OpenSea and Blur, the top two NFT marketplaces that are currently waging a zero-fee war to woo digital collectibles traders. Origin framed its own fee reduction as an effort “to gain market share at this critical time.”  “We will have a short-term reduction of platform revenues that would otherwise have been awarded to OGN stakers” because of the fee freeze, the subsidies proposal read.  At press time, Origin’s website dashboards showed the protocol’s rewards pools for both ETH and OGN were fully depleted, indicating there were no tokens available to pay out to OGN stakers.  “If this proposal passes,"" the proposal continued, ""we invite the community and other team members to submit more specific proposals on ETH and/or OGN budget to allocate into the pool.”  With hours left in the voting, the subsidies proposal appeared likely to pass. At press time, 27 holders of Origin’s OGN tokens had voted over 1 million tokens in favor of passage, and none against. At least three participating addresses were associated with employees of Origin Protocol. Together, they comprised over 50% of the voting power.

42421302,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnpU5,1679327049,Credit Suisse’s Buyout Shows Banks Still Have a Banking Problem,"Time to add Credit Suisse (CS) to the list of bank failures we’ve seen so far in 2023.  Over the weekend UBS agreed to buy Credit Suisse for what equates to about $3.25 billion of UBS stock complete with the Swiss government helping absorb some of the coming writedowns of CS’s loan book. UBS had to step in to save CS after last Wednesday's 50 billion Swiss franc liquidity injection from the Swiss National Bank proved insufficient to buoy the bank’s operations once the Saudi National Bank (CS’s largest shareholder) said it wouldn’t provide any more assistance.  We’ve come full circle: During the last financial crisis in 2008 it was UBS that was saved by the long arm of the Swiss government. This time the government needed UBS to lend a helping hand.  There are many financial system and banking system takes to be had here, but here’s a crypto-focused one.  Despite its lofty side quest to disrupt finance, it wasn’t crypto that upended these banks and it certainly didn’t upend Credit Suisse. Bankers were so busy laughing at crypto's unraveling they didn't realize their banks were also unraveling.  Instead of failing because Bitcoin made banking services obsolete, Credit Suisse failed because it wasn’t good at being a bank. Remember in 2021 when Credit Suisse took $5.5 billion of losses on loans in connection to Archegos? And remember how it was embroiled in enough fraud in 2014 that it had to pay $2.6 billion to the United States Department of Justice?  Some other stuff happened and then Credit Suisse was forced to sell itself to a competitor at a steep discount.  All the while, bitcoin’s price is trending up as banks fail simply because they are being banks. This is really the first time the narrative of bitcoin as a way to opt out of unadvisable banking practices is playing out as we would have expected.  Banks are failing because they are bad at being banks and the Bitcoin blockchain is completely separate from those failures. Bitcoin is on the outside looking in on the mess and offers itself as a genuine means to opt out.

42393755,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpA1kH,1679323748,No Crypto Banking Port Has Really Opened Up in This U.S. Storm,"The biggest U.S. banks haven't stepped forward to welcome homeless crypto businesses scrambling for banking services after fleeing the wreckage of Silvergate Bank, Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank.  CoinDesk asked the top 20 U.S. banks by assets if they were taking on crypto customers, especially those businesses that recently lost their banking homes in the recent carnage. Most of them remained silent on the question. Some – including JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), Bank of New York Mellon (BK) and Morgan Stanley (MS) – declined to comment.  Others were open about saying they aren't comfortable taking on crypto clients.  KeyBank (KEY), a regional lender based in Ohio, is between Silicon Valley and Signature in scale, so around the size of the institutions that crypto clients have been accustomed to using. But a spokeswoman there said the bank is focusing on those that meet its “moderate risk profile.”  “Crypto-focused firms do not fall within this category at this time,” she said.  And Citizens Financial Group (CFG), which is among the larger regional banks, said it doesn’t have “direct credit exposure to crypto/digital asset businesses, and it’s not something we’re looking to get into at this time,” according to a spokesman.  The panic over the collapse of tech-oriented banks – marking two of history’s largest government bank takeovers with Signature and Silicon Valley, plus a more recent cash infusion to First Republic Bank (FRC) from its banking peers – flooded the industry with businesses looking for places to handle their banking.  The banks CoinDesk surveyed represent about $13 trillion in assets – or about 56% of the U.S. banking sector. Not even BNY Mellon – known to handle custody for crypto companies’ assets, such as much of the liquid cash in stablecoin issuer Circle Internet Financial’s reserves – chose to openly address the situation, even though it has expanded its Circle business amid the turmoil.  Careful banks  The largest U.S. bank, JPMorgan, hasn’t slammed the door on crypto companies, but it’s being especially careful with any new customers, according to a person familiar with the situation. It won’t take on any full-on crypto businesses, but it’s still willing to extend basic banking services to a handful of companies that touch the industry, the person said, such as firms investing in some crypto projects.  JPMorgan has a complicated history with big digital-assets firms. The Wall Street banking giant has been severing business ties with Gemini, as CoinDesk first reported earlier this month, but it still maintains its working relationship with crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN). And while CEO Jamie Dimon is famously critical of digital assets, his bank has also experimented with high-level use of blockchain technology and its own internal token.  Citigroup is taking a similar approach as its rival at the moment. The doors are still open at Citi for new customers that can clear its due-diligence standards, but it’s not going near hard-core, crypto companies, such as token issuers, a person familiar with its approach said.  Industry insiders have been swapping hints about other banks – such as some foreign institutions that do business in the U.S. – they think might still be open to crypto companies. A person at one major crypto company said that more than two dozen U.S. banks are still doing business with the industry, even if it’s not openly advertised.  When Circle lost some of its banking partnerships. For instance, it turned to a tiny institution in New Jersey, Cross River Bank, that was known to do business with tech investment firms.  “As long as a crypto company can demonstrate its ability to be a good bank customer, it should be able to be banked,” said Sheila Warren, CEO of the Crypto Council for Innovation.  Risky clients  There’s also a risk that the very act of flagging friendly banks could open them up to questions about their own strengths.  While banks struggle under a rush of customer applications, they are also dealing with their industry’s unsteadiness, with the KBW index’s measure of bank stocks sliding about 22% from the point at which Silvergate began faltering two weeks ago. So crypto companies have been showing up at the doors of financial institutions that are themselves shaken by what’s been going on.  The banks are also unsure exactly which customers they can offer a hand to without it getting slapped by their regulators.  Whether the volatility or business practices of the crypto sector contributed to the failures of the industry’s favorite banks, the surviving institutions are under directives to be wary of digital assets. Since the collapse of FTX, leaders of the Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency have expressed relief that they had resisted letting cryptocurrencies into the banking system. In recent months, they have solidified that position by warning the lenders they oversee that those that focus on crypto clients aren’t likely to convince their government supervisors that they are running a safe-and-sound bank.  Most of the banks are taking these statements to heart, and some insiders – such as former House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank, who is a board member at Signature – have more pointedly accused regulators of gunning for crypto.  When asked if they could provide more clarity on what kind of crypto business exposure might be acceptable at the banks they oversee, spokespeople for the Federal Reserve and FDIC declined to go any further than the statements they have put out in recent months.  Officials from both agencies have been called to a March 29 hearing of Frank’s old House committee to explain what happened with Signature and Silicon Valley.  For customers of those banks, federal authorities blunted some of this month’s panic when the FDIC stepped in to take charge of them and open up its deposit insurance to cover all the normally uninsured customers – a cohort that the bulk of the crypto clients fit into. Over the weekend, New York Community Bancorp (NYCB) stepped in to take over Signature’s non-crypto deposits, leaving an open question about the $4 billion in deposits still in limbo from its digital-assets business.  And federal officials have continued to try to calm the financial sector. Wally Adeyemo, deputy secretary of the U.S. Treasury Department, told CNBC last week that “deposit flows have stabilized in regional and small banks,” and in some cases they have “modestly reversed.” He credited that to the government’s aggressive move to protect uninsured depositors.  But banks are also seeing how charged up their critics are, such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who hammered former Signature CEO Joseph J. DePaolo in a letter that cited “gross mismanagement that resulted in the bank’s failure.” She argued that the bank “embraced crypto customers with insufficient safeguards.”  The senator ended her letter with the question, “Why did you fail to adhere to regulators’ warnings about the risks associated with the crypto industry?”",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/03/20/no-crypto-banking-port-has-really-opened-up-in-this-us-storm,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bdcc97b42f9692e1b34a3ca0416f81d5c7c490f8-5486x3086.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421235,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXhqv7,1679323184,Senator Cynthia 'Crypto Queen' Lummis: Lack of Laws Pushing Industry Overseas,"When did you start thinking about crypto? Odds are you were later to the party than U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis, (R-Wyo.) who bought her first bitcoin way back in 2013. “I wish I would have bought a hundred,” she says now. “Instead, I think I bought three.”  Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY.) is a speaker at CoinDesk's Consensus festival in April.  This is one reason she’s been dubbed the Senate’s “Crypto Queen.” Another is that last year she worked with Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) to introduce the bipartisan “Responsible Financial Innovation Act,” aimed at creating a regulatory framework for the industry.  Then came the implosion of the FTX exchange, the crash of cryptocurrency prices and the bracing cold of crypto winter. The onslaught of negative news had a real impact. FTX and other failures had a “chilling effect” on Congress’ appetite to draft policy, says Lummis, but she remains confident legislators will get something done in this session of Congress.  Specifically, Lummis plans to unveil a new-and-improved bill (again with Sen. Gillibrand) as early as April, which she describes as both “lighter and meatier.” Whereas the original bill proposed some studies, the new bill will propose more “statutory language.”  The failure of the United States Congress to enact policy is pushing the industry to other countries.  Will it work? Does it have a chance to get signed into law? In an exclusive Zoom interview with CoinDesk, Lummis explains what draws her to cryptocurrency, argues why the industry needs a regulatory framework ASAP and drops some tantalizing clues as to what we can expect from her legislation. How will it handle the trillion-dollar question of what counts as a security or a commodity? Does she think the legislation will pass? We ask the senator, point blank, on a scale from 1 to 10, how likely is it that we’ll see a bill signed into law. (Her answer might surprise you.)  Interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.  What first sparked your interest in bitcoin and crypto?  Senator Cynthia Lummis: Well, I'm a debt and deficit hawk, so having been in the U.S. House [of Representatives] and watching our debt grow, and without adequate attention and concern to it, I was always looking for a way out. Is there an exit ramp? And I started seeing bitcoin as a possible way to resolve the problems we're having with U.S. debt and deficits. Then my new son-in-law helped me buy bitcoin.  I’ve read you first purchased bitcoin in 2013. Is that accurate?  Yeah. I wish I would have bought a hundred; instead, I think I bought three.  And later I went to the Satoshi Roundtable in 2017. I had just left Congress. I was invited to Satoshi to talk about how Congress works, not to talk about bitcoin, because I didn't really know much about it. And I got hooked. It was a year when the Satoshi Roundtable was discussing the forks [from the Bitcoin blockchain], and it was a consequential year in terms of policy discussions.  So there we were in Cancun, and I never went out on the beach. We were in a windowless conference room and I was just learning about this technology and became fascinated by it.  What excites you, specifically, about the technology? Why are you so bullish?  Well, it's permissionless. I don't have to trust other people to hold my money. I think it's a great store of value. The fact that it is mined is a concept that, coming from Wyoming, is very familiar to me. Wyoming is a mining state. We understand the value of things that are stored in the ground. So it was not a big leap for me to appreciate the value of something stored on a blockchain, where I could actually have a node that has the entire ledger on the computer that I can see. So if the whole system goes down but my node is working, the whole system is preserved.  The notion of a store of value matters to me, coming from a state that has minimal assets – gold and trona, and things that can be taken from the ground and converted to dollars. While they’re in the ground there’s still a store of value. That made sense to me because I see bitcoin as a store of value. I also came to appreciate the concept of fast money and slow money, or “low time preference” and “high time preference.” So as a buy-and-hold strategy it makes sense to me. What does not make sense to me is some of the ways that people try and trade it.  Well said. And your eloquence discussing the space is one reason you’ve been called the “Crypto Queen.” What do you think of that moniker? Love it or hate it?  [Laughs.] You know, at first it was kind of embarrassing, but now I accept it as a compliment because I think the people who use that are really genuinely supportive of what we're trying to do – which is create a regulatory framework that is understandable but that won't kill the industry. And what's happening right now is [that] the failure of the United States Congress to enact policy is pushing the industry to other countries. Europe is ahead of us in terms of its regulatory framework. Australia and the U.K. are getting ahead of us. Switzerland is far ahead of us. So we've got some catching up to do.  To that point, what’s the status of the legislation that you introduced last year with Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand?  We're going to reintroduce it in April, probably mid-April. It'll be lighter and meatier. We’re shoring up some of the definitions, for example, that the [Securities and Exchange Commission] wasn't crazy about.  So, we've been working with the SEC staff to see if we could get something more concrete in law, and that should be helpful to the industry as well in terms of determining what is a commodity and what is a security, and not leaving it to the regulators alone to sort of make that determination, [which leads to] having an encounter with them to argue that they've made the wrong determination.  So it's more robust, I would say. [The legislation has] been on a diet and it's been on exercise, so it's meatier and a little shorter, but we also have tried to address some issues that we think are important to address. From the original bill where we were proposing some studies, we're now proposing more statutory language, because even our depth of understanding [has grown], and our feeling [is that] Congress needs to and is ready to weigh in on some of those concepts.  Europe is ahead of us in terms of its regulatory framework.  Can you give an example, Senator?  Well, ours proposed a study on the digital yuan, and the whole notion of central bank digital currency. The Biden administration has put together a working group, it seems, to explore CBDC. Senator Gillibrand and I, I think, are in agreement that a central bank digital currency should not be direct to retail.  That's the purpose of a stablecoin. And so, we're hopeful that our approach will be well understood and make sense to our colleagues. We nearly had a stablecoin bill put together in the last Congress, but we just ran out of time and runway to get it done.  But we do think there's a pretty good understanding within the committees of jurisdiction that a stablecoin should be the direct to retail side of the equation. And if the U.S. has a CDBC, that it just be a means for the U.S. to engage with other central banks around the world.  You’re facing strong headwinds in both polarization in Congress and crypto winter, with all the FTX and doom-and-gloom headlines. Given both of these challenges, how optimistic are you that you can actually pass something?  I remain optimistic. And I couldn't agree more that FTX and some other colossal failures last year had a chilling effect on Congress' appetite to engage in policy regarding cryptocurrency.  What’s the case for optimism?  Simply because Senator Gillibrand and I remain committed to this. We're working with both the chair of the House Financial Services Committee, [Rep. Patrick] McHenry )R-N.C.], as well as French Hill [R-Ark.], who is heading the subcommittee on crypto on the House side. We continue to work every week with our colleagues here, explaining to them what the bill's going to look like when we reintroduce it in April, so they know what's coming. We’re continuing to communicate with industry, communicating on a bipartisan basis. Senator Gillibrand and I are still very committed to this. We want this to happen.  We need to ramp up in the minds of people a sense of urgency. Because this industry is very nimble and can drop anchor anywhere in Europe, [where they] already have a regulatory framework that's getting fleshed out much faster than we are. So the uncertainty is going to cause problems for us, if we want to maintain our position as the world’s financial leader.  I just came from a discussion with a firm that is hiring in the U.K. as opposed to in the U.S., simply because our regulatory framework is not fleshed out.  Thank you, Senator. Last question. If you had to quantify your confidence in passing legislation on a scale of 1 to 10, where 10 is a rock-solid “we’re passing this thing!” and one is “no chance in hell,” what number do you give it?  I'm a 7 for this year and a 10 for the next two years.  Love the optimism. Thank you, Senator, and best of luck.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Jeff Wilser,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/03/20/senator-crypto-queen-lummis-cryptocurrency-bill,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/547299d688d869320719e5247fc83d1176dc96e0-1920x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin production increases sharply. Strong potential for this to continue going forward. The higher the stock goes here (without accompanying profitability), the greater the risk. We continue to watch two trends discussed below to ascertain how high MARA shares will trade going forward. Intro We wrote about Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc. ( MARA ) back in late January of this year when we recommended selling call ratio spreads or indeed broken wing butterflies. These options strategies really work well when stocks are undergoing trending moves and rich option skew is evident as the probability of profit comes in well over 75% in many cases. In fact, given the 40%+ short interest ratio at the time, we favored the broken-wing butterfly strategy to minimize upside risk in this play (Short-Squeeze Possibility). Short-term upside potential was the reason for this strategy and although we had to wait some time for the up move to materialize, shares finally rallied and currently find themselves 11%+ above the share price when we initiated the position. In fact, March has been an excellent month for the stock thus far compounded by the gains post the announcement of the company's fourth-quarter earnings results . Although the financial performance of Marathon was poor in the fourth quarter with respect to the sizable net loss, the rising price of Bitcoin continues to raise all boats with Marathon Digital being no exception. In fact, given the company's encouraging operating performance in the fourth quarter, speculators continue to view MARA as an attractive leveraged play on Bitcoin. As alluded to above, the reasons behind this are operational and not financial. To this effect, Marathon actually increased its Bitcoin production in fiscal 2022 by 30% with Q4 production ending up being a record quarterly number. This growth essentially stemmed from Marathon's shift to renewable power and the ability to lock in more favorable hosting contracts. Suffice it to say, with these levels of production numbers, speculators continue to gain some significant leverage to the upside. Nevertheless, leverage as we know is a double-edged sword which means that long-term investors need to be mindful of the following areas to ensure downside risk can be kept to a minimum in this play. Marathon Digital Technicals (Stockcharts.com) Marathon Digital's Profitability When it comes down to it, the best way to defend against a volatile Bitcoin price (and associated risk to the downside) is to improve the company's financial metrics. Although the company continued to burn cash at an elevated rate in fiscal 2022 (which resulted in more share dilution in Q4), management had to deal with fiscal 2022 headwinds such as Hardin 's associated costs, Compute North 's liquidation plus the well-publicized FTX (FTT-USD) crypto exchange bankruptcy. This led to Marathon's decision to shore up the balance sheet which makes sense for the following reason. For Marathon to execute on the potential it has, it needs to have sufficient solvency as well as ample liquidity irrespective of the losses it may need to continue to report over the near term. The company's objective of scaling the firm into a significant international Bitcoin miner is a real possibility given the size of the mining fleet and the rate at which the hash rate has been increasing. Suffice it to say, in an environment of growing energized miners alongside much-improved optimization, profitability should over time take care of itself. MARA Stock Valuation The problem though is that if profitability does not rebound and shares keep on trending higher. At present, for example, Marathon's forward price-to-sales ratio comes in at 3.36 which is based on almost 250% growth in the company's sales in this coming year (fiscal 2023). Despite the growth rate, Marathon's forward sales multiple still comes in roughly 30% higher than what the sector's sales are trading at (2.59). A few trends investors need to watch out for here: Marathon's fiscal top-line sales target of roughly $407 million has lost approximately 6% over the past thirty days as we can see below. Remember, Marathon Digital's share-price action is predicated on growing sales as the market (at present) expects this robust sales growth to convert to strong profit growth over time. Sales growth remains the principal driver of Marathon's valuation so long-term investors would do well in monitoring forward-looking sales expectations. Forward sales are expensive for a reason so if growth were to come to a grinding halt, the sales multiple, as well as the share price, would most likely fall as a result. Marathon Digital: Forward-Looking Sales Estimates (Seeking Alpha) Although top-line growth rates in Marathon easily surpass the industry, the company's gross margin of 38.2% still trails the sector by a significant margin (sector median of 50.17%). In an environment of rising costs, any significant uptick in this crucial profitability metric will essentially protect the income statement which is what the market wants to see. Enhanced efficiency & effectiveness is what management is looking for in fiscal 2023 so it will be interesting to see if better optimization can come to pass this year. Conclusion To sum up, despite the fact that Marathon Digital posted a sizable net loss in Q4 as well as in fiscal 2022, shares actually rallied on the news as investors opted to focus on what is coming down the track here. Bitcoin production increased significantly over the past two quarters and this trend is expected to accelerate throughout fiscal 2023. We will continue to monitor valuation & profitability trends closely. We look forward to continued coverage.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4588728-marathon-digital-growth-potential-outweigh-elevated-downside-risk?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/10905125.jpeg

Powers published in Belgium’s Official Gazette on Friday mean any mass-media campaign to promote a digital currency would have to be submitted to the Financial Services and Markets Authority (FSMA) 10 days in advance, allowing the regulator to intervene if needed.  “Virtual currencies are all the rage at the moment, but they involve considerable risk,” the FSMA said in a statement. “They are often subject to wild price fluctuations and are vulnerable to fraud and IT-related risks.”  The chance to make money quickly is cited as the leading reason why people trade in virtual currencies, and investors have been undeterred by the crypto winter or the collapse of crypto exchange FTX, according to an FSMA study.  The new rules, which will take effect on May 17, require ads to state that “the only guarantee in crypto is risk.” Belgium joins European countries such as Spain and the U.K. in imposing restrictions on publicity campaigns, which often mirror those already in place for traditional finance.

42414179,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAx7Tz,1679314695,"First Mover Americas: Bitcoin, as Safety Play, Climbs Past $28K","This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin climbed 4% in the past 24 hours to above $28,000 for the first time since last June as some traders see the cryptocurrency as a hedge against the traditional banking system, which has had its share of troubles over the past few weeks, including the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and regulators' takeover of Signature Bank. On Sunday, the Federal Reserve announced it had joined with other major central banks to ensure a steady flow of the U.S. dollar, a dominant reserve currency, in the global financial system. Bitcoin was up 25% this month through Sunday.  Non-crypto-related deposits held by former Signature Bank (now Signature Bridge Bank) will be assumed by Flagstar Bank, a subsidiary of New York Community Bancorp, as of Monday under a purchase and assumption agreement, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said in a press release on Sunday. Signature Bridge Bank depositors – other than depositors related to the digital banking business – will automatically become depositors of Flagstar, and will continue to be insured by the FDIC up to the insurance limit. Flagstar Bank's bid didn't include $4 billion of deposits related to the former Signature Bank's digital banking business.  The dollar value locked in the number of open bitcoin futures contracts is rising, signifying increased speculative interest in the market and potential for price volatility. Data from Coinglass shows the nominal value of open interest has reached a yearly high of $12 billion, marking a 7% gain for the month. An increase in open interest means new money is flowing into the market but doesn't reveal much about whether traders are getting in position for price gains or losses. In bitcoin's case, the new money seems to be betting on price gains, considering the funding rate or the cost of holding bullish long/bearish short positions has flipped into the green after spending most of the early parts of the Asian trading day in the red.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows bitcoin's rolling 30-day correlation with the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback's exchange rate against major fiat currencies.  The negative correlation has recently weakened amid U.S. bank failures that have complicated the Federal Reserve's fight against inflation.

42414209,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAx6y9,1679314504,Cryptocurrency Market Set for More Upside After Bank Problems: Bernstein,"Financial markets have been shaken in the past week following a series of bank collapses, providing a perfect setting for the decentralized-financial system to stand out as an alternative and for a continued advance in cryptocurrency markets, Bernstein said in a research report Saturday.  First Republic Bank’s (FRC) deposit rescue package by multiple institutions should make it obvious that this is a “generic banking problem” and crypto isn't to blame, the report said, noting that initial reactions to the collapse of of Silvergate Bank, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank were that those banks held deposits from the crypto world and therefore their problems were idiosyncratic.  “This is the perfect setting for bitcoin, ethereum and the rest of the decentralized-financial system to stand out as an alternative system, delinked from the traditional centralized banking system,” analysts Gautam Chhugani and Manas Agrawal wrote.  Bernstein says institutional funds and crypto funds have been bystanders in the market, with “crypto native money” behind the recent price moves. As more outside money is forced to participate, the moves higher should become sharper.  The banking on-ramp to crypto may be weaker in the U.S, but continues to be stable internationally, with access through over-the-counter hubs in Asia and Europe, the note said. OTC trading is done directly between two parties without the supervision of an exchange.  OTC hubs in the U.S. also seem to be working without interruption, the note added.

The Federal Reserve’s policy of raising rates has led to falling prices of Treasurys, which lowered the value of banks’ portfolios. The ensuing collapse of Silvergate Bank, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank (SBNY) has created panic in financial markets and sent banking stocks tumbling in global markets.  The technology behind open blockchains and transparent smart contracts stands in “stark contrast to the poor risk management practices that led to the turmoil witnessed in the U.S. banking sector this week,” the report said.  This supports the argument in favor of digital assets as an alternative and as a viable solution to the “points of failure witnessed in the existing financial system,” the report added.  In the near term, crypto businesses may find the operating environment more challenging due to the loss of some fiat payment rails, the note added.

The law’s political outlines were made final last June, but there have been multiple delays in definitively agreeing on a legal text, which must be translated into the EU’s 24 official languages.  Under normal Parliament procedures the final vote on MiCA will take place the following day, April 19.  The MiCA debate will be followed by discussions on another law known as the transfer- of- funds regulation, which controversially requires crypto providers to verify customers’ identity and which was also provisionally agreed back to in June.  Members of the Parliament’s Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee voted 28-1 in favor of the MiCA legislation in October, and national diplomats have also endorsed the plan.  The legislation offers crypto companies such as wallets and exchanges a license for operating across the bloc in exchange for meeting governance and consumer-protection norms, and also introduces reserve requirements for stablecoins. If approved, it will be published in the EU’s official journal and will take effect one to three years later.

42414177,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAx7Og,1679307151,"Crypto Market Witnesses Odd Relationship Between Bitcoin, Ether Volatility Metrics","For the first time in nearly two years, crypto options traders are implying that the largest cryptocurrency, bitcoin (BTC), will be more volatile than ether (ETH), the second-largest and the native token of the Ethereum blockchain.  That's unusual because ether and alternative cryptocurrencies generally tend to be more volatile than bitcoin. The trend is reflective of a market squarely focused on macroeconomic issues.  The spread between dominant crypto options exchange Deribit's forward-looking 30-day implied volatility index for ether (ETH DVOL) and bitcoin (BTC DVOL) fell below zero over the weekend, a phenomenon not seen since May 2021, according to data source Amberdata.  Implied volatility refers to the options market's expectations for price swings over a specific period. Options are derivatives contracts that offer the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date.  ""Bitcoin is in the spotlight again as cracks in [the] fractional reserve banking system cause distrust in fiat systems,"" said Jeff Anderson, chief investment officer at quantitative trading firm and liquidity provider Folkvang. ""Bitcoin dominance has ripped higher this month as the market scrambles for hard money and protection from impending fiat supply inflation.""  Several U.S. banks have gone bust this month, complicating the Federal Reserve's fight against inflation and boosting demand for bitcoin as a safe haven. The cryptocurrency has gained over 20% since the start of March, outperforming ether's 11% rise, CoinDesk data shows.  Bitcoin's dominance rate, or the share in the total crypto market, has increased to nearly 48% from 42%, according to data sourced from the charting platform TradingView. Meanwhile, ether's dominance rate has declined about 1 percentage point to 19% over the past week.  While bitcoin and ether are said to compete as non-sovereign assets, bitcoin has a history of benefiting from banking sector issues and has evolved as a macro asset over the past three years, receiving the most attention from institutions. Meanwhile, the market continues to see ether more as a proxy for overall developmental activity in digital assets than as a haven investment.  ""The negative spread is reflective of the two assets increasingly viewed as similar yet different proxies of risk, both markets are much deeper and liquid than the rest of the coins with established use cases,"" Patrick Chu, director of institutional sales and trading at over-the-counter crypto derivatives tech platform Paradigm, told CoinDesk.  Mean reversion ahead?  Implied volatility, or IV, is mean reverting, meaning that over time it tends to return to its lifetime average.  Sophisticated traders, therefore, buy options or volatility futures when the implied volatility is unusually low and sell options or volatility futures when it is exceptionally high. Implied volatility has a positive impact on options prices.  All this means the ETH-BTC IV spread could bounce back into the positive, boosting the value of ether options relative to bitcoin.

42414160,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAx675,1679306999,FTX’s Bahamas Arm a ‘Nullity’ That Should Be Stripped of Assets: Court Filings,"FTX wants to strip the company’s Bahamas arm from any claim over assets, saying it is a mere shell setup to further alleged fraud by founder Sam Bankman-Fried, FTX's new U.S. management said in a filing Sunday with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware.  The filing accuses Bahamas authorities of aiding Bankman-Fried’s attempts to escape justice, in a move likely to reawaken legal and diplomatic tensions.  The crypto exchange’s Bahamas arm, FTX Digital Markets (FTX DM), was placed into liquidation by the Bahamas courts on Nov. 10, and the wider corporate group filed for bankruptcy in Delaware on Nov. 11 – a confusing situation that led to disputes over who can access centrally held corporate data.  Sunday's filing by FTX, which is now under the leadership of restructuring expert John J. Ray III, seeks to have the U.S. Bankruptcy Court entirely strip Bahamas liquidators of their role by ruling FTX DM was an economic and legal “nullity” that doesn’t legitimately have any fiat, crypto or intellectual property to resolve.  FTX DM was “formed and functioned as an offshore haven for a continuous fraudulent scheme,” the filing reads, citing transfers of $143 million made to FTX DM bank accounts. Rather than being central to corporate operations, FTX DM was a short-lived match-making service that just started last May, the filing added.  “Mr. Bankman-Fried, and others at his direction, maintained a close, accommodating relationship with Bahamian law enforcement agencies” including the prime minister, attorney general and Securities Commission, the filing reads, adding that the FTX founder “aimed to leverage that relationship to minimize his criminal and civil exposure should the massive fraud be discovered.”  Bankman-Fried has pleaded not guilty to charges including wire fraud linked to his tenure as CEO at FTX. Other former executives have pleaded guilty to criminal charges.  Representatives of the Bahamas Securities Commission and Bahamas liquidators didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.  The Bahamas regulator has previously said Ray’s public comments demonstrate a “cavalier attitude to the truth,” but in January, Ray and the Bahamas liquidators reached a deal to cooperate on their parallel restructuring exercises.

Data from Coinglass shows the nominal value of open interest has reached a yearly high of $12 billion, marking a 7% gain for the month.  In the past month, bitcoin's price has rallied 15%, to $28,439 thanks to an increasing appetite for risk assets and a ""flight to quality"" within crypto.

Positive funding rates usually indicate a bullish trend because long positions compensate short positions; conversely, negative funding rates indicate bearish sentiment as short positions receive payment from those holding long positions.

42414168,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAx6cv,1679302236,"Bitcoin and Stablecoins Will Bring Crypto Mass Adoption to Africa, Experts Say","Many consider Africa the sleeping giant of crypto, and several speakers at last week’s Blockchain Africa Conference in Johannesburg, South Africa, picked bitcoin and stablecoins as the top two levers of crypto mass adoption on the continent.  The Central African Republic (CAR) adopted bitcoin as legal tender last year. Marius Reitz, general manager for Africa at crypto exchange Luno, said bitcoin adoption will likely accelerate over the next decade.  “I think in the future, in 10 years or so, you could start seeing a situation where neighboring countries also start to declare bitcoin as legal tender,” Reitz said. “Bitcoin could become a regional currency or it could even become a common currency across the African Union.”  Luno is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk's parent company.  Read more: Machankura’s Bitcoin Wallet Targets Africans With Old-School Phones and No Internet  Jonathan Ovadia, CEO and co-founder of South African crypto exchange Ovex, is slightly more bullish on stablecoins than bitcoin – despite three U.S. banks imploding just over a week ago, causing major stablecoins like Circle’s USDC to temporarily depeg as billions of dollars hung in limbo before federal regulators swooped in to “protect depositors.”  “Things like bitcoin are great, they’re permissionless, they’re free to transfer, but you can’t really store your entire net worth in them if you’re a minimum wage earner in Africa,” Ovadia said. “I think in general, stablecoins are probably one of the biggest innovations in the entire crypto ecosystem.”  Emphasis on the utility of stablecoins was a common theme at the conference. Hundreds of attendees from Africa and beyond showed up to hear more than 45 speakers discuss topics like “The Future of Stablecoins” and “The Adoption of Cryptocurrencies Across Africa” – panels on which Reitz and Ovadia participated.  Read more: Circle Scrambles to Right USDC After Signature Bank Failure  Maya Caddell, chief of staff at Web3 startup Nestcoin, said according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Africa’s population will double from its current 1.3 billion to 2.6 billion by 2050. Conversely, Western populations are on a steady decline.  “In two years time, one in six global Internet users will be African,” Caddell explained. “One in three youths globally – those between the ages of 15 and 35 – will be African by 2050.”  By the time 2050 (or some other future date) rolls around, several experts foresee a proliferation of stablecoins pegged to multiple fiat currencies or even hybrids of stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). These assets and the protocols governing them will likely run in the background with most users oblivious to their presence.  Crypto mass adoption wouldn’t be the first time Africa experienced a digital payments revolution. In 2007, a couple of Kenyan mobile network providers created M-Pesa, a service that provides payments, credit and savings with no bank account or Internet connection – just a basic old school feature phone.  Services like M-Pesa are called “mobile money,” and about a third of adults in sub-Saharan Africa now have a mobile money account.  But mobile money doesn’t have the global interoperability inherent to assets like stablecoins and bitcoin.  “You’ve got a lot of nuances in the African financial stack,” Caddell explained. “Not just between the West and Africa, but also between African markets.

42414172,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAx6nX,1679301207,EOS Network Ventures Commits $20M to Build Dapps and Games on EOS Blockchain,"EOS Network Ventures has committed $20 million in capital to develop applications and gaming products on the EOS network after April's Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) launch.  ""EOS Network Ventures (ENV) is making a formal commitment to invest $20M directly into $EOS EVM and GameFi projects,"" EOS Foundation CEO Yves La Rose tweeted early Monday. ""EOS EVM will also have the most funding available for builders,"" he opined.  ""With $20M up for grabs for EVM projects, we expect a massive influx of developers who want to take advantage of the funding opportunities,"" La Rose said, adding the commitment was made to attract developers and builders to the EOS blockchain in the coming months.  EOS is gearing up for its second innings with a funding push ahead of April's EVM launch. EVMs refer to the environment in which all Ethereum accounts and smart contracts live, serving as a virtual computer utilized by developers for creating decentralized applications (apps).  When deployed on other blockchains, EVMs can allow developers to build dapps and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications similar to how they would on Ethereum.  Such moves are thanks to the efforts of La Rose, who is leading plans for a consensus mechanism upgrade, an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) system and an overall renewed growth strategy.  EOS has long attracted criticism and scrutiny from market participants for raising $4 billion in its initial coin offering (ICO) with little to show in its early years in both technical and usage terms.  The renewed push could ultimately boost eos token prices in the coming months, as well as bolster the value locked on EOS-based decentralized applications.  Users are spoiled for choice in an increasingly competitive crypto market, however, as relatively newer networks such as Arbitrum, zkSync, Optimism and Solana, among several others, vie for developer talent and increase their own revenues via token incentives or airdrops.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | ARB | TOKEN SALE,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/03/20/eos-network-ventures-commits-20m-to-build-dapps-and-games-on-eos-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/07ce0772d0b3c71074ecf780cd270a56342adf3b-1900x1268.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Arbitrum developers confirmed last week that ARB will be airdropped to community members on Thursday, March 23, based on their prior network activity, marking Arbitrum’s official transition into a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).  This means ARB holders will be able to vote on key decisions governing Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova – networks that allow users to transact on the Ethereum blockchain with greater speeds and lower fees.  But call impatience to make money the vice for traders.  An I Owe You (IOU) token on the crypto exchange Hotbit trades at $9.74 in Asian afternoon hours on Monday. These tokens represent debt between two parties and settle instantly as trades are made.  The tokens have already seen over $2 million in trading volume in the past 24 hours, with trading data from Hotbit showing trades are being made every two minutes on average.  If that wasn’t enough, futures powerhouse BitMEX introduced its own ARB token futures product on Monday – offering leverage of up to 20 times to give traders a chance to make (or lose) even more money.  “Please note that our new ARB listing is a highly speculative contract (ARB doesn’t trade actively yet),” cautioned BitMEX in its listing announcement.  ARB futures prices on BitMEX are considerably lower than Hotbit’s, trading at just over $1 at writing time on Monday.  However, while these products are wholly speculative as of Monday, their use case might change after ARB tokens are officially issued to network participants.

42412596,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5R6y,1679291143,Taiwan’s Crypto Industry Welcomes Regulatory Announcement,"Taiwan will soon have special legislation to regulate cryptocurrency and its Financial Supervisory Commission will be in charge.  Huang Tien-mu confirmed this to lawmakers in Taiwan’s parliament during a hearing about global banking stability. Bloomberg initially reported the FSC was set to be announced as the regulator, citing sources in the legislature.  Wayne Huang, co-founder and CEO of XREX, welcomed the news, saying the industry can only grow when it's regulated.  “Our next steps would be for the virtual asset service provider industry to collaborate with the FSC to define regulatory operations,” he said, saying one of the first steps is to form an industry self-regulatory body to help develop a set of rules.  Reports say the FSC won’t be regulating non-fungible tokens (NFT). Local Taiwan media quote the FSC's Huang as saying that as NFTs are still emerging as an asset class, it's too early to regulate them.  “Due to the extendability and composability of NFTs, they can represent a broad spectrum of things ranging from commercial products to commodities to securities. Therefore the FSC likely needs more time to develop a proper set of NFT classification guidelines,” XREX's Huang adds.  Taiwan has two financial regulators: the Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan’s official name) and the FSC.  The Central Bank regulates monetary policy and foreign exchange regulations while the FSC has a broad remit over everything from banking regulation, securities and futures, to anti-money laundering.  “Getting the balance between experimentation and investor protection is the order of the day,” says Alex Liu, CEO of Maicoin.  Some in Taiwan’s parliament had called for the newly established Ministry of Digital Affairs (MODA) to be the chief crypto regulator, though others have said the Ministry is relatively inexperienced in regulation compared to the FSC.  “Militaries use guns and bullets. Let’s say they started using laser guns. Would you expect that to still fall under the defense ministry or a new department of directed energy weapons?” Liu remarked.  FTX pushed Taiwan to regulate  Historically, Taiwan has taken a hands-off approach to crypto regulation only regulating the asset class under the framework of controlling money laundering.  In September, authorities approved 24 crypto platforms under the island’s anti-money laundering compliance system.  However, the collapse of FTX added a sense of urgency to Taiwan’s regulatory push as the Taiwanese were one of the largest users of the exchange per capita, attracted by its relatively high-interest rates for U.S. dollar deposits compared to local banks.

42412607,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5RAi,1679279525,"Fed, ECB and Others Take Coordinated Steps to Boost Dollar Liquidity; Bitcoin Tops $28K","The U.S. Federal Reserve on Sunday announced it had joined hands with other major central banks to ensure a steady flow of the U.S. dollar, a dominant reserve currency, in the global financial system.  The Fed said it would increase the frequency of the dollar swap lines with the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of England, the Bank of Canada and the Swiss National Bank from weekly to daily, starting Monday. The dollar swap lines allow foreign central banks to borrow U.S. dollars while protecting the Fed from downside risks. In a swap, a foreign central bank swaps its own currency for an equivalent amount of U.S. dollars from the Fed at the market exchange rate. After a pre-determined time, the bank returns the dollars it borrowed, with interest, to the Fed.  The move is aimed at calming exchange rate volatility and avoiding strains in the supply of credit to households and businesses worldwide. It comes on the heels of blowups of three banks in the U.S. and the takeover of troubled Swiss-lender Credit Suisse by UBS and Swiss National Bank.     It shows heightened financial stability concerns among policymakers and questions the Fed's ability to continue hiking rates. The central bank has lifted the borrowing cost by 450 basis points since March 2022, roiling asset markets, including cryptocurrencies, last year.  More importantly, the Fed's backstopping of the global dollar liquidity reduces the risk of a worldwide dash for cash – investors selling everything, including bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and moving to cash, predominantly the U.S. dollar. During turmoil, investors typically sell risk assets and park money in cash, preferably the dollar. That drives up the cost of acquiring U.S. dollars, leading to stress in the financial system.  In other words, the increased frequency of swap lines has cleared the way for an unabated rise in risk assets, including bitcoin. The leading cryptocurrency by market value is largely seen as a hedge against the banking system and hit a nine-month high above $28,000 late Sunday, taking the cumulative month-to-date gains to nearly 25%, CoinDesk data show.  The dollar swap lines have been bearish for the dollar in the past. Bitcoin and risk assets, in general, tend to move in the opposite direction of the greenback.  The last global dash for cash observed during the coronavirus-led crash of March 2020 saw the dollar index surge above 100 and bitcoin nosedive by over 50%.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/03/20/fed-ecb-and-others-take-coordinated-steps-to-boost-dollar-liquidity-bitcoin-tops-28k,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/80a784283408015a5751aae169cd8c90e67044a1-3024x1701.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin is pushing past $28,000 but might face some resistance at $30,000.  Insights: What's driving the recent surge in bitcoin's price? Investors are looking for a safer bet in cryptos but liquidity remains an issue.  Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 1,205 +26.6 ▲ 2.3% Bitcoin (BTC) $28,006 +825.2 ▲ 3.0% Ethereum (ETH) $1,780 −2.8 ▼ 0.2% S&P 500  3,916.64 −43.6 ▼ 1.1% Gold  $1,980 +9.9 ▲ 0.5% Nikkei 225  27,333.79 +323.2 ▲ 1.2% BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices, as of 7 a.m. ET (11 a.m. UTC)  Bitcoin breaks free of its banking troubles  Good morning, Asia.  Bitcoin is continuing its tear as Asia begins its business day.  The world’s largest digital asset by market capitalization recently pushed past $28,000, gaining 3% in the last 24 hours.  Remember how the decline of crypto-friendly banks was supposed to smother crypto?  That narrative didn’t last long. Turns out that after the first chapter of the book, where Silvergate and Signature die, there’s a systematic crisis of confidence in the global financial system, which has rekindled an appetite for risk assets as traditional finance (TradFi) liquidity dries up – despite shaky fiat pipelines.  In Asia, things are slightly different.  David Bachelier, Asia-Pacific CEO of Flowdesk, points out that Singapore and the rest of Asia weren't really affected by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and the rest of the U.S. banking crisis, but it remains uncertain if banks are going to step in and try and fill the gap.  “SVB was a key player in providing funding and other services to high-growth companies that many Asian banks do not offer,” he told CoinDesk in a note. “This presents a critical moment for the venture industry in Asia, with an opportunity to fill the gap left by the collapse of American players.""  Bachelier said that while there might not be an Asian SVB anytime soon, one thing these banks are doing is stepping up and providing fiat pipelines for crypto.  “The recent announcement from Coinbase highlighting banking partnerships in Singapore is also interesting to note as it highlights an American company expanding further into the Asian region, suggesting the comparatively minimal disruption in response to these banking crises,” he said.  The question is, though, how long will this rally last?  Joe DiPasquale, CEO of digital asset manager BitBull Capital, said bitcoin is preparing to test $30,000, but, fundamentally, support might not be there.  “From a technical aspect, the current price action is overheated and we could see a correction toward $25K in the near term. The major market mover will most likely be [the Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee meeting], in about [three] days, where the majority of the analysts believe we will see a 25 [basis point interest rate] hike at best,” DiPasquale told CoinDesk in via email.  So perhaps we won’t be hitting $1 million bitcoin by June.  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Bitcoin BTC +3.0% Currency XRP XRP +2.5% Currency Avalanche AVAX +1.8% Smart Contract Platform  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Gala GALA −3.0% Entertainment Polygon MATIC −2.4% Smart Contract Platform Cosmos ATOM −0.6% Smart Contract Platform  Insights  Crypto Investors' 'Flight to Quality'  In the days following the shutdown of Silvergate bank, the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and then Signature Bank, many concluded the only place crypto prices could go was down. But then the Fed intervened in the sector (just don’t call it a bailout) and bitcoin looks to be heading back toward the moon, starting the week just over $28,000, which puts it up 27% over the last week.  One might ask how this is possible when the market is still predicting interest rates are going to rise in March and later in May.  It is Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) for the win.  While some, like former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes, have called BTFP a larger stimulus measure for bitcoin than COVID-19-induced quantitative easing, reduced liquidity appears to be a knock-on effect.  Data from CryptoQuant would suggest that the market is as dry as it gets. Transfer volume, active addresses and transactions are all down by double digits.  Crypto research firm Kaiko has been concerned about the lack of liquidity in order books since February.  “This is a huge amount of buy pressure on the markets,” Kaiko Director of Research Clara Medalie said during a recent appearance on CoinDesk TV. “As the markets aren’t that liquid, any significant buying pressure is likely going to have a considerable impact on prices as a whole.”  The extent to which liquidity is a problem is up for debate, however.  BitMEX Acting CEO Stephan Lutz downplayed concerns in a recent interview with CoinDesk. “Bitcoin’s liquidity is still very solid and sound,” he said. “We haven't seen people reducing their trading volumes, just the other way around, which is probably due to the fact that many of our loyal and big customers are bitcoiners.”  In a recent report the exchange released Monday, BitMEX plays out a scenario where risk appetite recovers as the Fed pivots on inflation. But this was written before BTFP came into the picture.  “Even if you have another hike of interest rates, [BTFP] just floods the market with liquidity again,” he said. “Quantitative easing is back in a different disguise.”  While Lutz points out that it would still be difficult to sell a large quantity of bitcoin without moving the market, sophisticated market players don’t do this and have algorithms to calculate how to split up the order to close the deal without impacting price.  “If they really want to liquidate … it’s not an issue,” he said.  Lutz argues that bitcoin’s recent surge is a “flight to quality,” almost parallel to what you would see in traditional markets during a time of crisis.  “You see stablecoin angst. People are going out of stables and back into bitcoin,” Lutz said, highlighting that the most recent patterns of trades he’s seen involve creating synthetic U.S. dollar equivalent positions in derivatives markets via shorts.  The BitMex clientele – bitcoiners at heart – would rather go into altcoins instead of U.S. dollar stablecoins.  Liquidity doesn’t just refer to the ability of the market to absorb moves back and forth into bitcoin. It’s also about fiat-to-crypto pipes.  Lutz said BitMex wasn’t impacted by the recent U.S. tech and crypto banking crisis, largely because BitMex isn’t in the U.S. and it doesn’t offer fiat on-ramps.  But this was expected, really, as the exchange has always been disconnected from the fiat system – a strategy that has avoided the panic over liquidity some of its competitors were cursed with.
