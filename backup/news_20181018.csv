42402016,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3Fnj,1539896626,"Judge Orders Trading Firm, CEO to Pay $2.5 Million in Bitcoin Ponzi Case","The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has won a legal battle against a New York resident and his company for running a Ponzi scheme centered around bitcoin.  Between 2014 and early 2016, Gelfman Blueprint, Inc. (GBI) and its CEO Nicholas Gelfman ran a scheme wherein they successfully solicited $600,000 from 80 customers, claiming that customers would earn money through the company's proprietary trading algorithm.  Instead, client funds were used to repay previous clients, thereby perpetuating the scheme with the newly-accrued money. This was the first anti-fraud enforcement action that the CFTC brought related to bitcoin, according to statements.  On Thursday, a federal judge ruled in favor of the CFTC, ordering Gelfman and GBI to pay $2.5 million in penalties and restitution.  In a statement, CFTC director of enforcement James McDonald said that ""this case marks yet another victory for the [CFTC] in the virtual currency enforcement arena.""  He added:  ""As this string of cases shows, the CFTC is determined to identify bad actors in these virtual currency markets and hold them accountable. I'm grateful to the members of Enforcement's Virtual Currency Task Force for their tireless work on these matters.""  The court specifically ordered GBI to pay $555,000 and Gelfman to pay $492,000 in restitution to clients, as well as $1.85 million and $177,000 in penalties, respectively. The court also imposed permanent trading and registration bans on the two.  That being said, the CFTC noted in its release that the scheme's victims may not recover any of their lost funds as it is possible Gelfman and GBI will not have sufficient liquidity to pay the restitution or penalties.

42402027,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3Fwa,1539895834,World's Largest Crypto Exchange Binance Looks to Add New Stablecoins,"Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by adjusted volume, is actively looking to list more stablecoins in addition to the three it already supports, which include the recently beleaguered tether (USDT).  ""We hope to be able to list a few more stablecoins on our platform,"" chief financial officer Wei Zhou told CoinDesk Thursday.  But that does not mean the Hong Kong-based exchange is souring on USDT, which lost its parity with the U.S. dollar on Monday and has yet to fully recover, trading at $0.976 on Thursday.  ""As a whole, we believe things will even out. We will continue to support USDT,"" Wei said.  Indeed, Binance's interest in expanding its stablecoin options predates tether's breaking of the buck. The exchange added support for Paxos Standard (PAX) in late September, weeks before USDT lost parity, and TrueUSD (TUSD) back in May.  Currently, Wei said the Binance research team is evaluating almost all the other stablecoins on the market, such as the Gemini Dollar (GUSD) backed by the Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. All of these newer stablecoins also broke their one-to-one fiat peg this week during the frenzy, though unlike USDT, they rose above $1 rather than falling below it.  Speaking to Binance's recent expansion in Uganda to work with local institutions for fiat on-ramps, Wei added:  ""Rather than hold bitcoin, [institutions] actually prefer to hold more stablecoins, because the dollar is still the default currency in some of these countries. That's just one use case that we've seen that's different in this part of the world, versus other parts of the world.""  Part of that appeal for institutional players – especially if a heavily monitored asset like GUSD enters the mix – will involve analytics tools developed with the investigation software provider Chainalysis to help improve Binance's compliance procedures.  'Critical for our ecosystem'  To be sure, Binance still sees USDT as a linchpin of the crypto markets.  Regarding tether, Wei said:  ""We do believe this stablecoin, as an entity, is critical for our ecosystem right now because it offers an alternative for investors to park their assets in something they can relate to.""  Lately, however, many investors have been pulling out rather than parking assets in USDT, and Binance briefly suspended withdrawals of the stablecoin earlier this week when price fluctuations followed a trading spike.  Wei said the oscillation was sparked by ""rumors being spread untruthfully"" about Tether, the company that issues USDT and has close ties to crypto exchange Bitfinex, although he added that ""from our perspective, we believe the market is always right.""  According to CoinMarketCap, bitcoin-USDT pairings made up over 14 percent of Binance's global volume over the past 24 hours, in addition to 12 percent of traction from USDT pairings with other popular altcoins. (The exchange ranks No. 1 by 24-hour volume if one excludes no-fee markets and transaction mining, No. 3 if such trades are included.)  Yet some are skeptical about the prospects for the newer, regulator-oriented stablecoins to take up some or all of tether's slack.  Nic Carter, a co-founder of Coinmetrics.io and partner at Castle Island Ventures, argued that stablecoins are currently used by traders who lack fiat on-ramps for regulatory arbitrage or want to avoid capital controls.  ""I don't believe traders will adopt the regulated alternatives, like the Gemini Dollar, which has anti-money laundering built into it,"" Carter told CoinDesk, adding:  ""To me, those aren't even playing in the same sandbox.""

Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, Sujay Jaladi is departing the San Francisco-based firm, which is best known for its role in developing XRP, the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Jaladi is joining Harbor, a startup that provides a compliance platform for issuers of private securities housed as tokens on the blockchain.  The company's R-Token standard (the R stands for ""regulated"") is compatible with ethereum's popular ERC-20 token framework, and, according to Harbor's white paper, can be used to tokenize interests in real estate, limited partnerships, fine art and other assets areas.  Harbor raised $28 million in April in a strategic funding round led by Founders Fund with participation by Andreessen Horowitz and Pantera Capital.  ""Ripple is a great company with a bright future,"" Jaladi said when asked why he's leaving the company. ""I am really excited about this opportunity with Harbor and think I can have a big impact on the company's success and help accelerate many of its key initiatives.""  Jaladi joined Ripple in May 2017, according to his LinkedIn page. He declined to say who would take over his role at the firm. Ripple's director of corporate communications didn't say who Jaladi's replacement would be, but remarked: ""We have a strong security team led by [SVP of engineering Christopher] Kanaan, just as it's always been.""  Describing his new role to CoinDesk, Jaladi explained:  ""I am responsible for the overall security strategy and program. This includes establishing processes and procedures across the company and the platform to ensure the protection of customer data.""  The role is similar to the one he held at Ripple, he explained, ""in the sense that the responsibility is to build a comprehensive security program that protects the company and its customers from threats, as well as to ensure compliance with all appropriate regulations.""  He added: ""Harbor is in a highly regulated space, which makes the role even more critical.""  In a statement, Harbor's CTO and co-founder Bob Remeika remarked that ""Sujay has the perfect blend of fintech and blockchain experience to accelerate our efforts to build a trusted platform for issuers, investors and regulators.""

Announced Thursday, the Strategic Hub for Innovation and Financial Technology (FinHub) will act as a central point for the securities regulator to interact with entrepreneurs and developers in the financial technology world, in particular with groups focusing on distributed ledger technology (DLT), automated investment advice, digital marketplace financing and artificial intelligence.

FinHub will be run by the SEC's senior advisor for digital assets and innovation, Valerie Szczepanik, and be staffed by SEC officials who have previously worked on fintech-related issues, according to the agency.  Szczepanik, who is also the associate director in the SEC's Division of Corporation Finance, said in a statement:  ""SEC staff across the agency have been engaged for some time in efforts to understand emerging technologies, communicate the agency's stance on new issues, and facilitate beneficial innovations in the securities industry.""

42402028,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3FyY,1539882019,Crypto Exchange Coinbase Open-Sources Its Security Scaling Tool,"U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase is making a recently developed automated security scaling tool available to the public.  Called Salus, after the Roman the goddess of safety and well-being, the program can automatically choose to run and configure different security scanners and issue a report on the results, according to a Thursday blog post from Coinbase developer Julian Borrey.  Available as an open-source tool on GitHub from today, Salus is said to offer the advantage of being able to centrally coordinate security scans across a large number of software storage repositories, avoiding having to configure a scanner for each different project.  It also means that, when making system wide changes to security scanner setups, updates can be made centrally within Salus to roll out across all repositories, the post states.  Coinbase explains that it uses a combination of human code reviews and automated scans to ensure its production deployments are as ""secure as possible."" Salus was recently built by Coinbase to fill a gap in what was available for the team.  The post further states that open-source software is often coded to contain security scanners which can ""tremendously improve security,"" adding:  ""Tools like these help us to ship faster, and we are tremendously grateful for these open source efforts. It was in this spirit that Coinbase started its open source fund, a token of gratitude for this type of community-oriented work.""  Coinbase now utilizes the tool to coordinate security scans across all its deployed services.  ""It helps us enforce security policies for each change made to a codebase and ensures there is a quick feedback loop with the developer about potential vulnerabilities,"" Borrey wrote.

Gox must submit claims for trapped funds by Oct. 22.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, the exchange first opened up the claims process in August, following a protracted bankruptcy battle.  In June, petitioners asking for their bitcoin back won a major victory, as the Japanese bankruptcy court overseeing the proceedings shifted the case to one of civil rehabilitation, meaning creditors could file for their cryptocurrency holdings, rather than a fiat equivalent based on cryptocurrency prices in 2014.  Bitcoin was worth less than $600 at the time the exchange declared bankruptcy, but subsequently soared to around $20,000 in December 2017 and is around $6,500 at press time, according to CoinDesk data.  After the October deadline passes, as set out in late June, Mt. Gox trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi will have a further three months to file a statement of approval or rejection.  While creditors can file for bitcoin claims, they cannot yet claim proceeds from any of the bitcoin forks that occurred since the funds were first frozen in 2014.

The news comes via a tweet from Miller Abel, the foundation's deputy director and principal technologist, on Oct. 17. Abel indicated that the organization and Coil will work together to implement the Interledger Protocol and explore ways to support ""pro-poor payment systems.""  Interledger is an interoperability protocol that allows payments across different crypto networks. The technology was initially co-developed by former Ripple CTO Stefan Thomas while he was still with the distributed ledger payments firm. The same tech now being used as the basis of Coil, which Thomas founded earlier this year, as CoinDesk reported.  While further details on the new partnership are thus far sparse, Abel also mentioned Ripple in his tweets yesterday.  The Gates Foundation announced its partnership with Ripple in October last year, when the two released an open-source software called Mojaloop – also focused on payment services to the poor and unbanked.  Yesterday's development appears to indicate that the Gates Foundation will work with Coil alongside Ripple to further develop the Mojaloop platform, which uses Interledger technology and connects the different parties in the payment system to facilitate real-time transactions.  According to a press release published last year, Mojaloop is an ""open-source software for creating payment platforms that will help unbanked people around the world access digital financial services.""  Abel tweeted yesterday that Mojaloop ""payments are in national currency of the given country, so that the system helps include and integrate the people (usually poor) who have historically been left out.""  The Gates Foundation has been exploring blockchain technology applications since as early as 2015 as part of its effort to improve financial inclusion.

Announcing the move in a press release on Oct. 16, the firm said, with the rising popularity of cryptocurrencies, it developed the new service to offer ""high-security offline storage that helps to protect assets from criminals and hackers.""  The crypto sector has seen huge losses related to hacks this year alone. According to a recent report from blockchain security firm CipherTrace, nearly $1 billion was stolen in the first nine months of 2018, as CoinDesk reported last week.  With the new service, G4S said it aims to address and reduce these risks, arguing that online wallets are vulnerable to thefts because ""they are only as secure as your computers are from hackers.""  Dominic MacIver, a senior risk analyst at G4S, said:  ""Our security solution is built on a foundation of 'vault storage'. We not only take the assets offline, but break them up into fragments that are independently without value and store them securely in our high security vaults, out of reach of cyber criminals and armed robbers alike.""  With institutional investors increasingly eyeing the crypto sector, the growing demand for more secure digital asset storage has seen a spate of traditional financial companies and cryptocurrency startups launching custody services in recent months.  Last week, U.S. financial services giant Fidelity Investments announced its launch of cryptocurrency custody and trading services for enterprise clients. While, in August, Goldman Sachs was reportedly considering a similar move.  Additionally, crypto security startup BitGo received approval in the U.S. to act as a qualified custodian for digital assets last month.

42402008,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3E7R,1539861320,Bitcoin Price Eyes Triangle Breakout Above $6.4K,"Bitcoin (BTC) is again trading in a narrowing price range above $6,400, but the lateral trading may soon give way to a rally, according to technical studies.  The price consolidation comes after Monday's big spike to three-week highs above $6,800, which weakened the bearish case put forward by last Thursday's violation of key support.  So far, however, a bullish follow-through has not materialized, possibly because buyers are waiting for a more credible evidence of bearish invalidation.  Also standing in the way of a potential rally are a number of major key resistance levels, as discussed yesterday.  Should BTC clear these key obstacles, then traders may feel convinced that the cryptocurrency has bottomed out again at the 21-month EMA support and could push prices higher toward long-term falling trendline resistance above $7,000.  The above scenario could play out if the three-day long narrowing price range (triangle pattern) is breached on the higher side. Interestingly, the moving averages on the short duration charts are aligned for a potential break above the triangle resistance.  At press time, BTC is trading largely unchanged on the day at $6,440 on Coinbase.  Hourly chart  The 50-, 100- and 200-hour exponential moving averages (EMAs) are trending north, indicating a bullish setup. Further, the stacking order of the 50-hour EMA above the 100-hour EMA, above the 200-hour EMA is a classic bullish signal.  As a result, BTC is more likely to cut through the upper edge of the triangle, currently at $6,460.  Another sign of a possible building directional change comes from the choppiness index, which has dipped below the 38.2 percent level.  So, it seems safe to say that triangle breakout, if confirmed, could yield a sharp move higher, possibly toward $6,800.  Daily Chart  Over on the daily chart, BTC has cleared the trendline falling from July highs and the 5-day and 10-day EMAs are beginning to rise in favor of the bulls.  Thus, prospects of a triangle breakout are high.  View  A triangle breakout looks likely and if confirmed, would signal a continuation of the rally from the Oct. 15 low of $6,151 and open the doors to $6,800.  A downside break of the triangle would shift risk in favor of a re-test of the 21-month EMA of $6,123.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

42401990,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3Dsg,1539859852,Asian Development Bank Paper Touts Blockchain in Government Procurement,"A new paper authored by World Bank Group-linked experts proposes development of a blockchain network to boost efficiency across government procurement systems worldwide.  Authored by Dr. Ramanathan Somasundaram and S. M. Quamrul Hasan, both researchers specializing in government procurement, the consultation report was published Thursday, touting blockchain tech in a technological proposal for the Asian Development Bank.  Currently, there are between 200 and 250 different e-government procurement (e-GP) systems installed around the world, the authors say. While these systems have potential to enhance government transparency, the siloed nature of the systems hinders their further advancement.  Providing detailed technical explanations, the authors propose the development of a blockchain system which can be deployed across worldwide governments' systems, with each participating as network nodes to access supplier databases in different jurisdictions.  The paper argues that this method can potentially eliminate current problems, including vendors having to file multiple times for entry on different procurement databases, and as a benefit would give each government real-time visibility of a vendor's actual workload.  The authors write:  ""Often, a bidder which is already overloaded with contracts pending completion is awarded additional contracts primarily due to lack of knowledge about the pending work-in-hand.""  Additionally, building a distributed network across governments and supporting banks could ensure that the procure-to-pay (P2P) cycle is automated and completed digitally.  ""The e-GP Blockchain network should be extended to enable Banks located anywhere in the world to seamlessly submit authenticated Electronic Performance Bank Guarantees on behalf of a Supplier in any of the networked e-GP systems,"" the authors go on to say.  While the paper was published as a technical proposal, it indicates interest from the Asian Development Bank in exploring the use of blockchain technology to improve government operations, especially in the Asian economies.  The paper's authors suggest that a realistic step forward would be to prepare well-defined funding requirements for the proposed network and to select at least ""three neighboring countries with active international bidder participation"" to participate in a pilot test.  ""As the system stabilizes, more e-GP systems can be on-boarded into the network in a phased manner,"" they conclude.

42401989,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3Dqi,1539850545,Japanese Government Working to Simplify Cryptocurrency Tax Filings,"Japan's Tax Commission is looking for ways to simplify the current tax filing system for cryptocurrencies in order to ensure investors accurately report their gains.  The commission, which guides policy on taxation and also advises the prime minister, held a general assembly meeting on Oct. 17 to discuss potential improvements to the process, according to regional news outlet Sankei.  The committee is reportedly planning a new system that would standardized the tax filing process and make it easier for taxpayers to calculate their profits on the sales of digital assets against both fiat currencies and other cryptocurrencies.  Currently, calculating crypto profits can be cumbersome, the report said, adding that the price for a cryptocurrency on different exchanges can vary, while the way different platforms store their historical transaction data is also not standardized. As such, taxpayers may find it difficult to submit a proper tax filing.  ""Since it is necessary to take into consideration frameworks other than the taxation system and business practices, we will hold a small meeting of experts to deepen the discussion while listening to outside opinions,"" Minoru Nakazato, president of the Tax Committee, was quoted as saying.  Currently, profits from the sale of cryptocurrencies in Japan fall under ""miscellaneous income."" A sliding tax rate from 15 to 55 percent is applied, depending on the actual amount of gains above a threshold of 200,000 yen per year, or about $1,800.  As CoinDesk reported in June, lawmakers in Japan raised the issue of changing crypto taxation from its current classification to that of ""separate declared taxation,"" although Japan's deputy prime minister pushed back that suggestion at the time.

42402005,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3E4U,1539846043,How a Bitcoin Exchange Is Surviving the Central Bank Crackdown in India,"Indian regulators' clampdown on cryptocurrency businesses is forcing the exchange startup Unocoin to experiment with stablecoins and ATMs to continue receiving fiat deposits from customers.  Unocoin co-founder Sunny Ray told CoinDesk his company hasn't been able to transact through regular banking channels with its 1.3 million customers for several months, after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) banned banks from working with crypto or crypto companies in April.  Most recently, Unocoin set up an ATM in a Bangalore mall where customers can deposit rupees to their exchange accounts without a bank or credit card. In the coming weeks, Unocoin will open a few more ATMs in Mumbai and Delhi.  ""We're essentially employing bank-grade ATM machines,"" Ray said.  Also, some users are quickly transferring their rupees to the ethereum-based TrueUSD token, which Unocoin began supporting in August, then using it to purchase bitcoin or other assets down the line when the price feels right. As a so-called stablecoin, TrueUSD is designed to maintain parity with the U.S. dollar.  For customers outside Bangalore, support for stablecoins may provide an indirect way to add or hold value in their Unocoin accounts without quite as much volatility, albeit it falls short of a fiat on-ramp. However, that transaction volume is still less than a few thousand TUSD per day.  ""We never even considered that [stablecoins] before,"" Ray said. ""That's more just like a stop-gap solution. It's not like an actual, final solution to everything.""  As Unocoin investigates how to scale compliant ATMs, Ray said the team is also looking to expand to Malta and Canada, in case operating in India becomes impossible altogether, all while exploring the options for listing several new stablecoins.  Stepping back, an ongoing legal battle to overturn or alter this ban hasn't yielded any results to date. Meanwhile, the ban is having a disastrous impact on India's crypto community, with the popular exchange startup Zebpay abruptly shutting down late last month.  As Kashif Raza, a co-founder of Crypto Kanoon, an Indian regulatory news startup, told CoinDesk:  ""The crypto community is suffering from this ban as there have been instances where the bank accounts of individuals have been closed who were found to be dealing in cryptocurrencies.""  The crackdown has been so severe that Raza said it has created a misconception in India that bitcoin itself is outlawed, even though the ban only applies to entities governed by RBI.  ""From a regulatory perspective there hasn't been any real clarity,"" Ray said. ""We as a company are working on a couple of solutions.""  Silver lining  None of this should imply that Indian crypto startups are now operating in a black market. To the contrary, Raza said exchange accounts can sometimes require more know-your-customer (KYC) paperwork than opening a new Indian bank account. Many see the ban as an inconvenient pause, not a death knell.  ""Given the fact that the Indian government seems to be in favor of the technology behind virtual currencies, the crypto community is quite hopeful that [banking crypto companies] will be regulated in future,"" Raza said.  Plus, Unocoin's ATMs allow for regulation-conscious investors like Karthik Reddy of Blume Ventures, who praised the new ATMs in a press statement, to keep detailed records of their crypto portfolios while still depositing fiat currency as needed.  On the other hand, the ban has certainly invigorated peer-to-peer trading. Indeed, the P2P exchange WazirX reached a new daily trading volume peak of 50 BTC in September 2018. At the same time, the global P2P exchange LocalBitcoins reached nearly $1.5 million in weekly Indian trading volume at least three times since August.  And there's even silver lining for Unocoin, which has seen up to 500 new account registrations every day ever since Zebpay closed its doors.  ""It's almost kind of freeing in a way because there are a lot of people in India that don't have online banking,"" Ray said. ""Almost everybody in India uses cash, so it might in an odd way open us up to an even bigger market.""  Still, speaking to how restricting crypto companies that seek to serve a country of 1.3 billion could affect global adoption, Ray concluded:  ""Innovation is being squashed in a country where one in seven people live.""

Scheduled to start on Nov. 5, the auction requires would-be bidders to deposit $200,000 after registering their identification with the agency no later than Oct .31.

42401999,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3E0Y,1539828269,New BitConnect Lawsuit Combines Previous Efforts Against Crypto Scam,"Half a dozen lawsuits against the allegedly fraudulent cryptocurrency scheme BitConnect have now been combined into a single legal effort.  According to court documents filed last Thursday, a new Amended Consolidated Class Action Complaint has been initiated in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. The new class action – coming months following its shutdown and the subequence collapse of the BCC token's price – consolidates all of the lawsuits previously filed against BitConnect, attorney David Silver of the Silver Miller law firm told CoinDesk.  He said via email that Silver Miller has been named the ""Class Counsel"" in the new suit which, in addition to consolidating the previous ones, also names additional BitConnect owners and promoters who were previously not part of any lawsuits.  ""As more information has become available, we have learned about more individuals involved in the rampant fraud associated with BitConnect,"" he explained, adding:  ""The Amended Consolidated Class Action Complaint highlights those actors who participated in the creation of BitConnect and the promoters of BitConnect. The amount of fraud, and the amount of investment loss in such a short period of time is staggering. We hope to move the lawsuit along as fast as possible and hold as many people accountable both in the United States and abroad.""  Background  The lawsuit cites no less than 22 different legal violations, as well as provides an exhaustive overview of what BitConnect was and outlines its history.  BitConnect shut down its crypto-lending platform in January following the issuance of cease-and-desist orders from Texas and North Carolina securities regulators, which claimed the company was engaging in an unregistered securities sale through its initial coin offering.  BitConnect's BCC token tanked as a result, falling from more than $400 to less than $20 in the first weeks of 2018.  The sudden loss of value led to a plethora of lawsuits seeking restitution for investors who saw their holdings evaporate, citing fraud and securities sale laws.  While these suits were filed through the first half of 2018, various consolidations have led to the most recent one filed last week. It names BitcConnect Public Limited, BitConnect International PLC, BitConnect Ltd, BitConnect Trading Ltd, as well as nearly 40 individuals affiliated with the project, including BitConnect India head Divyesh Darji and promoter Trevon James.  Included in the list of defendants in the most recent amended consolidated class action is YouTube, which was sued in July for allowing BitConnect promoters to publish more than 70,000 hours of content.  The consolidated lawsuit calls for a jury trial and seeks rescission of the investments made by the plaintiffs. It also looks for compensatory damages for the plaintiffs.  Silver concluded that ""the ideal outcome is that all of the money is returned to the investors in BitConnect.""

42401987,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3Dpj,1539822912,'Voldemort' Strikes Again? A New Crypto White Paper Has His Name On It,"A new privacy paper surfaced in the ""bitcoin wizards"" chat channel Wednesday bearing a familiar name – ""Tom Elvis Jedusor,"" the French version of Tom Riddle (better-known as Harry Potter's archenemy Lord Voldemort).  Strange as it sounds, this isn't the first time this happened. A little more than two years ago, a protocol improving two of blockchain's biggest problems, privacy and scalability, aptly titled ""MimbleWimble,"" was released by a cryptographer going by the pseudonym.  Even ever-fickle active bitcoin developers agreed it was a good proposal, one that would go on to spark a flurry of innovation and activity. Blockchain projects Grin and Beam are now putting its ambitious mathematical ideas to the test, hoping to finish a working blockchain that puts its ideas into practice for the first time soon.  This new paper, called ""Fragmented Transaction Protocol,"" promises a second privacy boost, aiming to ""obfuscate transaction amounts until the moment the coin is spent."" As such, the community is quietly hoping the author is the same person about to inspire developers once again, this time with a focus on privacy.  So far, there's some evidence in favor. For one, the new Voldemort did everything the old Voldemort did: Just a couple hours ago, they released the paper and called the ""bitcoin-wizards"" chat channel on IRC. It was originally released as an ""onion"" address, preserving the anonymity of the author.  But these might just be superficial similarities.  Mathematician and developer Andrew Poelstra, who was the first to go public with a positive assessment of MimbleWimble, voiced doubts about whether this new paper is by the same author. In fact, his first reaction is that it's not a very good proposal as it ""breaks"" some of the privacy aspects of MimbleWimble.  As such, he thinks it probably is not by the pseudonymous cryptographer who wrote MimbleWimble.  ""This has a very different writing style from the original Tom Jedusor paper, and has very broken incentives obviated by [confidential transactions] (CT). It would have much worse privacy than CT even if it did work,"" he said, responding to the released of the paper in the chat channel.  If Poelstra's initial reaction is correct, the new Voldemort is may be just be another developer who wanted to draw more attention to his proposal. For now, however, the true identity of the paper author (as well as its potential impact) remains to be seen.
