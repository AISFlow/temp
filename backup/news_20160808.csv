42399220,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbieuZ,1470695481,Isle of Man Tests Blockchain Prototype for IoT,"The government of the Isle of Man has announced its latest blockchain proof-of-concept.  Profiled today in Financial News, the project is a collaboration with blockchain startup Credits that finds the two partners exploring whether the technology can be used to help keep Internet of Things (IoT) devices from being compromised.  Credits co-founder Nick Williamson told the new source that the idea behind the project is to assign unique identities to physical items, thereby creating a way of affirming their authenticity.  Williamson told the publication:  ""The idea behind [the experiment] is that IoT has a promise of assigning a unique, non-forgeable identity to physical items and what the blockchain provides is the way of managing and maintaining an identity.""  An early proponent of the bitcoin and blockchain industry, the Isle of Man has long been one of the more active governments in exploring the technology.  The trial comes more than a year after the British dependency revealed it was working with Credits (then called Pythia) on a blockchain database for corporate registries, and nearly two years after it launched a digital currency-focused incubator.

42399217,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbieqd,1470691245,Questions Abound as Bitfinex Issues Digital Assets to Customers,"Bitfinex has issued its own digital asset in what analysts are labeling an unusual attempt to offset customer losses stemming from a $66m theft last week.  As the market eagerly awaited more details this weekend, Bitfinex announced and subsequently released a new blockchain asset called a BFX token to all customers. The offering, now visible in user accounts, is an attempt by the company to reimburse exchange users for the ""generalized loss"" of roughly 36% of their funds as an emergency measure to keep the exchange online.  Initially priced at $1 each, the BFX token is intended to be traded on an open market, and it might even eventually be swapped out for stock in iFinex, the exchange's Hong Kong-based parent company.  The exchange wrote this weekend:  ""The BFX tokens will remain outstanding until repaid in full by Bitfinex or exchanged for shares of iFinex Inc. The specific conditions associated with the exchange of these tokens will be explained in a later announcement.""  To analysts, the token is yet another step into uncharted territory for the troubled exchange that began last week with the plan to generalize losses across its user base.  On one hand, analysts agree the token is representative of what might happen should a business enter the liquidation phase of a bankruptcy. On other fronts, they were less sure of both how to view the token, and maybe more importantly, how it could be viewed by regulators.  The same, but different  Veteran digital currency lawyer Carol Van Cleef, for example, told CoinDesk she believes this is the first instance where a digital asset has been issued by a company to meet its debt obligations.  According to the terms, the BFX tokens are being deposited ""without release or waiver"" — which presumably means whether the customer wants them or not — into the account of each user. US customers may face additional restrictions, though exactly why was not clear from company materials.  Van Cleef added the idea isn't without its parallels in traditional finance.  ""It is apparent that they have attempted to develop a solution that is cognizant of various legal frameworks,"" she said.  However, she foresees that US government agencies such as the SEC and the CFTC could take an interest in the company's activities, but said that there’s nothing that inherently prevents Bitfinex from pegging its token to the US dollar or making it redeemable for stock.  Van Cleef said:  ""That kind of financial arrangement, while not commonly done using a token, is not unheard in other contexts.""  In lieu of insurance  Digital currency lawyer Drew Hinkes agreed that the BFX token is fundamentally different that anything he's ever seen before.  Further, he commented on the speed at which the decision to issue the asset was reached.  ""This concept of having an equity shortfall and issuing a token that then can be convertible into stock to my knowledge has never happened before,"" he said. ""Convertible debt into equity is not something you typically toss out there.""  Another difference is that while Bitfinex is branded as an exchange, many of its customers have opted to use the platform as a means to store their funds.  As Bitfinex uses a margin trading system based on peer-to-peer lending, there are advantages to doing so – namely the interest payments users can gain. But, Hinkes said the lack of insurance offered by the company made doing so especially risky.  Traditional banks are required to ensure deposits of up to $250,000 through the Federal Deposit Insurance Trust (FDIC), but this is not the same for digital currency exchanges.  Hinkes is concerned about what might happen if customers demand a full withdrawal of their deposit. In some ways, the BFX token appears to be based on the assumption that the customers will be more interested in recovering their funds over time without a fight than all at once through the potentially tedious process of a lawsuit.  ""The entire community should take a half step back and look at what’s happened,"" said Hinkes.  He continued:  ""A lot of people have been robbed and instead of their money, they're being offered a debt token.""  A pound of flesh  Jerry Brito, executive director of the non-profit research facility Coin Center, agrees with Hinkes that US agencies are likely to be paying close attention to the way Bitfinex is handling the theft.  Speaking with CoinDesk, Brito said he believed it is likely the US Federal Trade Commission that would be paying the closest attention.  Specifically, he's concerned about the Bitfinex terms of service. The documents have come under community scrutiny in recent days for revealing new details, such as Bitfinex's registration in the British Virgin Islands.  But Brito said that uncertainty about Bitfinex’s decision could result in action by more than just the private sector.  He concluded:  ""I would be surprised if there are not lawsuits that emerge from this incident, especially by customers who may want to contest the socialized loss scheme.""  Bitfinex did not respond to requests for additional information at press time.

42399233,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbif6N,1470683446,Payments Firm Qiwi Could Transition to Blockchain By 2021,"Russian payments firm Qiwi now estimates it could upgrade its core database to a distributed ledger system by 2021.  In an interview with Rambler News Service, a representative for the company said that this projection is in line with estimates that the full transition to any new technology takes about three years after a successful trial.  The statements, widely covered in Russian media, follow Qiwi's announcement of the trial in May.  At this time, Qiwi representatives told CoinDesk in detail why the company is building a private blockchain system as part of a bid to increase the transparency, accountability and efficiency of its services.  In the latest remarks, Qiwi CTO Alexey Arkhipov provided more detail about how the ultimate switch to the system could take place.  Arkhipov said an interim period would likely be needed to transition its older, centralized database out of use, though he added that the two systems could operate side by side for as long as a year to avoid issues.  Arkhipov told the news source:  ""A full transition to this technology, we could implement maximum by 2021.""

42399230,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbif1S,1470679241,The DAO Hacker is Getting Away,"What happened to The DAO hacker?  It's a question that weeks after the headline-grabbing heist rocked the blockchain world seems to evade an easy answer.  Interviews conducted by CoinDesk indicate the ethereum community seems to have largely abandoned efforts to find the individual or group that compromised the project, even as the ramifications of what was done to protect investors continue to reverberate.  To recap, The DAO attack proved the primary motivation in encouraging a majority of the ethereum community to agree to create a new blockchain history last month. The thinking was that ethereum users would quickly migrate to the new fork, leaving any coins on the original blockchain where The DAO hacker had a balance worthless.  This, however, is not what occurred.  Rather than abandon the old blockchain, development continues to be led by those ideologically opposed to the new blockchain and its values.  Two weeks later, the blockchain known as ethereum classic has a amassed a global market cap of almost $200m. The market has further decided its tokens, classic ethers (ETC), have value, enough for it to be the fifth largest digital currency in the world.  In addition to creating a new market for investors, the developments are a huge break for The DAO hacker.  Should these funds be successfully sold, The DAO could ultimately walk away with $8.5m. Though that's still a fraction of the nearly $40m he or she would have if his bounty was denominated in ETH, it's not a bad cache for one day's work.  What moves the tale beyond speculation, though, is that there is increasing evidence to suggest the hacker has noticed the appreciation of his new funds.  In recent days, that value has been on the move.  Exiting positions  There remain other open questions as well, such as how The DAO hacker will liquidate his or her position in ETC.  Due to the original construction of The DAO, there were rules on how funds could be withdrawn, and those have now been replicated in the alternative version of the accounts on ethereum classic. And so, as happened in ethereum prior to the hard fork, a 27-day countdown has once again begun before the 3.6m ETC can be taken out of the contract.  Nick Johnson, software engineer for the non-profit Ethereum Foundation (which has supported the hard-fork version of ethereum), was able to explain how the DAO hacker could profit by converting his classic ether funds into fiat currency or another digital currency.  Johnson explained that it's likely the attacker wasn't a curator of the fund, meaning he or she would need to create another DAO to withdraw those funds to before gaining custody.  But he added that he hadn't investigated the details of the matter.  Interviews with members of the Ethereum Foundation suggest stopping the DAO hacker from profiting from his heist, even through an alternative version of the blockchain, isn't top of mind.  ""Sorry to disappoint,"" he said. ""But I'm afraid I'm probably the wrong person to ask here.""  Plot thickens  The story gets more complex, though.  In the weeks preceding the hard fork, other measures were taken to try and gain control of The DAO hackers funds.  This included the formation of a group of so-called ""white hat"" hackers that sought to attack The DAO contract in a bid to return custody of the funds to their owners. At the time of the fork, multiple DAOs existed that contained stolen funds wrested from the hacker's control.  Due to the fact that this blockchain continues to operate, these accounts were also replicated.  Still remaining in those white hat accounts on the ETC blockchain are 7.2m ETC in one account and nearly 600,000 ETC in another account. Based on the ETC rate of $2.24 at the time of publication that makes those accounts collectively worth more than $17.6m.  It remains unclear how this value could be spent, who associated with that effort may attempt to liquidate this value and whether any proceeds would be used to compensate investors.  In conversation with CoinDesk, ethereum lead developer Fabian Vogelsteller and Ethereum Foundation UX designer Alex Van de Sande both said they didn’t know what might happen to those resources, adding that they have focused their attention on the new ethereum blockchain.  Neither said they knew who owns the private keys that could possibly grant access to the funds.  When it came to what might happen to the DAO account owned by the hacker, both Vogelsteller and Van de Sande agreed that the attacker will likely walk away with the funds.  ""I don’t know what will happen with the white hat DAOs,"" said Van de Sande, adding:  ""But yes, the Dark DAO attacker was able to get away with a big part of ether classic. That was the point of classic wasn’t it?""  The gatekeepers  The final barrier for the hacker then may be the major ethereum exchanges.  As the primary venues for the buying and selling of ETH and ETC, they remain the easiest option The DAO hacker has to obtain an exit, but one of the most problematic due to the KYC and AML rules they enforce.  Founder and CEO of Poloniex, Tristan D'Agosta, said the next step for the hacker would likely be to convert the ETC to BTC.  But when those funds ""do start really moving,"" he said, the attacker will have to work to evade detection – no small feat on a public blockchain, where the history of transactions can be freely explored.  As for how exactly any conversion might take place, D'Agosta offered some theories, but didn't want to go into too much detail so as not to accidentally give any ideas to the hacker.  ""He probably knows already, as he has shown himself to be very smart,"" D'Agosta said. ""But many attackers are brilliant in some ways and extraordinarily stupid in others.""  Kraken, the second-largest ethereum exchange by volume, has not responded to requests for comment on the matter.  Ending unknown  It remains to be seen what the hacker might do next, but theories are already percolating online.  Last week, additional movement in a DAO associated with the hacker became a topic of conversation on social media, indicating that the funds are another step closer to being withdrawn.  As for the ETC accounts that correspond to the white hat attacks, one source with knowledge of the situation said he has ""theories"" as to who owns the private keys, but he said that he and others weren't likely to share names.  Of all the involved parties and all the millions of dollars on the line, the person with perhaps the strongest stance against doing anything to stop the hacker from successfully withdrawing the funds is Arvicco, the 40-year-old developer who last month initiated the etherum classic project.  The pseudonymous head of ethereum classic said he has no idea what will happen with the Dark DAO on the ETC blockchain.  He concluded:  ""According to our philosophy, ethereum classic developers are focusing on the platform itself and do not meddle on [the] dapps/smart contract layer.""

42399229,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbif0T,1470674448,Bitcoin 'Hacker Residency' to Launch in New York,"A bitcoin development training program will launch in New York City this September to teach new developers the basics of the protocol.  While bitcoin might not be the easiest software to master today, bitcoin R&D group Chaincode Labs believes it can help mitigate this issue by giving developers an option to learn in an environment that is more supportive and interactive than current online materials can offer.  Set the firm's headquarters in New York, the four-week ""hacker residency"" program aims to give developers an opportunity to work on projects that pique their interest starting 12th September.  Notably, bitcoin developer and Blockstream co-founder Matt Corallo will take a leave of absence from his startup as part of a bid to support the effort.  Corallo told CoinDesk:  ""You always hear a lot of people that want to contribute to the protocol, but find it to be really daunting. The motivation behind it is giving back to some extent and to improve the number and quality of people contributing to low-level protocol development in bitcoin.""  Organizers said the final number of developers accepted will depend on the number of qualified applicants.  Learn from experience  As noted by Corallo, the program is in many ways an acknowledgement of the difficulties that the bitcoin ecosystem has had in onboarding new developers.  Corallo noted that a developer's ability to support the open-source project now depends on his or her comfort with ""in-depth incentive structures"" and other subject areas that may require a certain nuance.  ""It's certainly not a quick process. It can take quite a while to learn all of the implications of all the ins and outs,"" he said.  He mentioned that it took a couple of the current Bitcoin Core developers a year or so to contribute usefully, although they didn’t have the same one-on-one mentorship as offered by the residency.  But Corallo said that the mission is less about building a team of contributors and more about fostering a healthy learning experience.  ""It's not necessarily about getting people to provide the most useful contributions in a month,"" he said.  More details  As for what the program will entail, the organizers said the curriculum will consist of a series of talks on the bitcoin protocol but that it will be otherwise fairly loose.  Residency developers can investigate whatever interests them, meaning that any in a long list of projects that the Bitcoin Core development team has been working on can gain the benefit of extra contributors.  ""It's really about picking a project that gives you ample room to understand the space,"" Corallo said, adding:  ""Whatever people want to contribute to is fine, as long as it’s good for learning about bitcoin.""

The agency said in a statement todayhttps://www.usmarshals.gov/assets/2016/bitcoinauction/ that the bitcoins being sold are connected to a number of criminal and civil cases that have been pursued by the US government in recent years.  These include bitcoins from cases involving former federal agent Carl Force IV and convicted Silk Road administrator Ross Ulbricht, as well as bitcoins confiscated by the US Department of Homeland Security; the Bureau of Alcohol, Firearms and Tobacco; and the Internal Revenue Service.  The auction will consist of one block, with a $100,000 deposit required. The registration deadline is 18th August, and the auction will take place between 13:00 and 19:00 UTC on 22nd August.  Winners will be notified on that day, according to the USMS.  The auction is the first USMS sale of the digital currency to take place this year, and one of several conducted by the agency in the past two years. Many of the bitcoins previously auctioned were tied to the investigation into the Silk Road dark market.  Earlier this year, a tranche of roughly 24,500 BTC was auctioned off by Ernst & Young after it had been confiscated from a former Silk Road user.

42399228,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiezU,1470657062,Australia's Postal Service Tests Blockchain Identity,"Australia's state-owned postal service is now considering several blockchain applications.  According to a report by ZDNet, the company is looking at accreditation and e-voting as part of internal blockchain R&D efforts. The Australia Post first divulged details about its blockchain work in March, when CEO Ahmed Fahour discussed uses involving digital identity.  Rick Wingfield, a partner for the Australia Post Accelerator unit, told attendees of the Technology in Governance conference last week that he believes the technology could help the government streamline processes that involve ascertaining identity.  Wingfield said:  ""If we're going to successfully digitize the economy and the hard parts of the economy that haven't been digitized yet ... the hard things like health, education and government services, those things require trust. If we're going to digitize some of those things, then we need to know someone is who they say they are.""  That said, Wingfield remarked that there's concern about the potential to  ""take people's private information and put it on a public ledger"".  The comments follow efforts by the government of Australia to position itself as supportive of the technology, outlining in a policy statement earlier this year its intention to ease rules for FinTech companies and move to end the ""double taxation"" of bitcoin transactions in the country.
