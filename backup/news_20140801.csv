42397820,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEHla,1406932512,"All Things Alt: Starcraft Goes Crypto, Urocoin's Future and a Mining Pool Prohibition","Even as the calendar turns to August, there has been no shortage of exciting times in the altcoin world. While the news hasn’t been all good – several high-profile alt scams have rocked the community in recent weeks – there’s no denying that the community is still filled with enthusiasm.  To get just a taste of what’s been happening – and what’s to come – keep on reading!  Developer Bohan Huang on the future of uro  The urocoin project has attracted a fair amount of controversy, both regarding its developer and the alt’s long-term viability. Urocoin is a coin backed by the market value of urea, a type of fertilizer used commonly throughout the world.  In theory, the value of each urocoin is pegged to one metric ton of urea, which at market prices puts each coin at just over $300.  These days, however, URO is trading at just above $2 despite once hitting a high of $18.  Speculation and criticisms aside, it appears that the uro initiative is proceeding full-steam ahead, with discussions taking place that will establish a payment network for uro to be used by urea sellers and traders.  All Things Alt caught up with uro developer Bohan Huang, who discussed the future of the coin and what he hopes to accomplish with the project. Notably, Huang is aiming to create a marketplace - with uro as its foundation - that enables commodity merchants and traders to profit.  Huang explained:  “We think this separation of 'trading' and 'buying' is a good thing going forward for markets like urea, because the purchasers are agricultural mainly as opposed to financial so they do not really want to deal with all the headaches of fluctuating prices, whereas traders and speculators love volatility for profits. So it's a win-win.”  As for the future of URO-urea exchange, Huang said that the development team is working toward an agreement between urea producers and buyers to allow the usage of urocoin. Huang stated that, by consensus, parties within the system will agree to pay the set rate of 1 URO per 1 metric tonne of urea.  “In our case, it’s consensus to accept 12,500 uro as payment for a 12,500 metric tonne shipment of urea (smallest cargo ship volume),"" he said. ""So, as more customers use this payment option, demand and supply will slowly adjust the market exchange rate to the 'correct' level because the number of tokens is limited.”  The Uro Foundation, the trade organization overseeing efforts to integrate urocoin into the urea market, announced last month that the first-ever urea transaction involving 25,000 URO was conducted.  Given the volatility in the price of urocoin and lingering concerns among the alt community, it remains to be seen where this project will go in the months ahead.  Minerals community prepares for StarCraft II tournament  Previously on All Things Alt, we looked at several altcoins seeking to make inroads into the e-sports betting, a proposition that supporters of the concept see as a way for cryptocurrencies to gain broader adoption.  This weekend will see a critical event in this movement, as the minerals development team and a group of StarCraft II players are set to kick off the Immortals Minerals Invitational on 2nd August beginning at 10 am PDT.  Hosted by The Immortals, a globally ranked StarCraft II team, the event brings together six prominent players from the game’s international player set. These players will compete in a round robin while an open bracket with 128 slots. Registration is still open, according to the site.  Prizes are denominated in both US dollars and minerals, bringing the tournament in line with others that take place with thousand-dollar cash purses. The top prize in the event is worth 25,000 MIN, or roughly $250, with second and third place worth 10,000 MIN and 4,000 MIN, respectively.  As the website explains:  “This is an exciting Starcraft II event featuring six of the best players in the world and an open bracket to give 128 players a chance to play against their favorite pros. The tournament will be supported by a prize pool featuring a lucrative combination of both USD and Minerals cryptocurrency.”  The minerals betting platform, which has been undergoing an open beta for the past few weeks, will be available for MIN betting during the event.  Bitcoin Talk restricts mining pool posts  In an effort to cut down on pool-related spam, the moderator team for Bitcoin Talk forum has announced new restrictions on this type of posting.  As explained  by forum moderator BadBear, the prohibition extends to all parts of the website, although much of the criticism behind the banned practice – spamming threads with pool advertisements – is focused on altcoin project postings.  The moderator said:  “Advertising mining pools is no longer allowed, including, but not limited to, altcoin announcement threads. Mining pool OPs should make one thread within the Mining section of Alt Currencies. Do not make a separate thread for each coin. Most OPs already link to pools available so advertising your pool is unnecessary and leads to too much spam.”  The community response was mixed, ranging from enthusiasm for the ban to confusion and concern that new altcoins – and the pools that service them will be at a disadvantage. Pool operators themselves decried the move, saying that those unfamiliar with navigating Bitcoin Talk will have a hard time finding information on which pools service certain altcoins.  It should be noted that thread posters are not restricted from listing mining pools as options for users. Instead, the prohibition – which began on 31st July – focuses on pool owners who stand accused of spamming messages in a variety of threads.  Strange alt of the week  The anonymous coin movement has produced a variety of alt projects, including well-established alts like darkcoin and XC and newcomers such as cloakcoin and keycoin.  Yet a relatively recent entry into this increasingly crowded space brings several unusual characteristics to the table, as well as some downright bizarre branding.  Robotsexnickels (sign: RSN), which officially launched on 19th July, offers a 600-year-long mining schedule – yes, 600 years – and a month-to-month reward structure that fluctuates throughout the year.  According to the official Bitcoin Talk post:  ""Robotsexnickels is a secure anonymous cryptocurrency with a primary purpose of providing slick lubrication for frisky robot jiggy-jiggy. There is a 1% premine to cover bounties and web hosting costs. No humans.""  For its out-of-the-ordinary approach to the mining lifetime length, RSN has won this week’s Strange Alt of the Week award.  With an exact mining schedule of 603 years, the network will produce approximately 3.8 million robotsexnickels. According to the developer, “this roller-coaster shape is designed to discourage miners from dropping in and out short term and reward the smart bots who stick around.”  It’s unclear how long the coin will last with this kind of schedule, but in the words of one community member, the premine alone is worth six years of mining.  RSN is said to offer TOR implementation for anonymous transactions, and according to the developer, a “Robot Sex Nickel Slot Machine” is currently in development.

42397809,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEHdi,1406929517,Bitcoin Foundation Urges Court to Dismiss Charge in Florida LocalBitcoins Case,"The Bitcoin Foundation, the digital currency's chief trade organization, has filed an amicus brief in connection with a Florida state criminal case involving Pascal Reid, a LocalBitcoins.com user who was arrested and charged with operating an unauthorized money transmission business and money laundering earlier this year.  An amicus brief, known formally as an amicus curiae, is a legal tool that can be exercised by parties with strong interests in a case who want to ensure an outcome that is consistent with their views.  In this instance, members of the Bitcoin Foundation told CoinDesk, the intent of the filing is to ensure that the broader bitcoin community in Florida isn't subject to laws that put undue restrictions on their ability to transact with the digital currency.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Bitcoin Foundation Global Policy Counsel Jim Harper, stressed this viewpoint, saying that the filing does not mean the organization is supporting the defendant and his actions in the case directly.  Harper explained:  ""The case illustrates the need for clarity in bitcoin regulation, both civil and criminal, and that's a reason why we participated.""  Reid was arrested in February allegedly during an undercover sting operation in which Florida police officers posed as fraudsters seeking to launder cash by purchasing bitcoin.  Filing details  In particular, the amicus brief seeks to dismiss the charge that Reid was an unauthorized money transmitter under Florida Statute 560.125 because he was operating not as a corporate entity, but as an individual.  Harper told CoinDesk:  ""If individuals' bitcoin transactions made them subject to the registration and recordkeeping requirements of businesses, that would be a heavy impediment to bitcoin use. Whether the charges are serious or trivial, the law should be applied accurately and based on its terms.""  This viewpoint was further stressed by Brian Klein, of the Foundation's Legal Advocacy Committee, who wrote in a recent blog post:  ""The foundation’s position at its core is this: state prosecutors are improperly applying Florida statutes regulating 'money service businesses' to individuals conducting peer-to-peer sales of bitcoins.""  Notably, Michell Adbar Espinoza, a Miami Beach native, was also arrested during the sting and charged with illegal money transmission. However, a Bitcoin Foundation spokesperson said that the cases are separate and that only Reid has moved to dismiss the money transmission charge.  The two defendants were allegedly arrested after agreeing to convert $30,000 in laundered money into bitcoin. Espinoza is estimated to have completed more than 150 bitcoin sales via LocalBitcoins during the six months leading up to his arrest.  Both Espinoza and Reid filed to have the money laundering charges dismissed on the grounds that under IRS guidance, bitcoin is not legal money. A similar defense was evoked by the legal representation of Ross Ulbricht, the alleged ringleader behind online black market Silk Road, but the claim has since been struck down by a court judge.  Further arguments  The filing goes on to state the Foundation's belief that the statute does not apply to Reid because Florida's definition of a money transmitter is limited to ""a corporation, limited liability company, limited liability partnership or foreign entity qualified to do business in the state"".  Further, it advocates that until such time as Florida decides to regulate bitcoin, the state should not apply an ""ambiguous criminal statute"" and ""force its application when that application is uncertain at best"". Florida regulators have only thus far issued a consumer bitcoin warning, which was distributed to the public in March.  Harper suggested to CoinDesk that the Bitcoin Foundation may be likely to submit further filings in similar cases that could help define bitcoin laws globally, concluding:  ""Early cases are precedent-setters, and the foundation wants to see that the laws are applied well.""

42397817,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEHjc,1406925641,PropinaBitcoin Promotes Bitcoin in Latin America with Restaurant Tipping Service,"PropinaBitcoin, a new project that seeks to promote digital currency awareness in Latin America by encouraging the use of bitcoin for real-world tipping, has officially launched.  Described by developer Nubis Bruno as a grassroots initiative, PropinaBitcoin is a free online service that allows bitcoin users to print paper wallets that can then be left as tips at restaurants and bars. Those who receive the paper wallet then visit PropinaBitcoin's website where they are given detailed instructions on how to retrieve the funds.  Bruno, who also serves as the chief product officer for Latin America-focused bitcoin exchange Bitex.la, framed the service as an informal project aimed at connecting new bitcoin users to popular industry services. The site refers users to Bitex.la, peer-to-peer trading platform ConectaBitcoin, bitcoin-friendly merchant listings site CoinMap.org and bitcoin wallet provider Blockchain.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Bruno indicated that the strengths of the project are its design and community support. The look of the tipping vouchers notably mimics traditional bank notes so that recipients better recognize that the paper slips they've received have value.  Bruno explained:  ""The paper wallet design gets their attention and suggests value [...] I think people living on a fixed income in Argentine pesos have the most to gain from a currency like bitcoin, and giving out small amounts is a good incentive for them to inform themselves and learn about it.""  The project was originally proposed on the Bitcoin Argentina Facebook group, where it received widespread support, garnering nearly 70 comments as of press time. The software itself is a fork of Bitaddress.org, an open-source bitcoin wallet generator.  Currently, the website is available in Spanish only. The project was co-developed by Manuel Beaudroit.  Using PropinaBitcoin  Site users who want to print their own tickets can follow the prompts at the bottom of the website to begin using the program.  By clicking on the 'Print your own tickets' command, users have the option to create and print 12 unique tickets.  Users then send bitcoin to the QR code printed on the slips, stocking the paper wallets with the value they want to leave as a gratuity.  Bruno said that he believes the resulting offering will appeal to local restaurant workers, in part because of the industry's cash-friendly culture. He said tips are rarely paid with credit cards and that many businesses only accept cash.  The nature of the design also makes it secure for users, Bruno said, adding:  ""The paper wallets are generated in the user's browser so PropinaBitcoin does not even know about the bills being printed by others.""  Increasing awareness  Generating support from Argentina's enthusiastic bitcoin community will be a continued goal of the PropinaBitcoin project. One way it hopes to keep the conversation about the initiative going, for example, is through a dedicated Facebook page.  There, users are encouraged to post images of PropinaBitcoin tips that they leave in an effort to increase overall usership.      Post by Propinabitcoin.        With the feedback phase over, Bruno is now excited to put the idea into practice, in what he hopes could help further develop the bitcoin conversation in Latin America. He concluded:  ""We're giving out bitcoin tips anytime we can and we're receiving feedback from people leaving their own tips.""

42397804,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEHal,1406920552,BitLicense Bitcoins Will Trade at The Market Rate,"This week CoinDesk carried a piece by John Matonis, the executive director of the Bitcoin Foundation and a self-described cryptoeconomist, in which he suggested that “government tainted” bitcoins traded on licensed exchanges will trade at a discount, creating arbitrage gain opportunities for savvy traders.  Matonis’ argument  goes like this: consumers value privacy, which is why they adopt technologies like bitcoin. Since bitcoins that have passed through licensed exchanges will be inherently less private than bitcoins that haven’t, demand for them will be lower. The response by the market will be to lower the price of the tainted coins until they start to move. This can be interpreted as consumer demand for a discount due to the loss of privacy.  I respectfully disagree. New York bitcoins will trade at the market rate. In fact, I doubt that trading fees will even be higher for New York residents or that they will be blocked by the major exchanges. Any increase in overhead related to the BitLicense will be passed on to all customers or absorbed by licensees.  In spite of what they say, people don’t seem to value privacy very much, or at least not enough to actually pay for it. Most consumers are more than willing to hand over basically unlimited amounts of personal information, so long as it comes with access to something that they want or like using. Data vacuums like Google and Facebook remain as popular as ever.  I predict two things will occur in connection with New York’s BitLicense: first, when finalized, the BitLicense rules will be substantially similar to the proposal currently in circulation. Second, the major US-based exchanges will comply, rather than cutting off New York. In fact, they have already done most of the work in connection with licensing as Money Service Businesses in many states. Foreign exchanges with substantial New York business will also comply.  The thriving, unlicensed black market for bitcoins in New York that Matonis predicts will never materialize. It is true that some hard-core bitcoiners value their privacy enough to stay away, but these people are already unlikely to be using the exchanges due to existing “know your customer” rules. Some would-be exchange customers may take their business elsewhere. However, this is already priced into the market, since the supply and demand that would be generated by these traders is absent from the exchanges.  Moving beyond the privacy angle, Matonis’ argument doesn’t make economic sense. The pricing paradigm that he suggests would only work in areas with a captive market, which is both technically and socially infeasible with bitcoin.  Exchanges and trading platforms function as market makers for bitcoin, a task which they must carry out efficiently if they want to stay in operation. What it costs to buy bitcoin at a well-run exchange should always stay slightly higher than the equilibrium point and the sell price slightly lower. For exchanges that charge little or nothing in the way of transaction fees, the spread between the buy and sell rates makes up the bulk of operating revenue.  Compared to other commodities, bitcoin movement between markets is almost frictionless. Coins can be very quickly transferred in and out of exchanges, nearly free, and without difficulty, 24 hours a day, every day. Market action tends to be very efficient at adjusting for arbitrage. As a result, the prices at the major exchanges tend to track each other closely, regardless of their location in the world.  The vast majority of purchasers or recipients will be unable to positively identify a “New York bitcoin” and likely wouldn’t care even if they could. Even if a critical mass of traders did force exchanges to discount “tainted” coins, there are plenty of traders who care more about profits than privacy who would gladly buy all the discounted bitcoins they could to sell on other exchanges.  The proposed BitLicense rules are draconian, expensive and unhelpful to new bitcoin exchanges looking to operate in the State of New York. However, I believe that they will not be nearly as disruptive as claimed by the gloom and doom predictions of late. John Matonis is as close to a subject matter expert for bitcoin as you’ll find and his opinions carry significant weight in the community, but I still think he has this one wrong.

42397811,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEHcj,1406916648,Circle Issues $50 to Customer to Cover Unexpected Cash Advance Fee,"Bitcoin financial services startup Circle Internet Financial has issued at least one user a $50 credit in order to help refund that customer for possible cash advance fees he may have incurred using the service.  Circle  , which is currently undertaking a closed test of its platform, appears to be responding to criticisms regarding the charging of cash advance fees, a common headache experienced by those attempting to buy bitcoin with a credit card. As previously reported by PandoDaily, the company was made aware of the cash advance fees and, at the time, promised to investigate the issue.  In an email posted to the bitcoin subreddit, the company informed the user in question that because he had used a credit card, he was at risk of a cash advance fee.  The email read:  “We recently learned that some of our customers are being charged cash advance fees by their credit card issuing banks for deposits made to Circle. We noticed you used a card with us, and we hope that you have not been charged these fees.""  It added: ""Just in case, we’ve sent you $50 in bitcoin for any inconvenience.”  Community response  Community reaction to the development was generally positive.  For example, some observers took to the subreddit to decry cash advance fees as yet another injustice of the traditional financial system, and the customer who received the $50 in bitcoin said that he was pleased with the beta test thus far.  The positive remarks were a far cry from the generally mixed reaction of reddit users to Circle announcements. In recent months, reddit users have taken to the forum to speak out about Circle's closed testing, its business practices and past statements made by its CEO Jeremy Allaire that have at times incited the bitcoin development and altcoin communities.

42397808,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEHbk,1406911090,Hip-Hop Icon Nas: We're Entering the Age of Bitcoin,"Hip-hop heavyweight Nas made a dramatic career move when he traded the thrills of rap superstardom for life in Silicon Valley's tech startup scene.  As founder of the venture capital firm Queensbridge Venture Partners, Nas, full name Nasir Jones, has invested in projects that include popular ride sharing startup Lyft, mobile laundry service Washio and e-commerce platform Fancy, forging connections with tenured VCs in the process.  Through new relationships with Andreessen Horowitz's Ben Horowitz and Chris Dixon, the 40-year-old has also become interested in the burgeoning digital currency space.  Like Dixon and Horowitz, both vocal supporters of the digital currency movement, Jones is similarly bullish about bitcoin's potential – having already invested in financial services provider Coinbase.  Speaking to CoinDesk in a new interview, Jones suggested that bitcoin could be one of history's best investment opportunities:  ""[Bitcoin] will evolve into an industry as big, if not bigger, than the Internet. My man Ben Horowitz really opened my eyes to that point. This isn't of the Internet age, bitcoin is its own age.""  Despite his enthusiasm, Jones also acknowledged that many people still perceive bitcoin as unsafe. However, he suggested that such concerns may be overreaching, adding that time and talent will be enough to overcome them.  ""Obviously challenges will arise from a security and privacy perspective, but the Internet was the same way 20 years ago,"" he said.  Personal bitcoin use  Jones confirmed that he and his team have been buying bitcoin for more than a year, using wallets provided by Coinbase to store funds. While his firm hasn't spent any of the accumulated bitcoins yet, he revealed it may do so soon:  ""[We're] holding onto it for now, but [we're] looking forward to making transactions in the near future.""  In addition to his interest in bitcoin's economics, Jones also harbours a passion for the digital currency's underlying ideology.  ""I was really inspired by the boundaries people were pushing,"" Jones said. ""[Bitcoin] seemed like something people bet against because the government doesn't welcome with open arms what they don't control. But it is such a big idea that it could never be controlled.""  Investment opportunities  On the new investment front, Jones indicated he is still observing the digital currency space – seeking to identify trends and potential opportunities.  He suggested, however, that he may invest in projects focused on bringing bitcoin to people with little or no access to banking services.  ""[I] would love to see how it affects people who don't use credit cards or don't have bank accounts,"" he said. ""[Bitcoin] could be a big opportunity for those folks.""  Jones also discussed his relationship with the Coinbase team, remarking that he was personally struck by their collective talents:  ""The Coinbase guys are great. [Co-founder] Fred [Ehrsam] loves hip hop. How could I not get involved?""  Musical career  Jones is also rumored to be working on his next album, the follow-up to 2012's number one hit 'Life is Good'. In his comments, he suggested the marketing campaign for this album could include bitcoin.  Earlier this year, 50 Cent became one of the first mainstream artists to embrace bitcoin, partnering with merchant processor BitPay for his latest album 'Animal Ambition', released in June.  Though noncommittal, Jones didn't exclude the possibility that he could take a similar approach to future musical releases. He concluded:  ""We are exploring this now: to be continued.""

42397826,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEHqV,1406908046,PayPal Hosts Packed 'Introduction to Bitcoin' Event,"Payments company PayPal, a subsidiary of auction site eBay, hosted a bitcoin event called PayPal TechXploration on 31st July.  The 'Town Hall' space at the PayPal offices in San Jose, California, was packed with hundreds of people, many having to stand. The meetup page for the bitcoin event lists over 700 people that had indicated a desire to attend.  Part of a regular series held by the company, the event included employees of PayPal and eBay, alongside members of the bitcoin community, and was intended to introduce people to the concepts and technology behind bitcoin.  The main speaker on the day was Scott Robinson, who heads the bitcoin incubator program at the Plug and Play Technology Center and hosts a weekly Silicon Valley Bitcoin meetup there every Tuesday night.  During Robinson's presentation, he pointed out that many people probably have not heard about bitcoin because for most, the US dollar has been an effective currency.  He told the audience:  ""We’ve never really been asked questions about the dollar. We’ve never really worried about the dollar.""  Bitcoin technology  Explaining bitcoin to newcomers is not easy, especially with a large audience. Robinson tackled teaching bitcoin at the event by describing bitcoin's novel approach. ""Bitcoin is both a protocol and a currency,"" he said.  Part of Robinson's talk was dedicated to discussing how bitcoin solves the Byzantine Generals problem, an issue that other digital currency predecessors to bitcoin failed to figure out.  Robinson said:  ""The practical consequence of solving this problem means that any Internet user can send digital property to one another.""  During his presentation, Robinson asked how many people at the event owned bitcoin, and about one-third of the audience raised their hands.  Startup showcase  Robinson's goal presenting at the event was twofold: talking about the potential for bitcoin, and informing the audience about the rise and role of bitcoin startups.  ""Bitcoin is a technology that is five years old. It seems a lot like the Internet,"" he said.  He also announced that Plug and Play is offering bitcoin startups $25,000 in funding, office space and mentorship for interested entrepreneurs.  To provide examples of successful bitcoin ventures pushing the technology towards mainstream use, two bitcoin startups briefly talked at the event after Robinson's presentation.  One was 37Coins, an SMS bitcoin wallet service that allows the unbanked access to financial resources via bitcoin and any cellphone.  Jonathan Zobro, co-founder of the company, said:  ""We’re solving the fundamental first step by pushing bitcoin to people.""  To demonstrate its service, the startup gave away $2 in bitcoin to every event attendee who texted a displayed phone number, which then created a 37Coins bitcoin wallet and sent the initial bitcoin balance to that person via SMS.  Xapo's  director of client services, Fernando Gouveia, also briefly spoke about his company, which has been one of the most successful in raising venture capital in the bitcoin space with $40m raised in total.  PayPal and bitcoin  Founded in 1998, PayPal became successful making Internet payments super easy by allowing its users to send money via email addresses.  PayPal is now a large company under the eBay umbrella, and bitcoin as well as other digital currencies have become obvious competitors to its business model.  In June, eBay CEO John Donahoe said that bitcoin is more than just on the company's ""radar screen"" and that it will have to find a way to integrate digital currencies.  However, it's also possible Donahoe and his team might be developing an in-house solution to compete with cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.  At the beginning of this year, CoinDesk reported PayPal had filed a patent to develop digital tokens – a sign it may plan to rival bitcoin in the space.  And, although purely coincidental, PayPal's bitcoin event happened the same day Stripe announced investment in a new project called Stellar with Mt. Gox creator and Ripple Labs co-founder Jed McCaleb.  Stellar has built an open payment platform for money, digital or otherwise, complete with its own altcoin, hoping developers will use its API to allow consumers to transact in any form of money they ultimately choose.

It chose bitcoin as a well-established and widely-recognised digital currency.  Leesa Harwood, RNLI Deputy Director of Fundraising and Communications, said the charity has a long history of innovation in fundraising, having held its first street collection in 1891.  ""Bitcoin is an innovative new kind of currency and we believe that accepting bitcoin will result in donations we may not otherwise receive, as well as connecting us with new types of supporters,” she said.  Harwood added:  “This is a pilot scheme and we are looking forward to seeing how it will proceed as part of our interest in cryptocurrencies and how they may work in the future. We will of course closely monitor how much money is donated. We already have safeguards in place to monitor donations, however we receive them.”  Harwood said that it is ""likely"" that the RNLI will start receiving digital currency donations at some point, hence the decision to form a project team to test the feasibility of accepting bitcoin.  Luke Willams, a member of RLNI's bitcoin project team, told CoinDesk that the group has been investigating the use of digital currencies since early 2014.  Williams explains:  ""We have a regular group that meets to discuss future trends that may impact the RNLI or opportunities that we should investigate. Bitcoin had been mentioned a couple of times and we concluded that at some point in the future we were likely to receive either a donation or legacy in a cryptocurrency.""  Williams added that the RNLI is currently holding its bitcoin donations, but it plans to convert them to fiat as soon as they reach a certain (undisclosed) amount.  Bitcoin for charities  Proponents have been advocating the use of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in fundraising strategies for years.  The comparatively low price of collecting bitcoin donations, the speed at which transactions can be carried out and the global reach of the bitcoin network all make the currency an attractive option for charities.  Leading bitcoin operators are doing their part to promote the use of bitcoin by charities and other non-profit organisations too. Earlier this week Coinbase announced that it will drop all fees for registered non-profit organisations using its platform.  Last month UK charity Comic Relief announced that it is investigating bitcoin donations, saying it plans to address the issue in the near future.  Cryptocurrencies have already been successfully used for a number of fundraisers. The dogecoin community helped the Jamaican bobsleigh team take part in the Sochi Winter Olympics. Cyrptocurrencies have also been used to support the Indian Olympic team, build water wells in Africa and to help Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto and Hal Finney.  However, the full potential of bitcoin fundraisers has not been realised yet, although many organisations like Sean's Outpost have already done a lot of pioneering work in the field.

Online retail giant Overstock has announced plans to offer its employees a bitcoin bonus scheme.  Overstock representative Judd Bagley told Mashable that the company is ""trying to figure out"" how it can pay out bitcoin bonuses and aims to get the program in place by the end of the year.  Under the scheme, Overstock employees will be incentivised to accept their bonuses in bitcoin by offering a premium over cash payments.  Bagley told CoinDesk:  ""The first step will be to offer to pay employees their annual bonuses in bitcoin. Those will be paid out during the first quarter of 2015. Participation will be incentivized by adding a small premium to the bonus for those who opt to receive it in bitcoin. Depending on how that works out and is received, we will look at making regular payroll checks available in bitcoin.""  In January of this year, Overstock became the first major retailer to accept bitcoin payments, with CEO Patrick Byrne telling CoinDesk that cost was the key driver behind the company's decision to embrace bitcoin via a partnership with Coinbase.  Bitcoin sales news  Bagley also told Mashable that Overstock's the most popular items bought with bitcoin were ""sheets"", while bitcoin sales had reached $2m ""just recently"".  Overstock's bitcoin sales passed the $1m mark on the 4th of March, while, Byrne announced that the company had processed a total of $1.6m in bitcoin purchases by late May.  A glance at the figures reveals that Overstock had more bitcoin purchases in the first two months of bitcoin sales than it did in the last five months.  Overstock's initial projections for sales processed with bitcoin were $3-5m this year, but that figure was revised to $10-15m in March. At this point, it seems the original projection might be more realistic.  Bullish on bitcoin  Although bitcoin sales have failed to hit Bryne's optimistic forecast, the company is still committed to bitcoin and seems keen to introduce policies that encourage bitcoin adoption.  A month ago, Byrne said Overstock would start offering ""special deals"" to vendors willing to be paid in bitcoin. The deals could involve discounts and favourable terms. Byrne also revealed Overstock may offer its employees the option to get paid in bitcoin, so the bonus scheme could be just the first step in this process.  In addition to supporting vendors and employees who opt for bitcoin, Overstock also pledged to donate 3% of its bitcoin profits to organisations that promote cryptocurrencies.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/08/01/overstock-to-introduce-bitcoin-bonus-scheme-for-staff,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0c61b99397c2fd56782da90cad2a6d943f73d442-1300x678.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377490,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX71UcT,1406892555,Why Argentina’s Debt Default is an Opportunity for Bitcoin,"James Downer is a student of International Relations and Computer Science and is fascinated by the collision between the two subjects. In this article, Downer discusses last Wednesday's debt default by Argentina, bitcoin's growing role in the country and its thriving black market for dollars.  If Argentina’s 'Default Wednesday' had been as bad as its 2001 debt default, the country's citizens would be scrambling en masse for alternatives to the peso – such as bitcoin.  When Cyprus, with a population of just over a million, suffered a financial crisis in 2013, freezing bank accounts and eventually confiscating money from private accounts, the fear piqued the interests of bitcoin enthusiasts worldwide.  As the situation in Cyprus hit the media, the bitcoin price surged from $47 on 17th March when banks closed, to a staggering $266 on 11th April, shortly after their opening.  Argentina’s 2001 default was eerily similar to the Cyprian crisis with property seizures and frozen accounts. Now Argentina, a country of 41 million, finds itself in default for the eighth time since liberation from Spain.  In the first major sovereign bankruptcy since Cyprus, what might this mean for bitcoin?  A history of the recent troubles    The years of financial troubles which led to Argentina’s default on Wednesday have their roots in the total chaos that gripped Argentina at the end of 2001.      On 21st December 2001, then Argentinian president Fernando de la Rúa fled La Casa Rosada, the presidential office, by helicopter. Because his vice-president had already abandoned his post that October, President of the Senate Ramón Puerta took office for that day and the next. On the 23rd, he passed the baton to Adolfo Rodríguez Saá, who during his one week in office defaulted on Argentina’s debt of $132bn.      Saá's own party withdrew their support for the new president before the 31st and Eduardo Duhalde was appointed his successor. It wasn’t until Néstor Kirchner took office in 2003 that things returned to normal.      The riots that lead to this revolving door started three weeks prior to de la Rúa’s flight, when his government announced a 'corralito', or fencing in of bank accounts. The corralito was a last-ditch attempt to postpone default and maintain dollar reserves by capping the number of pesos that citizens could withdraw at $250 per week.    High-stakes game of chicken    In both the Cyprian and 2001 Argentina defaults, the cause was a clear insufficiency of reserves to pay obligations. Because of this, Argentina’s current default is rather unique.      Argentina elected to play chicken with foreign credit markets, declaring that they wouldn't pay unless the holdouts accepted the same terms as the other 92% of bondholders – 65 cents on the dollar. The restructuring that set these terms occurred in 2005 and 2010.      During this time, Elliot Management Corporation CEO Paul Singer has maintained that his firm deserved to be payed in full, even though they only purchased the bonds for a few cents on the dollar during the default.      This spring it managed to convince a lower New York court, not only that Argentina must pay, but that payments to the other creditors would be held hostage until the country could see eye to eye with Singer. Argentina appealed the case to the US Supreme Court, but the justices refused to hear the case.      The collateral damage from all of this will hurt New York as a financial centre, crush Argentina’s ability to get international credit, and make future restructuring of debt much more difficult.      While the default most certainly doesn’t mean another episode of corralito and property confiscation, it will worsen Argentina’s inflation. The country is currently projected at just shy of 40% inflation for 2014 and is also entering a recession.      Because of the default, foreign credit will be even harder to attract to Argentina and, as a result, the country will be forced to take on more debt and devalue the peso to maintain reserves.      The combination is clear. Inflation will rise and Argentina will remain an outsider to financial capital markets for a while longer.    Inflation could boost bitcoin    Argentina is without a doubt a leader in bitcoin development, use and leadership in Latin America – and high inflation only reinforces this adoption.      Co-founder of the Bitcoin Foundation of Argentina, Franco Daniel Amati echoed the sentiments of every single bitcoin user I’ve talked to in Argentina with his reason for adoption of the digital currency:      “We know the peso will lose value – and probably rapidly. With bitcoin, even if it just maintains price, it’s a huge advantage for us Argentinians.”            Additionally, bitcoin gives common Argentinians options: it offers a solution to the US dollar exchange lockdown that has resulted in a 50% difference between the official and non-official exchange rates. Those who want access to a more stable store of value can have that without frequenting the black market.    Benefits for locals and tourists    The connection between adoption and inflation isn’t just personal, either. BitPagos, an Argentinian payment processor based in Buenos Aires, addresses this exact need by allowing merchants to receive payments in bitcoin.      Founder and CEO, Sebastian Serrano grew wise to this need and has been growing quickly, targeting primarily hotels where foreign clients face enormous charges for using credit cards.      Don’t look to Argentina to be the cause of a short term speculative spike in price, but rather take it as an example of the true uses of bitcoin and the steady adoption of the technology in a country that yearns for financial sanity.
