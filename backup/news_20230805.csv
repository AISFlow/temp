Crypto funds on average generated 15.2% return in the first half of 2023 lol pic.twitter.com/vb8pwYfiX9 — Alex Krüger (@krugermacro) August 5, 2023 Bitcoin outperforming crypto funds is relatively new, as crypto hedge funds are frequently able to outperform the BTC benchmark in the past significantly. But the crypto industry ended 2022 with more of a gloomy sentiment, as the market witnessed regulatory uncertainties and the collapse of FTX and Terra. This seems to have caused crypto hedge funds to take a safer approach, leaving them with larger-than-normal cash positions. When crypto is hot, that cash doesn’t appreciate like BTC would unless the funds’ assets perform significantly better than Bitcoin. The report also noted that directional crypto funds generally outperformed non-directional crypto funds.

15682371,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=545923,1691269255,XRP Whales Trigger Price Decline With Large Selling,"Massive XRP whale wallets are at it again as recently, some of the largest holders of XRP have dumped over 100 million tokens, putting major selling pressure on the XRP price. On-chain data shows that since July 19, the overall supply in addresses holding between 100,000-1,000,000 coins has decreased from 6.85 billion to 6.75 billion. Whales Taking Profit After Pump The actions of whales or large holders of cryptocurrencies seem to always tell the nature of general market sentiment. When whales sell off chunks of their holding, it often triggers a cascade of smaller holders selling in response, driving the price down. Related Reading: These Are The Factors That Could Lead To Another Bitcoin Rally: ARK Invest While retail investors and smaller holders often get caught up in the excitement of price rises and buy-in at the top, whales are more likely to sell off after massive price jumps and buy back in after the pullback. Right now, XRP whales may be taking some profits after the recent pump in price following news of partial victory in the SEC case. The price of XRP rose over 70% in less than 24 hours to $0.85 on the back of the news but has since declined about 15% from the yearly high. Data shows that the price decline started two weeks ago, around the same time when XRP whales started selling off their holdings. Token price falls to $0.62 following whale dumps | Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com What’s Next For XRP? The XRP ecosystem faced a similar selloff in June, as whales dumped around 120 million XRP after Ripple unlocked its escrow to add another 1 billion tokens into circulation. Sell-offs are likely to trigger more selloffs. So In the short term, we’re likely to see some price volatility and fluctuations as the market absorbs the impact of such a large amount of tokens entering circulation. The price of XRP, on the other hand, is doing well compared to the overall market. It was reported earlier last month that whales have been amassing more than $500 million in XRP since February in anticipation of positive developments within the ecosystem. Ripple, the company behind the altcoin, says it is now eyeing the tokenized assets market as it hopes to unlock trillions of dollars of value in the global financial system. Related Reading: Bank Of Canada Study Shows Crypto Ownership In The Country Fell In The Last 2 Years However, Ripple’s partial victory in court seems to be standing on one foot, as analysts expect an appeal from the SEC.

This price loss amplifies BTC’s negative monthly performance, pushing its total loss in the last 30 days to around 5.38%, according to data from CoinMarketCap. At the time of writing, the premier cryptocurrency is trading at around $29,022, with its daily trading volume valued at $10.746 billion, having gone down 12.54%. However, amidst Bitcoin’s current downtrend, it appears the token’s larger performance could be indicating a bullish market in the coming months. Related Reading: These Are The Factors That Could Lead To Another Bitcoin Rally: ARK Invest Bitcoin Could Be Repeating Historic Bullish Price Cycle – What Does This Mean? On Aug. 4, crypto analyst Ali Martinez on social media platform X posted that Bitcoin is likely repeating a popular bullish cycle of its price history. According to Ali, the token current’s price trajectory since attaining its all-time high in November 2021 is identical to its price movement between 2013 and 2017 based on data from Glassnode. Bitcoin price performance since cycle ATH | Source: Glassnode If this analysis proves correct, with Bitcoin mirroring its 2013-2017 price cycle, it means Bitcoin is expected to show little price movement in August 2023 and September 2023, perhaps recording some slight gains along the way. However, Glassnode data shows BTC could experience a price upswing in October 2023, maintaining a bullish momentum all through this month. Thereafter, the token is expected to undergo a major re-correction finding support in the first week of November 2023. Based on the reference price cycle, Bitcoin could then experience a significant price drop in the last month of 2023 but close the year in a strong consolidation zone. Source: Glassnode Beyond 2023, the BTC market could also be set for huge profits in 2024 and 2025 if Bitcoin is indeed repeating the 2013-2017 price cycle during which the market leader famously gained by over 1600%. However, all investors are reminded that predictions are not guaranteed and should not be considered as investment advice. Rising Optimism In The BTC Market In other news, it appears there is a rising positive sentiment around Bitcoin, with a significant increase in its accumulation by key holders.

15672592,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=545877,1691258737,Optimism (OP) Tallies 13% In 7 Days Despite High Profile DeFi Hack,"In the midst of the ever-changing cryptocurrency landscape, Optimism (OP) has shown remarkable resilience, posting a notable price increase of 13.53% in the past seven days. Despite facing a slight decline of 1.80% in the last 24 hours and a further 1.35% shrinkage within the hour, Optimism remains on an upward trajectory. With the current price sitting at $1.68 per OP and still 48.38% below its all-time high of $3.26, traders and investors are eager to uncover the reasons behind its recent gains. This article explores the factors contributing to Optimism’s recent surge and analyzes its prospects. High Profile Hack Could Stall Optimism (OP) Bullish Trajectory Optimism’s positive trajectory took an unexpected turn when Coinbase’s newly launched BASE network, built on the Optimism Stack, fell victim to a backdoor contract exploit. This unfortunate event resulted in the loss of 597 Ether, equivalent to approximately $1 million. The exploit involved infiltrating a backdoor contract on the BASE Chain, which enabled the continuous minting of tokens that were subsequently sold for profit. The exploiters managed to mint 40 different tokens, generating significant profit, which was then moved out of the perpetrators’ address. Related Reading: Curve Finance Exploiter Returns 61,000 ETH After Protocol’s Stern Warning As BASE anchors the OP Stack, there are concerns that the recent exploit could have repercussions on all associated protocols, including the Optimism network. Furthermore, the hype surrounding BASE had attracted several new addresses to the Optimism network, potentially dampening investor sentiment and a subsequent impact on OP’s price. The number of active addresses on the Optimism network increased following BASE’s launch in late February. However, the recent hack may stall this growth, as investors might exercise caution in the wake of the exploit. Will The Bulls Sustain The Impressive Rally? Despite the recent BASE exploit, Optimism (OP) has managed to maintain a sense of optimism in the market. The OP/USD daily chart displays promising signs of bullish momentum, with the bulls surpassing critical support levels. Short green candlesticks formed above the $1.631 support level indicate the market’s resilience and determination to keep the price afloat despite the challenges posed by the recent exploit. The technical indicators further reinforce the bullish outlook for Optimism. The Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) remains above the signal line, characterized by green histogram bars that signify the asset’s bullish momentum. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has entered the overbought region, reaching a value of 75. This suggests a considerable increase in buying pressure on OP as investors show confidence in the token’s potential for future growth. Related Reading: Coinbase Research Expert Decodes Latest Crypto And Finance Market Trends However, while the market sentiment remains positive, traders and investors should exercise caution. The recent BASE exploit has raised concerns about the potential impact on Optimism’s network and the broader sentiment surrounding the token. The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, and external events can have significant implications for token prices. It is crucial for market participants to closely monitor developments related to the exploit and assess any potential consequences for Optimism’s price trajectory. Despite the positive indicators and bullish momentum, staying informed and vigilant in such a rapidly changing market is essential for making well-informed decisions.

15676285,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=545861,1691255137,"Tether May Now Be 11th Largest Bitcoin Holder, Analyst Says","Tether, the company behind the USDT stablecoin, may now be the 11th largest bitcoin holder in the world. This comes after the stablecoin issuer recently published its attestation report for Q2 2023. According to the report, Tether recorded an increase in excess reserves, which grew by $850 million. This brought the company’s total excess reserves to approximately $3.3 billion. These excess reserves are profits that the company does not distribute to shareholders as dividends. Instead, Tether keeps them to shore up its 100% reserves, which are used to back all USDT in circulation and keep the token stable. Related Reading: USDT Issuer Tether Reports A 30% Decline In Profit Tether Holds $1.6 Billion Worth Of BTC In Single Wallet? In the last quarter, Tether published that it held more than $1.5 billion worth of BTC (about 53,495 BTC) in its reserves. Based on the latest quarterly report, this figure has grown by more than $176 million, bringing the company’s Bitcoin holdings to roughly $1.676 billion (around 55,022 BTC). Tom Wan, a research analyst at 21.co, found in the last quarter that Tether may be holding all their Bitcoin in one wallet, making them the 12th largest BTC holder at the time. Fast forward to Q2 2023, it appears that the analyst has confirmed his initial speculations. In the first quarter, the BTC holdings of Tether’s “possible” wallet address matched the BTC amount published in the company’s attestation report. The BTC balance of this address has also increased in the second quarter, corresponding with the amount provided in Tether’s Q2 report. The analyst noted that only one Bitcoin address matches the figures of Tether’s BTC reserves. And this address, which may belong to the stablecoin issuer, is now the 11th largest Bitcoin holder in the world. While Wan sought Tether and the company’s CTO Paolo Ardoino to corroborate his findings, there has been no official confirmation from the stablecoin issuer. Tether’s BTC Holdings Consistent With Initial Plans This significant amount of BTC Tether holds in its reserves comes as no surprise, especially as the firm has always been clear about its Bitcoin investment intentions. In May, the stablecoin issuer announced plans to invest 15% of its future profit in Bitcoin. Tether’s CTO Paolo Ardoino, a vocal supporter of Bitcoin, stated that the cryptocurrency’s resilience is the reason for the company’s continuous investment in the asset. Ardoino said: The decision to invest in Bitcoin, the world’s first and largest cryptocurrency, is underpinned by its strength and potential as an investment asset. Bitcoin has continually proven its resilience and has emerged as a long-term store of value with substantial growth potential. Its limited supply, decentralized nature, and widespread adoption have positioned Bitcoin as a favored choice among institutional and retail investors alike.

The coin has increased by more than 25% over the last week as a result of the ecosystem’s overall buzz. The price of Bone Shibaswap has made a significant recovery in recent months. After soaring to a high of $1.7410, the highest point since March, it exceeded several of the initially pessimistic expectations. BONE price all in green in the weekend chart. TradingView.com BONE Showing Solid Performance While the price of Bitcoin and Ethereum has stabilized, the BONE cryptocurrency has increased by more than 130% since its June lows. The anticipation stems from the belief that the upcoming August mainnet release of Shibarium will mark the beginning of a transformative era. Ever since the launch timeline was disclosed earlier, members of the community have been attributing special significance to this event, particularly emphasizing the role of BONE. BONEUSD trading at $1.74 on the weekly chart: TradingView.com This enthusiasm is fueled by the potential impact of Shibarium’s launch on the overall landscape and the specific importance of BONE within this context. The idea of a crypto exchange is among the most crucial ones in the field of crypto. Because cryptocurrencies don’t have an inherent worth, having a market where they may be purchased, sold, or traded aids in determining their price.

42410045,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcRwfw,1691251500,NFT Trading Is Ice Cold But Developers Are Still Hot for Web3,"New reports were released that point to a major slowdown in NFT trading. Still, developers continue to deploy millions of smart contracts across EVM-compatible chains, pointing to interest in finding broader use cases for blockchain tokens.  Meanwhile, Etihad Airways announced plans to launch a Web3 loyalty program that will let its community of frequent fliers stake NFTs for miles. Plus, the team behind the Ordinals protocol is launching a non-profit to keep its development “clean” from corporate influence.  You’re reading The Airdrop, our weekly newsletter where we discuss the biggest stories across Web3. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Friday.  This Week's Alpha  Non-fungible trading woes: It’s been a no-good, very bad month for NFT trading, according to two new reports.  NFT trading volume is down: According to a new report from Web3 developer platform Alchemy, NFT trading volume fell 41% in the second quarter of 2023. Blake Tandowsky, growth analyst at Alchemy, told CoinDesk that whale NFT trading volumes peaked in Q2 2022, but as time went on, new entrants began to taper off. He suggested that NFTs need to figure out new use cases beyond their original JPEG iteration.  NFT sales have slowed: Another report from analytics firm DappRadar that sales of NFTs dropped by nearly half from January to July. In addition, the floor prices of blue chip collections like Bored Ape Yacht Club and Azuki sunk to two-year lows, indicating waning interest among traders to pay top dollar for the collections.  Silver linings? Polygon NFTs are still crushing and dominated a decent share of all trades in July. Meanwhile, Web3 developers are unperturbed by the gloomy numbers and continue to deploy millions of smart contracts across EVM-compatible chains, pointing to steady interest in decentralized apps and broader Web3 use cases.  High stakes: Etihad Airways, which has been steadily releasing NFTs through its EY-ZERO1 collection, has announced plans to launch a new Web3 loyalty program called ""Horizon Club."" Holders of its NFTs already have access to a number of perks, including Etihad Guest Silver Tier Status, priority check-in and lounge access. But beginning in September, the loyalty program will allow EY-ZERO1 collectors to stake their NFTs for miles that can be redeemed for flights, upgrades and other perks.  Web3 loyalty programs are booming: Many major brands, including Starbucks, have recently adopted loyalty programs that incorporate blockchain technology and NFT rewards. The aviation industry has been slower to adopt these programs, though a number of airlines have started to embrace NFT ticketing and metaverse travel experiences.  Funding for Ordinals: Ordinals, the protocol that allows NFTs to be added to the Bitcoin blockchain, is establishing a non-profit organization to ensure that its developers get compensated for their work in a way that does not compromise their neutrality. Inscriptions on Bitcoin’s mainnet were first introduced by programmer Casey Rodarmor in January and paved the way for Bitcoin NFTs, though the development of the technology was mostly funded privately by Rodarmor and gifted contributions to the core developers.  Keeping Ordinals free of corporate influence: The Open Ordinals Institute, a registered 501(c)(3), will collect donations in bitcoin and share progress on the protocol development. “Given Ordinals' unprecedented pace of adoption and real-world implications for various crypto-economies, we believe it is crucial to fund a strong team of non-corporate funded developers to ensure the security and neutrality of this open-source protocol,” said Erin Redwin, Open Ordinals Institute board member.  NFTs as an area of growth: Redwin said that the non-profit is interested in growing the newly-discovered utility of Bitcoin-based NFTs. “Companies across Web3 ecosystems – including Ethereum, Solana, Stacks and others – are quickly building Ordinals infrastructure after previously believing NFT-functionality ‘wasn't possible’ on native Bitcoin,” he said.  Project Spotlight  CryptoPunks  Who: Larva Labs’ CryptoPunks (now owned by Yuga Labs)  What: CryptoPunks, one of the earliest NFT projects on Ethereum and also one of the most popular collections of all time, experienced a number of high-profile trades this week, including one from prolific NFT artist Beeple. His first profile-picture (PFP) NFT purchase, the clownish Punk #4953 set the stage for other high-value buys, including Punks #6634, which sold for 235 ETH (about $432,000) and Punk #3307, which sold for 500 ETH (about $915,000).  How: While the broader NFT market is down, and it's rarer to see big money trades happen as often as they used to, the latest CryptoPunks pump is a positive sign that an NFT renaissance may be in our future. Plus, it boosts morale to see well-known figures like Beeple get involved in particular NFT communities – he even announced plans to host a Punks meetup at his Charleston studio in September.  In Other News  Gucci’s got the goods: Holders of the 2,896 Gucci Vault Material NFTs, released by the luxury house in March, can soon exchange their NFTs for a wallet or bag.  Tee time: Web3 golf community LinksDAO has launched a number of new membership options as it renovates its newly-purchased Spey Bay Golf Course in Scotland.  King of the jungle: Bored Ape parent company Yuga Labs will acquire metaverse-focused Roar Studios to build out its vision for Otherside.

The applications currently stand at 12, with the latest addition coming from ProShares, a popular fund manager. The platform filed four applications for Ether-based ETFs, including a dual Ether and Bitcoin futures strategy ETF, an Ether Strategy ETF, and a short Ether Strategy ETF. Will The SEC Approve An Ethereum Futures ETF? The recent surge in applications started on the 28th of July this year after Volatility Shares filed its application. Ever since, other asset management companies, including ProShares, Roundhill Financial, Bitwise, Van Eck, and Grayscale Investment, have filled submissions, with some bringing multiple applications. Related Reading: These Are The Factors That Could Lead To Another Bitcoin Rally: ARK Invest The most recent application, filed on August 3 by ProShares, proposes an equal-weight Bitcoin and Ether ETF to measure the performance of holding long positions in the nearest maturing monthly Ether and Bitcoin contracts. According to renowned Financial Expert at Bloomberg Intelligence, James Seyffart, ProShare filed four separate applications with the SEC. Bitwise also submitted three applications, while Grayscale Investments filed two applications. However, despite the growing optimism, it remains to be seen if the Securities and Exchange Commission will approve these filings. The SEC has never approved an ETF that tracks Ether Futures contracts, unlike Bitcoin Futures ETFs that have been around since October 2021. Many market experts have argued that these applications are a mere gamble by these asset management companies, who do not want to miss out on being the first Ethereum ETF in the United States. ETH price holds steady above $1,830 amid ETF race | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com The likelihood of receiving the SEC’s approval remains slim as the regulatory body has never approved an Ethereum futures ETF filing. Add to the mix the consistent refusal of SEC’s Chair, Gary Gensler, consistent refusal to answer if the agency considers ETH a security. This has further compounded regulatory uncertainty around the network. If none of the applications before the SEC get denied, the Ether ETFs will launch 75 days from their respective filing dates. Analysts expect the Volatility Shares ETF to lead the charge on 12th October. Understanding The Difference Between Futures And Spot ETF Products The primary difference between futures and spot ETF products lies in the fact that while the former tracks the price of futures contracts, the latter requires the issuers to purchase the underlying assets. Spot ETFs are generally considered more valid since they require the fund manager to purchase and hold underlying assets. Related Reading: Bank Of Canada Study Shows Crypto Ownership In The Country Fell In The Last 2 Years The current spike in Ether-based applications comes amidst a wave of filings from leading asset management companies, including BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, among others. These companies are looking to offer the first spot in Bitcoin ETF in the US. Investors and members of the crypto community remain expectant of the outcome of the SEC’s consideration of the applications lying before it. Whatever decision the agency takes is likely to affect the attractiveness and accessibility of crypto investments, especially for larger institutional investors.

The lawsuit was brought on by plaintiffs who alleged Tether was falsely advertising its USDT stablecoin. A Big Win For Tether And Bitfinex The ruling is being seen as a significant win for the two entities and was announced in a blog post published on Tether’s official website. The post stated that the Chief Judge delivered a comprehensive and incisive 6-page decision, including an order to dismiss the class action lawsuit against the two entities, adding that it lacked merit. The post stated, “Today, Chief Judge Laura Taylor Swain of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District Of New York issued a comprehensive and incisive 6-page decision that included an order dismissing the meritless class action lawsuit filed by Matthew Anderson and Shawn Dolifka against Tether and Bitfinex companies in its entirety.” The lawsuit was brought on by plaintiffs Shawn Dolifka and Matthew Anderson. The plaintiffs claimed that Tether had falsely advertised its USDT stablecoin being backed in a 1:1 ratio by the U.S. dollar. However, the court did not buy their argument. Tether added that the fact that the entirety of the lawsuit was dismissed at such an early stage showed that the allegation against it and Bitfinex were devoid of any merit. Tether And Bitfinex CTO Reacts The verdict sparked a wave of reactions from the crypto ecosystem. Paolo Ardoino, Tether, and Bitfinex CTO took to X (formerly Twitter) and expressed his satisfaction with the ruling. “Tether and Bitfinex Win Comprehensive Legal Victory as U.S. District Court Dismisses Class Action Lawsuit The Court correctly held that the plaintiffs’ complaint lacked any “plausible allegations of injury” because it includes no facts showing that “USDT had a diminished actual value at all.” Prominent Bitcoin lawyer Stuart Hoegner applauded the Tether team’s efforts and broke down the court ruling in a long thread on X. The Court Ruling The court gave several reasons for throwing out the lawsuit. It stated that the plaintiffs had not provided sufficient facts in the case nor mentioned the buying or selling price of USDT for the plaintiffs. The court further added that market data showed that USDT still maintains its peg with the USD at $1, and even if there were misrepresentations from the defendant’s side, there was no evidence that showed USDT had lost its value. The Complaint In Question The case stems from a complaint filed in 2021 when the plaintiffs, Shawn Dolifika and Matthew Anderson, claimed that Tether’s statement that its USDT was backed by the U.S. dollar in a 1:1 peg was false. According to the complaint, Tether and Bitfinex did not maintain adequate reserves for the USDT in circulation. Furthermore, the complaint also alleged that the reserves did not contain USD as advertised but were a mix of assets such as overcollateralized loans and undisclosed commercial paper. “Defendants did not maintain the same amount of reserves as Tether tokens in circulation.

The firm, which recently turned six, keeps racking up several achievements despite the FUD that has surrounded it in recent times. A Worthy Feat For Binance The world’s largest crypto exchange by daily trading volume has recently disclosed that its registered users now stand at a whopping 150 million. This was revealed in a tweet by its CEO, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, on Thursday. Related Reading: Bitstamp Makes Highly Anticipated XRP Announcement, But Does It Live Up To The Hype? In the tweet, CZ noted his company’s milestone amidst growing regulatory scrutiny of its operations the world over. However, despite navigating through different challenges, Binance has managed to captivate the interest of several millions of users around the globe. So this is a testament to the platform’s quality service delivery and amazing features. Just over a year ago, in July 2022, the exchange’s user base stood at about 120 million. The astonishing growth of 30 million users within the span of just 12 months tells of Binance’s undeniable hold in the constantly evolving cryptocurrency ecosystem. A cursory look at the platform’s traffic data for the last three months shows that the top five nations contributing to this spike are Vietnam, India, Russia, Turkey, and Argentina. The increased expansion across various diverse geographies demonstrates the heightened acceptance and penetration of digital currencies. BNB price trends at $241 as users base reaches new high | Source: BNBUSD on Tradingview.com Navigating Regulatory Challenges As expected, with growth comes challenges and Binance’s journey has not always been all growth and triumph. The platform has been the subject of various legal challenges across diverse jurisdictions. The exchange was recently charged with “will evasion” and fraud by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in June this year. In Europe, Binance is under probe by French regulators who accused the platform of engaging in money laundering. It has also been ordered to cease rendering crypto services by Belgium’s financial watchdog. In China, the services of the platform are restricted and inaccessible to millions of users within the country. Binance has also withdrawn its license applications and canceled its registration bids in several countries. Related Reading: Crypto Trading Volumes Fall To Lowest Level In 2023 Amid Bear Market Woes However, Binance has been able to make some gains in recent times. Earlier this month, it restored services in Japan, following the purchase of the local exchange Sakura Exchange BitCoin (SEBC) in November 2022. It has also been given a license to render cryptocurrency services in Dubai. All these hurdles make the latest milestone not only remarkable but testamentary.

42410035,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcRwFU,1691233200,DeFi Definitely Isn't Dead,"I’ve seen a couple articles in the past few days about the death and decay of decentralized finance (DeFi).  The impetus has been the recent issues in DeFi caused by an exploit and crypto founder who is a horrible risk manager. In short: The founder of a prominent automated market maker (AMM) Curve Finance loaned out nearly half of the protocol’s CRV tokens on a few DeFi lenders, and was almost liquidated after an unexpected but somewhat predictable DeFi exploit depreciated the price of CRV.  Adam Blumberg is a certified financial planner as well as the co-founder and chief educator for Interaxis, a company trying to bridge the education gap between digital assets and traditional finance. He is a contributing writer for CoinDesk’s ""Crypto for Advisors"" newsletter.  The first article was a great op-ed in CoinDesk, written by Daniel Kuhn, who said DeFi is “dead inside.” The second was a report from JPMorgan, which argued the overall sector is in “shrinking or stalling mode.” These commentators couldn't be further from the truth, however.  I don’t think DeFi is dead, nor is it shrinking.  The idea of what DeFi was during the summer of 2020 is certainly, and thankfully dead. It was a time of too much bribery, liquidity and talk of yield. “Yield farming,” the fuel to DeFi Summer’s fire, eventually calmed down and a few decentralized platforms emerged as market leaders – many of which took professional “white glove” services in aim for expansion.  But the sector is not perfect. As Daniel noted, we also have far too much power in the hands of too few people. Sounds too familiar.  The difference with this technology versus tech of the past, is that DeFi has been financialized to an extreme. It's not ideal when a bunch of programmers start playing financiers.  But we need to remember, we’re still experimenting with the technology. We’re not sure how to use it. Mistakes will be made.  What we’ve accomplished in the last few years is to build robust systems that don’t operate within the confines of traditional corporations, banking rails or even geographical borders. The system has been secure enough that the financial and corporate heavyweights like Mastercard, Visa, Coca Cola, Anheuser Busch, Nike, Starbucks, BNY Mellon, BlackRock and Fidelity are devoting money and internal resources to utilizing the technology for greater efficiency.  DeFi will continue to be challenging. It will get even harder as DeFi continues to grow.  These early experiments and corporate explorations show that DeFi can professionalize, and that its market growth does not always need to be driven by FOMO.  Still, while the dream of many is for complete decentralization of all the financial systems, the reality will never match up…at least not in our lifetime. What has been hardest to figure out is the balance of power between self-executing code and the humans that build it.  Curve is just an example: You can’t take the human out of humans. But that’s OK.  We went even further down the road of decentralization with DAO Summer of 2021. It became a given that everyone could join a decentralized autonomous organization through a Discord link, start working for recently minted tokens and get a say in the organization. Until, of course, the founders and investors decide to vote. Then we’re back to corporate hierarchy.  This isn’t meant to be negative but to say that it’s working, even if it doesn’t always seem to. The thing is, DeFi will continue to be challenging. It will get even harder as DeFi continues to grow and butt up against the real world and people who weren’t self-motivated enough to go down the crypto rabbit hole.  On one side of the crypto divide, we have those who want to keep the traditional economic, financial and corporate system where the Federal Reserve decides on the money supply, the banks control the money and the government tells us what we can and can’t invest in. In that system, the major, publicly held companies get to control our data, and there isn’t much we can do about it.  On the other extreme, we have The Degens, or traders, builders and protocol creators who want to vote on everything based on token count and run the world on money made via computer code.  In reality we'll likely end up somewhere in between.  There are still trillions of dollars in real estate, private and public companies and debt instruments that all need to be accounted for, traded and borrowed against. Those are not going on-chain overnight. But the world is heading there.  See also: Tokenize Everything: Institutions Bet on Crypto's Future  And when we do see more assets denoted on-chain, DeFi will be waiting to provide loans, liquidity and transparency. It’s worth saying that Curve CEO Michael Egorov took out loans in accordance with the system, and the world was able to learn about his potentially toxic debt because it was all on-chain. Many people even called him out. Where else in finance would such dangers be public knowledge?  The successful growth of the DeFi ecosystem and technology has swung the pendulum and shifted the center. It’s possible that because DeFi offers transparency, efficiency, disintermediation and self-custody this will become the norm across the entire financial system. Otherwise banks will get outcompeted by the innovation happening in lending, borrowing and insurance, which offers more people more chances to participate.  The experiments aren’t perfect, but that’s why they’re experiments. While the Curve situation is unsettling, the move toward decentralization means we just have to let the market work. Let the protocols, teams and systems make the necessary changes.  DeFi isn’t dead or dying at all. In fact it’s really just coming to light.",NEUTRAL,CRV,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | CRV | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Adam Blumberg,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/08/05/defi-definitely-isnt-dead,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3dfcc86aa43a91f0c735fa699606351b64303d43-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

15663799,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=545863,1691225187,These Are The Factors That Could Lead To Another Bitcoin Rally: ARK Invest,"In a report released on August 4, ARK Invest’s on-chain researcher David Puell reveals factors that could lead to another Bitcoin rally. The report, titled “The Bitcoin Monthly: July 2023,” provides an in-depth analysis and distinguishes between Bitcoin’s current situation and what the future holds for the largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Some Positives For Bitcoin Puell highlights how Bitcoin’s tepid 90-day volatility shares similarities with 2017 levels. According to the report, this prolonged low volatility usually represents the ‘calm before the storm,’ with Puell speculating that a significant price movement will likely happen soon. However, whether it will be a breakout or a breakdown remains uncertain. Related Reading: Bank Of Canada Study Shows Crypto Ownership In The Country Fell In The Last 2 Years There is cause for optimism, though, as the decrease in hash rate on the blockchain provides an optimistic signal. The decrease could signify oversold conditions – whereby Bitcoin is currently trading below its actual worth, and considering that it has traded at an undervalued price for a long while now, we could see an upward trend, which would signify a price reversal. Additionally, there has been an increase in “liveliness” as selling pressure has reduced and more holders are choosing to ‘HODL.’ The report states that liveliness fell below 60% in July, the lowest selling pressure since Q4 of 2020. The short-term holders’ profit/loss ratio also coincides with historical trend reversals, signifying that a breakout is more likely to occur. The report states: This breakeven level correlates both with local bottoms during primary bull markets and with local tops during bear market environments. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve’s continued hike rate has been known to be a macro factor on Bitcoin and the crypto market. Puell believes that the Fed’s actions could significantly impact Bitcoin’s performance and the economy as a whole. A potential slowdown in CPI (consumer product index) inflation could see a surge in Bitcoin’s appeal as a non-inflammatory asset. BTC struggles to hold $29,000 support | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com Binance Could Have A Domino Effect On BTC The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (BTC) filed a lawsuit against Binance for trading unregistered securities, amongst other allegations. This ongoing legal tussle could affect Bitcoin’s performance and the crypto market. According to the report, Binance’s BNB token ensures stability in the crypto market by providing significant liquidity for other cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin. If sentiments begin to tilt in favor of the SEC and DOJ, it could trigger a “bank run,” which would see BNB’s price plummet, causing a domino effect on the crypto market. Related Reading: Crypto Trading Volumes Fall To Lowest Level In 2023 Amid Bear Market Woes While historical trends signify a bullish trajectory for Bitcoin’s price, the token might be marred by macroeconomic forces and regulatory concerns. It is believed that Bitcoin breaching the resistance level at $29,450 could shape its future outlook. As Bitcoin continues to witness a downward trajectory, that resistance level might be the key to a sustained breakout or further consolidation.
