Hiccups aside, Byrne told CoinDesk the sale ultimately attracted a big crowd – some 2,000 accredited investors.  As such, he indicated the company may move to shorten the initial two-month timeframe for the token sale.  ""We had, yesterday, 2,000 accredited investors come and apply and get the process going,"" Byrne said, adding that he had taken several phone calls from investors himself.  Some of the offers, he said, were as high as $5 million or more for single token allocations.

The trading system grew out of the Medici blockchain effort within online retail giant Overstock, an initiative that dates back to 2014 and is aimed at creating a wholly new kind of trading environment based on a blockchain.  The company announced yesterday that the pre-sale and the subsequent sale would be limited to accredited investors – allocating a month for each sale – while reserving the right to shorten either if necessary. The pre-sale to strategic purchasers will be limited to $100 million, with the remaining $150 million open to all accredited investors, CoinDesk has learned.

Questions have also arisen concerning potentially manipulative transactions in the company's stock in November 2017.""  The little-known company has seen its stock soar in recent weeks, according to data from MarketWatch. The price is up more than 1,800 percent in the past month, with a market capitalization in excess of $11 billion.  The firm is one of a number of publicly-traded companies that have seen their stock prices jump amid a boom in the price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, with that market rising past $600 billion in total market capitalization yesterday. As reported by Bloomberg, The Crypto Company recently completed a stock sale for accredited investors at a price of just $7.  The Crypto Company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

""I think the value of bitcoin is exceptionally ambiguous,"" he told CNBC today.  The comment is perhaps notable in that it comes from a legendary economist who gained long-term credibility following his work around the 1987 stock market crash and the housing bubble in 2008. He received the Nobel Prize in Economics in October 2013.  Yet speaking to the network, Shiller argued that it's difficult to peg the fundamental price of bitcoin, remarking:  ""You just put an upper bound on [bitcoin] with the value of the world's money supply. But that upper bound is awfully big. So it can be anywhere between zero and there.""  That same sentiment was reflected in Shiller's recent op-ed article for The New York Times, in which he wrote: ""How can we even start estimating the fundamental value of bitcoin, with its astonishing market value of more than $275 billion? Any attempt will soon sound silly.""  Bitcoin's price has surged in value since the beginning the year, climbing from $800 last January to a new record of almost $20,000 this weekend, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.  Shiller cited a phenomenon that may explain the reasons behind such a phenomenal market rally. According to neuroscientists, he said, our brains work differently when making choices in a stressful, ambiguous environment.  ""You might think people who are educated will transform the decision problem into something precise ... But it doesn't seem like the brain is doing that,"" Shiller told CNBC.

A message on Youbit's official website posted today states that, at around 4:34 a.m. local time, an external hack resulted in the loss of ""about 17 percent of total assets.""  The cyber attack is the second for Youbit, previously known Yapizon. The exchange was previously targeted in April in an attack which South Korean officials believe was conducted with the support of neighboring North Korea. Recent reports indicate that intelligence services in South Korea suspect that North Korea is behind additional attacks against domestic cryptocurrency exchanges, including market-leader Bithumb.  As a result of today's attack, Youbit said that it has halted deposits and withdrawals. According to Reuters, investigators have begun looking into the situation.  And while the company suggested that users may not see the full return of their funds, the statement indicated that Youbit would be disbursing the cryptocurrency it still has in its possession.  ""Due to bankruptcy, the settlement of cash and coins will be carried out in accordance with all bankruptcy procedures,"" the exchange said in a translated statement. ""However, in order to minimize the damage to our members, we will arrange for the withdrawal of approximately 75 percent of the balance at 4:00 a.m. on Dec 19, The rest of the unpaid portion will be paid after the final settlement is completed.""  The moves are being taken despite what Youbit characterized as a less severe intrusion compared to the one in April. The company also suggested that it would seek to pare losses by tapping insurance funds and selling a stake in the exchange.  ""We will do our best to minimize the loss of our members by 17 percent , through various methods such as cyber comprehensive insurance (3 billion [won]) and selling the operating rights of the company,"" the company wrote.

42380173,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MH4n,1513694722,Estonia Inches Closer to National 'Crypto Token' Launch,"The Baltic nation of Estonia is moving closer toward the potential launch of its own crypto token.  In a blog post published today, Kaspar Korjus, managing director of the country's e-Residency initiative, set out three possible use cases for the token – dubbed ""estcoin"" – that have been arrived at since the concept was first aired in August. As Korjus noted in his blog post, the concept quickly went viral as speculation swirled that Estonia might become the first country with its own dedicated digital currency.  And while the e-Residency program isn't yet launching the token, Korjus laid out some of the conceptual groundwork in the new blog post, noting the different ways in which the cryptocurrency might be used – as well as how the e-Residency program could serve as a basis for how initial coin offerings within the Baltic nation could be conducted.  Firstly, Korjus sets out the case for a ""community estcoin,"" which would be aimed to support the objective of developing Estonia's aims to build a ""digital nation"" by incentivising people to ""apply for and make greater use of e-Residency.""  This could include rewards schemes that pay out in estcoin, encouraging businesses to adopt the token, and also includes ""encouraging investors and entrepreneurs to use e-Residency as their platform for trusted ICO activity,"" he said.  A second use case for the token would be to provide a basis for secure, government-issued digital identities.  In this role, estcoins would be used as ""blockchain-based tokens used for activities within our digital society, such as digitally signing documents, logging into services or enforcing smart contracts,"" Korjus indicates.  While ""identity estcoins"" may ultimately need to be bought by users of the e-Residency scheme, they would not raise revenue for the nation, ""but merely contribute to the maintenance of the network,"" the post indicates.  Euro-backed coins?  However, a third – and perhaps more controversial – option could see the token pegged to the price of the euro – an idea that was blasted by European Central Bank president Mario Draghi.  ""No member state can introduce its own currency; the currency of the euro zone is the euro,"" Draghi said of the concept in September.  Korjus said that, while Estonia would ""never provide an alternative currency to the euro, ... it's possible that we could combine some of the decentralised advantages of crypto with the stability and trust of fiat currency and then limit its use within the e-resident community.""  This fiscal use case for the token would require banks to move money in and out of the scheme, according to the post. However, once on the blockchain, ""community-based value exchanges could take place globally for free.""  ""All that is required is a digital wallet and the commitment of government to buy back every euro estcoin for one euro,"" according to Korjus.  Since it was originally announced, the estcoin scheme has been both praised and criticised as ""a solution looking for a problem."" While acknowledging the latter view, Korjus said:  ""Since the estcoin proposal was made, we've been carefully reading and listening to feedback from around the world. As a result, we do now have a better understanding of not just how estcoin could be structured, but also why people would want to hold them.""

Bitcoin cash (BCH) was last seen trading at $2,350 levels, meaning the 21 percent rally seen in the last 24 hours has pushed the gains since its launch to 316 percent.  Meanwhile, week-on-week, BCH has appreciated 43 percent.  The stellar rally is a part of the broad-based strength witnessed in the alternative currencies since last Tuesday. With bitcoin (large cap) showing signs of fatigue near the $20,000 mark, the rotation to small caps seems to have gathered pace. This is evident from the spike in trading volumes on exchanges offering BCH/BTC pairs.  Also, the investor community may have bought BCH on speculation that integration with payment processor BitPay would open the doors to more widespread adoption (and boost its utility as a payment method). The price chart analysis says the rally in BCH is here to say.  Bitcoin Cash chart  The above chart (prices as per Bitfinex) shows:  BCH has failed to hold above the 261.8 percent Fibonacci extension level of $2,327.11.  The decline from $2,425 (intra-day high) to $2,260 also indicates the first attempt to break above the rising channel hurdle ($2,327.11) has failed.  The 5-day MA and 10-day MA are curled up in favor of the bulls.  The relative strength index (RSI) shows overbought conditions, but is well short of the highs seen in November. Thus, there is enough room for BCH to extend the rally.  View  The area around the upward sloping 10-day MA level of $1,750 is likely to act as a strong support in the short-term.  A close (as per UTC) above $2,327.11 (261.8 percent Fibonacci extension and rising channel hurdle) would open up upside towards $3,000.  That said, the comments on social media show the investor community feels the rally in BCH could fall apart if bitcoin suffers a major setback. While that could be true, the BCH/BTC chart indicates bitcoin cash could still score gains against bitcoin.  BCH/BTC  The above chart shows:  A higher low pattern (BTC 0.068 on Dec. 8 and BTC 0.09 on Dec. 16).  The relative strength index (RSI) is above 50.00 (in the bullish territory), indicates the scope for further gains in BCH/BTC pair.  The 5-day MA and 10-day MA favor the bulls.  View  The pair seems to have bottomed out at BTC 0.068 (Dec. 8 low) and could test the falling channel hurdle of BTC 0.1454.  A close (as per UTC) above BTC 0.1454 would signal bullish falling channel breakout and could yield rally to BTC 0.2225 (Nov. 24 high).  On the downside, only a close below BTC 0.068 (Dec. 8 low) would abort the bullish view.

42380171,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MH2H,1513688438,Blockchain's 2018 Goal? Human Rights Over Financial Gains,"Thessy Mehrain is director of product and innovation at ConsenSys, where she works on dapps and protocols to enable social innovation via the ethereum blockchain. She is also the founder of ""Women in Blockchain"" New York, a distributed global network building diversity and inclusion.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review series.      2017 was an exciting year for blockchain.  Despite the fact that the world today is rife with discord and polarization, there are those who are passionate about building a better future, one where people are empowered to self-organize and the institutions that underpin society actually work for the people they serve.  That is why as we reach the end of the year, it is a good time to step back and review the progress we have made towards those goals. Blockchain enables a world in which every human being has their needs met and has a voice, an open world, where we can collaborate globally on what is meaningful to us and where we benefit from our diversity of experiences.  By shifting data ownership and control, once passive consumers can become active participants in society as a whole. Equipped with tools to audit supply chains, values like labor safety, fair trade, organic production and other values can be verified, replacing advertising jargon with proof, replacing trust with auditability.  Being involved in the blockchain space today feels like being part of something larger, grander, something with a socially valuable purpose. That is why blockchain meet-ups are overflowing, conferences are sold out and the difference between personal and professional interests, for many, are blurring.  Not just ambitious, these goals should serve as reminders that we HAVE to get this right.  In 2017, we saw:  The rise of new tokens and funds  The largest increase in the global blockchain participant pool we've seen to date  Valuation bubbles.  In 2018, we need to:  Educate new participants in the blockchain ecosystem  Work intentionally on diversity and a representative culture  Understand the opportunities as a matter of empowering human rights.  Attracting money and masses  In 2017, blockchain leapt into the public conscious by ways of forks, CryptoKitties and token launches, also referred to as ICOs. Driven by investment opportunities and media attention, traditional businesses and consumers started to take active interest in cryptocurrencies and their underlying blockchain technology.  But, we should remember this expanded participant pool joined primarily for financial gains, drawn in by newly generated tokens that have given buyers expectations of positive performance.  For those already involved, confidence in a blockchain future was validated and fueled by the high volume of crowdsourced funding. To date, an estimated $3.6 billion was raised for token projects created just on the ethereum blockchain, an amount that justified calling token launches themselves the platform's ""killer app.""  With it came a sense of a modern day gold rush, but also an expansion of what is possible.  Compared to the phases of the previous internet boom which rang in the information age, the age of blockchain, of direct, disintermediated value transfer and automation, just reached 1998-levels of interest. Just like then on the back of bubbles, the crypto world invited the mainstream to join.  Laying the groundwork  And the arrival of an Apple-spoiled consumer audience lacking the passion and patience to adjust to developer jargon and unusable workflows has also brought new product requirements.  To make it easier to onboard new customers, an emphasis emerged on simplifying complexities of blockchain-based applications with delightful user experiences, appealing designs and consumer friendly language. Everyone loves CryptoKitties, the tradeable and breedable representations of value.  They are denominated in ether and have been bringing the network almost to a halt, being the cutest motivators to scale transaction throughput and liquidity.  2017 also brought a focus on making blockchain workplaces more inviting.  How better to create a more inclusive and equitable society than with diverse creators? A notable PBS study demonstrated that diversity is instrumental to building better products and systems.  The smarter companies have already well established diversity efforts (ethnicity, cultural, age, orientation...), while Women in Blockchain meet-ups and Social Impact initiatives popped up across the globe, expanding the blockchain story with female narratives.  What's next? Opportunities in 2018  But with all this achieved, now what?  In 2018, we must:  Redirect already captured interest to create equality – Bubbles are signals of a market demand, and represent mostly expectations of monetary returns. Let's embrace them as opportunities for growth. But if we stop here, we might easily continue to centralize wealth, repeat traditional power structures, and miss the real opportunity.  Educate new participants about the value proposition of public blockchains – and reposition 'profit' to include monetary and social value.  Create a safe environment that supports innovation – Inevitably, some of the bubbles will burst, some of the milestones will be missed, and some of the projects will evaporate and investors will get burned, leading to calls for regulations. But if we regulate based on old structures and paradigms, we will stifle innovation.  Take responsibility to self-regulate – This includes expanding efforts like those of Consensys' ""Brooklyn Project,"" which has the mission of providing market participants and regulators with powerful tools to protect consumers and enhance the integrity of token-based networks.  Intentionally build diversity and inclusion in the creator space – We are early into the blockchain era and still struggling with figuring out the technology. That focus is one of the reasons why the creator space is so young, white male dominated. Even with the best intentions and demonstrated intelligence, this doesn't create an inviting environment for diverse people, needed to build robust global products.  Involve diverse communities in the creation of all blockchain products – education efforts to aggregate diverse intelligence and ensure that solutions serve everyone.  Enable the core promises of blockchain to empower human rights – We have experienced systematic failures in the globalization of society. Entire populations have been left behind in poverty, lacking education and basic services, without a voice to stand up for themselves, bereft of mobility and freedom, while the right of corporations has been expanded and been protected, often benefitting from the misery of the poor.  Promote and protect the right to freely exchange value between any two parties. The freedom to exchange is essential to participation in the future world. It is equivalent to the freedom of speech in the digital space. It is a matter of equality and has to be protected and considered as a human right.  For many, the initial draw towards the blockchain and crypto world might be financial gains.  But for a more just future, we must expand the definition of profit to include both monetary and social gains, and understand that blockchain alone is a technical solution that enables social innovation.  A diverse creator pool and innovation-friendly regulations are essential to building mechanisms in line with equality and human rights.  It is our responsibility and opportunity to get that right in 2018!  Not how you'd increase the crypto crowd? CoinDesk is looking for submissions to its 2017 in Review series.

42380175,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MH7J,1513684219,Bitcoin Risks Bearish Price Reversal as Altcoins Surge,"Bitcoin prices are feeling the pull of gravity today, amid solid gains across many alternative cryptocurrencies.  Having soared to new record highs around $20,000 over the weekend, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has since dropped to sub-$18,000 levels.  Bitcoin (BTC) has depreciated by 5.3 percent in today's session, and was last seen changing hands at $17,4500 levels, as per CoinDesks's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  Meanwhile, ether (ETH) and bitcoin cash (BCH) have both hit new all-time highs today (as per CoinMarketCap), having gained 16.6 percent and 26.6 percent, respectively, in the last 24 hours.  With the cryptocurrency market as a whole now worth over $630 billion, the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization are up at least 6 percent on the day.  A detailed look at the individual markets suggests that the money could be flowing out of bitcoin and into rival cryptocurrencies. For instance, the strong rally in bitcoin cash is backed by a surge in volumes on exchanges offering BCH/BTC pairs.  This rotation of money out of bitcoin and into alternative currencies is largely in line with the bullish cross cryptocurrency charts (BCH/BTC, XRP/BTC, LTC/BTC) discussed last Friday.  That said, the downside in BTC could be limited, as most major alternative currencies have clocked new lifetime highs in the last 24 hours, and it's possible that investors may take their profits in alternative currencies and channel part of that new money back into bitcoin.  Even so, the price chart analysis calls for a quick progression in prices, or bulls risk losing control.  Bitcoin chart  The above chart (prices as per Coinbase) shows:  ""Hanging man"" candle – a bearish reversal candlestick chart pattern that occurs at the top of an uptrend. A weak close (as per UTC) below $18,200 (yesterday's low) would confirm a bearish reversal.  Increased risk of a bearish price-relative strength index (RSI) divergence, as suggested by higher highs in price and lower highs on the RSI. A weak close today would confirm the bearish RSI divergence.  The 5-day MA and 10-day MA are curled up in favor of the bulls.  Rising trendline support is seen at $17,500.  View  BTC looks set to test the rising trendline support of $17,500 in the next 12 hours. However, the support might hold, since the dips below the upward sloping 10-day MA ($17,756) are likely to be short-lived. Furthermore, a pullback in alternative currencies could take the pressure off bitcoin.  However, a close (as per UTC) below $17,500 would add confirm the bearish hanging-man reversal and bearish RSI divergence. As history shows, bitcoin has suffered major corrections following confirmation of the bearish RSI divergence.  Hence, a close below $17,500 could potentially yield a decline to $13,500 (Dec. 12 low).  On the other hand, a move above the 5-day MA ($18,822) in the next few hours could put a return to $20,000 back on the table.

As reported by state broadcaster DR, Danmarks Nationalbank director Lars Rohde argued that bitcoin is ""dangerous"" and, likening bitcoin investment to gambling , he said: ""If you do not like casinos, you've got a good alternative.""  Rohde continued:  ""I see bitcoin like tulip mania, like a bubble out of control.""  On a concluding note, the director added that the bitcoin market is ""completely unregulated"" and, thus, no protection is provided by the authorities. ""It is the responsibility of the individual"" and investors ""should not come complaining to us if it goes wrong,"" he said.  Rohde's statements follow soon after an analysis from the central bank (published Dec. 15) stated that introducing a central bank-issued digital currency in the country would not result in better payment solutions and may also bring risks of financial instability.  ""In a Danish context, it is unclear what central bank digital currency would be able to contribute that is not already covered by the current payment solutions,"" the analysis states.  Back in 2014, Danmarks Nationalbank compared bitcoin to ""glass beads"" – an apparent reference to the beads that were traded in past centuries for gold, ivory and other commodities. It stated that bitcoin is not money in the true sense of the word, as it is not backed by an issuing institution.

42380163,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MGsD,1513674010,The Next Step In Overstock's Master Blockchain Plan Is Underway,"""There's a method in our madness.""  That's how Overstock founder Patrick Byrne describes the often unexpected moves that have come to characterize his efforts to rethink Wall Street with blockchain. And what began in the lab as far back as 2014, took yet another step yesterday when the firm announced (not without a few hiccups) that its initial coin offering (ICO) for subsidiary tZERO had commenced.  First revealed in October, the company is currently seeking to raise $250 million through a pre-sale for ""strategic purchasers"" ending Jan. 18. A subsequent sale period may run through Feb. 18. Either sale period may be changed at any time by the company, and both are limited to accredited investors.  But for Byrne and Overstock, this is just one piece of an expanding puzzle.  Last week, for example, Byrne dropped another bombshell, revealing he's weighing whether to sell the e-commerce business that helped him make his name. The reason? He wants to devote more of his limited time to a new blockchain property registry system.  And while that might sound abrupt (or even alarming) to potential purchasers, Byrne quickly soothed worries, adding all his recent efforts fit together.  ""We've been designing this tech stack for three years,"" he said.  Speaking at CoinDesk's New York headquarters, Byrne explained how he's partnering with Peruvian economist and ""The Mystery of Capital"" author Hernando de Soto to launch a new Overstock subsidiary, called De Soto Inc., that he believes will be compatible with the token sale it will carry out for tZERO.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, tZERO is an SEC-regulated alternative trading system (ATS) – also known on Wall Street as a ""dark pool."" As De Soto Inc. unlocks capital in the developing world, tZERO will be able to serve it as a capital market, at scale. Since each venture will have blockchain technology at their core, there will be a natural symbiosis, according to Byrne.  On his new moves, Byrne said:  ""I feel an ethical obligation toward re-orienting my life so it's about getting this done. We think we've got five years and 5 billion people we can change the world for.""  Following the token  Yet, Byrne and de Soto's long-term vision will need to follow the tZERO sale.  Byrne said that the interest in the offering, expected to be one of the largest-ever in the industry, has been intense, remarking: ""We know we're sort of hyper-oversubscribed.""  Notably, Overstock has not disclosed the percentage of its token pool on offering, price per token nor the discount available to participants in the offering.  That said, non-institutional purchases shouldn't fear that big investors will get the entire sale in the first round. ""That's not Patrick at all,"" Steven Nerayoff, CEO of Alchemist, a blockchain consulting company and official advisor to the tZERO sale told CoinDesk. ""Patrick could sell this out in a very quick fashion through institutions, but that was not his desire.""  Nerayoff promised a sizable public sale, following the presale.  While providing an equity stake in tZERO, the token will also be used to pay the fees associated with all the different kinds of trades on the exchange, including its digital locate receipts, which Byrne believes will make what he calls market ""mischief,"" such as naked short selling, impossible.  This brings the conversation back to one of Byrne's favorites, the shortcomings of Wall Street offerings.  ""The conventional market has split trading and settlement, and in that split, there are opportunities for lots of mischief. On the blockchain, you reunite the trade with the settlement, and all that opportunity goes away,"" Byrne explained.  Closing the opportunities for market manipulation, Byrne argued, shuts down some of the most lucrative investment rights in the prime brokerage divisions of major investment banks.  ""It's a blockchain system that's an arrow, it's a dagger, right at the heart of prime brokerage revenue,"" he said.  Tradeable property  And in parallel with his dreams of disrupting the current financial system, Byrne wants to bolster people's individual wealth in the developing world.  To do this, Byrne and de Soto are looking to establish tradeable property titles in regions where those haven't been available, so individuals can then trade the capital that creates on tZERO.  ""If you can get this right, it would release so much capital into the world,"" Byrne said, pointing to estimates from Overstock that there are $14 trillion in ""dead capital"" globally.  Indeed, Byrne makes the idea seem so simple, you might wonder why it hasn't been done before. But according to de Soto, the West just doesn't understand the developing world. De Soto explained it's not that property in the developing world isn't titled, it's just that those titles aren't in traditional formats banks can work with.  De Soto and his collaborators have developed the expertise to locate those titles and move those to a blockchain so that financial institutions can work with them.  Based on that, those property owners will then be able to borrow money using their property as collateral, which could allow those individuals to start businesses or otherwise grow their wealth.  De Soto said:  ""We start off with land … but it's about all assets.""  The timeline  Ultimately, though, this will rest on the ultimate use of tZERO by the global markets, though Byrne believes a limited set of options will allow it to easily gain marketshare.  ""We have the only SEC compliant ATS in the world that can trade blockchain instruments,"" Byrne said.  Property titles from one country will start being added to the blockchain between March and April, in an effort to show how the system will work. While neither de Soto nor Byrne would specify which country was to be added first, de Soto said, ""It won't be any old place,"" hinting at a country where property titles are a particularly messy system today.  The system will roll out globally shortly thereafter, said Byrne.  While blockchain-based land registry initiatives have been piloted before, they have all happened in places that want to make already functional title systems more efficient, such as Britain and Sweden.  In this way, de Soto said about the new project:  ""It's not disruptive. It's foundational.""  CoinDesk is following this developing story.

42380160,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MGoR,1513666814,"Bitcoin Likely to Become 'Niche' Product, Says ING's Top Economist","The chief economist for Dutch banking giant ING believes bitcoin will likely wind up as a niche financial product, according to a new report.  In a report from Dec. 18, ING's principal economist Teunis Brosens argued that actual use of the cryptocurrency will be limited to ""tech nerds, people obsessed about their privacy, [and] people afraid of (hyper) inflation of traditional currencies,"" among others.  ""In the long term, bitcoin has little to offer to a wider audience, and will likely return to being a niche product for a select group of enthusiasts,"" he wrote.  Bronsens' opinion is perhaps at odds with other pronouncements about bitcoin in recent days, which has seen its price trade in excess of $18,000 amid the launch of derivatives contracts on regulated exchanges in the U.S.  Indeed, he argued that some of bitcoin's characteristics that are often cited as strengths – the lack of a central intermediary, for example – would keep it out of arm's reach from a more mainstream audience. He also posited that the price volatility around bitcoin makes it a poor method of payment for most consumers.  ""For bitcoin to function as a means of payment, it needs to be stable. A world in which your money buys you a large latte today, but only a small espresso tomorrow, is hardly convenient,"" he wrote.  While the economist's commentary mostly focused on bitcoin, he also extended his criticism to cryptocurrencies in general, arguing that one of their core features – being open source – is also ill-suited for mass-market use.  ""While cryptocurrencies do compete with each other for users, and can create value for their users by providing an extensive network of other users, they are not able to create unique value for their users by being a distinctive platform with special features not found elsewhere,"" Brosens wrote in the report.  While casting a critical eye on bitcoin, Bronsens struck a largely positive note about blockchain, writing:  ""Blockchain is an impressive technology that may bring progress to a variety of fields, ranging from finance to health care, and from notary to voting.

42380167,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MGxF,1513648856,2018 for ICOs: A Quarter-By-Quarter Outlook,"Emma Channing is the CEO and general counsel of the Satis Group, an investment group focused on blockchain and digital finance.    The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review.      As specialists in the ICO market, we assist our clients in optimizing the execution of their ICOs, and understanding the constantly shifting state of crypto capital markets is no small part of that exercise.  Looking back, 2017 was wild ride, with huge contrasts between some predictable developments (such as the move towards ATS exchanges and security tokens) and less predictable patches (resulting from deal fatigue and forks). It must be said that although certainty in any market is impossible, the ever-changing world of crypto creates unique challenges for forecasting.  Successfully running ICOs this year involved constantly trimming sails and adjusting to rapidly changing market expectations. ICOs being a very young capital market, I don't see next year being any different.  I am however bullish about the ICO market long term as a funding mechanism for emerging growth companies akin to the role of high-yield debt for public companies, and that's the direction we have focused on (it's not an accident that the offering memorandums for BCAP, Science, and Protos resemble that of a high-yield debt instrument).  Contrary to many in the ICO world, I do continue to see an active and important role for venture capital and incubator firms for seed and early rounds. Early-stage companies benefit from the guidance and connections provided, which balances the relative cost startups pay for the investment.  However, I do suspect that we will see ICOs take the place of Series B and Series C rounds onwards. I think the days of the late-stage VCs are numbered, or at the very least the number that are highly successful is likely to dwindle. The ICO market is here to stay, with the more relevant question being what is likely to sell, as each quarter of this year has been distinctly different, with rapidly shifting appetites and economic drivers.  At a high level these are my thoughts for 2018:  Q1  Although November 2017 did see an all-time monthly high of $743 million for ICOs, this funding was highly concentrated to specific deals and the overall extraordinary volume of deals in the market made it difficult for high-quality deals to stand out compared to previous quarters. As a result, per-deal data weakened slightly as the number of ICOs in the month increased ~50% over the month prior.  I think we will continue to see this trend continue into Q1 2018 – the overall market is likely to remain challenging as the volume glut works itself out.  Volatility in bitcoin, which we tend to see at the start of the year for a variety of factors including what has become an annual trend for people in the People's Republic of China to sell down ahead of the world's largest human migration, the Chinese New Year holiday, will also be a consideration.  We do also expect the current ferocious pace of investigative activities by Canadian and U.S. securities regulators to continue; this isn't getting a lot of press to date, but has been extensive.  We also expect there to be one or more significant U.S. enforcement cases, including potentially one or more of the cryptocurrency exchanges before the end of 2017 or at least by the end of 2018. Again, that is likely to have a chilling effect on the volume of the market, albeit one I think is long overdue.  I remain stunned that the SEC report on the DAO seems to have had absolutely no impact on the pace of ICOs, nor on the structure in which many have been run during 2017.  It was a wonderful piece of very detailed guidance on the views of the SEC. Other than their position on app and utility tokens trading on the exchanges, I am very surprised that more ICOs have not incorporated this guidance into their ICO process and documents. I believe this has change in the near term and the reaction will be swift following any high-profile enforcements.  Q2  For Q2, I think the two big questions will be the price of BTC and ETH and whether any alternative trading systems (ATS) will be up and running and trading security tokens.  BTC is continuing to climb at a ferocious pace, and I don’t think it is too much of a stretch to say that BTC is likely to hit $50,000 at some point during the middle of next year, although where ETH, or BCH for that matter, will be is anyone's guess.  A high BTC price can be both a driver and a dampener on ICO activity; people feel the need to diversify and feel buoyant and positive about purchasing ICOs, but at the same time, expect ICOs to be providing the same ""return"" that BTC is. This creates an opportunity cost problem with BTC, when it more than doubles in value in a single quarter as it has in Q4 2017.  There are additional impacts that good ICO advisors have to respond to quickly, for example, a high BTC price forces ICOs to make concessions such as pricing in US dollars at the close of an ICO or at the close of any private or discounted sale. A high BTC price also encourages app and utility token ICOs to strain at what are viewed as the current securities law guardrails, resulting in what I suspect will be yet another active quarter for enforcement.  Security tokens are an ideal solution to the issues of a high BTC price and a strong enforcement environment, as they can legally promise a return and can genuinely offer a diversification from BTC and ETH. We are bullish that security tokens will eventually form the majority of the high-quality issuance volume within the ICO market. The key of course is trading them and that requires an ATS or for the security token to be registered with the SEC on an S1 or a Form A+ and to be trading on a nationally recognized exchange like NASDAQ or NYSE.  The challenge to date is to get an ATS with a specific license able to trade digital securities – and we see several lining up to be available in Q1 or at the latest Q2.  I do also remain bullish that Regulation A+ is an ideal match for ICOs, particularly it’s relatively low access threshold for investors (the greater of 10 percent of net worth or income, self-certified) compared to the accredited investor certification necessary for Regulation D/506 offerings.  However, because 26 U.S. Code § 1032 only recognizes a capital raise strictly through a stock sale, ICOs proceeds of US issuer have to be taxed as revenue, and unless there’s operating costs or net operating losses to offset that makes the raise incredibly expensive when you add on the high cost of legal and other specialist advice or an ICO versus a conventional raise.  Q3  Now we really are at the point of crystal ball gazing. Generally speaking by this point we expect several ATS licensed to trade security tokens to be up and running in the U.S., and we expect the smart holders of BTC and ETH to pivot a significant part of their portfolio to security tokens.  Again, what we are anticipating by this time is a global regulatory response which will underline issuer and investor decision-making.  Laugh as you may, but we do expect the Burning Man festival to yet again have a significant slowdown impact for August: the digital token and cryptocurrency market has not historically had the traditional ECM blackouts, but it does have a few specific ones and Burning Man is probably the most significant because so many market participants attend.  Q4  Frankly, Q4 is anyone's guess.  Think you have a better idea? CoinDesk is looking for submissions to its 2017 in Review series.
