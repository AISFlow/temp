32771015,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=637531,1724452235,Tron-Based SUN Token Skyrockets 197% As SunPump’s Momentum Continues,"The memecoin frenzy has reached the Tron Network after the launch of Pump.fun’s rival, SunPum. The new memecoin deployer has been making the headlines after surpassing its Solana-based counterpart on key metrics this week. The platform’s remarkable performance in the past two weeks has propelled the network, TRX, and the SUN ecosystem. As a result, SUN, the native token of the DeFi protocol behind SunPump, has surged over 190% in the last seven days. Related Reading: Trump-Inspired Memecoins Soar 40% Amid Rumors Of Endorsement By RFK Jr. SunPump Takes The Market By Storm Nearly two weeks ago, DeFi protocol SUN.io introduced SunPump, a Tron-based memecoin launcher to rival Solana’s Pump.fun. The project, which has been heavily promoted by Tron’s founder Justin Sun, became the first memecoin deployer in the blockchain. Presented as a “convenient and cost-effective token issuance solution,” the deployer has gained significant popularity in the past week. The crypto community was first skeptical about the project, claiming it likely marked “the end of the memecoin era.” However, its recent performance has brought new life to the Tron network, significantly boosting activity. Dune Analytics data shows that SunPump has deployed over 33,330 memecoins since its creation, generating over 13.1 million TRX, worth around $2 million, in revenue. On Wednesday, the platform reached an all-time high (ATH) on key metrics, surpassing its Solana counterpart in issued tokens and daily fees. SunPump made $585,000 in revenue on that day from creating 7,531 tokens, while Pump.fun launched 6,701 and generated $366,000 in fees. Tron-Based Tokens See Massive Surge Some investors have capitalized on the new memecoin frenzy with some of the most popular tokens launched in the blockchain. A week ago, two animal-themed tokens saw increases of over 50,000% and 25,000% after launching. At the time, SUNDOG reached a market capitalization of $60 million, which granted it to be listed on crypto exchanges Poloniex and HTX. Since then, the dog-themed token has reached a market cap of $322 million, currently at $190 million. As of this writing, SUNDOG is trading at $0.1918, a 260% price increase in the last seven days. Similarly, SUN, the native token of SUN.io, is among the largest winners of the week, with a 197% surge propelled by the network’s momentum. SUN was originally launched in 2021 and reached an ATH of $66 before crashing due to supply hyperinflation. Since then, the token has been redenominated as a multifunctional governance token on the SUN platform. Last week, SunPump revealed that 100% of the protocol’s revenue would be used to buy back and burn SUN tokens to “support the sustainable development of the SUN ecosystem.” Related Reading: Investors Buying Bitcoin (BTC) Over Ethereum (ETH): Key Data Reveals Moreover, Binance Futures announced on Thursday the launch of the SUNUSDT Perpetual Contract with up to 75x leverage. This week, the bullish push has made SUN’s price break out of a multi-year consolidation range. After moving sideways within the $0.003-$0.01 price range for the past four years, SUN broke above the $0.15 resistance level on Tuesday. Since then, the token has continued its bullish rally with a 30.4% increase in the last 24 hours. As of this writing, SUN is trading at $0.031 with a market capitalization of $301 million.

32769374,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=637498,1724446854,Bitcoin Poised for a 200% Rally as Analyst Spot Rare Bullish Pattern,"Amid Bitcoin’s current gradual recovery in price, attention has been drawn towards the asset as it prepares to be on the verge of closing its seventh consecutive monthly candle above the all-time high (ATH) of 2021. Renowned crypto analyst Moustache recently took to X to highlight this key milestone, emphasizing the importance of higher timeframes in trading. According to Moustache, the fact that Bitcoin is holding above its previous ATH every month is a strong indicator of support, which could signal continued upward momentum shortly. Related Reading: Top Economist Predicts Bitcoin Price Top Before Worst Recession Since 1929 Is Bitcoin Building Momentum For A Big Move? Mustache’s analysis noted, “Can everyone see what’s happening here? BTC is about to close its SEVENTH monthly candle above the ATH of 2021. The higher the timeframe, the stronger the support. That’s bullish [to be honest].” This statement highlights the significance of long-term support levels in his BTC outlook. Notably, in trading, when an asset consistently closes above a previous peak on higher timeframes, it often indicates that the market is forming a solid foundation for future growth. This observation is particularly relevant for Bitcoin, which has historically exhibited strong price movements following extended periods of consolidation and support-building. While Bitcoin’s sustained support above its previous ATH is a positive sign, another technical indicator also highlighted by the same analysts: the Bollinger Band Width Percentile (BBWP). BBWP Indicator Signals 200% Rally Ahead In a recent post, Moustache pointed out that the BBWP on Bitcoin’s 2-week (2W) chart signals the emergence of blue bars, a rare occurrence only seen once in Bitcoin’s history. The BBWP is a tool used in technical analysis to measure the width of the Bollinger Bands, which are volatility indicators that reflect the range of an asset’s price movement. The blue bars in the BBWP indicate a period of low volatility, which often precedes significant price swings. Moustache explained the implications of this signal, disclosing that the last time the BBWP signaled multiple blue bars on the 2W-Chart of BTC, BTC saw almost a 200% upward move. “Incidentally, this is only the second time we’ve seen blue bars in the BBWP. This has never happened before in history,” Moustache noted. This observation suggests that Bitcoin could be on the cusp of a major price movement, with the potential for significant gains if the historical pattern holds. Related Reading: Bitcoin And NASDAQ Show Tight Correlation: What Does This Mean For BTC? Notably, the BBWP’s indication of low volatility aligns with the concept that markets often experience a surge in price action following periods of calm. In Bitcoin’s case, the current environment of subdued volatility, as indicated by the blue bars, may be setting the stage for a significant price breakout.

42417335,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYBzh,1724441821,"Crypto Friendly RFK Jr. Drops White House Hunt, Will Lend Kennedy Name to Trump","Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has suspended his presidential campaign and will pull his name from the ballots in 10 battleground states.  Kennedy said he's joining the campaign and potential second administration of Trump, with whom he said he hopes to work on a number of issues that have been central to RFK Jr.'s public life.  Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has suspended his independent pursuit of the U.S. presidency and encouraged his supporters to instead back former President Donald Trump in battleground states, putting the weight of the Kennedy name behind the GOP candidate.  Though Kennedy's family has a deep legacy as Democratic royalty, the son of 1960s politician icon Robert F. Kennedy and nephew of former President John F. Kennedy said he's pulling his name from ballots in 10 ""battleground"" states so his campaign doesn't jeopardize the chances for Trump.  ""I no longer believe that I have a realistic path to electoral victory in the face of this relentless, systematic censorship and media control,"" RFK Jr. said Friday at a press event in Arizona. ""Our polling consistently showed by staying on the ballot in the battleground states, I would likely hand the election over to the Democrats with whom I disagree on existential issues.""  In a Trump win, Kennedy said he'd join the administration of the former president, who benefited from a 2% bump in Polymarket election betting as RFK Jr. spoke, climbing to a 51% chance of a win against Harris' 48%.  Already higher for the session after U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell Friday morning indicated interest rates are headed lower in September, bitcoin {{BTC}} rose further, trading at $63,700 at press time, up 5% over the past 24 hours.  While RFK Jr. bears the outsized Kennedy name, he hadn't been embraced as the standard bearer by others in the Kennedy clan, many of whom endorsed President Joe Biden in April, before Biden handed the Democratic nomination baton to Vice President Kamala Harris. RFK's candidacy had widely been seen as more damaging to Trump than Harris, though it's unclear how many supporters he'll bring to bear for the Republican nominee.  And from a crypto-sector perspective, RFK doesn't have to sell Trump on joining his embrace of the industry, because the former president is way ahead on that.  Even as Kennedy is putting his weight behind Trump, the former president this week shifted his attention from the campaign to promote a new family business in crypto: a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform they're calling ""The Defiant Ones,"" though further details remain scant. While Trump had long been a crypto skeptic, he began making millions on the release of branded non-fungible tokens (NFTs) after he lost the White House and has more recently come out as a digital assets booster.  Kennedy's new absence on the ballot in Arizona and elsewhere generally turns the November election into a straight-up choice between the two major parties' candidates, though he said he'll remain on the ballot outside the battleground and still hopes to get votes. So far, national polling suggests Harris may be retaining a slight edge over Trump, though the advantage is slim.  Meanwhile, Harris's views on crypto remain unknown. Her campaign hasn't revealed any major policy positions, though an aide this week said Harris will ""support policies that ensure that emerging technologies and that sort of industry can continue to grow,"" and he acknowledged the industry has been asking for rules of the road.  Kennedy said throwing his support to Trump was a ""heart-wrenching"" decision based on their alignment on several issues, including the war in Ukraine, child health issues and constraints on free speech. RFK Jr. will now join Trump's campaign.  ""I have the certainty that this is what I'm meant to do, and that certainty gives me internal peace,"" he said.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/08/23/crypto-friendly-rfk-jr-drops-white-house-hunt-will-lend-kennedy-name-to-trump,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9effe9fa3a7c608ac9e57e5d545f5a0973cf1397-3000x2001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Despite the welcomed recovery, Bitcoin bulls are yet to build on the momentum and break above the local resistance levels. Even so, traders are optimistic, expecting buyers to take charge and resume the uptrend set in motion in Q1 2024. In their forecasts, more analysts think any breakout above $72,000 and July highs could spark a wave of demand that may see Bitcoin record fresh all-time highs above $73,800. Bitcoin Breaking To All-Time Highs Will Take Time Taking to X, one trader, pointing to Bitcoin’s historical price cycles, is convinced that there are two more phases to go before the coin breaks an all-time high and registers fresh all-time highs. In the past, all cycles tops–from the RSI Bollinger Band % Phases indicator, the analyst continued, tend to print out on the fifth move. So far, only three of these five cycles have been completed. Related Reading: Algorand Achieves New Record With 2 Billion Transactions, ALGO Price Jumps 14% Judging from the current state of price action, another analyst, commenting on this preview believes Bitcoin bulls may not have the momentum to break above $73,800 and sustain this level on the first attempt. Instead, in the next two months or so, between September and October, the all-time high will be conquered. However, these gains will be extended with the coin printing new all-time highs in early January 2025. This forecast will align with the Bitcoin historical 4-year cycle. Will Bitcoin Find Favor In Q4 2024? As traders chip in, making predictions, another analyst, pointing to price data, notes that it has been 162 days since Bitcoin broke November 2021 highs and printed fresh all-time highs. The previous cycle only required 209 and 188 days to print fresh all-time highs. Now that history favors Bitcoin in every last cycle of the year, the analyst expects prices to expand rapidly in the last three months. Related Reading: Cardano Price Poised To Hit $2.88, Following Solana’s Fractal: Crypto Analyst As of August 23, bulls are back in the equation, according to the Bitcoin bull-bear market cycle indicator. After fluctuating since early August, the signal is back to blue, pointing to interest, a net positive. Overall, Bitcoin remains within a narrow range. Bulls must decisively push prices higher, reversing all losses of early August. However, any drop below $50,000 would trigger a sell-off to new H2 2024 lows.

32766012,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=637416,1724436039,Cardano Investors React To 14% ADA Price Surge To $0.37,"On-chain data has provided insights into how Cardano (ADA) investors will likely react to the crypto token’s recent price surge. Cardano has been one of the leading gainers in the crypto market in the last seven days, with a price gain of over 14% during this period. Related Reading: Cardano Chang Upgrade Launch: ADA Sees 52% Explosion In Major Metric Cardano Could Face Significant Selling Pressure Cardano could face significant selling pressure from investors who recently entered the money following the crypto token’s price surge. Data from the on-chain analytics platform Santiment shows that over an additional 12% of Cardano’s supply is now in profits, which could pave the way for the holders of these tokens to secure their profits, especially considering Cardano’s unstable price action so far in this market cycle. Despite its recent price gains, Cardano has been one of the most underperforming coins since the start of the year and boasts a year-to-date (YTD) loss of over 35%. As such, Cardano holders are likely to be more compelled to secure their profits rather than hold on to the belief that this recent price surge is a bullish reversal rather than a relief bounce. The recent transaction pattern among these Cardano holders also suggests that they are losing confidence in the crypto token and are likely to secure their profits as soon as possible. Data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock shows that the average holding time of coins transacted in the last thirty days has been 5 months, indicating that Cardano holders are paper-handing their tokens. Meanwhile, further data from IntoTheBlock shows how many addresses could offload their tokens if these Cardano holders begin to secure profits. 481,370 ADA addresses bought the crypto token between the price range of $0.3 and $0.35. This set of investors could be the first to begin securing profits, considering that they could easily fall out of the money if Cardano’s recent price surge is simply a relief bounce. A Guide For ADA Investors Crypto analyst Trend Rider recently provided a guide for Cardano holders, which he stated they could use as a “master plan to stay calm and tune out the noise.” This guide came in the form of a chart that showed key levels holders should watch out for and use in making a well-thought-out investment decision. The analyst stated that the range between $0.22 and $0.31 is a liquidation zone, which presents a strong buying area for those who want to add to their positions. He further stated that the main barrier zone for Cardano is between $0.42 and $0.55, noting that this area is ideal for taking profits. He added that Cardano could enjoy a quick rally to $0.75 if it breaks above this main barrier zone. The analyst claimed $0.75 is the “final boss resistance, a prime spot to take profits.”Those with greater conviction in Cardano might want to hold the crypto token for much longer if it hits $0.75. Trend Rider stated that a break above $0.75 means the crypto token is entering bull market territory. At the time of writing, ADA has been trading at around $0.379, which is up almost 4% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

32765875,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=637530,1724435688,Build Your Wealth With Husky Inu And Mpeppe Both Positioned To 1000x In The Coming Months,"You have probably been closely following the journey of Pepe Unchained (PEPU), which recently wrapped up its ICO after raising an impressive $10 million in just two months. This success story has made headlines, particularly as Pepe Unchained promises to revolutionize the meme coin space with its own Layer 2 blockchain. However, with the ICO now completed, investors are turning their attention to a new contender in the market Mpeppe (MPEPE), a token that’s garnering attention for its potential 100x returns. Pepe Unchained (PEPU): A Milestone in Meme Coins Pepe Unchained (PEPU) has been a significant player in the recent meme coin boom. The project’s success can be attributed to its unique approach of combining the fun and engaging aspects of meme coins with advanced blockchain technology. By developing its own Layer 2 solution, Pepe Unchained has addressed some of the common issues plaguing Ethereum-based meme coins, such as high transaction fees and slow processing times. The project’s Layer 2 blockchain is expected to go live soon, bringing with it lower costs and faster transactions, making it easier and more efficient for investors to trade and stake their tokens. This development has positioned Pepe Unchained (PEPU) as a serious contender in the meme coin market, beyond the usual hype-driven cycles. Why Investors Are Eyeing Mpeppe (MPEPE) Next While Pepe Unchained (PEPU) has been the talk of the town, savvy investors are already looking at what’s next. Mpeppe (MPEPE) is quickly becoming the focus of attention due to its promising potential. Currently priced at just 0.001777, MPEPE is in its presale stage and has already raised over $1.2 million, indicating strong investor interest. What makes Mpeppe stand out is its strategic positioning within the meme coin space. With a total supply of 7.6 billion tokens, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is designed to capture the interest of both seasoned investors and newcomers alike. The presale has already seen substantial progress, with over 77% of tokens sold. As Mpeppe (MPEPE) gears up for its next stage, where the price will increase to 0.0021, early investors are poised to see significant returns. The Appeal of Mpeppe’s Presale Bonuses One of the key attractions of Mpeppe (MPEPE) is the generous bonus structure for early investors. By using the promo code MPEPE20, investors can receive an additional 20% bonus on their token purchases. This incentive, combined with the low entry price, makes Mpeppe (MPEPE) a highly attractive option for those looking to maximize their gains in the volatile crypto market. Furthermore, Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s compatibility with the Ethereum blockchain ensures that it can easily integrate with a wide range of wallets and decentralized applications (dApps), providing seamless user experience and accessibility. The Future of Meme Coins: Mpeppe’s Potential for 100x Returns The success of meme coins like Pepe Unchained (PEPU) and the buzz around Mpeppe (MPEPE) highlight the continued appeal of this unique segment of the cryptocurrency market. Meme coins have shown time and again that they can generate significant returns, often exceeding expectations. Mpeppe, with its strong presale performance and innovative approach, is well-positioned to be the next big winner in this space. As investors move from the successful Pepe Unchained (PEPU) ICO, many are betting that Mpeppe will deliver the 100x returns they’re looking for. With its strategic bonus offerings, low entry price, and growing community support, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is quickly becoming the go-to option for those looking to capitalize on the next wave of meme coin success. In conclusion, while Pepe Unchained has set a high bar, Mpeppe is showing all the signs of being the next big thing in the meme coin world. For investors who missed out on Pepe Unchained (PEPU) or are looking to diversify, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers an exciting opportunity to ride the wave of meme coin profitability into 2024 and beyond.

32765829,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=637528,1724435449,Husky Inu Holders Put The Rivalry Aside And Purchase Mpeppe To Maximize Their Returns,"In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, rivalries are as common as the next big token launch. However, in an unexpected turn of events, Husky Inu (HINU) holders are putting aside the competitive spirit that often drives the meme coin market. Instead of sticking exclusively to their canine-themed investment, many have started diversifying their portfolios by purchasing Mpeppe (MPEPE), a move that is as strategic as it is surprising. Let’s delve into why these investors are choosing collaboration over competition to maximize their returns. The Rise of Husky Inu: A Tale of Success Husky Inu (HINU) burst onto the crypto scene as a formidable contender in the meme coin market. Built on the Solana blockchain, it quickly became a favorite among investors looking for the next big opportunity after Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. Husky Inu’s presale success, raising over $368,000 in just a few weeks, signaled the beginning of a promising journey. Husky Inu’s appeal lies in its unique features, such as a deflationary mechanism that continuously reduces the circulating supply, and a capped token supply of 100 billion. These features are designed to increase the token’s value over time, making it an attractive investment. Additionally, its charity voting mechanism and commitment to fast, low-cost transactions on the Solana blockchain have further solidified its place in the market. Enter Mpeppe: The New Contender on the Block While Husky Inu (HINU) was busy establishing its dominance, Mpeppe (MPEPE) quietly entered the scene, ready to take the meme coin world by storm. Unlike Husky Inu (HINU), Mpeppe is an ERC20 token on the Ethereum blockchain, which gives it a different kind of appeal, especially for those already invested in Ethereum’s vast ecosystem. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s presale has been nothing short of spectacular, with over $1.2 million raised and a significant portion of its tokens already sold. What makes Mpeppe (MPEPE) particularly attractive is its current price of 0.001777, offering a low entry point for investors who are looking to maximize their gains. The presale has been structured with strategic bonuses, including a 20% bonus for early investors, further incentivizing participation. Why Husky Inu Holders Are Diversifying with Mpeppe (MPEPE) At first glance, it might seem counterintuitive for Husky Inu (HINU) holders to invest in what could be considered a rival token. However, the savvy investors behind Husky Inu (HINU) recognize the value of diversification, especially in a market as volatile as cryptocurrency. By adding Mpeppe (MPEPE) to their portfolios, they are hedging their bets and positioning themselves to benefit from multiple success stories. Strategic Diversification: The crypto market is unpredictable, and even the most promising projects can experience setbacks. By investing in both Husky Inu (HINU) and Mpeppe (MPEPE), holders are spreading their risk across two different tokens with unique value propositions. This strategy allows them to capitalize on the growth of both projects, regardless of which one performs better in the short term. Maximizing Potential Returns: Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s presale price offers a tantalizing opportunity for significant returns. Given its low entry point and the potential for rapid appreciation once it hits the broader market, Mpeppe (MPEPE) presents an opportunity that Husky Inu (HINU) holders find too good to pass up. Leveraging Different Blockchains: Husky Inu (HINU) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) operate on different blockchains—Solana and Ethereum, respectively. This difference allows investors to tap into the strengths of both ecosystems. Solana’s speed and low transaction costs complement Ethereum’s established infrastructure and broad user base, giving investors the best of both worlds. Collaboration Over Competition: A New Era for Meme Coins? The decision by Husky Inu (HINU) holders to invest in Mpeppe (MPEPE) could signal a shift in how meme coin communities interact. Instead of viewing each other purely as competitors, there is a growing recognition that collaboration and diversification can lead to greater overall success. This approach could pave the way for a more integrated and cooperative meme coin market, where different tokens support each other’s growth rather than simply battling for dominance. Looking Ahead: What This Means for Investors For those holding Husky Inu (HINU), the move to diversify into Mpeppe (MPEPE) is a strategic one that reflects a deep understanding of the crypto market’s dynamics. By embracing both tokens, these investors are not only protecting themselves against potential downsides but also setting themselves up for potentially massive gains. As Mpeppe (MPEPE) continues its presale and Husky Inu (HINU) advances on its roadmap, the decision to hold both tokens could prove to be one of the smartest moves in the coming months. For those looking to maximize their returns, following the lead of these Husky Inu (HINU) holders might just be the key to unlocking substantial wealth in the near future. Conclusion The world of meme coins is evolving, and with it, the strategies of savvy investors. By putting aside traditional rivalries and embracing diversification, Husky Inu (HINU) holders are positioning themselves for success in a market that rewards both innovation and collaboration. Mpeppe’s (MPEPE) rise is just beginning, and those who join the movement early may find themselves reaping the rewards alongside their Husky Inu (HINU) counterparts.

32765740,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=637526,1724435156,Prices Moves: Dogecoin and Rival Cryptocurrency Mpeppe Current Upward Trend,"The cryptocurrency market has always been a rollercoaster of price movements and trends, and lately, two meme coins have been catching the attention of both investors and analysts: Dogecoin (DOGE) and Mpeppe (MPEPE). As Dogecoin continues to experience fluctuations amidst its established presence in the market, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is making significant strides in its presale stages, offering a unique opportunity for investors looking to capitalize on emerging trends. Dogecoin’s Steady Resilience Dogecoin (DOGE), the pioneer of meme coins, has long been a staple in the crypto world. Despite recent corrections, where Dogecoin (DOGE)’s price saw a slight downturn alongside PEPE, it remains a top choice for investors. Currently, Dogecoin (DOGE)’s price is hovering around $0.1057, with approximately 45% of its wallet addresses underwater. This data suggests that nearly half of Dogecoin (DOGE) holders are experiencing unrealized losses. However, this also indicates a lower probability of a mass sell-off, as investors are likely holding onto their DOGE in hopes of future gains. Interestingly, the on-chain activity for Dogecoin (DOGE) has seen a decline since mid-August, a trend mirrored by PEPE but not by Shiba Inu, which has seen a surge. Between August 16th and 22nd, the number of active addresses for Dogecoin (DOGE) dropped from 55,295 to 38,911, reflecting a slowdown in transactions. Despite this, Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to hold its ground, with many investors betting on its long-term potential. Mpeppe’s Promising Ascent While Dogecoin (DOGE) navigates its current market conditions, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is emerging as a formidable contender in the meme coin arena. Positioned within the Ethereum ecosystem, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is currently in its presale phase, where it has already raised over $1.2 million. With a current price of 0.001777 per token, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is attracting significant interest from investors looking to get in early on what could be the next big thing. One of the key factors driving Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s success is its strategic presale bonuses. Investors who participate in the early stages of the presale are rewarded with additional tokens, creating a compelling incentive to buy in now rather than later. This approach not only boosts the token’s initial market momentum but also fosters a sense of urgency among potential investors. Moreover, Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s compatibility with the Ethereum blockchain makes it an attractive option for those already invested in Ethereum-based assets. The token’s seamless integration with a wide range of wallets and smart contracts ensures that it can be easily adopted by the broader crypto community. With a total supply capped at 7.6 billion tokens, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is designed to maintain its value as demand increases. Comparing the Trends: Dogecoin vs. Mpeppe As Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to solidify its place in the crypto market, it faces competition from newer entrants like Mpeppe (MPEPE), which offers the allure of high returns and early investment opportunities. While Dogecoin’s price stability and widespread recognition make it a relatively safe bet, Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s potential for explosive growth makes it an attractive option for those willing to take on more risk. The presale success of Mpeppe is a testament to the growing interest in alternative meme coins. With each presale stage, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is edging closer to its public launch, where it could see a significant increase in value. For investors, the decision between Dogecoin (DOGE) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) may come down to a choice between stability and potential. Dogecoin (DOGE) offers a more established track record, while Mpeppe (MPEPE) presents the possibility of substantial gains as it moves through its development phases. Conclusion: The Future of Meme Coins As we move further into 2024, the meme coin market continues to evolve. Dogecoin (DOGE), despite its recent challenges, remains a strong contender with a dedicated community and significant market presence. On the other hand, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is carving out its niche, offering investors an exciting opportunity to get in on the ground floor of what could be the next big meme coin. For those looking to diversify their portfolios, both Dogecoin (DOGE) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) present unique opportunities. Dogecoin (DOGE) provides a sense of security with its established market position, while Mpeppe offers the thrill of high-reward potential. As always, investors should market outlook before making any decisions, but one thing is clear: both Dogecoin (DOGE) and Mpeppe are worth watching in the months ahead.

The answer lies in a combination of factors that suggest Mpeppe (MPEPE) could be one of the most lucrative investments of 2024. The Appeal of Early Entry: Mpeppe (MPEPE) is currently in its ICO phase, with a token price of 0.001777. Early-stage investments in cryptocurrencies often offer the highest return potential, as those who get in before the market recognizes a token’s value can see substantial gains. The Ethereum (ETH) whale’s investment in Mpeppe (MPEPE) at this early stage indicates a belief in the token’s ability to deliver outsized returns. Community-Driven Growth: Mpeppe (MPEPE) is not just another meme coin riding on the coattails of its predecessors. It is building a strong, engaged community that drives its momentum. This grassroots approach is reminiscent of the early days of Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), which both saw explosive growth thanks to passionate communities. The Ethereum (ETH) whale’s involvement could further galvanize the Mpeppe (MPEPE) community, driving the token’s value even higher. Diversification Beyond Ethereum: While Ethereum (ETH) remains a cornerstone of many crypto portfolios, diversification is key to managing risk and capitalizing on different market opportunities. By investing in Mpeppe (MPEPE), this whale is spreading risk across multiple assets, positioning themselves to benefit from the potential rise of a new star in the crypto sky. What Makes Mpeppe Stand Out? Mpeppe’s (MPEPE) unique value proposition lies in its blend of meme culture and tangible utility. Unlike many meme coins that rely solely on hype, Mpeppe (MPEPE) aims to build an ecosystem that offers real-world applications and benefits to its holders. Engagement Incentives: Mpeppe (MPEPE) is designed to reward active community members, encouraging participation through various incentives. This could range from staking rewards to exclusive access to community events or products, creating a sustainable model for growth and retention. Potential for High Returns: With its low entry price and growing popularity, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a high upside potential. For the Ethereum (ETH) whale, the decision to go all in on Mpeppe (MPEPE) likely stems from the belief that the token’s price will rise significantly as more investors recognize its value and utility. Market Timing: The timing of this investment is also critical. As the broader crypto market experiences fluctuations, new and innovative projects like Mpeppe (MPEPE) stand out as fresh opportunities for growth. The Ethereum (ETH) whale’s investment signals confidence that Mpeppe is poised to break out, particularly as other assets face stagnation or decline. The Ripple Effect of Whale Movements When a whale makes a move, the rest of the market often takes notice. This Ethereum (ETH) whale’s significant investment in Mpeppe (MPEPE) could trigger a wave of interest from other investors, both large and small. As news of this move spreads, it could lead to increased demand for Mpeppe, driving up its price and solidifying its place as a contender in the meme coin arena. Conclusion: A Strategic Bet on the Future The decision by an Ethereum (ETH) whale to invest heavily in Mpeppe (MPEPE) is more than just a bet on a new cryptocurrency, it’s a strategic move that reflects the potential for substantial returns. With a current price of 0.001777, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers an attractive entry point for those looking to diversify their portfolios and capitalize on emerging trends in the crypto space. For investors inspired by this whale’s confidence, Mpeppe (MPEPE) presents a unique opportunity to get in on the ground floor of what could be the next big thing in cryptocurrency. As the token continues to gain momentum, those who join the Mpeppe (MPEPE) community now could find themselves at the forefront of a significant market shift.

32765604,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=637521,1724434737,Ethereum ICO Has Gained Massive Momentum As Stage 3 Hits 76%,"The cryptocurrency space is abuzz with excitement as the Ethereum ICO has gained significant traction, with Stage 3 hitting a remarkable 76% completion. This development underscores the growing interest and confidence in Ethereum (ETH) as a leading blockchain platform, particularly as it continues to solidify its position within the global financial ecosystem. With recent news highlighting Ethereum (ETH)’s impressive ETF performance, it’s clear that the momentum behind ETH is stronger than ever. However, as investors look to diversify their portfolios, many are also turning their attention to Mpeppe (MPEPE), a promising new token priced at just $0.001777, which offers a unique opportunity to maximize returns. Ethereum (ETH) Continues to Lead the Crypto Market Ethereum (ETH) has long been recognized as a pioneering force in the world of blockchain technology. Known for its smart contract capabilities, Ethereum (ETH) has enabled the creation of a multitude of decentralized applications (dApps) and has been the backbone of the booming decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. The ongoing Ethereum (ETH) ICO, now in its third stage, reflects the continued confidence that both retail and institutional investors have in the platform’s long-term potential. Stage 3 of the Ethereum (ETH) ICO has reached 76% completion, a milestone that not only signifies strong investor interest but also highlights the platform’s ability to maintain momentum in an increasingly competitive market. As Ethereum (ETH) continues to innovate and expand its ecosystem, the completion of this stage brings it one step closer to realizing its broader goals. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The New Token Gaining Attention While Ethereum (ETH) continues to dominate headlines, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has emerged as a token of interest among savvy investors looking for the next big opportunity in the crypto space. Priced at just $0.001777 during its Initial Coin Offering (ICO), Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers an attractive entry point for investors seeking significant potential returns with minimal risk. Mpeppe is not just another meme coin; it represents a blend of community-driven growth and strategic utility, making it an appealing choice for those looking to diversify their holdings. The token’s low price and the potential for exponential growth have caught the eye of many Ethereum (ETH) investors who recognize the importance of having a well-rounded portfolio. The Success of Ethereum ETFs and What It Means for Mpeppe The growing interest in Ethereum (ETH) is further exemplified by the recent success of the Ethereum-ETF by BlackRock, which has recorded net inflows exceeding $1 billion within just a month of its launch. Despite Ethereum (ETH) losing over 20% of its value since the ETF’s inception, the inflows into ETHA have outpaced those of the three next-largest Ethereum ETFs combined. This speaks volumes about the confidence that investors have in Ethereum’s long-term prospects. This success story of Ethereum-based ETFs highlights the broader trend of institutional interest in cryptocurrency, which bodes well for emerging tokens like Mpeppe (MPEPE). As institutional investors continue to pour money into established assets like Ethereum (ETH), the trickle-down effect could see increased attention and investment in promising new tokens like Mpeppe (MPEPE), especially as investors look to replicate their success with ETH by getting in early on other high-potential projects. Why Mpeppe (MPEPE) is the Perfect Complement to Ethereum (ETH) For investors already committed to Ethereum (ETH), adding Mpeppe (MPEPE) to their portfolio offers several strategic benefits: Low Entry Price with High Upside: Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s current price of $0.001777 presents an opportunity for significant returns with minimal initial investment, making it an excellent complement to a more stable asset like Ethereum. Community-Driven Growth: Like Ethereum, Mpeppe (MPEPE) leverages the power of its community to drive growth and adoption. This grassroots approach can lead to rapid market penetration and increased token value as more investors join the Mpeppe (MPEPE) ecosystem. Diversification: Investing in both Ethereum (ETH) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) allows investors to hedge against market volatility while positioning themselves to benefit from the growth of different segments within the cryptocurrency market. Market Timing: As Ethereum’s ICO progresses and its ETFs gain popularity, the broader crypto market is likely to see increased liquidity and investment. By getting in early on Mpeppe (MPEPE), investors can capitalize on this momentum and maximize their potential returns. Conclusion: A Strategic Move for Savvy Investors As the Ethereum ICO nears the completion of Stage 3, the momentum behind ETH continues to build, supported by strong institutional interest and the success of Ethereum ETFs. However, for those looking to diversify their portfolios and capture additional upside potential, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a compelling opportunity. With its low entry price, community-driven growth, and strategic positioning within the market, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is quickly becoming a favorite among investors who are eager to replicate the success they’ve seen with Ethereum.

42417343,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYC6v,1724433464,"OK, Bloomer!","As we at CoinDesk woke up Friday morning and looked forward to a weekend of rest and recuperation away from the crypto grind, Bloomberg's Editorial Board published a fierce opinion piece attacking the industry we cover (warts and all). It did so quite clumsily.  The piece, ""Harris and Trump Shouldn't Pander to the Crypto Crowd,"" argues that our presidential candidates are too craven to the crypto industry and the many dollars it's donating this cycle (Public Citizen, a campaign spending watchdog, reported this week that crypto companies were behind half of all corporate election spending this year). ""The good news is that business interests are getting support during an election year. The bad news is that the business is crypto,"" the op-ed begins.  It then reminds readers that one Sam Bankman-Fried (him of the FTX imbroglio) once ""lavished cash on candidates in hopes of laxer regulations"" and argues that crypto is now engaged in a similar sort of exercise. It cautions candidates against ""abandon[ing] common sense in pursuit of cash.""  First of all, nobody should argue against ""common sense."" The phrase runs all the way back to 1776 when one of America's greatest sons uttered it for a great cause. Second, we can all agree that campaign contributions are inherently problematic: they sometimes cause candidates to do weird, partial things against the wider public interest. Many of us can agree that the tail-effects of Citizens United, which argued for unlimited corporate political spending on free speech grounds, are troublesome. It leads to a corrupted form of democracy where vigorous public debate doesn't normatively lead to policy in the widest interest.  So far, so good. But Bloomberg isn't really arguing against lobbying and election spending. Its editorial begins with that line about it being good that business interests are supported. The trouble is in how Bloomer makes its case.  Let's run through the rhetorical flourishes below:  ""... the stakes aren't especially high.""  Bloomberg says the U.S. isn't planning to ban bitcoin (like China or Chad), so what's the problem, right? Well, thank our lucky stars that we're not like Afghanistan! We are still free to use a form of money that's not controlled by a government because our government hasn't said it's not OK. Yipee! By this logic, we should also be glad we're not with China-Chad on issues like free speech, an independent judiciary and media, and freedom of association.  But maybe the stakes are higher than Bloomberg thinks? Money is already digital and, because of crypto, it's becoming increasingly programmable. That allows the wider capital markets, which Bloomberg covers with alacrity, to operate in more efficient, open and transparent ways. Crypto isn't just Bitcoin (though BTC still accounts for roughly half the total market cap); there are thousands of other flowers in this garden, from stablecoins to tokenized real-world assets. And crypto isn't just about assets; more fundamentally, it's a technology with hundreds of use-cases. More to the point: other modern, free and forward-thinking countries are embracing this technology while the United States still argues over basic facts.  In the 15 or so years since Bitcoin was invented, digital tokens have proved to be of essentially no practical value.  This sort of statement is easy to make, and exhausting to counter. But let's take a short stab and say that crypto has made a lot of people rich and employed many more gainfully (including many journalists we know at Bloomerberg). Stablecoins (market cap: $177,090,363,336) allow thousands of law-abiding folks to move money cheaply and effectively peer-to-peer and across borders, avoiding the onerous fees charged by traditional remittance companies. Bitcoin has often failed as a payment mechanism, as Bloomer says, but it's often proved an effective store-of-value (over the long term, even if it whipsaws day-to-day), which is partly why the SEC approved ETFs for Bitcoin (and Ethereum) and why people in soft money-nations like Nigeria and Argentina look to it as a hard money-alternative. I could go on and on and on. But it's a Friday in late August and dreaming of the beach is preferable to responding to sweeping statements that lack all form of nuance or fidelity to truth. You can insert your own positive crypto use-cases here____________________.  Policymakers [shouldn't] be encouraging people to park their savings in digital wallets instead of stocks, bonds and other assets that support the real economy.  I mean, first of all, politicians aren't investment advisers and their words shouldn't be treated as investment advice. But what does this ""real economy"" mean? Is a government bond part of the real economy, if that money is going to pay off debt from government spending during, say, Covid? Is that real? Is investing in Coca-Cola or Raytheon, investing in the real economy? Or are we really just investing in sugary drinks and missiles that do a lot more harm to kids than Ethereum does? Did mortgage-backed securities, pumped by a cocktail of explicit and implicit government guarantees and regulatory subsidies, ""support the real economy"" in the early 2000s? Isn't a real ""real economy"" one that supports individuals and families to live the lives they want, and doesn't crypto do that quite ably?  I could go on, but the beach …  Finally, Bloomer seeks some middle ground. ""Candidates should promise to work with Congress and regulators to ensure that the rules applied to cryptocurrencies are consistent with existing laws on fraud, money laundering and sanctions enforcement,"" it says.  Agreed. The trouble with this is that Congress and regulators really haven't been working seriously to establish ""rules applied to cryptocurrencies [that] are consistent with existing laws on fraud, money laundering and sanctions enforcement."" That's the whole reason why the crypto industry is spending heavily this cycle! Because it wants to get something done and it's tired of waiting.  Ever since SBF was found to be SBF, the focus has all been about stopping crypto from being bad. We've seen endless SEC enforcement actions against crypto companies, and endless moralizing from politicians and media high-priests. But we've seen precious little action. The problem is simple, and every single person in the U.S. crypto industry knows it: We still don't know what is legally permissible (and not) when it comes to digital assets. And, no, existing laws are not enough when many were written before Joe Biden was even born.  So, to recap. Thanks to Bloomberg for stirring us from our summer slumbers. Thanks to Bloomberg for drawing attention to the dangers of campaign spending. But, really, this editorial does no favors to the facts and the truth.

Bitcoin Price Rallies On Powell’s Dovish Tones Powell’s remarks struck a dovish tone, indicating that the central bank is open to further interest rate cuts in the coming months to address potential cooling in the labor market. This stance was positive for risk assets like Bitcoin, as it signals a more accommodative monetary policy stance from the Fed. Related Reading: Algorand Achieves New Record With 2 Billion Transactions, ALGO Price Jumps 14% Indeed, the Bitcoin price rapidly breached the $62,000 mark, a level it had not seen in over a week, as investors reacted positively to Powell’s comments. However, the rally was short-lived, as the price subsequently retreated to around $60,800. According to crypto analyst Inspo Crypto, Bitcoin now faces a critical juncture: We have to wait and see if Bitcoin consolidates below $61,000 again or heads towards the lower end of the upward channel, which is right at $60,000. If that breaks, we still have a safety net at $59,500. However, if BTC stays above $61,000 and the selling pressure eases, it could be an interesting and, above all, bullish weekend. Key Indicators Flip Positive Another analyst, Rekt Capital, noted that the Bitcoin price still lacks a daily close above $62,000, which would be needed to confirm a continuation of the recent price recovery. However, Rekt Capital suggested that Bitcoin could form a bullish flag pattern, similar to the one seen in early March 2024, which could enable a move towards $65,000 or higher over time. Market expert Ali Martinez highlighted a positive development, noting that Bitcoin’s bull-bear market indicator has switched back to bullish after oscillating between bearish and bullish territory since early August. This, Martinez suggests, could further bolster the case for continuing the price recovery witnessed over the past two weeks after Bitcoin briefly dipped to a 6-month low of $49,000 earlier this month.

32764212,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=637412,1724430601,Bitcoin Investors Are Still Fearful: What Needs To Happen For A Turnaround?,"Data shows that Bitcoin investors still hold a sentiment of fear as the cryptocurrency’s price continues to consolidate. Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Is Currently Pointing At ‘Fear’ The “Fear & Greed Index” is an indicator created by Alternative that, in short, tells us about the general sentiment present among the traders in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency markets. Related Reading: Aave Forms Sell Signal That Led To 27% Average Correction Last 4 Times To determine this sentiment, the index uses the data related to the following five factors: volatility, trading volume, social media sentiment, market cap dominance, and Google Trends. The indicator represents this mentality as a score between zero and hundred. Investors share a sentiment of greed when the metric has a value greater than 53. On the other hand, being under 47 implies dominance of fear in the market. The region between these two thresholds naturally corresponds to the neutral sentiment. Now, here is what the current value of the Fear & Greed Index looks like: As is visible above, the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index is 34 at the moment, suggesting that the investors are feeling fear. The current fearful mentality isn’t too strong, given the distance to the neutral territory. Earlier in the month, the indicator had shown particularly low values, as the chart below displays. On August 6th, the Fear & Greed Index had hit a low of 17, the lowest that it had gone in more than two years. When the indicator achieves such low values, it no longer reflects just fear but rather a special sentiment called extreme fear. Extremity fear is defined as the zone that occurs at 25 and under. There is also a similar region for the greed side, called extreme greed, occurring over 75. Interestingly, the extreme fear low coincided with Bitcoin’s bottom under the $50,000 level. This is similar to what has been observed throughout the asset’s history.

How the indicator develops in the coming days remains to be seen. BTC Price Bitcoin has been unable to find a solid break above the $61,000 level recently, and it appears that the latest attempt may have ended in a similar failure as BTC, which has retraced to $60,800.

The withdrawals ban was put in place after last month's $230 million exploit.  Users will be able to take out up to 66% of their funds in two phases.  WazirX, the Indian crypto exchange that lost $230 million to a hack in July, said it will start allowing limited rupee withdrawals after freezing them in the wake of the exploit.  Withdrawals of up to 66% of users' rupee balances will be phased in over the next month, starting Monday, it said in a Friday statement. From Aug. 26 to Sept. 8, users will be allowed to withdraw up to half of that limit, with the remainder available between Sept. 9 and Sept. 22.  WazirX said the operating entity for its rupee-related activities, Zanmai Labs, was not affected by the attack and had sufficient reserves to cover the balances. It had to keep the remaining 34% of funds back, however, because of investigations by law-enforcement agencies, the company said. The timeline for the release of those frozen balances is unclear, it said.  ""While we regret that users have not been able to make withdrawals of cryptocurrency from their account on the platform for some time, it is not possible to simply resume cryptocurrency withdrawals,"" the exchange said. ""Due to the cyberattack and loss of a significant balance of ERC-20 tokens as a result of the theft, there are insufficient token assets available to meet the liabilities arising from the token balances owing to users of the platform.""

This development undoubtedly presents a bearish outlook for Shiba Inu, considering Shibarium’s impact on the meme coin’s price. Related Reading: Here’s What’s Going On With The Shiba Inu Price The Shiba Inu Shibarium Records 97.6% Crash In Daily Active Accounts Data from Shibariumscan shows that the layer-2 network suffered a 97.6% crash in its daily active accounts between August 20 and 22. Daily active accounts on Shibarium peaked at 2,955 on August 20. However, this figure significantly declined on August 21, dropping to 341, and further tumbled on August 22, dropping to 309. These daily active accounts refer to the number of wallet addresses transacting on the network on a particular day. The spike in daily active accounts on August 20 coincides with the surge in daily transactions on that same day, with 28,680 transactions processed on that day. It is worth mentioning that network activity on Shibarium had been on a downtrend before August 20. The number of daily active accounts on Shibarium in the last thirty days has been in the lower hundreds. August 1 was the only other day on which thousands of wallet addresses transacted on the layer-2 network, recording 1,898 daily active accounts. Likewise, daily transactions on the network have also been on the low, ranging between 1,000 and 5,000 daily transactions in the last thirty days. Many in the Shiba Inu community would have hoped that the surge recorded on August 20 was the beginning of an uptrend in the network’s activity. However, the 97.6% crash shows that Shibarium still suffers a downtrend. This development has also had ripple effects on the Shiba Inu ecosystem. The meme coin’s burn rate has drastically reduced, and there have been days when no token burn was carried out. 70% of base transaction fees earned on Shibarium are automatically meant to be converted to Shiba Inu and burnt. However, this automated burn mechanism has yet to be fully implemented, likely due to the low activity on the layer-2 network. Shibarium Has Still Come A Long Way Despite this setback for Shibarium, the layer-2 network has undoubtedly made significant progress since its launch last August. To mark its first anniversary, the official X (formerly Twitter) account for Shibarium highlighted some of its achievements. This included the fact that the network has processed over 417 transactions and boasts 1.8 million wallet addresses. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Secures Community Support To Rally To $1, Here’s How Furthermore, Shibarium has executed three hard forks (Delhi, Indore, and Shanghai), all adding “vital functionalities” to the network. The layer-2 network has also become home to notable decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, including the liquid staking platform K9 Finance. Gaming Finance (GameFi) is also set to become another of the network’s offerings, with the gaming platform Shiba Eternity set to launch on Shibarium.

32762824,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=24045,1724424818,Switzerland Leads the Push for Open Source Software and Digital Sovereignty,"European nations like Switzerland, Germany, and France, are increasingly adopting Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) to enhance digital sovereignty, security, and innovation. Switzerland’s legislation just mandated government-developed software to be open source, while Germany and France have made similar moves to reduce reliance on foreign tech providers. The EU supports this shift through initiatives like the Free and Open Source Software Auditing (FOSSA) project, promoting digital autonomy across the continent. Avoiding Vendor Lock-In, Reducing Costs, and Increasing Security with FOSS In recent years, several European nations, including Switzerland , Germany , France , and broader EU member states, have increasingly embraced Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) as a strategic move to enhance digital sovereignty, security, and innovation. Switzerland, for example, has implemented legislation mandating the release of government-developed software as open source, reflecting a commitment to transparency and reduced dependency on proprietary vendors. Germany’s Schleswig-Holstein region has followed a similar path by transitioning its state administration to Linux and LibreOffice, prioritising control over data and reducing reliance on foreign technology providers. France, under President Emmanuel Macron’s leadership, has also shown strong support for open-source initiatives, integrating FOSS into public administration to foster a more competitive tech landscape within the EU. This push towards open-source solutions is not just about cost savings or technical superiority; it is deeply rooted in the concept of digital sovereignty. By using FOSS, European countries aim to protect their citizens’ data from being controlled by external entities, ensuring that public administrations maintain full control over their IT infrastructure. The European Union has further reinforced this approach through initiatives like the Free and Open Source Software Auditing (FOSSA) project, which focuses on securing and promoting open-source software across the continent. Despite some challenges, such as potential cuts to funding for key FOSS projects, the EU remains a strong proponent of open-source as a means to achieve greater autonomy in the digital realm. China has also recognised the strategic importance of FOSS, particularly in reducing dependency on foreign software. The Chinese government has replaced Windows with Kylin Linux across its public sector, a move driven by the desire to control its digital infrastructure more effectively. This shift reflects a broader global trend where governments prioritise open-source solutions to enhance security, reduce costs, and foster local innovation. By moving away from proprietary systems, these nations aim to create more resilient and adaptable IT environments that can better serve their long-term strategic interests. The global push towards Open Source Software (OSS) by these nations highlights a growing recognition of the benefits that open-source software offers in terms of flexibility, security, and digital independence. As these efforts continue to gain momentum, they set a precedent for other countries to follow, potentially reshaping the global tech landscape by prioritising open-source solutions over proprietary alternatives. How Does Free and Open Source Software Safeguard Digital Sovereignty? Digital sovereignty is becoming increasingly critical as nations and organisations seek to protect their digital infrastructure from external control and influence. In an interconnected world where technology is often dominated by a few large corporations, the reliance on proprietary software can expose countries to risks such as data breaches, surveillance, and loss of control over critical systems. Digital sovereignty ensures that a nation maintains control over its digital assets, data, and infrastructure, allowing it to protect its citizens’ privacy and secure its national interests. By reducing dependency on foreign software providers, nations can mitigate the risk of being subjected to external political or economic pressures that could compromise their digital infrastructure. The transition to open-source software plays a crucial role in safeguarding digital sovereignty. Unlike proprietary software, which is often controlled by a single entity, open-source software is developed collaboratively by a global community of developers. This decentralisation reduces the risk of vendor lock-in, where a government or organisation becomes overly reliant on a single provider for their software needs. With open source, governments have the ability to inspect, modify, and distribute the software as needed, ensuring that they retain full control over their digital systems. This flexibility is essential for maintaining digital sovereignty, as it allows nations to adapt their software to meet specific security and privacy requirements. Privacy is another key benefit of transitioning to open-source software in the pursuit of digital sovereignty. Proprietary software often operates as a “black box,” with users having little visibility into how their data is being processed or stored. This lack of transparency can lead to concerns about data privacy, especially when software is developed by foreign entities subject to different legal jurisdictions. Open-source software, on the other hand, is fully transparent, with its source code available for anyone to review. This transparency enables governments and organisations to ensure that their software does not contain hidden vulnerabilities or backdoors that could compromise the privacy of their citizens’ data. Security is also significantly enhanced through the use of open-source software. The open nature of the code allows a global community of developers to continually audit, test, and improve the software, making it more resilient against cyber threats. In contrast, proprietary software often relies on a smaller, closed team for security updates, which can result in slower responses to vulnerabilities. Open-source projects benefit from a collective effort to identify and fix security issues, leading to more robust and secure systems. By adopting open-source software, nations can strengthen their digital defences and ensure that their critical infrastructure remains secure from external threats, further reinforcing their digital sovereignty. What is The Philosophy Behind FOSS? The Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) movement has its roots in the early days of computing when sharing code was a common practice among programmers. However, as software became more commercialised in the 1970s and 1980s, companies began to restrict access to their source code, leading to the rise of proprietary software. In response, Richard Stallman , a programmer at MIT, founded the Free Software Foundation (FSF) in 1985. Stallman believed that software should be free for users to run, study, modify, and share. This philosophy was embodied in the creation of the GNU General Public License (GPL) , which ensures that any software licensed under it remains free and open for everyone. The FSF and its supporters promoted the concept of “free software” as a matter of user rights, focusing on the ethical implications of software freedom. While FOSS is often used interchangeably with Open Source Software (OSS), there are important differences between the two. The term “Open Source” was coined in 1998 as a way to make the concept of freely available source code more appealing to businesses and the broader public. Open Source emphasises the practical benefits of allowing code to be inspected, modified, and distributed, such as improved security and faster development. However, it often downplays or ignores the ethical arguments that are central to the Free Software movement. The key difference lies in the philosophy: Free Software focuses on the user’s freedom and rights, while Open Source is more concerned with the practical advantages of collaborative software development. The Free Software Foundation (FSF) plays a critical role in promoting and defending the principles of FOSS. The FSF not only develops and supports software that adheres to the principles of freedom but also engages in advocacy and legal efforts to protect the rights of software users. One of the FSF’s most significant contributions is the development of the GNU Project , a free operating system that, when combined with the Linux kernel , forms a fully free and open operating system. The FSF also provides legal resources and support to ensure that software licensed under the GPL remains free and is not co-opted by proprietary interests. Through its campaigns, the FSF works to raise awareness about the importance of software freedom and encourages users to choose FOSS over proprietary alternatives. In addition to developing software, the FSF focuses on helping users maintain their digital freedom by educating the public about the risks of proprietary software and advocating for policies that support software freedom. The FSF’s initiatives, such as the “Defective by Design” campaign, highlight the dangers of Digital Rights Management (DRM) and other technologies that restrict user control over their devices and data. The organisation also works to ensure that new technologies, such as cloud computing and artificial intelligence, do not undermine user freedom. By providing resources, legal support, and educational materials, the FSF empowers individuals and organisations to take control of their digital lives and protect their rights in an increasingly digital world. Through these efforts, the FSF continues to advance the ideals of the Free Software movement and promote a future where all software respects user freedom.

As Render (RNDR) continues to assert itself as a leader in the decentralized rendering space, savvy traders are diversifying their portfolios by including Mpeppe (MPEPE), which has shown promising potential for exponential growth. Render (RNDR) Continues to Lead in the Market Render (RNDR), known for its innovative approach to decentralized rendering services, has been on an upward trajectory, with its trading volume reflecting growing investor confidence.

42417331,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYBvZ,1724422486,How Blockchain is Enhancing Efficiency and Transparency in Finance,"What inspired you to start Hashnote, and what unique value does it bring to the cryptocurrency and blockchain ecosystem?  Hashnote is about bridging traditional finance and on-chain finance. We always want to be a regulated and responsible player in the industry. We also want to add significant value to our investors via the use of blockchain, so we are very thoughtful about where, how, and what we deploy.  The things I’m really focused on are where we can increase efficiency, which usually leads to reduced fees, increased returns, or reduced risk due to the fact we’re doing things on-chain. Those are the things we can do on-chain that make us better than other products in the market.  We also ask ourselves, ‘What can we do to prepare for a world where all financial instruments are settling on-chain?’ I think it’s relatively inevitable that the majority of financial transactions are going to end up settling on-chain.  What is the major challenge you faced in bridging the gap between traditional and decentralized finance?  There are a couple of challenges. I think the one that everyone is going to point to is regulation—it’s very unclear. At Hashnote, we went with the regulated fund structure because it’s the one where there is the most clarity. It’s also challenging to build things that are value-added, unique, and desired by the next set of users.  A lot of people have a wrong approach to tokenization. They take a traditional security product and tokenize it at the very end. And I think that’s kind of a garbage way to do it. I think if you’re going to do things on-chain, most of the time, it has to move on-chain very early to be able to harvest the value of being on-chain, whether it’s the automation or the decentralization or the verifiability.  How does Hashnote enable the security and transparency of digital assets for its users in the rapidly evolving landscape of blockchain technology?  All of our activities are done on-chain; hence all of our clients can see transactions that happen on their behalf, verifiable on-chain. All their fees are on-chain, and any intermediate steps that happen are on-chain as well. Our users can go into our user portal, click on a transaction, and see the transaction hash on Ethereum, which includes all the information related to the transaction. It gives you this transparency in a way we’ve never had in traditional finance, where you dig all the way to the base layers to find out what happened. Transparency is something we value, and many of our clients value as well.  One of the reasons we are partnered with custodians first is because it gives many of our clients the security of having their assets at the custodian of their choice. From a TradFi point of view, custodians are not a security issue; they’re really like an accounting construct, a way to know who owns what and how. In crypto, custodians are security and technology issues. They’re the ones holding your private keys. If something goes wrong there, it’s kind of like the end of the world.  What kind of products does Hashnote see as generating the most interest among investors?  Our most well-known product is USYC, a collateral token for posting as collateral in trading or investment use cases. The main draw of this product is that it’s very competitive compared to the traditional finance equivalent. My real goal is to make that yield-bearing collateral available in the traditional finance space, to be able to post tokenized collateral at the CBOE or EUREX, and I think that’s a real improvement in the traditional finance space.  The second product is called Harbor, which is a yield solution for crypto. This is interesting because of the types of activities you can do with assets as a digital assets custodian that you cannot do in traditional finance. For instance, the appeal of Hashnote Harbor is that you can keep your assets productive, generating yield, while the assets never leave the safety of your custodian. We’ve partnered with Anchorage Digital and Two Ocean Trust on that product and we’re looking to deploy it on other custodians as well. We also partnered with Copper, and we’ll be the first collateral available there in yield-stable assets.  The third type of product we're looking at is much more crypto-native. We partnered with CoinDesk Indices to provide a CoinDesk 20 Index Fund, and the demand for that product has really picked up in the wake of the bitcoin ETF approvals. The next step then becomes, “What’s next after the Bitcoin and ETH ETF approvals?”. It is a broad-based index fund. It doesn’t make sense to go down the line of tokens one by one. Why get exposure to one asset when you can own a broad-based representation of an asset class? Exposure to the CoinDesk 20 Index perfectly fits the bill.  Can you unpack Hashnote’s relationship with CoinDesk Indices?  Hashnote provides institutional investors and RIAs with streamlined access to the CoinDesk 20 Index through its CoinDesk 20 Index Fund Series, enabling efficient portfolio diversification. It delivers exposure to a market cap-weighted basket of the top 20 digital assets within the CoinDesk 20, offering a compelling alternative to traditional Bitcoin investments.  The feedback on the CoinDesk 20 has been overwhelmingly positive, with clients and industry participants recognizing its value as a reliable benchmark for comparing crypto investments. Furthermore, accessing the index via Hashnote simplifies the investment experience, providing straightforward access without the burden of managing multiple wallets and private keys.

42417340,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYC3p,1724422459,Fed Chair Jerome Powell: Time Has Come for Policy to Adjust,"As expected, Jerome Powell indicated that a rate cut is coming in September  Bitcoin and traditional markets at least initially have moved sharply higher  Investors will now focus on whether the initial rate cut will be 25 or 50 basis points  After a long wait, central bank rates in the U.S. now appear certain to be headed lower in September after Jerome Powell said the ""time has come"" for an easing in monetary policy.  ""My confidence has grown that inflation is on a sustainable path back to 2 percent,"" said Powell in his keynote address at the Kansas City Fed Jackson Hole Symposium. ""The labor market has cooled considerably from its formerly overheated state,"" he continued. ""We do not seek or welcome further cooling in labor market conditions.""  ""The time has come for policy to adjust,"" added Powell. ""The direction of travel is clear, and the timing and pace of rate cuts will depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.""  Though markets fully expected Powell to indicate that a rate cut was coming at the Fed's September meeting, the tone of his remarks likely leaned a bit more dovish than anticipated. In the minutes following the release of his speech, bitcoin {{BTC}} added more than 1% to $61,900.  A check of traditional markets finds big gains as well: The Nasdaq is higher by 1.7%, while the S&P 500 is up 1.2% and gold has climbed 1%. The 10-year Treasury yield has dipped five basis points to 3.80% and the U.S. dollar index has fallen 0.6%.  After years of near-zero Fed policy rates, the U.S. central bank in early 2022 embarked on a long series of rate hikes, eventually taking its fed funds rate up to the 5.25%-5.50% range in 2023. Since, it's been a waiting game, with the Fed wanting to see crystal clear signs that inflation was meaningfully slowing to its 2% target before moving to begin trimming rates. That day surely has now arrived.  The question going forward will be if the Fed cuts the fed funds rate by 25 or 50 basis points at its mid-September meeting. Markets continue to lean towards 25 basis points, but the chances of a 50 basis point move have grown to 32.5% currently from 24% one day ago, according to CME FedWatch. There remain some key economic reports between now and that September decision – August's employment and inflation numbers among them – which should be key to Fed's ultimate decision.  ""Lower real interest rates tend to weigh on the value of the dollar and can support assets that compete with the dollar, like gold and bitcoin,"" said Zach Pandl, head of research at Grayscale Investments. ""The combination of Fed rate cuts, improving U.S. political sentiment around crypto, and net inflows into U.S. crypto ETFs should support bitcoin’s price to return to all-time highs in the coming months.""",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Stephen Alpher,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/08/23/fed-chair-jerome-powell-time-has-come-for-policy-to-adjust,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/75557664201abd7e6236aa47f2f8d2847584afab-6000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
32761277,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=637488,1724422391,"3 Cryptocurrency You Must Be Bullish With Heading Into September ICP, RENDER & MPEPE","As we approach September, the cryptocurrency market is showing signs of a potential breakout, with several altcoins poised for significant gains. Among them, Internet Computer (ICP), Render (RENDER), and Mpeppe (MPEPE) stand out as top contenders for bullish momentum. Let’s explore why these three cryptocurrencies should be on your radar heading into the final quarter of 2024. Render (RENDER): A Rebound in the Making Render (RENDER) has been one of the most talked-about altcoins in recent months, and for good reason. After suffering a significant correction of more than 70% since May 2024, Render (RENDER) is now showing signs of recovery. The token, which powers a decentralized GPU rendering network, is nearing a potential breakout as it approaches critical resistance levels. According to recent analysis, Render (RENDER) is battling horizontal resistance and nearing a downward trend line. A successful breakout could see the price targeting key Fibonacci levels at $9.93 and $11.70, which would represent substantial gains from its current levels. With the Stochastic RSI indicating a shift in momentum, the stage is set for Render (RENDER) to lead the next wave of altcoin rallies. Render’s (RNDR) recovery is not just technical; it’s also driven by the growing demand for GPU services in the AI and digital rendering sectors. As these industries expand, Render (RENDER) is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the increasing need for decentralized computing power, making it a solid investment as we move into September. Internet Computer (ICP): The Long-Term Vision Internet Computer (ICP) has always been a project with grand ambitions—redefining the internet by enabling decentralized applications and services to run directly on the web. While Internet Computer (ICP) has had its ups and downs since its launch, it remains one of the most innovative projects in the blockchain space. ICP’s focus on creating a decentralized web is becoming increasingly relevant as concerns about data privacy, centralization, and security grow. With the continued development of its ecosystem and the launch of new dApps, Internet Computer (ICP) is gaining traction among developers and users alike. As the market looks for projects with long-term potential, ICP’s vision of a decentralized internet could make it a standout performer in the coming months. Moreover, Internet Computer (ICP) has shown resilience during market corrections, holding key support levels while gradually building momentum. As we head into September, ICP’s potential for growth, combined with its solid fundamentals, makes it a cryptocurrency to watch closely. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The Meme Coin with Massive Potential While Internet Computer (ICP) and Render (RENDER) are solid projects with long-term visions, Mpeppe (MPEPE) brings a different flavor to the table, a mix of meme culture and decentralized finance (De-Fi) with a dash of online gambling excitement. MPEPE is an ERC20 token built on the Ethereum blockchain, and it’s currently in the midst of a successful presale, having raised over $1.2 million. Mpeppe (MPEPE) is more than just a meme coin; it’s a comprehensive ecosystem that integrates De-Fi elements and online gambling features. The token is strategically positioned to capture the attention of both seasoned investors and newcomers, offering a unique combination of humor, community engagement, and financial incentives. One of the key attractions of Mpeppe (MPEPE) is its current presale stage, where the token is priced at 0.001777 USDT. With 77.48% of the tokens already sold, the presale is nearing completion, and the next stage will see the price increase to 0.0021 USDT. Early investors are not only getting in at a low price but are also eligible for a 20% bonus with the promo code “MPEPE20,” further sweetening the deal. The tokenomics of Mpeppe (MPEPE) are designed to drive scarcity and demand, with a total supply of 7.6 billion tokens and plans to burn unsold tokens post-presale. This, combined with the growing interest in meme coins and the potential for viral marketing, makes Mpeppe (MPEPE) a compelling investment as we move into September. Why These Three Cryptocurrencies Are a Must for September The cryptocurrency market is gearing up for a potential breakout, and Internet Computer (ICP), Render, and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are three projects that stand out for different reasons. ICP’s long-term vision of a decentralized internet, Render’s recovery and growth in the digital rendering space, and MPEPE’s unique blend of meme culture and De-Fi make them top contenders for bullish momentum. As we head into September, diversifying your portfolio with these three cryptocurrencies could position you for significant gains. Whether you’re looking for solid long-term investments or high-risk, high-reward opportunities, Internet Computer (ICP), Render (RENDER), and Mpeppe (MPEPE) offer a mix of stability and potential that’s hard to ignore. With the crypto market on the verge of a major breakout, now is the time to be bullish on ICP, Render (RENDER), and Mpeppe (MPEPE). Whether you’re a seasoned investor or just getting started, these three projects provide a unique opportunity to capitalize on the next wave of growth in the crypto space.

32761223,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=637485,1724422205,Boost Your Crypto Portfolio With Playdoge and Mpeppe (MPEPE),"Playdoge (PLAY) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are poised to offer substantial returns, thanks to their unique propositions, strong community backing, and innovative use cases. Here’s how these two emerging tokens can boost your crypto portfolio. Playdoge (PLAY): Nostalgia Meets Innovation Playdoge (PLAY) has quickly gained traction among crypto enthusiasts, particularly those with a penchant for nostalgia. Combining the beloved Doge meme with the classic Tamagotchi experience, Playdoge (PLAY) offers a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game where players care for their virtual Doge pets, earning PLAY tokens along the way. This innovative approach has not only rekindled fond memories for many but also created a lucrative opportunity for new and experienced investors alike. The Playdoge (PLAY) ecosystem is designed to reward engagement. The more players interact with their Doge pets, the more tokens they earn. This simple yet effective mechanism has already garnered a dedicated community, pushing the token’s presale to raise over $6 million. With the presale ending in just three days, now is the time to get in on the action before PLAY is listed on major exchanges. But Playdoge (PLAY) is more than just a game. It also offers a robust staking feature that allows investors to earn additional tokens by locking their PLAY holdings. The current Annual Percentage Yield (APY) for staking is an impressive 74%, making it an attractive option for those looking to generate passive income. With over 250 million PLAY tokens already staked, the demand and value of the token are expected to rise significantly upon its exchange launch. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The Meme Coin Revolution in Online Gambling While Playdoge (PLAY) taps into the power of nostalgia, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is making waves in the online gambling space. Mpeppe is an ERC20 token built on the Ethereum blockchain, designed to be fully compatible with a wide range of cryptocurrency wallets and smart contracts. This ensures that Mpeppe (MPEPE) can be seamlessly integrated into various platforms, enhancing its potential for widespread adoption. One of the most exciting aspects of Mpeppe (MPEPE) is its focus on the rapidly growing online gambling industry. By integrating decentralized finance (De-Fi) features, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a unique and thrilling experience for gamblers and crypto enthusiasts alike. The token’s use in online casinos not only provides enhanced security and privacy but also allows for faster, more cost-effective transactions compared to traditional payment methods. Mpeppe (MPEPE) is currently priced at just 0.001777 USDT, making it an accessible investment for those looking to enter the crypto market without a significant upfront cost. The token has already raised over $1.2 million in its presale, with 77.48% of the current stage’s tokens sold. With the next stage set to increase the price to 0.0021 USDT, early investors stand to benefit from significant gains. Moreover, Mpeppe’s community-driven approach, inspired by the success of meme coins like Shiba Inu and PepeCoin, adds an element of fun and engagement to the investment. The token’s viral marketing potential, combined with its application in online gambling, positions Mpeppe (MPEPE) as a strong contender in the meme coin space. Why Playdoge and Mpeppe Should Be on Your Radar Both Playdoge (PLAY) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) offer unique opportunities that set them apart from the myriad of new tokens entering the market.

32761168,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=637482,1724422058,Playdoge and Mpeppe Two ICOs That Got Crypto Whales Hocked On Gains,"In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, where opportunities for massive returns are both tantalizing and elusive, two Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) have managed to capture the attention and wallets of crypto whales. These whales, known for their strategic investments and ability to influence market trends, have recently turned their focus to Playdoge (PLAY) and Mpeppe (MPEPE). Both of these projects offer unique value propositions that have not only piqued interest but also set the stage for potential exponential gains. Playdoge (PLAY): The Nostalgic Game-Changer Playdoge (PLAY) has quickly become a hot topic among investors, especially as its ICO nears its conclusion. With only three days left before its listing on major cryptocurrency exchanges, the project has already raised over 6 million in its presale, signaling strong investor confidence and anticipation for what’s to come. One of the key reasons behind the success of Playdoge (PLAY) is its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, which has tapped into the nostalgia of the 90s by introducing a Tamagotchi-inspired Doge. Players take care of their virtual Doge pets, embarking on adventures and earning PLAY tokens as rewards. This fusion of gaming and cryptocurrency has proven to be a compelling proposition, especially for a generation that grew up with Tamagotchis and now seeks to combine that nostalgia with modern digital assets. In addition to its engaging game, Playdoge (PLAY) offers a staking function that further enhances its appeal. Investors who stake their PLAY tokens for at least a week after the trading launch can earn additional tokens as rewards, with the current Annual Percentage Yield (APY) standing at an impressive 74%. This staking mechanism has already locked over 250 million PLAY tokens in the pool, reducing the available supply at launch and potentially driving up the token’s price. With analysts predicting a possible 10x increase in value post-launch, it’s no wonder that Playdoge (PLAY) has become a magnet for crypto whales. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The New Gambling Powerhouse While Playdoge (PLAY) is grabbing headlines for its nostalgic appeal and staking rewards, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is carving out its niche as a leading gambling token with immense growth potential. Currently priced at 0.001777, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is still in the early stages of its presale but has already raised over 1.2 million, indicating strong early support. Mpeppe (MPEPE) is built on the Ethereum blockchain as an ERC20 token, making it highly compatible with a wide range of wallets and smart contracts. This compatibility, combined with its focus on decentralized finance (De-Fi) and online gambling, positions Mpeppe (MPEPE) as a versatile and valuable asset in any crypto portfolio. One of the standout features of Mpeppe (MPEPE) is its integration with online gambling platforms. By leveraging De-Fi protocols, Mpeppe (MPEPE) enables seamless transactions and rewards within the gambling ecosystem, offering users an exciting and profitable experience. The token’s focus on viral marketing and community engagement, inspired by the success of other meme coins like Shiba Inu and PepeCoin, adds another layer of appeal, particularly for a younger, tech-savvy demographic. Mpeppe (MPEPE) also offers significant potential for price appreciation, driven by its limited supply and strategic tokenomics. With 50% of the total supply allocated to the presale and unsold tokens set to be burned, the scarcity of Mpeppe (MPEPE) could drive up demand and value as the project gains traction. Why Crypto Whales Are Hooked Crypto whales are drawn to both Playdoge (PLAY) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) for several reasons: High Potential for Exponential Gains: Both projects are in their early stages, offering low entry prices and the potential for massive returns as they reach the broader market. Strong Community Engagement: Playdoge (PLAY) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) have successfully built strong communities around their projects, leveraging nostalgia, viral marketing, and innovative use cases to attract a diverse and engaged audience. Strategic Use of De-Fi and Staking: The staking rewards offered by Playdoge (PLAY) and the De-Fi integration of Mpeppe (MPEPE) provide additional incentives for long-term holding, making these tokens attractive for both short-term gains and long-term investment. Limited Supply and Burning Mechanisms: The burning of unsold Mpeppe (MPEPE) tokens and the locked supply in the Playdoge (PLAY) staking pool create scarcity, which can drive up prices as demand increases. Conclusion: The Next Big Thing in Crypto? As the ICOs for Playdoge (PLAY) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) draw to a close, it’s clear that both projects have struck a chord with crypto whales looking to maximize their gains. With their unique value propositions, strong community support, and strategic use of De-Fi, these tokens are well-positioned to become major players in the cryptocurrency market. For investors, the decision to participate in these ICOs could be a game-changer, offering the potential for significant returns as these projects continue to develop and attract more attention. Whether you’re drawn to the nostalgic appeal of Playdoge (PLAY) or the gambling focus of Mpeppe (MPEPE), these tokens represent some of the most exciting opportunities in the current crypto landscape.

32761119,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=637479,1724421889,Base Dawgz Holders Mirgreate To Rival Meme Coin Currently Priced at $0.001777,"As the meme coin market continues to evolve, investors are always on the lookout for the next big opportunity. Recently, Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) has captured significant attention, particularly due to its impressive presale performance, which has now exceeded $3 million. However, despite the excitement surrounding Base Dawgz, a growing number of its holders are beginning to shift their focus to a new and promising rival meme coin currently priced at just $0.001777, known as Mpeppe (MPEPE). This strategic migration reflects the dynamic nature of the crypto market, where savvy investors are always looking to maximize their potential returns. Base Dawgz (DAWGZ): A Rising Star on the Base Blockchain Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) is a meme coin that has made a strong entry into the crypto market, particularly within the Base blockchain ecosystem. The Base blockchain, a Layer-2 solution developed by Coinbase, has quickly gained traction due to its fast and low-cost transactions. This robust technical foundation has provided Base Dawgz with a significant advantage over many other meme coins, allowing it to stand out in an increasingly saturated market. The creative design of Base Dawgz, featuring a Shiba Inu mascot in parachute gear, has resonated well with the community. Inspired by the adventurous spirit of “Top Gun,” the project aims to blend fun with solid technological underpinnings. This approach, combined with high staking rewards and innovative features like the Refer-2-Earn program, has attracted a considerable number of investors. Despite its success, some Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) holders are beginning to diversify their portfolios by investing in Mpeppe (MPEPE), a new meme coin that offers a different set of opportunities and potentially higher returns. Why Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) Holders Are Migrating to Mpeppe (MPEPE) The decision to migrate from Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) to Mpeppe (MPEPE), currently priced at $0.001777, is driven by several factors: Potential for Higher Returns: While Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) has shown impressive growth, Mpeppe’s low entry price presents an opportunity for exponential gains. Early investors in Mpeppe (MPEPE) stand to benefit significantly if the coin gains traction in the market, with the potential for massive returns that rival even the best-performing meme coins. Presale Bonus Incentives: Mpeppe (MPEPE) is currently in its presale stage, offering attractive bonus structures for early participants. These bonuses provide additional tokens at no extra cost, making it a highly appealing option for those looking to maximize their initial investment. This strategic approach not only fuels the early adoption of Mpeppe but also positions it as a strong competitor in the meme coin space. Diversification of Investments: For many Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) holders, diversifying their crypto portfolios is a key strategy to mitigate risk. By investing in Mpeppe (MPEPE), they can spread their risk across multiple assets, increasing their chances of capturing substantial returns from different market segments. Innovative Features and Utility: Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers unique features and utility that differentiate it from Base Dawgz (DAWGZ). This includes multi-chain interoperability, allowing it to operate across various blockchains like Ethereum, Solana, and Binance Smart Chain. This flexibility increases its market reach and liquidity, making Mpeppe an attractive investment option for those looking to tap into multiple blockchain ecosystems. Early Adoption Advantage: Similar to the early stages of Base Dawgz (DAWGZ), Mpeppe (MPEPE) is still in its initial phases, offering early adopters the chance to get in on the ground floor. As with any cryptocurrency, early adoption often comes with significant rewards as the project grows and gains popularity. The Future of Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) While some investors are migrating to Mpeppe (MPEPE), Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) continues to maintain a strong position within the meme coin market. Its foundation on the Base blockchain, coupled with its innovative features, ensures that it will remain a key player in the space. However, the crypto market is vast and ever-changing, and the emergence of new and promising projects like Mpeppe (MPEPE) is a constant. For those who choose to invest in both Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) and Mpeppe (MPEPE), the potential for significant returns is amplified. By spreading their investments across multiple projects, they can capitalize on the strengths and growth potential of each, positioning themselves for success in the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies. Conclusion The migration of Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) holders to Mpeppe (MPEPE) underscores the importance of diversification and the pursuit of new opportunities in the crypto market. While Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) continues to thrive, the allure of potentially higher returns from Mpeppe (MPEPE), with its strategic presale pricing and bonus incentives, is driving investors to explore additional avenues for growth. For those who are willing to take the leap, the rewards could be substantial, making this an exciting time for meme coin enthusiasts and crypto investors alike.

32760353,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=637418,1724419839,Top Economist Predicts Bitcoin Price Top Before Worst Recession Since 1929,"Henrik Zeberg, Head Macro Economist at Swissblock, has reasserted his prediction that a US recession is inevitable, but not before a dramatic upswing in financial markets, including a substantial rally for Bitcoin to heights between $115,000 and $120,000. In his most recent analysis posted on X, Zeberg expounded upon the cyclical nature of markets and how they align with historical economic indicators and current fiscal policies. “REMEMBER!? In December 2022, everybody was BEARISH! I was BULLISH! We were told that ‘Imminent Crash’ was ahead of us – despite the fact that the market bottomed in October 2022,” Zeberg reiterated in his post. He laid out his refined predictions for major market indices and Bitcoin, pointing to a forthcoming “Blow Off Top”. Bitcoin Faces Its First Recession Ever A “blow-off top” refers to a sharp, rapid increase in the price in financial markets, followed by an equally sharp decline. This pattern is characterized by intense buying pressure that drives prices to extreme highs, often driven by speculative or euphoric behavior among traders. This surge in prices is usually unsustainable, leading to a significant sell-off as traders take profits or react to overbought conditions. Related Reading: These Are The Biggest Bitcoin Support & Resistance Zones, Analyst Reveals The blow of the top predicted by Zeberg could be triggered by the US Federal Reserve injecting massive amounts of liquidity into circulation to prevent a recession. Based on this, Zeberg forecast that the S&P 500 will rise to 6,100-6,300, the Nasdaq to 24,000-25,000, the Dow Jones Industrial Average to roughly 45,000, and Bitcoin to $115,000-120,000. Zeberg’s bullish stance contrasts starkly with his dire prediction for the post-rally period. “Now….. we are not at the top – yet! But Recession IS coming – and it will be the worst since 1929. Major Bear market (in 2 phases; Deflationary and Stagflationary – separated by a mid-way bounce as Fed enters in 2025),” he explained, suggesting a complex recessionary cycle influenced by both market dynamics and Federal Reserve (Fed) policies. The economist’s skepticism toward the effectiveness of impending Federal Reserve rate cuts is rooted in a detailed critique of similar historical measures. Despite the market’s expectation of a 25 basis points cut at the next FOMC meeting in September—a move supported by 73.5% of market participants (according to the CME FedWatch tool), with a smaller fraction (26.5%) anticipating a more aggressive 50 basis points cut—Zeberg remains unconvinced these will forestall recessionary pressures. Related Reading: September 10: A Bitcoin Game Changer, Says Hedge Fund Founder “But… but… Fed rate cuts…. ?? The Global Economy is breaking. US Recession begins December 2024,” Zeberg stated, reflecting his belief that short-term liquidity injections are insufficient to counteract deeper economic malaises. He points to the liquidity cycle metrics comparable to those seen in 2007, questioning the effectiveness of such strategies in preventing the 2008 financial crisis. Furthermore, Zeberg highlights the recent end of the inversion between the US. 2-year and 10-year Treasury yields, traditionally viewed as a predictor of economic downturns. The inversion, where short-term yields exceed long-term yields, is typically a signal of investor uncertainty about the near-term economic outlook. Another pillar of Zeberg’s argument is the recent job market data. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics revised its March 2024 total employment estimates downward by 818,000—the largest revision in 15 years—indicating significant weakness in the job market, far more pronounced than initial estimates suggested. “Economy much weaker than expected,” Zeberg commented.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  CoinDesk 20 Index: 1,987 +1.0%  Bitcoin (BTC): $60,841 −0.5%  Ether (ETC): $2,660 +0.9%  S&P 500: 5,570.64 −0.9%  Gold: $2,534 +2.2%  Nikkei 225: 38,364 +0.4%  Top Stories  Bitcoin traded between $60,000 and $62,000, keeping the broader crypto market steady with observers split on what the Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will say at Friday's Jackson Hole meeting. ""Given the good CPI reading last Wednesday, we're likely to get a dovish Powell tone Friday,"" Amberdata said in the weekly newsletter, hinting at a potential favorable development for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, the crypto-options-focused tech platform SignalPlus said Powell might be cautious. Over at Deribit, the options market isn't anticipating a Powell-induced volatility explosion. ""Single-day BTC options indicate a 2.5% price swing [in either direction],"" Martin Cheung, head of options trading at Pulsar, told CoinDesk. Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, said the setup looks good, with the ascending triangle pointing to a minor rally.  Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is promoting a decentralized-finance platform called ""The DeFiant Ones"" in his latest move to win over crypto voters ahead of the Nov. 4 elections. ""For too long, the average American has been squeezed by the big banks and financial elites,” Trump said on Truth Social. “It’s time we take a stand—together. #BeDefiant.” Crypto believers have long said that digital assets and blockchain technology can help unbanked people access the financial services industry. As of now, little is known about Trump's new platform, including its launch date.  Decentralized finance (DeFi) is making a comeback, and the total value locked in these projects focused on democratizing finance is expected to hit an all-time high next year, according to Steno Research. The DeFi Summer of 2020 came about as the U.S. Federal Reserve lowered interest rates to near zero. ""Interest rates are the most critical factor influencing the appeal of DeFi, as they determine whether investors are more inclined to seek out higher-risk opportunities in decentralized financial markets,"" analyst Mads Eberhardt wrote, adding that lower interest rates also reduce the incentive to hold dollar-pegged stablecoins and spur more risk-taking in the broader crypto market.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows ether's 30- and 60-day options skews remain negative, a sign of puts offering downside protection trading at a premium to calls.  Some traders seem to be taking protective puts ahead of Powell's speech.

However, Bitcoin has performed better over the past ten days, standing out amid the fluctuations. Related Reading: Where Is Bitcoin And Ethereum Headed? Analyst Reveals Key Levels to Watch The ETH/BTC chart reveals this shift. At the time of writing, Ethereum’s price in Bitcoin terms was 0.043, its lowest since April 2021. This highlights Bitcoin’s dominance in the current market environment. As prices move and investors seek an edge, critical data reveals a clear preference for Bitcoin over Ethereum in the past months. While the market may appear calm, history shows things can turn on a dime. Therefore, examining on-chain data and fundamentals is vital to anticipate potential shifts. ETF Flows Showing Bitcoin Dominance Traditional investors are showing an increasing preference for Bitcoin over Ethereum, as evidenced by crucial data from Farside Investors, a London-based investment management firm. According to their reports, Spot Bitcoin ETFs have experienced five consecutive inflows, while Ethereum ETFs have seen five straight days of outflows. While some market participants believe that the outflows from Ethereum ETFs are due to selling pressure from Grayscale, analyst and investor Lark Davis has countered this argument. He points out that “about 30% of ETH is already out of Grayscale’s $ETHE ETF,” implying that the outflows are driven by broader market sentiment rather than Grayscale’s influence. BLACKROCK NOW HAS MORE CRYPTO THAN GRAYSCALE Blackrock has now overtaken Grayscale in total on-chain holdings. This makes Blackrock the largest ETF-related entity on Arkham. Blackrock: $22,143,715,559 Grayscale: $21,996,062,828 pic.twitter.com/YrPZdrMObk — Arkham (@ArkhamIntel) August 22, 2024 This trend underscores Bitcoin’s undeniable dominance in the market, as traditional investors continue to favor BTC over ETH during times of uncertainty and volatility. BTC Technical Levels To Watch Bitcoin’s price is currently at $61,280 at the time of writing. It has been in a consolidation phase since August 8, oscillating between the local resistance at $62,729 and the local support at $56,138 in the 4-hour timeframe. This period of sideways trading has kept the market in suspense as investors watch closely for the next significant move. For a bullish confirmation, BTC needs to break above the $63,000 level and close above the daily 200 Moving Average (MA), a crucial indicator that typically acts as support during bull markets and as resistance in periods of deep corrections. The daily 200 MA has been a critical level for determining the overall trend, and reclaiming it would signal a potential continuation of the bull market.

42417318,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYBoL,1724413556,"Bitcoin Mining Opportunity Is Worth About $74B, JPMorgan Says","The bank reduced its CLSK, IREN, MARA and RIOT price targets to account for second-quarter results and changes in the price of bitcoin and the network hashrate.  JPMorgan prefers Iren and Riot Platforms, and says recent underperformance in these stocks presents a buying opportunity.  The bank estimates the notional value of the remaining bitcoin to be produced by miners at around $74 billion.  At current bitcoin {{BTC}} prices, the value of the remaining 1.3 million tokens left to be mined is about $74 billion, JPMorgan (JPM) said in a research report on Friday.  The bank reduced its price targets for some of the miners it covers to reflect second-quarter results and changes in both the price of bitcoin and the network hashrate. Hashrate refers to the total combined computational power used to mine and process transactions on a proof-of-work blockchain.  JPMorgan cut its CleanSpark (CLSK) price target to $10.50 from $12.50 while maintaining its neutral rating on the shares. It reduced the Iren (IREN) price target to $9.50 from $11 and kept its overweight rating. Underweight-rated Marathon Digital's (MARA) price objective was lowered to $12 from $14, and overweight-rated Riot Platforms' (RIOT) price objective was trimmed to $9.50 from $12.  The four-year block reward revenue opportunity is estimated to be around $37 billion, a drop of 19% since early June, but up 85% year-on-year, the report said.  The bank prefers Iren and Riot, and said recent underperformance in these stocks presents a buying opportunity for investors.  Riot has underperformed the sector year-to-date due to ""operational snags,"" but JPMorgan sees the potential for better sentiment and share-price upside in the coming months due to enhanced uptime and production metrics.  The bank noted that Iren has traded lower in recent weeks after reporting a sharp rise in power costs in July in relation to hedging losses. JPMorgan says these missteps are correctable and present a nice buying opportunity.

32756879,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=637368,1724410853,"Cardano Price Poised To Hit $2.88, Following Solana’s Fractal: Crypto Analyst","Crypto analyst @XForceGlobal shared a new video chart analysis focused on Cardano (ADA), a cryptocurrency that many are dismissing as a “dinosaur coin” at the moment. In the analysis, XForceGlobal (@XForceGlobal) provided an in-depth look at Cardano’s current position within the Elliott Wave cycle, suggesting that ADA is on the of entering a strong upward phase, commonly referred to as “Wave 3.” Cardano Price Could Soar To $2.88 The analyst compares the current price action of ADA to that of Solana (SOL). Earlier this year, Solana demonstrated a similar price trajectory under comparable market conditions. The comparison is drawn using logarithmic price charts, which clearly displays the Elliott Wave structures, identifying a WXY corrective pullback followed by a new impulse wave setup. “If we look at the actual wave count of Solana you can see that it did a WXY pullback. Now this corrected pullback caught us all off guard, it didn’t look like a correction pullback in the first place. It looked better as an impulse to the downside it caught everyone off guard. Even the bulls and even the bears,” explained XForceGlobal. Related Reading: Cardano Chang Upgrade Launch: ADA Sees 52% Explosion In Major Metric The Elliott Wave Theory, which is central to his analysis, posits that markets move in repetitive cycles of waves driven by investor psychology. According to XForceGlobal, ADA is mirroring the early stages of Solana’s previous rally, which saw significant gains as it entered the third wave of its cycle. The crypto analyst outlined that ADA is currently positioned in what appears to be the second wave, following a corrective pullback, which typically precedes strong bullish momentum. “In the previous bull market alone, we did an 18,000% […] and I’m not sure why people are just brushing this coin off as a dead coin. I believe it’s a very good coin but we just need to find the right opportunity in terms of the timing,” stated the analyst during the video. Delving into the potential future of ADA, the analyst projects a conservative estimate of a 5x to 10x times increase in its price. This prediction is based not only on Elliott Wave analysis but also on comparative historical data from other high market cap altcoins like XRP, which are currently in similar positions within their market cycles. Related Reading: Cardano Rises 8% As Hoskinson Reveals Launch Date For Highly Anticipated Chang Fork “Wave 3’s are usually the most profitable, if not arguably better than what XRP is going to be giving us because XRP right now is on Wave 3 to 4 and we don’t know how wave five is going to be completed and that’s usually the end of a trend. ADA is in a wave three and it may be even going for a wave five which can be even bringing us to higher levels that could be giving us a potential break of the all-time high,” XForceGlobal remarked. To quantify the risk-reward ratio, the analyst uses a long positioning tool that suggests a 14 or 15 : 1 one risk-reward potential, based on a prospective 600% run. Additionally, the crypto analyst emphasized the importance of historical context and the apparent neglect of “dinosaur coins,” in favor of more recent, meme-driven cryptocurrencies: “I believe dinosaur coins, AKA coins that have been trading since 2018 or so, that have a relatively long price history, may be setting us up for another run since they haven’t gone for a run during this whole memecoin narrative.” In conclusion, @XForceGlobal’shighlights a highly optimistic outlook for ADA. Via X, he stated: “Cardano did an 18,000% run in its last bull run, but it also did one of the strongest pullbacks during the bear market. Structure looks very similar to when SOL was creating a bottom as well for a 1-2 sequence. Wave 3 targets would be around $3.” At press time, ADA traded at $0.3842.

Trump on Thursday promoted the forthcoming decentralized finance (DeFi) platform ""The DeFiant Ones"" to his 7.5 million followers on the social application Truth Social, including a link to a Telegram group page for the project, which had over 40,000 subscribers as of Friday.  “For too long, the average American has been squeezed by the big banks and financial elites,” Trump wrote. “It's time we take a stand—together.”  Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr., reposted the image on his X account, having promoted the platform alongside brother Eric Trump for weeks. The scions are leading the project.  Little is known about the platform, including launch dates or specific details. However, messages posted on the DeFiant Ones’ Telegram group call it the ”Trump DeFi project” and the “future of finance.”  In separate posts earlier this month before the project was revealed, Eric Trump said he had “truly fallen in love with Crypto / DeFi” and was “about to shake up the crypto world with something HUGE.”  Trump, the Republican candidate, is no stranger to crypto projects. Trump-related companies or official licensing was previously used for non-fungible token (NFT) projects and a line of bitcoin-themed sneakers that sold out hours after launching.  An August disclosure showed Trump holds between $1 million and $5 million of ether {{ETH}} and made over $7 million in an NFT-licensing deal. In July, he revealed plans to release a fourth NFT collection.  In July, at the Bitcoin Conference in Nashville, Trump promised to maintain a ""strategic national bitcoin reserve"" if elected.",POSITIVE,ETH,BTC | ETH | FIAT,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/08/23/donald-trump-teases-the-defiant-ones-crypto-project-on-truth-social,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6ad5dce42b8b4ec691fff2a833386c188d5bbc3f-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

32755066,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=637253,1724407249,"These Are The Biggest Bitcoin Support & Resistance Zones, Analyst Reveals","An analyst has revealed the Bitcoin price zones that could act as major support and resistance centers for the cryptocurrency. A Large Number Of Investors Bought Bitcoin Inside These Zones In a new post on X, CryptoQuant author IT Tech has discussed the Bitcoin price levels that could act as support and resistance for BTC. In on-chain analysis, the potential for any price level to behave in this manner lies in the amount of tokens purchased. Related Reading: Aave Forms Sell Signal That Led To 27% Average Correction Last 4 Times Below is the chart from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock shared by the analyst, which shows how the price ranges near the current one look in terms of the number of coins that share their cost basis. In the graph, the size of the dot corresponds to the number of coins purchased at the price range. The dots of two ranges stand out: $59,160 to $60,973 and $64,670 to $66,483. Bitcoin had been just above the first of these ranges when the analyst made the post, but now the coin has dipped into it, meaning it’s retesting the zone. To any investor, their cost basis is naturally an important level, so they may be more likely to make some move when the cryptocurrency’s price retests it. When many holders share their cost basis inside the same narrow range, this reaction can emerge on a scale that can affect the market. Almost 1.7 million addresses purchased 965,239 BTC inside the $59,160 to $60,973 range, and after the pullback in the price, these holders would be sitting at their break-even. Generally, when the asset retests an investor’s cost basis from above, they are probably to react by buying more, as they could believe the asset would go up again to put them in profits. The coin can naturally feel support when this reaction is produced on an appreciable scale. As the range at hand is quite large, the analyst has called it the biggest support zone for Bitcoin. Since BTC is retesting it now, it remains to be seen whether investors would truly step in and buy the “dip.” If BTC feels support and finds a rebound, it will have to retest the resistance levels ahead. As mentioned before, the $64,670 to $66,483 range is host to the acquisition level of many coins. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investors Be Warned: Legendary MVRV Ratio About To Death Cross Holders at a loss may look forward to a retest of their cost basis to exit at their break-even and regain the entirety of their capital. So, large demand zones can provide resistance when Bitcoin retests them from below. The $64,670 to $66,483 range could prove a significant challenge for the cryptocurrency because of this. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $60,200, up 1% over the past week.

42417334,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYBxd,1724403970,"DeFi Summer Is Making a Comeback, Steno Research Says","Decentralized finance is making a comeback, and the total value locked in the crypto market is expected to hit an all-time high next year, the report said.  Steno said interest rates are the most important factor in influencing DeFi's appeal.  This year's expansion in stablecoin supply and the growth in real-world assets are also tailwinds for the DeFi market, the note said.  Decentralized finance (DeFi) summer is making a comeback, and while total value locked (TVL) in the crypto ecosystem is still well below its 2021 peak, it could climb to an all-time high as soon as the first half of next year, Steno Research said in a report on Friday.  DeFi's imminent resurgence is linked to interest rates, particularly in the U.S., because the decentralized finance market is predominantly U.S. dollar-centric, the report said.  ""Interest rates are the most critical factor influencing the appeal of DeFi, as they determine whether investors are more inclined to seek out higher-risk opportunities in decentralized financial markets,"" analyst Mads Eberhardt wrote.  Steno notes that the first DeFi summer, in 2020, came hot on the heels of Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts in response to the Covid outbreak.  Still, interest rates are not the only driver behind a comeback in DeFi. There are also crypto-native factors at work. The growth in stablecoin supply, which has expanded by about $40 billion since January, is crucial because ""stablecoins are the backbone of DeFi protocols,"" Steno said.  ""As interest rates decrease, the opportunity cost of holding stablecoins diminishes, making them more attractive – much like the broader appeal of DeFi in such an environment,"" Eberhardt wrote.  The continued growth of real-world assets (RWAs) such as tokenized stocks, bonds and commodities is another key factor, and the 50% surge in these assets year-to-date indicates robust demand for on-chain financial products such as DeFi.  Lower fees on the Ethereum network, the blockchain most widely used for DeFi, also makes decentralized finance more accessible, the report added.

32753202,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=637327,1724403642,"Algorand Achieves New Record With 2 Billion Transactions, ALGO Price Jumps 14%","In a recent report analyzing the second quarter (Q2) performance of the Layer 1 (L1) blockchain Algorand (ALGO), data analytics firm Messari highlighted several notable milestones achieved by the network during the period, with a record in transactions being one of the most notable ones. Rapid Network Growth One of the key metrics that stood out was the surge in Algorand’s average daily transactions, which skyrocketed by 104% to reach 4.7 million. The total transactions recorded a more modest 6% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) increase, reaching 425 million. Despite this heightened transaction volume, Algorand’s revenue took a hit, declining by 61% to $152,000. The report attributed this to a 46% depreciation in the value of ALGO against the US dollar compared to the previous quarter. Even though the average transaction fee rose by 44%, the overall dollar revenue still declined. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Target $63,000 But Must First Clear This Vital Resistance Level The 61% decrease in quarterly revenue was also traced to a correction following ALGO’s 1,747% surge in Q1, driven by a one-day spike of 43 million transactions linked to the ORA memecoin project. However, on a year-over-year (YoY) basis, Algorand’s revenue saw a substantial 1,241% increase, climbing from $11,000 to $152,000. On a positive note, Algorand reached a significant milestone of 2 billion transactions during the quarter, showcasing the network’s growth and adoption. Notably, the network took four years to achieve its first billion transactions, while the second billion was reached within just one year. Algorand Staking Drops To Lowest Level In A Year In Q2 2024, the amount of ALGO staked on the Algorand network declined 38% YoY and 6% QoQ, reaching its lowest level at 1.6 billion ALGO staked in a year. Messari believes this may be due to the decreasing rewards allocated per governance period. The percentage of Algorand’s eligible supply that was staked decreased by 4.7% QoQ and now stands at 20.2%. Meanwhile, Algorand’s circulating supply increased by 1.2% to 8.2 billion ALGO. Lastly, data shows that the market cap for stablecoins on Algorand increased by 15% QoQ, rising from $73 million to $85 million, primarily driven by a 32% increase in Circle’s USDC stablecoin market cap, which now accounts for 78% of the total stablecoin market cap on Algorand. Conversely, Tether’s USDT market cap dropped by 22%, making up 21% of Algorand’s stablecoin market share. EURD’s market cap remained at a 1% share of Algorand’s stablecoin market cap. ALGO Price Faces Make-Or-Break Moment The ALGO token has seen significant price gains in recent weeks after a challenging Q2 for the price and the broader market. CoinGecko data shows that the token has seen a 14% price increase in the last two weeks and 12% in the last seven days alone. This has resulted in ALGO trading at $0.1357, just below its 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), marked by the yellow line on the ALGO/USDT daily chart below, which currently acts as a wall of resistance for the token.

Most major cryptocurrencies were little changed, while ADA and AVAX experienced notable gains.  While U.S. bitcoin ETFs, particularly BlackRock's IBIT, continue to see inflows, ether ETFs are facing significant outflows, reflecting bearish sentiment toward products related to the Ethereum blockchain.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} rose through $61,000 in Asian trading hours while being mainly confined between that level and $59,000 over the past two weeks. Some traders are looking to the Federal Reserve's annual Jackson Hole symposium, scheduled for later Friday, for comments that may influence markets.  Major tokens were little changed, with ether {{ETH}}, Solana's SOL, BNB Chain's BNB and xrp {{XRP}} moving less than 2% in 24 hours. The broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a liquid meaure tracking the largest tokens by market capitalization, rose 1.7%.  Cardano's ADA added 3%, while Avalanche's AVAX jumped 10% after the blockchain was added as a network option for Franklin Templeton's OnChain U.S. Government Money Market Fund (FOBXX). FOBXX started trading in 2021 and became the first money-market fund to use a public blockchain to record transactions and ownership.  Spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) listed in the U.S. recorded $64 million in inflows, extending a winning streak to six days. Market leader BlackRock's IBIT took on the highest inflows at $75 million, data shows. However, some firms consider a general slowdown in the rate of inflows to be bearish.  Ethereum ETFs, in contrast, extended a record outflow streak to six days, continuing a dismal first month for products tracking the world's second-largest token by market cap. These ETFs lost just over $800,000 on Thursday, taking cumulative outflows to over $458 million since they went live on July 23.  Some market participants are looking to the annual Jackson Hole meeting later Friday for comments that may indicate the Federal Reserve's monetary policy direction, which will influence prices of risk assets including bitcoin.  ""The downward revision of U.S. non-farm payrolls highlighted a weaker labor market, sparking concerns that the Fed might delay rate cuts, triggering a selloff,"" QCP Capital noted in a Telegram broadcast Thursday, referring to a Wednesday report on jobs growth in the year ended March. ""These worries eased after the July FOMC minutes revealed some policymakers were open to rate cuts, signaling a more dovish stance balancing inflation and employment goals.""  ""Attention now turns to Fed Chair Powell's Jackson Hole speech tomorrow for more rate-cut signals. With markets betting heavily on rate cuts, unexpected economic data can have a significant impact. We favor principal-protected products capturing topside gains,"" QCP said.  Powell is expected to confirm a pivot to lower borrowing costs next month, as previously reported. This step has historically buoyed bullish sentiment among traders because access to cheap money ofter spurs growth in riskier sectors.  Some are taking a cautious view, however.  ""Risk markets might be more disappointed as Powell might want to do their best to give themselves some wiggle room against the four cumulative cuts priced into the year-end,"" Augustine Fan, head of insights at SOFA, told CoinDesk in an interview. ""That said, Jackson Hole has generally been a 'risk-positive' stock even in the past, so expect traders to be better buyers on dips.""",NEUTRAL,ADA | AVAX | BTC,ADA | AVAX | BTC | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/08/23/bitcoin-tops-61k-ahead-of-jackson-hole-as-ether-etfs-extend-record-outflow-streak,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/65399df8da905841d4c4c1f14dbec868701d1340-1288x860.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Despite the halving in April of this year, Bitcoin has experienced modest gains compared to the excitement of previous years. According to Ecoinmetrics, a platform known for providing insights into the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin is up more than 30% year-to-date. In comparison, NASDAQ gained around 20% over the same period. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s MVRV Ratio Nears Critical Death Cross: Will The Market See A Bearish Shift? Bitcoin And NASDAQ: The Tightening Gap Ecoinmetrics shared a chart in its recent post on X illustrating the narrowing gap and showing how the year-to-date returns for Bitcoin and the NASDAQ have started to converge. Earlier in the year, BTC saw a significant return spike, particularly following the launch of several Bitcoin ETFs in the US, which boosted BTC prices. However, as the year progressed, Bitcoin’s performance lost steam, allowing NASDAQ to catch up. This closing gap between Bitcoin and the NASDAQ suggests that Bitcoin is becoming more correlated with traditional financial markets. This shift could have implications for its role as an alternative asset. The gap between Bitcoin and the NASDAQ is closing. Year-to-date Bitcoin is up about 34% while the NASDAQ has gained 20%. It’s been a quiet year for Bitcoin so far. Besides the ETF launch boosting prices early on there have been no major drivers pushing Bitcoin forward. pic.twitter.com/LCGf8iuG6d — ecoinometrics (@ecoinometrics) August 22, 2024 What Does This Mean For BTC? According to Ecoinmetrics, “We’re now heading into a period of potential volatility.” This potential volatility could be largely tied to macroeconomic developments, particularly in the United States. Historically, Bitcoin has shown sensitivity to changes in US monetary policy, especially regarding interest rates. Lower interest rates tend to encourage investment in riskier assets as the returns on traditional savings and bonds decrease, making BTC an attractive alternative for investors seeking higher returns. However, the flip side of this scenario is the looming risk of a recession, which could dampen investor enthusiasm and lead to a more cautious market environment. Ecoinmetrics’ analysis suggests that while Bitcoin has held its ground so far, its performance in the coming months will be heavily influenced by the broader economic trend. The Federal Reserve’s potential rate cuts could provide the liquidity boost needed to drive Bitcoin higher, but if economic conditions deteriorate, BTC may struggle to maintain its current trajectory.

42417330,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYBuX,1724397518,Aave Token Has Beaten the Market With a 45% Price Surge. Here's Why,"Proposals aimed at overhauling AAVE's tokenomics and protocol's risk management have galvanized investor interest in the cryptocurrency, observers said.  The so-called Umbrella proposal could ease sell-side pressures for AAVE in the market, said Katie Talati, head of research at Arca.  AAVE, the native token of the decentralized crypto lending platform Aave, has rallied over 45% to $135 in four weeks, outperforming every other top 100 cryptocurrencies by market value, including market leaders bitcoin {{BTC}} and Ethereum's ether {{ETH}}.  Such has been the investor bias for AAVE that Helium's HNT is at a distant second position with a price gain of 26%, according to data source Coingecko.  AAVE's price rally began in late July after the Aave-Chan Initiative founder Marc Zeller proposed a fee switch to distribute some of the platform's net excess revenue to the critical actors in the ecosystem and buy back tokens from the secondary market.  ""There has been speculation that AAVE could activate their 'fee switch' to redistribute excess revenue generated by the platform to stakers. This follows a proposal aimed at seeking governance feedback on the protocol's potential to buy back tokens using surplus revenue and redistribute them to AAVE stakers and the minters of their stablecoin, GHO,"" Joshua de Vos, research lead at London-based digital assets data and index provider CCData, told CoinDesk.  ""This has boosted market sentiment around the project, with the possibility of new incentives for holding and staking AAVE,"" Vos added.  Another proposal called for replacing the ""seize and sell"" loan liquidation process that negatively impacts the AAVE price with a ""seize and burn"" mechanism that AAVE's GHO stablecoin and aTokens, representing assets deposited in the protocol.  According to Katie Talati, head of research at Arca, this so-called Umbrella proposal could ease sell-side pressures for AAVE in the market.  ""The proposal aims to create a new system, called Umbrella, which would use a variety of assets to cover “bad debt” in the protocol (when a position is liquidated and the collateral does not cover the cost of liquidation) versus only using the AAVE token to cover bad debt. The new system, therefore, would relieve some of the sell pressure on AAVE,"" Talati said in a note in late July.  Web3 agency Deelabs explained on X that buybacks would create persistent bullish pressure in the market and Umbrella would eliminate the negative impact on AAVE price during loan liquidations. ""This just scratches the surface. There is a lot more to this proposal,"" Deelabs said.  These proposals aimed at overhauling AAVE's tokenomics and protocol's risk management galvanized institutional interest in the token, algorithmic trading firm Wintermute said.  ""The tokenomics update discussion brought more eyes on the protocol back in July, and it's generally seen as a 'blue chip' defi asset that tracks the growth of crypto in general. Additionally, large funds have been allocated, and research notes have been written up for their investors,"" Wintermute told CoinDesk.  ""We have also seen similar OTC flow in the name from institutional counterparties wanting to get exposure,"" Wintermute added.  Aave is also the top protocol in terms of revenue and fees earned over the past four weeks. According to data tracked by TokenTerminal, Aave has generated over $27 million in fees, outshining other lending and borrowing protocols.  As such, some in the crypto community believe the token is undervalued.",POSITIVE,AAVE,AAVE | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/08/23/aave-token-has-beaten-the-market-with-a-45-price-surge-heres-why,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8f8a630524614b071214a7000e7a70c71616fa89-1280x718.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A Kraken spokesperson said ""Overall, we’re disappointed by today’s ruling, but we’re prepared and willing to comply with the court’s decision.""  The Federal Court of Australia ruled on Friday that cryptocurrency exchange Kraken's operator in the country, Bit Trade Pty Ltd, ""contravened"" with a section of the nation's Corporations Act. The case against Bit Trade was brought by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC).  Section 994B of the Corporations Act requires an issuer of a financial product to make a “target market determination” prior to the product being offered to consumers.  Justice Nicholas determined that ""By issuing the Product to retail clients without having first made a target market determination for the Product, Bit Trade contravened s 994B(1) of the Corporations Act when read with s 994B(2).""  ASIC said ""Since 5 October 2021, Bit Trade’s “margin extension” product has been available to customers trading on the Kraken exchange without a target market determination, as required by law.""  ASIC's announcement also said that the Judge ""found the obligation to repay a digital asset was not an obligation to repay money and was therefore not a deferred debt"" but agreed with ASIC that ""a margin extension in a national currency created a deferred debt which meant that the product was a credit facility.""  ""Overall, we’re disappointed by today’s ruling, but we’re prepared and willing to comply with the court’s decision,"" a Kraken spokesperson said in a statement sent via email. “We’re pleased the judge understood the nuances in this case, and recognised the challenges in applying existing regulatory frameworks to innovative technologies.""  Kraken's legal spokesperson cited the judgment as an example of how ""the law with respect to crypto offerings in Australia is not clear, adding that the ""Court found that Kraken's Margin offering is subject to a set of regulations called the Design and Distribution Obligations when we extended fiat currency to clients, but not when we extended cryptocurrency to clients.""  ""This is an unsatisfactory position for Australian investors. While we prefer that to be through legislative reform rather than test cases, at least we now have clarity from the Court in respect of our Margin offering, and will move quickly to comply and continue to service our customers.""  ASIC said ""the two parties have been given seven days to agree on declarations and injunctions"" and that it would ""seek financial penalties against Bit Trade.""  ""This is a significant outcome for ASIC involving a major global crypto firm,"" said Sarah Court, ASIC Deputy Chair. ""We initiated proceedings to send a message to the crypto industry that we will continue to scrutinise products to ensure they comply with regulatory obligations in order to protect consumers.""

Notably, XRP has exhibited interesting price action amidst wider market uncertainty, although many cryptocurrencies are starting to turn positive. While some market participants are still bearish on XRP, others are looking out for a very bullish trajectory. A crypto analyst has revealed an XRP technical analysis that many bullish proponents can resonate with. According to the analyst, XRP is set to surge to $32 in the coming months. XRP Price Surge Of Epic Proportions Despite the broader volatility, many cryptocurrencies have begun to show signs of recovery, with XRP also a focal point of interest. The XRP analysis in question was posted through the social media platform X by Tylie Eric. This analysis was accompanied by an XRP / U.S. Dollar price chart on the 1D candlestick timeframe. As such, the price chart shows XRP’s price action as far back as late 2020. Central to the analysis is the depiction of a symmetrical triangle pattern, which has been gradually forming since early 2021, when XRP reached a peak trading value of $1.96. Related Reading: Historical Data Suggests Bitcoin Could Rise 1,000%, Here’s Why Over the years, XRP has displayed a series of lower highs and higher lows, which have progressively tightened into a narrower trading range. This pattern is often regarded by technical analysts as a sign of a potential breakout, where the price could move significantly in either direction once there is a breakout. #XRP WELCOME TO MONDAY. I’m a visual individual. Let this chart rekindle the spark. pic.twitter.com/xZXe4cpou1 — Tylie E (@TylieEric) August 19, 2024 Recent price action now puts the XRP price trading at the upper trendline of the triangular pattern. A breakout to the upside would cement a bullish rally for the cryptocurrency. According to the price target noted by Tyler, this breakout could see XRP initially surging to its current all-time high of $3.5 before facing resistance. However, the sheer nature of the bullish breakout would see XRP quickly clearing this resistance and going as high as $32. His timeline for this happening is between now and the end of the year. This projection, if realized, would represent a substantial 5,230% increase from the current price of XRP. What’s Next For XRP? Market sentiment around XRP is currently mixed. Tylie Eric’s forecast is particularly bold, predicting that the XRP price could climb as high as $32 by the end of the year. While surges of such proportions are not new to the crypto XRP, the chances of such an XRP surge happening are very slim at the moment. However, XRP has seen several other bullish predictions of a similar nature in recent weeks, particularly in the wake of the conclusion of the Ripple-SEC lawsuit. Related Reading: Glassnode Report Reveals Why The Bitcoin Price Dropped Below $50,000 On the other hand, a segment of the market remains bearish on XRP. One analyst recently even went so far as calling XRP the “biggest scam in crypto.” At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $0.6008 and is only on a 1.29% gain in a 30-day timeframe.

Kennedy Jr. will drop out of the US presidential race on Friday. The rumors have made PolitiFi tokens rise over 15% on the last day. While tokens inspired by RFK Jr. have plunged, Trump-themed memecoins took the lead with a 40% surge. Related Reading: Dogecoin Soars 6.5% Following Elon Musk’s Post, Is A Breakout Imminent? RFK Jr. To Dropout Of The Presidential Race During this cycle, memecoins have been at the front of the industry, becoming the largest narrative of the first two quarters. Due to the sector’s nature, crypto investors have immortalized the current event through these tokens, including the upcoming November US presidential elections. A candidate’s crypto stance has become a key factor for voters after the Biden administration’s crackdown on the industry. As a result, pro-crypto candidates have received significant support from the community. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was among the first to share his industry-friendly approach throughout his campaign, endorsing Bitcoin and blockchain technology. However, recent reports claim the Independent candidate will drop out of the race on Friday. According to ABC News, sources close to Kennedy claim that the presidential candidate will endorse former US president Donald Trump after dropping out. Trump embraced the industry this year and later started accepting donations of different cryptocurrencies. Per the report, “One possible scenario being discussed is for Kennedy to appear on stage with Trump at an event in Phoenix on Friday.” Sources familiar to both candidates cautioned that nothing is finalized and “Kennedy’s thinking could always change.” Nonetheless, the news comes days after the Independent candidate revealed he would not endorse US VP and Democratic candidate Kamala Harris. Trump Memecoins Take The PolitiFi Lead PolitiFi tokens surged 15.5% in the last 24 hours, with the price of memecoins inspired by the former US president taking the lead. As the rumors of RFK Jr. endorsement hit, online reports revealed the republican candidate’s chances of winning the election rose again. According to Polymarket’s 2024 Presidential Election Forecast, Trump’s chances rose to 54% after the news, with a 7% lead against Kamala Harris’ chances. Following the news, the largest Trump-themed token, MAGA (TRUMP), saw a massive increase. TRUMP’s price has taken a hit since the end of July when it was trading above the $6 mark. The memecoin retraced below the $3 support zone following the August market crashes, registering a 41.5% drop in the last 30 days. However, TRUMP skyrocketed 55.6% toward the $4.14 mark on Thursday. As of this writing the token is trading at $3.7, a 40% increase in the last 24 hours. Other memecoins inspired by the former US president also saw a significant surge.

42417352,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYDF7,1724385600,"Sony, Electronics Pioneer Behind Walkman, Starts Own Blockchain 'Soneium'","Sony, the Japanese electronics giant famous for developing the Betamax and Walkman in the 1970s, is now starting its own blockchain.  Sony Block Solutions Labs, a joint project between Sony Group and Singapore-based Startale Labs, said Friday it's coming out with a new layer-2 network atop the Ethereum blockchain called Soneium.  The news signals that there may be a renewed interest from mainstream companies in building products for consumers with blockchain technology.  Soneium, expected to go live on a test network in the next few days, will make use of optimistic rollup technology, which allows users to transact on networks on top of Ethereum for cheaper. It will be built using the Optimism blockchain ecosystem’s OP Stack, a customizable toolkit that lets developers create their own networks using Optimism’s technology, with connections to other networks in the ecosystem via the “Superchain.”  Other networks that have famously chosen to use of OP Stack are the U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase’s “Base” and decentralized-identity project Worldcoin’s “World Chain.”  'Onboarding Web3 people'  Startale Labs is led by CEO Sota Watanabe, who is also the director at Sony Block Solutions Labs and co-founded the Astar Network. Startale spun out from the Astar Foundation, and helped maintain the Astar zkEVM, which leverages Polygon’s Chain Development Kit (CDK,) a competitor to the OP Stack, but making use of Polygon’s zero-knowledge technology.  Startale will be focusing its efforts and resources from now on only on Soneium, and moving away from Astar zkEVM, Watanabe told CoinDesk in an interview.  “Astar zkEVM will be integrating its assets and underlying infrastructure with Soneium,” Sony Block Solutions Labs wrote in a press release shared with CoinDesk.  The “first year is all about onboarding Web3 people, because technology-wise and the community-wise, it is a little bit early to onboard the general users,” Watanabe told CoinDesk. “And then phase two, within two years, we're going to onboard Sony products, such as, Sony Bank, Sony Music, Sony Pictures and so on. So we would like to integrate Web3 and blockchain technology into Sony's product. And in three years, we would like to onboard not only Sony, but also all enterprises and all general dapps on the top of it.”  “But this is a general timeline. We're going to try to onboard enterprises as many as possible from the first year,” Watanabe added.

32743048,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=637276,1724382048,Will Bitcoin Perform Better In September Compared To August? Here’s What The Data Says,"With each month, the Bitcoin performance can vary widely depending on how investors are feeling toward the market. Years of monthly return data available for the cryptocurrency have led to investors and analysts trying to pinpoint the cryptocurrency’s next move based on historical performance. As the month of August draws to a close, Bitcoin investors are already looking toward September in hopes that the new month will come with better tidings. Bitcoin Looks To End August On A Negative Note Despite starting out on a high note, the Bitcoin price saw multiple crashes in August as the month drew out further. The first week of the month came with a 30% crash for the BTC price, which translated to a market-wide crash that saw altcoins suffer particularly. Related Reading: Here’s What’s Going On With The Shiba Inu Price Since then, there has been a recovery in the Bitcoin price but it is far from its starting point. This price decline means that the month of August has followed the trend of the last two years, coming out in the red. So far, according to data from Coinglass, the Bitcoin price price is down 6.03% in the month of August, at the time of writing. The performance this month is not exactly out of the ordinary as the Bitcoin price has had more red months than green months since its inception. The data begins in 2013, and it provides 12 years of monthly returns since then. Out of those 12 years, the BTC price has closed in green in 8 different years, leaving only four green August closes for the cryptocurrency. So far, the only times the digital asset has closed the month of August in the green looks to be during bull markets. This is seen in 2017 with a 65.32% increase, as well as 2020 and 2021 with positive returns of 2.83% and 13.8%, respectively. Will September Be Better? Historically, the month of September has been even worse for the Bitcoin price compared to August. In 11 years, there have been 8 months of negative returns compared to 3 months of positive returns. This has brought the average monthly return for September to -4.78%. Related Reading: Ethereum Metrics Turn Positive: Can This Drive A New ATH Above $5,000? With August performing so poorly, expectations are that the month of September could go in the opposite direction. However, not everyone agrees with this point of view. Crypto analyst @btc_charlie on X (formerly Twitter) has warned that September may not go as planned. He points out that the same people who are saying that prices will go up are the same people who missed the Bitcoin bottom and top. Instead, he directs investors to look at the average monthly returns for September, which are negative, when making their decisions.

42417366,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYDUb,1724380200,R.I.P. Unhosted Wallet Rule,"In 2020, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network proposed imposing know-your-customer requirements on unhosted wallets, drawing immense backlash from the crypto industry. This week, the Treasury Department formally withdrew the proposal.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Know your receivers  The narrative  A 2020 proposal by the U.S. Treasury Department that raised quite a bit of consternation appears to be finally dead (after years of being mostly dead).  Why it matters  Anyone involved in the policy or policy-adjacent crypto space in 2020 will remember this proposal. Seemingly the entire U.S. crypto industry banded together to file thousands of comments urging the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and Treasury Department not to impose strict know-your-customer requirements on smart contracts or individuals maintaining their own wallets.  Breaking it down  In the closing days of the Donald Trump presidency, the U.S. Treasury Department – through the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, its financial crimes watchdog – issued a proposal for imposing know-your-customer requirements on unhosted wallets. This proposal was seen as being technically impossible to comply with for most wallets, given they aren't companies or entities and therefore don't normally record that type of personal data.  At the time, the proposal drew a huge amount of backlash. Lawmakers (including from the then-president's own party), company leaders and lobbyist groups all pushed back against the proposal, which was spearheaded by then-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Legal experts noted that the proposal's reporting requirements and definitions were too vague to be practically useful. It was also unclear how exactly exchanges or other entities might be able to implement the proposed rules.  The industry scored a major victory against the proposal after an initial comment period was extended by 15 days, ensuring that President Joe Biden would be in office and Trump/Mnuchin would not be.  The rule kind of popped its head up here and there, but was never seriously considered again. Finally on Aug. 19, 2024, the entire proposal was officially withdrawn.  Michael Mosier, the former acting director of FinCEN, told CoinDesk the withdrawal, ""shows that public servants see value in first collaboratively engaging risk/opportunity through innovation and empowerment around the financial equivalent of mobile phones, rather than rushing to limit people to landlines, switchboard operators, mailed checks, and everyone’s home address in a public phone book to keep them 'safe.'  Another proposal from FinCEN – also from the tail end of 2020 – remains alive. This proposal would implement the Travel Rule, a Financial Action Task Force regime that looks to take on money laundering via crypto by having financial institutions report personal information for the senders and receivers of transactions over a certain limit.  The original 2020 proposal set the limit at $250, well below the $3,000 threshold currently set for similar financial reporting, but this week's notice did not mention any adjustment to the threshold.  In a tweet, Mosier said the inclusion only tells the White House Office of Management and Budget that Treasury may take action on this proposal.  ""Items can be on there for many years but not move,"" he said.

Coin Center Wins Right to Sue U.S. Treasury, IRS Again Over Controversial Tax Reporting Rule: Coin Center won an appeal in its effort to sue the U.S. Treasury Department over the Infrastructure Investments and Jobs Act's amendment to section 6050I in the U.S. code, which the think tank argues will require unconstitutional information reporting.  On reporting  There was a fair amount of chatter on X (formerly known as the bird site, the hell site or Twitter) about a report that Vice President Kamala Harris was considering current Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler to be her Treasury Secretary if she wins the presidential election. This report went viral on crypto social media.  I reached out to a number of individuals who regularly engage with Senate staffers or work with lawmakers, all of whom said the story was false.  Sheila Warren, from the Crypto Council for Innovation, and Caitlin Long, of Custodia Bank, both also confirmed that this story does not appear to be real.  My colleague Ben Schiller took a look at this story in Tuesday's The Node newsletter, but I also wanted to deconstruct this a little, given the sheer amount of attention it received from individuals who believe it confirmed their worst fears about Harris.  One of the named sources in the article was Congressman Tom Emmer, currently the House Majority Whip, but the article specifically refers to a previous interview he gave to the Reporter. In that interview, the Reporter said, ""Emmer criticized the current Biden-Harris administration for being staffed with left-wing activists, and warned that some of those staffers might enter a potential Harris administration. Emmer pointed to Gary Gensler, the Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).""  Staffers with Emmer's office did not return requests for comment by press time on whether they'd heard something concrete to form the basis for his previous remarks.  Another named source was Katie Biber, the chief legal officer at Paradigm. Here too, the basis appears to be a past tweet, where Biber referred to a hypothetical about the political makeup of the SEC (which is composed of five commissioners) in a thread that didn't touch on the Treasury Department at all.  An outside spokesperson for Paradigm said the company declined to comment.  Now, the reason I'm bringing this up at all is because of the sheer amount of attention it received from people in the industry who claim to abide by the ""don't trust, verify"" motto – but appear ready to believe anything they see with no questions asked.  The law of whatevers suggests that it's always possible this story is true – but the evidence isn't there yet.

This, along with the overall bullish developments on-chain, helped STX remain profitable despite the market dips that happened this week. STX’s current position opens up possibilities not seen prior to the rally the token experienced earlier this month. With this in mind, the relative strength index of STX reveals an overall bullish narrative. Related Reading: Tron Rises 24% Amid New Developments – Will The Uptrend Continue? This leaves STX the opportunity to hold this trading range before resuming its upward trajectory. If the token regains momentum at a shorter period, we might see a return to $2 and more if the momentum continues. However, its significant correlation with Bitcoin might be a double-edged sword for STX. Any market movement made by BTC, in the long run, will be amplified and felt by STX’s small market compared to the top crypto. If Bitcoin suddenly flips, returning to sub-$60k levels, STX will fall potentially beneath its current trading range towards $1.2 or $1 respectively. For now, investors and traders should monitor the general swings of the market before making any big decision.

Aave Is Showing A TD Sequential Sell Signal Right Now In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has discussed about a Tom Demark (TD) Sequential signal that has taken shape in AAVE’s 1-day price chart recently. The “TD Sequential” here refers to a popular technical analysis (TA) indicator that’s generally used for locating probable points of reversal in any asset’s price. This indicator has two phases: the setup and the countdown. In the first of these, candles of the same polarity (that is, whether red or green) are counted up to nine. When these nine candles are in, the asset may be considered to have reached a point of trend exhaustion. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investors Be Warned: Legendary MVRV Ratio About To Death Cross Naturally, if the candles leading up to the setup’s completion had been green, then the TD Sequential would give a sell signal. Similarly, nine red candles would suggest a potential turnaround towards the upside. The second phase, the countdown, begins as soon as the setup is finished. This phase works much like the first one, except for the fact that candles are counted until thirteen here, not nine. Once these thirteen candles are also in, the price could be assumed to have arrived at another likely top or bottom. Aave has recently finished the first of these TD Sequential phases recently, as the chart shared by the analyst showcases. As is visible in the graph, Aave has finished a TD Sequential setup with nine green candles recently, meaning that the coin could have reached a potential top, at least from the perspective of the indicator. This TD Sequential signal has emerged for the cryptocurrency after its price has significantly outperformed the rest of the sector, showing a sharp rally of around 28% over the past week. In the chart, Martinez has also highlighted the previous four instances of the asset forming this signal. Clearly, the coin’s price went on to register a drawdown following each of these. More specifically, AAVE saw a drop of 27% on average after these signals appeared. Given this past pattern, it’s possible that Aave could end up seeing another similar decline this time as well. Related Reading: Bitcoin Resistance: Here Are The Challenges Ahead For BTC In a more positive development, Aave has seen a burst of activity on its network recently, as data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock has indicated. It would appear that the price surge has attracted a large amount of attention to the asset as the total number of active addresses has reached its highest point in over a year.

Even though there were flashes of strength after the climactic sell-off on August 5, prices are still below $2,800. The only positive for now, at least looking at the daily chart, is the impressive bulls’ resilience. Despite the wave of lower lows, buyers have soaked in the deluge of selling pressure, holding prices above the $2,500 mark. The bearish formation, nonetheless, remains, but one analyst thinks the rejection of lower prices below $2,500 is critical. Ethereum Bulls Must Keep Prices Above $2,500 In a post on X, the analyst said that bulls must hold Ethereum above $2,500 for the uptrend to remain. The round number, looking at price evolution in the daily chart, marks the base of the bull flag. Related Reading: XRP Price Poised for Steady Rise: Can It Maintain Its Uptrend? In the past few trading days since the spike on August 8, Ethereum has been trending below the $2,700 and $2,800 resistance zones. At the same time, support remains clearly at $2,500. As price action consolidates, a bull flag has formed, signaling strength. According to the analyst, if buyers keep $2,500 as their anchor, Ethereum is set to fly, reaching $3,150 in the next session. The recovery is welcomed, considering that the sell-off of August 1 through 5 was a bearish breakout formation. This sell-off breached the critical support zones of April to July 2024. Impact Of Spot ETFs and Ecosystem Growth The leg up, the analyst added, would likely be driven by inflow into spot Ethereum ETFs. Since approving spot ETFs in July, institutions have been keen to find exposure. Taking to X, one ETF analyst notes that inflows now exceed $2 billion, excluding the outflows from Grayscale’s ETHE. During this period, BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum ETF has been driving demand. Beyond the inflow from spot Ethereum ETFs, Vitalik Buterin thinks there has been positive progress that may prop up prices. Among these is the drop in gas fees in the mainnet and via layer-2 solutions like Base.
