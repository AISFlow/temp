42399728,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyZfd,1492032319,"Bitmain Debuts New Litecoin Mining Hardware, Citing Customer Demand","Mining manufacturer Bitmain has announced new litecoin hardware it is aiming to ship in July.  The China-based company listed the Antminer L3+ miner on its website yesterday, claiming that it will be the most powerful and efficient of its kind on the market. Published specifications indicate that the miner operates at a peak hash rate of 504 megahashes per second (MH/s), while consuming 1.6 Joules per Megahash (J/MH). The starting price is $1,370.  Notably, Bitmain international sales VP Gadi Glikberg said that new demand for litecoin, which has seen its price skyrocket in recent days, led the company to announce the miner.  Glikberg told CoinDesk:  ""Right now, the [litecoin] exchange rate is going up, so more and more customers are contacting us in search of miners. We try to respond through hardware, though production has certain hard timelines ... We try to keep an eye on the market and give more attention to projects that seem in higher demand.""  The hardware's release comes as the litecoin network moves toward adopting a scaling solution previously proposed by developers working on bitcoin.  Litecoin miners have started to signal their intention for adopting segregated witness, a proposal aimed at increasing the amount of information that can be stored within a block while also addressing issues such as transaction malleability. The change requires that 75% of blocks produced during an 8,064 block activation period must signal for the change.  At press time, that key level stands just over 78%, according to Litecoinblockhalf.com, meaning the activation will happen sometime within the next 30 days if the level of signaling remains the same.  For now, however, Bitmain isn't moving to devote significant resources to the litecoin space, reiterating the firm's commitment to bitcoin hardware.  ""Even with the recent increase [litecoin] still has a fraction of the market cap of bitcoin,"" Glikberg said. ""As mining and market cap are coupled, our main focus has and remains in bitcoin.""

42399723,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyZai,1492025670,UK Royal Mint Begins Testing Blockchain Gold Trading Platform,"Testing has begun on a blockchain-based gold trading platform backed by the UK's Royal Mint.  First announced  in November of last year, the initiative sees the 1,000-year-old institution – which creates and issues physical coins, among other items – developing a so-called ""Royal Mint Gold"" digital asset, each unit of which will represent 1 gram of gold held by the Mint. The Mint is working with bitcoin startup BitGo and white-label exchange software provider AlphaPoint to develop the market, with a planned launch eyed for later this year.  According to CME Group, which is also involved in the project, a number of as-yet-undisclosed financial institutions are also involved in the development and testing of the platform. The firm said that as much as $1bn worth of gold will be digitally represented using the blockchain being developed in partnership with BitGo, as detailed in a blog post published earlier this week.  Sandra Ro, head of digitization at CME, said in a statement:  ""This is the first digital gold product that is institutionally targeted – and the first to work with a government entity – to be currently in a live testing state.""  The Royal Mint will be responsible for issuing on-chain assets and maintaining the gold reserves. Rules regarding transactions and block creation will be verified and enforced by a community of validators which will include exchange customers, academic and public institutions, as well as corporate partners. Meanwhile, transactions will be verified by a peer-to-peer network of nodes. Wallets tied to the system will utilize multi-signature security protocols.  When the project was unveiled last year, Royal Mint chief finance officer Vin Wijeratne positioned it as a way to improve the ways in which gold is traded.  ""Developing a trading platform with CME Group will satisfy customer demands for faster, cost effective and secure ways to buy, hold and sell gold and complement our existing product,"" Wijeratne said at the time. ""This landmark partnership allows us to combine the world’s leading mint, the best futures trading platform globally and best in class technology.""

42399709,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyZNv,1492019232,Bitfinex Withdraws Lawsuit Against Wells Fargo,"Digital currency exchange Bitifnex has withdrawn its lawsuit against US banking giant Wells Fargo, a week after it was first filed.  Court records show that yesterday, lawyers for the plaintiffs – iFinex (the owner and operator of the exchange), its two British Virgin Islands-based subsidiaries and digital asset transfer firm Tether – filed a notice of voluntary dismissal in the US District Court for the Northern District of California.  The move comes after Bitfinex filed suit against Wells Fargo, accusing it of prohibiting four Taiwan-based banks – First Commercial Bank, Hwatai Commercial Bank, KGI Bank and Taishin International Bank – from completing outbound wire transfers on behalf of the exchange.  When reached for comment, Bitfinex representative Brandon Carps confirmed the dismissal and signaled that the exchange is seeking to look past the dispute.  He stated more information would be forthcoming.  Carps told CoinDesk:  ""We voluntarily dismissed our case, accepting the court's decision, and find that we're best served focusing our efforts on existing and developing relationships. We're preparing an announcement that should be out in the near term and will be delving into the matter in greater detail in a later post.""  As part of its initial filing, Bitfinex sought a temporary restraining order that would have sought to prevent Wells Fargo from blocking those transfers.  Despite initial concerns about the safety of user funds, the exchange has said that the freeze only applies to wire transfers. An initial hearing on Bitfinex’s request had been scheduled for 25th April.  A representative for Wells Fargo did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

42399712,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyZRr,1492012827,State Regulators Blast New Hampshire's Bitcoin MSB Exemption,"New Hampshire is weighing a bill to exempt bitcoin traders from money transmission laws – and state officials are speaking out against the measure.  Their argument centers on whether the government of New Hampshire should take a proactive or reactive role in the regulation of money transmitters within the state that use digital currency. The bill, first proposed in mid-January, seeks to exempt ""persons conducting business using transactions conducted in whole or in part in virtual currency"" from money transmission statutes in the state.  Perhaps unsurprisingly, the measure attracted broad support from grassroots stakeholders. And last month, the state's House of Representatives cleared the bill by a 185-170 vote. From there, the proposal moved to the Senate for further deliberation, leading to last week's hearing before the Senate Commerce Committee.  That hearing drew a number of supporters, including sponsors of the bill as well as activists from New Hampshire. Many of those who spoke before the panel pushed for its passage, arguing the measure would bring benefits to the state, according to a video published by the activist organization Free Keene.  Yet officials from both the New Hampshire Banking Department and Department of Justice spoke against it, appealing to committee members to either oppose the bill or create tighter controls.  Jerry Little, the states's banking commissioner, argued that, if passed into law, the measure would inhibit state regulators from preventing potential financial fraud, comparing the process to plane safety.  Little asked the panel:  ""I think the fundamental question here is, do you want the FAA examining the plane before it takes off, or do you want them looking for black boxes after the crash?""  Appearing later, James Boffetti, senior assistant attorney general for New Hampshire's Justice Department, spoke in support of the Banking Department's position, arguing that his agency wouldn't be able to police activity as effectively.  ""If you remove this from the jurisdiction of the Banking Department, it default falls to the Department of Justice,"" he told the panel. ""But we don't have the same restitution capacities as the Banking Department. We don't have the expertise.""

42399717,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyZUo,1492009211,India's Government to Consider New Digital Currency Rules,"A committee of government and central bank officials in India is set to propose new regulations related to digital currencies.  The Indian government's press service announced today the creation of an interdisciplinary committee drawn from both the Reserve Bank of India as well as the Ministry of Revenue, Department of Financial Services and the Department of Economic Affairs, among others.  Also included are representatives from NITI Aayog, a government-backed think tank, and the State Bank of India, the country’s largest bank.  According to the release, the committee will prepare a report, recommending policies related to money laundering and consumer protection, among other areas.  The report is expected to be delivered within the next three months.  The government said:  ""The committee will (i) take stock of the present status of virtual currencies both in India and globally; (ii) examine the existing global regulatory and legal structures governing virtual currencies; (iii) suggest measures for dealing with such virtual currencies including issues relating to consumer protection, money laundering , etc; and (iv) examine any other matter related to virtual currencies which may be relevant.""  It’s a notable development given that, just weeks ago, statements by a deputy state minister sparked a media flurry suggesting that India had moved to ban bitcoin, prompting calls for the government to clarify its position.  In a way, the committee will answer those calls in what could lead to a major regulatory shift focused on the tech. Yet the tone of the release – which states that ""the circulation of virtual currencies which are also known as digital/crypto currencies has been a cause of concern"" – indicates that the officials may adopt a stricter stance as they develop policy proposals.  The developments come more than three years after the Reserve Bank of India first issued a warning to domestic consumers about digital currencies.

42399720,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyZXl,1492005590,Blockstream Hires Ex-BTCC Exec in Global Market Push,"Bitcoin infrastructure startup Blockstream has revealed a new executive addition to the team – a move the firm said marks the beginning of its push to new regions of the world.  The firm, which is best known for pioneering experimental 'sidechains' technology, has now hired Samson Mow as its chief strategy officer. Mow is to assist the company's planned expansion into China and Canada, where the company is soon to open new offices.  Adding context to the move, Mow is a native of Canada, and formerly held a C-level position at China-based bitcoin exchange BTCC.  Mow told CoinDesk:  ""I’ll be helping with the productization of Blockstream’s innovations and technology and bringing those to market. I'll be working on setting up representative offices in China and Canada.""  With a background in bitcoin mining, Mow will also be looking into R&D for merge-mining efforts – a way to effectively trustlessly join sidechains with the main bitcoin network – as well as ""other advanced mining techniques"".  Blockstream CTO Greg Maxwell added that many employees fall into the category of ""quiet engineers"", but that Mow will be an exception.  ""I think Samson will bring a more extroverted component to our team here and that will be useful,"" he said.  Mow also helped organize the Scaling Bitcoin event series, of which Blockstream is a sponsor – although, perhaps, he’s best-known in the bitcoin community for his social media banter.  Global push  Using his experience helping expand another startup, Pixelmatic, in Asia, Mow plans to help Blockstream establish two new offices on an undisclosed timeline, in addition to its current San Francisco base.  When describing the reasons behind the global push, Mow said he will explore new business opportunities in the regions, as well as look into establishing hackathons and other community initiatives.  China is one region that's seen heavy pick-up of the scaling debate, with some blaming geographical distance for communication issues between bitcoin users in the region and the digital currency's developer team.  Mow brought up what he sees as misrepresentations of his new company in some of the public discussions.  ""Blockstream is not Bitcoin Core. This kind of messaging and education is important,"" Mow said, adding that this is a distinction the firm plans to continue to emphasize.  On a more technical note, the startup recently released a new technology known as 'confidential assets' as part of its Elements Project, which uses sidechains pegged to the bitcoin testnet to explore new features that can't yet be deployed to bitcoin proper.  Further, Blockstream CEO Adam Back has indicated that the firm will soon be releasing an update to Liquid, its private blockchain offering, and will also release additions to the bitcoin wallet GreenAddress in the near future.

42399724,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyZbh,1492002003,Sweden Incorporates Iran Investment Firm Using Only Bitcoin,"Investing in Iran just got a whole lot easier.  The Swedish government has allowed a blockchain startup to use a bitcoin account – as opposed to a traditional bank account – as a way to prove its liquidity and incorporate domestically with the Swedish Companies Registration Office, called Bolagsverket.  While the founders of Linköping-based Brave New World Investments initially took their idea of creating an investment vehicle for companies traded on the Tehran Stock Exchange to the six largest banks in Sweden, each, they said, refused the idea.  Investing in Iran is legal in Sweden, but concern among the banks that Brave New World Investments might be perceived as a violation of US sanctions against Iran proved an insurmountable obstacle.  That is until the Bolagsverket registrar in charge of the case, Madeleine Idvardsson, helped the company incorporate without a bank account.  Idvardsson told CoinDesk:  ""We examined whether it would be possible to use bitcoin as a non-cash property, and we found that it would be possible.""  To register a company in Sweden using bitcoin, the incorporators must provide a signed statement from an auditor that the value of the property is not higher than the actual company's value, among other requirements.  The statement must be made by an authorized public accountant and described in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for how the property’s value was determined, along with any difficulties experienced during the process.  The approval of Brave New World Investments was expedited by a previous approval that had been sent to Bolagsverket by the Swedish Accounting Standards Board for another bitcoin application.  Proof of bitcoin  While banks have built-in security features to help prove the identity of their clientele, using bitcoin proved a bit more complicated.  On 27th January at a pre-agreed time, two identical amounts of bitcoin were transmitted from predetermined bitcoin addresses to a another agreed-upon address that would serve as a substitute bank account.  CoinDesk has viewed the transactions and can confirm their existence. Now empty, the account is reserved for incoming transactions, while operations will be paid for, also in bitcoin, using other accounts and local bitcoin service providers.  Now that the company has been incorporated with a bitcoin account, Brave New World Investments co-founder Mikael Johansson told CoinDesk he is waiting for the final approval to open a bank account in Iran.  Then, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will be used to send funds to Iran, where they will be converted to the native rial and used to invest in publicly traded companies on the Tehran Stock Exchange.  Johansson said:  ""We want to invest in Iran. In good, hard-working companies and individuals.""  Thawing climate  Since the Iranian Revolution of 1979, nations around the world have held various sanctions against the country, with the US being the most vocal detractor of doing business with the country.  In recent years, however, the nature of those sanctions has begun to evolve.  For starters, since the US, the EU and others in 2015 signed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action for the peaceful development of nuclear energy in Iran, the EU has engaged in increased trade with the country.  In the US, on the other hand, the response has been different. Last month, US president Donald Trump moved to tighten US sanctions on Iran, in response to missile tests he believes could prove to be a possible threat.  Still, Johansson sees opportunity in the changing climate – for those willing to play by complicated international rules.  He told CoinDesk that in order to meet demand in Iran for outside investment, he will work with a diverse group of professionals to ensure his firm is compliant with both US and EU sanctions positions.  ""We have a process that we are working on,"" said Johansson, ""which we will have audited and reviewed by regulators to make sure that we comply with anti-money laundering directives, with counter-terrorist financing directives, and also sanctions in general.""  Bitcoin avenue  Now that Johansson’s firm has been incorporated, he wants to use bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to help Iranian companies overcome similar obstacles.  As mentioned, Brave New World Investments was unable to get an account in Sweden due to concerns described by Johansson that the local banks might perceive the account as a violation of their agreements with US business interests.  Similarly, for four years, interbank messaging platform Swift had cut all ties with banks in Iran. While some of those restrictions were lifted in January 2016 and international credit cards have been slowly entering the market, many sanctioned banks remain blocked.  ""The sanctions have impacted both economically, and in a humanitarian sense,"" said Johansson. ""Economically, they have been cut off from the international banking community.""  Johansson sees Sweden's willingness to accept a bitcoin account in lieu of a bank account as evidence of an emerging sector of companies that are unable to obtain bank accounts, but are doing everything from paying rent, buying copy machines and providing services using bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.  He concluded:  ""We expect a new segment of companies being unbanked and operating on cryptocurrencies.""

42399708,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyZMw,1491998377,Moody's: Don't Expect US to Lead Blockchain Adoption,"Moody's is predicting that blockchain tech will spark a transformation on the post-trade side of the securities business, but it argues that more developed markets may not play a prominent role in the near term.  The credit ratings service provider, famed for its economic analysis, published a new report today in which it maintains that industry titans are unlikely to be disrupted by blockchain tech – at least in the near to medium term.  Issued as part of a sector deep dive, the report examines the potential for blockchain across the life cycle of a securities trade, and offers a set of possible scenarios in which the technology and the legacy financial players might coexist.  Robard Williams, the report’s lead author, said that, while there is ample space for blockchain to thrive, barriers to entry posed by regulation and the sheer scale of incumbents ensure distributed ledger startups will more likely serve in complementary roles.  Williams told CoinDesk:  ""We really don’t necessarily see today’s incumbents being displaced or disrupted in the first instance.""  In the report, Williams highlights the back-end reconciliation and settlement processes that the agency believes are most ripe for blockchain solutions.  Further, his team outlines how as many as a dozen intermediaries – including buyers, sellers, brokers, exchanges and custodians – can be involved in processing securities transactions today, and how each party must manually reconcile its own ledger.  ""A lot of the activity that goes on here is on the cost side, it’s not high value-add. So where a technology can come along to reduce inefficiencies, reduce manual input, reduce reconciliation – we really see the post-trade as a place where a lot of those benefits can accrue,"" he explained.  Risk and reward  Moody's sees blockchain as a means of managing counterparty and credit risk.  While certain intermediaries like clearing houses, custodians and depositories will likely see a drop in income should certain process be moved to a blockchain, Williams insisted that the new operating efficiencies created will be enough to compensate – provided that the firm is sufficiently forward-thinking.  ""They'll need to have the financial wherewithal and 'vision' to implement and get on board,” he said. “You could see, potentially, a smaller firm being left behind, but as of today we think that this is really an enabling technology.""  Still, in addition to universal questions of interoperability, scalability and the need for industry standards and governance, the analysts highlight several industry-specific dilemmas that must be solved, including the question of whether blockchain solutions can sufficiently compete with existing processes to justify the investment.  ""It is uncertain whether blockchain solutions can manage high-volume, high-speed transaction flows,"" the report notes.  Possible scenarios  The report goes on to lay out three possible scenarios for how blockchain adoption in the post-trade space could take shape – ranging from the current financial institutions leading the way to hostile takeover and disruption.  A middle-ground scenario is also posed in which a single incumbent pushes the needle in conjunction with startups.  While this scenario is deemed unlikely in the medium term, at least in some major markets, it could unfold in markets with more consolidated capital markets, the report projects.  This scenario is perhaps most likely in developed markets such as Australia, Brazil, Canada, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea and Singapore, which it argued has fewer intermediaries involved in processes today.  The way forward could be more complex elsewhere, the report argues, concluding:  ""In markets with many more intermediaries, such as the EU, the UK and the US, more collaboration among firms will be required in order to realize the true benefit of blockchain technology.""

While details as to how the integration will take place are scarce, the statement nonetheless affirms past remarks from the UK central bank. In September, the bank stated it was considering how its next RTGS could be built to best leverage distributed ledger advances.  In a speech today at International FinTech Conference 2017, governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney further reiterated past comments that have found the bank speaking openly about the benefits of blockchain systems.  In particular, Carney said he believes securities settlement to be ""particularly ripe for innovation"" given that the presence of many intermediaries keeps ""operational risks high"".  He told the audience:  ""In particular, distributed ledger technology could yield significant gains in the accuracy, efficiency and security of such processes, saving tens of billions of pounds of bank capital and significantly improving the resilience of the system.""  ""Industry has begun to work together to determine how distributed ledger technologies could be used to solve these issues at scale,"" he continued.  Still, he cautioned that the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has stated that it believes settlement times can be reduced with existing technologies.  ""This requires market participants to change their collective practices as it takes more than one intermediary in a chain to compress settlement times,"" Carney said.  In other comments, the governor's speech focused on the Bank of England's accelerator efforts, noting that it is particularly interested in privacy advances enabled by DLT.

First revealed on 20th March, the so-called National Blockchain Coalition was established by the Ministry of Economic Affairs' information technology team.  Overall, the initiative aims to unite more than 20 public and private organizations including the government agencies, universities and private companies from financial, logistics and energy sectors, with the goal of turning the country into a leader on blockchain tech.  Major supporters include ABN Amro, ING and Nationale-Nederlanden, one of the region's largest insurance companies.  In statements, Minister of Economic Affairs Henk Kamp stressed his optimism that blockchain technology would help make digital payments and data exchange easier and safer for global users, while improving the economic outlook of the Netherlands.  Kamp said:  ""By keeping the Netherlands at the forefront of the application of innovative technologies, our knowledge base remains progressive and world-class. That creates jobs and income.""  The combined initial funding of the founding partners amounts to €700,000 by the end of March. Each member will invest €200,000 and €500,000 will come from available government capita.  High priorities  The statements coincided with the release of the National Blockchain Coalition's full agenda, of which identity was high on the list of the priorities.  The agenda went on to explain how the group would now need to work with leading legal entities and other objects on standardization and interoperability challenges in 2017 on this goal and others.  Overall, the coalition aims to speed up the pace of rollout of blockchain technology within the government and use more government records such as data from the National Office of Identity Data, Chamber of Commerce, and registration records from the Ministry of Security and Justice.

42399719,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyZWm,1491987603,UK Research Council to Award £3.6 Million in Blockchain Grants,"A UK-based research agency charged with distributing government grants has announced that £3.6m ($4.5m) will be made available to seven blockchain projects.  Revealed yesterday, the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) said the grants will range from £420,000 ($525,000) to £617,000 ($772,000). The funds will be issued under its ""Digital Economy Theme"", an effort aimed at supporting research around digital technologies that could have a positive impact on daily life.  The EPSRC is the main funding agency for science and research initiatives in the UK, investing approximately £800m ($100m) annually for research and postgraduate training.  According to EPSRC chief executive Philip Nelson, the decision to award the blockchain grants was made due to the apparent maturation of the industry beyond financial use cases.  He said in a statement:  ""Distributed Ledger Technology may be synonymous with bitcoin to many, but as these projects show it has disruptive potential across a wide range of products and services. If it delivers on its radical promise, it could make a significant impact on the economy and society.""  Each of the seven EPSRC-funded projects will bring together universities and private-sector companies, with projects being led by professors from British colleges and universities.  Receiving the most funding, at £617,000, will be an initiative focused on regulation and compliance models.  The project is being led by Professor Tomaso Aste of University College London and will gain insight from blockchain consortium R3, as well as public institutions like the Cyprus Securities & Exchange Commission, the UK Financial Conduct Authority and the London School of Economics.
