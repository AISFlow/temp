42424869,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWrdh,1368127824,New BitBox exchange promises 'secret weapons',"It’s the newest bitcoin exchange and the first to be incubated at a university. BitBox launched this week with CEO Kinnard Hockenhull promising innovation from the get-go.  ""We've got a couple of secret weapons in the works but you'll have to wait to get the scoop on them,"" Hockenhull said in an e-mail to CoinDesk.  Recent events have shown that the bitcoin economy is too large for a single exchange to handle, Hockenhull said, in a veiled reference to the market-dominating bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox.  ""Simply put, there aren't enough exchanges for bitcoin to be as successful as we all want it to be,"" he said. ""Even if we weren't offering anything new (and we are), we're working to make sure that there are no single points of failure in the bitconomy by increasing the number of options people have.""  The BitBox platform empowers anyone to store, trade and track bitcoin, the company states on its website:  ""We want to make bitcoin easy to get and easy to use for both merchants and consumers through seamless banking integration, secure storage, and a joyful user experience.""  Hockenhull says the company, registered in the state of Michigan, has taken steps to avoid the hacker attacks that have plagued the Mt. Gox exchange: ""We use cloud-mirroring services, have a more efficient, spam-protected order-matching engine and are pursuing a DDoS (denial of service) shield partner.""  Conceived at the University of Michiganhttp://www.cfe.umich.edu/techarb/, BitBox is compliant with US Financial Crime Enforcement Network (finCEN) rules, says Hockenhull, adding that he believes the regulations around bitcoin will only increase over time.  ""What that means, few -- if any -- people can say, including the regulators,"" Hockenhull says.  ""Bitcoin isn't just money or a way to make money,"" he adds. ""It's a movement to change the meaning of money. We understand that and want to be at the forefront of it.""",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE,Doug Watt,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/05/09/new-bitbox-exchange-promises-secret-weapons,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e59de4ea45f998e12c500bb0c6bcf20003320ac5-628x356.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42424861,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWrNh,1368123731,Gyft gift card app lets buyers use bitcoins,"Plastic gift cards are so 2012, but going mobile and digital with your gift-card purchases isn't enough anymore. Now you can pay for gift card apps with bitcoins.  California-based Gyft, a digital gift card platform serving the US, announced today that it has partnered with BitPay to begin accepting bitcoin payments from customers.  While Gyft offers both an iPhone app and an Android app, the bitcoin option will be available only on Android. The app itself is free.  By enabling bitcoin payments for gift cards, the Gyft-BitPay partnership essentially opens the door to let bitcoin fans indirectly spend the digital currency at numerous stores that don't currently accept bitcoins themselves.  ""By using our existing network of retailers, we are able to offer bitcoin consumers the ability to instantly spend their bitcoins at hundreds of merchants,"" said Vinny Lingham, co-founder and CEO of Gyft.  Gyft supports gift card purchases from such retailers as American Eagle, Brookstone, Burger King, Gamestop, GAP, Lowes, Marriott, Nike and Sports Authority, among others.  ""Any shopper in a participating retail store, with bitcoins on their Android device, can easily convert bitcoins into a store gift card and pay for their purchase,"" said Tony Gallippi, co-founder and CEO of BitPay. ""The whole process takes less than one minute and can be done on a single mobile device.""",POSITIVE,없음,BTC,Shirley Siluk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/05/09/gyft-gift-card-app-lets-buyers-use-bitcoins,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/52f616208a6f6747df2eefbf696e97dc32973f77-628x301.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42424876,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWrnh,1368112440,What's a Casascius coin?,"A Casascius coin is the name of a certain type of physical – rather than purely digital -- bitcoin.  Mike Caldwell  , a resident of Sandy, Utah, in the US, first introduced physical bitcoins for purchase in 2011. He coined the name “Casascius” from an acronym for “call a spade a spade.” Caldwell posts updates about his coins on the blog, “Casascius: You asked for change, I gave you coins.”  How does a Casascius work?  Each coin holds the key to the digital value assigned to a particular bitcoin account.  Though the coins are designed to reflect the relative worth of an account, they’re actually just secure containers for the digital information that unlocks the bitcoin’s value. The eight-character code on the outside of the coin corresponds to the first eight characters of an individual bitcoin address, which is assigned specifically to that coin. The individual bitcoin account’s “private key” is embedded on a card inside each coin.  The digital bitcoin, of course, is located online, found in the public “block chain” that records every bitcoin transaction on the internet. The digital coin connected to each Casascius is accessible only to the person who has the private key from the physical coin.  To spend a Casascius, the owner uses the code embedded into it to access the digital bitcoin online. The private key code can be imported directly into bitcoin clients or exchanges like Armory, Blockchain.info or Mt. Gox to deposit funds.  How can anyone tell if a Casascius coin is good?  The coin’s design includes a tamper-evident hologram label that conceals the private key. Peeling off the label to access the key leaves behind a tell-tale honeycomb pattern that indicates the coin has been used.  Caldwell addresses that question on his FAQ page:  The holograms were made by a premier manufacturer who understands they are in the business of making tamper-evident labels, and it looks to me like they did a really good job. It's pretty difficult to remove the hologram without exposing an obvious ""honeycomb"" tamper evident pattern. The tamper pattern is extremely sensitive and not concealable once exposed - so sensitive in fact, I ruin over 10% of the holograms just preparing the coins and have to discard them. I don't know of a way, and I'd be interested to hear if you do.  What does a Casascius look like?  Most look like coins, though there is one denomination that resembles a gold bar:  A ฿0.5 Casascius coin is a brass coin with a one-inch (25.4 mm) diameter.  A ฿1 Casascius coin is a brass coin that’s1.125 inches (28.6 mm) in diameter (just bigger than a US quarter but smaller than a half-dollar) and weighs a quarter ounce.  The ฿25 Casascius coin was minted only in 2011, although it is available for sale. Each coin is about 1.75 inches (44.5 mm) in diameter, around 0.114 inches (2.9 mm) thick and weighs about 1.2 ounces. Combined with the heft, the gold electroplating makes this an impressive-looking coin.  The Casascius 2-Factor Gold-Plated Savings Bar looks like a small gold bar: its dimensions are 8 mm x 40mm x 6mm. If it were made of solid gold rather than a gold-plated metal alloy, it would weigh a substantial 12 ounces … instead of its actual weight of 4.2 ounces. The bar is available as a pre-loaded 100 BTC bar or as a non-denominated savings bar. It includes two-factor encryption.  Where and how can Casascius coins be purchased?  You can buy them online, either with bitcoins or using other forms of payment.  Bitcoins are the only accepted form of payment for Casascius coins on Caldwell’s website. However, other forms of payment are accepted elsewhere, at sites like eBay, BitMit, MemoryDealers, HardBTC.org (UK), Bittiraha.fi (Finland), microbitcoin.frhttp://microbitcoin.fr/ (France) and BitInnovate.com (Australia).  Is it true that Caldwell stopped taking orders in April 2013?  Yes, but he has since begun taking orders again (he announced this on April 28).  Caldwell has announced some other changes in pricing, batches and delivery options for his 2013 coins:  He has made 8,000 one-BTC token blanks with the year 2013 (and adds he might make more if the coins run out in the middle of the year).  He’s adding a 0.5-BTC coin. “This coin is the same style in every way, but is one inch instead of 1.125 inches in diameter,” Caldwell states, adding, “This is being added due to the rise in bitcoin value. The pricing will be the same as the one-BTC coin (other than being 0.5 BTC less).” The 0.5-BTC coin has a sticker with the same design as the one-BTC coin, only a big smaller.  Caldwell expects 8,000 0.5-BTC token blanks to be delivered soon.  Both the 0.5-BTC and one-BTC coins this year feature a slightly different shape for the private key paper. A lobe has been added to the top edge of the circle to help with orientation.  Caldwell says he has “securely generated 19,800 new addresses intended for these two sets of coins, all starting with a prefix of ‘12’ or ‘13’.” The “13” prefix will designate one-BTC coins, while the “12” prefix will be for 0.5-BTC coins.  How can anyone know the digital keys aren’t copied or used to perpetuate a bitcoin scam?  Caldwell says he puts his own name on the line for that.  He gives his word that he controls the private keys during coin manufacture – inserting them personally or supervising those who do – and asserts that he does not keep any of them. It’s really a matter of accepting him at his word:  I have given out my real-world identity and have digitally signed a list of the bitcoin addresses used in this project. I have made it so that it if I were to perpetrate a scam, it would be possible to prove it and to hold me legally accountable – something no scammer wants to do. You should demand the same from anyone handling your cryptocurrency.  Caldwell has also published a Statement of Controls to answer questions people might have about the integrity of Casascius physical bitcoins. The statement includes details about the coins’ production and funding.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT,Ariella Brown,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/05/09/whats-a-casascius-coin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a9a51857231806a82ee4c459244903be2b2ddb04-628x356.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376454,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6Adwx,1368094021,What other digital currencies are there?,"Bitcoin might currently be getting the lion’s share of media attention, as far as digital currencies go. But it’s not the only form of electronic money being mined, traded and spent.  Let’s meet some of the other digital currencies making the rounds online:  BBQCoin  According to the Bitcoin Forum, bbqcoin was “forgotten after (a) 51% attack on launch, now revived and active … super fast version of LTC (litecoin).”The site’s operator – Bitcoin Forum user CaptChadd – launched a new bbqcoin thread on the forum on May 7, 2013, concluding his message by saying, “I consider BQC to no longer be a joke but a real cryptocurrency only with a dry and sarcastic sense of humour … and a great taste. J”  Chinacoin  Making its debut in early May 2013, chinacoin (CNC) is a litecoin-based currency that uses the scrypt password-based key derivation function. It’s produced in 60-second blocks with 88 coins per block at the moment. That amount is expected to halve after 2,628,000 blocks (about five years), with the difficulty of mining retargeted every 5,040 blocks. Chinacoin is designed to generate no more than 462.5 million coins. Prices can be tracked at BTC-e.  DevCoin  Described as a bitcoin fork, devcoin was designed as an “ethically inspired project … to help fund open-source projects created by programmers, hardware developers, writers, musicians, painters, graphic artists and filmmakers.” While devcoin is based on bitcoin, mining the currency is much easier. Each new block generated provides 5,000 devcoins to the miner and 45,000 coins to developers, writers and other participants (a 10/90 split). Devcoins are generated at a rate of 50,000 coins per block “forever”. With an average of 144 blocks per day, that means around 7.2 million new devcoins per day.  Feathercoin  An open-source currency based on litecoin, feathercoin (FTC) made its debut in April 2013. Like litecoin, feathercoin is mined using a scrypt-based hashing algorithm, which can be solved with GPU hardware rather than the more costly ASIC hardware (now the mining hardware of choice for bitcoins). Where litecoin will ultimately produce 84 million coins, feathercoin has a hard limit of 336 million coins. The block reward for successful feathercoin miners is currently 200 coins, with the reward halved every 840,000 blocks (with about one block every 2.5 minutes). Feathercoin prices are tracked by the exchanges BTC-e, Vircurex, Cryptonit and Bter.  Groupcoin  Groupcoin was devcoin’s predecessor. It was designed as a fallback currency in case devcoin didn’t turn out as planned. Groupcoin generates 50 coins per block “forever”.  Ixcoin  Ixcoin is described as a bitcoin-based peer-to-peer currency with a shorter maturity. It’s generated at 96 ixcoins per block, with the same hard limit – 21 million coins – as bitcoin. However, it’s not one of the more active cryptocurrencies at the moment: Its page on GitHub has shown no recent activity, its Tweets indicate the site has struggled repeated to remain up and online, and its web pages (other than the home page) show only an error message. A number of users posting recently on the Bitcoin Forum’s Alternate Cryptocurrencies section have essentially said they’re giving up on the currency.  Litecoin  Like its younger cousin feathercoin, litecoin (LTC) is designed to be easier to mine than bitcoin, as it requires a scrypt-based proof of work that makes mining possible with GPUs rather than ASICs. Litecoins have a hard limit of 84 million coins (four times bitcoin’s ultimate limit), and transactions can be verified more quickly than bitcoin transactions: 2.5 minutes vs. 10 minutes. Litecoin miners are rewarded with 50 new coins per block. Litecoins are traded on four exchanges: BTC-e, Vircurex, Omnicoins and VXBTC.com.  Namecoin  Like many of the other alternative cryptocurrencies described here, namecoin (NMC) is based on bitcoin technology. Unlike the other currencies, namecoin is an alternative, decentralized, peer-to-peer DNS (domain name system) as well as a currency. Whether as a currency or a DNS, however, it is not currently widely used.  Novacoin  Novacoin is described as a “hybrid scrypt proof-of-work- and proof-of-stake-based cryptocurrency.” Under its existing coding, it has a hard limit of 2 billion coins; however, that limit can be lifted if needed. Novacoin is similar to ppcoin, but uses as “slightly different emission model”. The currency can be traded on Vircurex.  Ripple  Ripple Labs Inc  is the organization behind ripple, which is not a digital currency, but an open-source, peer-to-peer payment network. As described on the Bitcoin Forum, ripple XRP (called “ripples”) is an innovative IOU exchange rather than a coin.  PPcoin  Another project forked from bitcoin, ppcoin (PPC) is designed to “keep as much as possible the original bitcoin’s preferable properties.” Launched in 2012, it was also created to be “the first long-term energy-efficient cryptocurrency.” Instead of proof-of-work, ppcoin is mined using proof-of-stake ... which essentially uses the currency itself to protect the network. PPcoin doesn’t have a hard limit like bitcoin, but is patterned to mimic gold’s natural scarcity: an inflation rate of about 1 percent through proof-of-stake minting is balanced by a built-in destruction of transaction fees.  Terracoin  Another digital currency based on bitcoin, terrcoin (TRC) is designed to end up with no more than 42 million coins and boasts a transaction confirmation time of 120 seconds. The initial block reward for mining is 20 terracoins, with that amount cut in half every 1,050,000 blocks (around four years). First mined in October 2012, the currency has experienced some recent troubles – hashing power spikes, troubles with difficulty retargeting, etc. – but has undergone fixes and continues to be traded on Vircurex and a few other exchanges.  Ven  Created by Stan Stalnaker, Ven is a global digital currency designed to enable commerce among members of Hub Culture, Stalnaker’s business club for international travelers, movers and shakers. Ven was launched in 2007 and is backed 100 percent by reserve funds, which is aimed at minimizing the risk of inflation. The basket of commodities and currencies that Ven is pegged to includes carbon, making Ven “a stable currency that supports the environment,” Stalnaker says. Major banks such as Citibank have purchased Ven for in-house use, and the currency is indexed by Thomson Reuters.  Zen  Pegged to a basket of 22 international currencies, zen is basically an “anti-bitcoin” ... linked to fiat values and “designed specifically not to rise or fall dramatically in value.” The reaction from bitcoin fans has been underwhelming so far: “kinda limited in my opinion, probably similar to Amazon coins,” noted one member of the Bitcoin Forum.",NEUTRAL,BTC | LTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | FIAT | LTC | MINING,Shirley Siluk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/05/09/what-other-digital-currencies-are-there,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/008b00a429793d198a41956bfc4ff57395df1a16-628x356.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376460,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6Ae71,1368091409,New apps track bitcoin price swings,"Bitcoin’s volatility can be a challenge for traders. It’s a fast-moving market and, unless you’re in front of your computer 24/7, you can’t really keep up with price movements.  As with all things bitcoin, though, things in this area change quickly. A couple of new products on the market aim to help traders stay up to date with digital currency prices.  Go Bit Go’s  free service will notify you by text or email when the price of your chosen currency hits a pre-selected value. As well as bitcoin, Go Bit Go supports litecoin, novacoin, teracoin and other digital currencies using live data from BTC-E, Mt. Gox and Vircurex.  “You still have to rely on your own trading skills to make money, but at least now you can be sure to be notified when the market moves, and you can get some sleep at night,” the company stated.  Taking a slightly different approach, CoinCliff offers a smartphone app that works like an alarm clock, notifying users of pre-selected changes in bitcoin prices. As well as alarms, the app can be set for regular notifications, such as the one displayed when text messages are received.  CoinCliff uses data from Mt. Gox, but has plans to add prices from other exchanges such as BTC-E and Bitcoin-central. The company is offering a free, 24-hour trial for the app, which can be purchased for 0.09 bitcoin.  It is likely that some of these alert services will use the CoinDesk bitcoin price.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | LTC | MARKET | TRADING,Doug Watt,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/05/09/new-apps-track-bitcoin-price-swings,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5259412e922e415e5bed313f6839e2e1d63184db-960x960.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
