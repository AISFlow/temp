42377898,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73rQZ,1417637719,"LibertyX Brings Bitcoin Buying to 2,500 US Retail Stores","Liberty Teller, the bitcoin ATM operator that manages machines in high-profile locations near US universities like Harvard and MIT, has officially rebranded as LibertyX, expanding its network with 2,500 new bitcoin buying locations in 33 US states.  The announcement marks a dramatic expansion for the Boston-based company, which has partnered with transaction processing specialist Qpay to launch cash-for-bitcoin buying services at mobile phone and convenience stores around the country. LibertyX manages four ATM machines, but sees this new partnership as a way to expand and innovate its business.  LibertyX co-founder Chris Yim explained that his company, which was accepted into the MassChallenge startup accelerator this summer, will now seek to shift away from bitcoin ATMs, more broadly embracing a variety of cash-for-bitcoin channels.  Yim told CoinDesk:  ""If you look at our Harvard [bitcoin ATM] location, it's very high volume, high traffic, it makes sense because you have a lot of people coming in and out. But, the US is extremely large geographically, and we want to make sure that you can buy bitcoin as conveniently as you can go to your local bank.""  Yim went on to suggest that the new partnership would allow LibertyX to offer the lowest-cost cash option for bitcoin buying, as the involvement of retail stores limits the overhead that can come with leasing space for a dedicated bitcoin ATM.  He added that the service will be fee-free for new users at launch to encourage enrollment.  Making a purchase  To buy bitcoin at LibertyX's new retail partner locations, consumers must set up a user account online, linking their phone number and providing details such as their name and date of birth.  Users who want to purchase bitcoin can then enter their zip code, which will in turn bring up an interactive map of LibertyX's nearby locations.  The website features a step-by-step tutorial advising new users on how to interact at the point of sale. Purchases can be made in increments of $50, $100, $200 or $300. In return, users receive a PIN number that they then enter into the LibertyX website, at which time LibertyX sends the purchased bitcoin to the user's wallet.  Yim downplayed the notion that retail employees could be confused with the process at checkout.  ""In terms of what the dealer actually does, they're providing the cash channel, accepting the cash,"" he said. ""Bitcoin redemption, user signup – that all happens on our site.""  Embracing traditional finance  More broadly, Yim explained that he sees bitcoin's ATM sector as providing a necessary onramp to bitcoin today, though he suggested he sees this importance diminishing over time.  ""I think that bitcoin is a great add-on and should be integrated into all ATMs. It doesn't make sense to have a new machine when all that's required is additional lines of code,"" he said.  Yim went on to suggest that ATM providers that embrace bitcoin may gain a new way to increase their revenue streams, an idea that has been proposed by trade groups such as the Electronic Funds Transfer Association (EFTA) and the ATM Industry Association (ATMIA).  Yim concluded that LibertyX aims to position itself to capitalize on this transition, concluding:  ""I for one would love to work with any ATM or banking partners that are looking to deploy this.""

42377870,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73rDz,1417636928,"Amazon, Walmart and Western Union BitLicense Comments Revealed","The New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) has today made public over 3,700 comments it received regarding its BitLicense proposal. The move provides new insight into the organisations and individuals that have taken an interest in the proposed regulation.  Perhaps most notably, the full release included submissions from some of the largest businesses in the US, including e-commerce giant Amazon, retail juggernaut Walmart and global remittance specialist Western Union.  The filings suggest that the BitLicense is being interpreted broadly by the legal representatives of these companies, and that greater clarity is needed by the NYDFS to indicate the entities and financial products covered under the measure.  For example, Amazon and Walmart's filings took aim at what they consider the ""broad definition of virtual currency"" to which the proposed regulation would apply in current form.  Amazon suggested  the wording could be read as applicable to some of its own products, particularly closed-loop digital payment methods, prepaid value cards and prepaid cards denominated in fiat currency. Similarly, Walmart advocated for the addition of phrasing that would clearly exempt gift cards.  Clarity and oversight  By comparison, Western Union submitted a much lengthier comment on the proposal, arguing that more oversight should be given to bitcoin ATM kiosks, and that more clarity should be added to the document to specify what indirect financial activities would be considered as supportive of virtual currency transmission.  ""It is unclear whether operators of kiosks would be required to be separately licensed as a VC licensee, or whether any oversight or other requirements would be imposed on the physical locations that host kiosks or on the operations of the kiosks themselves,"" the filing reads.  Further, Western Union expressed its interest that businesses that fall under the BitLicense be made to comply with all existing anti-money laundering (AML) requirements in addition to any new measures necessary given the risks associated with virtual currency transmission.  ""Western Union believes that the NYDFS' additional AML requirements for virtual currency transactions should mirror current federal AML requirements for fiat currency transactions,"" the filing reads. ""This approach would permit VC Licensees to draw upon existing federal regulatory guidance and the knowledge of AML compliance personnel for purposes of determining how to comply with such requirements, where applicable.""  The release follows superintendent Benjamin M Lawsky's November keynote address at the Money2020 conference in Las Vegas, and the many formal comments previously published in full by companies in the bitcoin space.

42377869,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73rCj,1417630557,Top Dutch Banks Confirm Blockchain Experiments,"Three Dutch banks have announced that they are experimenting with blockchain technology as a way of improving their payments systems.  That ING, ABN Amro and Rabobank are all testing the technology was aired last Monday in a segment on the Netherland's popular RTL evening news.  ING  's global head of transaction services Mark Buitenhek (pictured) told RTL that his bank has been improving on technology that was built in the '70s and '80s, explaining:  “We have improved the speed of transactions since then, up to where we are today,"" he said. ""As such, we are always looking out for the latest technological breakthroughs to improve this even further. This is why ING is testing blockchain technology.”  ING spokesman Robert Gunther added the company is always trying to innovate and improve the speed and utility of money transfers for customers.  Framing the blockchain technology underlying bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a potential way to advance payment services, Gunther said:  ""By using bitcoin technology, banks might be able to update customer accounts within seconds. The question now is whether this would indeed be possible, and if so, at what risks. Apart from the functionality, our focus will always be on security as well.”  Combining bank security with bitcoin  ABN Amro  's experiments with bitcoin have been public knowledge for a couple of months, having been revealed in the Dutch technology news source AutomatiseringGids.  Menno van Leeuwen, the team leader at the bank's Innovation Centre, was quoted as saying:  “Banks are faced with competitors from outside of the traditional financial sector, who come up with new solutions. If we ignore these developments, that might lead to surprises, which is undesirable ... As banks, we have a lot experience in the field of providing customers with security, and we're currently testing the combination with bitcoin.”  Rabobank  official Wiebe Draijer also acknowledged his bank's interest in blockchain technology on the RTL show.  “There's a lot of developments happening with [blockchain] technology,"" he said. ""It's interesting to see what kind of feature this holds, and whether it will influence the banking system.”  RTL confirmed that Rabobank is testing blockchain technology, including bitcoin, although a spokesperson told CoinDesk that the bank is not interested in using bitcoin directly – either its currency or network – but is interested in researching how the technology works.  Additionally, at SWIFT's InnoTRIBE conference (see a video), a Rabobank official stated that the institution is also experimenting with the Ripple payments network.  Limited central bank approval  It is still unclear exactly what kind of experiments the banks are conducting at this point, and to what extent they are considering the integration of bitcoin.  There is also the issue of how far such experiments would be allowed to progress by the country's financial authorities.  The Dutch central bank (DNB) warned the nation's financial institutions of the risks involved with dealing in bitcoin last June, and stated that it does not consider bitcoin a viable alternative to fiat currency.  While reaffirming the DNB's stance on bitcoin, central bank spokesman Martijn Pols indicated it does approve of experimentation with blockchain technology.  “We are not in charge of everything banks do, and we are happy to let them experiment with any technology that might innovate their payment services,” he said.  “But Dutch banks won't actually be using bitcoin themselves in any way,"" he continued. ""We still hold our initial position as released in June of this year, in which we classified virtual currencies as products with a very high-risk profile, and because of the anonymous features, a high-integrity risk.”  Although this initial position was mostly based on bitcoin in its role as a currency and not so much the payments network, Pols excludes the possibility of banks using the latter as well.  Dutch banks, he said, are allowed to learn from bitcoin, are free to experiment with blockchain technology and are even encouraged to integrate similar technologies into their own payment services.  Pols concluded, however:  ""It is absolutely out of the question that these banks will transfer money over the actual bitcoin blockchain out of reach from the Dutch central bank.”  Mark Buitenhek (of ING) image via RTN Nieuws",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Aaron van Wirdum,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/12/03/top-dutch-banks-confirm-blockchain-experiments,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bcdb00da89e77391c969d16e31d6b749833082de-1280x731.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377882,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73rUL,1417619723,Bitcoin Price Decline Sparks Rare Mining Difficulty Drop,"Bitcoin mining difficulty has decreased for the first time in two years. The minor 0.62% drop was observed yesterday and currently stands at 40,007,470,271, down from 40,300,030,238.  The difficulty level crossed the 40,000,000,000 mark late last month, peaking after several consecutive quarters of rapid growth. The 1,000,000,000 milestone was passed last December, while the last difficulty drop was recorded back in late 2012.  Mining difficulty determines how difficult it is to hash a new block and varies based on the amount of computing power used by miners on the bitcoin network. Bitcoin’s growing popularity has attracted more computing power to the network, meaning that the difficulty has been steadily increasing for some time.  However, stagnant pricing has caused a reduction in the hash rate over the past few weeks, resulting in the slight difficulty decrease. The estimated next difficulty level is 39,884,219,890, or -0.31%.  Hash rate decline  The sheer size of the bitcoin network ensures resilience and stability, but the hash rate has been stagnant for weeks and started declining in the first days of December.  The hash rate at press time, according to Blockchain, was 244,405,696 GH/s, but in recent days it has hovered in the 280-290-billion GH/s range. The network is still oversized given the average daily volume of bitcoin transactions, so stability and security are not a concern.  The drop in difficulty and hash rate was expected due to depressed bitcoin prices. CoinDesk examined the issue in a feature three months ago, concluding that difficulty could reverse if prices do not recover.  The advent of more efficient ASICs, coupled with low bitcoin prices, has obviously rendered a lot of mining hardware obsolete, prompting operators to pull the plug on older, less efficient facilities.  Faster chips and cheaper electricity are slowing down the decline, but they cannot stop it unless the price starts moving up – effectively, the market regulates miners' behaviour.  Guy Corem, CEO of ASIC-designer Spondoolies-Tech explained:  ""Under the current bitcoin value, mining gear efficiency of 0.5–0.7 J/GH range and energy cost, we'll reach equilibrium very soon.""  In layman's terms, with bitcoin prices in the sub-$400 range, mining at a difficulty level of 40,000,000,000-plus simply does not make economic sense with current-generation hardware.  Zhenya Tsvetnenko, executive chairman of digitalBTC, told CoinDesk:  ""Cost and availability of power is the major limiting factor on mining. Power costs obviously have a natural lower limit and, unlike cost of hardware or power efficiency of hardware, cannot keep halving – no matter how efficiently sourced. Given this limit, we have expected difficulty would slow down in the short term or even go backwards as we have seen.""  Reversing the trend  The network is reaching equilibrium and one of two things need to happen in order to reverse the negative output trend – the bitcoin price needs to go up or the cost of mining needs to go down.  Bitcoin mining is a capital-intensive industry with very fast turnover. Few miners can afford to hold freshly mined coins for long, hence they are usually sold at market price, even if this means the operators incurs a small loss. Profit simply has to be reinvested quickly in order to maintain competitiveness.  Should the price recover, we can expect more investment in additional capacity and, if the gain is big enough, currently uncompetitive hardware could be put back to productive use. However, it is nearly impossible to predict bitcoin price trends and this factor remains an unknown.  As far as hardware goes, stagnation breeds increased competitiveness, as miners and ASIC designers have to make more with less. That is to say, with less investment and fewer people willing to pre-order new hardware, development will inevitably slow down. This favours bigger and better-funded hardware makers capable of investing in R&D without having to rely on the pre-order model.  Tsvetnenko was upbeat about the future however, saying:  ""Moving to the medium to longer term, new generations of more efficient mining chips will likely see difficulty resume its growth slowly.""  High cost of ASIC development  Until now, ASIC designers tended to use mature nodes for their designs, enabling easier development, cheaper manufacturing and faster time-to-market.  However, strong competition and over-investment have prompted many miners to announce 20nm and 16nm FinFET nodes this year.  This is the first time bitcoin ASICs have had to transition to completely new nodes rather than use proven and mature manufacturing nodes like 28nm.  Developing, taping out and manufacturing chips for these cutting edge nodes is more capital intensive than for mature nodes (such as 28nm, 65nm etc). So, unless prices and demand for new hardware go up, smaller outfits will have a hard time securing enough funding to transition to new FinFET nodes.  Due to a number of technical and economic reasons, the planar 20nm node will be skipped by most chipmakers, including ASIC designers.  This trend obviously favours bigger manufacturers, who have the resources to design, tapeout and order FinFET parts. The first products based on FinFET nodes are expected in the first half of the year, but, in an industry plagued by delays, it is difficult to ascertain exact timeframes for new ASIC rollouts.  If all goes well, we should see the first ASIC's manufactured on TSMC's 16nm FinFET node sometime in the second quarter of 2015, followed by 14nm FinFET designs manufactured by the Samsung-GlobalFoundries alliance roughly a quarter later.  These costly next-generation designs, using the latest non-planar manufacturing processes, could in theory deliver a quantum leap in performance and power efficiency, sparking the next round in the bitcoin ASIC arms race. However, in the process they could also spell the end of many small bitcoin hardware makers and render yet more hardware obsolete.

42377878,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73rPJ,1417615217,Winklevoss Capital Launches Investor Syndicate with an Eye on Bitcoin,"Winklevoss Capital  , the family office led by two of the largest known holders of bitcoin – brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss – has officially launched an AngelList syndicate that will broadly focus on tech companies, possibly including promising digital currency startups.  Announced in September and launched on 25th November, the syndicate has amassed 21 backers to date, including AngelList CEO and co-founder Naval Ravikant, serial investor Bill Lee and ex-head of Google Express Tom Fallows.  Winklevoss Capital principal Tyler Winklevoss indicated that, while not broadly advertised in the initial launch promotion, the AngelList syndicate will consider bitcoin and blockchain-focused companies for potential investment.  Winklevoss told CoinDesk:  ""Our long-term thesis has been and continues to be that bitcoin and blockchain technology are going to prove to be two of the most significant and pervasive technologies the world has ever seen.""  Winklevoss also opened up about their company's larger investment strategy, which arguably proved conservative in 2014 when compared to more active investors in the bitcoin ecosystem.  Notably, Winklevoss spoke out against aggressive bitcoin investment approaches, perhaps hinting at the strategy both his firm and the syndicate will adopt in 2015.  ""Our goal as investors is to earn meaningful returns, not participation medals,"" Winklevoss said. ""Blindly investing in every bitcoin company strikes me as the marketing-PR tail wagging the economic dog.""  Winklevoss Capital  is also an investor in AngelList, the early-stage investment platform that has so far raised $24.1m in VC funding.  The infrastructure phase  In contrast to some of his more recent, loftier presentations that have focused on advanced blockchain applications and autonomous economies, Winklevoss struck a decidedly measured chord when speaking about his investment strategy.  While he acknowledged that Winklevoss Capital and its new syndicate could invest in projects that help the ecosystem advance toward its full potential, he asserted his belief that bitcoin's business community first requires more basic investments.  ""The current venture investment opportunities generally remain in the core ecosystem – bitcoin the asset – and the infrastructure layer companies – merchant processors, compliance processors, vaults or storage systems, exchanges, miners, investment vehicles, tax reporting providers – but will eventually shift towards the application layer companies,"" he said.  Once these investments are provided, an ecosystem that goes beyond single use cases such as buying and selling bitcoin, he said, can develop. Still, he framed infrastructure investments as crucial to this larger goal.  ""We will start to see companies facilitating use-case scenarios that were simply not possible before the emergence of bitcoin. This application layer phase will really start to unleash the power of bitcoin and blockchain technology,"" he said.  Anticipating growth  Winklevoss also cited his company's public investments as evidence that the kind of big-picture strategy is already being deployed by Winklevoss Capital.  In particular, he noted the firm's investments in bitcoin services provider Xapo, file storage network Filecoin; two-factor authentication provider Authy; and Matternethttp://matternet.us/, a transportation network for drones, as examples of investments that show the range of opportunities his firm has so far pursued.  Winklevoss suggested that he sees a synergy between even these seemingly disparate projects, noting how Matternet drones could one day be hired and paid for with bitcoin.  However, he cautioned that, above all, Winklevoss Capital and its new syndicate will seek to time its deals in the space in line with its expectations for this growth.  ""Web 2.0 applications could not have been built, let alone have succeeded, before a critical mass of users had been on-boarded with broadband Internet connections, which couldn’t have happened before infrastructure companies like Cisco [and] Telecoms built the routers and switches and laid the fiber that combined to form the backbone of the Internet.""  He added:  ""Facebook could not have come before Google and so on. The same is true for bitcoin.""  Flexible deal count  Although the official AngelList syndicate page indicates that Winklevoss Capital will seek to fund five deals per year, Winklevoss indicated this investment figure is likely to depend on a host of hard-to-predict factors.  Still, he suggested that given that bitcoin is likely to play a significant role in tech investments in the coming year, the AngelList syndicate's activity can be expected to reflect larger trends.  ""There's a good chance we will be running more than five syndicates per year,"" he said.  Further, he suggested that Winklevoss Capital will pursue some investments independently of the syndicate, should they be unable to secure this allocation.  He also pledged transparency to participants, noting: ""Our backers can message us at any time and we will do our best to respond.""  Backer sentiment toward bitcoin  Winklevoss went on to address the potential views of participants in the AngelList syndicate regarding the bitcoin ecosystem, suggesting that the nature of the AngelList platform makes any definitive conclusions difficult to pin down.  One of the benefits of AngelList, Winklevoss argued, is that it allows like-minded investors to connect without geographical constraint. ""Some of our backers we know offline, but most of them we do not,"" he said.  Still, Winklevoss suggested that his firm's highly vocal stance toward bitcoin is likely to be reflected among investors, concluding:  ""While we don’t know their thoughts on the bitcoin ecosystem and its opportunities firsthand, we imagine many of our backers are interested in bitcoin and the other types of deals we have done, and they look forward to taking a look at our overall syndicate deal flow in the future.""  Winklevoss noted that AngelList syndicate backers simply get first priority to participate in investments and are not obligated to support every completed deal.

42377873,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73rKH,1417604683,"Bitcoin, Stellar and Sidechains Feature at Future of Money Summit","The fifth annual Future of Money & Technology Summit brought together both bitcoin believers and traditional financial industry experts at the Hotel Kabuki in San Francisco on Monday.  Organizer Brian Zisk said more than 500 people in total came to the event to learn more about how innovation, both within the bitcoin ecosystem and beyond, is changing the finance industry.  While primarily focused on traditional financial technology, the summit featured a dedicated digital currency track that saw discussion on issues as diverse as bitcoin mining centralization and sidechains – a system for experimentation within bitcoin itself.  Overall, the conference proved to be an interesting mix of traditional finance expertise and those looking to build platforms to innovate in distributed ways, with conversations that reflected the ever-evolving space of digital currencies and entrepreneurship.  Importance of emerging markets  The most popular cryptocurrency-related session was one simply titled 'Bitcoin'.  The panelists taking part were Boost VC’s Adam Draper, 500 Startups’ Sean Percival, dogecoin founder Jackson Palmer and BitPay Chief Commercial Officer Sonny Singh. Moderating was Mark Rogowsky, a tech journalist at Forbes.  Draper conceded that bitcoin would need emerging markets to really take off, because the US doesn’t need digital currency innovation because of its strong banking system.  Draper told the audience:  “The US is the worst place for bitcoin to take off. But that is not true in all parts of the world.”  He noted that places where bank account adoption is only 10% but cellphone adoption is 90% are ripe for cryptocurrency adoption.  Even so, it’s just not that easy to get bitcoin in those places yet, as BitPay’s Singh pointed out. “It’s got to be easier to use bitcoin, and for people to get bitcoin. It’s much harder in developing countries to get bitcoin.”  Palmer, whose dogecoin alternative cryptocurrency creation is nearing its one-year milestone, believes younger generations will pick up on digital money with relative ease.  “I think it’s about changing the mindshare. The older generation is attached to hard, cold cash,” Palmer said.  Focus on the blockchain and Stellar  Two other panels that featured interesting digital currency discussions focused on blockchain technology and Stellar – a virtual currency forked from Ripple Labs.  The blockchain panel placed an emphasis on the further consolidation of the mining industry.  Bitcoin core developer and Blockstream co-founder Gregory Maxwell conceded that the consolidation of bitcoin mining is simply part of the economics of cryptocurrencies. ”There are some advantages of scale in mining,” he told the audience.  An entire panel was dedicated to Stellar, launched this summer and still just three months old.  Moderated by investor Dan Rosen, the panelists were Stripe CTO Greg Brockman and Stellar founders Joyce Kim and Jed McCaleb.  Brockman, whose company Stripe invested $3m in Stellar, believes bitcoin has some issues that need to be worked out, something he outlined earlier this year on his company’s official blog.  “I think there’s a lot of good stuff in the bitcoin community, [but] I think there are some shortcomings,” he told the audience.  The future of money  The conference’s one-day schedule concluded with a panel that featured investors talking about where monetary technology might be headed.  Called 'Visions of the Future of Money', the panel included investor and BitFury board member Bill Tai, Ribbit Capital’s Nick Shalek and Pantera Capital CEO Dan Morehead. John Shinal from USA Today moderated the session.  Morehead, whose Pantera Capital invests solely in digital currency startups, was bullish on the concept of sidechains as a way to enable new cryptocurrency developmental projects.  Although Pantera did not invest, sidechains is a project being spearheaded by Blockstream, which recently raised $21m.  “Sidechains is one of the most important innovations in bitcoin,” Morehead said. “There’s billions of dollars in bitcoin, you can’t just throw things at the wall and hope they stick.”  While there were many portions of The Future of Money devoted solely to financial technology, the presence of a room dedicated solely to digital currencies is a sign that bitcoin is increasingly being seen as intriguing by members of the financial community, and potentially influencing the industry.  Shalek, the Ribbit Capital partner, told the audience during the closing panel:  “Bitcoin has this promise of enabling innovation. There are already 10 million people or more using bitcoin.”  Images via Dan Cawrey/CoinDesk",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | DOGE | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/12/03/bitcoin-stellar-and-sidechains-feature-at-future-of-money-summit,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a6789398cc527a90809e048ddee5359102901700-1380x669.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377864,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73r7h,1417591754,Australian Federal Investigators Look at Bitcoin's Organized Crime Role,"One of Australia's primary national law enforcement agencies, the Australian Crime Commission (ACC), is investigating bitcoin's role in organized crime in an official operation known as 'Project Longstrike'.  According to a report published by Reuters earlier today, ACC Executive Director Judy Lind said that investigators were aware of and would be monitoring ""misuse of virtual currencies to facilitate criminal activity.""  She said:  ""Organized crime groups continue to make use of darknets to harbor trading in illicit commodities, including child exploitation material, illicit drugs and firearms, stolen credit card and identity data, and hacking techniques.""  The ACC is Australia’s national criminal intelligence and investigative agency, concerned mainly with major organized crime including drugs, money laundering, terrorism and corruption.  Warming environment  The ACC's latest announcement comes as Australia's politicians and regulators have recently begun to warm to bitcoin, and the country's prospects as an innovation leader in developing the new technology.  The Australian Tax Office issued guidelines in August detailing how it would tax bitcoin use for businesses and individuals.  A Senate inquiry, which held its first hearings just last week, has heard mainly positive testimony regarding digital currency's promise and has invited all interested parties to submit recommendations for its consideration.  One negative voice of note belonged to Mastercard, whose inquiry cited bitcoin and Ripple as two predominant digital currencies and warned of bitcoin's volatility, anonymity, facilitation of illegal activities and lack of consumer protections as arguments for greater regulation.  Not the first time  This is actually not the first time the ACC has taken an interest in bitcoin. The agency referred to bitcoin and its ""anonymous"" nature three times in its Organized Crime in Australia 2013 report, saying:  ""The unregulated environment and the anonymity of transactions make currencies such as bitcoin attractive to organised crime for money laundering.""  In June 2013, the ACC's acting chief executive Paul Jevtovic also cited bitcoin's ""anonymity"" in a newspaper interview, saying: ""The ACC is currently working with partners to explore the bitcoin market and other digital currencies, to better understand its size and criminal threat"".  Bitcoin industry view  Jason Williams, president of local Bitcoin Foundation chapter the Australian Bitcoin Association, told CoinDesk that bitcoin offers the world many advantages beyond semi-anonymous payments. These include financial inclusion for more people, overall cost of payments and the security of a financial supply that cannot be tampered with.  As for bitcoin's role in crime, he said:  ""Financial crime will continue irrespective of the financial system involved. It is important to realise that as with anything new, there is both an adoption and learning curve and that bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are not immune to police action.""  Australia and dark markets  Despite the ACC's concerns, Australia remains one of the world's toughest destinations for illegal goods shipments. Several online dark marketplaces and forums have warned the country's Customs Service is particularly effective at intercepting unlawful packages and some vendors will not ship there at all.  Just last week, the Australian government extradited Brisbane resident Peter Nash to face trial in the US over his alleged role as 'primary moderator' of the original Silk Road marketplace, which was shuttered by the FBI in October last year.  In October this year, Queensland police seized the state's first bitcoin ATM from a coffee shop as part of a drug bust, though it has never been ascertained whether the machine was in any way involved in illegal activity.  Another alleged Silk Road participant, Richard Pollard, had 24,500 BTC seized by the state of Victoria, which the Department of Justice is reportedly planning to sell at auction.  Formed in 2003, the Australian Crime Commission is a federal agency ""empowered to conduct special investigations and special operations where conventional law enforcement methods are unable or unlikely to be effective. This includes the use of coercive powers.""  These powers include the ability to summons witnesses and compel them to provide evidence about themselves or others, and to seize any documents relevant to an investigation.
