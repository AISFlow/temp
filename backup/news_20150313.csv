42378080,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7M245,1426261761,"Survey: Is the Bitcoin Community Just Young, White and Male?","UPDATE (16th March, 15:20 GMT): This survey is now also available in Chinese and also in Spanish and in Japanese.      It’s a common observation: the bitcoin community largely consists of young, white males. But to what degree is this actually true? Just what percentage of those interested in digital currency matches this description?  To find out, CoinDesk has launched a new survey to determine who exactly makes up the bitcoin community and the demographics with a general interest in digital currency.  The survey only takes a couple of minutes to complete, but will lead to a greater understanding of the community.  You can complete the survey below, or in a new tab.  Please also take the time to share this survey. The higher the number of responses we get, the greater the weight of the results.

42378097,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7M2KR,1426255822,Bitcoin in the Headlines: 21 Inc Hits Media Jackpot,"Bitcoin in the Headlines is a weekly look at global bitcoin news, analysing media coverage and its impact.  Complete with staggering funding rounds and mysterious bitcoin startups, this week's news served up an unusually high dose of intrigue. It's safe to say both bitcoin aficionados and naysayers were taken by surprise.  However, the calibre of the headlines wasn't the only notable development.  Beneath the surface, the news was just as captivating and worthy of dissection, with signs that general media outlets are increasingly exploring the notion of bitcoin as a technology, as opposed to just a digital currency. A sign, perhaps, that mainstream conversation may finally be maturing beyond crime and prices.  Mystery startup announces funding  Perhaps the biggest news of the week was the Wall Street Journal's scoop that stealth startup 21 Inc has raised $116m in funding. The impressive feat was all the more head turning as it included some of the biggest names in venture capital – and the media took notice.  At the time of publication, a quick Google search brought up over 40 articles on the funding news.  What was often lost in the press was that the figure was raised over multiple funding rounds, likely dating back as far as 2013. Further, the San Francisco company, while boasting an impressive cast of supporters, is still not yet publicising what it aims to do in the space.  The result was that, in the rush to convey the information (often with brevity), valuable context for how the startup's success compares to others in the ecosystem may been lost.  To some, 21 Inc's big reveal left much to be desired, raising almost as many questions as eyebrows.  Still, the news is positive for the ecosystem as a whole, prompting articles such as one in Fortune entitled, Why March 10 was a big day for bitcoin.  The author went so far to say that 10th March, the day that the secretive startup announced the funding round, should be known as ""Fat Tuesday"", painting the event as a strong contrast to the ""Bloody Sunday"" when major USD bitcoin exchange Bitstamp suffered a serious hack.  Whatever the long-term impact, 21 Inc will surely have the attention of the community as it seeks to justify its validation from investors.  Unlocking net neutrality with bitcoin  Elsewhere, bitcoin was finally getting some good press in the mainstream media.  Peter Van Valkenburgh, director of research at CoinCenter, took on the mighty task of exploring just how bitcoin could potentially unlock net neutrality in a Wired article. How could this be?  Well, the opinion piece cites venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, who recently told The Washington Post:  ""The ultimate answer would be if you had three or four or five broadband providers to every house. Net neutrality is a much less central issue, because if you've got competition, if one of your providers started to screw with you, you'd just switch to another one of your providers.""  This begs the question of how it is actually possible to obtain more 'last-mile' competitors.  The piece notes that last-mile bandwidth remains mostly unused because people only consider two possibilities: opening the connection to everyone, resulting in a potential loss of privacy and the expense, or alternatively, securing it so that only one party can use it.  This is where bitcoin comes in. ""Micropayments and encryption could provide a way out from this trade-off. Efficient micropayments, however, have not been possible before the invention"" of the digital currency, the article notes.  Van Valkenburgh said that those with strong Internet connections will earn more in micropayments as their peers seek to connect through their routers. This would mean that these participants could use part of that revenue to pay for larger data plans or faster web access.  He concluded:  ""The money you earn is your revenue for being a valuable part of the mesh. You are free to pocket some bitcoins, and use others to pay for the connection to the wider Internet or to invest in an even faster connection and better routing hardware.""  ""Eventually, if you’re dealing with a wholesale provider or a particularly progressive telecom, payment for your uplink could also be metered and denominated in bitcoins, and traffic traveling through you from the mesh network could directly pay your provider through an intelligent, bitcoin-accepting modem,"" Van Valkenburgh said.  The director of research finished off by saying:  ""Bitcoin and the low transaction costs that automated micropayments can provide are the keys to building these better markets, which will ultimately unlock net neutrality itself.""

42378094,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7M2Hv,1426245530,Review: Is Purse's Discount Really Worth the Hassle?,"Name: Purse  What it is: A peer-to-peer marketplace that matches individuals wanting to buy items on Amazon at a discount with others wanting to buy bitcoin with a credit card or via PayPal. The service claims discounts of up to 20% for bitcoin shoppers.  Who’s behind it: CEO and co-founder Andrew Lee, previously an advisor for BuyBitcoin.ph and co-founder at Superior Payments Processing LLC, and co-founder and CTO Kent Liu, formerly an engineer at IBM and Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems. (See the full team here.)  Roger Ver  and BTC China's Bobby Lee (also an adviser) are both investors in the company.  Cost: I was charged a £0.06 ($0.09) fee for placing an order equivalent to £6.51 ($9.82), or approximately 1%.  Date launched: December 2014  Summary:Purse touts hefty discounts for people shopping at Amazon via its service, but time delays and complexity ruin the user experience. Additionally, limits on discounts available for new users lower incentive to use the platform.  CoinDesk rating: 2/5  How it works: The service is marketed at people who would like to purchase Amazon items with bitcoin, since the digital currency is currently not accepted by the online retailing giant.  The process is similar to other peer-to-peer marketplace such as Brawker, a site that offers discount shopping at all legitimate retailers.  Purse acts as an intermediary by facilitating a user platform, bitcoin wallet and escrow for completing transactions.  Let's imagine that Alice wants to buy a tablet device from Amazon and get a discount of 8%. In order to do so, she would have to create a wishlist for the item on Amazon and associate it with her delivery address.  Alice would then post her wishlist on Purse, with her desired discount, and upload the cost (equivalent to £100, assuming free delivery) in bitcoin to her escrow wallet address on Purse.  Bob, meanwhile, would like to buy £100-worth of bitcoin with his credit card. He is prepared to pay a premium to be able to do this without having to register with a bitcoin exchange and provide ID and proof of address, thus covering Alice's 8% discount himself.  Bob goes on to purchase the item for Alice from Amazon using his card for £108.  Once the item has been delivered to Alice's address, she notifies the Purse platform and her bitcoin is released from escrow and arrives in Bob's wallet.  This way, both customers have a need fulfilled by Purse's service.  The company makes revenue by charging both parties a small fee.  See the company's explanatory video below:  Purse Promo Video  from PurseIO on Vimeo.  Using the service  Registering  Purse requires users to have an Amazon account.  To register on Purse, consumers are required to provide a user name or email address and a password.  Once the user has signed up to Purse, he or she will have to create an Amazon wishlist.  Amazon automatically creates a wishlist URL, which will need to be imported into Purse.  The user will also have to transfer funds from their personal bitcoin wallet into their Purse-hosted wallet.  Placing an order  Purse enables the user to choose the desired discount of up to 20% once the bitcoin funds have been transferred to its platform.  It is important to note, however, that first-time buyers are limited to a maximum discount of 8%.  Once the level of discount has been selected, the consumer receives a breakdown of the Amazon total, the fee charged by Purse and the total amount saved.  The user can then place the order.  Delivery  Once the order has been placed and accepted by the bitcoin buyer, the user receives a notification at the email address provided during registration.  The bitcoin remains in escrow until the user notifies Purse that the order has been successfully delivered.  Reflecting on the process  I encountered a series of issues with my order, which comprised of some sticky notes and a pack of ball pens.  My order was initially accepted by a buyer, who then rejected it. To try and understand why, I looked on the Purse marketplace page and realised that most smaller offers were still awaiting a buyer.  Two days later, I received a notification stating that another buyer had accepted the order.  The buyer contacted me to let me know that Amazon was only able to ship part of my order – the sticky notes. I was not entirely sure as to why this was the case, but Purse indicated that it had something to do with not selecting third party shipment on Amazon, which I had, as this is set to default.  A 'dispute' was raised for the order, and a tedious exchange of messages between the Amazon buyer, Purse and me began.  Purse confirmed that I would receive a partial delivery and that I would be refunded for the undelivered item.  I received my order approximately a week after the order was placed and proceeded to confirm the shipment so that I could get my refund.  Purse refunded me relatively quickly. However, I was charged a fee of 0.1% for withdrawing my bitcoin back into my Coinbase wallet.  I struggled to understand why a service would charge you for withdrawing funds that have previously been refunded to you. However, a spokesperson from Purse said that this was merely the standard miners' fee – awarded for confirming transactions on the bitcoin network – and was not kept by the platform.  Overall, despite my order arriving in good condition, I was left wondering if the hassle was really worth it for such a small discount.  Pros  Purse offers relatively generous discounts to people wanting to buy Amazon items with bitcoin  Being able to modify the level of discount to attract buyers is a benefit  The service enables you to communicate with a Purse representative and the bitcoin buyer, keeping you updated throughout the process  Purse respond to user requests relatively quickly and resolves issues in a timely manner  Bitcoin buyers and sellers are able to review each other and award points.  Cons  It can be difficult to find a buyer for a relatively small order  As a basic level user, you are initially limited to a 8% discount, although the front page of the site strongly promotes a figure of 20%  The buying process is somewhat convoluted and can be confusing at times  Not being able to receive my full order – although this seems to be an issue with Amazon not shipping multiple orders, rather than a problem with Purse  The order arrived a full seven days after it was placed and I had to spend a considerable amount of time liaising with the buyer and Purse. I don't feel that the discount obtained justifies the time spent talking to both parties.  Competitors  Brawker is very similar to the service offered by Purse, but allows shopping at any online retailer (see the CoinDesk review).  Users are also able to spend their bitcoin by purchasing gift cards for e-commerce sites. Companies such as eGifter, Gyft and Gift Off. enable customers purchase digital gift cards with bitcoin (and sometimes other cryptocurrencies) and then spend those cards at sites like Amazon, iTunes, Spotify and many others.  However, unlike Brawker and Purse, these services do not currently offer any discounts.  Conclusion        The delivered productBeing able to spend bitcoin at Amazon is a huge step forward for general adoption, and the potential discounts offer an extra incentive to shop with the digital currency rather than credit/debit cards or PayPal.    The service is also useful for people who wish to purchase bitcoin with their credit or debit card – especially for those that do not want to register with ID and proof of address at an exchange.  While I do not plan to use the service again for smaller orders (the incentive is just not big enough), I would consider doing so for more expensive items where the discount results in a more notable saving.

Please do your own extensive research before considering committing any funds to the service.",NEGATIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | RESEARCH,Yessi Bello Perez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/03/13/review-is-purses-discount-really-worth-the-hassle,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b045fd4eb245eed986bc7e714230df2acc197045-1153x790.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42378086,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7M26b,1426241735,Is Bitcoin's Merchant Appeal Fading?,"While it's safe to say that 2014 was a banner year for bitcoin in terms of merchant adoption – with the likes of Overstock, DISH, Dell and Microsoft entering the space – 2015 hasn't quite started with the same bang.  Though rumors continue to swirl about a possible Uber or Airbnb entrance, the highest profile merchant to accept bitcoin this year has been a local subsidiary of global real estate franchise RE/MAX.  Members of the bitcoin processing ecosystem seem divided on the state of this industry sector entering March.  Those contacted by CoinDesk all agreed that, after months of grabbing the lion's share of headlines, big merchant announcements have been ""tapering off"" for bitcoin. But, while some voiced their belief that the current lapse in mainstream media attention will pass, others suggested it points to new challenges for merchant acquisition.  Akif Khan, vice president of solutions strategy at Bitnet, suggested this development says little about the underlying appeal of bitcoin as a payment tool:  ""Over the last year, there haven’t been that many large merchants announcing that they’re accepting bitcoin – Overstock, Dell, Microsoft, Expedia, Time Inc and a few others. That’s really only one every couple of months. That will ebb and flow, so I don’t think we should read too much into having a quiet patch for a month or so.""  Michael Dunworth, CEO of bitcoin processor SnapCard, echoed this optimism, indicating his belief that ""we'll see more [merchants] than ever before start accepting [bitcoin] this year"".  The statement is supported by findings in CoinDesk's most recent State of Bitcoin Report that showcase how, while slowing, the number of merchants in the ecosystem is expected to grow from 80,000 to 140,000 by the end of 2015.  Still, Steve Beauregard, CEO of cryptocurrency payments gateway GoCoin, had a different take, suggesting that many merchants haven't yet had a positive enough experience with bitcoin for a substantial uptick in adoption to take place.  ""I believe merchants have been widely disappointed by the number of transactions they see in bitcoin,"" Beauregard said.  He went on to state that ""consumer adoption is the problem"", speaking out against the 'if you build it they will come' mentality of the bitcoin ecosystem in past years.  Both BitPay and Coinbase, two of the most visible market leaders in terms of bitcoin processing, declined to comment on the state of their merchant operations.  The WordPress effect  One of the most public stories involving bitcoin merchants this year may have been the decision by web publishing giant WordPress to remove bitcoin from its checkout page.  Among the first major merchants to accept bitcoin, and an early advocate for the payment tool based on its political implications, the publishing platform has since expressed its continued desire to support the ecosystem. However, its decision was seen by many as a symbolic blow given the role it played in increasing bitcoin awareness.  Dunworth indicated that the event shows bitcoin won't always serve the needs of merchants and that the payment method might not be a one-size-fits-all solution. ""I don't think WordPress saw enough value having it on their platform,"" he said.  Khan, however, said that the experience of one merchant is not indicative of the state of the sector.  ""Citing WordPress shutting down support is also a little alarmist given the subsequent announcement from them that they still intend to support it,"" Khan explained.  Value proposition remains  Although the sector has fallen into what some might call a quiet period, most respondents indicated that the underlying value proposition for merchants – that the reduced processing fees can yield cost savings – remains intact.  Bitnet indicated that enterprise merchants remain interested in bitcoin as a means to drive revenue, while GoCoin said the potential savings and ""cool factor"" of bitcoin are still advantages that resonate with merchants.  Industry observers have a somewhat different view. Coinbase's business development manager Nick Tomaino, responding to a query on the social network ZapChain, voiced his personal belief that the slowdown is the result of merchants losing the coveted ""first-mover advantage"".  ""A year ago, it made a big splash to be the first large company to accept bitcoin in any segment – you'd be the first in your segment and gain thousands of loyal new customers,"" he said. ""I think we'll continue to see that happen in new segments, but there's simply fewer of those segments today than there was a year ago.""  Jad Mubaslat, CEO of bitcoin exchange BitQuick, put it more simply, alluding to the somewhat disappointing numbers industry merchants see after the first few months of adoption.  ""[There's] not enough added business to justify it yet,"" he said.  'Passive' approach  One commonly cited issue was that, while some merchants have enabled bitcoin, they may not be putting in the effort to help it succeed at the level needed to produce cost savings.  ""We'll see bigger names than last year, but it won't just be accepting it for some areas of their checkout, it will be unique and interesting adaptations which will help increase the awareness and accessibility worldwide,"" Dunworth said.  Beauregard, too, spoke to issues with how merchants have attempted to leverage bitcoin.  ""Most merchants have taken a passive approach to integrating bitcoin as a payment method, instead of strategically testing and optimizing checkout flows to encourage consumer adoption,"" he said.  Those who have seen success, he argued, have taken steps to invest time and resources into testing their checkout and educating customers.  ""Merchants should have a strategic plan for digital currency and actually execute on it - not simply sign-up, integrate and expect traffic.""  Dunworth expressed hope that more merchants would follow the path of early market leader Overstock, which has since continued to experiment and engage with the ecosystem, or IBM, which, while not a merchant, has expressed interest in the technology.  He concluded:  ""These big businesses are seeing advantages that extend outside of just accepting it, but really leveraging the power of the blockchain to innovate their business and make it more efficient.""

42378081,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7M25L,1426205921,IBM Rumored to Be Developing Bitcoin Alternative,"IBM may be looking to further its exploration of bitcoin and blockchain technologies in a way that goes beyond its previously revealed proof of concept ADEPT.  Reuters  reports the US-based tech giant is seeking to create a digital cash and payment system for traditional currencies that uses blockchain technologies.  Citing a person familiar with the matter, IBM said the objective is to make traditional payments instantaneous while cutting out traditional intermediaries such as banks and clearing parties.  The article explained:  ”The transactions would be in an open ledger of a specific country's currency such as the dollar or euro, said the source, who declined to be identified because of a lack of authorization to discuss the project in public.”  The source reportedly went on to call the project a “bitcoin but without the bitcoin”, adding that it is still in its early stages. Further, he spoke positively about the possibilities the project aims to achieve, suggesting the blockchain can help make payments more convenient and easier to use.  ""We are at a tipping point right now,"" the source continued. ""It's making a lot more sense for some type of digital cash in the system, that not only saves our government money, but also is a lot more convenient and secure for individuals to use.""
