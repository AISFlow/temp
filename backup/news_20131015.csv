42376626,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6bTih,1381854671,Chinese internet giant Baidu starts accepting bitcoin,"Search engine giant Baidu has announced it is now accepting payment in bitcoin for its Jiasule service, which improves websites' performance, speed and security.  Baidu, which has a market cap of $53 billion, is rated by web information company Alexa Internet as the most visited website in China and the fifth most visited website in the world.  Founded in January 2000, Baidu is similar to Google in that its offers a variety of tools and services to produce information and products in response to search terms, however, Baidu is specific to Chinese-language search terms.  Baidu Jiasule is a cloud-based anti-DDOS service and content delivery network, similar to US-based CloudFlare.  Here's a rough translation of the company's news release:    Baidu Jiasule Accepts Bitcoin Payment      How can we reflect the characteristics of a trendy IT person and a professional webmaster? The answer, of course, is to own bitcoins!!!    Bitcoin is a new kind of electronic currency, a digital transfer medium, which has already received a high degree of international recognition, and has already reached into our daily lives. It can be used to buy a cup of coffee, or exchanged for gold and silver. In China, bitcoin is considered quite ""trendy"".    Today, I have good news for everyone: from 14 October 2013 onwards, Baidu Jiasule will officially support bitcoin payments. Baidu Jiasule users can use bitcoin to pay for any Jiasule services. Baidu Jiasule, as the innovator of the Internet, has become the first cloud services vendor to support bitcoin, giving us richer payment methods and experience.    In the future, Baidu Jiasule will continue to try more new things, giving everyone more convenient payment options.    Jon Matonis, executive director of the Bitcoin Foundation, said the announcement was ""encouraging news"", especially since it is coming from China and a NASDAQ-listed company.  ""I suspect that Baidu's reasons [for making this move] are similar to the WordPress decision for opening up their services to an expanded customer base. Bitcoin reaches 60+ countries that are currently ignored by VISA, Mastercard, and PayPal,"" he added.  Matonis went on to say that many Chinese citizens live abroad, but still use Baidu, so it will be useful for these people to be able to pay in bitcoin.  When asked whether this development will encourage more companies to start accepting bitcoins, he said: ""I am confident that as more companies see the benefits of frictionless payments with low fees, immediate settlement, and zero chargebacks, they will want to accept bitcoin simply to remain competitive.""  At the time of writing, Blockchain.info showed Baidu's wallet had only received 0.1584 BTC, which equates to around $22, however, it's worth bearing in mind it is the day after the payment option's launch.  Popularity surge  Bitcoin has been gaining in popularity in China over recent months, with data on SourceForge showing downloads of the Bitcoin-QT in China reaching 250,443 so far this year, beaten only by the US with 503,819 but ahead of the UK with 106,931.  Not only this, but the volume of bitcoins traded with Chinese yuan is increasing. Bitcoincharts shows that Chinese yuan currently accounts for 12% of the total bitcoin exchange volume, while 68% is in US dollars and euro at 6%.  Last month, BTCChina CEO Bobby Lee confirmed that bitcoin was starting to boom in China.  “For the first time in human history, bitcoin has allowed people to save and defer purchasing power, in a digital form. The Chinese people love this concept! It explains bitcoin’s fast adoption in China this year – 2013 has been a breakout year for bitcoin, and even more so in China,"" he said.  CoinDesk contacted Baidu for comment, but had not received a reply at time of publication. Updates to follow.  What do you think this means for bitcoin?",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/10/15/chinese-internet-giant-baidu-starts-accepting-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4fba42e6869cebca70374c9723b3bdf098b20186-1024x768.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376624,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6bTjx,1381848031,Taxi firms seek to drive bitcoin adoption,"Ask your average London cabbie or New York cab driver whether they know what bitcoin is and they're likely to give you an ""eh?"" and a blank look.  With this in mind, the likelihood of finding a taxi that accepts payment in digital currency is extremely slim. However, slowly but surely, this is starting to change.  Lithuanian taxi firm JazzExpress started accepting bitcoin on 20th September this year. Jonas Gilys, development director at the company, said he and his colleagues first heard about bitcoin back in 2009, when they also started mining the cryptocurrency.  ""We decided to start accepting bitcoins in our taxis in order to help increase the impact of bitcoin – we love the idea of bitcoin and we want it to become more popular. Also it gives more flexibility for our customers and helps us to save money on fees,"" he said.  The company currently operates 13 vehicles in Lithuania's capital city Vilnius, but hopes to expand its fleet to 20 by the end of the year.  Gilys explained the process of paying for a taxi journey in bitcoins:  ""All JazzExpress cabs are equipped with a Samsung Tablet. We are working with BitPay, which provides us with software that generates a QR code at the end of trip, the customer then scans the QR code, pushes the send button, and the payment is made.""  The taxi firm has already received a few fares in bitcoins, but hopes it'll become a more regular method of payment in the near future.  A slow start  Cumbria Cabs in England is also now enabling customers to pay in bitcoins, but is yet to receive a fare in BTC.  ""We only started accepting bitcoins using BitPay a couple of months ago, and we are still awaiting our first BTC-paying customer,"" said Alistair Nixon, owner for Cumbria Cabs.  “I was attracted by the very low charges for sending and receiving payments when compared with credit cards, PayPal and other online payments,"" he told The Cumberland News.  Nixon went on to say he thinks paying for a taxi journey in bitcoin will appeal to the many customers from outside the UK he takes to and from airports as it means they don't have to make sure they are carrying local currency.  Another English taxi driver – Daniel Hart, who is based in Herefordshire – is not only accepting payment in bitcoin, he's actively encouraging it by offering a 10% discount to those who pay in the cryptocurrency.  Hart told Radio 4, back in April: ""When I first heard about bitcoin a few years ago, I thought [it had the] potential to solve a lot of problems. I looked into it and thought it had a future.""  The technology lover, whose taxi is equipped with free Wi-Fi for its customers, also runs a ""Bitcoin coaching service"", charging 0.25 bitcoin per hour to teach people the ins and outs of the digital currency.  Spreading adoption  Meanwhile Go-Taxi is trying to spread the adoption of bitcoin by taxi drivers across the world. The company offers a cloud-hosted booking and despatch system to taxi firms across the world. Customers can book a cab via the Go-Taxi app and then pay for their journey in bitcoin via the app, too.  Tim Tuxworth, founder of the company, which is based in Edmonton, Canada, said: ""We are looking to provide an international service, one where people can use our system to get a taxi anywhere and pay in bitcoin.""  He added:  ""The limitations and costs associated with credit cards are prohibitive. Virtual cash, on the other hand, seems to offer a simple and practical way to pay by phone, or app, for a taxi ride.""  Go-Taxi is already being used in a number of locations including Hong Kong, North Carolina, Jersey Shore, Tampa Bay, Chicago and Florida, but the company hopes to continue expanding its reach across the globe. Hopefully there'll soon be a taxi firm near you that will take you from A to B in return for BTC.  Would you pay for taxi journeys in bitcoin if you had the opportunity?",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/10/15/taxi-firms-seek-to-drive-bitcoin-adoption,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7a5e19754f080f1e73a34a884f3ec0824f83936a-1024x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376620,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6bTev,1381829458,LeetCoin enables skilled gamers to win bitcoins,"It seems as if bitcoin and gambling are inexplicably intertwined.  With that in mind, here's a look at LeetCoin. It's a platform that allows multiplayer gamers in genres such as first person shooters to really know the score. That's because the winner gets bitcoins, while the loser gives some BTC away.  The concept of LeetCoin is simple. You sign in with a Steam account – a digital gaming distribution platform – then you are routed to LeetCoin's servers, where you play Steam-based games through a wagering system. Kingsley Edwards, the developer behind LeetCoin who decided to get involved with bitcoin earlier this year, describes his service as similar to that of a poker table.  ""It's like a poker game. The servers you connect to (via Steam login) are like a table. Each server has a different wager. Right now, it is set at 0.001 bitcoin for each kill,"" says Edwards.  The company makes it money from a 4.95% fee on wager transactions. Edwards, based in Toronto but raised in Las Vegas, described this fee as ""like a rake"" in poker. LeetCoin has been in development since June, and since launching last week has signed up more than 300 beta users.  After stabilizing its Google App Engine-powered server load through this initial beta period, the company is now looking for more people to test its platform. Gamers looking for more incentives to engage in multiplayer games might see LeetCoin as a good way to make a bit of money on the side.  At the recent Bitcoin Price Index value of $133.12 per BTC, that means each kill in Counterstrike is currently worth around thirteen cents per kill, or $1.33 for ten slayings on LeetCoin's current wagering amount. Of course, it's important to keep in mind that if you die in the game, you'll pay. But it still seems like an interesting concept regardless.  In-game gambling is expected to be a big market for bitcoin as well as other decentralized virtual currencies. The reason? Unlike existing payment systems, gamers can send and receive BTC almost instantly. There's no need to wait, and as a result the user obtains instant gratification for wins (although the immediacy is the same for losses).  Artbiter  is another example of this concept, but for more casual mobile games. An in-game mobile platform for bitcoin, that company recently went through the Boost VC incubator program and has partnered with a popular as-yet-unnamed game publisher to provide in-app bitcoin gambling services to them.  These developments suggest that this is a great way to encourage bitcoin transactions for enthusiasts. Although no one knows yet how large corporations like Steam might feel about decentralized virtual currencies being gambled through their platforms, if there is a high level of adoption companies will have to acquiesce. And 300 users for a platform that has only been around for a week like LeetCoin is pretty darn good.  Expect to see more companies like LeetCoin in the future, unless rules and regulations push them out the door.  What do you think about the possibilities of in-game bitcoin gambling?
