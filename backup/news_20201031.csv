A spokesperson for HDR called the claims ""spurious.""    The suit, filed on behalf of plaintiffs BMA LLC, Yaroslav Kolchin and Vitaly Dubinin, seeks an order of attachment against HDR assets, while claims against HDR are being litigated.  ""While being keenly aware of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ('CFTC') and Department of Justice ('DOJ') investigations and imminently forthcoming civil and criminal charges, and while preparing to go on a lam [sic] from the U.S. authorities, Defendants Hayes, Delo and Reed looted about $440,308,400 of proceeds of various nefarious activities that took place on the BitMEX platform from Defendant HDR accounts,"" the suit alleges.  The suit claims the alleged looting occurred to reduce the amount of assets that could be seized by authorities when charges were brought.  An attached exhibit did not specify how the funds were seized but alleged that the executives began diverting BitMEX's profits after becoming aware of possible charges in 2019.  On Oct. 1, the U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Department of Justice both announced charges against BitMEX, one of the biggest crypto derivatives trading platforms, and its senior executives.  A spokesperson for HDR Global Trading Limited denied the claims, saying: ""Pavel Pogodin of 'Consensus Law' has filed a series of increasingly spurious claims against us, and others in the cryptocurrency sector. We will deal with this through the normal litigation process and remain entirely confident the courts will see his claims for what they are.""

42385023,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAmjcn,1604154688,Crypto Is Less Scary Than Halloween,"It’s October, and if you’re at all like me you’re listening to ghost story podcasts, watching scary movies and jumping whenever things go bump in the night. When I tell people that I work in cryptocurrency, people often ask me questions straight out of a horror movie. Isn’t bitcoin creepy?      I understand their confusion: Hollywood often acts like everything crypto-related is dark web deals and criminal conduct. In fact, it’s held and traded by millions of law-abiding people around the world and, in the United States, is recognized by the Internal Revenue Service.    Catherine Coley is CEO of Binance.US.    Even the nation’s largest bank, JPMorgan Chase, wants to create a digital currency. Electronic or digital currencies hold great potential as non-inflationary global means of trade. Whether you’re an athlete or an artist, a barber or a banker, a teenager or a retiree, cryptocurrency can work for you.      Cryptocurrency is exciting, popular and useful but its increased acceptance doesn’t mean that all its shadows have disappeared. Because it’s October, I want to talk about the scariest thing in the crypto world: being tricked by scams.    The great 2020 Twitter hack    In July, hackers made off with roughly $120,000 in cryptocurrency after hacking major verified Twitter accounts. Accounts belonging to Barack Obama, Bill Gates and others published tweets asking users to send bitcoin to particular wallet addresses. The hacked accounts promised that any shared currency would be doubled and returned. They lied.      Given the size, scale and sophistication of the June Twitter hack, it’s a relief to learn that the hackers’ payoff was relatively limited: Millions of people saw the fraudulent tweets, but only 400 deposited funds with the criminals. Any single theft is one theft too many, but the comparatively low number of victims means the crypto community has learned important lessons. And the thieves themselves were schooled in Bitcoin’s technology: The immutable blockchain ledger, which records all transactions in perpetuity, led directly to their arrest.      See also: Twitter Hack 2020 - Full Coverage      “Educate, don’t intimidate” is my motto for business and for life. As my first job was navigating Wall Street’s foreign exchange trading desks, I know how intimidating finance and its terminology can be. The same goes for crypto. From the outside, words like “staking,” “hashing” and “mining” can seem very complicated. But with a little education you, too, can understand it. The last thing I want is to intimidate you and make you believe that there’s a scammer behind every email. But I do want you to recognize the possible signs of criminal activity and protect yourself.    Everyone dealing with cryptocurrency should understand the most common grifts and schemeshttps://support.binance.us/hc/en-us/articles/360051610434-5-Common-Cryptocurrency-Scams-and-How-to-Avoid-Them. A closer look at July’s Twitter hack is useful here. The 400 victims who sent funds to hackers imitating Elon Musk or Warren Buffett didn’t know that “giveaways” promising something for nothing are a cybercriminal standby.    The July hack was more than “just” a giveaway exploit. If the criminals hadn’t compromised celebrity and politician accounts, their plan wouldn’t have worked. In July, Twitter admitted some of its employees had fallen victim to “spear phishing” attacks – they were convinced, by phone calls and seemingly official emails, to enter sensitive personal data into criminal-controlled websites.      You shouldn’t believe everything you see on social media, and you must verify before trusting every email that pops into your inbox or every caller who has your mobile phone number. Take a quick gut check, look at the sender address or Twitter handle. Does it seem too good to be true? Learn from others’ mistakes, but don’t forget that the crooks are vastly outnumbered by honest users.    Staying vigilant    The digital asset community grows savvier by the day. And much of that comes from learning from mistakes. But, I hope, by reading this you can avoid them. An educated audience makes it harder for scammers to operate, and their return on scamming is shrinking.      So, in 2020, are crypto scams on their way out? I wish they were.      Just like monsters defeated in one movie only to be revived in sequels, scammers never stay down for long. Earlier this month, I took to Twitter to warn my followers about a fraudulent newsletter making the rounds. We’re still haunted by a few bad actors. Fake cryptocurrency exchange and wallet apps occasionally still show up on mobile app stores. New members of the crypto community sometimes fail to do their own research. And a few networks with bad intentions spend all day on Telegram and Discord lurking for vulnerable targets. With more awareness around crypto and your safety, scams may grow scarcer by the day, but they’re still out there.      You may shiver to think of cybercriminals at large and in pursuit of your assets but the more you know the less worried you’re likely to be if you’ve taken the right steps to protect yourself. The perpetrators of the July 2020 Twitter hack were arrested and charged within two weeks. When investigators and law enforcement ripped their masks away, the masterminds were revealed to be teenagers from Florida and Massachusetts.      This October, as the jack-o’-lanterns are lit, you may want to indulge in a good shudder over some terrifying scam story or another. It’s true that scams are a problem, but don’t fall for panicked urban legends. You have all the knowledge you need to operate. Smart planning, critical thinking and commonsense precautions can keep you safe from the tricksters and enjoying the treats of digital assets.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MINING,Catherine Coley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/10/31/crypto-is-less-scary-than-halloween,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/83211e4e4f2eeed48d5aa0a307510f97d1b53c7d-1350x900.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405339,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeM4L3,1604138981,$14K: Bitcoin Briefly Hits Highest Level Since January 2018,"Bitcoin has soared to a 33-month high above $14,000, showing resilience amid growing instability in the traditional markets.    The top cryptocurrency by market value reached $14,047 around 10:05 UTC on Saturday – the highest level since January 2018, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.  Earlier this week, bitcoin narrowly missed breaching the June 2019 high of $13,880 and faced selling pressure as global stock markets registered sharp losses as concerns over the resurgent coronavirus spiked.  However, the downside was restricted to above $13,000 even as classic haven assets like gold fell to one-month lows near $1,860 amid the dollar strength.  Stocks have just seen both their worst week and month since March.  Bitcoin's defense of $13,000 and a quick rise to 33-month highs is perhaps not surprising.  Market sentiment has been buoyed by several public companies' recent disclosures of bitcoin treasury investments.  ""Bitcoin currently has a very strong underlying bid from institutions,"" trader and analyst Nick Cote told CoinDesk.  If the cryptocurrency manages to establish a foothold above the June 2019 high of $13,880, the focus would shift to the daily chart resistance range at $15,800–$16,000.  At press time, bitcoin had dropped back to $13,993, but is still up over 25% for October, the biggest monthly rise since April.
