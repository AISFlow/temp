42378231,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7N1QT,1435871740,How Ascribe Uses Bitcoin Tech to Help Underserved Artists,"“The creators of the Internet are getting a raw deal.”  So says Trent McConaghy, CTO for Ascribe, a startup that is using the bitcoin blockchain to timestamp intellectual property and create a sustainable ownership structure for artwork and other digital media.  In a new interview with CoinDesk, McConaghy, co-author of a recently published white paper “Towards An Ownership Layer For The Internet”, explained how his startup is aiming to provide a foundational layer for artists and other independent creators to establish ownership over their works on a decentralized database – the bitcoin blockchain – and protect those rights following publication.  The company was conceived in 2013, during which time McConaghy – alongside co-founders Masha McConaghy and Bruce Pon – explored how the ownership concepts underlying bitcoin could be applied to other types of digital assets.  He told CoinDesk:  “The question we asked then and there was, 'Why cant we own digital art the way we own bitcoin?' And that was the driving question in those early days.”  Ascribe recently announced $2m in new seed funding, backing it received from Earlybird Venture, Digital Currency Group, Freelands Ventures and a number of angel investors.  Early days  According to McConaghy, his background and those of his co-founders strongly influenced the trajectory and, ultimately, the scope of the Ascribe project.  CEO Bruce Pon spent years working in the financial services, an activity that McConaghy described as ""building banks"". Masha McConaghy, on the other hand, was a career art curator and exhibitionist, working in Paris, Berlin and Vancouver, and received a doctorate studying the relationship between commerce and art.  McConaghy himself developed and built technology companies like Solido Design Automation, which develops industrial automation software. He said he discovered bitcoin in 2010, and later became part of Berlin’s bitcoin scene after he and Masha (to whom he is married) relocated to the city in 2013.  It was in that atmosphere that work on the basic concepts of Ascribe first began, with the project growing following consultations with artists working in digital mediums.  McConaghy explained:  “We started exploring this technology and thinking about it. So we went and talked to different artist friends and they said, 'Yes, we want this yesterday.' The thing about digital artists is that they are hackers and technologists and so they think about this, living and breathing technology.”  Ownership platform  By the fall of 2013, the team was inscribing ownership claims on the bitcoin blockchain.  Over the next months, they grew the initial concept into plans for a platform that McConaghy said was aimed at providing an easy-to-use resource for creators to be able to both establish provenance as well as trace the usage of their content.  He explained:  ""What we realized is we can use copyright law as the basis of what we’re doing and have that be really easy to use, and use the blockchain as a way of recording these transactions of registering a copyright, of transferring ownerships, of licensing from person A to B, things like consignment or loaning.""  Following a private beta in the fall of 2014, Ascribe officially opened for business in February. Among the tools currently in development is an in-house search engine that allows creators to canvas the Internet for copies of their work. The search tool, currently in private beta, also grew out of discussions with artists asking for a means to trace the distribution of their work.  ""It really is about ownership and understanding what is going on with work that's attributed to you. That’s kind of where we are,"" he said, adding that the goal is ""to serve the needs of the little guy"".  McConaghy said that for him and the rest of the Ascribe team, the process ahead means further honing the platform to make usage simpler, concluding:  ""Our view is, let a thousand flowers bloom. We just want to be the plumbing, we want to make this digital ownership processing dead simple, dead easy, so people don’t have to think about it.""

42378226,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7N1KB,1435860968,Brazilian Congressman Calls for Hearing on Bitcoin Regulation,"Brazilian Congressman Manoel Junior has proposed a public hearing to discuss bitcoin and digital currency regulation.  The hearing, if held, would involve representatives from Banco Central do Brasil; the Receita Federal, the Brazilian tax enforcement agency; Conselho de Controle de Atividades Fiancerias, the country's anti-fraud agency; and representatives of the local bitcoin industry.  CoinBR  CEO Safiri Felix, the only company named in the official request, indicated that discussions about such a meeting have been ongoing since a report on the technology was released by the Brazilian Senate in December 2014. At the time, the report recommended bitcoin regulation was unnecessary.  Felix told CoinDesk:  ""The government thinks that it's time now to make this conversation deeper. We're trying to get space to educate authorities to make sure we're making a legal framework that doesn't affect the implementation of bitcoin. We're trying to learn from US and Canada and Europe to make a good legal framework for market development.""  Felix admitted to being part of early discussions on the meeting, which he suggested could be attended by experts from local universities and law firms.  The official letter from Congressman Junior elaborates further on the interests of the local government in the discussions. In particular, Junior suggested that there has been little discussion about the potential impact on financial markets.  ""There are some relevant questions which need to be asked in relation to bitcoin’s increase use,"" Junior wrote. ""Could it potentially replace fiat currency as a form of payment, unit of account and a store of value? If so, how would this impact the country authorities’ ability to define monetary and exchange policies?""  Junior also suggested his opinion that such risks should be assessed in order to maintain security as the technology becomes more widely adopted.  Community reaction  Since the announcement of the potential hearing yesterday, there has been both excitement and outrage in the local community.  For example, Brazilian entrepreneurs expressed their hope that a wider selection of the country's bitcoin companies would be able to attend the meeting, though Felix suggested that this was the ultimate intent of the hearing.  Reports indicate that there has also been widespread backlash about the news on Facebook groups specific to the Brazilian market.  Felix indicated that outcry had been particularly animated from those who had ""sympathy for libertarian views"". However, he suggested CoinBR's goal was to be an active participant in this process so that the needs of local businesses are heard as regulation is crafted.  Elsewhere, Marcelo Miranda, CEO of local bitcoin exchange FlowBTC, attested to the strong negative reaction to the hearing proposal, which he attributed to the varying ideologies of local users and questions about CoinBR's motives and involvement in the hearing.  ""The hearing could be a step in the right direction or a real turn off for a market that is still in its infancy. It is really hard to tell with the information we have now,"" Miranda said.  The full request can be found here; Updates on the status of the hearing can be followed on Camara dos Deputados, an official news forum for the Brazilian congress.

42378218,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7N1A7,1435837533,Former Silk Road DEA Agent Pleads Guilty to Bitcoin Theft,"Former Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent Carl Mark Force IV, has admitted to stealing over $700,000 worth of bitcoin while running the Baltimore Silk Road investigation.  Force, the lead undercover agent in communication with Ross Ulbricht – the mastermind behind the online drug marketplace now sentenced to life in prison – admitted using fake online personas to steal bitcoin from both the US government and investigated parties.  He pleaded guilty to charges of extortion, money laundering and obstruction of justice.  In connection to his plea, Force admitted he had offered to sell law enforcement information regarding the ongoing Silk Road investigation to Ulbricht. He also pleaded guilty to entering into a $240,000 contract with 20th Century Fox Film Studios for a film concerning the government’s investigation into the dark web marketplace, without obtaining prior approval from the DEA.  Assistant Attorney General Caldwell of the Justice Department's Criminal Division said in a statement:  ""Seduced by the perceived anonymity of virtual currency and the dark web, Force used invested online personas and encrypted messaging to fraudulently obtain bitcoin worth hundreds of thousands of dollars from the government and investigative targets alike.""  Caldwell continued: ""This guilty plea should send a strong message: neither the supposed anonymity of the dark web nor the use of virtual currency nor the misuse of a law enforcement badge will serve as a shield from the reach of the law.""  Now awaiting sentencing, Force's hearing is scheduled for 19th October.  The full accusations against him are detailed in a federal complaint submitted in the Northern District of California in late March.

42378212,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7MyEx,1435833806,Coinfloor Launches Broker-Based UK Bitcoin Marketplace,"London-based bitcoin exchange Coinfloor has launched Coinfloor Market, a broker-based peer-to-peer marketplace, which will enable consumers to buy bitcoin from professional brokers.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Coinfloor CEO Mark Lamb said the new marketplace is designed to provide a more consumer-friendly and personal bitcoin buying experience.  Bitcoin brokers, he noted, have to undergo a due diligence verification process, which will be refined over time.  Lamb added:  ""We meet all brokers in person, we get to know them and understand their business and make sure that they are operating to the same standards that Coinfloor has been operating to since launch.""  ""The important thing is that they are vetted professionals, they are not amateurs,"" he said, adding that some of the brokers have been trading with Coinfloor for a long time.  How it works  New users register with an email address and password, then are given the option to choose their preferred bitcoin broker.  Once the email address provided has been confirmed, consumers are asked to set up two-factor authentication. Following this, Coinfloor requests users to upload valid photo ID and proof of residence.  To buy bitcoin, registered users must transfer the desired amount in GBP to their chosen broker's bank account, with a minimum deposit of £20.  Once the money has been transferred, bitcoins are sourced directly from Coinfloor's exchange and held in escrow until the broker confirms the receipt of funds.  Bitcoin broker Peter Wood, known as y3peto in Coinfloor Market, said in a statement: ""My customers want a fair price, a secure transaction and a safe place to store their bitcoins. Coinfloor Market provides that ... It gives me the well deserved recognition for my work as a bitcoin broker in the UK.""  The launch follows Coinfloor's partnership with Estonian Bank LHV in March, which enabled the bitcoin exchange to handle user deposits.
