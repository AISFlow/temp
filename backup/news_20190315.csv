""I do think if we hope to smell the crypto spring in the air, it will take people walking with the regulators,"" Szczepanik, the SEC’s senior advisor for digital assets, told a crowd Friday at SXSW in Austin, Texas. ""But I do think the spring is going to come.""  In a Q&A session with attorney Daniel Kahan of Morrison & Foerster LLP, Szczepanik emphasized how the regulatory approach at the SEC is designed to let innovation flourish, though it comes at the cost of not providing completely clear guidelines for new kinds of businesses.  ""The lack of bright-line rules allows regulators to be more flexible,"" she said.  While respecting the desire from entrepreneurs to know whether they can or can't run a business in full compliance with current securities laws, she said the principles-based approach allows more opportunities to arise from new technology.  She told attendees:  ""I think if you were to propose a new regime of regulations in a precipitous way without really studying it, you might end up steering the technology one way or another.""  When asked for her thoughts on the rise of stablecoins, Szczepanik noted that there as several arrangements that allow these tokens to maintain a relatively stable price relative to other assets.  She singled out stablecoins that create two assets – one that maintains a fixed price and the other whose value fluctuates in order to help the first token’s price stay fixed (often referred to as algorithmic stablecoins).  With regard to that particular category of project, she said, ""You might be getting into the land of security.""  “Folks like to put labels on things,"" Szczepanik said of stablecoins, ""but we'll always look behind the label to see exactly what's happening. We'll give it the label it deserves under the law.""  Appropriate penalties  A topic that she returned to multiple times during the 90-minute talk was the SEC's FinHub, where companies can come in and talk with staff about approaches they are taking. Kahan offered a rule of thumb: ""It's always better to find your regulators than to let your regulators find you.  Szczepanik emphasized that dialogue with the SEC yields better outcomes for companies. In particular, she highlighted recent regulatory action against Gladius, a cybersecurity company defending against distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. Its settlement was announced in February.  As the agency acknowledged in that settlement, it did not impose a penalty on Gladius because the firm self-reported and communicated with regulators throughout the investigation.  That said, rather than focus entirely on regulatory action against companies, Szczepanik also argued that businesses can do better by working with regulators from the start.  She acknowledged that some companies will go offshore in search of more lenient regulatory regimes, but she said the real opportunity is with companies that abide by the stronger U.S. rules. ""There are benefits to doing it the right way. And when they do that they will be the gold standard,"" she contended.  Beyond the U.S., Szczepanik said regulators around the world are in regular contact about distributed ledger technology. ""I think there's a lot of excitement around the globe about how DLT can be deployed to increase efficiency,"" she said.  No-action letters  One form of relief that entrepreneurs have been seeking since the earliest days of the initial coin offering boom have been no-action letters. That is, letters from the SEC that acknowledge a review of a companies business process and affirm that the SEC will not take regulatory action against it.  Szczepanik has emphasized these before. However, attorneys in the space have noted that thus far no no-action letters have been issued.  Regardless, Sczczepanik's fundamental message was that companies will have better outcomes if they interact with securities regulators. To that end, she is going on the road now to give more entrepreneurs the opportunity to reach her.  She concluded:  ""We'd much rather have people come and ask us before they do something rather than coming and asking for forgiveness.""

Announcing the news on Thursday, Tendermint said that other participants in the round included Bain Capital and 1confirmation, among others. The investment will go toward supporting the firm’s continued development of the Cosmos Network, expanding its team and making its business model “sustainable.”  Just a day before the funding was announced, Tendermint launched Cosmos Hub, a blockchain designed to improve interoperability between any number of other blockchains, after nearly three years of planning and development. Cosmos Hub is the firm's first in a series of proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains.  “Blockchain technology is an incredible innovation that has unfortunately been hamstrung by a series of limitations, including scalability problems, a lack of usability and myriad governance and environmental issues,” Jae Kwon, CEO of Tendermint and contributor of Cosmos, said in Thursday's announcement.  He added:  “The vision of Cosmos is to overcome these limitations and break down barriers to innovation, ultimately creating an Internet of Blockchains: a decentralized network of independent, scalable, and interoperable blockchains.”  Tendermint first revealed its plans to launch a public blockchain platform as far back as 2014 through its white paper.  The project has recently released a couple of other developer-focused products, such as software development kit, or SDK, (being used by cryptocurrency exchange Binance) and Tendermint Core, which is the blockchain networking and consensus mechanism underlying the Cosmos Hub.  “We envision a future where multiple blockchains serve specific use-cases – store of value, privacy, general purpose smart contract platforms, and many others,"" said Salil Deshpande, partner at Bain Capital, in yesterday's announcement.  He added:  ""In this future, interoperability solutions provide a crucial alchemy that could lead to an explosion of blockchain applications, as well as boosting usage on existing chains.""

42402684,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdcDgJ,1552679951,"'No Change' to Bitcoin Futures Plans, CME Says, as Cboe Pulls Back","It's business as usual for CME Group's bitcoin futures market, despite a retrenchment by rival derivatives exchange operator Cboe Global Markets.  Contacted by CoinDesk Friday, a spokesperson for CME said the exchange has ""no changes to announce re our bitcoin futures contract"" and declined to comment on Cboe's pullback.  The affirmation is notable in light of the news Thursday that Cboe will not add a bitcoin futures contract for trading in March.  This means that after the last currently traded futures expire in June, this market will essentially come to a halt at Cboe Futures Exchange (CFE), at least until new futures get listed.  ""CFE is assessing its approach with respect to how it plans to continue to offer digital asset derivatives for trading. While it considers its next steps, CFE does not currently intend to list additional XBT futures contracts for trading,"" the company said in its notice to investors.  A spokesperson for Cboe declined to comment beyond Thursday's product update.  The difference in outcomes isn't all that surprising since CME's volumes have been approximately more than double Cboe's.  As of March 14, for example, the daily trading volume of CME's bitcoin futures was reported at 4,666 contracts, compared to 2,089 contracts at Cboe.  Product-market fit  Market participants offered several explanations for CME's outperformance of Cboe in bitcoin futures.  One reason could be the difference in how the two exchanges approached the product and marketed it, Lanre Sarumi, CEO of a crypto asset derivative exchange Level Trading Field, told CoinDesk.  First of all, CME made its product available to a larger group of traders from the very beginning, Sarumi explained, saying:  ""Connecting to both CME and Cboe is expensive. If you are already trading other products on an exchange, then there is no new cost. If not, you must pay for connectivity, software license, market data, cross connects etc. — all that just to trade one new product?""  Cboe put the bitcoin futures on its Cboe Futures Exchange (CFE), Sarumi goes on, where people mostly trade Cboe Volatility Index (VX) Futures: ""If you don’t trade VX then do you want to pay hundreds of dollars extra per account just to dabble in bitcoin?""  CME group, on the other hand, put bitcoin in the equities group on the CME exchange, which offers a lot of products and asset classes enjoying large daily volumes, Sarumi said. So a lot of traders already trading various assets at CME had no additional steps to take to get into bitcoin.  Other intangibles  In addition, CME invested more effort in promoting its futures than Cboe did, Sarumi believes. ""Cboe was more like 'build it and they will come.'""  The price discovery method could also contribute to CME's advantage: while Cboe's relies on an auction at the Gemini exchange, CME settles to an aggregate price of several spot markets, which might look more reliable to traders.  John Todaro, director of research at TradeBlock, says CME's strategy might have had more success due to greater flexibility.  ""CME had greater position limits, allowing single accounts to hold a larger number of contracts,"" he told CoinDesk. ""Over time, the CME gained greater market share. The Cboe raised contract limits in order to remain competitive late in the summer of 2018, but by this time the CME was trading in significantly higher volume.""

42402686,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdcDhI,1552677004,"Ethereum's ProgPow Mining Change Approved Again, But Timeline Unclear","“We’re going back to stuff we were tired of talking about months ago. We decided the only issue is whether there are errors in the algorithm [or] back doors in the algorithm.”  So said Greg Colvin during a heated debate during an ethereum developer call Friday over a proposed change to the network's mining algorithm known as Programmatic Proof-of-Work or “ProgPoW.”  A change that would impact the estimated $655 million annual market for ethereum's mining rewards, ProgPow is aimed at reducing the efficiencies of specialized mining devices called ASICs and maximizing the performance of general purpose hardware called GPUs. Both types of machines can be deployed on the network as of 2018, a development that has set off a contentious debate.  Some believe optimizing the network for GPUs will enable more ethereum users to compete for new cryptocurrency awarded by the protocol, while others believe large mining firms are likely to push out such individuals regardless of what types of chips are capable of conducting the computing requirements needed.  Still, developers reached a tentative agreement about the code in early January, prompting Colvin today to question why the agenda item discussing the proposal persisted.  “Nobody objected. Many agreed. Nobody blocked it. We had a consensus that we’re moving forward unless there were technical issues,” said Colvin.  But investigating these potential ""technical issues"" is proving to be harder task than expected.  Having initiated third-party security audits of the ProgPoW code, core developers agreed that a working group of project managers would be in charge of executing and reporting the findings of these audits. But disagreement over the deliverables of the audits has been delaying this process.  Highlighting that the audits have not yet begun for ProgPoW, Hudson Jameson, Ethereum Foundation community relations manager, noted during the call that the original plan to conduct two separate audits over the proposal may not go entirely as planned.  “We may not do the benchmarking [audit] at all, because that is the less important part of the two pieces of the audit,” explained Jameson.  This second audit, Jameson added, would serve to do a “constraint analysis on ProgPoW to look over claims in how efficient a ProgPoW ASIC would be compared to a [GPU],” among other analysis on “proposed ASIC architecture” and “economic analysis on the impact ProgPoW would have on the economics of ethereum protocol.”  The path ahead  Explaining that he had tried to pin down the deliverables to these audits before, core developer Alexey Akhunov admitted the process “was very difficult.”  “What is the goal [of ProgPoW]? What is the criteria of success? So far, I’ve not been able to extract this from people who are suggesting ProgPoW,"" Akhunov emphasized.  While debate over how to best conduct ProgPow audits is likely to continue outside of today’s call, core developers did reaffirm ProgPoW remained an approved proposal for inclusion in either ethereum’s next upcoming system-wide upgrade, Istanbul, or a separate hard fork that would give ethereum's users the option to upgrade to a software that included it.  Either way, those in charge of assessing the risk of new ethereum software versions, believe the implications are the same.  “Any [Ethereum Improvement Proposal] that we accept for hard fork if it later turns out there’s something horrible wrong with it, yes, we’re going to pull it.

42402699,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdcDr8,1552670120,I Got the Mark of the Beast – And It Will Hold My Bitcoin,"""What happens when you need an MRI?""  Someone answers for me: ""You die an excruciating death… Actually, they remove them painfully quickly or the machine does.""  I'm sure these paranoid, exaggerated remarks didn't help as I sat down at the folding table in front of a large man with a 14-gauge needle. I was sweating through my shirt.  ""Are you gonna pass out?"" he asks.  ""I don't think so.""  It's literally right on my face – in the form of a septum piercing – that I'm pretty familiar with needles.  ""Three, two and one,"" the man with the needle said as he pushed it into the squishy part of my left hand, between my thumb and index finger.  It was all of one second of pain, and then it was over. I hardly even bled.  And just like that, I was now officially a cyborg.  So, what the hell am I doing here? Well several years ago, in 2014, I stumbled on this guy, Martijn Wismeijer, aka Mr. Bitcoin, who had gotten a microchip implant that he then programmed to hold his cryptocurrency.  I doubt I really knew much about the transhumanism movement back then, but I have always been fascinated with robots and the idea of melding robots into humans or vice versa. This seemed right up my alley, as even back then, I was basically covering crypto full-time, so I started reaching out but communication eventually dropped off and it was all but forgotten.  Until this January, when Bryan Bishop, the Bitcoin Core developer that's known for his tremendously fast typing and in turn his transcriptions of conferences, mentioned BDYHAX to me. ""There's a lot of transhumanists in the bitcoin community,"" he said.  But the conference's agenda had already piqued my interest – ""Implantable Tech Area.""  I'm there.  Freedom of...  Bishop's right – at least anecdotally, that there's an overlap between the body hackers and the bitcoiners. Transhumanism does, in fact, link them. Bitcoin pioneer Hal Finney seems to have been one, since he cryogenically froze his body, hoping that sometime in the future he might be able to be resuscitated.  It probably doesn't come as much of a surprise that folks that believe technology can create a better future as it relates to money, payments, shit just about everything, would think that technology can also make humans themselves better.  Take Bishop's recently revealed designer baby venture.  Funded with his bitcoin savings, Bishop's project, recently written about in MIT Technology Review, looks to allow parents to genetically engineer their babies to have features like muscles without ever picking up a dumbbell or enhanced memory.  If that sentence sounds weird – almost like adding apps to your smartphone – it's because it kinda is. There's mounting criticism and concern over the practice, especially after a Chinese biophysicist named He Jiankui claimed he'd made the first genetically edited babies.  If you give your imagination even a tiny bit of wiggle room, you can see why.  Do parents have the right to choose how their children look and act? This can't be a cheap procedure; will everyone be able to edit their children to be smarter or will it only be the rich that benefit? Will we lose some humanity if everyone edit's themselves for the flavor of the week?  Yet for all those dystopian futures (that I very much see and worry about), ultimately some of this could no doubt be beneficial and save hundreds of thousands, maybe even millions of lives.  For instance, one of Bishop's first examples – something we talked about in the Fall last year – was making humans resistant to HIV.  Future humans will think we're barbaric if we resist this kind of medical achievement.  While I'm not so interested, and even slightly disturbed, by genetic beauty enhancements such as muscles or blue eyes, I worry these concerns could push this type of biohacking into the shadows.  And that's a shame.  Bodies and money  We've seen a similar thing happen in the cryptocurrency space.  There are hacks, scams, fucking idiots and all sorts of bad things lurking in the blockchain scene, and typically that's made many turn up their noses to the whole industry. They lump it all together and mark it ""useless,"" ""nefarious,"" ""shit.""  And I get it. I look around the crypto industry, after being here for six years, and see rot. I see individuals who only want to make quick money at the expense of others; I see companies touting their disrupting finance but actually enstating the same, arbitrary, discriminatory rules as legacy banks.  Where the fuck did the ethos go?  I'll tell you. It might be hard to see through all the ""sky is falling"" – or during a hype cycle all the glitz of free money – but it's in Venezuela, helping people literally starving because of their corrupt government, hold onto some value. It's in the lightning torch, hopping all around the world, showing people the power of a stateless digital currency.  And because those instances exist, I'll take some of the bullshit.  Because that's what I'm here for – an alternative to the systems that were created without my input and sometimes do not work for – to be more clear, work against – me and other individuals.  ""We're all already attuned to this, we want freedom, we don't want to be told what we can and can't do with our bodies, what we can or can't put into our bodies, and people don't want to be told what they can and can't do with their money,"" Chad Creighton, a vice president at blockchain development consultancy BlockSaw, who was at BDYHAX, said.  While our bodies and our money could seem like apples and oranges, they're really not. Because what we can do with our bodies is directly determined by what we can do with our money.  Case in point, for some in the biohacking space, healthcare is too costly and big pharma, insurance providers, even doctors are working against the people, the individuals who need care. For cryptocurrency aficionados, the great monolithic entity to disrupt is the Federal Reserve, state monetary policy, the banks.  There's an overlapping ""distrust of formal institutions,"" Bishop told me. ""They have gotten so large and bureaucratic, it's sometimes more practical to go your own way and see what you can get done. Even more specifically, some people see certain regulations directly interfering with people's right to live.""  He gives the example of a DIY biohacker figuring out a way to make insulin cheaper and then offering that to diabetics, which would be technically illegal.  As with all these anarchist attempts, Don Andres Ochoa, a biotechnologist and data scientist speaking at the event, gave the best rallying cry:  ""Fuck it, let's fix the problem ourselves.""  Scared of needles?  These two fields of research ""are not directly useful to each other, but there's a common source of inspiration,"" Bishop said.  And they do mix together at a certain point. For instance, because of the controversy surrounding designer babies today, Bishop is cognizant that cryptography-backed privacy tech will likely play some role – if nothing else, at least as it relates to anonymous payments for the service.  Still, all this stuff seems outrageous to the majority of people.  ""Right now, the idea or concept of body hacking is literally bleeding edge (ha),"" said Amal Graafstra, the founder and CEO of VivoKey, the maker of the implant I got.  With implants, as with cryptocurrency, ""the overlap is directly related to people's sense of adventure,"" he continued.  Case in point, Jerrah Cameron, a Denver-based programmer, who stumbled upon the body hacking scene only about a month ago and already has three implants – two small chips and this larger NFC chip, for which he had a gnarly one-inch slice on the side of his right hand.  For the novelty these devices provide so far – I currently have my chip programmed to take an NFC-enabled phone to my ""receive bitcoin"" QR code, making it fast and easy for someone to send me a tip – most people won't want to get poked, he said.  That's why he's working on an application that would allow the chips to be used as payment mechanisms, housing first the tokens needed for apps like Apple Pay, Google Pay or Venmo, and then in the future even cryptocurrencies.  And VivoKey is also working on something similar.  In a week or so, Graafstra and his team plan on releasing an API that can allow developers to program one of their chips (yes, the one I have! squee) to act as an authenticator key. With this, users should be able to request that their chip be tapped to verify any send or transfer of crypto within a wallet.  ""The idea was to develop a completely autonomous secure element under the skin,"" Graafstra told CoinDesk.  And the company also offers a chip (not the one I have) that can actually complete key generation and the signing of a transaction all within the chip. That's currently in private beta and requires quite a lot of programming to make it all work, so it's not ready for mainstream use yet.  So for now, my hand isn't worth any more than it was when I was just a boring old human (although it has facilitated $2 worth of bitcoin).

The RAID Project had planned to raise $6 million through the sale of a token called XRD to the exchange's customers. But Bittrex said it called off the sale after learning that the issuer's strategic partnership with an e-gaming data analytics company OP.GG had been abruptly terminated.  That alliance ""was a vital part of the RAID project,"" Bittrex said in a statementhttps://bittrex.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025035532. ""When Bittrex International became aware of this significant event, we did not feel that it was in the best interest of our customers to move forward with the IEO.""  For its part RAID claimed that it, and not Bittrex, pulled the offering, saying:  “RAID Project Team decided that it would not be right to proceed as scheduled on March 15 with Bittrex IEO due to the current changes. Therefore, after a discussion with Bittrex, RAID Team came to a final decision to not proceed with IEO.""  RAID also said it would issue refunds ""as soon as possible"" to to investors who participated in a previous token sale, conducted through a platform called Cobak.  Conflicting statements  In a statement on its website, OP.GG suggested the partnership with RAID was never even a done deal, saying:  ""OP.GG has stopped all potential business discussions related to RAID project and there will be no economic and technical cooperation with RAID coin. In addition, OP.GG has no intention of developing any blockchain related business utilizing RIOT GAMES data. OP.GG will take all possible legal measures against individuals or organizations disseminating false facts related to this. [Emphasis added.]""  However, according to CCN and Coinspeaker, the founders of RAID, Cheonwoo Park and Taesung Kim, were also the CEO and CSO of OP.GG.  The token was originally pitched as a measure to “give data ownership back to users using blockchain technology” using a game data ecosystem. The project was also going to use the token to develop new gaming-related businesses such as game marketing, game data analysis and game distribution platform.  While much remains unclear about the relationship between OP.GG and RAID and why it unraveled, Bittrex said the cancelation was the prudent move, concluding:  ""Bittrex remains vigilant to ensure the integrity of our markets. ...

42402692,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdcDoB,1552661121,Bitcoin Trading Volume Tops $11 Billion For First Time In Nearly a Year,"Daily trading volume for the world's largest cryptocurrency bitcoin exceeded $11 billion Friday, the most observed in a 24-hour period since April 25 of last year.  At that time, the average price of bitcoin was $8,845, while today the crypto asset is listed for less than half the price, currently trading at $3,951 as per CoinMarketCap. However, the return in volume is potentially a sign investors aren't losing interest in bitcoin despite the less than favorable market conditions.  Interestingly, the amount of bitcoin trade volume had closely aligned with it’s price trend for years, but upon closer examination, the close connection ended during the latest market rout in November when trade volumes failed to sink along with the quickly depreciating broader cryptocurrency market.  As can be seen below, the divergence between trading volume is evident for not only bitcoin, but other top-ranked cryptocurrencies like the fourth-largest in the world by market cap, litecoin (LTC).  Bitcoin Trading Volume  Just before the plunge to $3,000, bitcoin was priced at $6,385 on Nov. 10 when it accumulated $3.70 billion in 24-hour exchange volume, according to data from Coinmarketcap.  Today, however, bitcoin’s price is nearly half of what it was in November, yet its trading volume is just above $11 billion, which is 200 percent more than the trading volume seen on Nov. 10 and a value last commonly observed in April 2018.  Coinmarketcap data further reveals the most exchange volume the world's largest cryptocurrency ever saw in a single day was $23.84 billion when bitcoin's price was $17,429.50 on Jan. 05, 2018.  Litecoin Exchange Volume  Litecoin’s exchange volume is following a similar trajectory as bitcoin's exchange volume.  As can be seen above, exchange volume began to deviate from litecoin’s price trend around November once again, when the cryptocurrency was trading in the $50 dollar range and exchange volume figures spanned from roughly $300 million to just over $600 million, according to data from Coinmetrics.  Litecoin's is now trading at $58 and its 24-hour exchange volume registers $1.79 billion - again, more than double the values frequently observed before the cryptocurrency plunged below $30 in November.  The slight difference between litecoin and bitcoin's trading volume and price relationship is that litecoin's price has increased over 100 percent since its December low along with the rise in exchange volume, while bitcoin has seen a more seldom 20 percent increase from its low.

In Japan, you are legally considered a minor until the age of 20.  From Aug. 14 to Sept. 1, 2018, the youth is said to have repeatedly hacked cryptocurrency wallet Monappy by leveraging a glitch on its website, sending multiple transfer requests to himself and causing losses to about 7,700 users of the service.  He later transferred the stolen tokens to an account with a different cryptocurrency platform where he exchanged the monacoin for another cryptocurrency. The stolen funds were spent it on items such as a smartphone, according to the report.  Japanese police said the youth has confessed to the crimes, the Times writes, quoting him as saying:  “I felt like I’d found a trick no one knows and did it as if I were playing a video game.”  Monappy’s website has been offline since the hacks, and currently reads that the “service has been suspended due to external attacks.”  In November, Monappy posted an updated on its Medium blog, saying that it had “completed the direct repair of defects” and was conducting a “final security check” before resuming its operations.

42381705,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9oJQv,1552647621,Strong Bitcoin Volumes Bode Well for Price Breakout,"View  Bitcoin’s daily trading volume remains elevated at highs above $10 billion, going against the technical theory that investor interest tends to drop during periods of consolidation. Therefore, the ongoing sideways trading near $3,900 may end with a bull breakout toward the recent high of $4,207.  Trading volumes have been strong since the corrective rally kicked off in early February, so a range breakdown looks unlikely.  Prices could first see a drop below $3,865 (March 12 low) due to the extended consolidation. That said, the short-term outlook would turn bearish only if the higher low of $3,743 created on March 3 is breached  Bitcoin's current period of price consolidation may end with a bull breakout, price-volume analysis indicates.  While the cryptomarket leader is lacking a clear directional bias for the tenth straight day, 24-hour trading volume remains elevated near the 10-month high of $10.75 billion seen on Feb. 24, contradicting the popular theory that investor interest drops in a rangebound market.  As a result, the pullback from recent highs near $4,200 appears likely to be nothing more than a bull breather and BTC could soon draw bids.  Validating that argument is the fact that the recovery rally from the lows near $3,400 seen on Feb. 8 was backed by high volumes. Daily trading levels jumped above their 50-day moving average 35 days ago and have remained above the key metric ever since – a feat last observed during the height of the bull market in the third quarter of 2017, according to CoinMarketCap data.  Hence, the probability of BTC ending the ongoing consolidation with a strong move to the downside is quite low.  As of writing, BTC is trading at $3,930, representing a 0.5 percent gain on a 24-hour basis, according to CoinMarketCap. Twenty-four-hour trading volume is seen at $10.62 billion, while the 50-day moving average of daily trading volume is seen at $7.615 billion.  Daily chart  As seen above, BTC jumped 7.5 percent on Feb. 8 (arrow), invalidating the immediate bearish setup. The strong move was backed by a hike in trading volumes above their 50-day MA. Since then, volume bars have consistently printed above the key average, validating the corrective rally from $3,400.  The setup looks even more bullish if we take into account the higher lows and higher highs on volume chart. Recent price pullbacks were accompanied by a drop in volumes (lack of bear support), explaining the weak follow-through to the rising channel breakdown witnessed on Feb. 24.  The failed breakdown coupled with elevated volumes amid price consolidation indicates scope for a re-test of $4,208 (Feb. 24 high).  That said, the long period of consolidation could test the bulls’ resolve, and a brief drop below the immediate support of $3,865 (March 12 low) could be seen before a continuation of the rally.

The agencies are of the view that cryptocurrency platforms are hybrid in nature, meaning they can perform functions of one or more market participants, including alternative trading systems, exchanges, dealers, custodians and clearing agencies.  Therefore, they are considering the preparation of a set of “tailored” regulatory requirements to address the risks and features of cryptocurrency platforms.  Currently, none of the cryptocurrency exchanges in Canada is recognized as an exchange nor is authorized to operate as a marketplace or dealer, according to the paper.  The recent QuadrigaCX saga highlighted the lack of regulations covering the cryptocurrency industry in Canada.  The Canadian cryptocurrency exchange’s CEO, Gerald Cotten, died last December, apparently without leaving a way for staff to access the computer storing the failing exchange’s funds. QuadrigaCX still owes its customers roughly $190 million in both cryptocurrency and fiat.  Last month, the securities watchdog in the Canadian province of British Columbia, the British Columbia Securities Commission (BCSC), said that it has no remit to regulate the troubled exchange.

42381706,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9oJN9,1552640402,Decentralized or Nothing: Song Duels IBM Over Blockchain Hype at SXSW,"More or less decentralized? For Jimmy Song, there's no in between.  An author and Bitcoin Fellow at venture firm Blockchain Capital, Song made that point repeatedly in a debate with IBM engineer and Hyperledger Fabric co-lead Chris Ferris at SXSW Thursday, where he told the crowd at the Hilton Austin in no uncertain terms: ""You either have control over your stuff or you don't. It's a zero or a one.""  The debate pitted permissioned blockchains – the private networks being pitched to big business – against permissionless blockchains – the technology undergirding bitcoin and other open-source networks. Billed as a ""deathmatch"" on the festival agenda, Song was determined to give the audience what they came for.  ""Why do you need permission if it's supposed to be decentralized?"" he asked. ""There has to be an entity that's giving you permission, and that's by definition centralized.""  While Song took the binary view of decentralization, Ferris argued that blockchains can exist on a spectrum. Sure, permissioned blockchains are less decentralized, Ferris said, but their added trust mechanisms mitigate perceived risk.  “Permissionless blockchains do not necessarily solve the problem of trust,"" he added.  Song wasn't having it. To illustrate the degree to which he was willing to extend his point, Song used the example of the ethereum fork following the infamous hack of The DAO, when the project's developers and users agreed to introduce a code update aimed at rolling back the stolen funds.  ""I think Ethereum is a permissioned blockchain,"" Song said, adding:  ""When Vitalik says, 'These particular transactions aren't particularly good for the ecosystem so we're going to roll them back,' that, to me, is a permissioned blockchain.""  On stage and in conversation with CoinDesk beforehand, Song argued that every application of blockchain to anything but bitcoin is a waste. ""Blockchain is really useful for bitcoin,"" he said during the debate. ""Everything else has a central point of failure.”  Prior to the debate, Ferris told CoinDesk that he hoped he could make the point that there's just different use cases for different kinds of blockchains, and those use cases should determine what level of decentralization should be called for.  ""Certainly part of the conversation will be that bitcoin doesn't solve the same problems we are trying to solve in an enterprise context,"" Ferris told CoinDesk.  IBM, he explained, is primarily building products that allow large enterprise partners to share information rather than exchange money. For example, today Big Blue announced a deal to record information about businesses' legal status across France. Trying to find some common ground, Ferris argued there's space for the approaches of both sides.  ""I think there are a ton of use cases where permissioned blockchains make a ton of sense,"" Ferris said. ""I also think there's a ton of use cases where a permissioned blockchain doesn't make any sense.""  But Song didn't come to accept concessions. He said all the blockchains besides bitcoin's might as well just run on a faster, cheaper centralized database.  ""A permissioned blockchain is an oxymoron because it's a centralized database that's masquerading as something decentralized,"" Song said.  The exchange case  The QuadrigaCX exchange debacle captured the difference between the two positions better than any other part of the debate.  The Canadian exchange's owner died and lost $190 million worth of cryptocurrency when it turned out he was the only person with access to the system's private keys. Both Song and Ferris saw a disaster and yet came to very different conclusions about it.  Ferris brought up Quadriga late in the debate by first saying, ""The whole point of permissioned blockchain, enterprise blockchain, is reducing risk,"" he said.  It's a system where every major user of the protocol knows everyone else. ""We can put a governance model over that and legal framework around that says: 'If you do something to disrupt the system, we'll sue the pants off you and you'll regret that,'"" Ferris said.  Song saw that as precisely the problem. If it's possible for a governing body to step in and punish the operators of a platform, then to Song that defeats the fundamental point of decentralization.  Ferris saw Quadriga as an illustration of the fundamental user experience problem of permissionless systems because it illuminates dramatically how bitcoin doesn't have a fallback if private keys are lost.  But Song saw that as its virtue:  ""You are either self-sovereign or you are not.""  Bitcoin Core  Bitcoin does have its powerful authorities, though, a point that was argued by the debate's mediating presence, Angela Walch, a professor at St. Mary's University School of Law.  ""I am struggling with how bitcoin doesn't have similar centralization of power with the core developers,"" she said.  Walch used the example of the inflation bug disclosed in September 2018, in which developers originally minimized its true implications prior to pushing the fix.  ""They list a total of 11 people who knew about this. Those people made a decision about how they were going to fix this,"" Walch said. ""They told a few select miners at the beginning. That miner was given privileged knowledge.""  She used the point to argue that bitcoin's core developers have outsize power in the network. Users had to trust, for example, that none of those leaders who knew wouldn't short bitcoin in advance of the ultimate disclosure. ""I'm arguing those people were exercising centralized power,"" she said.  Song countered by saying that Bitcoin Core is not the only bitcoin software and it's open source, run under an MIT license that warns everyone to use it at their own risk. If something is wrong with the bitcoin software, users should be able to find that and report it.  ""If the goal is to get mass adoption, for hyper-bitcoinization,"" Walch said, ""Ninety percent of the people are not going to understand how the code works, so just saying it's open source is not an out.""  Ferris took this point further and pointed out that there is a very small number of people who are maintainers of bitcoin code, alleging that if something happened to all of them it would yield chaos.  Ultimately, the debate circled back at that point to another round on sovereignty. Should users be made collectively responsible for making sure core maintainers aren't malicious or should they use the state as a fallback?  ""You are speaking about regulation and governance frameworks as if it's a bad thing,"" Ferris began.  Song cut him off, saying, ""A lot of the time it is.""

Gox, has escaped some charges, but been found guilty of manipulating exchange data in a Japanese court.  According to a report from The Wall Street Journal on Friday, the Tokyo District Court found Karpeles guilty of wrongfully making electronic records connected to Mt. Gox’s books, but innocent on charges of embezzlement and breach of trust.  Karpeles was handed a suspended sentence of two years and six months. He must maintain a good record over the next four years to avoid jail time.  The court's verdict comes almost five years after Mt. Gox filed for liquidation in April 2014 after claiming it was hacked for 850,000 bitcoin, some of which was later found.  According to the WSJ report, Karpeles' lawyers wrote in their final argument to the court:  ""Mt. Gox did not collapse because of the defendant’s [Karpeles'] wrongdoing. On the contrary, the defendant was trying his hardest every day to prevent its collapse.""  In December, Japanese prosecutors were seeking a 10-year sentence for Karpeles for embezzlement, alleging he used about $3 million of customers’ funds for his own personal use.  Karpeles, on the other hand, reiterated his innocence and apologized several times over the years. He once said, “I never imagined things would end this way and I am forever sorry for everything that’s taken place and all the effect it had on everyone involved.”  In August last year, the Japanese bankruptcy court that initially oversaw the case sided with creditors who made a petition to move the case to civic rehabilitation. As such, creditors could file for receiving their bitcoin locked up at Mt.Gox in their original form rather than having them converted to fiat currencies.  In January, Mt.Gox' trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi announced the deadline for creditors to file proof of their claims was extended to March 15, after which the trustee will submit the rehabilitation plan to the court.

42381729,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9oJUh,1552611617,Gatecoin Crypto Exchange to Shut Down on Court’s Orders,"Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency exchange Gatecoin will shut down and enter liquidation after an unsuccessful attempt to recover funds lost in a dispute with a former payment services provider.  Announced yesterday, the company distributed the message to customers via their corporate website. There, the team behind the project explained the suspension of the service occurred after months of battling to stay afloat, and ultimately, a court order to wind-up and cease operations immediately.  In its public statement, the company blamed its prior payment service provider (PSP) for this situation. The exchange said it began having issues with banking services in September 2018, after the sudden freeze of its bank accounts in Hong Kong.  In November last year, Gatecoin announced that it would resume operations after resorting to an unnamed European payments processor – ”a fully regulated payment institution by the French regulator” they stated – and a bank in Switzerland.  The team stated:  “Even after we managed to mitigate our loss by replacing that PSP with more reliable alternatives to process our clients’ transfers in September 2018, the situation did not improve because that PSP retained a large part of our funds.”  The exchange finished it’s message assuring customers that it expects to redistribute its remaining assets to the creditors.  Since 2016, the exchange has had a series of troubles unrelated to its banking services, as it lost 185,000 ETH and 250 BTC in a cyber attack. Still, it appears the exchange will become the latest casualty of struggles to obtain adequate financial services.  In March, Bloomberg reported on how industry startups remain unable to even open up standard checking accounts. The article profiled stories from even established cryptocurrency businesses and raised the profile of what appears to be an ongoing issue.  At press time, CoinDesk was unable to obtain the full court order detailing the liquidation process. According to a discussion on a Reddit dedicated to the exchange platform, customers, including those who say they lost funds in the 2016 hack, also appear in the dark on whether they will be reimbursed.
