42378518,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iXRP,1452813714,"IBM Talks Open Ledger Project, Bright Future for Blockchain","When IBM, one of the largest technology firms in the world, generating nearly $100bn in 2014 revenue, announced it was interested in blockchain technology, the wider world took notice.  IBM revealed it would lend its support to the Open Ledger Project this December, an announcement that was followed by a wave of popular press proclaiming that the initiative would become a new blockchain for business, one perhaps better suited to enterprises than alternatives like bitcoin.  Organized under the umbrella of the Linux Foundation, the Open Ledger Project attracted banks, financial institutions, technology firms, as well as two blockchain startups based in New York, Digital Asset Holdings and R3CEV, the consortium that has attracted 40 major banks.  In interview, the tech giant used similarly striking language when referring to the blockchain, with IBM fellow Jerry Cuomo calling distributed ledger technology ""a fundamental way of reimagining core business processes"".  ""The art of the possible with blockchain is really what brings us to the table,"" Cuomo told CoinDesk.  Those backing the project hope that the Open Ledger Project will serve as a development library that will be tapped for use by other firms looking to build permissioned ledgers of their own.  Cuomo said:  ""We've done [proofs-of-concept] for customers with almost all of those. And I would say the world is a better place because those things were and are pioneers in the space. But we, and several others in the industry, got a twinkle in our eye looking at this and thinking [whether] this could be used for more than just cryptocurrency.""  Gathering of interest  Another key factor is IBM’s past work with the Linux Foundation, the nonprofit organization that supports the open-source Linux operating system.  Cuomo said that last year the two sides reached similar conclusions about bitcoin and the blockchain, and from that general agreement movement toward a shared project began.  ""There was a kind of perfect synchronization of thought,"" he said. ""They had already been entertaining proposals in the blockchain area.""  The gathering of various interests around the project grows out of an internal effort that has seen the deployment of several dozen employees, including developers and researchers, as part of a single team within IBM.  In the past year, the company has experimented with bitcoin and other blockchain implementations, producing public projects like ADEPT, a network for underpinning a system of interconnected devices developed in partnership with Samsung that drew elements from Ethereum.  Cuomo said other proofs-of-concept developed with IBM customers came out of those efforts.  Road ahead  A formation committee has already begun meeting, Cuomo said, and the next phase involves discussions over the Open Ledger Project’s structure; how each party will contribute and support the initiative; and the creation of subcommittees, including a technical committee on which he will sit.  According to Cuomo, the process for those contributing code to the project has already begun, which will draw from code written by IBM staff as well as code pledged by Digital Asset Holdings. The firm is also contributing the name Hyperledger, from one of two startups it acquired last year.  ""Last week we did a call for code, and it’s like, smoke ‘em if you got ‘em, so let’s put the code on the table,"" said Cuomo.  He added that the process of development coming together has already begun, saying that ""you can see folks aren’t waiting"" ahead of a more formal process.  Cuomo said that development will take place over a period of years, but expressed hope that by 2017 companies will begin developing POCs and commercial-scale products based on the Open Ledger Project.  ""History shows that these things take a while,"" he remarked, adding:  ""The bold will adopt it sooner, rollercoasters and bumps and all, and conservatives will wait for the first movers.""

42378529,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iXbT,1452801730,Study: Talent Gap Holds Back Blockchain in Capital Markets,"A new report finds that the question in capital markets is no longer whether to explore the blockchain, but how.  That’s the sentiment of this sector of enterprise finance toward the emerging technology, according to research and advisory firm Aite Group. Released in late December, the impact note is the result of interviews with technology and business strategists conducted from June to August 2015.  But while optimistic in its assessment of the industry’s views on the technology, the report identified six challenges toward its adoption in the marketplace, including, perhaps most pressingly, entrenched legacy systems and a lack of expertise in the field.  Author Gabriel Wang found that there is a “huge lack of talent” that understands both blockchain technology and capital markets, writing:  ""The market is desperately looking for individuals who can bridge the two worlds so that realistic blockchain technology implementations can take place within the context of capital markets opportunities.""  The statement comes at a time when capital markets participants such as Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) are moving forward on delving into the technology, either through proofs-of-concept or strategic investments.  Further, Wang stated that the blockchain potentially threatens the IT infrastructure of these firms, stressing that this problem is compounded by the ""hundreds of millions"" in investments made into the platforms.  ""Blockchain technology’s inability to play nice with existing legacy systems can become a huge hurdle in overall capital markets adoption,"" Wang wrote.  Other challenges mentioned in the report were the potential high electrical consumption of blockchain-based systems; the lack of regulatory clarity surrounding the technology generally; and questions about the scalability and latency of the technology.  Wang notes that there are still “many questions” about whether blockchain-based systems could handle hundreds of millions of daily transactions, wording that appears in sharp disconnect to conversations ongoing in bitcoin, where the public blockchain’s enthusiasts are locked in debate about how to increase its capacity up from seven transactions per second.  Billions saved  Still, Wang noted that even without impacting existing IT systems, the blockchain could still provide ""millions, if not, billions"" in savings to enterprise institutions by automating processes that are paper-based.  However, he noted that the total savings remains unknown given that no live examples of the technology have been implemented.  “There is also a huge question mark over how much it would actually cost to build a robust enough blockchain platform to handle the trillions of dollars that are going through the capital markets ecosystem each day,” he wrote.  But given four key market trends, Wang concludes the investment is likely to continue.  Wang cited the push for transparency following the financial crisis, the escalating costs of compliance; the downward pressure on IT spending; and a broader movement to retire legacy systems as reasons why there is institutional interest in the technology.  Overall, Aite Group projects that blockchain technology spending could reach $130m in 2016, potentially rising to as much as $400m by 2019.

42378527,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iXdz,1452793557,Class Action Lawsuit Filed Against Digital Currency Exchange Cryptsy,"Two Florida law firms have filed a class action lawsuit in US district court against digital currency exchange Cryptsy and its CEO, Paul Vernon.  Filed in the US District Court for the Southern District of Florida on 13th January, the case alleges negligence, unjust enrichment, conversion and violation of Florida’s Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act. The lawsuit was filed by Jinyao Liu, a Cryptsy customer based in Virginia.  Liu, in addition to other members of the class, is being represented by Wites & Kapetan, PA and the Silver Law Group, the latter of which filed suit in state court on behalf of a Cryptsy customer last year. That case was later settled, according to the firm.  Attorney David Silver told CoinDesk that the new suit grew out of a growing number of complaints that his firm received regarding withdrawals.  In interview, Silver highlighted that Cryptsy is registered with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), arguing that the exchange needs to be forthcoming with its customers about site issues.  He told CoinDesk:  ""As a FinCEN member, you have certain obligations, and those obligations require you to communicate with your customers. And here, customers don't know why they are being denied access to their money.""  The exchange, founded in 2013, offers a number of markets for bitcoin and alternative cryptocurrencies. Customers have complained for months that Cryptsy has withheld their withdrawals for extended periods of time, an issue the exchange has attributed to technical problems.  Vernon did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Case details  According to the complaint, the plaintiff made a deposit on 27th December, and since that date has not received a withdrawal despite repeated requests.  ""Plaintiff, on December 27, 2015, deposited 84,000,000 Dodge Coin (a commonly used cryptocurrency) to fund his CRYPTSY account. The value of that deposit, according to CRYPTSY, was approximately 33.6 BTC ($14,100.00 USD),"" the filing states.  The complaint claims that withdrawal requests were submitted on the 28th, 29th and 30th of December, as well as 2nd and 8th January, and further claims that the customer has received no funds as of the filing date.  The plaintiff goes on to state that other members of the class are in a similar situation:  ""Plaintiff’s experience with CRYPTSY is not unique. CRYPTSY has refused to honor the requests of other members of the Class, who have likewise requested to liquidate or transfer their account balances to other Money Service Businesses, only to have those requests met with silence.""  According to the filing, the plaintiff is seeking restitution and damages for an unspecified amount, as well as legal fees.  Phishing attack response  The filing of the lawsuit comes amid continued problems for the exchange. In recent days, the exchange has moved to suspend trading, most recently in response to a reported customer phishing attack.  Cryptsy later said in a 13th January blog post that an account it uses to issue text messages to customers had been compromised, but claimed that exchange's mailing service had not. The company said it was unsure how the mailing list had been obtained.  The post, attributed to Vernon, said that more details regarding the months of customer withdrawal issues would be forthcoming.  ""Regarding other issues that have been apparent at Cryptsy for the last couple months, I will be making another post to explain what has been happening in the next couple days,"" he wrote.  At press time, the exchange is reporting market trades but a notice states that all withdrawals have been cancelled and remain unavailable.

42378522,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iXSf,1452766229,7 Emerging Trends For Bitcoin and the Blockchain,"Over the holiday season, CoinDesk published a wide range of feature articles from experts and stakeholders in and outside of the bitcoin and blockchain industry.  Billed as our 2015 Review, the series encouraged guest writers – including experts on law and finance, academics, entrepreneurs and even readers – to discuss the year past and the year ahead.  Our contributors didn't always agree, but they did come up with a number of intriguing predictions, each influenced by their unique positions and experiences in the field.  In this article, we've pared down that information to define seven key trends that could shape the story of the bitcoin and blockchain industry in the coming months:  1. Blockchain apps will be released  2016 is likely to see blockchain technology move beyond discussion and into the financial market, professional services firms say.  In exclusive pieces by PwC and Deloitte, both of the firms, which are actively working with financial partners to develop proofs-of-concept (POCs), believe their work will see a wider audience this year.  In a piece entitled Blockchain Will Become a Reality in 2016, Deloitte's Eric Piscini, Simon Lapscher and Andrew Garfrerick, wrote:  ""We expect to see existing use cases for blockchain technology come to life, completely new use cases emerge, and an increased number of joint product launches mostly from financial institutions and blockchain startups.""  Many of the standard financial services use cases (such as international payments, trade settlement, compliance, etc) will slowly be turned into fully fledged products in the next 12 months, they predicted.  ""Whether it is through internal blockchain labs, direct partnership with blockchain tech companies or through collaborations with platforms such as Deloitte’s own Rubix, many of the main financial institutions are now past the thinking and ‘testing-the-waters’ stage, and into the product development stage,"" wrote Piscini, Lapscher and Garfrerick.  However, some still believe there’s a lot of work still to do before blockchains come into common usage.  Preston Byrne, co-founder and COO of Eris Industries, wrote in his piece that we’re two budget cycles away from the first production systems in finance, and that we’re probably 10 years away from mainstream use.  2. Regulatory scrutiny of applications will increase  This past year has seen an enthusiastic spike in activity as major financial institutions have moved to experiment with bitcoin and develop blockchain applications.  However, it remains to be seen how these use cases will be impacted by regulation, which to date has largely focused bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.  In CoinDesk's 4 Trends That Will Shape Bitcoin Regulation in 2016, Jason Weinstein and Alan Cohn, both US attorneys and counsels to the Blockchain Alliance, wrote:  ""[As] more 'traditional' service providers move to blockchain-based applications, look for regulatory agencies in particular to stake out their territory, first through surveys and informational meetings, but then through targeted investigations and perhaps even enforcement actions.""  Indeed, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is to discuss the application of blockchain technology in derivatives markets during a meeting of its Technology Advisory Committee later this month.  Weinstein and Cohn predicted that maintaining positive engagement will help government agencies develop a better understanding of the benefits of bitcoin and the blockchain.  This will ""help foster an approach to enforcement and regulation that supports innovation and growth, so this transformative technology can reach new heights in 2016 – and beyond"", they wrote.  3. Bitcoin the currency will continue to grow  Michael Jackson, former COO of Skype and board member at bitcoin wallet provider Blockchain, expressed confidence in bitcoin and its potential to grow to mass adoption in his article Bitcoin's Big Challenge in 2016: Reaching 100 Million Users.  Bitcoin can grow to rival the usage figures boasted by globally popular apps such as Snapchat, Facebook and Twitter, he suggested.  ""Despite our lack of progress, we have something precious. Anecdotally, I can’t think of a single other back-end system that has been online for seven years without a glitch, running 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. The bitcoin blockchain has proven its resilience,"" he wrote.  However, he identified a significant challenge facing the digital currency and warned that bitcoin firms must ""successfully obfuscate the complexity of bitcoin and bring frictionless value transfer to the next 100 million daily users"".  4. Interest in use cases outside payments will pick up  2015 was the year that many banks and financial institutions report they began to see the potential of blockchains and distributed ledgers, and these groups flocked to set up their own research projects or joined consortia to investigate how their businesses might be impacted.  However, the ability of blockchains to cryptographically verify and record transactions, is starting to find appeal across a number of other industries.  Most notably, perhaps, insurance firms are starting to investigate blockchain technology, with Accenture, Lloyd's and Allianz France all recently stating an interest.  Michael Mainelli, executive chairman of Z/Yen Group and principal advisor to Long Finance,tackled this subject in a piece entitled Why Insurers Caught the Blockchain Bug in 2015.  Noting that these groups have interests that may lead them to consider decentralized technologies, Mainelli said:  ""The hundreds of firms in the London markets are rightly concerned about a central third party who might hold their information to ransom. They want to avoid natural monopolies, particularly as agreed information is crucial over multi-year contracts.""  He added that Z/Yen, a commercial think-tank, has already built insurance application prototypes for clients in areas such as motor and small business.  The piece was later echoed by Abizer Rangwala, a managing director for Accenture, who would write that he believes the insurance industry will move to embrace the technology within the ""next few years"".  Provenance – or the tracking of ownership – was also cited as a use case that would see further growth this year.  The digital tokens that a blockchain could, proponents say, can also be used as digitized representations of the documents that accompany financial transactions or goods on a supply line.  There are numerous use cases within finance, where many processes involve the processing of shared documents between various parties. Beyond finance, a blockchain can provide a full audit trail of a piece of data's origin in both time and place. In this way, a blockchain can act as a provenance protocol for data across disparate semi-trusting organizations.  In a recent real-world example, there is even a startup calling itself Provenance that is aiming to use blockchains to build more transparency into supply chains.  5. Bitcoin's price will continue its recent rally through 2016  ""Assuming that bitcoin remains the most popular token to run the blockchain and transaction volumes continue to rise, the next few years should be spectacular for the price of bitcoin,"" said Richelle Ross, an independent cryptocurrency consultant.  In her piece for CoinDesk, Why I'm Predicting a $650 Bitcoin in 2016, Ross suggested that 2016 will be more ""action-packed"" than last year, anticipating positive price moves associated with the digital currency's maturing infrastructure and the block halving due this summer, where the amount of bitcoins awarded to miners roughly every 10 minutes will be cut in half.  Warning that there are ""too many unknown factors when predicting price to know with any certainty"", she concluded that the price will finish the year around the $650 mark.  The topic of the coming rewards halving was also brought up in ""2016 Could Be Bitcoin's Best Year Yet"" by Adamant Research's Tuur Demester.  There, Demester said he expects the event to have a ""positive"" impact on bitcoin, though he stopped short of any direct price predictions.  6. Consortia will prove to be important  With such a recent and innovative technology to come to grips with, many established institutions, startups and regulatory agencies have found partnering to be the most promising way forward.  Deloitte's experts suggested this trend will likely increase this year, as companies try to leverage the capabilities of partners to help drive critical research and development of new blockchain use cases.  Additionally, they wrote: ""Certain firms also look to provide 'network leadership' within the space – that is, to help connect the dots between different players within the ecosystem who may benefit from large forums in which to market themselves and share knowledge.""  New York-based R3 already leads a group of more than 40 financial institutions, aiming to drive innovation and standards in financial services. Other working organizations, including one focused on post-trade settlement, have also emerged in recent months.  Still, not everyone agrees.  Nomura Research Institute  , for example, has suggested the slow advancement of such efforts could make private POCs more attractive.  7. VC money will flow to blockchain startups  Venture funds are increasingly noticing enterprise interest in blockchain, and despite big early bets that bitcoin may prove to be a disruptive in the space, seem more and more keen to back startups aiding banks in their research.  As evidenced by the trends above, VCs see opportunities for startups in partnering with institutions or providing incidental services around the periphery of this new tech, including blockchain APIs and ID verification services.  This is likely to draw in investors who see the potential for blockchains and want to get in early.  Virtual Capital Ventures' William Mougayar forecast that VC investments in blockchain-related startups will exceed $2.5bn all-time in 2016 – dwarfing even the most optimistic of estimates for bitcoin startups in 2015. This doesn't include what the banks will spend from their operating budgets, either.  Already this year we've seen signs existing bitcoin startups are changing gears as well.  Gem, which pivoted focus from bitcoin APIs to more general blockchain versions of this product, has closed a $7.1m Series A funding round led by Pelion Venture Partners.  There is a caveat, however, startups shouldn't assume a windfall is likely just because they deal with the blockchain.  Digital Asset Holdings, the startup led by respected ex-JPMorgan exec Blythe Masters, is apparently having issues closing its inaugural investment round.
