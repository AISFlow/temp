42400435,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJYhH,1505513131,Meet WEX: Bitcoin Exchange Launches for BTC-e Users with BTC-e Design,"BTC-e appears to have successfully launched a new bitcoin exchange platform.  Announced today via Twitter, WEX is allegedly the result of a months-long effort by the bitcoin exchange to return service to customers after it was raided and fined by US authorities in July. But despite its new URL, the WEX website notably mirrors the old BTC-e website in design, functionality and trading pair options.  Further, in a welcome message on its new website, WEX sought to differentiate itself from the BTC-e website, claiming that it is unrelated to that company. Despite having migrated over all the exchange's former users, the platform claims the technical teams behind the exchanges are different.  Adding to the claims is that the new website stated that it did not receive any funds from BTC-e, while at the same time alleging that it would abide by anti-money laundering and know-your-customer laws.  In the welcome message:  ""We thank all ex-users of BTC-E for their patience at such a difficult moment for all of you guys. We on our part have spent a lot of efforts and energy to create a new platform for trade in the shortest time limits.""  For the next three to seven business days, WEX will operate in a test-mode. Users will receive bonus crypto-tokens for transferring balances.  Still, the result is a follow-through on previous claims by BTC-e. The original website announced on Thursday that the ""address of the new platform [would] be announced in btc-e twitter [sic]."") Further, BTC-e said in August that it would relaunch on September 15.  Upcoming steps in its relaunch process include restructuring its assets and undergoing an audit to confirm the new exchange is in compliance with laws and regulations for money exchanges.

42400438,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJYkE,1505506563,"China, Shmyna: Bitcoin Trading Is Way More Distributed Now Anyway","Marc Hochstein is the managing editor for CoinDesk and a former editor-in-chief of American Banker.  In this opinion piece, Hochstein takes a quick look at the current state of the bitcoin markets, finding that just because there's smoke, there's not necessarily fire.      Tl;dr: this ain't Mt. Gox – and bitcoin survived that, too.  With all the panic selling following the Chinese government's renewed crackdown on bitcoin exchanges, it's important to remember that the country is no longer the trading hub it once was.  All else equal, that means the market may take less time to recover from the latest sell-off than from the one that took place in 2013 (you know, when the People's Bank of China suddenly declared that bitcoin was not a currency and ordered payment processors to stop accepting it).  Just a reminder of how bad the fallout from that that really was, during the three years it took bitcoin to recover from those bombshells, it lost nearly half its value, dropping from an all-time high of $1,150 to under $500.  But that was at a time when Chinese bitcoin trading accounted for as much as 90% of global volume (as shown in the chart below from CoinDesk's second-quarter State of Blockchain report.)  This state of affairs persisted until as recently as January of this year:  Since then, however, China's share of bitcoin trading volume has fallen dramatically.  This is likely for two reasons: China's January ban on no-fee trading on the country’s exchanges dramatically reduced volume there; and the rise of trading volumes in Japan and South Korea as shown in the chart below:  ""Global trading volume now appears more distributed than ever before,"" our State of Blockchain report noted in June.  Remember also, this time around there hasn't been any formal guidance from government – and it appears local exchanges Huobi and OKCoin will continue letting users trade between cryptocurrencies. In short, this is far from a blanket ban.  Of course, there are many variables that influence the price of bitcoin, so there is no guarantee of a speedier recovery.  But thanks to this more diversified market, and in context, still limited action, it stands to reason that the regulatory interventions of a single country (even the world's most populous country) should have less impact on the bitcoin price over the long term.

42400424,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJYWS,1505495724,Geth Releases Software Update Ahead of Ethereum 'Byzantium' Hard Fork,"A new version of ethereum's Geth node software has been released, which includes support for the upcoming ""Byzantium"" upgrade as well as a series of performance enhancements.  Named Megara, the freshly-coded Geth release has been reformatted to include all improvements developed for Byzantium, which forms the first of two parts in the wider ""Metropolis"" update. Ethereum is currently on target to activate the Byzantium hard fork within the next month.  It notably includes a formal block number for the launch of Byzantium on Ropsten, the ethereum testnet. Previously set for September 18, the block number is now officially 1,700,000, which looks likely to be reached in roughly seven days.  On top of featuring compatibility with the Byzantium improvements, new performance enhancements have been introduced to the software. Among those are steps to cut the amount of data storage required by a node from 26.3GB to 14.9GB – making ethereum significantly lighter to run. Updated nodes will also be able to process contracts faster, with filtering times reduced from minutes to under a second.  Some updates are yet to be finalized, but promise to eventually reduce the bandwidth requirement of the underlying peer-to-peer protocol from 33.6GB to 13.5GB. Further, a memory-caching improvement should increase in speed by a ""couple orders of magnitude,"" the release states.  Megera also includes an improved transaction pool. In the earlier version of Geth, high-paying transactions were prioritized indiscriminately – but, in this new version, a Geth user's own transaction will always receive priority, regardless of whether it contains fewer funds.  For enhanced security, new protective measures on the transaction disk enforce that a backup be created for local transactions in case of a node crashing. Further, Geth will now also support the Trezor line of hardware wallets.

42400415,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJWLf,1505492117,Courting Bitcoin? Nebraska Ethics Board Gives Lawyers OK to Accept,"Lawyers in Nebraska can now accept cryptocurrency as payment, according to a new advisory opinion published by an ethics committee appointed by the state's supreme court.  The Lawyers' Advisory Committee is an eight-member body that responds to queries from lawyers in Nebraska, weighing them against the state's Rules of Professional Conduct. The opinion itself is novel, constituting the first time that a state ethics body has considered a question related to cryptocurrency payments.  According to the advisory, dated September 11, the request focused on three elements: whether an attorney can receive cryptocurrencies like bitcoin as payment; whether directly from a client or from a third party; and whether they can hold cryptocurrencies in escrow or trust on behalf of the client. The answer, the document outlines, is largely yes – with some caveats.  Citing a requirement that no client may be charged too high a fee, the committee said that, while a lawyer may accept a cryptocurrency, it must immediately be converted to U.S. dollars.  This, the committee argued, would ""mitigate the risk of volatility and possible unconscionable overpayment for services.""  For third-party payments, the opinion stipulates that they can be accepted ""so long as the payment prevents possible interference with the attorney's independent relationship with the client."" Further, the lawyer must identify the party sending the payment.  The Advisory Committee gave its approval to the question on holding cryptocurrencies in escrow, as they ""are property rather than actual currency,"" as long as the holdings are kept separate from the lawyer's own property. They must be safeguarded, according to the opinion, and records need to be kept for a five-year period.  Notably, the document calls for the use of multi-signature wallets to keep funds held in escrow more secure.  ""Other reasonable measures may include maintenance of the wallet in a computer or other storage device that is disconnected from the Internet (also known as ""cold storage""), a method that would also allow for off-line storage of one or more private keys,"" the opinion adds.

42400423,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJWNd,1505487926,"Back at $3,500: Has Bitcoin's Price Found a Short-Term Bottom?","The sell-off in the bitcoin-US dollar exchange rate (BTC/USD) appears to have stalled, with prices trading at $3,550 at press time.  Over the course of a volatile day, the cryptocurrency fell to a low of $2,980 oversold technical conditions came into play, as we discussed early today.  As per CoinMarketCap, the digital currency has lost 2% over the last 24 hours.  Bitcoin may have found a short-term bottom  The previous article had talked about a potential bullish price RSI divergence on the 4-hour chart. Well, the 4-hour chart is yet to confirm the bullish divergence, however, it has been confirmed on the 1-hour chart.  1-hour chart  The chart above shows the bullish price RSI divergence (lower lows on the price chart and higher lows on the RSI).  The bullish pattern on the 1-hour chart indicates that bitcoin sell-off has run out of steam for now. Prices could test $3,550-3,600, which is the resistance offered by the downward sloping trend line.  Avoid being over ambitious  The bullish setup on the 1-hour chart is valid for a couple of hours. Bitcoin is unlikely to see significant gains above $3,550-3,600 as the Stochastics is close to being overbought.  Watch out for a bullish divergence on the 4-hour chart  The argument that bitcoin has found a short-term bottom at $2,980 would gain more credence if the bullish-price RSI divergence is confirmed on the 4-hour chart.  Bitcoin is likely to consolidate largely in the range of $3,100 to $3,600. Markets seem to have priced-in the bearish news out of China. Unless there is more damaging news out of China, the range is not likely to be breached to the downside.

42400413,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJWJh,1505484884,"Huobi, OKCoin to Stop Yuan-to-Bitcoin Trading By October's End","Chinese bitcoin exchanges Huobi and OKCoin – two of the country's ""Big Three"" markets – have announced that they will halt yuan-denominated trading by the end of October.  The twin statements indicate that, at least for now, the exchanges will continue to offer cryptocurrency-to-cryptocurrency trading services. That said, both exchanges are halting yuan deposits starting today.  According to Huobi and OKCoin, definitive information about the trading suspension will be circulated to users before September 30. More significantly, the exchanges will undertake a ""gradual"" process of unwinding its yuan-denominated markets, with an eye to complete that process by October 31.  The news comes after fellow China-based exchanges BTCC, ViaBTC and Yunbi all announced that they would shut their doors, citing statements from domestic regulators earlier this month. In the wake of BTCC's closure yesterday, both Huobi and OKCoin said that they had not received any notices or instructions to close.  Yet this morning, leaked documents indicated that verbal directives had been given to some exchanges regarding their closure. Notably among those instructions was the stipulation that user data be preserved and provided to the government. Cryptocurrency prices, in turn, saw continued turmoil in the wake of those developments.  The move to halt yuan-to-crypto trading represents a new phase in the ongoing saga around cryptocurrency regulation in China.  Earlier this month, China put a freeze on its domestic initial coin offering (ICO) space, declaring it an illegal form of fundraising. Exchanges and other websites providing ICO-related services subsequently moved to accommodate the new rules amidst the fallout, with investors in previously held ICOs set to be refunded their money.  That move came months after regulators in China moved to impose new anti-money laundering restrictions on the country's exchanges. In early 2017, the People's Bank of China made waves when it was revealed that officials had met with the leaders of the country's major bitcoin exchanges, followed by meetings with other representatives of the ecosystem and a months-long withdrawal freeze amid the upgrades.

42400399,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJW6u,1505482213,Yunbi Bitcoin Exchange Latest to Close in China Crackdown,"Another China-based cryptocurrency exchange, Yunbi, has announced the closure of its trading operations in the midst of a wider crackdown within the country.

42400417,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJWMe,1505479170,Market Turmoil Pushes Cryptocurrency Market Cap Below $100 Billion,"The total value of all cryptocurrencies below $100 billion this morning amid new developments out of China.  That figure dropped to as low as $98.95 billion, down from $179 billion just two weeks ago – a fall of 47.7 percent, according to CoinMarketCap data. That loss has been driven by broad declines across the top-10 cryptocurrency markets, with ethereum classic, litecoin and bitcoin cash being hardest hit among those in the top-10 list. Each of those markets is showing 24-hour declines in excess of 15 percent.  Since that slide below $100 billion, the market has recovered somewhat, hovering around $108.8 billion at press time.  Of course, most eyes are on bitcoin today, the news is not good.  Having topped out at a spectacular all-time high of $5,013 on September 1, prices have since continued to drop amid likely profit-taking by traders and, more recently, the crackdown on cryptocurrency exchanges by the People's Bank of China and other authorities in the country.  Already two China-based exchanges – BTCC and ViaBTC – have announced they will close this week in compliance with the authorities' statement, and a new document revealed this morning suggests that all other exchanges in the country will have to follow suit.  With China being a major location for bitcoin trading globally, this all is having a strong affect on prices, and today saw a five-week low of $2,951, having started the session at $3,226. At press time, bitcoin's price had recovered, rising back to $3,291.00 according to the BPI.  Bitcoin's market capitalization has also fallen as a result, now sitting at roughly $53 billion – down from $81.9 billion on September 2, according to CoinMarketCap.

42400418,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJWPb,1505478616,"Blame China? Bitcoin Price Seeks Bottom Below $3,000","The bitcoin-US dollar exchange rate (BTC/USD) is in freefall after Chinese bitcoin exchange ViaBTC became the second exchange to shut down domestic trading amid news more announcements are forthcoming.  As per CoinMarketCap, the bitcoin price has lost more than 20% of its value in the last 24 hours.  Week-on-week, the world's largest cryptocurrency is down 29%. On a monthly basis, BTC has lost 28%. Perhaps even more notably, the price of bitcoin has shed almost $1,000 over the last 48 hours.  For a time, it appeared that the oversold intraday technical conditions could yield a relief rally to $3,700 levels. However, the bulls continued to exit the market on fears other exchanges would close down their Chinese desks.  More announcements are now only likely to amplify fears and trigger further selling.  USD strength to complicate matters  When discussing cryptocurrencies, the other side of the story, i.e. the US dollar, is often ignored.  While the record rally to $5,000 levels was more due to bullish bitcoin stories (SegWit activation, heightened institutional interest), the fact that the greenback was being sold across the board isn't a mere coincidence.  Dollar Index and BTC/USD Comparison chart  The chart above shows the Dollar Index topped out in early January, around the time that bitcoin began its record rally in mid January.  By no means are we trying to suggest that bitcoin rally was the result of USD weakness, but the chart does suggest that the broad based USD sell-off could have amplified the bitcoin rally.  Forex market experts are calling for an interim bottom in the dollar index as the China reflation story is gathering pace again. The US also reported a higher inflation number on Thursday, which means the Fed could maintain its gradual pace of policy tightening.  Again, a strong US dollar does not mean bitcoin would continue to fall. However, it would certainly amplify the bearish move or make it difficult for the digital currency to revisit its yearly high of $5,000  Is there a scope for recovery in bitcoin?  Technical studies say the sell-off is overdone and bitcoin is poised for a minor relief rally.  Daily chart  As seen on the chart above, both RSI and Stochastics are oversold [under 30.00], which means an extended price move to the downside. When price reaches these extreme levels [under 30.00], a reversal is possible.  4-hour chart  Both RSI and Stochastics are extremely oversold. A minor recovery could confirm a bullish divergence, which occurs when price forms lower lows, while the oscillator (in this case RSI and Stochastics) forms higher lows.  The bullish divergence would be confirmed if the current or the next 4-hour candle hits fresh lows, but ends on a positive note.  A minor technical correction could follow, although fresh offers could hit bitcoin around the falling trend line 1.  Key levels to watch  Weekly chart  View  The oversold nature of the daily indicators suggests potential for a corrective rally to $3,300-$3,400  The sell-off could be easily extended to $2,350 if Chinese exchanges continue to shut down BTC trading desks.  A rally back to $5,000 would be easier said than done as the US dollar seems to have found a footing. Seasonality study shows, the greenback is usually strong in the third and fourth quarter.

According to both leaked documents and statements from local exchange executives, issued on condition of anonymity, China’s regulators have now issued verbal directives indicating how they expect the businesses to wind down operations due to the fact that they are operating domestically without a formal license.  A document leaked on Chinese social media, translated below, lists a series of steps the exchanges must undergo during that closure. While not received directly by exchange executives surveyed, the document is reportedly consistent with verbal guidance.  Issued by the office of the Leading Group of Beijing Internet Financial Risks Remediation, the document outlines how exchanges will need to coordinate with local regulators following their announcements, listing how they should handle customer data and banking relationships.  Already, however, two exchanges – BTCC and ViaBTC – have announced their closure, both citing the regulatory statement issued by authorities on September 5.  BTCC, in the wake of the announcement, posted a series of tweets about user withdrawals, stating that they will be able to get their money out even after the September 30 closure date. In one of those tweets, the exchange suggested that users ""withdraw their funds as quickly as possible.""  While not all China-based exchanges have formally indicated that they will shut down, one exchange executive indicated that more announcements will be forthcoming in light of the order. Exchanges Huobi and OKCoin are said to have met with regulators today, and are expected to announce plans to shut down within hours.  Representatives from Huobi and OKCoin did not respond to requests for comment at press time.  The full translated document reads:    1.

42400405,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJWBp,1505473242,Trumping the IRS: Could the Timing Be Right for Bitcoin Tax Reform?,"President Donald Trump's push to overhaul the U.S. tax code could include a potential payoff for bitcoin users.  With the president and the Republican Party's sights set on tax reform as a way to send a strong message to voters ahead of the 2018 term elections, it's potentially a good time for a bill easing the tax reporting requirements for cryptocurrency to be included in a final package.  Since the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) 2014 decision that cryptocurrencies should be treated for tax purposes as property, the agency has been met with criticism for not adequately instructing consumers on how to report based on this conclusion.  And the Cryptocurrency Fairness in Taxation Act (CFTA), introduced earlier this month, aims to push the IRS into doing just that.  ""The bill is kind of a reaction to the 2014 IRS decision that classified cryptocurrencies as property, and that means they're subject to capital gains tax,"" said Eve Lieberman, chief of staff to Representative Jared Polis, who with David Schweikert, introduced the bill.  By aspiring to make cryptocurrency transactions under $600 exempt from IRS reporting requirements, the bill would also require the IRS to provide additional guidance to customers on how they should report transactions above that threshold.  Speaking at a recent workshop on cryptocurrency taxation in Washington D.C., Lieberman said members of the Blockchain Caucus, which Polis and Schweikert co-chair, are strategically introducing the bill to the House of Representative's Ways and Means Committee (responsible for taxation matters) before the drafting of tax reform starts rolling.  By getting the bill in front of Congress soon, the caucus believes they'll be able to get the bill into the president's final tax reform proposal.  Lieberman said:  ""We need guidance in this area. There is a lack of clarity. This is an emerging technology, and good-intending taxpayers want to obey the law but they can't because there's this barrier [to compliance].""  Onerous requirements  For the Blockchain Caucus, the bill is a way to pressure the IRS into giving lawful, well-meaning cryptocurrency users the necessary tools to fulfill their tax reporting obligations.  And there are big challenges to this today. Case and point is the fact that only 802 Coinbase users reported capital gains from bitcoin on their 2016 taxes, a figured disclosed by the IRS in legal filings related to its ""John Doe"" summons of the exchange's user information.  Jonathan Johnson, chairman of Overstock – which accepts payments in more than 50 different cryptocurrencies – said a chief reason for this is that compliance with the existing IRS guidance is extremely difficult, if not impossible, for most bitcoin users and businesses.  ""Overstock is able to do it because we have scores of people on our finance team. Some people are charged with knowing the price of each bitcoin when it came in, how long we hold it and the price when we use it. That's complicated,"" Johnson said, during the workshop.  Further, Johnson suggested the IRS's decision to treat bitcoin as property has not only reduced its utility as a payment system, but also has inflated its value as a speculative instrument.  Johnson said:  ""Frankly, I think that’s what’s helping to create what I would say is a premature acceleration in the price of bitcoin, because people view crypto as investment rather than currency.""  In its defense, the IRS has stated it has not had sufficient resources to devote toward clarifying its cryptocurrency reporting guidelines.  However, Amy Kim, global policy director and general council at the Chamber of Digital Commerce, suggested the John Doe summons of Coinbase user information sends a different message.  ""The IRS didn’t have the resources to apply to additional guidance, however, they clearly have resources to battle away on the enforcement side and in court,"" she said.  Victory in sight?  While there are no guarantees the CFTA will make it into the final tax reform bill, having cryptocurrency taxation language drafted and on the discussion table is significant, particularly since Schweikert serves on the Ways and Means Committee.  Equally encouraging, the bill has not drawn any outcry from the more Luddite members of Congress.  ""Usually when you introduce legislation you want to line up supporters and make sure you know the risks and benefits before introducing some legislation. There haven't been any opponents to this legislation, and it's gotten a lot of recognition, so I think that speaks for itself,"" Lieberman explained.  And as President Trump and other Republicans look to change voter opinions about their lack of success so far, Grover Norquist, president of non-profit Americans for Tax Reform, said Republicans will look to develop a tax package that's much stronger and more sweeping then would be otherwise necessary.  Norquist said:  ""These guys get that if they want to come back in the majority, they need the biggest, whoop-ass, toughest tax cut they can pass as soon as possible.""  And as the cryptocurrency community continues to grow, reform in this area could be an advantageous target for politicians looking to secure more votes.  Democrats could also be in support of the bill, even though they've to date stonewalled most of the president's legislative priorities, since the party doesn't want to appear like they're opposed cutting taxes.  Jonathan Williams, vice president and chief economist at the American Legislative Exchange Council, contends the tax reform bill will be finalized and signed into law by the year's end, which puts significant pressure on the Blockchain Caucus to get the CFTA in front on Congress member's eyes sooner than later.  A back door  While Lieberman isn't as optimistic that tax reform will be a slam dunk, she hinted at other channels available by which CFTA could advance.  For instance, one common means is the so-called ""omnibus spending bill,"" which joins together smaller, regular appropriations bills into a single package, and is generally passed each year in December before Congress adjourns for the Christmas season.  Lierberman contends:  ""Things in Congress move by getting attached to large pieces of legislation at the end of the year, so this could be attached to some spending bill or some other legislation. I tend to think a lot of things just pass in the omnibus package at the end of the year.""  While this commonly used way to attach and ultimately pass into law unrelated pieces of legislation – known as ""policy riders"" – is not without controversy, in this instance, it could prove a critical conduit for advancing the wider adoption of cryptocurrencies.

According to The Sun newspaper, Kennedy, who used the name Alex Green while operating the exchange, denied eight charges of fraud, fraudulent trading and money laundering.  Kennedy is alleged to have stolen in excess of £1 million ($1.33 million) in bitcoin during 2014, in an investigation that has been led by British authorities over three years.  In what is reportedly the first case of fraud involving cryptocurrency to be held within the U.K. legal system, Kennedy appeared in a Bristol court via a video link from the city jail, where he is currently serving time for rape. Prosecutors described the case as a ""very complex and sophisticated fraud,"" according to The Sun.  The Moolah exchange was a popular platform for buying and selling dogecoin, now the 49th-largest cryptocurrency. Kennedy later purchased the exchange MintPal, which collapsed in late 2014 following growing allegations of fraud.

42400406,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJWCo,1505466017,Fujitsu to Trial Blockchain Tech with New Banking Partners,"Fujitsu, Japan's largest IT equipment and services provider, is partnering with the Japanese Bankers Association (JBA) in a bid to test the viability of running financial services on a blockchain platform.  The JBA assesses the effectiveness of payment systems and provides guidance to banks on various issues, including how to utilize new technologies to improve services. Its membership comprises banks, bank holding institutions and smaller banking associations.  With the new deal, Fujitsu will provide a blockchain platform, built on the open-source Hyperledger Fabric code base, that individual banks within the JBA's ranks can then use to test various business use cases.  The association said in a press release:  ""JBA will provide its Collaborative Blockchain Platform to its member banks and other institutions as a testbed environment for applications employing blockchain technology, such as for settlement and funds transfer services, and identity and time-of-transaction authentication.""  Starting next month, member banks will begin developing their own applications for the platform, testing out various ideas to determine which are viable for implementation on a real-world basis.  As such, the JBA's members join an increasing number of banks that are testing out blockchain technology as a base for financial services.  Just this week, a joint venture between Ripple Labs and Japanese financial services firm SBI announced it will soon start testing its blockchain-based funds-transfer system between Japanese and South Korean banks.

42400409,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJWGk,1505462408,From Bear to Bull: Bitcoin Just Won't Die (So Josh Brown Buys),"""Why won't you die?""  That's what Josh Brown, money manager and CEO of Ritholtz Wealth Management, kept asking himself as he watched the price of bitcoin rise and rise.  After years of skepticism toward cryptocurrency, Brown finally relented, buying bitcoin for the first time in July. And yet, at the very moment prices were soaring, news about the number one cryptocurrency by market capitalization turned negative.  ""People were saying [about the scaling debate], 'This is going to be the thing that really kills bitcoin.' But the price action was saying the opposite,"" Brown recalls.  And as he watched the cryptocurrency not only recover from, but rally after its scaling debate came to a head, he turned from bear to bull.  A frequent commentator on CNBC and mandatory reading for anyone who follows ""Finance Twitter,"" Brown said that kind of scenario isn't just a one-off.  He told CoinDesk:  ""One of the things I've learned in the investing world is that very often the thing that's supposed to break an asset class is the thing that truly strengthens it.""  Household parallels  According to Brown, there's a clear parallel in the European stock markets: while Brexit was ballyhooed as the death of the European Union, it's actually forced the bloc to become more tightly knit.  Overall, he refers to these seemingly pessimistic instances often, and it's what he uses as an investment thesis of sorts. When an asset seems like it should die, but for years on end it finds a market – even if you're not part of its core demographic – it's often time to give it a closer look, he said.  ""I felt that way about Facebook. I wanted it to die. I thought 'Enough! This is so stupid.' I just wanted it to die... And now? I'm on Facebook all day,"" he said.  Brown had the same aversion to Netflix as well, seeing it as an unnecessary application. But what he found was that sometimes it depends not on what people need, but what they want, and users wanted Netflix.  One of the primary criticisms Brown said he hears from investors who are bearish on the crypto asset market is that cryptocurrency is a ""solution in search of a problem."" And while Brown believes they could be right for now, in the very near future, crypto, like Facebook and Netflix, could find a problem to solve.  He offers another example in cloud computing, which started out as a solution in search of a problem.  In the early days of cloud computing, the technology was fraught with privacy and availability concerns – and the dominant paradigm at the time was that it was crazy to allow your mission critical business data to be hosted off-site.  And now? Brown answers rhetorically: ""Who has a mainframe in a server room in their office?""  Winner and losers  That doesn't mean every cool, bleeding-edge technology will pan out, though, said Brown.  The important takeaway from his analysis is that many technologies seem like toys – or are just totally useless – until an important use case is found and broadly applied.  And one area where Brown sees a great deal of promise for cryptocurrency is in the securities industry, which he already knows quite well.  If you buy stock today, it takes three days for the trade to settle – meaning it takes three days to process the payment and for the broker to take custody of the security.  ""That makes absolutely no sense in the context of the things we're able to do instantaneously,"" he contended.  Brown said he doesn't have a crystal ball to determine exactly what the solution will be – whether it will be cryptocurrency, blockchain or a solution influenced by those technologies – but the idea the technology could have an impact is beginning to make the brokerage business collectively rethink its old paradigms.  In this way, Brown acknowledges his own past skepticism.  ""I ignored it. I didn't take it seriously. I ridiculed it at times,"" he said.  In a sense, Brown's evolution on crypto echoes a line attributed to Mahatma Ghandi that cryptocurrency enthusiasts have been fond of for years:  ""First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.""  Lingering doubt  All that said, Brown is still not a wild-eyed optimist.  Putting most of his skepticism into initial coin offerings (ICOs), or cryptocurrency-based fundraising, Brown thinks it's going to ""blow up in everyone's face.""  He can't imagine why legitimate companies would fund themselves by offering access to investors via an ICO – unless they had something to hide, or the companies were simply of such poor quality that an initial public offering or a venture round wasn't an option. Although, to be fair, the venture capital space can be a tough nut to crack.  But Brown still thinks he's right to a certain extent, reiterating that many of his initial criticisms about cryptocurrency turned out to be correct.  He said:  ""A lot of the stuff I felt about it [that] it's going to be a Wild West, and it's unregulated and there are hacks and it's dangerous – all of that was right. I was completely right about it. But what I didn't see happening was that it wasn't going to die.""  So now Brown tells his money management clients who ask his thoughts to go read, research and form their own opinion about the space.  ""It's so easy to look at something that you're not a part of and you don't understand, and just point at it and say, 'BUBBLE!!!'"" Brown said.  But what he's not doing anymore is dismissing it out of hand.
