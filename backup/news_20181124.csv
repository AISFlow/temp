42402280,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3ly2,1543102210,Below $4K: Bitcoin Price Hits 400-Day Lows,"The price of bitcoin fell below $4,000 for the first time today since September 27th of last year.  At around 16:20 UTC Saturday, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization sank to an average price across exchanges of $3,970.43, a figure 7.5 percent lower than the day's opening price of $4,298.83, according to Coindesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.  At $3,745.89 as of press time, BTC’s price is now down more than $1,700, or 30 percent, in the past seven days alone and 81 percent from its all-time high of roughly $20,000, set back in December.  While several well-known cryptocurrencies are posting positive 24-hour price developments when valued against BTC, including the likes of XRP (XRP), ethereum (ETH) and dash (DASH) which are all up more than 2 percent in BTC terms, the broader market is still experiencing substantial losses vs. the USD.  Out of the world’s 10 largest cryptocurrencies, bitcoin cash (BCH), stellar (XLM), monero (XMR) and cardano (ADA) are the worst performers, all reporting 24-hour losses above 10 percent (vs. USD), according to data from Coinmarketcap.  An effect of the plummet in cryptocurrency prices is a significant depreciation in the capitalization of the entire market. Just seven days ago, the market was valued at $182 billion, but that number has since fallen $54 billion, or 30 percent to where it now stands at $128 billion, its lowest value since September 2017.

""Yes,"" he says. ""It wasn't a voice I recognize."" He added, ""It could be ... ""  Then a quick burst of static made his next words inaudible.  It was a strange incident, but apparently not a new experience for Stallman, whose emails urge any NSA or FBI agents reading to ""follow Snowden's example"" and blow the whistle.  Stallman seems to check all of the old school cypherpunk boxes: in addition to being an Edward Snowden admirer, he's a hacker of the original '70s and '80s generation, a privacy activist, and a frequent invoker of liberty. As a result, cryptocurrency enthusiasts could be forgiven for thinking Stallman was also head-over-heels for bitcoin.  He's not.  Before his oration on libertarianism was interrupted, he said that the right-wingers who made up a significant portion of bitcoin's early adopters don't really deserve the label. His own pro-freedom views are more ""libertarian"" than bitcoiners' ""anti-socialism,"" he argued.  As we spoke, it became clear that Stallman doesn't find the decade-old technology all that appealing, for more reasons than just politics.  ""I have never used it myself,"" he told CoinDesk.  If that's surprising, keep in mind that fine distinctions matter a great deal to Stallman. For example, he wrote a 9,000-word explainer on the difference between the terms GNU and Linux.  In 40-ish words: GNU, which Stallman proposed in 1983, is an operating system using exclusively free software. Linux, created years later by Linus Torvalds, is a kernel. Many refer to packages combining the two as ""Linux,"" but Stallman insists that the proper term is GNU/Linux or just GNU.  He also wrote 3,000 words on the differences between free software and open source software. Advocates of both push for the freedom to use, study, change and redistribute software, but Stallman said that those similarities conceal ""a deeply important moral disagreement"" centered on freedom and human rights, which the free software movement stresses.  The GNU Project, which Stallman founded, is working on an alternative digital payments system called Taler, which is based on cryptography but is not – forgive the hair-splitting – a cryptocurrency.  The Taler project's maintainer Christian Grothoff told CoinDesk that the system is, rather, designed for a ""post-blockchain"" world.  Concerned with privacy...  It doesn't even seem like the technology has been around long enough to already be thinking of a world after it, but to Stallman, bitcoin isn't suitable as a digital payment system.  His biggest complaint: bitcoin's poor privacy protections.  He told CoinDesk, ""What I'd really like is a way to make purchases anonymously from various kinds of stores, and unfortunately it wouldn't be feasible for me with bitcoin.""  Using a crypto exchange would allow that company and ultimately the government to identify him, he said. And as for mining the bitcoin himself, it's a big investment and besides, he continued, ""I've got other things I'd rather do.""  Asked what he thought about so-called privacy coins, Stallman said he'd gotten an expert to assess their potential, and ""for each one he would point out some serious problems, perhaps in its security or its scalability.""  And speaking broadly, Stallman continued:  ""If bitcoin protected privacy, I'd probably have found a way to use it by now.""  ...But not 'perfect' privacy  That pessimism aside, the GNU Project's Taler does share some aspects with cryptocurrency projects – most notably it aims to fill the same niche.  Start with Taler's intellectual lineage. It's based on blind signatures, a cryptographic technique invented by David Chaum, whose DigiCash was among the first attempts at creating secure electronic money. Plus, Taler's attempt to create a digital money that resists surveillance by governments and payments companies aligns it with many cryptocurrency projects.  Yet, Taler does not attempt to bypass centralized authority.  Payments are processed by openly centralized ""exchanges"" rather than peer-to-peer networks of miners because, Grothoff said, such a system ""would again enable dangerous, money laundering kind of practice.""  Indeed, in a break with the anti-government ethos that has tended to characterize bitcoin and some of its peers, Taler's design explicitly tries to block opportunities for tax evasion.  Speaking to this, Stallman told CoinDesk, ""We need a state to do many vital jobs, including fund research, fund education, provide people with medical care – provide everyone with medical care – build roads, maintain order, provide justice, including to those who are not rich and powerful, and so the state's got to bring in a lot of money.""  What a break from the political leanings of many of bitcoin's first adherents.  Stallman continued:  ""I wouldn't want perfect privacy because that would mean it would be impossible to investigate crimes at all. And that's one of the jobs we need the state to do.""  Privacy in the Taler system, then, is limited to users spending their digital cash. They are shielded from surveillance because, Grothoff said, ""the exchange, when coins are being redeemed, cannot tell if it was customer A or customer B or customer C who received the coin, because they all look identical from the exchange.""  ""Nobody,"" he added, ""exactly knows who has how many tokens.""  Merchants (or anyone) receiving payments, on the other hand, do so visibly and in the open, making it possible for governments to assess taxes on their income – not to mention harder for the recipients to participate in money laundering.  A place for crypto?  While Taler is not a cryptocurrency and doesn't have a native asset (there are no talers or TalerCoins), as a new payment rail for existing assets, the system could support cryptocurrency at some point.  Just as euros (the first currency that will be supported by the system), dollars and yen could all be sent using Taler, so could bitcoin.  Similarly, while Taler is not a blockchain, a blockchain-based system could take the place of a bank within the system.  For users to be able to move euros into the Taler wallet, though, Taler exchanges will need to interact with the traditional banking system to withdraw that money. In this same way, a blockchain-based system could work with Taler exchanges to allow users to get access to their cryptocurrency.  Grothoff compared the act of moving bank deposits to a Taler digital wallet to taking cash out of an ATM. Coins in the wallet are stored locally on a user's device, and if a user loses the key to their wallet, there's nothing that can be done to recover it, much like the crypto space's use of private/public key pairs.  Currently, Taler is in talks with European banks to allow withdrawal into the Taler wallet and also re-deposit from the Taler system back into the traditional banking system.  While the launch date on the project's website still lists 2018, Grothoff said, it's dependent of how quickly discussions with banks can be wrapped up. And he said, ""The banks are not necessarily easy or cheap to deal with.""  Although, nothing about the traditional banking system per se is essential to Taler's functioning (except perhaps for regulatory compliance). In principle, the ""register-based system"" that Taler plugs into could be a bank account or, in theory, a blockchain, said Grothoff.  If Taler gains traction, developers can experiment with different implementations and integrations – using banks or blockchains or whatever other register system they prefer. After all, Grothoff said:  ""It's free software.""

42402273,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3lt7,1543058421,The SEC's Recent Rulings Are More About Exchanges Than ICOs,"Noelle Acheson is a veteran of company analysis and member of CoinDesk’s product team.  The following article originally appeared in Institutional Crypto by CoinDesk, a newsletter for the institutional market, with news and views on crypto infrastructure delivered every Tuesday. Sign up here.      With the market reeling from the SEC’s settlement last week with two ICO issuers for not registering their tokens as securities, something significant has been overlooked.  Before we get to that, let’s briefly review what happened.  Last week the SEC reached settlements with AirFox and Paragon in its first cases brought purely for lack of registration, rather than for fraudulent activity. In characteristic overreaction, the market seemed to assume that ICOs were now “over.” This is far from true. What is “over” (finally!) is the vapid hype of token structures that don’t make sense, fund-raisings based on no business plan and ICOs that followed the “me too” model.  A new phase, a more realistic and constructive one, is just beginning.  Earlier this month, an SEC director revealed that the agency plans to release “plain English” guidance for when a token is and is not a security. Analysts have been poring over the subsequent official statement summarizing recent rulings for a sign of this. They haven’t found it.  Exchange fire  What seems to have been largely overlooked is that the statement also shines the spotlight on crypto exchanges. This is likely to have a much bigger impact on the sector in the short term.  Last week, the SEC announced a settlement with the founder of EtherDelta, a “decentralized exchange” for ethereum-based tokens, who had been accused of knowingly breaking securities laws by neither registering the platform with the SEC nor operating under an exemption. This was the SEC’s first enforcement action against a token exchange for failing to register.  In its statement, the SEC outlines what exactly is considered an “exchange,” and under what circumstances a token trading venue would be required to register – basically, in all circumstances in which tokens change hands on a platform.  Remember the report by the New York State Office of the Attorney General (OAG) on crypto exchanges from a couple of months ago? It gave a hint at what was to come: In the introduction it specifies “virtual asset trading platforms now in operation have not registered under state or federal securities or commodities laws.” Now, the SEC and the OAG are two very different regulators, with different remits and methods. But the objective is the same: to protect the investor.  The OAG’s report goes on to point out that digital asset platforms present an additional risk to the investor – token buyers and sellers can deal directly with them, whereas traditional exchanges operate with the public via the additional buffer of broker-dealers. In the crypto world, the platform is usually the trading venue and the broker-dealer. Even more reason, one can infer, for the regulators to focus their attention on the middlemen.  Fair exchange  An important detail is that the SEC has not yet prosecuted an exchange – EtherDelta was not the subject of the settlement, its founder was, and he sold the business in December of last year.  It will, therefore, be interesting to see what information comes to light in the first case brought against a trading platform for failure to register – and whether we will see crypto exchanges pre-empting the scrutiny by voluntarily doing so.  When this happens, we won’t be able to say we didn’t see it coming – and we should welcome the development.  While market attention seems to be focused on the ICO cull stemming from the now inevitable cost of security registration – and while it is a huge pity that so many investors will end up losing money on already-issued tokens that disappear as a result – its market impact is more dramatic than meaningful.  Exchange registration, on the other hand, will have a deeper impact on crypto assets going forward. It will bring upheaval in some business models, incur significant additional costs in compliance and paperwork, and perhaps trigger a sector concentration.  However, and more importantly, greater oversight over the middlemen will lead to the construction of a stronger infrastructure, that can work with regulators and institutions to bring increasing clarity and investment to the asset class.
