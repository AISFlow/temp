42426381,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJN67h,1433782848,MasterCard: Digital Currency’s Risks Outweigh the Benefits,"The risks presented by digital currencies far outweigh the benefits, MasterCard has claimed.  The global payment processor made these comments in its submission to the UK Treasury’s call for information on digital currencies last November.  According to the four-page submission, obtained by CoinDesk via a freedom of information request, MasterCard doesn’t believe digital currency has many, if any, strong benefits.  It attacks claims of digital currency’s low transaction costs, low payment processing time and strong system safety. The document reads:  ""We would argue that, when compared to MasterCard’s network, the claims pertaining to the speed and safety of digital currencies [do] not hold up, not least given that on average it takes 10 minutes for a block to be verified and that digital currencies are far more susceptible to hacking attacks.""  MasterCard goes on to say digital currency transaction costs may currently be lower than those involved in traditional payments methods, but this is because digital currency service providers don’t currently bear the cost of complying with consumer protection and anti-money laundering laws.  However, if regulation requiring this is introduced, the company says, the transaction costs will soon rise.  Consumer protection  MasterCard's submission suggests any new regulation the UK government creates should address the current lack of consumer protections in the digital currency space.  One of the risks it flags is that consumers currently have no form of official redress if they use digital currency to make a purchase and the merchant fails to deliver their goods.  To further highlight the safety of the existing financial system in comparison, the document references the UK’s Financial Services Compensation Scheme, which guarantees customers of registered companies up to £85,000 per person in compensation if the firm goes out of business.  The response makes numerous references to the high-profile failure of bitcoin exchange Mt Gox, highlighting how customers can suffer due to the lack of protections in the digital currency space.  MasterCard also believes bitcoin users are in danger as the cost of mining bitcoins will rise when usage of the currency increases, until the cost becomes unsustainable. It continues:  ""To achieve economies of scale, the higher marginal costs of digital currencies will lead to a reduction in the number of miners down to a monopoly miner, defeating the original design of digital currencies and opening them up to system-wide fraud.""  Final recommendations  MasterCard suggests the government should create regulation that addresses the risks associated with cryptocurrency while still enabling lawful digital currency businesses to ""flourish"".  The ""current blockchain process"" doesn’t provide sufficient transparency, it says, and regulation should require all transactions to go through regulated and transparent administrators, which would be supervised by relevant domestic, European or global authorities.  Digital currency companies should also be licensed and supervised in the same way non-bank money transmitters are. They should be required to ""perform Know Your Customer checks, maintain an AML program, file suspicious activity reports and address cybersecurity vulnerabilities"".  Finally, MasterCard believes the government should develop consumer protections which would force digital currency companies to create a formal consumer complaint process and enable the reversal of unauthorised charges.  Other submissions  Other companies to submit responses to the call for information include Accenture and Citi.  Accenture suggested  in its response that the UK government should consider regulating bitcoin wallets, applying the same identification requirements as it does to bank accounts.  Citi’s Treasury and Trade Services Technology and Innovation Team, on the other hand, suggested the Treasury should think about creating its own digital currency.

42426383,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJN69h,1433779085,LHV Bank Develops Wallet App Built on Bitcoin’s Blockchain,"Estonia’s LHV Bank has backed a project to create a financial services platform and money-transfer app that will utilize bitcoin to facilitate transactions.  The Cuber Wallet app, which is available on both Android and Apple devices, enables users to send and receive euros instantly and free of charge. The experimental system uses the bitcoin blockchain by way of colored coins, according to the bank.  LHV Bank has also announced the creation of an experimental type of digital security. The development of the bitcoin-based certificate of deposit mirrors work conducted in other parts of the world by other institutions like Nasdaq OMX Group Inc that are keen on experimenting with bitcoin.  Swedish company ChromaWay AB, which focuses on colored coin technology, assisted with the creation of the Cuber platform. Developers from a variety of nations worked on the project, including those from Estonia, Ukraine, Sweden, Israel and Russia.  Rain Lõhmus, CEO of Cuber Technology, a subsidiary of LHV Group, said in a statement:  “We hope Cuber can ... liberate innovation from organizational borders, truly decentralize it. And true innovation in [the] financial sector will flourish.”  Work on the project began last year, as indicated during an interview with LHV head of retail banking Andres Kitter. At the time, Kitter told CoinDesk the bank saw the initiative as a way to ""explore what could be built on top of the underlying technology"".  The money transfer app is currently undergoing testing and is free for download, but currently comes with deposit restrictions. LHV is planning to undertake beta tests of the app sometime this fall.

42426386,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJN6Lh,1433774357,Survey: Silk Road Closure Didn't Stop Dark Web Drug Surge,"Drug sales on the dark web actually increased after the closure of bitcoin-only marketplace Silk Road, a new survey has shown.  Established by addiction specialist Dr Adam Winstock in 2011, the Global Drug Survey is a harm reduction initiative that seeks to provide accurate statistics on substance use worldwide.  Analysing over 100,000 responses from 50 countries, the survey found the number of users buying drugs from dark marketplaces rose by 1.2% in 2014.  The UK led this surge in demand, with 15.1% of British drug users buying from the dark web, a near-3% rise from the year before.  Benefits and risks  Users said they were mainly attracted by the anonymity, reduced violence, better quality and cheaper drugs afforded by sites on the dark web.  Despite the apparent benefits of buying drugs on the dark web, the survey respondents also noted the risks of purchasing online, with data showing that buyers were mainly concerned with losing money and not receiving their orders.  Dark web marketplaces have been known to vanish with people's funds in the past. In March, online drug market Evolution disappeared amid allegations that its administrators had absconded with more than $12m-worth of bitcoin.  The publication of the survey comes after Ross Ulbricht, the convicted founder of drug bazaar Silk Road was sentenced to life in prison on narcotics and computer hacking charges.  During sentencing, US District Judge Katherine Forrest dismissed the notion that the marketplace reduced harm, adding that much drug violence happens ""upstream"" of users.  ""Poppies for heroin come from Mexico or Afghanistan ... when Silk Road expands the market, it is expanding the demand,"" she added.  A small set of respondents (4%) in the Global Drug Survey said they did not consume drugs prior to accessing them through dark web markets, while 30% said they had consumed a wider range of drugs since using sites on the deep web.  By contrast, 45% of people said their drug consumption had remained unaltered – with MDMA, LSD, cannabis and cocaine still the most popular substances.

42421069,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXWBXZ,1433761653,My Life Inside a Remote Chinese Bitcoin Mine,"Eric Mu is chief marketing officer at HaoBTC, a bitcoin wallet service. Here he speaks about life at the company's bitcoin mine in the Tibetan mountains.  Living three months in a place where you have to travel 10km to reach the closest store might be inconceivable for a modern city dweller. For me however, being face-to-face with nature, plus the chance to witness some sort of modern alchemy, holds irresistible appeal.  When the chance came, I didn’t hesitate. A four-hour flight and eight-hour drive later, long after I lost count of the tunnels and bridges I passed, I arrived in HaoBTC’s multi-petahash bitcoin farm, nestled in the mountains.  The view wouldn't look out of place in a James Bond movie. The only link to the outside world is a road 150 meters away. When a mild earthquake struck the region last year, this link was severed and the workers of the nearby power station ate potatoes for weeks before deliverance arrived.  The native population is Tibetan, and Yi villagers live in relatively primitive conditions by the prevailing standard. When the government offered millions of yuan each to evict a nearby village to build a dam, the story goes that the villagers, who probably had no notion of a number that large, refused categorically.  But money is coming, in a way many wouldn’t expect.  The mine  People have been puzzled by the fast growth of bitcoin mining in China. However, one big reason it has ramped up so dramatically is the buildout of hydropower in the west of the country.  The first petahash mining farms were built in Shanxi and Inner Mongolia where coal was cheap and plentiful, but even cheap coal can’t compete with free water.  Now, the farms are migrating en masse towards the west. Our local power station, with a capacity of 25,000 kW, started generating power in 2013, but when HaoBTC's CEO Wu Gang came across it last year, the company was having difficulty paying its employees.  It couldn't obtain the quota enabling them sell power to national grid, which prefers the state-owned power stations over those that are privately-owned. Also, the county-level grid could only consume a small percentage of the power the station generated.  When Wu Gang appeared on the scene with a wacky idea to mine bitcoin using hydropower, people were initially skeptical. However, once they overcame this initial bout of confusion it was clear a win-win arrangement could be formed.  Prior to the discovery of the new power supply, Wu Gang already owned mining operations in two locations, producing 7 PH/s. Once preparation at the local hydropower station was completed, Wu Gang’s miners quickly relocated to take advantage of the cheap power.  Two buildings have now been constructed to house the miners and two more are currently underway.  The farm operates over 10,000 Antminer S3 units, which, alongside the huge ventilation fans, generate a drone that is more than a little annoying. Not what I would call deafening, but you have to be loud when you talk to someone even close to you – an ideal environment to teach you to be economical with words.  As for the temperature, it is often around 35 degrees Celsius, but it doesn't feel that hot because of the wind.  The employees  Of the seven people employed at the farm, most are in their early twenties and have been in the business for one to two years.  The 6,000 yuan ($967) monthly salary might not be much for a white collar employee in Beijing, but for the village kids who have no advanced degree or special professional skills, this is good money.  By comparison, a 40-year-old employee at the local hydropower station told me he got paid slightly more than 3,000 ($484) yuan per month.  Money is certainly a big factor in making life in an isolated environment more bearable, especially when 1,500 yuan extra is added for their sacrifice of weekends.  Once the two remaining buildings have been constructed, the mine workers will be able to have one month of vacation for every two months of work, though some might miss the 1,500 yuan subsidy.  All the staff in the company’s Beijing office, most of whom are programmers, get paid in BTC, but workers here still prefer fiat – the idea of a bitcoin salary is easier to pitch to programmers.  The day-to-day  My first week working at the farm involved more menial labor than I expected. I consider myself reasonably fit, yet after moving hundreds of miners off the truck and onto the shelves, I was depressed by my sore arms the next day. By contrast, my colleagues were in good spirits and maintained their high efficiency.  My coworkers are from Hunan and Sichuan and their accents make communication slightly hard – I still have trouble understanding them when they talk among themselves, but they always make an effort to speak in mandarin when speaking to me.  After various conversations at the facility, I soon realized they are knowledgeable about bitcoin. However, not so much about the latest news or theoretical debate, but the legendary figures who made their names and fortunes by investing early.  Wu Gang is one such legend and, needless to say, their hero. This is especially true for those from his hometown in Hunan.  Routine at the mine is simple. At 07:50am we have a morning meeting. All who fail to attend on time get a small penalty.  Everyone is required to explain what they did the previous day and what they plan to do that day. All problems are reported and solutions are proposed and at the end of each meeting, the manager, Mr Guo, assigns tasks and gives a pep talk.  The staff then splits off into two teams, each of which has a leader who has more responsibility and a slightly bigger paycheque.  One such employee, Mr Guo, is a mild, soft-spoken man from Hunan. Before being involved in bitcoin, he ran a small camera repair shop in Changsha, the capital city of Hunan province.  One day, he was contacted by his old schoolmate Wu Gang, who he hadn’t seen for years. Guo was asked if he was interested in managing his bitcoin mine. With no prior experience and no idea what bitcoin was, Guo took the challenge. Two and half years on, Guo has managed three farms and become an expert on the cryptocurrency.  Downtime  There aren’t many recreational activities to speak of at the mine. Spare time is whiled away with copious amounts of cigarettes, the occasional beer, TV, smart phones and good old poker games.  Chewing dried betel quid is also common – I was told it works as a form of stimulant and is slightly addictive. I tried it once, it tasted like mint-flavored chewing gum.  While the surroundings are beautiful, there’s not much to do outside the mine. Some coworkers told me they have been here for three months and the farthest they have ventured is a small town some 20km away. Their verdict was: ""Absolutely nothing to see. The local Tibetans make sure everything is overpriced.""  Bitcoin believers  Bitcoin is famously volatile but that is perhaps one of the reasons we love it – the unpredictability. For someone to invest millions of dollars in a mining farm, you have to have a strong faith in the technology.  Wu made it rule number one that everyone joining this company must be a believer in bitcoin. But it is also a business, so the farm will probably only last as long as it is profitable.  The electrical rate right now is low and the team’s dedication and expertise adds to our competitiveness. But we are not blind to risk – profitability may become unattainable someday, we may have to sell our equipment to those who can still make profit. Until then, the machines whir on.
