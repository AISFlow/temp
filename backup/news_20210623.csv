42387154,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBlkfJ,1624488152,'I Regret Nothing': McAfee's Wild Ride From Infosec Exec to Crypto Bad Boy,"John McAfee, software pioneer, ex-presidential candidate, cryptocurrency entrepreneur and paid advocate, lived a storied life.      He was known as much for his drugs, women and gun-filled escapades as the security software that bears his name and made him rich. Although McAfee was a pivotal figure in the history of computing, his stature within crypto was tarnished by failed projects, broken promises and associations with alleged scams.      Still, he was an icon of sorts, with well over 1 million Twitter followers by the time he was found dead Wednesday in a Spanish prison. A man born against the state, he led authorities on a manhunt in the years prior to being detained by Spanish police in 2020. It was on the high seas – in uncontrolled waters – that McAfee ran most of his campaign for U.S. president, a race he entered in 2018 to “best serve the cryptocurrency community.” It was McAfee's second presidential run.      Signs point to a suicide, according to Spain’s justice department. Hours before his body was found, the Spanish High Court ruled McAfee could be extradited to the U.S. to face tax evasion charges, in part, related to schemes involving cryptocurrencies.    Read more: McAfee Found Dead in Spanish Prison as Extradition Loomed; Autopsy Planned    McAfee was wanted in Tennessee and New York for tax-related criminal charges and alleged failure to disclose income made from cryptocurrency. He was also charged with not disclosing earnings made from speaking engagements and the sale of his story for an upcoming documentary between 2014-2018. In March, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accused him of hiding cryptocurrency income of more than $23 million. He faced a prison sentence of up to 30 years.      “The U.S. believes I have hidden crypto,” McAfee, 75, wrote in a pinned tweet, one of his last, on June 16. “I wish I did but it has dissolved through the many hands of Team McAfee (your belief is not required), and my remaining assets are all seized. My friends evaporated through fear of association.      “I have nothing.      “Yet, I regret nothing,”    From the C-Suite to the High Seas    McAfee, who was born in the U.K. and raised in Virginia, released the first commercial anti-virus software – McAfee VirusScan. Although he sold McAfee Associates, founded in 1987, to Intel, it was an association he couldn’t break. In 2013, he published a video titled, “How to Uninstall McAfee Antivirus,” which featured a bleary-eyed McAfee shooting his own computer.      That same year he told USA Today he was “just tired of technology.” In a career arc that spanned decades and moved from software to antibiotics to anti-surveillance technology, McAfee eventually found renewed purpose in decentralized technologies. It was an industry he’d stake his genitals on.      In 2012, he fled Belize as police said he was a “person of interest” in the murder of Gregory Viant Faull, an American expat. He surfaced in Guatemala, where he was detained by authorities. After that he went to Seattle by way of Miami, where he lived an uncharacteristically low-profile life until running for president in 2016 as a Libertarian.      In 2014, McAfee founded Future Tense, a startup dedicated to building a decentralized networking tool called D-Central. It was essentially a way to access and support mesh networks to send messages and files anonymously without touching the web.      Two years later he joined MGT Capital Investments, where he pivoted the firm’s focus on sports and gaming sites to cryptocurrency mining, as chief executive. After an amicable split, McAfee joined the enterprise blockchain startup Luxcore in 2018.      At the height of the initial coin offering (ICO) boom, McAfee acted as a paid promoter for a number of companies and projects. He reportedly charged more than $100,000 for a single promotional tweet to his many followers. In one memorable stunt from 2018, he had a promotional “Skycoin” tattoo inked on his back.    Read more: Where in the World Is John McAfee?    It was a lucrative activity that McAfee ended after claiming to receive “threats” from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In the years since, there has been some reporting detailing his alleged association with various pump and dumps.      In June 2019, McAfee unveiled the Magic trading platform and announced he would launch his own cryptocurrency, Freedom Coin. A month later, from an undisclosed location on his boat, McAfee tweeted: “I Am a presidential candidate with 1.2 mil followers. My crime is not filing tax returns – not a crime. The rest is propaganda by the U.S. government to silence me. My voice is the voice of dissent. If I am silenced, dissent itself will be next.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TOKEN SALE,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/06/23/i-regret-nothing-mcafees-wild-ride-from-infosec-exec-to-crypto-bad-boy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4470c8b97ca707e9390d55213d306014890b6531-1400x933.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The sale, however, prompted the Jack Ma-controlled Ant Group to clarify that non-fungible tokens are not cryptocurrencies, Reuters reported. Ant’s swift response appears to be related to China’s intensifying crackdowns on crypto trading and mining.      Alipay and Dunhuang Research Academy jointly released two images based on AntChain, which is Ant’s enterprise blockchain, for the app’s payment page. Each image has 8,000 copies.      The two digital artworks appear to be inspired by murals in the Mogao caves in Gansu province of Northwestern China, which has been listed as a world heritage site by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).      The buyers do not own the copyrights of these two images. But the image will appear on their payment pages whenever they use Alipay. People were able to purchase the digital artworks by a combination of 9.9 yuan (or $1.52) and 10 Alipay reward points, which can be earned by its users from making purchases with the mobile app.      NFT art can be auctioned on Alipay, and Ant Group’s enterprise blockchain AntChain said it supports NFT products with its technology, according to the report.      Alipay’s adoption of NFTs could be significant because it provides Chinese buyers with a channel to pay for NFT artwork with the local fiat currency, the renminbi. The artwork on decentralized public chains such as Ethereum would have to be paid with native tokens. That could be difficult for Chinese investors since the country started cracking down on fiat-to-crypto trading in 2017.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | TRADING,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/06/23/ant-group-says-nfts-are-not-cryptocurrencies-after-digital-artwork-sells-out,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/919dd33069209e299bb4fed3ec338caf16298f93-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Senior officials for Hamas, which the U.S. government has designated as a terrorist organization and which controls the Gaza Strip, recently told The Wall Street Journal the organization has experienced a swelling in the amount of cryptocurrency donations since the beginning of an armed conflict with Israel in May.      Blockchain analytics firm Elliptic confirmed the trend in crypto donations to designated terrorist organizations in a blog post published in June. Elliptic reported the military wing of Hamas, the Al-Qassam Brigades, had received over $100,000 in bitcoin donations since 2019, $73,000 of which was donated after the start of the armed conflict in May.      Cryptocurrency donations circumvent existing sanctions measures, said the bill’s sponsor, Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.), in his press release announcing the bill. The Hamas International Financing Prevention Act is an attempt to update and expand existing legislation which already sanctions individuals and entities providing financial support to Hamas.      The legislation has 51 bipartisan co-sponsors.

42387161,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBlkmr,1624479314,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Nudges Up as Regulatory Risks Linger,"Cryptocurrencies were slightly higher on Wednesday as traders grappled with the likelihood of more regulation. Bitcoin is up about 1.9% over the past 24 hours, giving up about half of Tuesday’s relief rally, suggesting that buyers are starting to take profits.      “It's too early to tell if this is 'the' bottom or just a temporary floor before more downside. The lack of any upside catalyst (beside some contrarian oversold metrics) remains the biggest hurdle for cryptos to bounce back,” Elie Le Rest, partner and co-founder of crypto hedge fund ExoAlpha, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.    Latest prices    Cryptocurrencies:    Bitcoin (BTC) $33083.9, +1.52%  Ether (ETH) $1923.6, +0.97%    Traditional markets:    S&P 500: 4241, -0.11%  Gold: $1773.9, -0.27%  10-year Treasury yielded 1.489% versus 1.475% on Tuesday    “Overall we might witness a range market in July with lower tranches $25,000-$35,000,” Le Rest wrote.      Delta Exchange CEO Pankaj Balani doesn't expect bitcoin to break $30,000 support. “Naked shorts have started to enter the market and the risk of sharp rises due to short squeezes is higher,” he wrote in an email.      The risk of further regulatory pressure still looms, however.      “Private unbacked cryptocurrencies like bitcoin may be hogging the spotlight, but the role of regulators and policymakers as key gatekeepers likely limits their potential to catalyze truly transformational change,” JPMorgan wrote in a research note published on Monday.      From a macro perspective, bitcoin’s sell-off has coincided with a broader move away from risky assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies over the past two months, as shown by the decline in the copper/gold ratio. Support at $30,000 is critical for bitcoin, although resistance is strong at $40,000.    Reach for yield    Aside from the slight ""risk-off"" tone over the past few months, the recent decline in negative-yielding debt could be an obstacle for cryptocurrencies.      The downtrend in global interest rates has encouraged a search for yield as central banks remain committed to accommodative monetary policies. Those easy money policies have benefitted risk assets such as corporate bonds, emerging market debt and more recently cryptocurrencies.      “Any evidence that easy money is ending with a more hawkish stance by central banks will likely be a drag for speculative assets,” Santiago Espinosa, a strategist at MRB Partners, wrote in an email.    Bitcoin dominance stabilizes    Bitcoin’s dominance rate, or the top cryptocurrency’s share of the total crypto market, dropped to under 40% in May, which preceded a near 30% price crash. Since then, the dominance rate has stabilized, suggesting that bitcoin is regaining its luster.      “The surge of new altcoins diverted some capital away from BTC and spread it out across small-cap assets, many of which later died out,” Coin Metrics wrote in a newsletter published on Tuesday.      The chart below shows a proxy of BTC dominance against roughly 100 of the largest altcoins, using the free float version of market capitalization, according to Coin Metrics.    Ether options trade gone bad    An ether put options seller lost $3 million by taking a large bet against a sharp drop in the cryptocurrency and ended up booking a massive loss on Tuesday.      The trader likely sold the $2,560 puts during the bull run, expecting a continued rally to last at least until the end of the year and thus a steady drop in the option’s price. However, ether peaked above $4,000 on May 12 and fell to $1,700 on Tuesday.      “The market moved just enough to force the trader to take a loss by buying back 5,000 contracts of the December expiry $2,560 put option sold earlier this quarter,” Greg Magadini, CEO of options analytics platform Genesis Volatility, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.      The loss underscores that selling options, be it a put or a call, is a strategy better suited to institutions with ample capital supply and high-risk tolerance.    Altcoin roundup  Privacy coin monero has increasingly become a tool for criminals such as ransomware gangs to demand money from victims, according to a Financial Times article. The cryptocurrency, which was designed to veil senders, receivers and the amount for each transaction, saw its price rise 15% on Wednesday. The cryptocurrency has a market cap of $3.8 billion.  “The features monero offers probably land itself for criminals to protect their activities, but ten years ago you read the same thing about bitcoin,” Vik Sharma, CEO of Cake Wallet, told First Mover. “It is a double-edged sword. But again, so is cash. So is bitcoin.”  On Tuesday, Polkadot, the token for the smart contract blockchain of the same name, rose by more than 70% in just four hours on U.S.-based crypto exchange Coinbase. However, the price on other exchanges followed the larger market sell-off. A Coinbase spokesperson told CoinDesk the exchange was investigating what happened, and said the price discrepancy of DOT (-1.56%) between Coinbase and other major exchanges was likely due to the “send and receive” function being disabled as part of “the incident.”  Relevant news  Goldman Sachs Taps JPMorgan’s Private Blockchain for Repo Trade: Report  Bipartisan Crypto Bills Pass US House of Representatives – Again  3iQ’s Bitcoin ETF Rises on First Day of Trading on Nasdaq Dubai  Other Markets    All but one digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 ended up in green on Wednesday.

42387139,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBlkRT,1624477319,McAfee Found Dead in Spanish Prison as Extradition Loomed; Autopsy Planned,"John McAfee, the controversial software magnate and crypto booster, has died in what's preliminarily being called a suicide in a prison in Barcelona. El Pais was first to report the news.      Prison sources tell CoinDesk an autopsy is being planned.      McAfee was awaiting extradition to the U.S. to stand trial on charges of tax fraud, which the Spanish High Court authorized just this morning.      “Everything indicates that it could be a death by suicide,” the Catalan Department of Justice said in a statement.      When reached by phone by CoinDesk, a prison staffer said: ""For information about John McAfee, you may call tomorrow at 9 a.m. local time.""      According to an October 2020 indictment by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), “McAfee earned millions in income from promoting cryptocurrencies, consulting work, speaking engagements, and selling the rights to his life story for a documentary.”      During an extradition hearing earlier this month, McAfee claimed that the extradition efforts were politically motivated.      He faced a total of 10 years in prison for allegedly cheating his way out of $4 million.      McAfee was arrested in October 2020 at Barcelona's El Prat airport as he prepared to board a flight to Turkey, according to El País.      In a November 2020 interview with Spanish journal El Diario, McAfee said, “Life in Spanish prisons is like living in a Hilton compared to the surreal submissive and dehumanizing conditions of American prisons.”      McAfee was a controversial figure in the later years of his life, participating in alleged “pump and dump” schemes as well as being paid to promote a number of initial coin offerings, without disclosing those payments.      The DOJ declined to comment. In an email, the agency referred CoinDesk to the Spanish authorities.      Nikhilesh De and Andrés Engler contributed reporting.

42387162,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBlklb,1624477157,Why the Current Inflation Wave Could Fizzle Out,"Fed Chair Jerome Powell yesterday admitted to Congress that inflation effects in the U.S. economy “have been larger than we expected, and they may turn out to be more persistent than we have expected.” The U.S. Consumer Price Index rose 5% year-over-year in May, the highest level in 13 years. Inflation excluding food and energy was at 3.8%, the highest level for that number in 30 years.      That’s all worrying, and inflation has rightly been a focus of discussion as the pandemic ends and stimulus checks keep going out. Continued 5% inflation or higher would be, among other things, a vindication of the anti-Fed, hard-money thesis that fuels many Bitcoiners, and a real chance to test whether the digital currency is an anti-inflationary hedge.    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    But Powell didn’t sound any major alarms on Tuesday, holding to the line that inflation effects in the economy were largely transitory, the product of post-pandemic reopening demand. Powell cited pandemic demand for airline tickets, for instance, as everyone gets vaccinated and decides to travel at the same time.      He might also have cited the price of rental cars, or used vehicles, or graphics cards, or Uber rides, or housing-grade lumber. There are certainly other examples, but these may be the most representative of what you could roughly call supply-driven inflation. In short, rising overall prices in the U.S. have been substantially driven, not by a surplus of money above pre-pandemic levels, but in many cases by supplies of goods and services that are below pre-pandemic levels.      Here’s a picture I took of a used car lot in Texas recently.      Your mental model for inflation may be someone taking a wheelbarrow full of money to the grocery store to buy a loaf of bread, but maybe add this image, too – a near-empty used car lot in a nation full of people going absolutely insane with the desire to move.      The complexity of the used-car story is representative of the broader supply-constraint story. Used car prices are surging because many car manufacturers cancelled their orders for crucial chips in early 2020, betting the pandemic meant car sales would crater long-term. They were incredibly wrong, but by the time they decided they needed more chips, fabricators had taken on other, more valuable clients. So now, the OEMs can’t make as many new cars, and people are turning to used vehicles en masse.      The chips that displaced those automaker contracts probably sometimes included graphics cards, or GPUs, which have also surged in price for reasons unrelated to what we consider “inflation.” The skyrocketing price of Ethereum in particular during the pandemic juiced GPU demand from miners, leaving gamers absolutely forlorn. The prices of computer peripherals like GPUs are part of the CPI calculation (though CPI measures retail prices, not the huge markups for GPUs on eBay in recent months).      The other stories are similar. Lumber prices went bananas in April and May because the people wanted new houses at rates well above pre-pandemic levels. Recent months have seen more new housing starts than at any time since roughly 2005.      Some of this demand is enabled by pandemic relief, of course. But even that doesn’t make it inflation as commonly understood. The key issue here, as Nobel-prize winning progressive economist Paul Krugman laid out yesterday, is the difference between transitory inflation and core inflation. And many of the current big inflation drivers have clear solutions that don’t involve constraining the money supply.      Partly, we’re already seeing a dropoff in demand as those who needed their houses/plane tickets/new cars YESTERDAY get their needs met. Lumber is already cratering, down 5% today as I write this. Growth in used vehicle prices has slowed to about 0.6% per month so far in June, down from rollicking 4.65% month-over-month growth in May. That’s extremely significant because used car prices made up a large portion of the May inflation numbers, and they look like they’ll be effectively gone for June CPI calculations.      But other solutions will be on the supply side, as disrupted supply chains reconstitute themselves to meet demand. Carmakers will eventually get their chip suppliers back (especially if Ethereum keeps dumping), and those used-car lots will fill up again. Spread across sectors, that would mean the last few months weren’t about long-term inflation, but short-term recovery, as dollars chase scarce goods and motivate producers to make more goods. Inflation happens when a growing supply of money hits a fixed supply of products. It seems pretty clear that’s not what we’re dealing with here when it comes to manufactured goods.      (The story is significantly different and more complicated when it comes to labor and wages, and I’ll point you to Joe Wiesenthal for a deeper dive on that side).      We’ll have a pretty definitive answer to these questions within the next couple of weeks; June inflation data will be trickling in until we get updated CPI in the second week of July. My bet is that as the economy smooths out its last few pandemic wrinkles, inflation will retreat, if not to near-zero prepandemic levels, at least to the 2% to 3% that the Fed, and most economists, consider manageable.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,David Z.

42387157,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBlkhp,1624476428,Huobi’s Tighter Derivatives Rules Leave Chinese Traders Scrambling for Alternatives,"Some Chinese traders and investors are seeking other trading venues after crypto exchange giant Huobi ramped up derivatives restrictions amid China’s crypto crackdown.      “Due to recent dynamic changes in the market, in order to protect the interests of investors, a portion of services such as futures contracts, ETP [exchange-traded products] or other leveraged investment products are temporarily unavailable to new users from a few specified countries and regions,” Huobi wrote in a statement sent to CoinDesk.      The exchange also confirmed that certain restrictions on futures leverage levels were set “in a few specific countries and regions.”      Huobi didn't specify which countries or regions are affected, but according to China-based crypto journalist Colin Wu, the new restrictions specifically target users in China because of the renewed regulatory crackdown in the country.      “The regulators in China have been pointing out that maybe these offshore exchanges offer a lot of leverages...maybe they should not do as much,” Su Zhu, CEO and co-founder of Singapore-based crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, said in his podcast Uncommon Core last Thursday.      Huobi is one of the so-called “Big Three” crypto exchanges popular among Chinese traders and investors; the other two are Binance and OKEx. Huobi’s decision was probably not taken lightly as derivatives are among the key products defining the competition between the three exchanges in the Chinese market.      According to data provider Skew, Binance is now the No. 1 cryptocurrency exchange by bitcoin futures open interest, followed by OKEx. Huobi ranks at No. 6.      The escalation in restrictions has left many long-time Chinese crypto traders scrambling. Many bitcoin miners have been shutting down their operations in China in recent weeks (though without moving out of the country physically), and now traders and investors suddenly feel compelled to find alternatives to Huobi.      Even though the country banned fiat-to-crypto trading in 2017, Chinese traders and investors have been key parts of the crypto market in the same way China’s miners have had tremendous power in bitcoin mining. A report by blockchain data firm Chainanalysis shows that between June 2019 and July 2020, more than 30% of global crypto trading took place in East Asia, a huge chunk of which is dominated by China.    Binance gains appeal    To some, the obvious alternative to Huobi is Binance.      They are going to “either Binance or smaller China-based exchanges,” Wu told CoinDesk.      OKEx is out of the questoin for many, Wu said, especially for long-time crypto traders in China. That’s because in October, the exchange announced an unexpected five-week-long suspension of the crypto withdrawal service on its platform, saying one of its key holders had “been out of touch” with the exchange since he was “cooperating with a public security bureau in investigations.”      According to several sources who only agreed to speak anonymously on the subject, Binance is more appealing to Chinese traders in part because the company has moved most of its operations and staff outside China since the country's crackdown on crypto exchanges in 2017.      Binance’s CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao previously said that his company does not have headquarters.    Move to DEXs?    Others argue that China’s doubling down on crypto trading ban is creating an opportunity for decentralized exchanges (DEXs).      Three Arrows’ Zhu said in his podcast that people will start to recognize the advantages of using DEXs over centralized exchanges (CEXs), with an example of crypto exchange FTX’s support for Solana-based DEX Serum.      Rachel Lin, CEO of SynFutures, a new decentralized derivatives exchange, told CoinDesk that she has seen more people in China start to become familiar with DEXs, if they aren't using one already.      Incidents such as what happened to OKEx in October are unlikely to happen on DEXs, according to Lin, because DEXs are smart contracts running on blockchains such as Ethereum.      “Even if the whole team of the DEX project is gone, the code is still there” on the smart contract, she said.      Not everyone agrees that DEXs will be seen as a viable alternative for most traders any time soon. Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of derivatives exchange FTX, told CoinDesk through a spokesperson that his company is not seeing a move to DEXs.      “I think DEXs have huge upside, but I'd be surprised if they replaced CEXs,” he said. “The products have a long way to go before they’re competitive.”      Most sources who spoke with CoinDesk said that it is too premature to conclude that Chinese investors will flock to DEXs in the near future because the crypto trading crackdown in China affects both centralized and decentralized exchanges, with tightened over-the-counter (OTC) channels for traders to exchange Chinese yuan for bitcoin or U.S. dollar-based stablecoin, tether.      “DEXs still need OTC markets to settle fiat deposits and withdrawals,” Alex Lee, head of development at layer-2 DEX ZKSwap, said via a representative.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | BNB,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/06/23/huobis-tighter-derivatives-rules-leave-chinese-traders-scrambling-for-alternatives,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8b03fe4023444c6b18005c331f44f8e9693779cd-690x525.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42387166,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBlkj5,1624474960,Understanding the Meme Stock Barbarians at Wall Street's Gates,"GameStop has become much more than a video game retailer. When a tribe of Reddit-organized traders pumped up its stock earlier this year, the long-floundering brick-and-mortar outlet became, probably forever, a synecdoche for the broader transformation of investment markets by zero-fee trading, social media and pandemic relief payments.      The drama of the story hinged largely on GameStop’s dark-horse status: As a physical retailer of digital products (video game software), the company seemed inevitably bound for the glue factory of capitalism. That had led a huge number of professional investors to bet against it. The destruction of those shorts when small-time traders banded together behind the stock gave proceedings a crucial sheen of David-vs-Goliath virtue.    David Z. Morris is CoinDesk's chief insights columnist.    We don’t yet have a clear vision of what $GME and other so-called “meme stocks” (as well as “meme coins”) mean for the investing landscape, but a new podcast miniseries from The Wall Street Journal makes a strong first attempt. ""To The Moon"" just published the last of its five episodes (you can also find the miniseries in TheJournal’s daily podcast feed). Host Annie Minoff talked to more than two dozen meme-stock traders, and dove into some crucial history, to unpack the antics of RoaringKitty and company.      Minoff and I spoke last week about the project, and what she thinks meme trading will really lead to. What she found upends some common assumptions about the WallStreetBets crowd.      I was most surprised by Minoff’s verdict on the kinds of people behind the GameStop phenomenon: She thinks they’re more responsible and rational than most finance professionals assume. The WallStreetBets crowd is largely defined by their love of what’s known as YOLO trades – big, longshot bets with life-changing potential, but irresponsible amounts of downside risk.    Read more: Opinion: How Regulating GameStop’s ‘Market Manipulation’ Could Harm Crypto    I’ve always assumed the rise of YOLO trades were a product of America’s increasingly long-shot economy, in which various forms of gambling can sometimes seem like the only chance to get ahead. But Minoff instead found people who were making calculated, rather than desperate, bets.      “I can’t tell you how many people have said to me, ‘I’m young. If I’m going to take a risk, I’m going to take it now. I’m in, maybe, my mid-20s, I see the prospect of a nine-to-five job in my future.”      That’s hardly the bleak dichotomy between wealth and destitution that I’d associated with the $GME hordes. Instead, most of the traders Minoff talked to were young and had money to spare. “I can’t recall off the top of my head a desperation YOLO,” she says.      “A lot of them tell me, I wouldn’t be doing this if I was older or had a family. There was a sense of, ‘this is money that I can afford to lose.’”      But the larger historical forces traced by the show are even more interesting. Most importantly, Minoff rewinds to tell the story of Jack Bogle, who in the 1970s championed low-fee index funds and passive long-term investing, making equity accumulation vastly more accessible to the masses.      Minoff draws a clear line from Bogle to Robinhood, which pioneered the expansion of low- or no-fee trading from slow-moving index investing to active stock trading. It remains to be seen whether their legacies will align, of course, because active day trading is generally a really good way to lose money. At the very least, both impulses seem democratic – even if one is mostly giving you the freedom to lose money.      Technology enabled Robinhood’s no-fee trading, but the rise of social media was probably even more important. Much the same way unions allow many people to organize for their interests against a single entity with vast wealth, trading coalitions organized through Reddit or Twitter allow small fry to act like big fish: The “short squeeze” at the heart of Reddit’s $GME win is a perfect example. Those coalitions will almost certainly become more organized and sophisticated over time.      That technology and organization, though, might not have mattered if it wasn’t for widespread resentment about economic inequality – though what Minoff found again subverts easy assumptions. There was a big divide, she says, between those buying $GME based on a clear thesis in late-2020, and those who bought in after the media got hold of the story.      “When you talk to people who jumped in closer to the big surge in January, it’s not just an opportunity to make some money, it’s an opportunity to make some money off of Wall Street’s losses,” Minoff says.      This is somewhat worrying, of course. Like any emotion-driven and fact-lite investment pattern, the “stick it to the man” trade seems ripe for manipulation. And as we’ve seen in Elon Musk’s cruel dalliance with dogecoin, there are plenty of Pied Pipers eager to lead small traders off a cliff.    Read more: Money Reimagined: Memes Mean Money    But the biggest risks of social trading are likely to hedge funds and other large institutional investors. Those entities generally have complex models based on long-run trends and data that simply don’t, and likely can’t, account for the whims of the WallStreetBets mob.      Obviously, people have been trading stock tips for centuries, but the speed and openness of digital social media qualifies, I think, as a radical break – this is something entirely new under the sun. The current default models simply don’t incorporate the possibility for fast, coordinated moves, especially moves not really based on fundamentals. It’s true that hedge funds have big advantages over even well-coordinated amateurs. But there will be a lot more Melvin Capitals getting wrecked before funds really figure out their angle.      Institutions certainly need to come up with some sort of game plan. Because Minoff, who still keeps an eye on the WallStreetBets board, doesn’t think the phenomenon is going anywhere.      “They were there before RoaringKitty, and they’re there now … It’s GameStop, it’s AMC. But there are new names every week.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | DOGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,David Z.

42434600,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPpbTh,1624470283,DeFi Is the Next Frontier of High-Frequency Trading,"High frequency trading (HFT) is one of the most mystical and often misunderstood elements of capital markets. Brought to popular culture with Michael Lewis’ book “Flash Boys,” HFT is synonymous with speed, technological innovation and secrecy.      HFT quant funds remain among the most opaque entities in the trading ecosystem. Part of the obscurity surrounding HFT firms is dictated by the heavy competition in the space, the short lifespan of alpha opportunities and that HFT looks to take advantage of short-term market inefficiencies that can be rapidly corrected once they are well known.      But what if crypto, and specifically, decentralized finance (DeFi), could change the rules of the HFT game? If that sounds grandiose, it’s actually pragmatic when it comes to DeFi.    Jesus Rodriguez is the CEO of IntoTheBlock, a market intelligence platform for crypto assets. He has held leadership roles at major technology companies and hedge funds. He is an active investor, speaker, author and guest lecturer at Columbia University in New York.    Whether we are talking about equities, commodities, currencies or derivatives, HFT strategies operate over a similar infrastructure, including dark pool connectivity, order flow feeds and other pervasive building blocks such as algorithmic stablecoins. Based on blockchain protocols, DeFi is fintech that changes the dynamics of HFT strategies. It represents a new playground for HFT strategies, with new rules that challenge established HFT principles but also add new dimensions to an established industry.    A feature, not a bug    HFT is often seen as a byproduct of inefficiencies in the infrastructure of capital markets and the composition of specific financial products.      So, what happens when we have a new financial infrastructure that considers HFT and some variations like arbitrage trading as a key feature?      This is the case of DeFi automated market makers (AMMs) such as UniSwap, SushiSwap or Balancer, which leverage arbitrage as a mechanism to restore prices in liquidity pools to the right level. The transaction mechanism implemented by AMMs is far from being capital-efficient given that it could require a large number of translations to restore market-fair prices, but it certainly adds a different dimension to HFT. The idea of incorporating HFT mechanics at the core of a new financial instrument such as AMMs is an innovative concept in DeFi.      Flash loans seem to be designed with HFT as a first-class use case. The ability to request large pools of capital in a single transaction is key to enabling different types of HFT arbitrage strategies without requiring large pools of capital upfront. Integrating AMMs and flash loans has enabled products such as flash swaps that have become a favorite of HFT bots.      Other DeFi protocols such as private-pool integrators, algorithmic stablecoins or DeFi indexes seem ideal for HFT scenarios. In the world of DeFi, HFT is expected and even welcomed in some cases. But it’s a different type of HFT. DeFi has changed the dynamics of HFT to an environment in which speed is not the only relevant capability.    The programmable, on-chain nature of DeFi introduces new dimensions that determine the success or failure of HFT strategies  It’s not just about speed anymore    As its name suggests, trading speed has always been a hallmark of HFT techniques. That has been both a blessing and a curse because the HFT market has evolved around trying to get minuscule advantages in speed instead of fundamental technological innovations. In the case of DeFi, trading speed remains highly relevant but it’s far from being the only dominant of successful HFT strategies. The programmable, on-chain nature of DeFi introduces new dimensions that determine the success or failure of HFT strategies.      Though there are many differences between HFT in DeFi and traditional capital market structures, here are five factors that add new dimensions to the design and execution of HFT strategies in DeFi:    Block time speed factor    The simplest definition of HFT in DeFi is strategies that execute trades every block. In traditional markets, some of the most popular solutions to limit the advantage of HFT included introducing trading delays. In DeFi, that’s a native capability of the infrastructure.    Trade transparency factor    How do you design HFT strategies when everyone can see the trades you are trying to execute, and vice versa, you can see your competition’s trades? Transparency changes the nature of the HFT-DeFi game relative to traditional capital markets. Traders must build native constructs for aggressive competition with other strategies that try to front-back run it or simply compete with alternative strategies.    Cost factor    The infamous priority gas auctions (PGAs) in which arbitrageurs engage in transaction bidding has been one of the factors associated with the increase of gas costs in the Ethereum blockchain, and consequently, enable the growth in adoption of other blockchain runtimes such as Binance Smart Chain, Solana or Polygon. From the HFT perspective, strategies do not only need to consider the algorithmic logic behind specific trades but the cost associated with it. In many scenarios, perfectly viable HFT trades could lose their economic viability due to the cost associated with the execution of the transactions.    Read more: Opinion: Why Ethereum’s Miner Extractable Value Problem Is Way Worse Than You Think  MEV factor    Miner extractable value(MEV) has become one of the most debated concepts in DeFi in recent years. Initially coined by Phil Daian et al. in the paper “Flash Boys 2.0,” MEV describes the profit that a miner can make based on its ability to place transactions in a block in a specific order. MEV is an important concept in crypto economics and has profound implications in HFT-DeFi strategies. MEV imposes a constraint vector in HFT-DeFi strategies by relying on the miner’s economic interest to determine the ultimate placement of a transaction in a block. Plain and simple, perfectly viable HFT trades in a DeFi protocol can lose money because a miner placed the transaction in an order that favors another arbitrageur.      What’s more, MEV is completely obscure and makes every trade dependent on a party whose economic interest might not be aligned with a given HFT strategy. In recent months, protocols such as Flashbots, ArcherDAO and others have been trying to create more transparent and quantifiable dynamics to mitigate the impact of MEV.    Underlying protocol factor    In traditional capital markets, HFT traders interact with infrastructure that is relatively consistent across different asset classes that have been established for years. In the DeFi space, they need to interact with an infrastructure that is constantly changing with new protocols and runtimes. Playing with an unstable, constantly changing infrastructure presents challenges to HFT strategies in DeFi but also creates waves of new opportunities given the inefficiencies of new protocols entering the market.    A new arena for HFT    DeFi represents one of the most novel technological evolutions that can help trigger innovations in the HFT space. A nascent infrastructure with new financial protocols, blockchain runtimes and programmability as a first-class building block, make DeFi an ideal environment for HFT strategies.      However, HFT in DeFi is different from traditional capital markets. Factors such as block time speed, cost, transparency, MEV and nature of underlying protocols set different dynamics for HFT strategies in the DeFi. To capitalize on the opportunities in DeFi, HFT strategies can’t rely solely on execution speed anymore, and instead, need to leverage technical innovations tailored to the unique characteristics of the DeFi space. HFT in DeFi is not just Flash Boys HFT. It’s more transparent, technologically complex, and frankly, more interesting intellectually.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Jesus Rodriguez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/06/23/defi-is-the-next-frontier-of-high-frequency-trading,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9901da9ceeca677c4722861f79961c3662fd0fbf-1400x933.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434623,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPpbdh,1624466500,How One Ether Options Trader May Have Lost $3M in a Trade Gone Bad,"Editor's Note (June 24, 13:15 UTC): After publication of this article, Deribit, the exchange upon which the options trade in question was made, told CoinDesk that the party who took the loss on the $2,560 put option trade was a market maker (who is typically completely hedged) and the buyer made over $3 million. Per Deribit's CCO, the buyer opened the position during the bull run, leading to a sharp rise in open interest and the Wednesday's decline in open interest was the result of the client taking profit when the put traded at a much higher level as the ETH market dropped. Deribit didn't respond for requests for substantiation of the profit-making trade.      A trader may have just learned the hard way that it’s pretty easy to lose $3 million in the volatile world of the crypto options market, according to options analytics platform Genesis Volatility.      It appears the ether put options seller took a large bet against a sharp drop in the cryptocurrency and ended up booking a massive loss on Tuesday as the token powering Ethereum's blockchain tanked to a three-month low of $1,700, Genesis said.      “The market moved just enough to force the trader to take a loss by buying back 5,000 contracts of the December expiry $2,560 put option sold earlier this quarter,"" Gregoire Magadini, Genesis Volatility CEO, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat. ""The trade looks to have yielded a loss of over $3 million.""      A put option gives owners the right to sell the underlying asset (in this case, ether) at a set price on a certain date. Holders of the option make money when the price falls below that “strike” price and are implicitly short the asset. Conversely, sellers of the option benefit only when the asset trades above the strike and are implicitly long.      The ether options trader likely sold the $2,560 puts during the bull run, expecting a continued rally to last at least until the end of the year and thus a steady drop in the option's price.      Ether peaked above $4,000 on May 12, however, and fell to $1,700 on Tuesday, boosting the value of the $2,560 put and bringing sharp losses to the seller. The trade was executed and squared off on Deribit, the world's largest crypto options exchange, where one ether option contract represents 1 ETH.      The possible loss underscores that selling options, be it a put or a call, is a strategy better suited to institutions with ample capital supply and high-risk tolerance.      Data from the exchange shows the trade as it occured. The number of open positions in the $2,560 put expiring on Dec. 31 saw a 10-fold increase to more than 12,000 contracts in the four weeks ended May 12 — when ether prices doubled to over $4,000 — and fell by 5,000 contracts on Tuesday.      ""Majority of that open interest was opened on the short side,"" Magadini said.    Calculating the loss    The short position that was squared off on Tuesday likely saw around a $3 million loss. How so?      Due to data limitations, the exact price at which the trader sold 5,000 contracts of the $2,560 put is not available. Magadini, however, recommended using the put option's average price of $447 observed between mid-April and mid-May as the entry price for a profit-and-loss calculation. It's probable that the trader kept selling small quantities as ether moved higher during those four weeks.      So, the seller likely received $2.235 million in premium by selling 5,000 contracts at an average price of $447. Those contracts, however, were repurchased on Tuesday at a much higher per contract price of $1,080, amounting to a total outlay of $5.44 million.      Essentially, the trader sold puts at $2.235 million a few weeks ago and then repurchased them for $5.44 million on Tuesday, netting a loss of over $3 million. That amount may seem heavy, but the trader likely did so out of fear the position would bleed further losses.      The puts’ value began rising as ether fell below $2,500 last week and surged to $1,080 during Tuesday's early U.S. hours, when the cryptocurrency itself dipped to $1,800.      The short position was squared off when ether was near the lowest point of the day.      Further, it was closed on Deribit and not through an over-the-counter desk like Paradigm, a preferred venue for institutions. Magadini, therefore, believes it was a classic case of a retail investor getting burned by selling options.      Lastly, some informed readers might wonder if the short position was a part of the bull put spread or other complex strategies. A bull put spread consists of selling a higher strike put and buying a lower strike put with the same expiry and profits from a rising market or consolidation. The advantage here is that the long leg of the strategy caps losses during a sell-off and is a much safer way of collecting extra yield during bull runs than selling a naked put.      But there is no evidence that the sell position in the $2,560 put was accompanied by a buy position in the put options at lower strikes. Had that been the case, the trader would have squared off the buy leg along with the short leg on Tuesday, causing a big drop in open interest in puts below $2,560. That doesn't seem to be the case here.      ""We haven't seen other options closed along with the December expiry $2,560 puts,"" Magadini noted.

42434603,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPpbXh,1624459218,Bukele’s Bitcoin Blunder for El Salvador,"In the middle of the night of June 8, El Salvador passed a new law making bitcoin legal tender – actually, forced tender. The high priest of El Salvador’s bitcoin evangelicals is none other than President Nayib Bukele. One of his favorite sermonshttps://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/iae/files/2021/06/Bukeles-Bitcoin-Blunder-Final.pdf is “The Beauty of Bitcoin.” The reverend claims that bitcoin will result in a dramatic reduction in the cost of transmitting remittances to El Salvadorans. If that’s not bad enough, Jack Mallers, one of Bukele’s deacons and the CEO of the mobile-payments app Strike, a company that will apparently be granted a monopoly franchise over El Salvador’s bitcoin remittance scheme, sermonizes that, “If you send $50 to El Salvador, it will cost 25 bucks.” Are these sermons factually based?  Steve H. Hanke is a Professor of Applied Economics at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and Founder and Co-Director of the Johns Hopkins Institute for Applied Economics, Global Health, and the Study of Business Enterprise, where Nicholas Hanlon is the Chief of Staff.  El Salvador depends heavily on remittances. They make up 21% of El Salvador’s gross domestic product, the second highest of any country in the Western Hemisphere. Traditionally, remittances are sent and received via money-transfer services provided by private companies. According to the World Bank, in the first quarter, these companies (Western Union, MoneyGram, Ria and Remitly) chargedhttps://remittanceprices.worldbank.org/en/corridor/United-States/El-Salvador between 0%-4% fees for a $200 remittance, depending on the transfer method.  The greenback is king    As it turns out, El Salvador benefits from some of the lowest remittance costs in the world. Indeed, it has the sixth-lowest remittance costs of the 104 countries monitored by the World Bank. Not surprisingly, El Salvador’s remittance costs are the lowest of any country in the Latin American-Caribbean region, with the average transaction fee for sending a remittance at 2.85%.      What about bitcoin remittances? Well, for one thing, most El Salvadorans are not interested in bitcoin. They don’t want to use it. They prefer the U.S. dollar, which has been El Salvador’s legal tender since 2001, when El Salvador mothballed the colón and put it in a museum. In what has been, in effect, a real-world pilot study of a bitcoin-based economy, El Salvador’s Bitcoin Beach, people don’t use bitcoin for a variety of reasons (according to a Reuters report). Furthermore, 82.5% of more than 1,600 respondents to a survey by El Salvador’s Chamber of Commerce said that they don't want to receive remittances in bitcoin. Also, 93.5% said they don't want to receive their salaries in bitcoin. In El Salvador, bitcoin is for the birds. The greenback is king.    Read more: Opinion – Why El Salvador’s Plan Isn’t as Crazy as You Think    One of the many reasons why El Salvadorans eschew bitcoin is, in fact, the high cost of dealing in bitcoin. At present, if Salvadorans without bank accounts (70% of the population) are sent bitcoin, but want dollars, they must exchange bitcoin for dollars at a bitcoin ATM. Unfortunately for El Salvadorans, there are currently only two bitcoin ATMs in the country, both located in the small, coastal area that has been dubbed “Bitcoin Beach.” Athena, the manufacturer of one of the two bitcoin ATMs in El Salvador, plans to bring more ATMs into the county. But exchanging bitcoin for dollars at an Athena ATM costs a 5% minimum fee. And that 5% is just Athena’s cut – it does not include the “network fee” to execute the transaction, or the travel costs and inconvenience associated with going to an ATM, as well as the security and safety costs associated with using the ATM to obtain those greenbacks that Salvadorans prefer.      The bitcoin evangelicals’ math just doesn’t add up. Remittances sent via traditional money-transfer services have a realized cost of only 2.85%. But, remittances sent via bitcoin will require Salvadorans to cough up much more than 5% to obtain the dollars they want. It’s clear that remittance costs are not the reason that Bukele is preaching from the bitcoin pulpit. We wonder who’s crafting his sermons?",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,"Steve Hanke, Nicholas Hanlon",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/06/23/bukeles-bitcoin-blunder-for-el-salvador,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0f3187a1b25b537798adda4e8141a746b08af124-1400x933.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434582,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPpb1h,1624457602,Why Bitcoin Could Be Good for El Salvador,"The news that the president of El Salvador plans to adopt BTC as an alternative to the U.S. dollar for transactions in his country has caused quite a stir. Bitcoin has captured its first country. Reactions have varied from “wow, this is BIG for bitcoin” to “this is not going to end well.”  As ever, the truth is probably somewhere in the middle. It’s not a major coup for bitcoin, but it could work quite well for El Salvador. And, importantly, it might establish a real-world use case for bitcoin that doesn’t involve crashing the entire global monetary system. I don’t think bitcoin will replace the dollar as the premier global settlement and reserve currency, but that doesn’t mean it couldn’t be good for some countries.    Frances Coppola, a CoinDesk columnist, is a freelance writer and speaker on banking, finance and economics. Her book, “The Case for People’s Quantitative Easing,” explains how modern money creation and quantitative easing work, and advocates “helicopter money” to help economies out of recession.    El Salvador (population 6.5 million) is a “dollarized” economy. It doesn’t have a currency of its own. Instead, it uses the U.S. dollar as its domestic currency. El Salvador’s relationship with the U.S. is not like that of a U.S. state, or even a territory such as Puerto Rico. It is an independent sovereign country that chooses to use the dollar instead of issuing its own currency. El Salvador is not subject to U.S. law and the U.S. government has no jurisdiction there.    Lee este artículo en español.    Because it doesn’t produce its own currency, El Salvador’s government can’t print money. And it doesn’t benefit from the Federal Reserve’s money creation. The Fed is not in any way responsible for ensuring that El Salvador has enough dollars for domestic use. So, El Salvador must either borrow or earn the dollars it needs.      It can earn dollars by exporting more than it imports and by receiving dollar remittances from its citizens working overseas. If those two sources don’t provide enough dollars to meet domestic needs, both the private sector and the government can borrow dollars on international markets.      Currently, El Salvador exports less than it imports, but remittances are large enough to ensure that its “current account” – the net value of all its transactions with the rest of the world – remains slightly positive. On balance, therefore, El Salvador is receiving net dollar inflows. But the government is borrowing heavily: In the last couple of years, government debt has risen to over 90% of gross domestic product, and borrowing costs are rising. It’s unclear how much more the government will be able to borrow.      Furthermore, dollar flows are volatile. It’s only a few years since a commodities price crash caused dollar inflows for countries such as Nigeria and Angola to reverse abruptly, forcing them to sell down their dollar reserves to maintain their currency pegs to USD. A dollarized economy such as El Salvador doesn’t need reserves to maintain a currency peg, but it does need dollar reserves to maintain liquidity for domestic banks, businesses and households. Running short of dollars can force it to close its banks and sharply curtail government spending.      In its 2019 Article IV report, the International Monetary Fund said that El Salvador’s dollar reserves are too low for its economy. El Salvador needs more dollar income, and that means developing export industries and encouraging overseas workers to send more dollars home. Earning some income from its existing reserves would also help. Today’s near-zero interest rates on safe dollar investments aren’t good for countries like El Salvador.      Considering all of that, adopting BTC as a second currency doesn’t look like a bad idea. There are several potential benefits.      First, using bitcoin to send remittances could be easier, cheaper and faster for overseas workers than using money transmission services or bank wire transfers, so remittances might increase. Of course, remittances would need to be exchanged for dollars inside El Salvador, but that could be achieved with a phone app linked to a cryptocurrency exchange.      Alternatively, citizens could use their BTC directly to pay for goods and services, and merchants could be provided with the means to exchange BTC for dollars. There’s obviously a risk that BTC exchanges would fail because of a lack of dollar liquidity within El Salvador. So, the El Salvadoran government proposed to establish a trust fund initially worth $150 million in the state development bank Bandesal, which would guarantee liquidity for the exchanges. And a version of the Strike app is being prepared for use by Salvadorans, though it’s not clear yet exactly how that would work.      Second, diversifying the country’s dollar reserves into bitcoin could create opportunities to earn yield, thus increasing the size of the reserves.      Third, a partially ""bitcoinized"" economy could be attractive as a home for bitcoin investors and headquarters for bitcoin businesses, which could raise the country’s GDP. And it would also create an opportunity to develop new bitcoin-based businesses. The government has already proposed a scheme to use geothermal energy to power bitcoin mining.      If this partial ""bitcoinization"" scheme works, then El Salvador could increase both its reserves and its GDP, reducing the pressure on government borrowing costs and potentially freeing up money for social programs.    Downside risks    There are serious risks, however.      By far the biggest is the possibility that the country will run out of U.S. dollars. Diversifying into bitcoin may improve the earning potential of the reserves, but BTC’s price is notoriously volatile. A crash such as that in 2018 would wipe out 80% of the country’s dollar reserves, potentially forcing the banks to close and making it impossible for the government to meet its USD obligations. El Salvador defaulted in 2017. Diversifying into BTC could force it into another default.      A BTC crash would also seriously hurt Salvadorans who had wholly or partly adopted BTC for remittance income and savings. And it would cause a run on BTC by businesses that have a guaranteed exchange route into the U.S. dollar, because it would be in their interests to exchange their devaluing BTC for USD. That $150 million trust fund would very quickly run dry.      Even without a major BTC crash, the country could still run short of U.S. dollars. Converting remittance income to BTC unfortunately reduces dollar inflows and hence increases the risk of dollar shortages. It’s easy to buy bitcoin with U.S. dollars, but not so easy to sell it for U.S. dollars, especially when lots of other people are all trying to sell at the same time. Stablecoins such as USDT (tether) can be a temporary hedge against BTC volatility, but they aren’t much use for businesses and governments that have dollar debts that must be serviced.      Also, the rest of the world might not be too enthusiastic about lending dollars to a country that had diversified its reserves into BTC and run short of dollars as a result. The IMF, which is currently in negotiations with El Salvador about a potential loan, has already expressed some concern.      There’s a different kind of risk too – and one that unfortunately has all too often come to pass in Latin America. That is the risk that the monetary tightness caused by dollar shortages and BTC illiquidity proves unbearable, and the government starts issuing its own currency, perhaps in the form of a stablecoin. Initially, that might be fully backed by its dollar and BTC reserves in a currency board type of arrangement similar to that in Hong Kong. But BTC’s volatility makes this hugely problematic. Even a small BTC crash would leave the currency partially unbacked.      Furthermore, if the desire of the government to give away money outstripped the ability of the productive economy to earn dollars and BTC, the currency board might quickly turn into a permanent fractional reserve type of arrangement. That would leave the new currency wide open to a speculative attack designed to drain the reserves and force it off its peg.    Read more: Nic Carter: El Salvador Doesn’t Need a Bitcoin Mandate    It’s essential that El Salvador’s government resists the temptation to buy short-term improvement to economic growth and welfare by issuing large amounts of a new fiat currency or stablecoin only partly backed by hard currency reserves. That’s a recipe for a foreign exchange crisis, debt default and hyperinflation. Too many countries in Latin America have played this scene before. It’s a risk El Salvador really shouldn’t take.      So I’m giving a qualified welcome to El Salvador’s scheme. It could work, but there are enormous risks and temptations. And it must be connected with serious efforts to attract inward investment and develop export industries. Changing the monetary regime is all very well, but in the end, it is production of real goods and services that matters. That’s where the wealth of nations comes from.      If this scheme works, it’s obviously good for bitcoin, as it would establish it as a national currency and minor reserve asset. And, believe it or not, I hope it does work. I’d like to see El Salvador achieve prosperity, and if bitcoin can help it do that, then that’s a great use of bitcoin.      For me, that is far more important than dreams of world domination. It would mean bitcoin was making a real difference to the lives of real people. And that’s what really matters.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Frances Coppola,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/06/23/why-bitcoin-could-be-good-for-el-salvador,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/77121c5bb762f72b32f1b734d62ecfb7c0e17c99-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Under the baseball deal, FTX branding will appear on all umpire uniforms starting at the All-Star Game in Denver on July 13 and continue into the postseason.

In a tweet, Bankman-Fried said FTX and MLB have plans on ""collaborating on products and experiences together."" The deal includes a provision with the MLB Players Association to ""use highlights of players in content creation,"" according to Wednesday’s press release.      Naming rights for the Miami Heat arena went for $135 million in a 19-year deal.

42434607,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPpbbh,1624447800,Valid Points: Why EIP 1559 Matters to Eth 2.0 Validators,"ETH prices took a tumble this week, dropping over 30% between last Tuesday and today. In the wake of stricter crackdowns on cryptocurrencies by the People’s Bank of China, other top coins such as bitcoin and XRP also declined in value.      While the week-to-week volatility of the crypto markets is as unpredictable as ever, the total value managed by smart contracts on Ethereum has been consistently on the rise since Jan. 1. In this week’s Pulse Check, we discuss what that suggests about the long-term value drivers for ETH.      Also, we explore the implications of an upcoming code change to Ethereum’s fee market to Ethereum 2.0 validators.    This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk's weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum 2.0 and its sweeping impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to Valid Points here.  Pulse check: ETH held in smart contracts rises  Read more: Ethereum 2.0 Explained in 4 Easy Metrics    Since January, the amount of ether (ETH) held in smart contracts has increased over 50% to an all-time high of 26.7 million ETH, worth roughly $50 billion. Meanwhile, the amount of ETH held on cryptocurrency exchanges fell to a two-year low of 13 million ETH.      As background, smart contracts are accounts on Ethereum that are controlled by self-executing code as opposed to a user. These accounts can be engineered to trigger transactions according to a set of predefined rules and conditions. As of June 2021, close to one quarter of total ETH supply is held and managed by smart contract accounts.      The most popular smart contracts on Ethereum, according to analysis by Anthony Sassano, co-founder of the “EthHub” podcast, are finance-focused and enable users to earn attractive yields on their ETH. Of the 26 million ETH held in smart contracts, roughly 8.5 million is used within decentralized finance (DeFi) apps such as MakerDAO, Aave, Compound and Uniswap.      After DeFi apps, the Ethereum 2.0 deposit contract, which is the smart contract that creates validators on the Eth 2.0 Beacon Chain, is the second-most popular by total value locked, holding around 5.8 million ETH.      Increasing value in these smart contracts suggests the use case for ether as a speculative asset to trade on exchanges is growing weaker while the asset’s narrative as an interest-bearing crypto asset to be used within the decentralized application (dapp) ecosystem of Ethereum is taking off.      “It’s all about what the ETH is actually being used for and if the utility of Ethereum is driving demand for more ETH. I believe that it clearly is,” Sassano wrote in his newsletter, The Daily Gwei.    New frontiers: The impact of EIP 1559    Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559 is one of five code changes that will be activated on the main Ethereum network some time this summer. It introduces a new pricing mechanism for transactions based on a minimum fee called the “base fee” that is automatically calculated by the protocol, instead of being set by the user.      The following is an edited excerpt from CoinDesk Research's latest report about EIP 1559 and its impact on miners and Eth 2.0 validators.    Goodbye transaction fees, hello inclusion fees    Miner revenue consists of two main sources, a block subsidy and transaction fees. EIP 1559 removes transaction fees as an income source for miners and replaces it with the inclusion fee. Because the inclusion fee is both optional and an additional fee on top of the base fee that users must pay for their transactions, it is likely the income earned from the inclusion fee will be less than what miners would have earned under Ethereum’s auction-style fee market.      It is difficult to estimate exactly how much miners can expect to lose in revenue given the variability of the inclusion fee and the difficult-to-quantify revenue that miners can also receive by reordering or censoring transactions on the network. This third, lesser-known revenue stream, known as miner extractable value (MEV), is becoming increasingly widespread with the growth of decentralized exchanges (DEXs) on Ethereum.      Miners have the ability to earn more rewards from DEX traders who value the speed and order in which their transactions are executed on the blockchain more than the average user does. They can also take advantage of arbitrage opportunities on DEXs themselves by executing lucrative cryptocurrency trades that front-run DEX traders.      Once proof-of-stake (PoS) is activated on Ethereum sometime early next year, Eth 2.0 validators will take over the responsibility of ordering transactions from miners and begin pocketing two additional revenue streams, user inclusion fees and MEV, on top of the rewards they currently receive as interest on their staked ether.    Warming up for the merge    Like the upcoming merge to PoS, EIP 1559 will get activated on Ethereum through a backward-incompatible upgrade or “hard fork.”      There is the potential with any hard fork activation to see a chain split in the network, with some portion of miners, validators or users running outdated client software. Usually, these chain splits are temporary as the majority of miners will eventually congregate to one version of the chain to produce blocks and earn rewards. The minority chain in these cases fizzles out due to a lack of computational energy to move it forward beyond a few blocks. Since its launch in 2015, Ethereum has been through 10 hard forks and disruptive chain splits have been extremely rare.      Hard forks require coordination from all network stakeholders, which is why they become progressively more difficult to execute the larger and more decentralized Ethereum becomes. It’s one of the reasons why developers for the Bitcoin protocol have arguably never released a planned hard fork upgrade. The norm for code changes on Bitcoin are “soft” forks, which maintain backward compatibility with older client versions.      In order to avoid an unintentional chain split, Ethereum developers are leading community initiatives to spread awareness and support for the “London” hard fork, leading up to its activation date. These initiatives include public community calls, one-on-one outreach to large businesses operating on Ethereum and online guides for network stakeholders. Similar initiatives will be needed to ensure a smooth transition to PoS once research and development for the merge is complete.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value was trading around $34,000 at press time and is up 9% over the past 24 hours.

Bitcoin’s two-month downtrend appears exhausted after the relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart registered a higher low. This means buyers could remain active towards upper resistance levels.  The RSI on the four-hour chart is not yet overbought, although bitcoin is still below the 100-period moving average, suggesting resistance could be found at $36,000.

42434598,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPpbPh,1624446000,BIS Says Bitcoin Has Few Redeeming Attributes,"The Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the organization that represents most of the world's central banks, panned bitcoin in its Annual Economic Report, saying the cryptocurrency has few redeeming qualities.      The bank offered a stiff criticism of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general in a chapter from the report published Wednesday ahead of its full release on June 29. Cryptocurrencies are ""speculative assets rather than money"" and are used in many cases to facilitate financial crime such as money laundering and ransomware attacks.      ""Bitcoin in particular has few redeeming public interest attributes when also considering its wasteful energy footprint,"" the report said.      The report arrived less than two weeks after the BIS' Basel Committee indicated the risk level it assigns to crypto assets by proposing that banks with exposure to them should set aside capital to cover any losses.      Stablecoins, which are designed be less volatile than other crypto assets by being backed by fiat currencies, also came under scrutiny. The report called them an ""attempt to import credibility,"" and said that they are ""only as good as the governance behind the promise of the backing"" and that they threaten to ""fragment the liquidity of the monetary system.""    CBDCs ""moving from concept to design""    Cryptocurrencies and stablecoins are highlighted as part of a triple-pronged threat to mainstream financial services, alongside disruption by big tech.      The BIS set these threats against the backdrop of growing interest in central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), which have drawn the interest of most central banks around the world.      CBDCs are moving from concept to design, the report said, and could reshape the institution of money.      The bank said digital cash should be designed with the public interest in mind, ensuring an ""open payment platform"" beneath the shadow of a competitive level playing field.      It noted that the benefits of a CBDC depend on the competitive structure of the underlying payment system and data-governance arrangements. CBDCs built on digital identification could improve cross-border payments, limiting the risks of currency substitution, it said.      According to the BIS, CBDCs would function optimally if they are based on a two-tier system where the majority of customer-facing activity is taken on by commercial banks and other payment providers.      Three months ago, the bank released a detailed research note outlining the importance of countries collaborating to eliminate traditional banking frictions for CBDCs.      The bank also noted the most ""promising design"" for everyday use of CBDCs is if they were built atop an identity scheme, whereby data privacy would be safeguarded while staving off illicit activity. While not entirely new concepts, the discussion shows CBDCs, in the eyes of the bank for central banks, are on their radar.

42434606,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPpbZh,1624444251,Bitcoin Likely to Be Rangebound After Rebound From $29K,"While bitcoin seems to have found a bottom, a quick rally to record highs looks unlikely, analysts told CoinDesk on Wednesday, saying the cryptocurrency now faces price consolidation.      ""Bitcoin looks to have bottomed out, having digested most negative news during the recent sell-off from $41,000 to $29,000,"" trader and analyst Alex Kruger said.      Prices topped $41,000 early last week before turning south in the latter half after the Federal Reserve's unexpected hawkish tilt on interest rates.      Bearish sentiment strengthened on Monday after the People's Bank of China reiterated its crypto banking ban in the wake of the Chinese government's crackdown on crypto mining. Bitcoin extended the previous week's sell-off, hitting five-month lows near $29,000 during early U.S. hours Tuesday.      Still, prices had bounced back to $32,000 by the day's end (23:59 UTC). At press time, the cryptocurrency is changing hands near $33,730, a 3.9% gain on the day, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      With the quick recovery, bitcoin has re-entered the broad range of $30,000 to $40,000 established in the aftermath of the mid-May sell-off. Kruger expects consolidation to continue for some time unless ""there is another major bearish China headline.""      Stack Funds is also maintaining a cautious stance despite signs of bargain hunting.      ""We have noticed that whales [large investors] are re-entering the market as risk appetite returns,"" it said in a research noted published Wednesday. Short-squeeze hunters are also exiting the market, it said.      ""We believe bitcoin is very close to the bottom, at least in this current wave,"" analysts noted. However, ""we will keep a close eye on bitcoin's price post options expiry, and it will be interesting to see how this will unfold in the first week of July, the start of the third quarter.""      Bitcoin options worth more than $2 billion are set to expire Friday. The monthly expiries have gained prominence this year as volatility-inducing events.    Focus on USD    According to Nick Mancini, a research analyst at Trade the Chain, a continued rally in bitcoin needs a weaker U.S. dollar.      Bitcoin has been one of the major beneficiaries of the Fed's massive stimulus programs launched a year ago. So a continued recovery in the dollar on fears of an impending Fed tightening could hamper bitcoin's progress.      ""Bitcoin and the dollar index have developed an inverse relationship since the last week's Federal Reserve meeting,"" Mancini said. ""We believe that if bitcoin wants to gain strength, given current market conditions, the dollar needs to become weaker.      The dollar index, which tracks the greenback's value against major fiat currencies, has risen by 1.43% since the Fed meeting. Bitcoin, meantime, is down at least 10% from the pre-Fed highs.      Some observers say the Fed taper fears are here to stay and could keep bitcoin's gains in check. ""Concerns about the outlook for Fed policy and the impact of a shift to less-accommodative policy on account of rising inflation that may not be transitory pose downside risk to bitcoin's price,"" Joel Kruger, currency strategist at LMAX Digital, said.      Also read: China's Anti-Crypto Crackdown Is Different This Time      At a minimum, bitcoin needs to see a break above $41,325 to suggest we’ve bottomed,"" Kruger said.

Carlson will help the company “build” its “strategic partnerships and rapid adoption among developers, financial firms, multinationals and governments,” Chia said in a press release shared with CoinDesk.      “Jill’s knowledge, combined with her alignment for our mission to radically improve global financial and payments systems, will help drive our business forward,” Chia President and COO Gene Hoffmann said in the release.      Carlson's involvement represents the latest win for Chia, which has been on a growth spurt. It is also an offshoot of the friendship between Carlson and Cohen, which dates to their joint conference appearances in 2017 and 2018. The pair, who have continued to meet at industry events, rank among the industry’s most influential figures and often share insights.      “I’m thrilled to be joining the Chia team as we look to supercharge adoption and provide an eco-friendly way to deliver decentralized finance opportunities for people around the world,” said Carlson, who is also an investor with San Francisco-based Slow Ventures and member of the World Economic Forum's Global Future Council on Cryptocurrencies.      Carlson co-launched the Open Money Initiative in 2019 to explore how people use money in closed economies and disintegrating currency systems.    Read more: Blockchain Payments Platform Chia on an ‘Accelerated Timeline’ to IPO    Earlier this year, she joined the board of the non-profit Mina Foundation, which supports the Mina lightweight blockchain protocol. But she has been selective about accepting directorship positions. Chia's mission dovetailed with central, intertwining themes in her career of boosting access to financial services and operational efficiency.      ""For anyone working in this space, it comes down to asking yourself every day, 'Here are the things that I'm spending time on, do I believe in them, do I believe that they are going to be impactful on the lives of people?'"" Carlson said in an interview with Coindesk.      She sees Chia's approach as an ""alternative"" to financial products that ""fail users"" and ""exclude people.""      Chia touts its decentralized blockchain and smart transaction platform as more energy efficient than competing systems. It launched its mainnet on March 17 and began enabling transactions on May 3.      Last month, the San Francisco-based company closed a $61 million D funding round spearheaded by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) and Richmond Global Ventures. Slow Ventures also participated in the capital raise. At the time, Chia had an estimated $500 million valuation, according to a Bloomberg report, and Cohen has been upfront about his intent to take the company public in the near future.
