42404072,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhFn5,1582318800,"Sweden's Central Bank Finally Embraces DLT, but Only in Simulation Mode","Sweden’s central bank will soon trial a blockchain-based digital currency – but it’s still in its very early stages, at best.      Announced Thursday, Sveriges Riksbank’s e-krona pilot is the latest attempt at a central bank digital currency (CBDC) from an institution that for years fretted over basing any such project on distributed ledger technology (DLT).      For now at least, the e-krona pilot is set to move forward on a limited basis. Built by Accenture and based on R3 Corda, Riksbank's digital currency trials will run as a simulation through February 2021, at which point Riksbank could extend the project for another six years.      The pilot will not involve any banks or end-users; everything will be simulated within the central bank’s closed network. Accenture is still preparing the final system for testing, according to Riksbank's press office.      This high-profile investigation of digital government money will “increase [Riksbank's] knowledge” of CBDCs, the bank said in a report. But it will also better Riksbank's understanding of DLT and ""blockchain technology,"" two nearly synonymous tech solutions (in the bank's stated view) that it spent nearly three years arguing was too ""immature"" to use for the e-krona pilot.      Forced into action by its citizens’ deep aversion to cash, Riksbank has been talking about developing a possible “e-krona” since at least November 2016. But it was never clear about what technology could power a Swedish digital currency.      DLT has been an option since the project formally began in September 2017. But it was hardly the obvious choice for a bank that saw the “existing tried-and-tested” centralized technologies as perhaps more compelling.      “From a purely technical point of view, we can see nothing at this point in time that would prevent an e-krona solution built around a central register,” Riksbank wrote in that first e-krona project report. “RIX, the Riksbank’s system for the transfer of funds in accounts, is, for example, built around a central register. An e-krona could in principle be constructed in a similar way.”      Riksbank was not willing to take a leap on the still-developing tech back in 2017. It described DLT as weak, troublesome and untried in the report – “this is partly due to the technology being so new” – a still-uncharted solution to digital-currency-minded central bankers around the world.      Riksbank appears to have concluded that Corda addresses its previous DLT concerns, the Feb. 20 report shows. Using bitcoin (BTC) as a DLT foil, Riksbank argues Corda consumes less energy and is more scalable while still preventing users from committing double-spending.    The new system    In the simulated system, the Riksbank's node will issue e-krona to participant nodes, banks. The banks will then distribute digital cash to end-users: consumers and merchants. Users will then hold the e-krona in digital wallets – on smartphones, wearable tech, cards – that make “peer-to-peer payments as easily as sending a text,” according to the most recent report.      The system will also carry some of the permissioned features anathema to decentralization maximalists but integral to organized governance and central banks: Riksbank alone will have control over its private network and hold the sole power to add new participant nodes to that system.      ""Centralize it too far, and the exercise of creating [a CBDC] becomes rather pointless,” said Don Guo, CEO of brokerage tech provider Broctagon Fintech Group. “The founding principal of crypto was decentralization, so banks need to be careful that they don’t lose sight of the advantages that decentralization can provide, otherwise there will be no real benefit of using the new currencies over fiat.”      The bank will not commit to launching an e-krona – in any form – just yet. That’s “ultimately a political decision,” Riksbank said in the report. But the yearlong pilot will illustrate how DLT e-krona “technical solution” might work in the country that long said it couldn’t.      The pilot will also help Riksbank determine if, how, when and in what form it might issue digital money to the people of Sweden.      More broadly, a focus on centralized thinking continues to circulate in the central banker community. For technical and philosophical reasons regarding governance and control, bankers hesitate to embrace DLT for CBDC, according to speakers at Friday's Conference on Central Bank Digital Currencies in Ukraine.      That comes as banks actively test DLT across other aspects of their financial infrastructure. Even in October 2018, when Riksbank was issuing its second report on the e-krona, bankers in Canada, Singapore, Japan and the Eurozone were all looking into DLT for large interbank payments.      Riksbank is more interested in developing a retail payments solution for Sweden; it wants a digital krona that consumers, not bankers, can use on the go. And though it spent years considering DLT as one solution among many, Riksbank's reports always left the door ajar.      ""Technological development continues apace,"" the 2018 report said. ""The Project cannot therefore rule out a DLT solution becoming relevant in the longer term.""

According to an indictment filed Friday, Fowler allegedly created a scheme to obtain money ""by means of false and fraudulent pretenses"" and directed the funds to a professional sports league. While the indictment does not name the league, Fowler was previously the primary investor in the Alliance of American Football, a short-lived alternative to the National Football League that collapsed in the middle of its first season last year.      Fowler was originally arrested for allegedly operating Global Trading Solutions LLC, which appears to be tied to Crypto Capital, a payment processor crypto exchanges used to access banking services.      ""Fowler defrauded individuals associated with a professional sports league (the 'League') in connection with his acquisition of an ownership stake in the League, inter alia, (i) by falsely claiming personal ownership of funds that were, in truth and in fact, funds Fowler had obtained through the unlicensed money transmitting business charged in Count Four of this Indictment and (ii) by converting those individuals' funds toward his investment in the League,"" according to the updated indictment.      QuadrigaCX and Bitfinex are two of the exchanges that apparently used Crypto Capital to process user funds.      Fowler originally pleaded not guilty to the money transmission business and bank fraud charges, but announced late last year he would change his plea. Under a tentative plea agreement he would have pleaded guilty to one charge of operating an unlicensed money transmitter, but Fowler did not consent to forfeiting $371 million he allegedly holds or held in bank accounts.      He rejected the plea deal earlier this month.      According to a memo approved by U.S. District Judge Andrew Carter, of the Southern District of New York, pretrial motions will be filed by Feb. 28, oppositions will be filed by March 13 and replies will be due by March 20.

42383322,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vDEh,1582311012,Wikipedia Co-Founder Says Crypto Integration Would Be 'Completely Insane',"Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales said Friday he has not seen a single practical use-case to convince him to integrate cryptocurrencies or blockchain into the platform.      Speaking at the CoinGeek Conference in London, Jimmy Wales said cryptocurrencies would not add anything useful to Wikipedia. In fact, he believed it would prove detrimental to its vision and ultimately damage the unique way in which the platform operates.      Speaking opposite Craig Wright, Wales said he tried to distinguish between the ideological and practical nature of cryptocurrencies. Wales has already turned down proposals from advocates, who asked him to consider making it possible for users to directly reward content creators and editors with digital assets.      ""This is a really bad idea. It's an idea that doesn't actually work,"" Wales said. ""If you take something that is a bad idea and put it on the blockchain, that doesn't necessarily make it a good idea.""      Wikipedia relies on volunteer experts and enthusiasts to add and edit new content, as well as to check facts and remove inaccurate or irrelevant material, Wales said. By integrating cryptocurrencies, Wikipedia would be ""taking a step back"" by making it easier for people and companies to pay for the content they want on the platform, he said.      ""Creating a mechanism where you effectively authenticate that type of behavior ... isn't going to help with the quality of Wikipedia at all,"" Wales said.      Wales also said getting creators and editors to stake cryptocurrency would ""seriously harm"" Wikipedia.      ""To say to them, you're going to have to pay or put money at risk in order to edit Wikipedia is completely insane,"" he said.      If the platform made people place deposits, they could exclude experts and enthusiasts who contribute out of interest in their chosen topic. In their place would be people effectively competing against one another to create and edit content, as well as flag inaccurate entries, for monetary gain, he argued.      While he opposed creating incentives for Wikipedia posters, Wales said he had no problem with the platform accepting donations in different forms of cryptocurrency. Wikipedia is a charity and has accepted donations in bitcoin (BTC) since 2014.      There was some controversy when Wales was announced as the headline speaker at the CoinGeek's conference in London.

42411657,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glXSVf,1582304608,"The Internet Is a Right, Not a Luxury: 30% of Americans Still Don’t Have It","Gigi Sohn has spent the last 30 years as a public interest advocate. Her main focus, nowadays? Getting telecommunications giants to take on fiduciary duty. Now that the internet has become “the essential communications tool of the 21st century,” Sohn thinks broadband connection is a right, not a privilege. This doesn’t mean that she’s on board with all technological advancements. Sohn, an ex-senior staffer at the Federal Communications Commission, has her doubts about a lot of things that may look like progress, including 5G and the potential repeal of Section 230, which exempts internet companies from responsibility for content they publish. CoinDesk called Sohn for a brief interview about key election topics for the tech industry including reinstating net neutrality, expanding internet access and the realities of internet throttling.  Why have you dedicated such a significant portion of your life to fighting for internet connectivity?  Well, internet access is the fundamental 21st century communications technology. Yet, 30 percent of people do not have access to a fixed broadband connection at home. Believe it or not, policymakers say broadband is a luxury, not a necessity. I would love to ask them to give the internet up for a week and see how it feels. Without access to the internet, it’s impossible to fully participate in the economy, society and in culture. Even applying for the most menial jobs today necessitates broadband access. Sure, you can go to the library, but the advantages of using it in your home are incalculable. If you don't have internet at home, you're sitting outside of McDonald's or using a mobile phone. That’s not acceptable.  What do you define as decent internet connectivity?  25MB per second down and 3 up is outdated. 100 symmetrical is a better definition, but it depends on how many devices will be connected. Some people will never get an internet connection; that's fine. The issue is, most cannot afford it.  What’s standing in the way of affordable internet connectivity as you’ve defined it?  Several, but it all comes down to the cost of the service. There's a lack of competition. Competition drives down price. My prescriptions have to do with driving down the cost, and increasing the availability of low-cost $10–15 per month subscriptions. A lot of places without affordable internet access are not served by cable. In rural areas the small providers get government money, millions of dollars to provide service, and [are] essentially a monopoly. If the government is giving you a handout, you should have to provide a $10 option. Comcast has [its] $10 a month option, which is commendable but has some limitations. Charter has a $15 per month plan, which is … commendable. I also think, those already receiving government support should be eligible for the Lifeline program.  Is there any merit to FCC Chairman Ajit Pai’s claims that repealing net neutrality would increase competition among ISPs?  I don’t think Pai ever said it would promote competition. I think he said it would increase investments. Though what he’s done by reclassifying broadband as a Title 1 service is abdicating the FCC’s role in the market, whose remit was to promote competition and promote investments. It’s the competitive environment that determines investment, not the amount of regulations. That is now conclusively proven. Once Title Two [of the Telecommunications Act, the framework in which the FCC was able to investigate and charge broadband providers as utilities] was eliminated, most major broadband providers slowed their investments.  Why is that?  There is little competition for fixed broadband service. You're lucky if you have access to two providers. It’s a rarity to have three or four. Investments are more closely correlated with upgrades to technology and infrastructure. Take 5G. All mobile companies have been upgrading their networks to 5G. These investments started several years ago. Imagine that, even during the horrible Title 2 times, there was significant investment. It’s a false narrative that regulatory oversight stymies competition and growth. Right now we’re in a period where there aren’t upgrades. All the 5G funding has already been spent. Classifications, as in labeling broadband providers Title 1 or Title 2, do not matter one way or another to investments. It's all about the state of technology.  Speaking of 5G, I honestly don’t understand what it is. I see commercials from Verizon advertising 5G service, and also hear the U.S. is in a competitive race to 5G with China. Is it here or not?  It’s partially arrived. There was a Super Bowl ad, I think it was a Super Bowl ad, from T-Mobile saying Verizon’s 5G isn't much faster than [its] 4G. Isn’t that great? The only commonality you can say is 5G, the next generation of mobile wireless. What it looks like is anyone's guess. It's likely to be only an enterprise service, for smart cars, GPS, analytics… that kind of thing. The question is if it will even benefit the ordinary consumer. I don’t know if there is a race, but 5G is coming in one shape or form. Whether we have to ""win"" the race is a dubious proposition either way. It’s often better to be the second mover and learn from [the first company's] mistakes. So far, there isn’t a standard for 5G service, and if you ask honest executives what they think it should be they’ll say they don't know. For sure it’s not coming to rural America. It’s too expensive and companies don't have the spectrum. A lot of rural communities still run on 3G and 2G.  RELATED: FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel: “When the FCC repealed its net neutrality protections it gave a green light to broadband providers to muck around with their customer’s internet experience.  So what is your vision for broadband connectivity?  My first dream is for everyone to have broadband. My more realistic dream is ... every community that wants to build its own network will be able to. In 19 states they’re prohibited. Right now, open access is the rage, which I’m in favor of.  Open access is when a community or municipality forms a partnership with a private company to build broadband infrastructure. Typically, the public will build a middle mile network, or service to the majority of the population, and the corporate partner will build last mile service. It’s cropping up all over the country.  My other dream is for everyone to have access to multiple providers. In Utah, they have 10 providers. That won’t happen in every city but it can in places with open access networks. Unfortunately, I don't see big cities getting open networks. Republicans say that having more than one option is overbuilding. To me, that is competition. One provider means people are paying more. Further, low-income, rural citizens or residents pay more than higher-income people because no one wants to serve those areas.  Where is the role for federal funding to expand rural infrastructure?  The government is giving millions to monopoly networks, which are using the money not on CapEx (capital expenditure, such as building plants, property and equipment) but on OpEx (operating expenses). The FCC just granted $24 billion to ISPs. I would like to see the plan that demonstrates where and what is actually getting built.  There’s a lot of evidence that suggests the FCC’s methodology for mapping connectivity is flawed. If I understand, the FCC relies on reports from service providers themselves to show that an area has broadband, and they often plaster over hard-to-reach areas while still accepting government funding. Why is this allowed to happen?  Because the FCC allows them to. It was different when I was there, but I admit it’s one thing we didn't fix. We were doing repairs on problems our predecessors caused. The issue is simple – that ISPs say if one person in a community has access, then everyone has connectivity, even if they don’t. And so is the solution – actually providing service where you say you provide service. But a new mapping program won't be ready for another two years. At that point, a quarter of the $24 billion stimulus will go out under the old mapping procedure. That means the funds will go to areas that are unserved, while underserved areas that are mapped as served won’t get a chance at the money.  You mentioned your predecessor. It seems like today there are two faces of the FCC, either non-elected federal officials are for the people or for enterprise. Was that the case during the previous administration?  Some issues are divided along partisan lines. Republicans never liked net neutrality. Though among the American people, regardless of party affiliation, there is support for Title Two net neutrality. And no one likes their cable provider. Since the repeal of net neutrality, every single one of the big companies have raised their prices. No love lost for ISPs among the American people. But ISPs are also very generous givers of campaign contributions…  What is the pathway to restoring net neutrality?  There are several ways. In fact, there's a case winding through the courts now, which seems unlikely to win. Or if a Democrat is re-elected, I have no doubt Title Two will be reinstated. The best way is for Congress to pass a law to reinstate 2015 open internet order.  It’s that simple?  Yes. In 2017, Chairman Pai’s FCC repealed net neutrality. In 2018 the Senate reversed that ruling, meaning that Congress, with a simple majority, can reverse the agency’s action. bipartisan. The House did not. The House gets a bill this year to reinstate the 2015 open internet order. So both houses need to [pass the measure during] the same [congressional sesssion]. [Senate Majority Leader Mitch] McConnell is not taking the House bill. Last time around, Republicans voted to overturn the FCC's repeal.  What are the actual effects of the repeal of net neutrality? Have the much anticipated ""Internet Superhighways"" formed?  To the extent that the main argument for the repeal was that ISPs will investment more, that hasn’t happened. But the conversation was always more than just the possibility of providers blocking and throttling searches. The repeal also raises questions about the industry’s ability to wantonly raise prices, and track and sell consumer data. Making sure these companies don't engage in fraudulent billing practices was a core component of Title Two. I don’t see a way that repealing oversight of a duopoly is good for the American people.  Are there any [presidential] candidates that you think have a solid plan regarding connectivity?  I think every single Democratic candidate will put in place an FCC chair who will restore Title Two. Both [Bernie] Sanders and [Elizabeth] Warren have comprehensive broadband plans. The others do not. [Senators] Sanders and Warren can call for billions in investment, but Congress still has to pass the bill. There’s only so much a President can do. Three good Democrats need to walk in lockstep. That’s why this Trump presidency is doing well. We need an FCC commission that won't kowtow to the industry.  Former Vice President Joe Biden wants to repeal Section 230, the law that protects internet companies from liability for the content they distribute. Are you for or against repealing it?  Repealing it would be a disaster for small companies, not big companies, and lead to platforms not moderating content at all. I've been working on an independent standards and practices body where if a platform is in compliance, it would give them the presumption of immunity. You get an extra boost under 230 if you comply. It's an early formulation of an idea. Getting rid of 230 hurts small companies and everything being a cesspool. People want to commit platforms to moderation, but everyone has different standards for what's acceptable. An independent body would set the standards for the industry. Hang 230 protection on that. What we have now is not perfect. Allowing the status quo is a terrible idea, repeal 230 is a terrible idea, having a government censor is a terrible idea. Nothing I've heard so far appeals to me.  Do we need a new federal privacy law?  There should be a consumer privacy bill. Why aren't basic there protections for privacy across the economy, not just telecommunications? It’s not just about giving consumers choice about what they want to share, but protecting people against massive data breaches, which happen to hotel chains' credit cards, not just FaceBook and Google. We don't because there is a fight over whether it’s a state or federal issue, and whether individuals should have a private line of action. Folks ought to think about giving the FCC more resources for consumer privacy issues. We should create – like every European country – a data protection authority tasked with protecting consumer privacy. I’m stunned we do not have a consensus here, the Democrats and Republicans are not too far apart. It’s too big an issue to leave to the feds alone. If we end up with just the state or private line of action. It's gotta be the feds-plus.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/02/21/the-internet-is-a-right-not-a-luxury-30-of-americans-still-dont-have-it,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ba61be6bd6dd370904351331d228722e825f4eb3-1280x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383328,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vDQ1,1582299853,FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel: Restore Net Neutrality and Expand Internet to All,"There are two warring factions at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).      One side represents the business class, or the dominant internet service providers (ISPs) that want less regulation, freer markets and the ability to determine how to run and where to build their networks. Its apotheosis is found in the current FCC chairman, Ajit Pai.      The competing side, represented by Jessica Rosenworcel, one of the five FCC commissioners, is fighting for the interests of consumers. Its cornerstone positions are the restoration of net neutrality and the expansion of broadband access for all those who want it.      To some extent, the opposing interests fall neatly along party lines. Republicans want to defang the FCC while Democrats want to leverage it to expand and improve broadband in the county.      “It’s only in Washington, where there are high-paid lobbyists on behalf of broadband, that this is a controversial point,” Gigi Sohn, a former FCC chair and current NGO operator at the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Open Markets Institute, said in a phone call. However, in the current U.S. election cycle, that isn’t the obvious case.      President Donald Trump ran on a position to expand rural internet connectivity, part of his pledge to fight on behalf of Ronald Reagan’s silent majority. He hasn’t delivered, but it’s a call to action also picked up by presidential contenders and U.S. senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, who between them have proposed $235 billion to build broadband networks.      Partisan lines are seemingly blurry inside the FCC, as well. The agency passed a $20.4 billion subsidy (about $10 billion less than candidate Warren offered) to construct broadband networks in unserved parts of the U.S. over the next decade. From the start, registered Democrat Jessica Rosenworcel opposed the bill.      The funds would be directed using outdated maps. “It’s time to think bigger and bolder. It’s time to do so informed by good data,” Rosenworcel wrote in a partially assenting and dissenting statement.      This sense of rational urgency is displayed in much of Rosenworcel’s activity as a broadband advocate. CoinDesk caught up with the commissioner to determine where she stands on 21st century communications technologies.    On net neutrality    “When the FCC repealed its net neutrality protections it gave a green light to broadband providers to muck around with their customers' internet experience. I dissented because I didn’t think that was a good idea. Nor did the majority of Americans. That’s because most Americans do not have a choice when it comes to their broadband provider. So, if their providers start to block their traffic or throttle their content, [consumers] have no place to turn. They’re out of luck. While the FCC’s decision is still winding its way through the courts, we have already seen some research that suggests carriers may be selectively throttling video content. But because of the FCC’s net neutrality rollback, no one is taking a closer look to see what’s going on. That’s regrettable. Similarly, first responders also had no place to turn when they found that their service was being throttled in the midst of wildfire response in California. That’s unfortunate. It demonstrates that the FCC’s abdication of its authority to protect consumers in the internet age deserves a serious re-think.”      On broadband deployment    “The FCC is the nation’s communications policy authority, so it’s embarrassing that it lacks a fully accurate picture of where broadband is and is not across the country. Right now we’re operating off an official data set that assumes if there is a single subscriber anywhere in a census block broadband is available throughout. This is just not right. This methodology masks millions of households and businesses that are unserved and erroneously suggests our broadband efforts are almost done. So many people in so many places are stuck in broadband deserts across the country. It’s time to fix the method we use for calculating who is served and then we need to build accurate maps that reflect where to deploy the billions we have to boost deployment in areas stuck on the wrong side of the digital divide. When we do this, we need to do more than just sit in Washington and work with the data. We need to actively engage the public by asking them to participate in the process, challenge what we have right and wrong, and incorporate the power of crowdsourcing. I think this is the right way forward. Unfortunately, this is not how the agency is proceeding right now. We have plans to fix our data and maps at some unknown point in the future. But in the interim we’ll be sending out billions of dollars to expand broadband without have a full grasp on just where it should go. This is backwards.”     On Internet of Things    “The Internet of Things is headed our way in full force. We are soon going to have billions and billions of devices that will connect so much in the world around us. When powered by 5G wireless services, we will have unprecedented opportunity to use these super-fast connections to make our lives more efficient and effective. But as our connections multiply, so do our cyber vulnerabilities. So, here’s an idea: We should incorporate good cyber hygiene practices into the FCC’s equipment authorization process. It would work like this — Every device that emits radio frequency at some point passes through the FCC. It gets an identification number from the agency. It’s a stamp of approval that means the device complies with FCC rules and policy objectives before it is marketed or imported into the United States. The FCC could update this process to encourage device manufacturers to build security in from the start, by incorporating work underway at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which is developing a draft set of security recommendations for devices in the Internet of Things.”    On 5G    “The hype machine surrounding 5G is in full swing. The big chatter is everywhere — not just in the advertisements we all see, but in policy discussions in Washington, too. There is more than a kernel of truth in this rhetorical excess. That’s because the next generation of essential infrastructure in this country will be built incorporating wireless technology. Connectivity will be all around us, not just in our phones. Moreover, the connections will be lightning fast and feature extraordinarily low latency, opening up a range of new applications and services. As a result, the next iteration of wireless service is going to be a force across our economy and civic life. To facilitate this, the FCC has been working on making available the radio frequency required for wireless deployment. But the United States has made some early errors. Its early 5G spectrum focus has been on bringing to market high-band spectrum known as millimeter wave. In fact, the last five spectrum bands the agency has auctioned for commercial use have all been millimeter wave. The United States is alone in this course around the world. While these airwaves have significant capacity they do not propagate far. As a result, deploying the terrestrial equipment to make them viable nationwide is really expensive. Nearly all other nations have focused their early 5G efforts on mid-band airwaves, which have a better mix of capacity and coverage. The FCC has been slow to make this a priority and is only doing so now. It shouldn’t have taken this long. As a result, by most measures we are behind.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/02/21/fcc-commissioner-jessica-rosenworcel-restore-net-neutrality-and-expand-internet-to-all,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b7a1d2e7f9c715bba373f728137bb10a181f8fe8-1187x1187.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383326,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vDOl,1582298466,'Bullish' Comments on Reddit a Potential Bitcoin Signal,"In the never-ending search for signals to give traders an edge, could bullish comments on Reddit serve as a momentum indicator for bitcoin? That’s what a recent graphic by startup ChartStar suggests.       The data visualization company graphed comment data over the past several weeks for the term “bullish” from several popular cryptocurrency Reddit channels (“subreddits”), each with varying degrees of moderation. One thing these subreddits have in common is that discussion about trading is clearly allowed. Also, each comment entry was tallied only once; posting “bullish bullish bullish” would count as just one comment.       Against the bullish mentions, ChartStar graphed the weekly close price of bitcoin (BTC).       Sure enough, positive comments seem to track nicely with bitcoin prices in the early weeks of 2020 — but up to a point. After a sudden surge for the term “bullish” on the seventh week of the year, bitcoin prices declined.       ChartStar is pitching itself as a new type of TradingView, the popular charting tool for stocks, commodities, etc. TradingView does support cryptocurrencies, but ChartStar’s position is that cryptocurrency traders need new tools to execute winning strategies.       This is a bit reminiscent of a technical analysis tool known as the stochastic oscillator. A momentum indicator, it compares an asset’s price to recent price range, with traders able to set variables such as time period. This tool is used to give traders a sense of whether an asset is heading toward a downtrend (“overbought”) or an uptrend (“oversold”).      ""There is a surge in optimism outpacing the trend, followed by a fall in price. This could indicate that excess optimism is a sign of the asset being overbought and is a potential warning a correction is due,"" said David Gilbert of ChartStar.       Yet, the jury is still out as to whether Reddit activity could act as a stochastic oscillator for bitcoin. After all, it could be that the bullish comments are posted after short-term rallies, not before. That’s because ChartStar posted week-average totals, and rallies early in a week could get commenters chattering about it for a few days.       Traders are always looking for indicators to make decisions. Something that could combine technical analysis, using tools like stochastic oscillators, and fundamental analysis, looking at expressed sentiment, would be ideal.

Shopify said in its blog post it intends to ""work collectively"" to build a payment network that works ""everywhere.""      Libra was unveiled by Facebook last summer as a global payments project, with a stablecoin backed by a basket of fiat currencies. The Libra Association, a governing council for the project, was founded in October, decentralizing leadership of the stablecoin on paper. Facebook itself is not on the council, though its subsidiary Calibra is.      Other members include Coinbase, Xapo, Anchorage, Bison Trails, Creative Destruction Lab, Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive Capital, Ribbit Capital, Union Square Ventures, Illiad, Farfetch, Uber, Lyft, Kiva, Mercy Corps, Women’s World Banking, Spotify, PayU and Mark Zuckerberg's Breakthrough Initiatives.      Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, Booking Holdings, eBay, Stripe and Mercado Pago were originally meant to be part of the project but withdrew before the council was formed. Vodafone remained a member until January.      ""Our mission has always been to support the entrepreneurial journey of the more than one million merchants on our platform. That means advocating for transparent fees and easy access to capital, and ensuring the security and privacy of our merchants’ customer data. We want to create an infrastructure that empowers more entrepreneurs around the world,"" Shopify's blog post said.      The blog post said a large part of the world's existing financial infrastructure was not built to scale sufficiently for the needs of internet commerce.      In a statement, Libra Association head of policy and communications Dante Disparte said the group was ""proud"" to welcome its new, and now 21st member.      ""As a multinational commerce platform with over one million businesses in approximately 175 countries, Shopify, Inc., brings a wealth of knowledge and expertise to the Libra project. Shopify joins an active group of Libra Association members committed to achieving a safe, transparent, and consumer-friendly implementation of a global payment system that breaks down financial barriers for billions of people,"" he said.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/02/21/e-commerce-giant-shopify-joins-libra-association,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/56609623c7e5c7ead45cff3aa5d5276ca01700cf-2560x1903.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383321,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vDIT,1582296653,Binance and Others Are Rushing to Provide Stablecoins to Nigerian Crypto Users,"The Nigerian cryptocurrency market may be on the verge of a local bull run, thanks to newly popularized avenues to the global market.      Emmanuel Babalola, Binance’s business manager in Nigeria, said he’s seen a 50 percent increase in signups so far in 2020, leading to “thousands” of new Binance users in Nigeria. Roughly 300 people signed up for a corresponding “masterclass” in Benin in January, teaching users how to set up their own personal wallets and experiment with margin-trading strategies. There was so much demand for the six-hour class that Babalola will run three more classes over the next four weeks and offer two a month going forward.      If various big-name crypto projects vying to serve the developing world are looking for inspiration, look no further than this West African nation of 190 million. There’s rampant demand in Nigeria, where the World Bank estimates 35 million unbanked adults have a mobile phone. The vast majority of these unbanked users are women.      “The majority of users in Nigeria use Binance mobile on their phones,” he said, adding there are roughly 4,000 traders in Binance’s Nigerian Telegram group. “By the end of this month, we’ll have a fiat on-ramp on the mobile app as well.”      Although Binance was one of the first global exchanges to launch a fiat-on-ramp in Nigeria, a market largely dominated by peer-to-peer exchanges like LocalBitcoins and Paxful, Binance isn’t the only game in town. The local exchange BuyCoins, launched in the aftermath of 2017’s bull run also has a comparable fiat-on-ramp. On BuyCoins, Nigerians can buy cryprocurrency using their Naira-denominated debit cards or bank transfers. Lasebikan’s team created $50,000 worth of the ethereum-based stablecoin Naira, backed one-to-one in the bank, and distributed it through the local over-the-counter (OTC) traders’ association, Alpha Training Lab.      “In our country, there’s a lot of bitcoin trading that happens offline,” said BuyCoins co-founder Tomiwa Lasebikan. “People who trade a lot on WhatsApp groups. … No one in the country can accurately estimate how much [trading] activity there is.”      Lasebikan said the exchange now handles roughly $5 million in monthly volume, predominantly in bitcoin trading. The modest infusion of stablecoins into the market served as an indirect on-ramp to the platform.    Follow-on investment    The modest Naira effort garnered such clear results that now DeFi leader MakerDAO is trying a similar approach to encourage local adoption.      The ethereum-centric stablecoin project gave a $15,000 grant to the internet service provider Althea to offer connectivity in exchange for DAI stablecoins in Abuja, Nigeria’s capital city. So far there are 16 households participating and operating nodes, according to Althea co-founder Deborah Simpier, paying the startup around $15 worth of crypto a month for WiFi. She said they’ll be expanding to Lagos, Nigeria’s largest city, next month and encouraging initial node operators to provide WiFi to local mobile subscribers, generating their own crypto income.      Binance’s Babalola said he’s heard of, and is optimistic about, such stablecoins, although his own team is focused on the exchange’s native stablecoin, BUSD. Stablecoins can be particularly attractive for traders who want to transact, for example, with undocumented youth who can’t get a formal exchange account.      “Less than half of Nigerians have government-issued ID cards,” Babalola said. “Most crypto users in Nigeria are young people in schools.”      All things considered, 2020 will see a wider variety of onboarding options than ever before. In addition to a few incumbent African exchanges from pre-2017, like Luno, there are now several exchanges focused on connecting Nigerians to the global cryptocurrency market.      “We have agents on the ground going door to door, talking about crypto and the potential it holds,” Babalola said.

The Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) said blockchain has ""great potential"" as the basis of a system that would use a combination of encryption, hash signatures and watermarking in an image's metadata to protect copyright, Digital Trends reported Thursday.      The system could have advantages over existing verification models, JPEG said at a recent meeting in Sydney, Australia. Instead of signing up for a particular program, blockchain means content creators and end-users can simply reference the metadata built into images themselves.      JPEG is a joint committee, formed from various technical standardization authorities around the world that created and now maintains the popular image format of the same name.      At the meeting, the group also discussed whether blockchain, and possibly smart contracts, could be used in media forensics as well as to better protect user privacy and security.      Social media networks, such as Facebook, could even use their proposed blockchain system to flag stolen and faked photos uploaded to their platforms, JPEG suggested.      The idea of using blockchain technology to verify images is not new. Photography company Kodak, as one example, licensed a third party to create a DLT-based system in early 2018 to incentivize users to report fakes and copyright violations in return for a ""KodakCoin"" cryptocurrency.

42383315,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vD8P,1582291800,The Domain Startups Building an Uncensorable Internet on Top of Ethereum,"Ethereum developers are leveraging blockchain’s censorship-resistant nature to launch the next iteration of the internet, Web 3.0.      Last weekend at ETHDenver – one of the conference circuit’s top gatherings of ethereum coders – decentralized internet alternatives were on display, including Ethereum Name Service (ENS), Unstoppable Domains and UniLogin.      Launched in 2017 and 2018, respectively, ENS and Unstoppable Domains are confronting the hierarchical nature of the internet stack and the Domain Name System (DNS) by building out a peer-to-peer (P2P) internet alternative. Meanwhile, UniLogin provides a portal to Web 3.0 projects such as ENS.      The current internet architecture is controlled by select bodies including non-profit groups, businesses, universities and world governments. Buying, naming and controlling a domain is dependent on the good will of hosting providers, said the teams.      Perhaps the best example of the perils of this dynamic is the controversial planned sale of the .org domain to a private equity firm.      Using the ethereum blockchain, this new crop of startups is helping developers get decentralized websites onto the internet without the approval of DNS authorities.    Unstoppable Domains    Unstoppable Domains announced the launch of its own browser, complete with a new top-level domain name: .crypto.      Built on ethereum, Unstoppable Domains co-founder Brad Kam told CoinDesk the product is purpose-built to protect free speech online.      Domains linked to .crypto addresses can not be taken offline by a third party, Kam said. Recent populist uprisings in Spain and Turkey, which were heavily censored online by each government, were unique motivators, he said.      “Censorship is happening. For example, the .cat registry, which was supporting Catalonian independence, was raided by the Spanish police,” Kam said. “They arrested the founders and they took down a bunch of websites, all to stop them from running independence votes.”      In Turkey, all web hosting providers received a list of 150 banned words that cannot be hosted anywhere in the country. One of them is “naked.” Another one of them is “gay.”      “With decentralized hosting, we focus on replacing the current internet,” Kam said in an interview.      Kam said most people see Web 3.0 products as competitors against one another, a flawed viewpoint. The goal remains cutting out incumbent systems like DNS, Kam said.      “Any existing attempts in the blockchain world are tiny, ourselves included,” he said. “The competition is .com.”    Ethereum Name Service    While Unstoppable Domains has built out a domain registry and browser, ENS has focused on the former with its increasingly popular .eth top-level domain.      “Our ambition is that ENS, long term, upgrades the tech stack of the domain name system of the internet,” said ENS Director of Operations Brantly Millegan. “Practically, it means that you can have a name that you own, that has all the decentralization and censorship-resistance and programmability of ethereum.”      Millegan said ENS is compatible with certain browsers such as Opera and has over 100 applications and APIs integrated. As an ethereum smart contract, Millegan said .eth domains are dependent on the ethereum network and not web hosting partners.      For now, the main use-case remains connecting domains with cryptocurrency wallets, although this feature remains controversial. Originally intended to make crypto addresses similar to email, a recent report by Decrypt showed how ENS domain names could be used to gather personal information such as business deals or people’s locations.",POSITIVE,ETH | ENS,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | ENS,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/02/21/the-domain-startups-building-an-uncensorable-internet-on-top-of-ethereum,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d326cbc5d7e9b714f6deec6d0e53f894cd5918c3-1116x716.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA) issued a statement Friday denying it has ever regulated Binance or that the exchange has ever had leave to operate in the island nation's fledgling cryptocurrency industry.      Citing reports in the media that referred to Binance as a ""Malta-based cryptocurrency company,"" the regulator announced Binance ""is not authorized by the MFSA to operate in the cryptocurrency sphere and is therefore not subject to regulatory oversight by the MFSA.""      Binance announced it was opening an office in Malta in March 2018 soon after it clashed with regulators in Japan, where the exchange had previously attempted to establish a presence. At the time, Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat welcomed the exchange to the country, tweeting the island nation would support Binance's goal to become the ""global trailblazers in the regulation of blockchain-based businesses.”      In September 2018, the exchange also said it would work with the Malta Stock Exchange (MSX) to begin offer security token trading. Another announcement in late 2019 said it was providing funding for a new crypto-friendly Maltese bank.      It isn't clear if Binance still has an office in Malta.      While Binance declined to comment prior to publication, CEO Changpeng Zhao later tweeted that ""this is old news & has always been the case.""      Press releases sent to CoinDesk by Binance listed Malta in the dateline as recently as Feb. 11, 2020, though the exchange doesn't appear to have officially stated where its headquarters is located.      ""As we run such a decentralized operation, there isn't a clear answer for that – where we operate regulated businesses (e.g. Binance Singapore, Binance U.S. etc), we have teams based there,"" Josh Goodbody, Binance's director for growth and institutional business, previously said.      The MFSA did say in Friday's announcement it was currently ""assessing if Binance has any activities in Malta which may not fall within the realm of regulatory oversight."" The regulator also reiterated that following the passing of the Virtual Financial Assets Act of 2018, Maltese businesses that either traded or offered cryptocurrencies had to be fully licensed.

42383325,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vDKz,1582283700,Bitcoin Chart Indicator Flips Bearish as Price Sees Weak Bounce From $9.4K,"View  Bitcoin's (BTC) daily money flow index has turned bearish, supporting the case for a deeper price pullback put forward by Wednesday's bearish engulfing candle.  On the downside, support is seen at $9,400, a level that restricted downside in the previous two days. A violation there would expose the higher low created at $9,074 on Feb. 4.  A move back above a short-term moving average at $9,800 would weaken the bearish mood, while a bearish channel breakout on the four-hour chart is needed to put the bulls back into the driver's seat.    Bitcoin's lackluster recovery from price support around $9,400 is struggling to gather upside traction amid bearish developments on the short-term technical charts.      The top cryptocurrency by market value fell by 5.5 percent on Wednesday to register its biggest single-day drop in three months.      Sellers, however, failed to keep prices below the widely tracked 200-day moving average support on the four-hour chart (currently at $9,400). That level was defended again on Thursday.      So far, however, the repeated defense of that level has failed to yield a notable price bounce, leaving the cryptocurrency below the resistance of the five-day average at $9,750.      A significant recovery may remain elusive, as the daily chart's money flow index (MFI), a momentum indicator that incorporates both price and trading volumes, is suggesting increased selling pressure with a below-50 reading.      The MFI dropped below 50 on Thursday and is currently seen at 43.00, the lowest level since Jan. 2. As a result, the risks are skewed to the downside.      At press time, bitcoin is changing hands at $9,710 on Bitstamp and its global average price, as calculated by CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index, is seen at $9,721 – up 0.87 percent over 24 hours.    Daily and 4-hour charts    The MFI (above left) has found acceptance in bearish territory below 50, validating a major bearish engulfing candle created on Feb. 19. That candle also established a lower high (marked by arrow) at $10,300 – a sign of weakening bull momentum.      The five- and 10-day averages are trending south, also indicating a bearish setup. Notably, the cryptocurrency is struggling to penetrate the five-day average, as indicated by the upper wick attached to today's candle.      Further, bitcoin is trading within a descending bearish channel on the four-hour chart (above right). So, a deeper slide to $9,075 (Feb. 4 low) cannot be ruled out.      A sustained break above the five-day average at $9,755 would neutralize the bearish bias. That said, the market would only turn bullish if prices manage to exit the falling channel on the back of strong volumes. In that case, the recent high of $10,500 would likely be put to test.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/02/21/bitcoin-chart-indicator-flips-bearish-as-price-sees-weak-bounce-from-94k,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1fc9602717161957ba2e28b3b3c1de1ed5c16823-761x416.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383323,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vDHD,1582282339,New Settlement Layer to Offer Asian Crypto Institutions Local Alternative to Silvergate Bank,"Legacy Trust's digital asset division plans to create the first settlement layer in Asia for institutional investors trading both fiat and cryptocurrencies.      First Digital Trust (FDT) announced Friday its new rapid settlement and clearing network (RSCN) will provide custodian clients, including some of Asia's most prominent over-the-counter desks and financial institutions, with the means to transfer digital assets seamlessly across the region.      Based in Hong Kong, FDT also holds its clients' funds there because the territory's regulatory framework allows it to offer a custodial solution for both cryptocurrencies and fiat, making it possible for institutions to perform secure trades between the two asset classes.      ""There isn't a similar service anywhere in Asia,"" said FTD COO Gunnar Jaerv, who added it was high time the region had a settlement solution of its own.      Asian trading constitutes a largepercentage of total cryptocurrency trading volumes. But most of the region's institutional investors use the Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN), the settlement layer from California-based Silvergate Bank – one of the few regulated financial institutions to take clients that trade cryptocurrencies.      SEN is popular with traders. The settlement layer, which allows users to move USD between cryptocurrency exchanges, processed a record of more than 14,000 transactions in Q4 2019, an increase in 17 percent from the previous quarter.      But Jaerv said it compelled its clients in Asia to follow strict U.S. financial regulation, even if the trades would not otherwise involve American entities. He added that it seemed pointless for a region, home to some of the largest OTC desks in the world, like OSL, should take the ""scenic route"" by processing payments with a U.S.-domiciled institution.      ""If they're trading with a U.S. counterparty then it might make more sense for them to use Silvergate exchange network, but if they're trading with somebody in Japan, Korea or Hong Kong ... it definitely makes more sense to use a local provider,"" Jaerv said.      Whereas Silvergate can only support U.S. dollars, any freely tradable currency, including the Singapore and Hong Kong dollars as well as euros, sterling and the greenback, can be used on FDT's RSCN. That gives clients a broader range of fiat exchange rates as well as more diverse options for purchasing cryptocurrencies, Jaerv said.      FDT, which was spun out of Legacy Trust in September, said the RSCN was currently in the testing phase, but a full launch is slated for sometime in May. The layer will initially be restricted to fiat and crypto assets but could be expanded to include other assets, like tokenized securities, sometime in the future, Jaerv indicated.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/02/21/new-settlement-layer-to-offer-asian-crypto-institutions-local-alternative-to-silvergate-bank,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f7ec0036227d576b700ce6712e31326b6c0b3610-1500x934.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383333,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vDSX,1582280056,Insolvent Exchange FCoin Had Bitcoin Outflow Problems Just Two Months After Launch: Report,"Cryptocurrency exchange FCoin, which revealed its insolvency this week, may have already been leaking bitcoin as early as July 2018 – just two months after its debut.      On-chain analysis and security startup PeckShield released a report on Friday, suggesting FCoin's bitcoin (BTC) wallets had a significant outflow of nearly 10,000 BTC between July 19 and Aug. 31, 2018 – a time that coincided with the occurrence of the fatal ""data error"" that FCoin founder Zhang Jian mentioned in his tell-all post on Feb. 17.      While announcing FCoin was insolvent, the founder revealed the exchange had a shortfall of up to $130 million worth of bitcoin.      Basing its on-chain analysis on the address of one of FCoin's major bitcoin cold wallets, starting with ""12rU7w"" and disclosed in June 2018, PeckShield said it had collected 33,938 bitcoin addresses that are believed to belong to FCoin – including hot, cold and users' custodian wallets – and compiled the combined daily balance of these wallets from April 2018 to February 2020.      The chart shows FCoin's wallets surged to as many as 13,272 BTC on July 19, reflecting sharp growth after the debut of the exchange's ""trans-fee mining"" model in May. But the daily balance sharply decreased to just 3,759 BTC on Aug. 31, according to PeckShield.      Although the daily balance climbed back to 7,300 BTC around November 2018, it has since decreased to only about 477 bitcoin currently, PeckShield's analysis suggested.      ""Our initial guess is FCoin's cashflow problem may already have emerged in July 2018. The Pandora's box may have been opened at that time at the peak of its momentum,"" the firm said in the post.    Missing millions    It's unclear where all these bitcoin went exactly, but at least about 3,500 of them were sent from FCoin to wallets at other nine crypto exchanges. Each of the series of transactions was a round number of 100, 150, or 200 BTC. The recipient exchanges included Huobi, OKEx, Binance, Coinbase and Bitfinex.      According to PeckShield's analysis, FCoin's the 12rU7w cold wallet address has cumulatively sent 8,009 and 11,107 BTC to sub-addresses that start with 19xHiA and 1PFtrR, respectively. These two sub-addresses further initiated transactions, of which 3,500 BTC ended up at wallets at other exchanges.      While it's unclear if those wallets belong to respective exchanges or merely FCoin's custodian wallets at those exchanges, PeckShield said those transactions – sent in round numbers of 100 or 150 BTC – were unlikely to be FCoin users' withdrawal requests, which would otherwise be in random amounts.      FCoin, which adopted its novel and controversial trans-fee mining model in May 2018, said in a post earlier this week its digital asset reserve has a bitcoin shortfall of 7,000 to 13,000 and thus can no longer process users' withdrawal requests.      FCoin's Jian claimed in his post the issue was due to a ""data error"" in the exchange's systems that began in mid 2018, crediting users with more assets than they should have received.      Without a proper auditing system, FCoin allowed these users to convert assets they shouldn't have into real assets and subsequently to withdraw those assets from the exchange.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | MINING | BNB,Wolfie Zhao,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/02/21/insolvent-exchange-fcoin-had-bitcoin-outflow-problems-just-two-months-after-launch-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0b805b4e1a382df3a9dbc4656c69e721bb9b145b-1000x706.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In an announcement on Thursday, the company said it is considering opportunities to divest itself of the limited assets associated with the exchange, launched in early 2018, due to the regulatory environment, security risks and competition from peers.      “In order to concentrate its focus on cryptocurrency mining, Riot has opted to sunset further development of Riot's U.S.-based digital currency exchange,” the company said in a statement.      Riot has hired Chicago-based investment bank XMS Capital Partners to advise on potential strategic deals and the search for new growth opportunities.      The announcement came on the heels of Colorado-based Riot’s mining expansion in Oklahoma City. Riot installed an additional 1,060 Antminer S17 Pro devices from Bitmain on Feb. 11.      Previously, the company deployed 3,000 of the same AntmMiner model in January, having announced in December it would purchase 4,000 of the mining machines from Bitmain for $6.35 million. The firm expects to boost its bitcoin computing power by 240 percent with the latest additions.      While it dedicates hashing power to a variety of cryptocurrencies including bitcoin (BTC), bitcoin cash (BCH) and litecoin (LTC), Riot will sharpen its focus on bitcoin mining in the future, the company said.      Riot’s stock was trading at $1.42, down 5.33 percent, as of the Thursday market close after announcing the increased focus on bitcoin mining, according to data from Yahoo Finance.      Riot was originally a biotechnology company and it pivoted to blockchain in October 2017. The company changed its name from Bioptix to Riot Blockchain. During the transition, it had considered business opportunities in banking, cryptocurrency trading and digital wallets.      The firm's expansion comes before bitcoin's supply-cutting ""halving"" event in May 2020 – a programmed in reduction in the rewards given to miners that is expected by many (but not all) to bring a boost to the price of the cryptocurrency.",NEUTRAL,BCH,BCH | BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MINING | TRADING,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/02/21/riot-blockchain-plans-sale-of-crypto-exchange-as-it-invests-more-millions-in-bitcoin-mining,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/acd5d6c9ad1958f05126537cc9de7e3d77c7ee42-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
