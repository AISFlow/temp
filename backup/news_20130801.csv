42376600,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6W3AR,1375369320,"Sweet success for Bees Brothers, world's youngest bitcoin entrepreneurs","Most teenage boys are far too busy at school and interested in playing sports and computer games to set up a business on the side. But nestled between two mountain ranges in northern Utah, USA, there are three brothers who are possibly the youngest bitcoin entrepreneurs out there.  At 14, 13 and 10 years old, Nate, Sam and Ben Huntzinger have their own successful honey business at home in the Cache Valley. It all began when they caught a swarm of bees as a bit of a fun experiment. Little did they know it would lead to a small business and an obsession with bitcoin.  The boys have had their own bee nests since they were old enough to walk and as soon as they could fit into the beekeeping suits, at around six-years-old, they each started working with honeybees.  Their father, Craig, says they had no intention of starting a business. “As we started working with honey and beeswax we started making new things for ourselves, and eventually got a small business licence, more honeybee hives and started selling our items at our local Farmer’s Market,” he says.  They heard about bitcoin in 2011 and were instantly attracted by the concept of a decentralised, non-inflationary currency. The ideals behind bitcoin seem to align with those of the Huntzinger family. The three brothers are home-schooled as their father admits they have a different view of education. “We don’t believe that government has a monopoly on education, nor that the only way to learn is being forced to sit at a desk all day and stare at a book… The whole purpose of getting that first hive, and later the business licence, was all about education. What would happen if we did this…?”  The answer is a flourishing business and three boys learning about finance and investing before they have even finished high school. Business is booming. From selling pots of their honey locally, their company, Bees Brothers now produces several different flavours of honey caramels, honey roasted almonds, beeswax lip balms and candles both at the markets and via their website.  It is through their online sales, that they have had the most success with bitcoin transactions, taking advantage of the absence of international currency exchange costs. By January 2012, they were selling their first products for bitcoin and now ship orders all over the world: from California and New York in the US to many European countries and as far afield as Russia and Australia. They say they have many repeat customers and a lot of positive feedback from the bitcoin community.        As a result of their market stall, interest in the digital currency is growing. Each week, other vendors come with new questions and if you were to ask one of the boys what they do mostly at the market, they would say they spend all day “teaching people about bees and bitcoins.”  It seems their involvement with bitcoin does not end there, however. The boys are now developing an interest in the method of generating bitcoins, cryptography and investing, stating that they “aren’t true bitcoiners unless we do a little mining.” They have been spending what spare time they have over the summer learning about the process.  It has sparked some curiosity among their friends who want to learn cryptography with them, but when asked about their friends’ reactions, they say, “most don’t really know about it or don’t really care.” Some family members have shown more interest, with both sets of grandparents and two uncles having bought bitcoins from them.  Unlike many of their peers, the brothers see the currency as an important part of their financial future and most of their savings are in bitcoin and silver. “They are growing up with a totally different world view than what their parents grew up with. Bitcoin, or some other decentralised future currency is here to stay. The more government bailouts and inflationary printing, the stronger the alternatives to fiat will become… being versed in alternative currencies is a must,” Mr Huntzinger says.  In fact, bitcoin has become such an integral part of their lives, their father adds, “When they think of money, bitcoin is just as relevant as precious metals or Federal Reserve notes, maybe more so.”  For now they are also playing at just being boys. Nate wants to learn more about computer programming, Sam is looking forward to his first elk hunt in the Wind River Range of Wyoming and Ben; he wants to finish his tree house and live out there.  Although growing the Bees Brothers business to a full time venture is not part of the plan right now, it is going towards future college fees and whatever they go on to study or do as a career, it is likely to involve bitcoin.  The cryptocurrency, so often viewed as a Generation Y phenomenon, is clearly already trickling through to Gen Z. If anyone was to look for signs it is here to stay, these brothers might be what they are after. As some of the currency’s youngest adopters, they are sure to become experts in both honey and bitcoin, and right now, it is a sweet combination.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Louise Goss,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/08/01/sweet-success-for-bees-brothers-worlds-youngest-bitcoin-entrepreneurs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/280536de036f251f5c8cb00a74f1afd884ec21d6-2048x1359.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376555,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6W2u5,1375363786,How to buy bitcoins in person at Buttonwood Satoshi Square and other meetups,"Bitcoin is intrinsically linked to the Internet. Therefore, it's rather counterintuitive that so many people opt to trade bitcoins face-to-face, out there in the real world. All around the world, there are meetups for enthusiasts and traders to get together, chat, and exchange currencies. Where can you find them and what can you expect?  Why should you trade for bitcoins in person?  Just as with online shopping, it's far more convenient to order something from home than to make a trip out to somewhere. However, here in the UK, the options to purchase bitcoins aren't always straight forward. For instance, buying through Mt. Gox involves an expensive transfer to its Japanese bank, and other US-based exchanges don't operate within the UK. Fortunately there is Bittylicious, which allows for fast transfers. However, there is a small premium to pay for the convenience.  The flip side of dealing online is that it's impersonal and there isn't always someone there to explain and educate. That's the value of meeting up with like-minded individuals. You might even be able to negotiate a better price for your bitcoin.  Where can you meet?  There are two places you should start your search for a meeting place: Localbitcoins and Meetup.com. Meetup.com currently shows 134 bitcoin related meetups, just six of which are in the UK and four of those are for altcurrencies (non-bitcoin digital currencies). There's a greater spread of people selling bitcoin in the UK and a concentration in London on Localbitcoins.  In the US, there are the well-known Buttonwood Satoshi Square meetups where enthusiasts get together in New York to talk about the bitcoin world and trade bitcoins and even attempt to sell ASICS. There are other Buttonwood meets in the US too, such as the San Francisco and Los Angeles meets.  However, as Bitcoin Magazine wrote, you need to take great care over your personal security when meeting up to trade bitcoins. There's the possibility of being mugged or scammed. You can protect yourself by attending an arranged meetup of enthusiasts and by having separate bitcoin wallets for spending and saving money.  A somewhat dubious aspect of real-life bitcoin meetups is people who are obtaining bitcoin for illicit purposes (e.g. purchasing Silk Road items). Realistically, if you sell bitcoin to someone, you have no idea what it will be spent on. However, the good thing about a meetup, as opposed to a one-to-one meet, is that you can spend time getting to know the people you're trading with, or at least get to know their names. Ultimately, this has to be one of those instances where ""trust your instincts"" is the best advice. You want to avoid being linked to illegal activities, but without being paranoid. After all, one of the benefits of bitcoin is that it isn't intimately linked to your identity.  How can you create your own meetup?  If you're interested in starting your own bitcoin (or other altcurrency) trade meet, you can follow some fairly easy steps. Firstly you'll need some bitcoin if you don't have any already. Currently, BTC-e.com seems to have the lowest trading average, but you'll need to set up an international bank transfer to fund your account. Fortunately, you can use an international bank wire transfer if any of the other payment methods don’t suit you.  The next step would be to find a venue, so either have a word with the proprietor of a venue or check your local area's laws regarding public gatherings if you want to get together in an open space.  Then, join Meetup.com and start a meeting. Once you have the date and venue published, you'll need to publicise the event. Use the Bitcoin forum and your social media accounts to make sure people turn up.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING,David Gilson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2013/08/01/how-to-buy-bitcoins-in-person-at-buttonwood-satoshi-square-and-other-meetups,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/747dd83d68f89d6b70e90ff44fc54ea33fb12e3b-2560x1441.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376579,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6W36f,1375358769,"Shakil Khan: Bitcoin can be ""money over IP"", but services must get more intuitive","Bitcoin has an opportunity to make financial transactions truly frictionless, said CoinDesk founder Shakil Khan this week – but companies need solid business plans to make it happen.  There is room for people to introduce efficiencies into the finance sector, said Khan, speaking at the Inside Bitcoins conference on Tuesday. “Why is it in 2013 I can send you an email, a voicemail, or text message, but if someone says ‘you owe me $10 for my pizza last week’ and I try to send it, the bank wants to charge me $27?” he asked. “You might get it next week but it isn't guaranteed. We have a banking system that's slower than it’s ever been.”  Bitcoin has the potential to be “an IP address for money,” he said, but bitcoin services must become more intuitive if mainstream adoption is to occur. “Try to buy $10 in bitcoins. It's easier to get on a plane and fly to Mt. Gox,” he joked, adding that some other bitcoin sites seemed to go out of their way to be difficult to use.  This ease of use will come, but the community needs pragmatic business models to get there, advised UK-born Khan, a tech investor who has advised companies including Spotify, Path, and Summly.  There is a lot of idealism in the bitcoin community, he added, which is vital for startups. But he added that some would-be bitcoin entrepreneurs also need a healthy dose of pragmatism. “We're investors that want to invest in solid business models,” he said, but added that he hears from entrepreneurs who still dream of using virtual currencies to bring down the banks.  “I tell them: ‘You do realise that the people you talk about bringing down are the same people you're expecting to fund you?’,” he said. “This divide needs some sort of education, and acceptance that this is the real world.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/08/01/shakil-khan-bitcoin-can-be-money-over-ip-but-services-must-get-more-intuitive,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9b9ea7ec78b5253ab0d42ea5bfb68c56e5f15039-2560x1438.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
