Investors in the space were also spooked after French auditor Mazars reportedly halted its proof of reserves reporting for cryptocurrency clients, citing lack of confidence in the reports it published so far. The firm earlier released reports for crypto exchanges Binance, Crypto.com and KuCoin . According to CNBC, Mazars' report for Binance is no longer available on the firm's website. Accounting firm Armanino is also reportedly ending its crypto audit practice . The company was recently named in a lawsuit as it failed to find irregularities at FTX.US during its audit last year. The crypto industry has been reeling since the FTX ( FTT-USD ) collapse, with investors reportedly pulling 91,363 bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) - amounting to ~$1.5B - from Binance, Kraken and Coinbase last month. The SEC and the CFTC each filed charges against FTX ( FTT-USD ) founder Sam Bankman-Fried, essentially providing a blueprint on how regulators can police offshore crypto exchanges . ""Though the FTX fallout may slow the growth of the crypto economy, it is unlikely to derail the path of evolution these new technologies offer. Just as the hedge fund industry survived Bernie Madoff and emerged stronger, the crypto industry is likely to enter a more professional and regulated phase,"" said SA contributor Franklin Templeton Investments . The global cryptocurrency market cap stands at $806.06B, down 4.7% over Thursday, according to CoinMarketCap . The Biden administration said Congress enact legislation to regulate the spot market for crypto assets that are not securities and recommended steps to ""address regulatory arbitrage"". U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Roger Marshall (R-KS) unveiled a bipartisan legislation Tuesday to combat money laundering and terrorist financing through digital assets. Billionaire venture capitalist David Rubenstein predicts U.S. lawmakers will take about a year to pass legislation after the FTX scandal .

42388359,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRETz5,1671228475,Crypto Markets Today: Co-Founder of OneCoin Pyramid Scheme Pleads Guilty; CoinDesk Market Index Drops,"One of the founders behind OneCoin, Karl Greenwood, pleaded guilty to federal charges on Friday after one of the largest financial scams of all time, according to the U.S. Department of Justice.  This article originally appeared in Crypto Markets Today, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  The purported cryptocurrency project was fraudulent from its 2014 beginnings, prosecutors said, with OneCoin – co-founded by Greenwood – setting up a pyramid scheme to market it to millions of people, generating as much as $4 billion in revenue. Greenwood, 45, who allegedly called the investors “idiots” in an internal message, pleaded guilty to wire fraud and conspiracy to launder money.  “Karl Sebastian Greenwood operated one of the largest international fraud schemes ever perpetrated,” said Damian Williams, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. “Greenwood and his co-conspirators, including fugitive Ruja Ignatova, conned unsuspecting victims out of billions of dollars, claiming that OneCoin would be the ‘Bitcoin killer.’”  Ignatova, known as the “CryptoQueen,” remains on the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) Most Wanted list as another founder of OneCoin, which was based in Bulgaria. The FBI is offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to her arrest.  Token Roundup  Bitcoin (BTC): The largest cryptocurrency by market value fell 3% over the past 24 hours, in sync with equity markets. Risky assets such as cryptocurrencies and stocks are still under pressure from the Federal Reserve’s warning this week that monetary policy might need to keep tightening – and stay tight – well into 2023. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite closed down 1%. The S&P 500 slid 1.1% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.9%.  Ether (ETH): The second-largest cryptocurrency followed BTC’s trajectory, dropping around 3.1% to $1,205.  Raydium (RAY): Solana-based decentralized exchange platform Raydium confirmed in a tweet on Friday that it had been the victim of an exploit. At press time, around $2 million worth of different cryptocurrencies was sitting in the account of an attacker that managed to maliciously withdraw user funds from Raydium exchange pools. The price of RAY decreased 8.96% in the past 24 hours.  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI): The benchmark index of 167 digital assets lost 3.3%. Prognosticators suggest 2023 will be the “Year of the Dapps.” There’s also speculation that it might be the “Year of the DAOs,” but the question is whether it will be the year they start following the law.  Crypto Market Analysis: Bitcoin Finishes Roller-Coaster Week Near Where It Started  By Glenn Williams Jr.  Anyone who ignored bitcoin over the last seven days would think that not much occurred, if looking at total price movement. Those paying attention might still be dizzy from the roller-coaster ride.  Optimism early in the week reversed, with bitcoin’s price settling in just below $17,000. On a relative basis, BTC’s seven-day performance against the U.S. dollar was third among the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Ether finished in the middle of the pack, declining 5% over the last seven days.  BTC’s chart doesn’t offer much by way of short-term optimism. Its Relative Strength Index (RSI) has fallen near 40, implying that BTC momentum is essentially neutral at the moment.  The Volume Profile Visible Range tool shows significant past trading activity and price agreement between $16,500 and $17,000. The combination of these factors sets the framework for BTC to trade flat, in lieu of a new catalyst.  Read the full technical take here.

42407225,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gUJrzK,1671223619,Web3 Needs Seamless Infrastructure to Drive Adoption,"We at Blockdaemon predict that the future of Web3 will be built on a foundation of seamless user experience: seamless use, seamless monetization and seamless governance. The success of any Web3 project is dependent on its ability to deliver this seamless experience to all users, including developers and enterprises within the blockchain space.  We believe that blockchain-based solutions are the future of digital infrastructure. In order for them to take off, however, we need to ensure that the user experience is of high quality. This means that both users and developers need an easy way to access Web3 infrastructure and apps built on top of it.  Friedrich ""Freddy"" Zwanzger is the Ethereum ecosystem lead at Blockdaemon, a leading independent blockchain infrastructure platform. This story is part of CoinDesk's Crypto 2023 outlook.  A year to prepare for the future  The work developers perform in 2023 will lay the foundation for the next wave of crypto adoption. This foundation will be based on the building blocks of cheap, modular, scalable and reliable blockchain infrastructure. The Ethereum protocol will serve as a manifest example to prove our point.  We predict that this critical infrastructure, developed next year and beyond, will onboard billions of new users and hundreds of institutions in the future.  However, this can only be achieved through great crypto products and use cases.  The strong market conditions we’ve seen play out between late 2020 and 2021 revealed this need for solid infrastructure to support such applications.  Unlike previous market cycles, 2021 saw large-scale institutional and developer adoption take place. Both financial institutions and decentralized application (dapp) creators needed a simple way to build on top of secure blockchain infrastructure.  Many of the companies who built during the bull market will now struggle during the market downturn. This is mainly due to not having positive cash flow combined with insufficient treasury management skills.  Well-thought-out, properly funded projects will survive and thrive during this crypto winter, while those that aren’t will struggle or fail.  The Ethereum protocol is by far the most revenue-generating blockchain network. The Merge from the energy-intensive proof-of-work to the significantly more efficient proof-of-stake laid important groundwork for the future and in turn achieved 0% inflation since September, when the Merge took place..  The importance of reliable blockchain infrastructure  Over the past 20 years infrastructure services have dramatically reshaped the way online businesses are built.  The dawn of cloud-based infrastructure radically reduced overheads for web companies. Consumers enjoyed faster, more responsive applications while developers could focus their time building innovative products.  While the need for reliable blockchain infrastructure has technically existed since the introduction of Bitcoin, it is only relatively recently that builders have had access to the tools needed to support the growth of this decentralized future.  Cloud infrastructure brought powerful benefits to the web. Blockchain follows the same deflationary route of other technologies, radically reducing costs associated with legacy systems. However, developing the killer apps of blockchain relies on the same high-quality infrastructure that Web2 enjoys.  Such infrastructure support is needed to meet the growing demand for dapps, spanning complex needs across a wide range of use cases.  However, projects in 2023 will need to focus and double down to set themselves up for later success, to meet these complex needs and use cases.  How crypto projects can prepare for future success in 2023  This coming year will be a tipping point for crypto projects that are looking to position themselves well for the next wave of crypto growth.  We predict that to excel under current market conditions, Web3 companies will need to focus on three core essentials:  1. Focus to find product market fit  Companies must tighten their product offerings in order to win. This concentrates scarce resources, both time and money, on key value-adding areas. It means knowing the market deeply and finding product market fit.  Many large-scale institutional investors seek to invest in companies that are product oriented. Web3 companies should focus on building products that create better, seamless experiences for their customers using blockchain.  Enabling withdrawals of staked ether (ETH) can be seen as such a feature and will be delivered to retail and institutional stakers alike around March 2023. It eliminates the previous capital lock-up on the Ethereum PoS network, thus eliminating the biggest point of friction.  2. Integrate for vertical strengths  True long-term value is created when a company is a vertical domain expert across one (or many) of the rising categories of the future.  A practical focus on product should fuse with a vision of what clients in the future will look for. By building value in these fertile fields, companies gain a powerful vantage point for the future. Being vertically integrated in key growth areas creates competitive moats.  A company’s ability to create deep tech solutions in any one (or several) of these fields truly adds value to customers in the long term.  3. Prepare the infrastructure for growth  History has shown us that companies with the right product offering can grow exponentially when the markets turn up.  However, for blockchain businesses that experience exponential growth in a short space of time, it is very impractical to scale the physical node operations themselves. Service outages across popular blockchain platforms is a common occurrence during a bull market, which is equivalent to a power cut at a big retail store on Black Friday.  What this means is that blockchain businesses must also prepare their infrastructure for that potential wave of customers that could occur at any moment, while managing the associated costs and overhead.  Again, Ethereum serves as an example by scheduling EIP-4844 proto-danksharding in the fall of 2023 as a scaling solution for its thriving layer 2 ecosystem. Without taking sides on which of the layer 2 variations will be successful, the infrastructure enhancement will increase capacity by 10 to 100 times as an important step towards the 100,000 TPS goal.  Conclusion  This coming year will be a time for building. When markets return, companies that take advantage of this time will be ideally positioned.  The Holy Grail for the next wave of crypto adoption will be when customers use blockchain seamlessly, without needing to know or understand the underlying tech.

The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) of Japan addresses issues with administrative reform and collaborates with the U.S. to enact defensive and foreign policies. The term Administrative Reform refers to multiple themes in the nation. An example of such themes is adopting measures like tax reform to stand the test of economic strain. Japan Set To Ease Stringent Tax Rules In line with its objectives to promote fast economic growth, the Japanese ruling party’s (LDP) tax committee held a meeting on December 15. The meeting was to deliberate on tax reforms. While at it, they approved an August-tabled proposal. The proposal seeks to remove taxes on crypto companies’ paper gains from issuance or custody tokens. The Japanese government seeks to ease tax requirements on domestic crypto firms to facilitate the growth of the tech and finance sectors. Submission of more lenient crypto tax laws to parliament will commence in January and will take effect in the next financial year beginning in April. LDP lawmaker and member of the Web3 policy office, Akihisa Shiozaki, spoke on the recent development in an interview with Bloomberg. Shiozaki noted that the move is a step forward in the economic reforms. He added that it would allow more companies to start token issuance businesses.

He cited practical examples using the digitization of national identity cards. In October, the Japan Virtual and Crypto Assets Exchange Association announced plans to ease the strict screening process for listing tokens on exchanges.

According to a senior analyst at data and research firm PitchBook, venture capital investors are still betting on Web3.  Robert Le, senior emerging research analyst, told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” that VC funding has been shifting away from centralized crypto services such as lenders and exchanges, while companies involved with expanding Web 3 have seen an increase in investment.  “Web 3 is one area that investors have deployed a lot more money over the last six months,” Le said, including the metaverse, gaming and other blockchain-based technologies. During the third quarter of 2022, VCs invested an estimated $1.5 billion into Web3-based companies.  Read more: Gaming Platform Forte Partners With Venture Studio SuperLayer to Expand Beyond Web3 Gaming  According to PitchBook's latest report on third-quarter emerging technologies, by 2027 Web3-based content platforms will bring in an estimated $39 billion in revenue, versus the $3.4 billion in revenue that is expected to be earned by the end of 2022.  “What you have seen, though, is that there’s been a shift away from centralized crypto services,” Le added.  VC investing for “exchanges, custodial wallets, crypto on-ramps” and “a lot of centralized lending and borrowing services” fell by about 85%, he said, quoting the report. Le said while the decline is sharp, it’s “not surprising” considering the high-profile failures of many companies, including Celsius Network and BlockFi.  Le said the decline in VC funding was taking place “even before the FTX collapse.” The failed centralized exchange, based in the Bahamas, filed for bankruptcy protection last month, not long after a CoinDesk report revealed FTX’s corporate sibling, Alameda Research, was being propped up by FTX’s native token, FTT.  Looking ahead, Le said crypto winter is going to prompt “non-crypto” investors to get out, and that is why “investments are going to continue to decline into 2023.”  “You're gonna really see a bifurcation,” he said. “You know, over the last 18 months everyone was investing in the crypto space, whether it's crypto-native investors, hedge funds, crossover funds, family offices. You're gonna see a lot of the non-crypto investors move away from this area.”  However, while venture funding will continue to decline into 2023, his company is “looking at some time in the second half of next year where venture investments will continue to increase. And we're being cautiously optimistic here.""  By the second half of next year, the firm said in its report it expects to see an increase in disclosures from crypto platforms, as well as the possibility of regulatory clarity, which could ultimately give crypto investors “a little more confidence.”  Read more: Crypto Is at ‘Brick Wall Stage' and Needs ‘Right Balance’ of Regulation, Says Legal Expert",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2022/12/16/crypto-winter-isnt-chilling-vcs-from-investing-in-web3-says-pitchbook-analyst,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bd5809fd2532a885630f89969c357decba57edd0-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Stablecoin Deposits To Spot Exchanges Have Shown Increasing Demand Recently As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, there has been an increasing demand on spot exchanges recently. The relevant indicator here is the “stablecoin exchange depositing transactions,” which measures the total number of transfers involving these fiat-tied tokens that are heading towards exchanges. Investors usually use stablecoins whenever they want to escape the volatility associated with coins like Bitcoin. Once the holders feel the prices are right to re-enter into these volatile markets, they transfer their accumulated stables to exchanges for swapping them into their desired cryptocurrency. So, a large amount of these tokens entering into exchanges can act as buying pressure for other markets, and thus provide a bullish effect to the prices of Bitcoin and other assets. Unlike the normal inflow metric, which simply measures the total amount flowing into exchanges, this indicator paints an idea about the actual demand in the market since it counts individual transfers, which can’t be inflated by a few large investors as their transaction count will be much lesser than their inflow values. Related Reading: Ethereum Active Addresses At Highest Since May 2021, Good News For ETH? Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in this metric, as well as the opposite one that keeps track of withdrawal transactions: The value of the metric seems to have increased in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As the above graph shows, the stablecoin exchange depositing transactions metric has observed some growth recently, and at the same time, the withdrawing transactions have gone down instead. This means that there is demand to buy with stables right now, while there isn’t much interest in exiting from volatile markets using these fiat-tied tokens. Related Reading: Why This Bitcoin Bearish Divergence Could Spell Doom For BTC Rally Such a situation has proved to be bullish for the price of Bitcoin in the last few months, as the previous instances of this trend in the chart display. “With the number of stablecoin deposits up-trending & the number of stablecoin withdraws down-trending, the capitulation events could be reaching an end,” notes the quant. The analyst believes these inflows can fuel a new rally, saying “such pick up in retail investor sentiment could potentially lead to a Christmas rally.” It now remains to be seen whether these stablecoin inflows will turn out to be constructive for the price this time or not.

Those paying attention might still be dizzy from the roller-coaster ride.  Optimism early in the week reversed, with bitcoin’s price settling in just below $17,000. On a relative basis, BTC’s seven-day performance against the U.S. dollar was third among the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.  Ether finished in the middle of the pack, declining 5% over the last seven days. TONCOIN led the way, increasing 30%  BTC’s chart doesn’t offer much by way of short-term optimism. Its Relative Strength Index (RSI) has fallen near 40, implying that BTC momentum is essentially neutral at the moment.  The Volume Profile Visible Range tool shows significant past trading activity and price agreement between $16,500 and $17,000. The combination of these factors sets the framework for BTC to trade flat, in lieu of a new catalyst.  CoinDesk Market Index sector performance  Month-to-date performance among CMI sectors shows that the CoinDesk Currency Index (CCY) has led the way – although in this case “leading the way” really just amounts to decreasing by the least.

Bollinger Bands are a technical indicator that tracks an asset’s 20-day moving average, and calculates price bands that are two standard deviations above and below that average. Statistically, prices stay within two standard deviations of its average approximately 95% of the time, so a move beyond either band is important to monitor.  In trending markets, a move beyond an upper or lower band can signal a sharp price move in that direction.

Greenwood, 45, who allegedly called the investors “idiots” in an internal message, pleaded guilty to wire fraud and conspiracy to launder money.  “Karl Sebastian Greenwood operated one of the largest international fraud schemes ever perpetrated,” said Damian Williams, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. “Greenwood and his co-conspirators, including fugitive Ruja Ignatova, conned unsuspecting victims out of billions of dollars, claiming that OneCoin would be the ‘Bitcoin killer.’”  Ignatova, known as the “CryptoQueen,” remains on the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) Most Wanted list as another founder of OneCoin, which was based in Bulgaria. The FBI is offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to her arrest.  Williams said this case and other recent actions are meant to send “a clear message that we are coming after all those who seek to exploit the cryptocurrency ecosystem through fraud, no matter how big or sophisticated you are.”  Greenwood, a citizen of Sweden and the U.K., had been arrested at his home in Thailand in 2018 and extradited to the U.S.  Read More: OneCoin Co-Conspirator Frank Schneider Faces Money-Laundering Charges",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/12/16/co-founder-of-onecoin-pyramid-scheme-pleads-guilty-cryptoqueen-still-wanted,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a9988b9c48767a807a593d93a6d290111f8ea464-1619x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42388361,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qREfS3,1671216374,Japan to Exempt Token Issuers From Corporate Tax on Unrealized Gains,"Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) tax committee approved a proposal to exempt crypto startups that issue their own tokens from paying corporate taxes on unrealized gains, a party politician said Friday.  Akihisa Shiozaki, secretary-general of the party’s Web3 project team, told CoinDesk that the proposal will be included in annual tax policy guidelines that come before the country’s parliament in January, and will come into effect in the next tax year starting April 1.  Under current corporate tax rules, token issuers are subject to a tax rate around 35% on unrealized gains for tokens that they hold, if their tokens are listed on an active market. Holdings are taxed based on their market value at the end of the taxation period. This tax in effect drove project founders to leave Japan and set up entities elsewhere.  Industry associations submitted other tax reform proposals, which included taxing crypto gains at the same rate as stocks and taxing individuals only when they convert crypto gains to fiat currency. These are unlikely to go through this year and will likely come up again in the LDP’s tax discussions next winter.  Still, “the most fundamental one is approved,” Sota Watanabe, founder of Astar Network, a platform that supports transactions on multiple blockchains, told CoinDesk, calling the approval “a win for crypto people, especially founders.”  The proposal to do away with the tax on paper gains was part of an interim policy proposal issued on Thursday by the Web3 project team.  It also included recommendations on enacting a law on LLC-type decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO), supporting the issuance of yen-based permissionless stablecoins, governance reforms at the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association that handles token screening, and guidelines on how crypto companies can be audited.  Shiozaki told CoinDesk that the project team will set up an informal discussion forum for the accounting associations, Web3 businesses, and the Financial Services Agency.

Due to an emphasis on infrastructure throughout 2022, crypto is now at the phase where it is not lacking for infrastructure options. As we look ahead to 2023, what crypto needs is applications that will encourage user adoption and pave the way for Web2's transition to Web3.  And so, in 2023, we will see developers shift their focus away from building out infrastructure offerings and instead turn to the application layer.  Tony Cheng is a general partner at Foresight Ventures. This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's Crypto 2023 series.  Advancing gaming  While blockchain gives users an upper hand when it comes to gaming, especially in terms of ownership, there is ample opportunity for developers to create applications that enhance the performance of those games.  In Web2, the gaming skins industry alone is worth $50 billion, but players don’t actually own the assets outside of the games in which they are used. This constraint in Web2 gaming can be overcome by turning skins into non-fungible tokens (NFT) in Web3 gaming.  The current Web3 gaming market is characterized by play-to-earn games, which particularly appeal to players in developing economies who can make a significant income from their game earnings. However, these games are not known for their user experience or imaginative worlds. They are typically utilitarian, which dramatically limits their appeal.  Play-to-earn has endless potential. The esports market alone is projected to grow to $5.48 billion by 2029. Play-to-earn allows players to make money as they play, opening up the opportunity for more individuals than ever to earn a living from gaming. At the same time, with the large amounts of investments into the blockchain gaming industry (more than $3 billion in 2022), we will see increasingly higher-quality gaming projects.  Read more: Why Finding the Right Crypto Talent for Ecosystem Success Is Important | Opinion  Given the market gaps in Web2 and Web3 gaming, there are massive opportunities for decentralized gaming applications. There is also great potential for gamification across different industries utilizing the incentive models native to Web3.  Enhancing identity  Blockchain enables the creation of portable digital identities (DID), which allow users to effortlessly transfer information and assets across different networks and chains. Today, this technology empowers individuals by allowing them to truly own their own data and retain privacy while still meeting know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) requirements demanded by both Web2 and Web3 platforms.  Applications that provide data security and increased scalability can take DIDs to the next level. Utilizing infrastructure now at their disposal, developers can build decentralized applications (dapp) that help users seamlessly move across different platforms while retaining sovereignty of their information and identities.  Right now, applications are being developed at a rapid pace and are set to enhance DIDs and make them more accessible than ever before, meaning the new wave of Web3 users will have DIDs and everything they offer at their fingertips.  See also: Crypto 2023: It's Sanctions Season | Opinion  Reimagining Web2  Instead of building Web3 versions of Web2 apps, the question remains: Can developers leverage crypto to redesign existing Web2 apps as they function now?  Many Web2 apps already have millions in both daily active users (DAU) and monthly active users (MAU) – metrics that are significantly higher than those of some of the largest existing dapps today. By adding crypto and Web3 functionalities to these in-demand Web2 apps, developers can use decentralization and tokenization as avenues for increased growth and monetization.  For example, existing fintech payment apps can benefit from the addition of crypto payment rails and blockchain technology, which can be used to verify information or improve fund-on-file tokenization. Existing Web2 apps can also issue tokens to use as a transfer medium.Web3 tooling can be integrated into creator-focused platforms, enhancing the ability for influencers to interact with users and better monetize their audiences.

42407224,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gUJrw1,1671213088,2023: The Year DAOs Follow the Law?,"Many say that 2023 will be the “Year of the DAO” because of the explosion in the number of decentralized autonomous organizations and significant advancements in software that make it easier for anyone to start a DAO. So 2023 will likely be the year of the DAO, but will 2023 also be the year that DAOs start following the law?  “Breaking the law” might come off as extreme, but if you’re not registered as a legal entity, you’re essentially not recognized by governments.  Adam Miller is the CEO and co-founder of MIDAO. This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's Crypto 2023 series.  While it’s not necessarily the most intuitive decision for every new business owner, much of the modern economy relies on organizations obtaining legal status. For a traditional company or organization, for-profit or nonprofit, large or small, one of the first things to do is create a legal entity for the organization, which usually takes the form of a corporation, a foundation or a limited liability company (LLC).  The problem is, if a group of people engages in a common enterprise without a legal entity, whether they call themselves a DAO, a company, a commune or anything else, the law treats them as a general partnership.  What’s so bad about being a general partnership?  There are three main problems.  The first problem is that in a general partnership, the individuals involved are each liable for the organization's actions and the actions of other individuals involved. So if something goes wrong with a DAO, such as fraud, a hack or an accident, it is easy for the other members of the organization or people outside the organization to sue you as an individual member and go after your money, your home and everything you own.  The second problem is that a general partnership is not treated as a person in the eyes of the law – i.e., it has no corporate personhood. This means it cannot sign contracts to do things like open bank accounts, buy and own property, sue and be sued or hire employees. Of course, not every DAO will want to open a bank account (since it can easily use an on-chain treasury), but most DAOs will at least want to own the intellectual property of their own logo and trademarks.  Read more: Rebuilding the Crypto Yield Market After the Meltdown | Opinion  The third problem is that when general partnerships make money, the individuals involved in the organization are personally liable for taxes on those earnings. If you own 10% of a general partnership, you pay taxes on 10% of the organization’s profits. The same is true for DAOs, but most people have not realized it yet!  Most DAOs (all of the unincorporated ones), whether they know it or not, have all three of these problems. They do not require their members to pay their share of taxes on the DAOs’ earnings. Therefore, it is just a matter of time before the tax man (U.S. Internal Revenue Service or otherwise) comes for them and finds that the DAO members owe taxes they have not been paying. And when more unincorporated DAOs and their members start getting sued, they will find that they are not following the law that they would need to follow to avoid the associated personal liability.  So, how can DAOs follow the law?  In early 2021, there were no good options available for DAOs to incorporate. Individual states or countries only offered legal entities that would require DAOs to make too many compromises. For example, they would require DAOs to keep a list of members’ full names and addresses, elect a board of directors or trustees who would have power over the organization and keep written records of decisions made at meetings.  2022, however, flipped this script. Today, DAOs have the option to engage with authorities and legal systems, and several jurisdictions now recognize the newest evolution of human organization. Wyoming and Tennessee in the United States and the Republic of the Marshall Islands have all created DAO LLCs, which are highly flexible and powerful legal entities that are custom-made for DAOs with all the benefits of traditional LLCs. Additionally, Colorado Limited Cooperative Associations (LCA) and Unincorporated Nonprofit Associations (UNA) have been used with success by some DAOs, while others have chosen to create foundations in Switzerland, the Cayman Islands or the British Virgin Islands.  Since the beginning of this year, hundreds of DAOs have incorporated in these jurisdictions, which has granted those DAOs access to banking, protected their members from personal liability and, in many cases, ensured the DAOs can pay their own taxes. In fact, for nonprofit organizations, incorporating usually means paying no income taxes at all.  See also: Forget CBDCs, Here's Where the Biden Administration Needs to Focus in 2023 | Opinion  Does following the law reduce decentralization?  A common concern DAO members have when considering incorporation is whether it makes their DAO less decentralized, thus going against a core value of Web3. The thinking goes that having a legal entity creates one point of failure that is less censorship resistant than an unincorporated DAO. Consider, however, that the purpose of the entity is to create a liability target for anyone who wants to sue the DAO. If the legal entity is ever sued and drained of funds or forced out of business, that does not mean that the members of the DAO will lose their tokens, governance smart contracts or ability to reorganize and resume operations as a sort-of second chance. Having an entity does not create a target where there was none before; it just moves the target away from DAO members as individuals.  Another benefit of a legal entity is that one can use the entity’s governance documents (bylaws, operating agreements, etc.) to legally require the organization to be decentralized in governance and operations. An unincorporated DAO has no recourse if a small group of individuals or a powerful third party accumulates too much power and effectively centralizes the organization.  If this past year has taught the crypto community anything, it is that no matter how regulated and trustworthy something appears, centralized entities can be co-opted, and human greed can be obfuscated. Hopefully, the wakeup calls of 2022 – from Celsius Network to FTX – show the need to decentralize assets and decision-making and will lead to a renaissance in DAOs. With accelerating investment in DAO tooling, DAOs will become leaner and more efficient and be as frictionless to participate in during a normal day as checking your Telegram messages. One way to get to this next level is to make the necessary handshake with the existing legal system in order to enable DAOs to mature and integrate with the rest of the global economy. Doing so does not require a compromise in decentralization and can serve as a means by which 2023 will become the year of the DAO.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Adam Miller,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/12/16/2023-the-year-daos-follow-the-law,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/450d7349c9ea8c218d7ad198c96e1da68afa2bf6-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

An accompanying document by the committee, which is the primary global standard setter for the prudential regulation of banks, suggested that a bank's exposure to certain crypto assets must not exceed 2% and should generally be lower than 1%. These particular assets are tokenized traditional assets including non-fungible tokens, stablecoins and unbacked crypto assets that don't meet classification conditions. Meanwhile, those assets from the list above that do meet the criteria ""are subject to capital requirements based on the risk weights of underlying exposures as set out in the existing Basel Framework.""  Previously a group of eight traditional finance lobby groups had written to the committee suggesting that just a 1% cap on banks could be too restrictive and could derail innovations using distributed ledger technology. Now there is more wiggle room.  “Today’s endorsement by the GHOS (Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision) marks an important milestone in developing a global regulatory baseline for mitigating risks to banks from crypto assets,"" said Tiff Macklem, chair of the GHOS, the oversight body of the committee.  The classification conditions the committee have set out include ensuring crypto passes a redemption risk test and basis risk test. ""The redemption risk test is to ensure that the reserve assets are sufficient to enable the crypto assets to be redeemable at all times,"" the report said. Meanwhile, the basis risk test ""aims to ensure that the holder of a crypto asset can sell it in the market for an amount that closely tracks the peg value,"" the report said.  Regulators have taken a cautious approach to regulating the crypto sector, which has been extremely volatile lately. Billions of dollars were wiped out of the crypto market within a year after the fall of Terra, FTX and their related companies and tokens.  The crypto standards the committee set out will be added into the consolidated Basel Framework shortly, the report said.

42388360,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qREfNN,1671211871,The Faulty Moral Universe of Sam Bankman-Fried,"While the con itself was huge and sprawling, it’s not mere scale that makes the FTX fiasco the most riveting corporate fraud in living memory. There’s also the sheer panoply of stories within the broader narrative – the polycule, the political donations, the failure of investor due diligence, the strategic philanthropic pose. Every angle of FTX seems to highlight some deeper 21st century social, technological or political quandary.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  But for my money the most important and bizarre twist in the downfall of Sam Bankman-Fried is that his parents were, until their son’s crimes were exposed, respected scholars of corporate tax law and ethics at Stanford University.  On an interpersonal level, the situation is Shakespearean: The legal scholar parents are likely to have both their livelihoods and their legacies destroyed by the sins of their child. The parents have direct ethical exposure to the con, through both a $16 million house purchased in their names in the Bahamas and payments they received from the company, as revealed this week in testimony by FTX liquidation CEO John Jay Ray III.  See also: How Sam Bankman-Fried's 'Effective' Altruism Blew Up FTX | The Node  Seemingly as a consequence of these entanglements, Bankman-Fried’s father, Joseph Bankman, has been removed from the Stanford teaching schedule for next year. The parents have also reportedly told friends they foresee total financial ruin from the costs of their son’s legal defense.  But the specifics of the parents’ ideas, and how they might have influenced Sam Bankman-Fried’s actions, are at least as fascinating as the interpersonal drama.  Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried’s scholarly work on corporate ethics in some cases advocated for unorthodox attitudes towards right and wrong. Their ideas share many of the underpinnings of the “effective altruism” movement that Bankman-Fried espoused. Those included rationalism, the idea that decisions can be made entirely on the basis of known facts and predictable outcomes; utilitarianism, the idea that outcomes are more important than principles or intentions; and a thread of disdain for the conventional ethics shared by mere mortals.  Unpacking the entirety of that ideology will be the work of many months and many hands, but a colleague recently pointed me towards a very convenient encapsulation of it: A 2013 paper by Barbara Fried titled “Beyond Blame.” The paper is summarized as arguing that “the philosophy of personal responsibility has ruined criminal justice and economic policy. It’s time to move past blame.”  I know – it’s so on the nose it’s hard to believe.  There’s some nuance to Fried’s argument, but the core idea is that individuals should not face moral criticism for their mistakes because individual free will is an illusion. The question of human free will is still very unresolved in both scientific and philosophical terms. There is the “nature-nurture” question: Are we responsible for our actions if we had a terrible upbringing? There is also the deeper question of biology, consciousness and the soul: If our actions are determined by the sequenced firing of neurons in our brain, where is the “me” making decisions?  See also: Understanding the FTX Fallout From the Eyes of a Bitcoiner | Opinion  These questions have not been definitively answered, and may never be. But Barbara Fried seems to take the nonexistence of free will as a settled matter in her 2013 paper. This assumption that human beings are little more than automata is deeply woven into the very Silicon Valley-friendly neoliberal worldview. Neoliberalism broadly conceives of the world as a mass of largely interchangeable individuals engaged in purely rational decision-making in a marketplace, and would just as soon throw out inconveniences like religion, community and, yes, ethics, as impediments to the smooth global flow of data and economic units.  The ultimate insignificance of individuals – up to and including the blamelessness of very powerful individuals – is deeply baked into the neoliberal ethos. Fried’s 2013 paper spells out the ethical dimension of this worldview, taking aim at “retributivists” who would punish wrongdoers despite their lack of free will (which, again, Fried seems to take as given). It’s quite notable that this paper emerged in the years after the subprime mortgage collapse of 2008, for which effectively no one ever faced punishment.  The paper features many passages that are damning in light of what came after, but one in particular stands out.  “In the hands of hardcore retributivists,” Fried writes, “the argument [for individual blame] has a decidedly Dickensian cast. To quote one proponent, when we punish someone, we respect his ‘fundamental human right to be treated as a person’ by permitting him to ‘make the choices that will determine what happens to him’ and then respecting his ‘right to be punished for what [he has] done.’ Lord save us all from such respect.”  Barbara Fried here displays a frankly unnerving disdain for the very basic principle of individual moral responsibility. That disdain seemed to manifest in at least two recent moments of FTX fallout.  First, there was the staggeringly evasive testimony Sam Bankman-Fried planned to give before the House Financial Services Committee – testimony forestalled by his arrest in the Bahamas. In that testimony, Bankman-Fried would have blamed his company’s failure on everyone from Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao to, hilariously, the bankruptcy law firm and interim CEO who are currently cleaning up his massive mess.  The testimony is first and foremost disturbingly delusional. It does not even remotely square with the known facts of the situation, which are that Sam Bankman-Fried engaged in elaborate self-dealing and theft of his customers’ funds. But viewed through the lens of his mother’s ideology, the testimony is not merely delusional. It is also a reiteration of the belief that all of our actions are merely the product of circumstance, and that we can’t really ever be blamed for anything.  The second episode that seems to connect to Barbara Fried’s determinist anti-humanism is far sadder. She and Joseph Bankman were present for their son’s arraignment in the Bahamas on Tuesday. A source present in the courtroom has told me that Barbara Fried laughed with audible disdain as the allegations against her son were read aloud – laughed with a kind of manic intensity, so loudly and repeatedly that she seemed on the verge of disrupting the hearing.  We can only speculate at what was going through Barbara Fried’s head as she watched her supposedly brilliant son in shackles, but her disrespect for the court seems clear. After downplaying personal moral responsibility and the enforcement of ethical behavior as mere petty ""retributivism,"" she was getting a harsh reminder that most humans alive today still believe that there is a clear difference between right and wrong, and that violators of that norm deserve both punishment and condemnation. She was also realizing – perhaps at the exact moment her son was denied bail – that she and her family were about to pay a huge price for disregarding thousands of years of human morality.

42394080,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvXFhH,1671210180,FTX and Crypto Bust Show Capitalism’s Limits,"Capitalism failed crypto. Or perhaps they failed each other.  No, I’m not trying to exonerate Sam Bankman-Fried and all those who have abused people’s trust and destroyed faith in this industry.  And, no, I’m not a Communist. I am as strong a believer as any reasonable reader of history that market economies do a far better job of allocating capital than centrally planned ones.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  I just want to acknowledge that capitalism doesn’t always deliver desired results. For its “invisible hand” to work, the market needs to be open and competitive. For the reliable, constantly adjusting price signals that economic actors need to form well-reasoned investment decisions, there must be sufficient information about the factors behind the demand and supply conditions determining those prices.  Until 2022 and, most importantly, until the collapse of FTX exposed a gaping difference between image and reality, such transparency did not exist, not at the level required for the crypto industry to enjoy trustworthy price signals.  It’s not just FTX, it’s the entire industry  I’m not just talking about FTX’s mind-boggling accounting practices (or lack thereof). I’m referring to what we knew, or didn’t, about the conditions driving the soaring token prices that attracted millions of retail customers into multiple crypto exchanges and lending platforms, inflows that spun up billions of dollars in fees and, by extension, attracted great gobs of venture funding to those companies.  We’re all astounded that FTX, now essentially worth nothing, was valued at $32 billion a few months ago, and that lending service Celsius Network clocked in at $3.5 billion before it went under. But we should be asking similar questions about the investments and deposits that poured into Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, Crypto.com and other such exchanges. I’m not suggesting that they too are on the verge of bankruptcy or are suspected of fraud, rather that we should reflect on the inflated expectations for long-term growth that drew the influx into the entire industry.  Investors fell for a kind of capitalism head fake. For a time, the spectacular outsized profits generated by these centralized rent-extracting machines suggested to venture capitalists that they were the businesses into which they should be investing. According to the rationale of the market, they were onto something. The market was saying “this is the future.”  Tragically, we now know this was a false signal. There was no there there. A good chunk of the token exchange and lending business was built on a house of cards, an elaborate interconnection of leveraged positions across a crypto ecosystem sustained by a collective belief in “number go up.” It was really just a toxic mix of momentum trading, opportunism and rehypothecation (allowing assets to collateralize several transactions). It was never sustainable.  We should have recognized from the start that the triple-digit yields offered on various decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms during boom periods in 2021 were unjustified, not just because they were insanely high relative to traditional finance but also because there was insufficient real-world utility underpinning them. The same could be said for the trading activity and fees earned by centralized finance (CeFi) platforms.  For there to have been enough base-level utility to sustain the trading prices higher up the chain, there needed to be a lot more investment in underlying real-world use cases for tokenized value exchange, such as in decentralized energy. But the market wasn’t signaling that that’s where the money should go. It was saying “go all in” on FTX, Celsius and their ilk.  Read more: Need a Use Case for Decentralization? Start With Energy  Fixing information asymmetry  How do we fix this?  Sadly, we can’t just exhort people to reject get-rich-quick promises in favor of smaller, more sustainable opportunities in cross-border remittances, non-fungible token (NFT) loyalty projects, distributed digital identity solutions or any number of other real-world applications. Speculators are gonna speculate.  What we need is more reliable information about crypto businesses and industries, not just data on the short-term profitability of exchanges and lenders but in-depth details on the underlying foundation of those returns and their long-term sustainability.  Perhaps with that information, venture investors will ignore short-term opportunities associated with speculation and instead invest in real, longer-term projects.  But there’s still a problem here and it lies with Silicon Valley. Given that token models now offer venture capitalists the prospects of a much earlier exit than the five-year liquidity lockups they’re traditionally subjected to, they may still be incentivized to ignore indications of long-term challenges and continue to bet on short-term bubble moments, knowing they can always pass their bags to the next greater fool. They can do this because they get early access to exclusive “data rooms” during funding round deals, giving them an informational advantage over later-arriving small investors.  This is the “information asymmetry” problem that securities laws are supposed to guard against. We can think about it in terms of the parties in any later-stage funding round: the investable entity itself, which knows everything; its early investors, who know a lot but not everything; and the prospective targeted investors, who are much more in the dark. These kinds of asymmetries are one of the fundamental causes of price signal distortions. Forced disclosures by securities regulations narrow that information gap.  Regulate or self-regulate?  It should be obvious by now that for CeFi exchanges such as FTX, tougher regulation, including registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission, is unavoidable. The question is how far should such regulation go?  Despite everything, a strong argument remains that excessive regulation – for example, the draconian bill introduced this week by Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) – could easily backfire by killing innovation. There are especially big risks if securities laws are unreasonably targeted at the software developers of DeFi projects for which there is no identifiable centralized authority.

This led it to publish its proof of reserve (PoR) reports. However, the collapse of some firms like Celsius Network, FTX, and others has instilled fear and doubts about crypto exchanges and platforms. Investors lost confidence majorly in centralized platforms. Hence, most CEXs have taken to publishing their proof of reserve assets to indicate the safety of users’ funds. Related Reading: Solana: This Minor Hiccup Didn’t Discourage Investors From Acquiring SOL – Until Today Difference In Binance’s Reported BTC Holding Some revelations hint at the under-reporting of the Binance PoR assets. For example, according to on-chain data provider Glassnode, the crypto exchange balance shows a total Bitcoin holding of almost 584,600 BTC. But the exchange reported having about 359,300 BTC in its Proof of Reserves (PoR). This discrepancy of 200,000 BTC, Glassnode points out, shows an under-reporting of its BTC holdings. The difference is worth approximately $3.4 billion at the current market price. The Ethereum balance, as reported by Binance in its proof of reserve and the on-chain data provider, was similar. Both reports showed about 4.65 million ETH held in Binance reserves. Also, data from Glassnode showed that the exchange’s balances witnessed increased volatility through December. This happened due to the FUD surrounding Binance, as the exchange faced a similar situation to FTX. The FUD had triggered increased withdrawals from the crypto exchange. Ethereum balance vs self-reported reserves Binance Records Massive Outflows The exchange has witnessed more outflows with the growing tension regarding the PoR report. In addition, according to on-chain data, Binance Bitcoin Deposit and Withdrawal Volume revealed more BTC withdrawals over the past few days. The platform recently recorded significant outflows of 57,300 BTC. However, the flows of Ether have been more stable on Binance than Bitcoin. Data on Ethereum Deposit and Withdrawal Volume shows the largest daily outflow of 456,700 ETH. Notably, most investors preferred the self-custody approach after the collapse of the FTX exchange. Also, the exchange recorded considerable volume in combined outflows of stablecoins. An equivalent of about $3.2 billion worth of stablecoins left the exchange in the last 30 days. This is because the coins remained the central part of the Binance FUD. Some withdrawn stablecoins include BUSD, USDT, USDC, and DAI.

The FSOC – a panel of U.S. financial agency chiefs that includes U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and the heads of several other regulatory agencies – met Friday to discuss risks to the financial system and approve the council’s annual report. While echoing the same widely held concerns about an inability to reach into spot markets for tokens that aren’t securities, the report shared another common position: Only Congress can give the agencies the powers they need to establish a full set of rules that covers the whole crypto industry.  The report specifically recommended ""legislation relating to regulators’ authorities to have visibility into and supervise the activities of all of the affiliates and subsidiaries of crypto-asset entities.""  Yellen said risks from digital asset represent one of the ""key priorities"" in this year's report.  ""We have seen significant shocks and volatility in the crypto assets system over the past year, including in recent months,"" she said.  The FSOC was built as the ultimate lookout for future financial tsunamis after the global mess in 2008. Officials were quick to point out that crypto’s current troubles don’t pose any current risk to the traditional system during the meeting. The Treasury document illustrated that point with the fresh example of industry turmoil caused by the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange, which left U.S. banking unscathed.  ""The problems at FTX precipitated price decreases in bitcoin and other crypto-assets, but thus far have had a limited impact on the broader U.S. financial system,"" the document noted.  In a separate closed-door portion of the meeting, the regulators – including Gary Gensler, the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and Rostin Behnam, who runs the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) – discussed the recent crypto market dramas. According to a summary of that conversation later released by the Treasury Department, the members are watching those developments closely and ""spillovers to the traditional financial system have remained limited"" so far.  ""While the risks from the crypto markets generally do not appear to date to have spread to the traditional financial sector, we must remain vigilant to guard against that possibility,"" Gensler said in the open meeting. Already, he argued, the ""largely non-compliant market"" is putting individual investors at risk.  The annual report also flagged a topic that could be considered a legacy of FTX: Its campaign to cut out the middlemen in clearing crypto derivatives trades, including the proposal that customers’ positions could be closed out by an automated system. The council called for a closer look at the dangers that concept might pose, even though FTX’s proposal to the CFTC was dropped by the company when it collapsed.  The sentiments expressed in the latest annual report are similar to the much lengthier document released by the council in October at the behest of President Joe Biden’s executive order. That earlier report suggested Congress needs to soon pick an agency that will have power over the spot markets for bitcoin trading and any other cryptocurrencies that aren’t deemed securities. So far, most legislation favors the CFTC in that role.  Read More: What’s Inside the FSOC’s Long-awaited Report on Crypto Regulation  UPDATE (Dec. 16, 2022, 17:01 UTC): Adds details from the report.

The plan is subject to approval by Zipmex's creditors in a vote, the person said.  The recovery process is an arrangement – exact details of which have not been disclosed – which Zipmex expects to be effective around early April of next year, when its creditor protection ends.  As part of its effort, the exchange hopes to simplify the process by offering ""a more administratively light solution"" in the form of a private settlement between Zipmex and the customer, the person told CoinDesk.  At the start of this month, the exchange secured creditor protection for all its entities until April. It was also reported that Zipmex was nearing a $100 million buyout deal with venture capital fund V Ventures giving the fund a 90% stake in the exchange.  Zipmex was caught in the headlights of the downturn in the crypto market in June, when loans worth $53 million to Babel Finance and Celsius Network failed to be repaid. Zipmex hired Australian restructuring firm KordaMentha to put together a recovery plan in August.  Established in 2018, Zipmex offers crypto trading and investment services in Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore and Australia.

42388369,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qREgCp,1671206643,Media Groups Win Right to Argue for Publication of FTX’s Million-Strong Creditor List,"Media companies including the New York Times and Bloomberg will be allowed to formally plead for FTX to publish the full list of as many as a million of its creditors, U.S. Judge John Dorsey ruled Friday.  Since the crypto exchange collapsed Nov. 11, bankruptcy hearings to restore funds to those owed money are still bogged down in procedural questions, including whether to grant access to liquidators undertaking parallel proceedings in the Bahamas.  FTX had sought to keep a list of its creditors – all of its former users and parties to which it currently owes money – sealed and redacted, arguing it was an “asset” that could be useful further down the line of its bankruptcy process. Government officials and reporters pushed back, arguing that the list of names should be shared as bankruptcy hearings are normally public.  Disclosure “ is a basic premise of bankruptcy law ... fundamental to the operation of the bankruptcy system and ... the best means of avoiding any suggestion of impropriety that might or could be raised,” U.S. Trustee Andrew Vara said in a Dec. 12 filing. “The public has a right of access to judicial records.”  Vara is a U.S. Department of Justice official charged with aiding the bankruptcy process.  Dorsey, a federal judge with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of Delaware, said he approved of letting the media organizations, which also include the Financial Times and Dow Jones, intervene in favor of transparency, with a fuller hearing to be held on Jan. 11.  The media organizations sought to intervene in favor of publication in a Dec. 9 filing, making allusion to the poor record-keeping that appears to have plagued FTX’s governance.  “Debtors have been accused of lack of transparency in their business,” the legal filing by the media said. “That mindset appears to have carried over to this bankruptcy.”  The argument is whether to publish creditors’ names, and it’s likely that contact details such as email addresses for the creditors would still be kept private under any deal.  The move echoes a similar step in the bankruptcy hearing of crypto lender Celsius Network, which led to fears that exposing information about financial affairs could make users targets for harassment or theft.  Jurisdictional access  The case is also facing a widening jurisdictional dispute between the U.S. and the Bahamas, where CEO Sam Bankman-Fried ran the company and where he is currently imprisoned.  Jason Zakia, an attorney representing liquidators in the Bahamas, told Dorsey that allegations that Bahamian authorities had used access to systems to favor payments to local residents were “wholly without merit … the Bahamian legal system is an independent legal system that should be respected.”  “We can't even really begin to do our job in the Bahamas” without being granted access to FTX’s cloud-based platform, Zakia added, but said he would be content to have static access to data rather than a live link to the system. Dorsey is due to rule on that question at a Jan. 6 hearing.

42407227,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gUJsCY,1671206468,The Best Bitcoin Lightning Payment Solutions,"The pace of technological innovation in crypto finance is nothing short of astounding. Bitcoin, the “magic internet money” of yesterday, is now knocking on the doors of high street shops, bars and restaurants.  The Lightning Network (LN), a web of interconnected nodes managed by crypto enthusiasts, is driving this revolution. LN transaction throughput and speed are already rivalling those of Visa and Mastercard for a fraction of the cost.  Vlad Goryachev is a former Wall Street derivatives trader and structurer turned Bitcoin enthusiast. This article is part of CoinDesk's Crypto 2023.  More and more retail establishments are thinking to start accepting “crypto,” but don’t know where to start. This guide will present and compare side by side all the available options for the business owners to make an informed choice.  I’ll start by describing the solutions in alphabetical order and conclude with a summary matrix that could help retailers decide which to integrate. To qualify, each implementation must satisfy two criteria:  1) Enable businesses to accept BTC payments via Lightning Network  2) Do that face-to-face, (i.e., mom and pops and Box Top stores should be able to generate a Lightning invoice/QR code a client can scan to pay)  Some of the solutions will present an option to automatically convert the proceeds into local currency, others will not. It will be up to the business owner to decide whether to hold bitcoin or do the conversions manually.  See also: Move Over, Ethereum – Bitcoin's Lightning Network Has Apps Too  I leave out of the scope other blockchains and stablecoins. In this day and age they are objectively inferior to LN as a payment rail.  BitPay  A U.S. company that offers a centralized wallet and bookkeeping suite with ability to accept a range of cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin over the Lightning Network. To use it, a Lightning QR code is generated by the “BitPay Checkout” app linked with a users online BitPay account via an API code. Proceeds can be converted into local currency and withdrawn via ACH, SEPA, FPS, etc. Full KYC [know-your-customer] enrollment is required to start using the service. The company charges a flat 1% fee on the proceeds. Funds are at risk until withdrawn, because the wallet is centralized.  Other notes: Only the iPhone version of this app existed at the time of testing. Trustpilot rated it at a 1.3.  BitRequest  A free open-source app for iOS and Android that also accepts a range of cryptocurrencies, including Lightning bitcoin. Users can also send out remote requests for payment.  To use Lightning, BitRequest requires a user to already own a Lightning node. The solution does not have access to private keys, therefore it is non-custodial (requires no trust in any third-party). Owning a Lightning node involves setting up and managing Lightning Network connections, or channels, to other Lightning nodes – a task that requires both time and substantial investment. To convert proceeds into local currency, the user would have to open an account on a crypto exchange (KYC route) or use non-KYC, peer-to-peer services like bisq.network or Robosats.  Breez  A free and open-source app for Android that creates a non-custodial wallet and opens Lightning channels to a user's Breez node automatically (or to another chosen node). The first accepted payment, and each subsequent payment above 20 euro, bear a fee of 0.4% or a minimum of 2,000 sats, to cover channel opening costs. The channels get reused when money is paid out. The app does not offer conversion to fiat currencies, but can use any of them as a base to calculate the amount of sats for the Lightning invoice.  Breez is currently in beta testing and users must accept a warning that their funds could be lost. For this reason I could not include it in the summary matrix. However, I do find this solution very innovative.  BTCPay Server  BTCPay is a storied, non-custodial option that’s popular among crypto enthusiasts. The software code is free and open source and can be deployed through a variety of methods including a cloud or a local server. For example, one can install it with one click onto an Umbrel Lightning node running on a Raspberry Pi microcomputer. Such a server would be able to host a number of businesses (nearby shops and restaurants) all connecting to it via local Wi-Fi or cloud DNS. All of them, however, would need to trust the owner of the server. For users who do not want to set up and manage their own Lightning node there are cloud services like Voltage that allow renting for $10 per month. However, in this case the solution becomes custodial.  Confirmo  This option is made by a Slovakian company, and offers a similar service to BitPay for 0.8% fee. The app, which only requires an email to use, allows automatic daily settlement in crypto or fiat to a personal wallet or bank account. Though, KYC is required for fiat withdrawals. When I tested the app, I found that the BTC/EUR conversion rate was an average of 0.5% higher than prices listed on CoinMarketCap. Further, the app did not show the exchange rate or data source. There is a maximum of 0.03 BTC (600 euros) set for invoices. Crypto withdrawals, including Lightning, incur a 0.5% fee and fiat withdrawals potentially incur “additional bank fees,” according to the Confirmo website. Funds are at risk until withdrawn. Trustpilot rating: 3.0.  GoCrypto  This subsidiary of the Slovenia-based company Eligma offers a physical POS device for 450 euros plus shipping cost as well as a free web version. Transaction fees vary by country, from 1.25% to 5%. Proceeds can be received in over 50 cryptocurrencies with optional conversion to fiat. Payouts are executed four times a month. Online onboarding is not available to test the service. Funds are at risk until withdrawn. Trustpilot rating is not available.  Lightning Network Point of Sale  A lightweight web app offering a “hybrid” solution. It is open source and free to use. The software is simply a gateway to a crypto exchange Bitfinex, but is separate from the crypto exchange’s “BFX Pay” platform. It can be run from LNPOS.me website or installed on the user's own server.  See also: Bitcoin's Lightning Network Could Be Getting a Privacy Upgrade  LNPOS works by requesting a Lightning deposit address from the exchange, and displaying it on a user’s phone or tablet as a QR code. Proceeds are automatically converted to a range of local currencies and stablecoins. Easy registration with email is available for testing. KYC verification is necessary to withdraw fiat. Bitfinex does not accept U.S .customers. Trustpilot rating: 3.2.  LNBits  This is a “Lightning LEGO set"" or, as the developers call it, a “Free Open-Source Lightning Accounts System with Extensions.” Much like BTCPay Server, it can be installed on an Umbrel node and activated using a TPoS terminal extension. However, to start accepting bitcoin payments, users need to also build or purchase a physical DIY POS terminal. This solution involves manual fiat conversions and, to remain non-custodial, a Lightning node you control.  OpenNode  OpenNode is a registered corporation in Delaware that accepts Lightning payments and offers optional conversion to fiat. Upfront KYC is required. Weekly bitcoin withdrawals come with a 1% processing fee while on-demand withdrawals cost 1% extra for on-chain bitcoin (but are free for Lightning). Bank transfers charge a 0.2% fee in local currencies. Funds are at risk until withdrawn. Trustpilot rating: 3.0.  Any recommendations?  The best non-custodial solution for a technically apt bitcoin investor is BTCPay Server. For a more cautious user, who would like to convert all incoming proceeds into fiat and has no desire to manage a Lightning node, the LNPOS.me web-app is a free alternative outside the U.S. For U.S. customers, OpenNode has better reviews.

5732892,https://newsbtc.com/?p=512675,1671206432,Polygon Profitability Tanks As MATIC Nosedives 5.6%,"MATIC has had a rollercoaster of a year. Its price has fluctuated between cycle peaks and cycle lows year-to-date but has seen some good recoveries as well. However, as the week draws to a close, MATIC dove off its $0.9 cliff, and investor profitability has plummeted right along with it. MATIC Loses 5.6% In 24 Hours Over the last 24 hours, the price of MATIC is already down more than 5.6%, according to data from TradingView. The digital asset which had been able to maintain its $0.9 level for the last few weeks had eventually succumbed and drifted down. Related Reading: Whale Accumulation Paints Bullish Picture For XRP By the time the markets opened for trading on Friday, MATIC had already touched its 24-hour low of $0.84 before marking a small recovery back above $0.85. Its 5.6% decline coincided with a broader decline in the crypto market, which means it wasn’t an isolated incident for the token. It followed the likes of Ethereum (ETH) and Binance Coin (BNB), both of which had recorded more than 5% losses in the same time period. Volume was also down across the space with MATIC seeing an 18% decline in volume. Price trending at $0.85 | Source: MATICUSD on TradingView.com The digital asset also lost about $300 million from its market cap. Nevertheless, it retains its position as the 10th largest cryptocurrency in the space, sitting right behind Cardano (ADA) which was down almost 5% in the same 24-hour period. Profitability Drops Drastically An offshoot of the recent decline in MATIC price has been the drop in profitability for investors who hold the token. Data from IntoTheBlock shows that presently, only 23% of all wallets holding the cryptocurrency are recording a profit. Related Reading: What Ethereum’s Rejection At $1,350 Says About The Cryptocurrency The vast majority of holders, accounting for 68% of all wallets, are seeing losses. The remaining 9% are sitting in the neutral territory, putting them right at the price that they purchased their coins for. Only 23% of holders in profit | Source: IntoTheBlock Interestingly, unlike Bitcoin and Dogecoin, MATIC has a lower composition of long-term holders which could provide a reason for such low-profit percentages. Only 33% have held their coins for more than one year, whereas 57% have held them between one and 12 months, and 10% have only had their coins for less than one month. However, it is also important to note that MATIC’s 70% decline from its all-time high price of $2.90 in December 2021 plays a huge role in this. MATIC was exchanging hands at $5.11 at the time of this writing, down almost 8% over the last seven days.

5731051,https://newsbtc.com/?p=512674,1671202827,"Double-Digit Losses Brings Doge Below Critical Level, More Pain To Follow?","Dogecoin (DOGE) has seen some of the worst declines in the last week. The meme coin is already down double-digits during this time and is also recording losses on the daily charts. While this is not out of the ordinary given the current crypto market trend, the digital asset has been pulled below important critical levels, which would imply more declines. DOGE Could Go Down Further Given Elon Musk’s recent radio silence on his crypto plans for Twitter and thus Dogecoin by extension, the meme coin has been unable to maintain its upward momentum. It is now down almost 50% from its most recent November peak of $0.15. But perhaps more concerning is the fact that its 15% decline over the last 7 days has dragged it down below the 50-day moving average. Related Reading: What Ethereum’s Rejection At $1,350 Says About The Cryptocurrency DOGE’s 50-day MA is currently sitting at $0.086, whereas the price of the digital asset has now fallen to $0.082 in the last 24 hours. Previously, the cryptocurrency had been on a bullish path as it continued to maintain its value above this level. However, a decline below this point shows that there is now less buying in the market. The meme coin is continuing to maintain above its 100-day MA of $0.075 but this could also be short-lived if the sellers continue to gain momentum in the market. If the price were to fall below the 100-day MA, it would turn forecasts for the digital asset to sell not just for the medium term, but for the long term as well. DOGE price at $0.082 | Source: DOGEUSD on TradingView.com The Weekend Impact The weekend is already established as a period of low volatility. This is because while the crypto market does not see a close of the trading week, the close of the broader financial markets impacts the market as well. It leads to less volume and less momentum in the market. Related Reading: Whale Accumulation Paints Bullish Picture For XRP Given this, it is important for cryptocurrencies such as DOGE to finish strong on Friday if they are to maintain a bullish trend through the weekend. Otherwise, the impact of this low volume can push the prices further down. If DOGE is unable to beat the $0.09 resistance level before the end of Friday, then it could see the $0.07 territory before the weekend is over. There is not much support for the meme coin at this level, so bulls will likely have to build support around $0.065 to hold off the bears if this happens. However, if the digital asset can finish strong above $0.09, then there is the possibility of a rally above $0.1. DOGE was trading at $0.0826 at the time of this writing, according to data from Coinmarketcap. It is down 5.85% in the last 24 hours and 25.83% in the last seven days.

According to data from OpenSea, at time of writing, the collection’s trading volume is 900 ETH, or about $1.08 million. Its floor price is about 0.19 ETH, or about $230 – more than double the original price of $99.  Some tokens are selling for much higher prices. The one-of-ones, the rarest of the NFTs, which comprise 2.4% of the 45,000 unit collection (roughly 1,000), are selling for as much as 6 ETH at the time of writing.

Additionally, 115 customers purchased 45 NFTs, which is the minimum number of tokens that guarantees a ticket to a dinner with Trump; 17 people purchased 100 NFTs, which, according to the Trump Trading Card site, was the maximum quantity allowed to mint.

As of writing, the 9th top crypto has dropped 5% in the last seven days. In comparison, major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum lost over 4.5%, and Bitcoin shed 2% in the same timeframe. However, CoinMarketCap displays a rise in trade volume from $221,898,095 to $277,239,103, which represents an increase of over 25%. Nonetheless, as the price of ADA continues to decline, this could be the beginning of something else for Cardano. Macroeconomics At Play In response to persistently strong inflation in the United States, the Federal Reserve had to increase interest rates by 50 basis points, taking it from 4.25% to 4.50%. Despite the fact that inflation has been prevented from fully exploding since the Fed’s prior rate hikes, they still intend to boost interest rates to 5%, which could be a problem for Cardano investors.

This significant price decline suggests that the rumored Ethereum-killer might be losing its aggressiveness. Cardano’s TVL is only $71.05 million, compared to Ethereum’s $23.4 billion.

42388376,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qREgVX,1671200826,"DeFi Can Exacerbate Volatility Without Even Avoiding Middlemen, BIS Reports Say","Decentralized finance (DeFi) could lead to bumpier financial markets and may not even fix problems of large intermediaries dominating, two papers published Friday by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) said.  The papers put a damper on plans for trading to become fully automated – and for proposals to use new technology to cut out the middleman, including one proposed by FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried before his crypto exchange collapsed.  Regulators want to see financial markets that cushion shocks – for example, offering a form of insurance if there’s a spike in energy prices. But, a paper by Alfred Leharof the University of Calgary and Christine Parlour of the University of California Berkeley said, DeFi could have the opposite effect because liquidated loans depress collateral prices further.  “This contagion to other exchanges leads to negative feedback loops,” Leharof and Parlour said, after studying behavior on Aave and Compound, two major DeFi protocols. “Our findings illustrate a new form of systemic fragility arising from collateralised lending under DeFi architecture.”  While those platforms are different from the FTX plan, which was withdrawn on the day the exchange filed for bankruptcy protection, Bankman-Fried’s proposal “would immediately liquidate collateral through limit orders,” the authors said.  A separate BIS study also published Friday found DeFi could reduce the cost of financial transactions – but doesn’t fully fix the problems of centralized intermediaries overcharging for services, and can also circumvent checks.  “The current design of DeFi applications generates formidable challenges for tax enforcement, aggravates money laundering issues and other kinds of financial malfeasance,” said Igor Makarov of the London School of Economics and Antoinette Schoar of MIT's Sloan School of Management in a paper produced for the BIS.  “The economic forces that allow intermediaries to hold market power in traditional finance might still exist in the DeFi world,” added Makarov and Schoar, citing the examples of oracles – the links between smart contracts and the real world, which might be persuaded to collude and falsify data without the proper incentives.  It’s in the U.S. interest to “set standards that protect consumers and maintain the transparency, accountability and stability of the system,” but other jurisdictions need to play ball to stop business moving to the most favorable country, Makarov and Schoar said.  Without proper rules, regulatorswill be left depending on “goodwill and voluntary cooperation,” they added, or countries might each run their own versions of the blockchain.

Already in the last few days, rumors and FUD about Binance intensified. As NewsBTC reported, investors are worried that Binance is not keeping enough reserves on hand for all their client funds. The impetus for the outcry was a proof-of-reserves conducted by Mazars that raised numerous new questions instead of answering the old ones. Remarkably, the auditing firm worked not only with Binance but also with other cryptocurrency exchanges such as Crypto.com and KuCoin to attest to proof-of-reserves. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Prediction: Why BTC Could Still Tumble Below $16K An email to Binance now indicates that Mazars is pausing all work for crypto clients. “Unfortunately, this means that we will not be able to work with Mazars for the moment,” a Binance spokesperson said. Binance Rumors Are Dragging Down Market Sentiment The crypto market is not settling down after the collapse of FTX. Rumors of insufficient backing of client funds by Binance, Tether (USDT), and Digital Currency Group’s troubles as a result of Genesis Trading’s liquidity problems hang over the crypto market like a sword of Damocles. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao had tried to mitigate the turmoil several times in recent days. Thus, he took questions from the community in an AMA and appeared in an interview on CNBC. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miner Capitulation Is An Exaggerated Fear, Analyst Claims When asked if Binance would be able to pay out $2.1 billion if that amount was due. CZ said, “We are financially okay. We are financially strong.” The Binance CEO was also asked why the company has not yet disclosed its liabilities and whether the exchange plans to do so. CZ said: We are working with the audit firms to audit the financial liabilities. [..] Audits don’t reveal any problem. CNBC anchors interrupted CZ and made the claim that an audit by one of the Big Four could put all the rumors to rest. “When you say that some of them don’t want to work with you, that raises questions! They don’t want to work with you because you don’t have the documentation and data that would make them feel comfortable”, they said. CZ, for his part, refuted this statement and claimed that “actually many of them do not know how to audit crypto exchanges.” Binance CEO CZ on CNBC: Many big four firms do not know how to audit crypto exchanges. pic.twitter.com/r3C15cMwbK — unusual_whales (@unusual_whales) December 15, 2022 Bitcoin Price Plunges Below $17,000 The interview has in no way helped to calm the crypto market, especially since CZ was also unable to provide a satisfactory response via Twitter in the aftermath. CZ only retweeted the following and stated in his newest tweet that “Blockchains are public, permanent records. It’s the most auditable ledger.” The pausing of the collaboration with Mazars also puts the interview in a bad light. Mazars has not yet communicated why it has paused cooperation with Binance and the other crypto exchanges, other than that the term “audit” would be used falsely. Bitcoin investors have taken the interview overwhelmingly bearish.

Litecoin Drops Hard TodayS But Is Up 20% In The Last Month While the rest of the crypto market was struggling, LTC enjoyed some sharp bullish momentum in the third leg of November, leading some to believe the “pre-halving rally” had begun for the crypto. But the first half of December proved disappointing as the coin mostly consolidated, and now in the last two days, the trend seems to have completely reversed as Litecoin has been rapidly going down instead. At the time of writing, LTC is trading around $69, down 7% in the last 24 hours. The below chart shows how the asset’s price has changed in recent months. The rise in the coin's value during the last three months | Source: LTCUSD on TradingView As the graph displays, Litecoin was initially on the way up in early November and crossed $70. But then the FTX crash struck the market, and the coin’s price plummeted to a low of less than $50. However, unlike other big cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, LTC quickly found its feet and started on a steady recovery. In the third part of November, the coin rapidly blew up and shattered the peak seen just before the FTX debacle, ending the month in double-digit gains while the rest of the sector was deep in the red. Related Reading: Why This Bitcoin Bearish Divergence Could Spell Doom For BTC Rally LTC was consolidating this month after setting a peak above $80, but holders were optimistic as the coin’s halving, an event where block production would be cut in half, is scheduled to take place next year. Historically, halvings have usually had a bullish effect on the prices of cryptocurrencies due to supply-demand dynamics, as supply production is reduced by 50% following them.

42388379,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qREgoF,1671197169,First Mover Americas: Crypto Auditing Hits Snag,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Top Stories  Binance’s proof-of-reserves auditor Mazars has paused all work for its crypto clients, Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange by trading volume, said in an emailed statement. ""Mazars has indicated that they will temporarily pause their work with all of their crypto clients globally, which include Crypto.com, KuCoin and Binance. Unfortunately, this means that we will not be able to work with Mazars for the moment,"" a Binance spokesperson said. The accounting firm performed a proof-of-reserves assessment of Binance earlier this month, finding its bitcoin reserves were overcollateralized. Bitcoin coin (BNB) fell after the announcement. It has lost about 5% in the past 24 hours, CoinDesk data shows.  FTX, the crypto exchange that filed for bankruptcy last month, wants to sell its functioning units, including its U.S.-based derivatives wing LedgerX. On Thursday, the exchange petitioned a U.S. bankruptcy court for permission to sell several subsidiaries, including FTX Japan, FTX Europe and Embed Business. ""Based on their preliminary review, the debtors own or control a number of subsidiaries and assets that are regulated, licensed and/or largely not integrated into the debtors’ operations, within and outside of the United States,"" the filing said. ""The debtors believe a number of these entities have solvent balance sheets, independent management and valuable franchises.""  Crypto trading firm Amber Group changed its fundraising strategy to raise $300 million in a Series C round, as a reaction to the fall of FTX. The collapse of the exchange affected some of Amber’s products and customers, increasing the need to raise capital quickly. Amber decided to move from its efforts to raise a Series B+ round at a $3 billion valuation in favor of a Series C. ""Post the FTX collapse, we paused [the series B+ fundraise] after a partial closing and instead moved forward on Series C,"" the firm said.  Bitcoin (BTC) was down 4% to just below $17,000 early Friday Eastern time, and ether (ETH) dropped 6% to $1,212 as more bad news in the crypto world keeps coming forth. U.S. stock futures also pointed down after the Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 764 points on Thursday on recession fears.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows daily trading volume in bitcoin and ether futures markets since December 2020.  Trading activity has slowed to levels last seen roughly two years ago, representing the impact of global liquidity tightening and widespread deleveraging and contagion from the collapse of several industry bigwigs, including Terra, Three Arrows Capital and FTX.  The exodus of leverage traders means less speculation, which is perhaps a positive development in the eyes of those averse to the cryptocurrencies' high volatility. It's not great for liquidity, however.  – Omkar Godbole  Trending Posts  Crypto.com Receives License as a Payment Institution in Brazil  Changpeng Zhao Won't Rescue Binance by Selling out Crypto Self-Custody  Crypto Exchange Gemini Back Online After Being Down for Over Seven Hours",NEGATIVE,BTC | BNB,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,"Lyllah Ledesma, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/12/16/first-mover-americas-crypto-auditing-hits-snag,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b809e903b20dd26de1240800f8539bcb475389ca-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Prices for Bitcoin and Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies fell on December 14 as reports surfaced that the central bank raised its interest rates. The situation is different now, though. CoinGecko reports that the token dropped another 5% today, with significant declines over the past week, biweekly, and monthly periods. SOL price is currently 135% lower than its intrinsic value.

SOL Change In Public Opinion The futures market for SOL coin indicates a positive investment rate from yesterday, confirming the optimistic tone of on-chain analytics. However, it soon turned negative, reflecting a change in public opinion regarding SOL. Speculation may be to blame for the recent price increase of the altcoin and subsequent price drop, as is normal with most cryptos. The current support at $13.38 is important because the market is already factoring in the central bank’s interest rate hike. Even if there is news of greater institutional interest in crypto and blockchain technology, the broader crypto market will be dragged down if big cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH continue to suffer.

Positively, even though FTX and Solana are tightly intertwined because of Alameda, the ecosystem has continued to implement technical advancements centered on the key pillars of Solana, namely speed and scalability. According to the overview, Solana’s DeFi space has been severely damaged. However, the environment is not dead. The study indicates that there are numerous applications on Solana, despite the fact that the TVL has decreased by a staggering 70% since the FTX disaster.

However, investors in SOL should be wary of short- and medium-term losses, as the rising correlation between the token and BTC and ETH could render Messari’s research bearish.

Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency by market value, fell 2% to $16,950, extending a retreat from the one-month high of $18,300 reached Wednesday. Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, fell 4.3% to $1,210, hitting the lowest since Nov. 29, CoinDesk data shows.  Binance's BNB fell over 3% to $247, a level last seen on Sept. 26, and other major coins including XRP, LTC, and SOL registered similar losses.  Mazars discontinued its veritas.mazars.com website dedicated to crypto audits in a move that probably highlights the prevailing discomfort among traditional institutions to associate with crypto projects.  ""Overnight crypto dump courtesy of Mazars and Binance worries,"" trader and analyst Alex Kruger tweeted.  Early this month, Mazars published Binance's proof-of-reserves report, showing the giant exchange's bitcoin reserves were overcollateralized. The report, however, did not provide details about the internal controls in Binance's margin and loan products, raising doubts about the exchange's health.  Binance saw customer withdrawals worth several hundred million dollars as investors scrambled to take direct custody of their coins.  Several observers have dismissed the uncertainty surrounding Binance as coordinated FUD, a crypto slang for fear, uncertainty and doubt.  ""Paid lobbyists and spokespersons are carrying SBF's voice and torch while he tries to change the narrative of the misappropriation of customer funds. As those attempts have been largely discredited, the attacks on Binance have intensified,"" Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at Matrixport, wrote in a note to clients on Friday, referring to Sam Bankman-Fried, the former CEO of the FTX exchange.  Risk-off  Investors in traditional markets sold risk, driving the U.S. stock futures lower and adding to the crypto market's woes as early this week, major central banks, including the Federal Reserve, pushed back against expectations for an early pivot to liquidity easing.  At press time, the futures tied to the S&P 500 traded 1% lower, signaling a possible extension of Thursday's 2.5% slide.  The U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday said that while rate hikes could slow, more liquidity tightening is needed to control inflation, forcing markets to reassess expectations for rate cuts in the second half of 2023.  The European Central Bank said it will raise interest rates ""significantly"" in the months ahead to combat entrenched inflation.

The document was sent to creditors Thursday and said the assets included $37 million in fiat money, tokens worth about $238 million, non-fungible tokens (NFT) worth around $22 million and venture and other investments valued at $502 million.  ""Due to volatility in the crypto market generally, together with the substantial number of illiquid investments held by the company, it is presently uncertain what level of recoveries will be made during the course of the liquidation,"" Teneo wrote, according to the report.  The $1 billion in assets is dwarfed by Three Arrows Capital's liabilities, which stood at over $3 billion.  Teneo was appointed to handle the liquidation of 3AC by the High Court in the hedge fund's native Singapore, having been initially ordered in a British Virgin Islands court. Earlier this month Teneo seized $35.6 million from the firm's bank accounts to go with $2.8 million recovered from forced redemption of investments and an unspecified number of tokens and NFTs.  The collapse of 3AC following heavy losses amid declining cryptocurrency valuations was one of the focal points on the onset of the crypto winter in recent months.

5722011,https://newsbtc.com/?p=512623,1671193200,"Bitcoin Miner Capitulation Is An Exaggerated Fear, Analyst Claims","Jaran Mellerud of Hashrate Index recently released a ‘comprehensive analysis’ on the thesis that a Bitcoin miner capitulation could put massive selling pressure on the market, causing a crash. The topic has been a recurring part of the discussion in recent weeks as to whether the BTC bear market could be prolonged by the tight mining industry. Charles Edwards of Capriole Investments stated two weeks ago that miner capitulation has begun, as indicated by hash ribbons. Investment giant VanEck also recently published an analysis that the bear market could extend into the second quarter of 2023 due to miner capitulation. The company predicted that BTC could bottom at $10,000 to $12,000 in Q1 2023. Mellerud counters this assumption by saying that the miners’ total BTC holdings are not significant enough to move the spot market. Are Bitcoin Miners Not As Powerful As Believed? The Hashrate Index analyst writes that all miners must collectively own a significant portion of the circulating supply to have a meaningful impact. However, the question of the number of their holdings is a great mystery, although estimates do exist. On-chain data providers such as CoinMetrics and Glassnode provide the best-known guesses, by grouping wallet addresses according to their proximity to the Coinbase transaction. Mellerud claims that these numbers likely significantly overestimate miners’ Bitcoin holdings. CoinMetrics estimates 820,000 BTC for all miners worldwide. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Prediction: Why BTC Could Still Tumble Below $16K Another possibility is to derive the number from the Bitcoin holdings of public miners. Using these figures, Mellerud estimates 470,000 Bitcoin. With 19.2 million BTC currently in circulation, miners thus hold only between 2% and 4%. “The public’s image of miners as enormous bitcoin holders and influential market participants might have been accurate ten years ago . Times have changed, and miners no longer hold a meaningful share of the Bitcoin supply,” Mellerud claims. BTC Holdings By Miners Vs. Spot Volume However, in terms of potential selling pressure, it is also important to know the size of the spot market to find out how well the market can absorb the selling pressure. According to Mellerud, the best way to estimate the absolute selling pressure of miners is to look at how much BTC they receive each day. Generally speaking, about 900 freshly minted Bitcoins flow into miners’ wallets every day. When miners sell less than 100% of their production, they accumulate Bitcoin; when they sell more than 100%, they reduce their holdings. The chart below shows that Bitcoin sales by miners peaked in June when they sold 350% of their production. For the rest of the year, the rate was 150% at maximum. Using Binance spot volume, Mellerud shows in the chart below that a selling pressure of 100% of the production accounts for only 0.2% of the spot volume. At 200%, it represents only 0.4%, and at 300%, it is still only 0.6% of the total volume. Mellerud concludes: Due to the small share of Bitcoin miners’ hypothetical volume compared to Bitcoin’s total spot volume, we see that Bitcoin should have more than enough liquidity in its spot market to accommodate the selling pressure from miners. In a worst-case scenario by Mellerud, in which all miners dump their entire holdings within 30 days (equally distributed over all days), the selling pressure of 470,000 BTC (4,900 BTC per day) would only amount to 1% of the total spot volume.

42388374,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qREgaD,1671185796,Bitcoin Few Weeks Away From Its First Weekly Chart 'Death Cross',"Things could soon go from bad to worse for bitcoin (BTC) traders looking for bullish cues on technical charts.  The cryptocurrency's 50-week simple moving average (SMA) is falling fast and looks set to cross below the 200-week SMA for the first time on record.  According to technical analysis theory, the bearish intersection of the two averages, often referred to as the ""death cross,"" means the market is about to head into a tailspin.  Bitcoin has dropped 75% since reaching a record high of $69,000 in November of last year. The bear market has proved to be more intense than the previous ones during which sellers failed to establish a foothold under the 200-day SMA.  Critics of technical analysis would point out that the death cross, irrespective of whether it occurs on the daily or weekly charts, is a lagging indicator and unreliable. That's largely true, as the indicator is based on backward-looking moving averages and reflects the asset's past performance.  The death cross has a bad reputation for trapping sellers on the wrong side of the market in traditional finance. And it has done so to bitcoin traders in the past. For instance, the daily chart death cross of March 2020 marked a major price bottom.  Seasoned traders, therefore, read the death cross in conjunction with other chart factors and fundamental indicators, which are split on the next possible move in bitcoin.  Per Delphi Digital, bitcoin's sideways trading in the range of $16,500 to $17,300 in the aftermath of FTX's collapse offers little hope to the bulls.  ""We still believe this area does not have much structural support, and in the face of further contagion and uncertainty, we remain cautious as we watch the $9k-13k level,"" Delphi's strategists, led by Andrew Krohn, wrote in a note to clients.  Several miners or those responsible for minting coins are likely to go bankrupt in the first half of next year, pushing bitcoin to $12,000 and below. Add to that the U.S. Federal Reserve's persistent anti-stimulus bias and the path of least resistance appears to be on the downside.  That said, in the past, bitcoin has bottomed out to begin a new rally 15 months ahead of the mining reward halving, a programmed 50% reduction in the pace of supply expansion every four years.  The next bitcoin halving is due in March/April 2024. If history is a guide, the bitcoin bear market may have ended in November at $15,473 and the cryptocurrency could rally as high as $63,000 ahead of the halving.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/12/16/bitcoin-few-weeks-away-from-its-first-weekly-chart-death-cross,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/62f61ed6d33d6e4f3705ab0a9be4ad639221210d-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Mazars said in an emailed statement that it had paused only its crypto work relating to proof-of-reserves reports. ""This is due to concerns regarding the way these reports are understood by the public,"" the company said.  Mazars added that proof-of reserve reports ""do not constitute either an assurance or an audit opinion on subject matter. Instead they report limited findings based on the agreed procedures performed on the subject matter at a historical point in time.""  The accounting firm performed a proof-of-reserves assessment of Binance earlier this month, finding its bitcoin reserves were overcollateralized.  The auditor also found that Kucoin's BTC, ETH, USDT and USDC reserves were all overcollateralized. Mazars' assessment of Crypto.com's reserves found them to be fully backed 1:1.  Mazars' reports on Binance and KuCoin were removed from its website, though they are available online at SilverSixpence, which assisted in their production.

Lawmakers in the bloc reckon the technology underpinning crypto could cut out middlemen when trading financial instruments such as stocks, bonds and other securities, but there have been concerns about whether regular retail investors will be able to access the benefits in practice, especially as they’ll need to take a test first.  When users of the platform are regular people, rather than, say, an investment bank, “the applicant should clearly indicate to the [national competent authority] for its assessment what are the experiences (e.g., through its education, training, professional experience, etc.) which demonstrate a sufficient level of knowledge of the functioning of the DLT technology,” said the guidance, published Thursday, referring to distributed ledger technology.  There have been worries that hurdle could prove a deterrent to using DLT as opposed to existing ways of accessing financial markets, especially if each EU country does it differently, CoinDesk has been previously told.  The guidance from the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) isn’t binding, but national authorities will need to explain any decision not to follow it. Though they take effect in March, alongside the rest of the rule changes, “applicants are strongly encouraged to anticipate the formal entry into force of the guidelines,” ESMA said.  In principle, the new regime is open to existing markets and new entrants. Comments on the draft were received from companies representing investment firms, trading venues, and securities depositories, ESMA said.

These products expose investors to the crypto market without owning the underlying asset. Investing in ETFs allows users to enjoy institutional custody and transparent and simplified trading through brokerage accounts. Related Reading: What Ethereum’s Rejection At $1,350 Says About The Cryptocurrency Crypto assets are highly volatile, with complex trading rudiments. Therefore most investors find it more comfortable investing in ETFs as they protect them from direct exposure to risks in digital asset trading. Due to these benefits, crypto exchange-traded products have gained more traction. In a press release, CSOP revealed that its Bitcoin Futures ETF bagged $53.8 million, while the Ether Futures ETF got $19.7 million in initial investments. As per the report, the $73.6 million is for the firm’s listing in the Hong Kong stock exchange holding. The two ETFs will be invested in Bitcoin and Ethereum futures listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to follow the asset prices. Tim McCourt, an executive at CME Group, commented on the development. According to him, the ETFs listing indicates the increasing demand for Bitcoin and Ether exposure. McCourt noted that introducing the funds may open new opportunities for institutional and retail investors. ETFs Are Safer Than Trading Crypto Assets, Says Yi Wang In an interview with Reuters, Yi Wang, an executive at CSOP, gave his statement regarding the ETFs. Wang said the ETFs are safer than trading digital assets on unregulated platforms. He believes the ETFs are more secure since they do not invest in physical Bitcoin and trade on regulated US and Hong Kong exchanges. Wang noted that the development of the two ETFs shows that Hong Kong is open to virtual asset innovations despite the liquidity issues on some digital exchanges. Previously on Oct. 31, 2022, the Hong Kong regulator, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), said it would allow Bitcoin and Ether futures ETFs listings. In a notice, the SFC stated rules that will guide ETF issuers. The guidelines include having a good track record and three years of experience in ETF management.

The round was led by Fenbushi Capital U.S., and other crypto investors and family offices, the firm said on Twitter. Singapore's investment fund Temasek, heavyweight venture capital firm Sequoia Capital China and Coinbase Ventures have previously invested in Amber Group, according to information platform Crunchbase.  While less than 10% of Amber Group's trading capital was with the defunct FTX when it imploded, there were certain products that ""would have experienced significant drawdowns as an aftermath of the FTX default"" unless they could find better ways to protect customers, the trading firm tweeted on Friday.  The trading firm decided to move from its efforts to raise a Series B+ round at a $3 billion valuation in favor of a Series C. ""Post the FTX collapse, we paused [the series B+ fundraise] after a partial closing and instead moved forward on Series C,"" Amber Group said.  The trading firm had reportedly laid off 40% of its staff, 300 employees, restricted employee benefits and terminated a $25 million sponsorship deal with Chelsea Football Club, following the FTX collapse.  In the tweet thread announcing the fundraise, Amber Group admitted that it had to ""say goodbye"" to ""many"" colleagues as it decided to scale down ""mass consumer efforts and non-essential business lines."" The Series C investors ""came on board"" understanding that the firm would be ""laser-focused.""  As the layoffs were announced, Amber Group was also spending. The crypto trader reportedly bought a Singapore-regulated crypto platform.  The bankruptcy of crypto exchange FTX has spread through the industry, exacerbating an already bleak market.

In a document filed to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of Delaware, attorneys for FTX said it was a priority for the company's current management to ""explore"" the sale or find other strategic transactions for certain subsidiaries.  ""Based on their preliminary review, the Debtors own or control a number of subsidiaries and assets that are regulated, licensed and/or largely not integrated into the Debtors’ operations, within and outside of the United States,"" the filing said. ""The Debtors believe a number of these entities have solvent balance sheets, independent management and valuable franchises.""  These units include LedgerX, which also did business as FTX US Derivatives, FTX Japan, FTX Europe and Embed Business.  Most of these entities were acquired by FTX relatively recently, meaning they operated largely independently of their global parent. As such, their assets and funds remain segregated from FTX, unlike some of the company's other subsidiaries.  In congressional testimony, FTX's new CEO, John Ray III, said that even companies purportedly segregated from FTX like FTX US were not actually independent.  FTX filed for bankruptcy last month, saying in filings it had over $10 billion in liabilities.  ‘Dozens’ of bids  FTX wants to sell these units quickly, the filing said. Many have had their operating licenses suspended since FTX itself filed for bankruptcy.  ""The Debtors and/or the Businesses have been in active conversations with a number of regulators for the Businesses,"" the filing said. ""The licenses held by FTX Europe have been suspended along with its operations, and FTX Japan is subject to business suspension and business improvement orders. The longer operations are suspended, the greater the risk to the value of the assets and the risk of a permanent revocation of licenses.""  FTX has already received ""dozens of unsolicited"" – more than 100 – bids for the companies, the filing said. If the sales are approved, interested parties could bid for the different units, the filing said, suggesting possible bid dates for the various entities ranging from February to March. Preliminary bid dates stretch from mid-January to early February.  By these dates, aspiring purchasers would have to submit various documents verifying both their interest and their ability to bid for the businesses at auction.  Bidders will also need to verify their ability to secure regulatory approval for the sales.  If a would-be bidder navigates these hurdles, FTX would request hearings in March in front of the bankruptcy court.  Approving these sales would benefit FTX's creditors, the filing said.
