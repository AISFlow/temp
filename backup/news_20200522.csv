This episode is sponsored by ErisX, The Stellar Development Foundation and Grayscale Digital Large Cap Investment Fund.      On Wednesday, a batch of coins mined just a month after bitcoin’s birth were moved. It was the first time since August 2017 that any bitcoin from early 2009 had been transferred, and the action set Bitcoin Twitter on fire. While a number of bitcoin archaeologists quickly and persuasively argued the tokens were almost assuredly not mined by bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto, it was a moment that reinforced the living history in the bitcoin ecosystem.      See also: 9 Reasons Why Bitcoin Has Never Been Stronger Going Into a Halving      In this episode, NLW looks at what makes the Satoshi mythology powerful:    Genuine technical innovation and problem solving that had stymied some brilliant minds for decades  Incredible instincts around narrative and human psychology, as reflected in the “Chancellor on the Brink” message embedded in the Genesis Block and the ceremony around the halving  The incredible contrariness of a creator withdrawing in a world where entrepreneurs are lionized like no one else in society    And while the battles within the bitcoin community around interpretation may look more like the early history of religions than like a business ecosystem, NLW argues that fervor is a key part of what de-risks bitcoin, even for investors who don’t at all care about the mythology.

Sponsored by state Rep. Mark Wright (R-77), HB701 sailed through the state House of Representatives with unanimous approval, and is being referred to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Consumer Protection and International Affairs.      If passed, the legislation would establish Louisiana’s first crypto licensing regime.      Crypto businesses would have to apply with the state’s Office of Financial Institutions (OFI), fork over executives’ fingerprints, subject their “experience, character and general fitness” to investigation – and perhaps the business premises as well – and pay a nonrefundable registration fee, among other requirements.      Registrants licensed by states with comparable regimes would not need a Louisiana license under the bill. Individuals dealing with less than $35,000 annually would only need to register with OFI.      OFI projected charging a $2,000 application fee and $1,000 for annual renewal. Louisiana’s budget gurus estimated the bill would cost the agency nearly $150,000 in its first year and about $1.3 million over five as OFI ramped up enforcement.      Bill sponsor Rep. Wright first called upon the OFI to study virtual currency regulation in 2019, according to The Advocate. During that session, he also introduced a different crypto licensing bill.      That bill died in the House committee.    Source law    Andrew Hinkes, a lawyer with Carlton Fields, said the 2020 bill appears to derive from the Virtual Currency Business Act (VCBA), a licensure regime by the non-partisan Uniform Law Commission (ULC).      ULC drafts model laws meant to bring statutory uniformity across state lines. California, Oklahoma and Hawaii are all considering versions of the VCBA, he said.      See also: The Uniform Law Commission Has Given States a Clear Path to Approach Bitcoin      “The ULC releases model laws which sometimes are quickly adopted by multiple states and sometimes are not adopted at all,"" he said. ""State legislatures ultimately make policy decisions for their states and decide whether model laws are appropriate.”      The 23-page bill has 'significant' differences from the ULC’s 50+ page VCBA. Hinkes said it does not include reporting requirements, enforcement mechanisms, compliance programs and consumer protections that the VCBA put forth.      Rep. Wright did not immediately return a request for comment.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | REGULATION,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/22/louisiana-state-senate-to-consider-crypto-business-licensing-bill,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a63e812349277849d22979744c219fc687c53681-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Top Shelf      Iranian Crypto Mining Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has ordered the the Central Bank of Iran (CBI), energy department and information and communication technology ministries to draft a renewed national strategy for the crypto mining industry. The news comes days after the Iranian parliament published a bill proposing to apply the country’s strict foreign exchange and currency smuggling regulation to cryptocurrencies. It’s unclear why the nation’s crypto policies are being revisited, though some speculate its to prevent value from escaping the nation’s borders.      Tough Drafts Harsh new rules making many uses of digital assets punishable with fines or prison might soon become law in Russia. Two draft bills setting out how Russia should regulate cryptocurrencies were sent to the country’s parliament, the State Duma, earlier this week. The first of which would prohibit the issuance and transaction of digital currencies in the nation, while the second would impose new sanctions for the illegal use of digital assets. The draft bills have not been finalized, according a high ranking official at the Duma.      Quarterly Loss Canaan has reported a net loss of $5.6 million and shrinking cash reserves for the first quarter of 2020. Revenues are up 44% quarter over quarter after the firm slashed prices, but it also incurred $9.3 million and $5.9 million expenses in cost of goods sold and R&D, respectively. Canaan’s next generation miners will hit shelves next quarter, though the firm has not provided a business outlook citing the uncertainties of the COVID-19 pandemic and the post-Bitcoin halving.      Libra-like Stablecoin Top Chinese political advisers have proposed a regional digital currency to facilitate regional trade that would be backed by four major Asian currencies including the Japanese yen, Korean won, Hong Kong dollar and the yuan, with the People’s Bank of China leading the proposed effort. The basket of underlying collateral would be weighted based on its nation’s economy, resembling the original vision for Facebook’s libra.      Next of Kin    The kin cryptocurrency may leave its own fork of Stellar for the Solana blockchain. ""The fork of Stellar enabled Kin to reach millions of consumers, but we knew it would not be a long-term solution,"" a draft Kin Improvement Proposal reads. ""Stellar has five-second block times, so irrespective of network load, a consumer could be seeing five-second latency on their transactions – not what we would deem a great consumer experience."" The draft proposal claims switching to Solana would lead to an 84% reduction in kin's latency.  The Kin Foundation published a transparency report Thursday, laying out its structure and operations, in a partnership with Messari and its disclosure database. Notably, 28 million users have acquired kin in the last three years across more than 50 different apps, and are spending 300 million kin per day, the report claims. The foundation’s tokens are vested at a rate of 20% per year.    Blockchain Bill of Rights The World Economic Forum revealed a “blockchain bill of rights” to protect a crypto user’s right to “manage consent of data stored in third-party systems, port data between interoperable systems” and “revoke consent for future data collection.” Called the Presidio Principles, the document includes signatories from the Government of Colombia, Deloitte, ConsenSys, Electric Coin Company, CoinShares and the United Nations’ World Food Program, just to name a few.      Breadcrumbs... Anchorage now has six executives in its C-suite, hiring a head of finance and head of sales with experience in both tech and Wall Street. With the new hires, this will be the first time the custodian has employees with “this deep of a bench” running the sales and finance sides of the business, President Diogo Mónica said. “It’s pretty obvious that Anchorage has larger ambitions than its current set of services,” he said. “I think you can start following the breadcrumbs.”      ADAM Hires Blockinger ADAM, a 15-member crypto trade group, hired Jeffrey Blockinger, a former hedge fund legal chief, as its first chief executive. The agency write codes of conduct for the industry. ""I look forward to expanding our leadership role in shaping the future of the digital assets markets by building consensus for the entire industry,"" Blockinger said in a statement.

And those different forms of crypto will most likely trade at different prices,” said Bakkt President Adam White at Consensus: Distributed. Other commenters noted that the rule could lead to increased use of privacy coins and regulatory arbitrage between nations that choose to turn a blind eye on exchanges ignoring this global standard.      Finance and the Real Economy Can’t Stay Out of Sync Forever Jill Carlson, co-founder of the Open Money Initiative, argues the imbalance between stock prices, spurred by Federal stimuli, and record-levels of unemployment will rectify sooner than later. “[W]hen I look at the impacts of COVID-19, I see as much slowing down or creaking to a halt as I see speeding up. Our way of life has slowed. Economic time has stopped. For now, financial time has carried on. But there is good reason to think that may slow soon, too, as we realize our spendthrift habits don’t always serve us well,” she said.    The Breakdown    ‘Dismantle the Euro to Save Europe’ Feat.

42431963,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN8FBh,1590160500,"Money Reimagined: Designer Money for a Machine-Run, Post-COVID World","A headline in the MIT Technology Review caught my attention this week: “The pandemic is emptying call centers. AI chatbots are swooping in.”      COVID-19’s perfect storm – a global public health crisis, an economic meltdown and a surge in online connectivity – could accelerate what World Economic Forum founder Klaus Schwab calls the Fourth Industrial Revolution. In creating imperatives for both cost-cutting and software-dependent innovation, the pandemic is bringing us closer to an economy dominated by integrated networks of digital devices.      This raises all sorts of vital questions, but here we’ll just drill down into one: What kind of money will this new society need?      It’s likely long-term unemployment will be a defining condition of this emerging machine-dominant economy. We’re not just talking about cyclical, recessionary layoffs but net job losses that are structural and permanent.      You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk’s newsletters here.      If so, the situation could confirm the so-called “end of work” thesis, which foresees new technologies leaving employers with an ever-declining need for human labor. It proved largely unfounded during the 20th century, as each fresh technological wave created new jobs that offset the old ones. But the thesis is gaining weight again in response to a new, self-advancing phase in computer technology. Machine-learning algorithms mean our periodic competitions with new technologies are no longer one-off events. Humans are now engaged in an endless battle with computers that are constantly getting smarter. As machines acquire the very cognitive and creative skills that previously allowed us to reinvent our employment opportunities, the battle may be unwinnable.    UBI’s moment    If we are indeed approaching the end of work, expect a surge of interest in universal basic income.      UBI is the idea that the government should pay a basic living wage to all citizens. It has been thrust into public consciousness by COVID-19 and the sudden, massive expansion in unemployment that came with it – 36 million alone in the U.S. On Thursday, its advocates got a boost when Twitter founder Jack Dorsey announced a $5 million donation to former Presidential candidate Andrew Yang’s Humanity Forward nonprofit, which is using $250 microgrants to make the case for UBI.      We don’t have space here for a deep debate about UBI. Just please don’t narrow-mindedly reject it as “socialism.” UBI backers range from liberals who want to expand public safety nets to conservatives who see potential to reform inefficient and highly politicized welfare distribution. Others see UBI as correcting for the power of Big Tech by redistributing revenue gained through personal data mining. The system should compensate them for those vital resources.      If UBI is to be part of our new digital economy it would seem logical to make it digital, too.      We’ve already seen U.S. lawmakers propose that, rather than mailing out checks for COVID-19 relief, funds should be sent directly as digital dollars via special Federal Reserve wallets. The proposal didn’t pass, but having central banks establish a digital currency for social distribution payments is, remarkably, now a mainstream topic.      There are clear benefits to digitizing UBI: Direct-to-consumer payments could improve efficiency, prevent confiscation by middlemen, create parity for the “unbanked” and, provided the rollout goes smoothly, legitimize the direct connection between a government and its people. Programmability could also allow authorities to constrain how the funds are used. Software designs could, say, allow supermarkets or landlords to accept the funds, but not barmen. (To be sure, this is inconsistent with the spirit of pure UBI, but it would likely to resonate with some politicians.)      On the other hand, as European Central Bank executive board member Yves Mersch noted in a presentation to Consensus Distributed last week, citizens could see their civil rights undermined if central banks don’t build privacy protections into direct-to-consumer digital currency accounts.      With this infrastructure, central banks could directly manipulate the value of people’s personal money, creating a more powerful mechanism for managing consumer spending and inflation than the current solution, which relies on banks and financial markets as indirect conduits for monetary policy. Whether you think that’s a good thing depends on how you feel about central banks’ being empowered to manipulate the value of money to manage economic conditions.      Another challenging issue is that involving central banks in governments’ fiscal distributions may make their economic policymaking dependent on political interests. That would be a radical departure from the independence principles upon which central banking has been founded for the past four decades. It might make central bankers more accountable to the public interest because their actions would have a direct impact on voters’ pocketbooks. But they could also be forced to pursue the self interests of politicians.      You get the idea: Inevitable or not, digital currency-based UBI brings many complications.    Machine money    I hate to say this, but we humans aren’t the only constituents in the Fourth Industrial Revolution. We must also consider the interests of the digital machines.      As social distancing becomes normalized, expect cities to ease ordinances on things like delivery robots, self-driving taxis and other autonomous devices. Next, expect urban planners to draw up sweeping blueprints for smart cities that combine the data generated by such devices with network-driven dynamic pricing so that everything from traffic flows to renewable energy sharing can be managed in a self-correcting system.      To optimize such systems, devices owned by different individuals and companies would be given autonomy to interact and exchange data, goods and valuable services, and to receive, hold and send digital, programmable money as standalone entities. For this to happen, the system’s unit of value, its currency, must function as a digital token exchanged peer-to-peer – in this case, machine-to-machine – without the interference of a banking intermediary. Whether such a system would use central bank digital currencies, stablecoins, native blockchain tokens like bitcoin, or all three is yet to be determined.      China is surging ahead with such a model, incorporating its Digital Currency Electronic Payment system, or DCEP, into a network of smart cities that deploy tools provided by the national Blockchain Services Network. In due time, the efficiencies China extracts from that will put competitive pressure on Western countries to follow suit.      When that happens, we must ensure optimizing such systems doesn’t compromise the interests of those they are supposed to serve.      The money of the future can serve the interests of machines, but only if they align with the interests of us humans.    How to scale blockchains? Ask the internet    You know how it is: Life in lockdown has you staring constantly at a screen. Not just 9-to-5, but always. Almost every single human interaction outside of your immediate family and almost every commercial transaction you make is done online. And how many more hours of streaming videos are watching?      So, how much more busy is the internet these days?      John Graham-Cumming, the chief technology officer of Cloudflare, answered that question by treating the traffic flowing through his network security company’s systems as a proxy for overall usage. Sure enough, global traffic is up 40% on the year, as per the chart above that Cloudfare provided us. In a blog post addressing earlier data last month, Graham-Cumming highlighted what this says about the resilience of the internet, which has had no real interruptions despite the surging usage. “Overall the Internet has shown that it was built for this: designed to handle huge changes in traffic, outages and a changing mix of use,” he wrote.      There are lessons here for blockchains. To scale them, look to the layered design of the internet. The base layer protocol, known as TCP/IP, is sometimes described as a one trick pony. It only does data switching, but it does it really well. The single task design means it can deal with the challenges of heavy traffic. All the other functionality of the internet – email, websites, file transfer, etc. – isn’t forced on that main load-bearing system but enabled by higher level open protocols such as SMTP and HTTP, and then by proprietary applications even further “up the stack.” It’s relevant to the bitcoin versus ethereum debate, with the latter more sophisticated, multifaceted and powerful for running things like smart contracts but, according to its critics, entailing a complexity that makes it more prone to breakdowns and security breaches.    The global town hall    $91 million. That’s the current value of the 10,000 bitcoin Laszlo Hanyecz gave up to purchase two pizzas on this day 10 years ago. It was the first time bitcoin was spent on a good or service, giving the event canonical relevance in the cryptocurrency’s history. Ever since, it has been memorialized on this date as “Bitcoin Pizza Day.” The outside world tends to focus on the massive fortune Hanyecz left on the table by not “HODLing” his bitcoin, which after exchanging them for $25 worth of pizza were valued at a mere quarter of a cent at the time. He tends to respond with a shrug, arguing that he did something to help legitimize bitcoin. And, indeed, his act helped set off a price rally that has continued to today. But Hanyecz’s pizza order is also important for the value it ascribed to bitcoin for its utility as a payment vehicle. Hanyecz has continued to take an interest in initiatives to help make bitcoin more usable for payments, even as the narrative has shifted toward its value proposition as “digital gold.” Two years ago on this day he made a point by using the Lightning Network, which seeks to make bitcoin transactions more efficient and viable for low-value transactions, to make a certain, iconic purchase: a pizza.      The Fed is “not out of ammunition by a long shot.” So said the man in charge of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, in a gloomy interview on CBS 60 Minutes last Sunday. Markets rallied in response, which should have left heads scratching. I mean, of course, the Fed has loads more ammunition left – it has unlimited printing power. The question is whether that ammunition is effective. Is it firing blanks? The bigger risk is that the real limit to its effective power won’t reveal itself until some indeterminate time in the future, when it’s too late. But at some point – after the Fed has flooded trillions of dollars into markets, after it has acquired huge swaths of corporate debt to find itself politically compromised, after it has restored the wealth of hedge funds but has left ordinary Americans living hand to mouth – confidence in the dollar will disappear. At that moment, everyone will finally realize that the ammunition was useless all along.      Martin Wolf, chief economics commentator at the Financial Times, is one of the most influential financial journalists of all time. So when an article of his comes out with the title “Why inflation might follow the pandemic” it’s time to sit up and take notice. The headline suggested a countervailing view to that of the economic mainstream, with its persistent argument that the demand contraction from the COVID-19 crisis will produce long-lasting deflation. But if you’re expecting this to align with the forecasts of those in the crypto community who believe the central banks’ aggressive stimulus will result in debased money and hyperinflation, think again. Wolf puts all the variables on the table – huge government debt ratios, rapidly expanding broad money supply measures potentially offset by a slowing money velocity, and the end of the disinflationary effect of globalization – to argue, that inflation might finally return, but also might not. Bottom line: we live in chartered territory. No one really knows.

Startup founders do this calculus whenever they raise capital. Ten years ago today, a developer named Laszlo Hanyecz did it with bitcoin.  Hanyecz is known as the first person to use bitcoin in a commercial transaction. On May 22, 2010, when bitcoin was a little over a year old, he bought two pizzas for 10,000 BTC. The day is now known as ""Bitcoin Pizza Day."" With one bitcoin now worth $9,500, this is apparently a joke and Hanyecz's $45 million pizzas are the punchline.  The joke is also a parable, illustrating the competition and interplay between three potential uses of bitcoin. The first is speculation. Bitcoin's nosebleed-inducing decade of upward price movement is what drives CNBC headlines and motivates participation: People see it as a way to get rich. ""Bitcoin is a way to harness greed,"" said Hanyecz in a recent interview from his home in Jacksonville, Fla. It's greed that underpins the delicate balance of incentives that keeps bitcoin running.  Hanyecz understands that balance well, having been a contemporary of bitcoin’s pseudonymous founder, Satoshi Nakamoto (he says they messaged a few times), and an early bitcoin miner who tinkered to mine more efficiently and earn more bitcoin.  ""Speculation"" is sometimes treated as though it were not a legitimate use. It is, and it has been, an important part of bitcoin's DNA from birth. Even U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has spoken respectfully of bitcoin's role as a ""speculative store of value.""  The volatility that makes bitcoin attractive to investors also makes it difficult to use as money, or ""electronic cash,"" as the Bitcoin white paper specifies. Hanyecz's solid-gold pizzas show us that if CoinDesk paid me in bitcoin, one of us would likely get rekt.  Or would we? Hanyecz works for apparel brand GORUCK as a developer and, partly because he is internet-famous, the e-commerce company is one of a handful that accepts bitcoin. It's a small volume, about two or three orders per week over the past two years, Hanyecz told me. But it's working out.  ""We've just been holding it and we're actually up a significant amount,"" he said. ""We had some people check out at $3,000, we had some people check out at $11,000. The dollar cost averaging people talk about, it works really well.""  That doesn't mean bitcoin for everyday purchases is really a thing most businesses can support, although there are projects, like Lightning Pizza, to make it easier for consumers.  ""It's common knowledge that anybody who held for four years is in the money,"" Hanyecz said. ""But businesses can't generally afford to just hold for four years and not pay their rent.""  Bitcoin as digital gold, or a store of value to accumulate and hold for the long term, has proven more attractive than commerce, as a pair of recent events underscore. First, bitcoin's halving showed in real time bitcoin's inviolable issuance schedule all while central banks test just how much money they can print on demand. Then, on Wednesday, as I was writing down questions for Hanyecz and trying to home-school my kids, someone moved bitcoin that had been sitting in the same place since February 2009.  Hodling is part of what drives the value of bitcoin up, as low velocity can do for any currency. But low velocity can't be the whole story, as Hanyecz realized early on, looking at bitcoin as an experiment.  ""It was a really interesting system but nobody's using it,"" he said. ""If nobody's using it, it doesn't matter if I have it all.""  As widely known and held as bitcoin may be, it's still an experiment. With hedge fund household names placing long-term bets on its viability as ""digital gold,"" that narrative seems set in stone. In fact, it's malleable, like the metal. Ten years from now, it may seem as absurd as a $45 million pizza.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Galen Moore,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/22/10-years-after-laszlo-hanyecz-bought-pizza-with-10k-bitcoin-he-has-no-regrets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5c7ad06d50f91e6cddb461bb3079c09f18abf587-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431952,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN8Eth,1590156009,"Fed Up With Its Fork of Stellar, Kin Is Looking to Move Onto Solana","The kin cryptocurrency is exploring a move from its own fork of Stellar to the Solana blockchain.      To recap, the mobile app company Kik ran a $98 million initial coin offering (ICO) for kin in 2017, which was made on the Ethereum blockchain. Then the company said that it would use Ethereum for security and Stellar for transactions. Then it forked Stellar and ran its own chain. Now that's proving to be inadequate so the cryptocurrency will port over to Solana in a matter of months, pending adequate support from app developers in the Kin ecosystem.      ""The fork of Stellar enabled Kin to reach millions of consumers, but we knew it would not be a long-term solution,"" a Kin Improvement Proposal shared with CoinDesk reads. ""Stellar has five-second block times, so irrespective of network load, a consumer could be seeing five-second latency on their transactions – not what we would deem a great consumer experience.""      Read more: Goodbye Ethereum: Kik Plans to Move Its ICO Tokens to Stellar      Solana is a high-throughput blockchain that relies on a concept called optimistic concurrency control, which assumes transactions generally don't conflict with each other. The project describes several other key features of its technology on Medium.      ""Kin is one the best ways to show what Solana is capable of,"" Anatoly Yakovenko of the Solana Foundation told CoinDesk. ""We expect to see other projects looking for speed and raw horsepower to migrate to Solana as well.""      The Kin Improvement Proposal says the move would enable an 84% reduction in latency. ""Solana is measured to have approximately 60,000 transactions per second, with 400ms block times,"" it says.      The Solana Foundation would actually pay the Kin Foundation for making this move, however, awarding it with up to 1% of the supply of SOL (roughly $6 million at today's prices), with 0.1% unlocking for each new 1 million active users that join over a 24-month period.    Next steps      The next step will be for Solana to make a presentation to kin developers about the process for switching chains. If enough developers agree to make the move, Solana staff will largely facilitate it and the process should be complete in a matter of months.      ""It is ultimately up to the developers in the Kin ecosystem to decide if they want to migrate to Solana; however, we know that speed and throughput are two key issues within this community, and those happen to be two areas where Solana shines brightest,"" Yakovenko wrote.      Read more: Solana Blockchain Adds Korean Stablecoin Terra for Better Payments      Based on the Kin Improvement Proposal, the Solana Foundation will start tracking progress on Jan. 7, 2021.      ""Few projects in the blockchain space have shown an ability to grow a user base as fast as Kin has,"" Gokal wrote. ""We expect to see a myriad of use cases that come out of the Kin ecosystem within the near future that perfectly exemplify Solana's leading performance.""    Why now?      ""What has happened over the last year, but mostly has been accelerated in the last six months, is the kin ecosystem has been growing like crazy,"" Tanner Philp, head of corporate development at Kik, told CoinDesk.      Kin has seen a dramatic uptick in its core metric – monthly active spenders – over the course of the coronavirus quarantine period, Philp said.      In early March, there were approximately 1.5 million people who had spent kin in the prior 30 days. On April 20, the growth spike peaked at 4.4 million. The numbers have trended down somewhat since then but it's still running at about 3.5 million, a significant gain over prior numbers.      Read more: Kin Foundation Publishes First Transparency Report Amid SEC Court Fight      Kin has been integrated into 57 different applications, but usage is dominated by a few popular ones, including apps for sharing media and making funny, shareable shorts.      Kik, the company that still oversees kin, began investigating new blockchains to pursue eight months ago in anticipation of the need to get to something faster, Philp said.      The key use for kin is payments, and that was what Solana was always designed to accelerate.      ""Solana is one of the solutions, if not the only solution, that scales transaction times down into sub-second territory – the type of experience you’d demand for any mainstream application, such as Kin,"" Yakovenko wrote.      Kik believes its Stellar fork has room for several more months, though pending developments could shorten that runway.      ""What we're getting close to is rolling out the new wallet for kin that Kik Inc. is working on, to connect the ecosystem, and that's where you'll start to see some more vibrancy within the ecosystem,"" Philp said.    New features      The wallet will make it simple to move kin earned in one app over to others. The company isn't committing to a timeline but that wallet could appear in late Q3, Philp said.      When that happens, if users start moving tokens around between apps, it will become important to add metadata to transactions showing which application drove the spend. That data helps apps get properly credited by the Kin Rewards Engine. Stellar does not support a large enough amount of data to make its metadata features useful.      Read more: Blockchain Gaming, Messaging Apps See User Growth Amid Coronavirus Lockdowns      Kin was founded out of the company that formerly ran the Kik mobile app. The vision for the cryptocurrency was to create a way for people using mobile and web-based products to have a marketplace of value, but one where that value could be very tiny, for trade in items like digital stickers and access to small games.      Companies are rewarded for building out the kin ecosystem with daily emissions from the Kin Rewards Engine, which shares out its vast trove of undistributed kin to developers who are driving transactions.      ""Kin started out with getting a lot of users using it across a lot of different apps,"" Philp said. ""Now it’s about getting people to spend larger amounts. It started as fractions of pennies, now people are spending pennies, and we expect that to continue to grow.""",POSITIVE,SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | SOL | TOKEN SALE,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/05/22/fed-up-with-its-fork-of-stellar-kin-is-looking-to-move-onto-solana,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e969fc79e5a15e3587e2cda13b75c99484dcc2ad-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

There are 1.24 renBTC live on the Ethereum mainnet now, according to Etherscan. Three sources with knowledge of the project have confirmed this is the Ren smart contract, live ahead of its launch announcement.      Kain Warwick of Synthetix tweeted Wednesday he was the first person to hold a full bitcoin in renBTC.      However, there's no way yet for members of the public to mint additional renBTC, the CEO of the company behind the project told CoinDesk in an email.      ""While the smart contracts have been deployed on Ethereum, RenVM itself is not actually on mainnet. This is because RenVM is a distinct network separate to Ethereum. The final mainnet subzero version of RenVM won't be deployed until later,"" Taiyang Zhang wrote. ""The minted renBTC so far has been from our own internal testing [and] Kain from Synthetix testing the system. The public hasn't been able to mint renBTC thus far.""      RenBTC becomes the latest in a rash of products built to expose bitcoin-backed assets to the benefits of Ethereum's various decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms.      Here's a succinct description of the system from a Medium post by the company's CTO, Loong Wang:    ""Any asset minted on Ethereum by RenVM is a 1:1 backed ERC-20. This means that if you have 1 renBTC (an ERC-20), you can always redeem it for 1 BTC. It's a direct supply peg. renBTC isn't a synthetic, it doesn't rely on a liquidation mechanism, and it's not the price of Bitcoin on Ethereum. It is a one to one representation of Bitcoin on Ethereum that can be redeemed for BTC at any time, in any amount.""  The contracts for the three new tokens are already published in Ren's documentationhttps://docs.renproject.io/developers/docs/deployed-contracts. There are also already 1.12 renZEC minted and a negligible amount of renBCH.    Ren is a project that grew out of the $30 million initial coin offering (ICO) for the Republic Protocol, originally envisioned as a way to run dark pools – privacy-preserving trading venues where the order book is kept secret. According to Crunchbase, its backers included Polychain Capital and FBG Capital.

So we would had to leverage things like atomic swaps, and they're just too painful,"" Wang told The Defiant's Cami Russo. ""And so we kind of turned around to say, well, we need to solve this interoperability problem before large liquidity is actually truly accessible in this space.""      The RenVM is a way to hold a cryptocurrency in a multi-signature wallet controlled by nodes in the RenVM and mint a representation of that asset as an ERC-20 token for use on Ethereum.

42431944,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN8Ehh,1590149874,Canaan Reports $5.6M Loss in Q1 Despite Bitcoin Miner Price Cut,"China-based bitcoin miner manufacturer Canaan has reported a net loss of $5.6 million for Q1 2020, even though it had cut down the prices for its hardware by more than half in an effort to sell more machines.      In an earnings report released on Friday, the firm said it made $9.4 million in revenue for the first three months this year with a growth of 44.6% compared to the same period last year. But it also incurred $9.3 million and $5.9 million expenses in cost of goods sold and R&D, respectively.      For that revenue, Canaan sold 0.9 million terahashes per second (TH/s) of bitcoin computing power, which accounts for less than 1% of the network's current total.      That means Canaan had cut the prices for its mining hardware sold in the first three months by more than 50% to just $10 per TH/s, reflecting an overall slowdown of the buying interest into mining hardware amid bitcoin's halving event and the COVID-19 pandemic that has disrupted global logistics.      For context, Canaan booked a revenue of $66.5 million in 2019 with 2.9 million TH/s of bitcoin computing power sold, meaning the average prices was around $22 per TH/s last year. Other major manufacturers have also taken a similar price cut strategy over the past a few months.      “The overall market situation since December last year until January had not been too good. So the unit price per TH/s was indeed lower,” Zhang Nangeng, CEO and chairman of Canaan, said in an earning call on Friday. “And the logistics in mainland China had basically stopped around the Chinese new year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. So even though bitcoin’s price was a higher point in February and early March, the pandemic largely affected our sales.”      See also: Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Drops by 6% in First Adjustment After Halving      The filing also shows that as of March 31, Canaan had cash and cash equivalents of $37 million, compared to $71 million as of the end of last year.      ""The decrease was mainly due to higher short-term investments as the Company invested RMB173.4 million (US$24.5 million) in short-term investments as of March 31, 2020,"" Canaan said in the report.      Zhang said the firm has partnered China-based Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation – in addition to its existing supply chain partnership with Samsung and TSMC - to roll out bitcoin mining equipment with 14-nm chips and expects to be able to ship in larger quantity in Q2.      But the firm declines to issue a business outlook for Q2 2020 citing the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic and the uncertainties after Bitcoin's halving gives itself ""very limited visibility on the potential impacts to its business and the markets in which it operates.""",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Wolfie Zhao,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/22/canaan-reports-56m-loss-in-q1-despite-bitcoin-miner-price-cut,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/64f5b57deb7bc0b202f4dd6f082209ea99e39842-1474x805.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
