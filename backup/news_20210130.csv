42405812,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeojdc,1612042346,Judge Rejects Virgil Griffith’s Motion to Dismiss Charges of Aiding North Korea,"Virgil Griffith’s motion to dismiss the charges against him claiming he violated U.S. sanctions law in North Korea was denied Wednesday by a judge in the Southern District of New York (SDNY).      U.S. Judge Kevin Castel denied the motion, leaving it up to a jury to decide whether Griffith is guilty of helping North Koreans circumvent U.S. economic sanctions using cryptocurrency. SDNY prosecutors allege Griffith violated the International Emergency Economic Powers Act by giving a speech in April at the Pyongyang Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Conference on how to use cryptocurrency to get around U.S. sanctions.      Griffith’s team has argued his First Amendment rights under the U.S. Constitution protected him and that he did not render North Korea any “services” because he received no compensation for the speech.      “The failure to allege that Griffith was paid a fee by the DPRK does not render the indictment defective,” Castel wrote. “The indictment alleges an object of the conspiracy was ‘to provide services to the DPRK.’ This is sufficient and encompasses the provision of useful labor or human effort whether or not compensation was contemplated.”      The U.S. State Department banned all U.S. citizens from traveling to North Korea without express permission in 2017. According to the judge’s ruling, Griffith’s request was initially rejected by the State Department but was later granted by the DRPK UN mission in Manhattan after he sent copies of his CV, passport and explained his desire to attend the conference.      In his ruling, the judge also denied Griffith’s demand for a bill of particulars. In December 2020, Griffith’s attorneys filed documents arguing he didn’t know what exactly he had been accused of saying or doing.      ""Griffith contends that he is in the dark as to the services he is accused of providing to the DPRK,” Castel wrote. “But Griffith’s briefing to this Court makes it plain that through discovery he has learned much of the government’s evidence. He does not seek the bill of particulars simply as a means to learn facts, but to limit proof at trial. As already stated, a bill of particulars is not a discovery tool to limit the government’s evidence.”",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | REGULATION,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/01/30/judge-rejects-virgil-griffiths-motion-to-dismiss-charges-of-aiding-north-korea,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5850d71e4de7216c302b3d0eea2bead476e79288-2560x1439.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405816,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeojgZ,1612030200,"India’s Proposed Crypto Ban Has Investors Nervous, May Feed Anti-Bitcoin Narrative","India's cryptocurrency investors were caught off-guard and left confused after news broke Friday that the country's Parliament will be considering a government-backed bill that would ban ""private"" cryptocurrencies. Given the ruling party controls both houses of Parliament, the bill's chances of becoming law are good.      The Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill 2021 would prohibit cryptocurrencies in India and provide a framework for creating an official digital currency to be issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The RBI had previously prohibited crypto trading for almost two years before that ban was overturned by the Supreme Court in March 2020.      Industry watchers said the government’s definition of ""private"" could imply that any digital currency that is not sovereign could be seen as a ""private"" currency, including bitcoin. It's unclear which cryptocurrencies would be affected because the bill allows for certain unspecified exceptions to promote the underlying technology of cryptocurrency and its uses.      “This is (the) time to be nervous,” an official at a large cryptocurrency exchange said to the Economic Times of India on the condition of anonymity.      The move is bound to make potential and current crypto investors outside the country nervous as well. When naming potential obstacles to the growth of bitcoin as a store of value, one of the first noted is that governments will try to ban it should it become too successful.  This past week, while appearing more warmly disposed toward bitcoin than he had in the past, Ray Dalio, the founder and co-chairman of Bridgewater Associates, the world's largest hedge fund, listed government prohibition of bitcoin as one of his remaining concerns regarding the cryptocurrency. That one of the world's biggest economies seems poised to do just that seems to confirm that concern.  News of the likely ban may have been a contributing factor in the fallback in the price of bitcoin Friday after it had risen in response to Elon Musk's Twitter-bio shout-out.      Nischal Shetty, CEO of Mumbai-based cryptocurrency exchange WazirX, criticized the announcement via Twitter, explaining that ""there is no such thing as a private cryptocurrency"" and the bill is aimed at helping the RBI create its own central bank digital currency (CBDC) by banning so-called private cryptocurrencies, with some exceptions.      ""A country as large as India should at least work on understanding the underlying terminologies before presenting technology-related bills in Parliament – seems like a hurried move,” said Shetty.      Noting there is still a chance the bill may not become law, he warned that ""wrong or hasty regulations will set us [India] back by a decade. Right regulations will catapult India to the forefront of this technology.""      If the bill becomes law, India would become the only major Asian economy to ban private cryptocurrencies rather than regulating them like corporate stocks.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Tanzeel Akhtar,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/01/30/indias-proposed-crypto-ban-has-investors-nervous-may-feed-anti-bitcoin-narrative,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f8fab54dc22fb96c1e47e34075b32b665381d2cc-1900x1268.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Speaking on the company’s fiscal first-quarter 2021 earnings call, Kelly described cryptocurrencies like bitcoin as “digital gold” that are “not used as a form of payment in a significant way at this point.”      “Our strategy here is to work with wallets and exchanges to enable users to purchase these currencies using their Visa credentials or to cash out onto our Visa credential to make a fiat purchase at any of the 70 million merchants where Visa is accepted globally,” Kelly said.      The payments executive also said stablecoins could be used for “global commerce” and that “digital currencies running on public blockchains as additional networks just like RTP or ACH networks.”      Kelly added:    “Today, 35 of the leading digital currency platforms and wallets have already chosen to issue Visa, including coin-based Crypto.com, BlockFi, Fold and BitPanda. These wallet relationships represent the potential for more than 50 million Visa credentials. The next leading network has a fraction of that. And it goes without saying, to the extent a specific digital currency becomes a recognized means of exchange, there's no reason why we cannot add it to our network, which already supports over 160 currencies today.”  Read more: Visa Abandons $5.3B Acquisition of Plaid Over DOJ Antitrust Concerns",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/01/30/visa-may-add-cryptocurrencies-to-its-payments-network-says-ceo,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5475081d5783a136ac76c08c7d8e29cbd8853b8b-1200x797.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
