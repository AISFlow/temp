Collections have also found a reasonable level of success, given that non-fungible tokens remain relatively young for the blockchain. Nevertheless, developers continue to push for broader adoption when it comes to Cardano NFTs, and a new partnership is allowing the onboarding of a broader range of investors. Pay For NFTs With Fiat One of the things that continue to hold back NFTs is the fact that they are only purchasable using cryptocurrency. This means that, unlike cryptos which investors can just buy directly with fiat, there is now an extra layer and an added step that users have to go through to own these NFTs. However, this is starting to change with the introduction of fiat currency payments for NFTs directly in a marketplace. IOG, the developer behind the Cardano network, has announced a new partnership that will be able to allow investors to purchase Cardano NFTs using fiat currency. NMKR is a Web3 protocol that is helping to accelerate the adoption of this new sector. In this new partnership, the NFT minting and payment infrastructure will provide two things to further the adoption of NFTs on Cardano.

Source: Bloomberg Although there has been some relief in recent weeks for the shares of cryptocurrency mining companies, they remain significantly negative.

42422525,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0mA1h,1660687875,"Bankrupt Crypto Lender Celsius Gets Cash-Injection Offers, Approval to Sell Mined Bitcoin","Bankrupt cryptocurrency lender Celsius Network, which disclosed Monday that it was running low on money, said it has gotten several proposals to inject cash into the company and won approval from a U.S. judge to sell bitcoin (BTC) that it mines.  Celsius lawyer Josh Sussberg disclosed the receipt of cash-injection offers during a Tuesday bankruptcy hearing but didn't say how big the offers were. Moving hastily on this is “mission critical” for Celsius, Sussberg said. It’s customary for companies reorganizing in U.S. bankruptcy court to seek financing to keep their operations going.  Celsius, which fell into bankruptcy this year after the crypto rout prompted it to prevent customers from withdrawing their money, needs liquidity. Financial projections in a court filing Monday showed the company will run out of cash by October and holds $2.8 billion less in crypto than it owes to depositors.  Before filing for bankruptcy, Celsius sold bitcoin that it mined to help fund its operations. Judge Martin Glenn’s approval Tuesday opens the door for that to continue. A document filed prior to the hearing showed that Celsius mined $8.7 million worth of bitcoin in July; the company’s operational and capital costs exceed that.

42422534,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0mALh,1660687519,Bitcoin Miner Riot Takes $349M Goodwill Impairment Charge on Acquisitions,"Riot Blockchain (RIOT), one of the largest publicly traded bitcoin (BTC) miners, recorded $349.1 million in impairment charges to goodwill in the second quarter, tied to its acquisitions of miner Whinstone U.S. and electrical equipment provider ESS Metron in 2021. In its second-quarter earnings released on Monday after the close, it also reported an impairment charge of $99.8 million on its bitcoin holdings.  Large impairment changes have been a common occurrence for miners as the prices of cryptocurrencies have plummeted this year. Most recently, peer Marathon Digital (MARA) said it booked $127.6 million impairment changes in the second quarter due to the decline in the prices of digital currencies.  “Although challenging global market conditions in the second quarter, further impacted by a steep decline in the price of bitcoin and resulting decline in market valuations for publicly traded bitcoin miners, including Riot, necessitated non-cash impairment charges this quarter, these non-cash charges had no impact on our solid financial position and ample liquidity, both of which were further strengthened this quarter,” said CEO Jason Les in a statement.  The miner was scheduled to report its earnings last week, when most of its peers released their results. However, Riot said on Aug. 9 that it delayed its quarterly earnings report because it needed more time to calculate how much the cryptocurrency rout, the war in Ukraine and other macroeconomic issues have reduced the value of its assets.  Riot maintained its hash rate growth guidance of about 12.5 exahash per second (EH/s) by the first quarter of next year, which it first forecasted on Aug. 3.  Riot also reported total first-quarter revenue of $72.9 million, missing consensus estimate of $75.5 million, according to FactSet data. It currently has 44,720 bitcoin miners, with a hash rate capacity of 4.4 EH/s.  Riot shares fell about 6% on Tuesday. Its stock has fallen about 60% this year, in-line with its mining peers, while bitcoin’s price has been cut nearly in half.

42422547,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0mAdh,1660681853,"Market Wrap: Bitcoin's Price Retraces Again, Breaks Below Trendline","Price Action  BTC continues a reversion to the mean, drops below $24,000.  Bitcoin (BTC) declined 1% on Tuesday, marking the second consecutive day of declines for the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Bitcoin’s slide, which was discussed in Tuesday’s First Mover: Americas, began in overnight trading.  Ether’s (ETH) price fell 1.1%, reversing gains made overnight. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization fell below $1,900 after hovering over that threshold for much of the past week.  This article originally appeared in Market Wrap, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  ETH’s total market capitalization is now 50% of BTC’s, approaching levels last seen in January. Viewing ETH’s market cap by comparison to BTC’s indicates the potential for a “flippening” event, where ETH’s total market cap exceeds BTC’s.  According to a report from research firm FSInsight, ether could approach bitcoin’s market cap over the next 12 months. ETH reached 83.2% of BTC’s market cap in June 2017, its highest level to date.  The report attributes the potential occurrence to the Ethereum network’s switch from a proof-of-work platform to a faster, more energy-efficient proof-of-stake one.  Traditional markets were mixed, as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite index sank 0.2% and 0.5%, respectively, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6%  Commodities were also mixed with crude oil down by 3.7%, while natural gas increased 7.7%. Gold, a traditional safe-haven asset, declined 0.37%  Major altcoin prices were largely down with SOL and AVAX declining 2.4% and 1.02%, respectively.  Latest Prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $23,960 −0.3%      ●Ether (ETH): $1,883 −0.9%      ●S&P 500 daily close: 4,305.20 +0.2%      ●Gold: $1,791 per troy ounce +0.5%      ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 2.82% +0.03       Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time.

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Technical Take  BTC prices fall to 20-period moving average after breaching upper Bollinger Band  BTC’s price continued a reversion to the mean, a topic that was discussed in Monday’s Market Wrap. That analysis highlighted BTC’s proximity to the upper range of its “Bollinger Band,” which periodically has resulted in BTC’s price declining to or below its 20-day moving average.  BTC’s current 20-day moving average price is about $23,600, which would imply at least an additional 1% of downside if prices were to behave as they have in the past.  Traders who make use of Bollinger Bands have also used the 20-period MA or below as an area to add to long positions, viewing that as a solid entry point. Traders who expect prices to extend beyond the upper range are prone to add to positions at the moving average itself. Those who believe the moving average represents a solid valuation are prone to add to positions if prices fell below it, because they believe that prices will eventually increase to the average.  BTC’s price reversion remains in an area of solid option buying activity.  Despite the decreasing price, there appears to be bullish sentiment around current price levels. Call open interest exceeds put open interest, resulting in a call/put ratio of 1.88. This is slightly higher than the call/put ratio of 1.85 observed on Aug. 10.  A call represents the right but not the obligation to purchase an asset at a specific price, while a put represents the right but not the obligation to sell an asset at a specified price. Open interest represents the number of active options contracts.  The ratio of calls to puts is an asset’s call/put ratio, and a ratio in excess of one indicates a greater number of calls than puts. The extent to which calls exceed implies bullish sentiment.  Options open interest by strike price shows a concentration of open interest at the $23,000, $24,000 and $25,000 strike prices. In the case of the $24,000 and $25,000 strike prices, the open interest for calls exceeds the open interest of puts.  BTC has broken below its trendline.  BTC has broken below the trendline that the Aug. 3 Market Wrap highlighted. Using the same chart as above, but removing the Bollinger Bands for visual clarity, shows that prices have broken below trend. BTC prices will need to increase about 3% on Tuesday or 6% on Wednesday to recapture their uptrend.  Overlaying (left axis) the volume profile visible range, or VPVR, on the same chart illustrates high levels of volume at the $23,800 price point, which coincides with the 20-period MA. The VPVR displays trading activity over a certain period of time across specified price levels.  Traders may be interested in the extent to which volume declines in the price points between $23,700 and $30,000.  Historically, these “low volume nodes” represent areas where prices are prone to move quickly. This factor, in conjunction with BTC’s proximity to its 20-period MA and the level of call options at the $24,000 and $24,000 strikes, could provide a boost to prices in the near future.

42411397,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNXzQ,1660680945,‘Down Infinite’: A Ham-Fisted Attempt to Rehabilitate Do Kwon’s Image,"Do Kwon, the disgraced co-founder of the Terra blockchain, has given his first public interview since his much-hyped stablecoin, UST, blew up, taking some $45 billion in investments and savings down with it. There have been numerous heartbreaking accounts of small-time investors facing financial difficulties and salacious stories about major crypto institutions that bet big on Terra, and lost, in its wake.  Of course, this isn’t the first time Kwon has spoken publicly. He frequently posts on Twitter about his new blockchain, his legacy, his family. But it is the first instance of a longform interview that could offer the full side of his story.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The interview follows in a long line of media events where besmirched and beclowned figures atone for bad decisions, offer explanations and, on rare occasions, share the type of wisdom only gleaned from being “down bad.” I say it could because Coinage, the new media startup producing the two-part series, so far largely fails to deliver on this promise.  Kwon’s story is bigger than Terra, a (once) multi-billion dollar network that attracted big and small investors to participate in the dream of decentralizing an economy built around a synthetic dollar. Its implosion rocked the crypto industry, contributing to a contagion event that brought down several prominent firms and is still being felt.  It’ll go down in history books as an example of mass delusion, in economics textbooks for its irrational exuberance and likely the crypto legal tradition as a fraud. It also represents some of the confusion about crypto’s future: How can a project with such a clear mission, convincing leader and widespread adoption fail so spectacularly?  The series seems designed to resuscitate Kwon’s sullied image. In a 30-minute interview, filmed over two days, Yahoo Finance alum Zack Guzman asks Kwon questions including, “Are you an Elizabeth Holmes,” did lawyers counsel him against speaking to the press, and is it “fair” to say UST was valueless from the start.  See also: Do Kwon: 'I Am Heartbroken' Over Pain Caused by UST  This is not to knock Guzman for asking obvious questions. There’s value in taking a compassionate approach to interviewing even discredited people and in drawing them out. There’s also value in listening to Kwon in a non-adversarial setting. But if you’re looking for information about what happened to Terraform’s massive bitcoin (BTC) treasury or why Kwon pulled money out of the Curve pool, a move that preceded the Terra network’s collapse, you’ll have to keep digging.  Whose voice?  The tagline Coinage chose, “Down Infinite,” is a Kwon soundbite. It’s a perfect choice for a show that presents Kwon’s point of view uncritically. Not only is this Kwon’s story in his own words but also literally the voice of the publication. It’s also a joke Kwon has told before – and one that seemingly makes light of the real damage he caused to real people.  Indeed, little in the first episode could be considered new. There are a few interesting facts – Kwon more or less confirmed he was involved in failed algorithmic stablecoin Basis Cash, he denied shorting Terra, he alleges there may have been a “mole” at Terraform Labs and he said he has “never” been in touch with South Korean investigators – but no revelations.  Kwon does assume responsibility for Terra’s failure. He said it was an outcome he never predicted, and that his overconfidence was “super irrational.” The project consumed his life. He named his daughter Luna, and said he’s working to make that a name of which she can be proud.  There are times when he looks directly into the camera, as if to apologize directly to those he’s harmed. It is impossible to know what is going through Kwon’s head. As he said, watching a project that made him a billionaire, that put him on magazine covers, that was one of the fastest-growing crypto projects ever go up in flames is not the “type of experience” most people have had.  But it’s hard to say Kwon fully expresses guilt in the first episode, even when he assumes responsibility. He’s asked how he feels about a police raid as part of an investigation into Terra on the home of his former colleague Daniel Shin, with whom he founded the Chai payments network in Korea. Kwon has a “default answer.”  Kwon is not unsympathetic or even wavering. But there are moments when he breaks eye contact, when he seems to be casting about for others to share in the burden. He blames an old version of himself, an “alter ego” who was bombastic and said things he shouldn’t have, who possibly mocked Terra’s detractors as a way to willfully and deliberately mislead investors.  Even so, Terra’s failure seems like an expensive way to learn that “You cannot be emotional about markets, you can't blame people for shorting, you can't call people idiots for longing.”  Little buzz  So far, the series has generated little buzz. The first part garnered a hair over 23,000 views on YouTube, about 4,000 people have minted Coinage's free non-fungible token (NFT) and a couple of hundred people have joined their Discord.  Much of the public conversation around the series has focused on the fact that Terraform Labs is an investor in Coinage, which inevitably raises questions of journalistic independence. (Coinage is also part of “Web3-focused production hub” Trustless Media, which raised a $3.25 million seed round from investors including Sam Bankman-Fried and Ava Labs.)  Guzman, a Harvard graduate, wrote a Twitter thread where he outlined his journalistic ethics. Though there is a “conflict of interest,” the series is not meant to be objective but a way to explain the technical world of crypto to the public at large.  Guzman, too, was an investor in UST and LUNA, who lost out. He said in the interview that “a family friend” committed suicide after Terra’s collapse. There’s a long and drawn-out debate in crypto media about whether journalists should hold the assets they cover, considering the potential for bias or potential to significantly move these illiquid markets.  Guzman is coming from the point of view that his direct experience will inform the story. But I would ask, where is the rightful anger in this case?  See also: UST's Do Kwon and the Human Cost of Lunatic Hubris | Opinion  In the end, it’s not certain whether this interview helps viewers understand Kwon or conceal him more. It’s certainly not the only piece to turn him into a spectacle or a character, and perhaps Guzman is right in saying, “This isn’t a court of law.” It’s possible the interview merely holds a mirror to the crypto industry, which to its credit and fault seems to readily accept and welcome back former fraudsters.  There’s hope that Kwon’s coming interview with industry legend Cobie will be more informative. There’s also hope that part deux of the Kwon tales brought to you by Coinage will take a markedly different tone. But if this is the pilot for a promised media empire, you might write off the venture as another in a series of Kwon’s tragic mistakes.

42422527,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0mA9h,1660680743,SEC Files Complaint Against Dragonchain for Unregistered Initial Coin Offering,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has filed a complaint against blockchain startup Dragonchain for failing to register more than $16 million in crypto asset securities offerings over the course of five years, according to a filing in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington on Tuesday.  The complaint alleges CEO John Roets, along with three Dragonchain entities, violated the Securities Act by raising millions of dollars from the sale of dragon (DRGN) tokens in an initial coin offering (ICO) predominantly marketed to crypto investors in 2017. The company then funneled the money into its marketing and development campaigns, according to the SEC.  “Dragonchain undertook its distribution of DRGNs without registering its offers and sales of DRGNs with the SEC as required by the federal securities laws, and no exemption from this requirement applied,” the complaint reads.  A slew of crypto startups launched ICOs to raise money for their tokens amid the bitcoin market boom at the end of 2017, running afoul of the SEC, which considers token sales securities that should be subject to federal securities laws and information disclosure. The SEC has since brought cases against many of them.  Seattle-based Dragonchain is an enterprise blockchain startup that grew out of a platform originally developed by the Walt Disney Co. (DIS) in 2014. Since going open source in 2016 Dragonchain has faced stumbling blocks navigating regulations challenges. In 2018, the firm forced one of its affiliate projects, Norwegian startup lagon, to return ICO investors’ funds after what appeared to be concerns over the SEC's regulatory crackdown.

42421117,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXZURZ,1660679463,"Congress Must Decide How Cryptos Should Be Regulated, Former CFTC Commissioner Says","Congress needs to decide whether cryptocurrencies are to be regulated as commodities or securities, according to Dawn Stump, a former commissioner of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  Stump, who is now an adviser for crypto risk-monitoring firm Solidus Labs, told CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" show on Tuesday that the industry needs “transparent” rules.  “The reality is that there is no clear distinction between commodities and securities in the crypto infrastructure and Congress may have to step in,” Stump said.  Earlier this month, the Senate Agriculture Committee introduced a bipartisan bill that would give “exclusive jurisdiction” to the CFTC in defining what is and isn’t deemed a “digital commodity.”  Stump’s comments come after the collapse of big crypto companies, including Celsius Network, Voyager Digital and Three Arrows Capital earlier this year. The problems of those firms could be an opportunity for government agencies to finally provide some consistent oversight, Stump said.  “This marketplace has reached a point at which these sorts of principles should be applied in a consistent manner,” she said. That, however, will depend on how regulators “define the registrations that these companies need.”  That is a gray area for the CFTC and the Securities and Exchange Commission, according to Stump, who said the goal of divvying up safeguards should be “more transparent and consistent"" to give platforms “more confidence” about which agency they should register with.  “What’s happening is not necessarily a power grab, but almost a desperate call from the industry for clarity and what the regulatory expectations are,” Stump said.  Stump, however, added that the CFTC “still doesn’t have a clear mandate or authority” on regulating digital assets such as bitcoin (BTC). “That’s where Congress will have to make a decision,"" she said.

42413294,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl8I3O,1660675192,Bitcoin Miner Stronghold Digital Significantly Restructures Debt,"Stronghold Digital Mining (SDIG) said Tuesday it had negotiated with its lenders to dramatically restructure its financing agreements to eliminate more than half of its total debt and associated interest and principal payments.  In a notice to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission earlier on Tuesday explaining that the negotiations were the reason it had delayed reporting its second-quarter results three times over the last few days, Stronghold said the debt restructuring and refinancing agreements were necessary ""for the Company to be able to continue as a going concern for at least the next 12 months.""  The restructuring consists of returning roughly 26,200 miners to NYDIG to eliminate $67.4 million in equipment financing agreements, restructuring and expanding its financing agreements with Whitehawk Finance, and amending its May 2022 convertible notes and warrants.  ""Collectively, the NYDIG, WhiteHawk, and Convertible Notes and Warrants restructurings (i) reduce principal amount outstanding by approximately $79 million (approximately 55% of total principal amount outstanding as of June 30, 2022), (ii) reduce cash interest and principal payments through year-end 2023 by approximately $113 million, and (iii) improve Stronghold’s forecasted cash flow by approximately $40 million through year-end 2023 through a reduction in interest and principal payments and monetization of the power capacity formerly dedicated to miners,"" the company wrote in a press release.  Shares in Stronghold Digital were down almost 11% during the day, and were down another 6% after-hours following the release of details of the restructuring. Publicly traded miners have been battered by the bitcoin bear market, with their shares falling more than 60% on average this year. Stronghold has done even worse, its shares dropping more than 70%. And the group has done even worse than bitcoin itself, which has lost less than half of its value.  Stronghold reported revenues of $29.2 million for the second quarter, below the consensus analyst estimate of $30.3 million, according to FactSet. It also reported a net loss of $40.2 million for the quarter, compared to a net loss of $3.2 million in the second quarter of 2021, with the increase driven primarily by a rise in expenses and impairments on its bitcoin holdings, the company said.  UPDATE (Aug. 16, 2022 18:08 UTC): Added additional quote from Stronghold and information about miners' stock declines.

The IRS has previously served such summons on companies like Kraken and Circle and typically does so when it wants to confirm whether the recipient's customers are properly reporting their taxes. Cryptocurrency transactions are taxed like property, with the IRS collecting capital gains tax on every transaction.  The court order, which was approved by a judge in the Central District of California, authorizes the IRS to serve the summons against SFOX, asking for information about any ""U.S. taxpayers who conducted at least the equivalent of $20,000 in transactions in cryptocurrency between 2016 and 2021 with or through SFOX."" SFOX will be required to share any records identifying those users and their transactions through the service.  In a statement, IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig said the tool is used to ""catch tax cheats.""  ""I urge all taxpayers to come into compliance with their filing and reporting responsibilities and avoid compromising themselves in schemes that may ultimately go badly for them,"" he said.  The IRS press release pointed to crypto transactions' ""inherently pseudo-anonymous aspect"" in explaining the need for a John Doe summons. A a John Doe summons means the IRS doesn't know the specific identities of the potential tax evaders. SFOX itself is not accused of violating any laws.  An SFOX spokesman didn't immediately return a call for comment.

42411400,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNY9L,1660666171,The Downside of Sanctioning Tornado Cash,"We all remember the iconic scene at the start of the “Wizard of Oz.” There’s the terrifying sound of the tornado as it rampages across the land. All the while Dorothy Gale struggles to get home as she holds on to her dog for dear life. At a glance, it’s easy to see this tornado as a force of evil rather than just a neutral act of nature, or even as the start of a powerful chain of positive developments.  But suppose the tornado had never raged through Dorothy’s Kansas. The Wicked Witch of the East would be no worse for wear and would continue causing harm to honest folks in concert with her sister in the West.  The recent sanctions to stop Tornado Cash could have similar unintended consequences as removing the twister from the film. On the surface, they appear to be an honest attempt to stomp out evil, and yet upon closer inspection, they stand to do more harm than good.  Gets is a product manager for Espresso Systems, creators of the Configurable Asset Privacy protocol and team behind the Espresso layer 1 blockchain. Gets has spent the last five years building products and communities behind the scenes for privacy-oriented projects across crypto and Web3.  Last week, the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned Tornado Cash, a privacy tool that has been running on the Ethereum blockchain for three years. The Tornado in this case is a smart-contract application that has drawn concern from the U.S. government for its alleged use in the laundering of hacked or stolen funds by the North Korean government. What makes this event so notable is that the OFAC has sanctioned the code running the Tornado Cash application rather than sanctioning individuals or entities using the tool for crime. The project has been deemed a force of evil.  That, however, may be an opportunity for the crypto industry to focus on advocacy for reasonable approaches to privacy and also to double down on privacy innovations that can protect users without putting users at risk of government backlash. Amid the chaos and fallout of the storm following the sanctions, we can start to discern some areas of opportunity for net-positive outcomes for the industry and for users of cryptocurrency products.  Unstoppable code  There are many uncertainties facing the industry: Tornado Cash is still up and running. Even on the day after the sanctions, it processed over $2 million worth of cryptocurrency transactions. The code itself cannot be stopped. While it remains to be seen whether the smart contract will stay in use and continue facilitating privacy for those who choose to violate the sanction, it is, practically speaking, impossible to shut down at a technological level.  One of the most notable problems has been trolls sending funds from Tornado Cash to random wallets. Since the sanctions were imposed, many withdrawals of 0.1 eth from Tornado Cash have been sent to well-known Ethereum accounts. If the receipt of goods from Tornado Cash is now prohibited, then the owners of these accounts are now, at least on paper, in violation of the new sanction. Even if they’re unlikely to get in trouble, they have to live with a Sword of Damocles over their heads. That risk has even briefly caused innocent users to be barred entry from decentralized applications such as dYdX.  The sanctions have created complexity and raised fears and questions for users of the product who were leveraging it for purely licit and even mundane purposes. Under the new sanctions, it isn’t clear yet what happens to a U.S. citizen who had a substantial amount of funds sitting in Tornado Cash. As of now, his funds are blocked and have to be reported to OFAC. There is no clear process for recovering those funds.  It would appear that recovering his funds would, right now, constitute a sanctions violation. At a minimum, there is no clarity. To many, the sanctions appear either to have been a heartless move, forsaking the privacy needs and financial integrity of innocent users, or to have been a thoughtless one.  It thus becomes clear why sanctions historically have largely been applied to entities involved in laundering money as opposed to the tools and technologies themselves. When applied to the tools, there are inevitably consequences for innocent users. Not only that, but sanctioning the tool, which is built on a decentralized platform run by nodes from all around the world, is arguably not even effective from an enforcement perspective, a notion demonstrated by the fact that Tornado Cash is still processing large volumes of funds.  Tornado Cash exists on the Ethereum blockchain as a smart contract. Ethereum in turn exists as a decentralized database hosted by thousands of nodes spread across the globe, hosted in a diverse set of environments and jurisdictions. All these nodes work together to create and maintain the global Ethereum database through a combination of cryptography and incentives. And the Tornado Cash smart contract is part of that global database. All this makes smart contracts, especially those like the original Tornado Cash contract (without a means to upgrade the code) practically unstoppable.  No permission needed  Not only is the Tornado Cash code unstoppable, it is accessible by anyone with an Ethereum account, meaning it is permissionless and cannot be censored. It can be banned, but enforcement of that ban is challenging and cannot be carried out on the technology itself. Anyone at any time could send funds from Tornado Cash to any Ethereum account, enlisting that account in prohibited activity through no fault of the owner. Someone could even send funds from Tornado Cash to Ethereum accounts controlled by the U.S. government, if there were any known ones.  Imposing sanctions against such a smart contract, rather than against entities using it for illicit purposes, is therefore neither reasonable for innocent users nor particularly effective. The sanctions can’t be enforced and could end up harming people who did nothing wrong in the first place. Yet we must face this new reality. At least for now.  Over the past week, we’ve seen a rallying cry among the cryptocurrency community to push for further decentralization and protection of user privacy. As it stands, the divide between the sanctions’ intentions and their consequences appear to be growing.  There is a possible technological solution, however,. Several projects are working to balance privacy and transparency through the use of zero-knowledge proofs, a cryptographic technique that allows one to prove a statement about a set of data without revealing the data.  For example, my company, Espresso Systems’ CAPE (Configurable Asset Privacy on Ethereum), is a smart-contract application that enables asset creators to configure who can see what regarding the custody and transfer of the assets they create. Similarly, on-chain identity products like Verite and Polygon ID’s zk-credentials can let their users prove they aren't sanctioned individuals without having to necessarily reveal their exact identity.  Combining these types of novel protocols that enable flexibility can help protect everyone’s privacy, no matter what strange lands the whirlwind of regulation ends up taking us to.

Founded by Alex Mashinsky, the company has been affected by the downside trend in the sector and was forced to halt all operations, negatively impacting their clients, and filed for bankruptcy. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Trends Upwards Through Strong Whale Accumulations The report claims that Mashinsky took over the company&apos;s trading strategy back in January 2022. At that time, the price of Bitcoin was hovering around $35,000 to $40,000, and the crypto market was coming out of a major downtrend to find support at these levels. The crypto market went on to trade sideways for over a month, and to move inside a tight range with Bitcoin bottoming at the mid area around $30,000. Aware of the company&apos;s financial situation, and looking to make up for its losses, according to the report, Mashinsky was ready to make a significant bet on the price of Bitcoin. In January, the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) was about to announce its shift in monetary policy to slow down inflation. The financial institution hinted at an interest rate hike regime with a decrease on their balance sheet. Mashinsky was betting on the crypto market trending lower on the back of these announcements.

42422543,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0mAZh,1660663800,Tornado Cash Sanctions Are Spiraling Into Compliance Nightmares,"Crypto privacy mixer Tornado Cash drew attention last week after the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned the service. The implications of complying with the sanctions are starting to sink in with the rest of the industry, raising questions about just what compliance looks like.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Tornado.eth  The narrative  Last week, the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) sanctioned Tornado Cash and 40-something Ethereum and USDC wallets associated with the privacy mixer. I wrote about that last week, but there's so much going on with this story that it’s worth spending more time on it.  Why it matters  We’re still grappling with the fallout from the Tornado Cash sanctions. Now that the initial shock has worn off, the crypto world is starting to examine just what the real impact looks like. People are losing – and then regaining – the ability to interact with decentralized-finance (DeFi) project front-ends based on whether they interacted with Tornado at some point in the past. Others are wondering about their locked-up funds they can no longer touch.  Breaking it down  I was browsing Reddit over the weekend when I came across two threads: One on r/buttcoin poking fun at Aave’s official front-end blocking addresses and one on r/ethereum from a user saying he created a “mirror” user interface to bypass this.  Meanwhile, there's a full-blown debate on Twitter about what exactly a company’s obligation is. Should front-ends block any and all addresses that may have ever interacted with a Tornado Cash address? Or should they be more specific, blocking only transactions that can be directly tied to sanctioned addresses? And while we know that the Tornado Cash and its developers’ GitHub accounts were suspended and at least one developer was arrested, are the sanctions having any effect on Tornado Cash itself?  Let’s answer that last question first. I was curious about what the effect the sanctions had on the mixer’s usage, and so I asked the good folks over at Nansen.ai.  Between July 31 and Aug. 6 (i.e. pre-sanction), Tornado’s users sent about 26,000 ETH into the mixer and took about 25,000 ETH out, according to data from Nansen.  Between Aug. 7 and Aug. 13, users sent in about 11,000 ETH (so this figure went down week-over-week) and sent out … 49,852 ETH. Tornado was sanctioned on Aug. 8, meaning the week-over-week figure nearly doubled. And it’s not that Aug. 7 (the night before the sanctions were announced) was particularly busy: According to Nansen, the inflow amounted to 2,738 ETH, and the outflow was about 1,400 ETH, so not a lot (relatively speaking). The outflow on Aug. 8 was 13,800, a full order of magnitude greater than the day before.  It only gets stranger. Between Sunday and 20:00 UTC on Monday, the outflow topped 15,000 ETH. A single (new) wallet alone accounted for around 9,500 ETH, with someone withdrawing about 100 ETH at a time in a series of transactions spanning about six hours on Monday.  And again, this is happening while DeFi front-ends are blocking addresses, although several loosened some of the blocks later on.  This kind of goes to the heart of what’s happening in this whole ecosystem. The argument is that Tornado Cash is a protocol whose developers cannot control and which is able to operate autonomously. While U.S.-based entities, or entities doing business in the U.S., can and should make every effort to avoid engaging with Tornado Cash addresses, it doesn’t seem like anyone can easily force everyone to stop engaging with Tornado Cash right now.  By the same token, those who really cannot access Tornado Cash include people in the U.S. who used Tornado prior to last week for legitimate purposes. Their funds are stuck, possibly forever, unless the Treasury allows them to make withdrawals.  Innocent parties  Miller Whitehouse-Levine, policy director of the DeFi Education Fund, said he intends to ask the Treasury Department to issue some frequently asked questions that address these issues, as well as create a general license that would allow innocent parties who have used Tornado Cash to withdraw their funds.  “People want to be safe rather than sorry, and it's incumbent on Treasury to explain what people need to do to make sure they’re safe,” he said.  “AML/CFT obligations are risk-based,” he added, referring to anti-money laundering and combating the finance of terrorism.  Last week’s “dusting attacks” perhaps highlight the importance of clarity here. I mentioned this last week (and helped write CoinDesk’s article on it), but if you missed it:  “An anonymous user sent a slew of Tornado Cash transactions to high-profile Ethereum addresses on Tuesday in what appears to be a troll implicating them in a potential regulatory mess.”  Whitehouse-Levine pointed out that the owners of these wallets are obligated to report those transactions to the OFAC within 10 days, and we still don’t know how OFAC will respond – my educated guess is Treasury won’t care too much about the recipients, though the senders are another matter entirely.  Coin Center’s Jerry Brito and Peter Van Valkenburgh said in a blog post that Americans could try to challenge the action if a general license isn’t issued. One concern is that Americans’ property was frozen unilaterally and without due process.  The fact that Tornado Cash is a protocol and not an entity like Blender.io or a person raises other complications.  On Twitter, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), a digital rights and privacy organization, said it was “concerned” about the move, pointing to Tornado being an open-source software project.  Coin Center, a crypto think tank, went a step further, saying it may file a legal challenge.  “By conflating the Tornado Cash Entity and the Tornado Cash Application and adding both to the SDN List, the government has essentially accomplished a ban on Americans using a particular internet tool without any clear prospect that the restriction will ever be lifted,” Van Valkenburgh and Brito wrote. The SDN List is the “specially designated nationals and blocked persons” list, a determination made by the Treasury.  Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard  We continue with the status quo.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Richard Durbin (D-Ill.) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) wrote an open letter to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency asking Acting Comptroller Michael Hsu to withdraw guidance issued in 2020 and 2021 that allows banks to offer crypto-related services.

Outside CoinDesk:  (New York Magazine) We all know the story: Three Arrows Capital borrowed billions of dollars’ worth of crypto, and it’s unclear just where those funds are now. New York Magazine’s Jen Wieczner has an excellent and thorough report on the whole situation, including details about Three Arrows Capital founders Su Zhu and Kyle Davies’ yacht.  (Grid News) The Federal Trade Commission is looking into “how businesses track and use consumer data and whether it should create rules to govern them,” reports Ben Powers of Grid News (formerly CoinDesk’s privacy specialist). This feels like a pretty significant step – we’ve all seen reports about how companies collect data about how people behave online, aggregate it, sell it and otherwise use it.  (Business Insider) An early OlympusDAO investor is suing the project’s founders on allegations they tanked his tokens’ value by taking “away his ability to convert investment tokens to OHM tokens.” The investor, Jason Liang, also claims to identify one of the pseudonymous founders of the project Timothy Troxell as “Zeus” (Liang previously claimed the other pseudonymous founder, “Apollo” was an individual named Daniel Bara.)  (The New York Times) Venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz is backing WeWork founder Adam Neumann’s new real estate firm Flow, with Marc Andreessen, who opposes multi-family homes being built in his town, expected to join the company’s board. And interestingly enough, in May Andreessen Horowitz also invested in Neumann’s other project called Flow, which wanted to tokenize carbon credits and was “paused indefinitely” in June. That this was the other Flow didn’t stop the crypto project’s price from briefly spiking.

42421122,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXZUXl,1660663583,"Tornado Cash US Ban Is ‘Bad Precedent,’ but Monero Was ‘Made for This’: Cake Wallet Exec","The future of privacy tools has been threatened as a result of the U.S. sanctioning coin mixer Tornado Cash, according to one executive at a leading Monero-focused crypto wallet software company.  Justin Ehrenhofer, vice president of operations of Nevis-based Cake Wallet, told CoinDesk TV on Monday the sanction is a “step backwards” for open-source tools.  “I feel uneasy with the recent actions,” Ehrenhofer said on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” show. “I don’t like them at all.”  Ehrenhofer’s comments come after the sanctioning of Tornado Cash by the U.S. Treasury Department. Blocking all U.S. persons from using the crypto mixing service has created concerns about privacy when transferring coins between blockchains.  “I think it’s the wrong idea to try and sanction open-source tools,” Ehrenhofer said.  The executive at the hot wallet-based open-source project said users in the Monero community fear the possibility the U.S. government could shut down their project, too.  “It’s definitely a valid concern,” he said.  Monero (XMR) is a digital currency that lets users make and receive transactions anonymously. Its decentralized protocol is used by many to maintain their privacy in transactions. “It’s meant to be censorship resistant,” Ehrenhofer said.  He criticized government attempts to go “after the entire network” rather than sanctioning individual smart contract addresses. In Tornado Cash’s case, all U.S.-based users were banned from interacting with the coin mixer or any of the Ethereum wallet addresses tied to its protocol.  Ehrenhofer said the government will need to respond in “a way that allows individuals to retain their right to transact.”  And while it still remains unclear what Tornado Cash's ban could mean for other privacy tools in future, it does create “a bad precedent,” Ehrenhofer claimed.  “It’s hard to develop mass surveillance on the blockchain,” he said, referring to the potential government sanctions of privacy tools in the future.  Meanwhile, upgrades continue for the Monero system, whose privacy coin is currently valued at nearly $3 billion. Over the weekend, the Monero protocol created a hard fork that includes a number of upgrades intended to preserve user privacy.  Upgrades include an increase in ring signatures from 11 to 16. The revamp is intended to increase the number of signers per transaction. In addition, the protocol has undergone an upgrade to its “Bulletproof” algorithm, which will improve the size of transactions in an effort to make them “more private and more efficient.”  Read more: What the Tornado Cash Sanction Means for Privacy Coins",NEGATIVE,XMR,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | REGULATION | XMR | FORKS,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/08/16/tornado-cash-us-ban-is-bad-precedent-but-monero-was-made-for-this-cake-wallet-exec,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3e60d581567b90ba0252cbb930985106166419e6-1408x1056.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421814,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXwA85,1660660895,"How Blocks Are Added to a Blockchain, Explained Simply","While blockchain is often synonymous with cryptocurrency, the technology has a range of uses across industries. These days you can find blockchains being used to store asset data ranging from real estate purchases to supply chain management in sectors including health care and education.  In all use cases, blockchain functions as a shared, unchangeable digital record of all transactions, called blocks.  Here’s how blocks are added to the blockchain.  What is a blockchain?  A blockchain, also known as Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), is a decentralized record of transactions that is constantly reviewed and updated. Virtually any asset can be tracked by a blockchain network, though the technology is widely associated with cryptocurrencies like bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), which each have their own associated blockchain network.  In the past, transactions were tracked and stored by financial institutions, and auditing that information was often time consuming and limited to certain privileged parties.  Blockchain technology makes record keeping transparent and allows it to be shared across networks. No single party can change a transaction after it has been added to the ledger, and automated tools called smart contracts can execute transactions without requiring an intermediary like a bank. In addition, there is no single master copy of the blockchain; instead, the information is cross-checked (validated) by other computers (nodes) in the network.  In short, blockchain technology can enhance security, create greater trust and speed up transactions within a network.  How does blockchain work?  Broadly speaking, the two main components of blockchains are the blocks of information and the infinite virtual chain that connects and tracks that information.  Here are a few additional key terms to understand:  Block – a collection of data that contains a timestamp and other encrypted information about recent transactions that need to be validated by the network before being added to the chain  Nodes – the computers in a network that maintain full copies of all the transactions, making it virtually impossible to tamper with them  Hash – the alphanumeric string that confirms transactions on the blockchain and serves as a digital footprint  Mining – the process of verifying and adding blocks to a blockchain ledger, as well as adding cryptocurrency coins into circulation using a proof-of-work consensus mechanism  Nonce – short for ""number used only once;"" an encrypted number that miners have to solve to verify a new block in the blockchain before closing it  Distributed ledger – a database that is shared and synchronized among members of a decentralized network  Block reward–the incentive mechanism earned by miners that is used to encourage network participation  There are several longstanding technologies that work together to power a blockchain. Cryptography refers to securing information by transforming it so that only the intended recipient can process it. Blockchain uses two types of cryptographic keys – a public key and a private key – to create a secure digital identity. A distributed network is then used to validate transactions and keep the network secure. The entire process is governed by a unique set of rules called a protocol.  How are blocks added to a blockchain?  There are different consensus mechanisms used to verify transactions and add new blocks to a blockchain. In cryptocurrency, the most common methods are proof-of-work and proof-of-stake.  Bitcoin was introduced in Satoshi Nakamoto's 2008 paper titled ""Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System"" and was the first major application of blockchain technology. It uses a proof-of-work consensus method to create new blocks and enter new bitcoins into circulation. This method verifies transactions through mining, and users who verify transactions are known as miners.  Because there is no central authority, transactions are managed and new coins are issued collectively by the network.  Here's an example of how a bitcoin transaction would take place:  Say User A wants to send 1 bitcoin (BTC) to User B.  When User A initiates a transaction, information about the sender and receiver is packaged and timestamped on a block and sent to a queue called a mempool (short for memory pool) where it will wait to be validated and added to the blockchain.  Miners that have successfully discovered blocks will take batches of transactions and verify that all of the information, including digital signatures, messages and public keys, are legitimate.  Once the information is verified, the block is broadcast to all the nodes in the network, who must check and agree that the block is valid before adding that block to the official chain. The average time it takes to confirm a bitcoin transaction is about 10 minutes.  When the process is complete, User B will have received 1 BTC sent to them by User A, all nodes on the network will have agreed to the transaction using the chosen consensus model and a bitcoin miner will have earned a reward for verifying a successful transaction. New blocks of information about that transaction are now linked to each other as part of an infinite and public chain.  Future blockchain uses  Today, there are thousands of cryptocurrencies that run on dozens of blockchain networks, though blockchain technology has practical uses that extend beyond cryptocurrency transactions. Blockchain networks, like Ethereum and Bitcoin, are continuing to upgrade their networks, integrating new ways to become more efficient, energy conscious and cheaper than ever before.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Xenia  Soares,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/how-blocks-are-added-to-a-blockchain-explained-simply,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2abe6169f89042c943136f0b6ebb09a0f7bb54bb-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42422544,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0mAbh,1660660451,Crypto Twitter Sees 'Bearish Wedge' Pattern in Bitcoin's Price Recovery,"Bitcoin (BTC) has gained 36% in two months, offering relief to the battered bulls. However, according to Crypto Twitter, the recovery has suddenly drawn the shape of a bearish pattern on price charts and could be short-lived.  ""BTC is consolidating within a rising wedge, which is a bearish pattern,"" Milan Vojtek, a technical analysis enthusiast, tweeted early Tuesday, echoing the views of his Twitter compatriots.  A rising wedge represents a bounce contained between two converging trendlines connecting higher lows and higher highs. The converging nature of trendlines indicates volatility is contracting as prices rise, a sign of recovery losing steam – and that tension is building, with sellers contesting the move higher.  So an occurrence of a rising wedge often has traders preparing for a fresh price drop. Chart-based traders typically take short positions – bets on declines – when prices dive out of the rising wedge, confirming a breakdown. The pseudonymous analyst Nebraskagooner tweeted, ""Really not looking hot here after multiple rejections. A rising wedge breakdown would target a $21,500 area.""  The predictive power of technical analysis patterns is tied to their popularity, meaning sometimes these patterns can become a self-fulfilling prophecy; the greater the number of people tracing the rising wedge, as is the case with bitcoin, the stronger the probability of a renewed drop.  Bitcoin has yet to dive out of the rising wedge, but if it does there could be renewed selling, as feared by Crypto Twitter. The pattern has also drawn the attention of savvy traders.  ""Bitcoin has managed to hold up much better than I thought it might, but the outlook appears to be the same,"" Michael Kramer, founder of Mott Capital Management, wrote in a market update published Sunday. ""A rising wedge pattern is forming within the bear flag pattern, strengthening the case for this fall lower and potential test $16,400.""  Macro leans bearish  Macro and fundamental factors can singlehandedly make or break patterns. To the disappointment of bitcoin bulls, macro factors seem to support the case for a wedge breakdown. Analysts at ING expect financial conditions to tighten while heading into the U.S. Federal Reserve's Sept. 20-21 policy meeting.  Financial conditions are determined by the U.S. dollar exchange rate and bond yields. A rising dollar and bond yields mean financial conditions are tightening, a bearish development for liquidity-addicted risk assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies.  ""Expect financial conditions to re-tighten in the weeks and months ahead. After all, that's what the Federal Reserve wants and needs,"" ING analysts wrote in a blog post published Monday. Per ING, U.S. financial conditions were very tight at the end of June, but have considerably loosened since then.  ING analysts added the Fed would be hoping the financial conditions re-tighten, ""Otherwise the Fed will be left with the less comfortable position of coaxing tighter financial conditions, whether through the verbal or policy action route.""  The U.S. dollar is already on the rise. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback's value against major fiat currencies, neared 107.00 early today, extending the recovery from the past week's low of 104.63.  The yield on the 10-year Treasury note held steady above 2.8%, having put in a low of 2.67% following last Wednesday's soft U.S. Consumer Price Index release. The resilience in the yield suggests traders of risk assets may be wrong to conclude that inflation in the U.S. has peaked and the Federal Reserve will probably slow liquidity tightening in the coming months.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/08/16/crypto-twitter-sees-bearish-wedge-pattern-in-bitcoins-price-recovery,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0371c43adbc8de1d32ffd843e173ec0cbe0ef37b-1705x1279.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Through the Inter Protocol Overblock Rate (IPOR) traders will be able to hedge, arbitrage and take directional positions on the interest rate movements to manage risk across their credit portfolios on the Ethereum blockchain.  “Decentralized finance (DeFi) has immature markets that need market transparency for all actors,” Darren Camas, CEO of Zug, Switzerland-based IPOR Labs, told CoinDesk.  The protocol offers the ""IPOR Index,"" a standardized benchmark rate based on smart contract transactions and its own interest rate derivatives decentralized exchange (DEX).  IPOR is an algorithmic model of The London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), but for DeFi. The LIBOR was once a benchmark interest rate that global banks lend to one another in the interbank market for short-terms loans, but it was discontinued in 2021.  Darren said the IPOR is crucial in the current market for institutional participation. “We need to connect the institutional fixed income world to DeFi, and for this to happen they need risk management tools and transparency,”  IPOR consists of two parts. One is the IPOR index, a LIBOR-like benchmark interest rate sourced directly from DeFi smart contracts. Camas explained that unlike the LIBOR, which was discontinued due to manipulation by traders and inside banks, the IPOR Index is based on auditable and real-time smart contract interactions.  The second part is the DEX, which IPOR says is the first derivative instrument. It is based on the IPOR index and is a 28-day cancellable swap that uses a peer-to-pool model between a trader and the liquidity pool as underwriter for both pay-fixed and receive-fixed contracts.  “In the wake of the market collapse due to multiple [U.S. Federal Reserve interest] rate hikes, and the downfall of bad actors such as Three Arrows Capital, Celsius Network and Terra, risk management comes to the forefront of crypto, particularly in the credit markets,” Camas said.  “Where [centralized finance] becomes the villain, DeFi has taken a hero role, particularly in the credit markets where major platforms have functioned flawlessly during the market downturn,” he added.

Ethereum Foundation Executive Director Aya Miyaguchi noted during the opening keynote on Thursday that the city has generated one of the world’s strongest Ethereum communities.  “The hackathons and crypto gatherings in this place were the origin of birth to the teams and individuals that have built this beautiful community,” Miyaguchi said. The Buenos Aires event was the first of nine ETH conferences that will take place across Latin America, with the final event in Panama on Oct. 28.  ETHLatam marked Argentina’s first mainstream, international crypto event since the crypto boom started in the South American country in 2019. Argentina has welcomed millions of new users to the crypto segment since then, becoming one of the world's top 10 countries for crypto adoption.  In attendance was Buenos Aires Mayor Horacio Rodriguez Larreta, a candidate for the country’s presidency next year who has tested integrating crypto into the financial system. In April, he announced the city would allow residents to pay taxes using cryptocurrencies.  In addition, Diego Fernández, the city’s secretary of innovation and digital transformation, announced Thursday that Buenos Aires plans to deploy Ethereum validation nodes in 2023. He added that the effort “has exploratory and regulatory purposes” and will help the city of three million people “develop adaptable regulation” for crypto.  If successful, Buenos Aires would become one of the world’s first cities to deploy Ethereum nodes. And it also plans to be among the first to launch a blockchain-based digital identity platform, TangoID, which would give residents control over their personal data as of January 2023.  On Saturday, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin tried to explain the Ethereum overhaul known as the Merge in a video call in Spanish. He also talked about various topics, including LUNA and the Tornado Cash developer arrested in Amsterdam.  The strong relationship between Buterin and Argentina is nothing new. In December 2021 he visited the country, met with different personalities and spoke to a full house of 1,200 people. Buterin even attended a guided tour through Buenos Aires with Jerónimo Ferrer, a bitcoin evangelist who explains to foreigners how the Argentine economy and its runaway inflation promotes the use of crypto.  One more crisis, but with crypto  Since mid-2019, Argentina has been living through a financial crisis that has led to high inflation and a devaluation process that took the Argentine peso from 40 to the U.S. dollar in August 2019 to 350 in July this year.  Argentina is used to systematic traumatic, economic experiences, such as the so-called corralito in 2001, when the government confiscated savers’ deposits. Crypto growing in popularity is logical, given how younger generations watched their parents suffer because of government mismanagement.  Read more: Why Argentines Are Turning From Dollars to Stablecoins Like DAI  Currently, the Argentine government's foreign exchange restrictions prevent locals from buying more than $200 per month in commercial banks, although Argentinians can access foreign currency in brokerage houses or stablecoins in crypto exchanges.  Crypto has beaten the traditional stock market in Argentina. According to Argentina’s Securities Exchange (Caja de Valores), Argentinians had opened 575,000 accounts with brokerage houses as of the first quarter of 2022. The local crypto exchange Lemon alone has more than 1.3 million users.  Increasing use of debit cards that local exchanges such as Lemon, Buenbit and Belo launched in the last year and a half, can partly explain Argentina’s crypto boom. They have made crypto transactions user friendly and include cashbacks. Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, joined the boom in early August.  Crypto yields double those of developed markets have led many users to avoid interest rates in Argentine pesos and turn to generating returns in stablecoins tied to the U.S. dollar, such as DAI or USDC. Exchange houses, do not offer interest rates, which makes them less desirable given high U.S. inflation.  Argentines have even learned to use crypto to hedge against government announcements on Friday afternoons or weekends, when the financial markets are already closed. On the July Saturday following the resignation of Argentina’s economy minister, Martin Guzmán, due to the economic crisis, Argentines purchased between two and three times as many stablecoins as they do on a typical weekend. They were hedging against a potential devaluation of the Argentine peso on Monday when equity markets reopened. That became reality.  Many young people involved in the Argentinian crypto ecosystem have decoupled their incomes from the local government by earning in U.S. dollars, euros or crypto working abroad from Argentina.  First generation entrepreneurs  ETHLatam featured a first generation of crypto Argentinian entrepreneurs who have become global players in their segments, such as Decentraland, which is building a metaverse on the Ethereum blockchain, and the decentralized finance (DeFi) audit firm OpenZepellin. The bitcoin (BTC) wallet startup Muun also appears among the outstanding cases.  The three firms had their beginnings in Casa Voltaire, a building in Buenos Aires’ Palermo neighborhood. Casa Voltaire was a meeting point for different crypto developers between 2014 and 2016.  Now, a second wave of crypto entrepreneurship is generating promising projects. The Argentinian entrepreneur Patricio Worthalter talked at ETHLatam about POAP, a Proof of Attendance Protocol that gives unique NFTs to people to commemorate and prove they attended an event (virtual or physical).  The Argentina-born Exactly protocol passed a testnet at ETHLatam. It is a decentralized, non-custodial, open source protocol providing an autonomous interest rate market to lenders and borrowers. Gabriel Gruber, Exactly co-founder and CEO, told CoinDesk that the protocol, setting interest rates based on credit supply and demand, will allow the users to frictionlessly exchange the time value of their assets at both variable and fixed interest rates for the first time in DeFi.  Another Argentinian, Web3 entrepreneur, Juani Gallo, shared details of FundIt, a crypto crowdfunding project, created in partnership with the Argentinian entrepreneur Damian Catanzaro.  Cantanzaro’s previous project, Cafecito, a tipping platform, has reached one million users. The platform integrates with the Lightning Network, the layer 2 payment product built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain to accelerate transactions.  According to Manuel Beaudroit, CEO at the local exchange Belo, Latin America is among the few regions using technology to solve specific, daily problems, compared to Asia or the U.S., which use tech to improve trading and speculation systems.  “In Argentina and Latina America, we need to solve issues of inflation, remittances, value protection, and savings in general,” Beaudroit told CoinDesk. “That is what a large part of the ecosystem is working to solve and bring these applications to the ecosystem.”",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET,"Andrés Engler, Marina Lammertyn",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/08/16/argentina-ethereum-conference-highlights-cryptos-growing-reach-in-the-country,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/11637c2850d79fcb9ae82431a161c03f38abff6f-1600x1200.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Huobi Global announced it will stop offering derivatives trading services to users in New Zealand.  Market Moves: Could a BTC bottom indicator have marked a price bottom for the cryptocurrency?  Chart of The Day: A risk reset in equities contributes to ether rally.  This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Price point  After failing to maintain the $25,000 mark on Monday, bitcoin (BTC) dropped to a low of $23,788 overnight. Perhaps that indicates that bitcoin’s two-month rally has ended.  Meme token dogecoin was up 15% over the last 24 hours. Crypto investor Lark Davis said that the token is rallying ahead of the launch of Dogechain, which requires wrapped doge for trading.  Ether (ETH) was up slightly on the day, trading at about $1,900. According to a report from research firm FSInsight, ether has a good chance of exceeding bitcoin in market cap over the next 12 months because the Ethereum blockchain’s switch to the proof-of-stake mechanism will reduce the production of the tokens and selling pressure from miners.  A report from CoinShares showed that crypto funds had $17 million in outflows in the seven days up to Aug. 12, ending six consecutive weeks of inflows. Bitcoin investment products saw $21 million in outflows, and short bitcoin positions, which bet on a price decline of the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, had $2.6 million in inflows.  Cryptocurrency exchange Huobi Global announced it will stop offering derivatives trading services to users in New Zealand starting next week, just a couple of months after it expanded operations to the country. The Seychelles-based cryptocurrency exchange cited ""local compliance policies"" as the reason for withdrawing margin trading services, options and exchange-traded products.  Celsius Network, a crypto lender that filed for bankruptcy in July, appears to be in even worse financial straits than previously signaled. A court filing Monday from Kirkland & Ellis, a law firm the crypto lender hired to lead its restructuring efforts, included financial projections that Celsius will run out of cash by October.  In Latin America, Brazil’s largest brokerage, XP, launched bitcoin and ether trading. The company, which has 3.6 million customers, hopes to reach 200,000 active crypto users by the end of this year.

The Puell Multiple, a bottom signal for bitcoin, sits at 0.54, and values under 0.50 have historically marked price bottoms and are considered to be good accumulation zones.  The indicator fell to 0.34 in July, which was its lowest level since 2019, according to data from Delphi Digital.  The Puell Multiple is the daily issuance of BTC (in USD) divided by the 365-day moving average of the daily issuance of BTC (in USD). It compares the short-term revenue of BTC miners to its longer-term trend. A lower score equates to lower revenue for miners.  Since 2014, the Puell Multiple has gone below 0.50 only four times, including during the previous market bottoms of 2015 and 2019, the COVID 19-induced crash of spring 2020 and the market downturn last month, according to Delphi Digital.  Delphi Digital notes that even as the Puell Multiple seems to indicate a market bottom, other indicators must be used in tandem to conduct a meaningful analysis.  Chart of the Day  Risk Reset in Equities Contributes to Ether's Rally  by Omkar Godbole  The chart tweeted by pseudonymous analyst Cantering Clark shows ether's recent rally has been accompanied by an uptick in the S&P 500, Wall Street's benchmark equity index.  Perhaps, the Merge is not the only factor driving ether higher, and the native token of Ethereum's blockchain may find it hard to continue gaining ground in the weeks ahead if stocks turn lower.  Latest Headlines  Bitcoin Miner PrimeBlock Cancels Listing Plans, Terminates $1.25B Merger With 10X Capital: The two firms terminated their agreement, which would have allowed Prime Blockchain to go public, by mutual consent on Aug. 12.

In a joint statement on Monday, local police and the diamond unit tax authority announced that three alleged fraudsters accused of laundering money from overseas crimes were arrested in Israel. French Official&apos;s Investigation The economic incentives given out by the French government during the COVID-19 epidemic were a crucial component of the criminal plot, according to The Times of Israel. French officials took the initiative in the scheme&apos;s investigation last year, and Israel&apos;s police followed through on an undercover operation. Other suspects who have not been identified have also been detained and are being questioned. The Yahalom unit of the tax authorities and the special crime unit Lahav 433, Israel&apos;s equivalent of the FBI, are handling the investigation. They are working along with Europol and French law enforcement across Europe.

42422556,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0mIFh,1660654800,Jump Crypto Picked to Revamp Solana to Make Blockchain More Reliable,"Jump Crypto is trying to revamp a core part of Solana’s infrastructure, seeking to boost the throughput and reliability of a network that’s been plagued by frequent outages and slowdowns.  The cryptocurrency arm of Chicago-based TradFi giant Jump Trading Group is building a new validator client, which is software that helps secure a blockchain. Additionally, Jump Crypto will “propose significant upgrades to Solana’s open-source core software,” according to a statement released Tuesday.  For Wall Street and other conventional finance firms like Jump, Solana turned into a key focus last year given that – unlike Ethereum and other blockchains used in decentralized finance (DeFi) – it was viewed as being able to keep pace of the incredibly fast pace of trading in older markets like stocks and derivatives. But the hype wasn’t always realized, with Solana breaking down in several high-profile incidents. Meanwhile, newer blockchains threaten Solana’s market share.  “Jump has unparalleled experience with over 20 years of scaling networks and building highly performant software systems,” Dan Albert, executive director of the Solana Foundation, said in the statement. “Their contributions to the Solana Network will improve mission-critical systems, helping the network scale to billions of users.”  Kevin Bowers, chief science officer at Jump Trading, will oversee the project. Through an initiative called Firedancer, Jump Crypto will build the validator client using the C++ programming language, which has a long history in the quantitative trading circles where Jump roams.  Jump Crypto’s statement Tuesday says the initiative is an “important step in the network’s continued decentralization.”  Jump Crypto has firsthand experience with the dangers of a project’s well-being resting too much on a single company’s shoulders. It’s a driving force behind Wormhole, a cross-blockchain bridge that got hacked earlier this year. Jump Crypto coughed up money to cover losses from the $320 million exploit.  Jump Crypto also expanded Wormhole onto the Terra blockchain last October. Months later, Terra’s UST stablecoin depegged in dramatic fashion, a blow that sent Terra’s LUNA token plummeting and users fleeing the network.  In the past year, the company has expanded beyond its pure trading roots, venturing into building key pieces of infrastructure for Solana and other popular layer 1 blockchains. The company, which emerged from the Chicago trading pits, has been at the forefront of electronic trading for more than two decades. It’s among the firms that built up the infrastructure of markets like stocks and derivatives so that they operate – literally – at the speed of light.  Read More: Jump Crypto Wants You to Know Its Name  Jump Crypto’s involvement in this Solana overhaul comes at an uncertain time for the once-hot blockchain. It suffered a major outage in June that rendered it unusable for over four hours, as well as a $5 million hack affecting thousands of user wallets earlier in August.  Solana’s SOL token is down 75% this year, trading relatively flat in recent months even as ether, the token for competing blockchain Ethereum, has more than doubled from its lows.  But it appears Jump is doubling down on Solana, even though it’s also a major backer of hot new “Solana-killer” blockchain Aptos.  “I’m excited for Jump’s engineers to bring a new perspective to the network and help improve network resiliency and efficiency,” Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko said in the statement.",POSITIVE,SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | SOL | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Tracy Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/08/16/jump-crypto-picked-to-revamp-solana-to-make-blockchain-more-reliable,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f2f425a76d4b0b02345b27d31ee931ff7a68b102-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Key Technical Points: The Chainlink (LINK) price has increased 8% in the last three days. The bull run fails to exceed the $9.5 mark leading to the possibility of a cup and handle pattern formation. With a market cap of $4.08 billion, the intraday trading volume of Chainlink has decreased by 21% to reach $375 million. Past Performance of LINK As we mentioned in our previous analysis, the Chainlink (LINK) price broke the 100-day SMA after retesting the consolidation breakout to reach $9.50. However, the increased selling pressure at $9.50 nullified the rounding bottom breakout possibility leading to an 8% drop over the last 72 hours. Additionally, the resulting downtrend creates a three-black crows pattern but the recent Doji candle hints at a morning star pattern formation.

This minor pullback may discount the coin price and attract more buyers to the market. The 20-and-100-day SMA nearing a bullish crossover at $8.4 could stall the current correction.

42422567,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0mIdh,1660643610,Crypto Derivatives Traders Bet on Ether Staking Yields Doubling to 8% Post-Merge,"The major Ethereum overhaul known as the Merge looks poised to make staking the blockchain's ether (ETH) tokens more rewarding than ever.  That's the message from derivatives traders, anyhow. Yields are seen jumping to 8% from around 4% now, according to interest-rate swap pricing on the Voltz Protocol. The Merge is likely to happen soon, with Ethereum's backers eyeing September for the event. Ether prices have surged in recent weeks in anticipation, and higher yields would further enrich the ether ecosystem.  Investors can bet on future yields for Lido's staked ether (stETH) token and Rocket's rETH through Voltz. At press time, most traders on those two pools were what's known as variable takers (VTs), meaning they're swapping a fixed interest rate for a variable rate, believing staking yields will double to 8%. About 82% of the just over $12 million in those pools, which went live July 1 and will expire at the end of December, are VT investments.  ""With so many traders choosing to be VTs, this suggests the vast majority are expecting variable rates [staking yields] to increase substantially from where they are today,"" Simon Jones, Voltz CEO and co-founder, told CoinDesk.  The emergence of the decentralized finance (DeFi) interest rate swap market may help accelerate market maturity by allowing borrowers and lenders to hedge risks and facilitate price discovery of interest rates. It's yet one more way cryptocurrencies are looking more like traditional financial markets.  The two-month-old Voltz protocol allows traders to create a market for any variable rate of return. Traders in stETH and rETH pools can swap fixed for variable return and variable for fixed return with leverage merely by depositing ether as margin. Traders do not need to hold stETH or rETH to enter the trade.  Voltz's swap market is analogous to the traditional interest rate market, where two counterparties agree to exchange one stream of future interest payments for another. A common TradFi strategy is exchanging a fixed interest rate for a floating rate, often traded against an industry benchmark interest rate, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR).  Variable takers can earn a 150% annual percentage yield by taking a levered bet through stETH pools, Jones told CoinDesk earlier this month.  ""If the stETH rate is higher through the pool's term than the fixed rate at the point of entering the pool, the trader will be in the money and will have successfully traded The Merge in one of the most capital efficient ways possible,"" the official explainer said.  The Merge will combine Ethereum's current proof-of-work chain with the proof-of-stake beacon chain that has been running since December 2020.  After the upgrade, ether's total new issuance will likely drop by 90%, bringing a store of value appeal to the cryptocurrency. Beacon Chain stakers currently earn block rewards. Post-Merge, stakers will get a share of transaction fees and revenue from what's known as miner extractable value (MEV), or ordering blockchain transactions in the way that generates the most money.  The upgrade has most market participants taking bullish exposure on ether in the spot and derivatives markets and buying stETH tokens. However, rates play may be a relatively safer option in the current macroeconomic environment.  Ether's price and the prices of its staked derivative tokens are vulnerable to the U.S. Federal Reserve's ongoing campaign of increasing interest rates. In other words, the Merge-driven upside in ether and related tokens could remain elusive due to Fed tightening. Staking yields, however, could continue to stay resilient and rise as expected after the Merge. The yield on staked ether has remained steady at around 4% throughout the recent bear market.  That said, leverage also brings with it the chance of forced liquidations due to margin shortages. Another source of risk is a potential drop in yields. ""While leverage increases your potential upside, it also exposes you more on the downside, meaning you could get back less than you put in,"" Jones said.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/08/16/crypto-traders-bet-on-ether-staking-yields-jumping-to-8-post-merge,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5584f8bdf3d9d930d0d39f9bb61f13b23a68a538-1707x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42422554,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0mIJh,1660642948,FSInsight: Ether May Well Surpass Bitcoin’s Market Cap in Next 12 Months,"Ether (ETH) has a good chance of exceeding bitcoin (BTC) in market cap over the next 12 months because the Ethereum blockchain’s switch to a proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism will reduce both the production of the tokens and selling pressure from miners, research firm FSInsight said in a recent report.  Once the transition, known as the Merge, is completed, the “inflation rate of supply will decline” and selling pressure from miners will be “locked at zero,” the research firm said. Bitcoin has a market cap of about $461 billion, CoinDesk data shows, compared with Ethereum's $226 billion.  There are widespread misconceptions that PoS validation will allow Ethereum to scale better. However, this is false because the blockchain will still be relatively expensive at the base layer, the report said. The main purpose is to reduce energy consumption by 99.9% and to allow more users to contribute to block production, Sean Farell, head of digital asset strategy at FSInsight, wrote in the report. The switch from proof-of-work (PoW) is the first of five planned upgrades for the blockchain, and is provisionally expected to happen in September.  FSInsight said that while it is likely there will be some secondary market selling pressure from investors looking to reduce their risk exposure after the completion of the Merge, as the network settles “flow imbalances from a deflationary supply have the potential to be incredibly constructive for price.”  “Merge-adjacent” names, which include Lido's LDO token, Rocket Pool's RPL, Optimism's OP and Polygon's MATIC are attractive opportunities for “high-beta” exposure to the process, the note added.

The firms joined the protocol to improve cross-chain interoperability, security and capital efficiency for their users  Optimism users will now be able to borrow against their crypto assets, while benefiting from competitive gas fees, attractive rewards, and yield options. Decentralized finance (DeFi) refers to financial activities carried out on a blockchain without the use of third parties, while layer 2 is the system built on top of blockchains in order to process more data.  “By launching on Optimism, we aim to make DeFi more accessible, scalable and reliable as the protocol-to-protocol liquidity backbone,” explained Puff, lead contributor to the Iron Bank, in a statement to CoinDesk.  In recent months, Optimism has become one of the most used layer 2 platforms due to its speed and low user fees. Data shows that applications built on the network locked over $320 million worth of cryptocurrencies in January 2022, which has increased to over $1 billion as of Tuesday.  Ethereum fees become prohibitively expensive for users during times of high network demand, with network fees touching as much as $9,000 per transaction during one such period earlier this year. This is why building on networks like Optimism allows DeFi projects to be more accessible to users, explained Dark Ghosty, integrations lead of Yearn Finance.  “We're excited about Optimism for the users who were priced out of yVaults on Ethereum,” he said. “With the additional liquidity flexibility that Iron Bank provides as a protocol-to-protocol lending partner, people can get the best risk-adjusted yield in DeFi without having to worry about high gas costs on a super-fast chain.”  Iron Bank said it would initially start to offer rewards for users that supply weighted ether (wETH), USDC and DAI assets, with approximately 11,500 iron bank (IB) tokens allocated for rewards over the next four weeks  Additionally, Iron Bank has initiated a bug bounty and insurance campaign with ImmuneFI and Nexus Mutual. The campaign will focus on the prevention of potential exploits against user funds, assets, and data breach vulnerabilities.

Launched earlier this year, aUSD successfully held its soft peg to the U.S. dollar until the hack. After the attack, the price of aUSD plunged from roughly $1.03 per token to $0.009.  The peg was nearly regained Tuesday following the token burns, reaching 93 cents at writing time.  Acala held a community vote Monday that proposed burning the 1.2 billion aUSD tokens to counteract the effects of Sunday's exploit. Prices of its aUSD tokens fell 99% after exploiters minted the tokens and drained funds from Acala’s iBTC/aUSD liquidity pool.  A liquidity pool is a digital pile of cryptocurrency locked in a smart contract, which results in creating liquidity for faster transactions on decentralized exchanges (DEX) and DeFi protocols.  Over 99% of the exploited aUSD remained on Acala and a small proportion has been swapped for ACA and other tokens and transferred out from Acala parachain, developers said in a community forum post on Monday.  The Twitter account @alice_und_bob estimated that the ""damage"" was $0 to $10 million, ""likely around 1.6M USD with a chance of recovery,” as previously reported.

Bitcoin Falls Below $24K Before Recovering Slightly; Ether Drops  By James Rubin  Bitcoin seemed headed for a bright start to the week, topping $25,000 late Sunday (U.S. time) after flirting with the psychologically important threshold multiple times in previous days.  But the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization quickly retreated and was recently trading just over $24,000, down almost a percentage point over the last 24 hours, albeit still above the top part of the $20,000 to $24,000 range it's occupied for over a month. Investors remain in wait-and-see mode following weeks of sometimes hopeful and other times confounding economic indicators and company earnings.  ""It seems the cryptocurrency, like many other instruments, is testing a potentially significant barrier following the recent recovery and we may be seeing some profit-taking,"" Craig Erlam, senior market analyst, U.K. and EMEA (Europe, Middle East, Africa) for foreign exchange Oanda, wrote in an email. ""Whether that becomes a full rotation lower isn't clear yet but it doesn't appear to have the momentum for a breakout at this time.  Ether followed a similar pattern, rising to over $2,000 late Sunday before falling below $1,900. The second-largest crypto by market cap was recently down roughly 2.5% from the previous day, although well above levels earlier this summer amid growing investor enthusiasm for The Merge, which will change the Ethereum protocol from proof-of-work to the faster, more energy efficient proof-of-stake model. Two of Sunday's big winners, the popular meme coins SHIB and DOGE, were losers a day later, recently plunging more than 9% and 7%, respectively. MATIC tumbled more than 5%.  Equities trade sideways  Stocks fared somewhat better than major cryptos, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 increasing 0.6% and 0.4%, respectively, amid ongoing hope that inflation has peaked and the U.S. Federal Reserve may be able to back off some of its current monetary hawkishness. But commodity prices declined after a number of indicators showed slowing growth in China. The price of Brent crude oil, a widely regarded measure of the energy market, dropped over 3% to about $95 per barrel.  ""The economic data from China overnight was very disappointing, to put it mildly,"" Erlam wrote. ""Combined with the lending figures on Friday, it does not paint a good picture of domestic demand or the growth outlook.""  Crypto news  A scotched deal between cryptocurrency custody company BitGo and crypto-focused financial services firm Galaxy Digital highlighted Monday's industry news. Earlier in the day, Galaxy Digital, the creation of noted investor Michael Novogratz, said it was abandoning its plan to purchase BitGo because the latter had failed to provide financial statements by an end-of-July deadline. The companies had first announced the deal in May 2021 for what was at the time about $1.2 billion in stock and cash.  Later Monday, BitGo said it was planning to sue Galaxy Digital for backing out of the merger agreement, and will seek $100 million in damages from Galaxy, the amount of a previously promised break-up fee.  The Federal Reserve announced it was publishing its final guidance for novel financial institutions to access its ""master accounts,"" something these firms need to participate in the global payment system. The announcement would seemingly move the U.S. central bank one step closer to possibly allowing Wyoming trust companies, like Custodia and Kraken Bank, access to these accounts.  European digital bank Revolut has been granted authorization by the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission, allowing it to offer crypto services across the European Economic Area. The authorization will enable Revolut to offer crypto services to its 17 million customers.  And Singapore's High Court granted beleaguered crypto exchange Zipmex more than three months of creditor protection so that Zipmex can devise a funding plan, Bloomberg News reported.  Decoupling from macro events?  Arca Chief Investment Officer Jeff Dorman optimistically noted evidence of a decoupling between crypto prices and macroeconomic events. ""The coincidental timing of idiosyncratic digital asset events (LUNA/UST, defaults/bankruptcies, ETH 2.0 Merge) and macro events (peak inflation, commodities rolling over, bad economic data leading to 'bad news = good news') makes it difficult to prove the decoupling,"" Dorman wrote in a Monday newsletter. ""But if you look elsewhere in digital assets, there has been massive dispersion in digital asset prices since mid-June.""  He added: ""All the market leaders that released big news/partnerships/tokenomics changes ultimately rallied the most (UNI, DYDX, LDO, ETH, CRV, AAVE, MATIC, CHZ, etc.). This is a very encouraging sign that digital assets are once again trading on their own information flows rather than being 100% tied to macro events.""

Too Bad, It’s in the Terms and Conditions  Earlier this month, Singapore-based crypto savings platform Hodlnaut froze withdrawals and token swaps citing “difficult market conditions.”  Naturally, its user base was aghast and the legal threats came in fast and furious over Twitter. At the time, Holdnaut was applying for a license from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (it has since withdrawn the application), and surely this isn’t the type of behavior becoming of a licensed institution.  Except this is all laid out in the terms and conditions, and Singapore courts may favor upholding this contractual agreement.  “The standard terms and conditions of the crypto lenders will usually provide it with a broad and absolute discretion to suspend all, or any part, of its services to its customers,” Yuankai Lin, partner at RPC Premier Law Singapore told CoinDesk via email. “In Hodlnaut's case, it did have a contractual right under its standard Terms and Conditions to ‘suspend or terminate the Service or any part of the Service, at its discretion and without prior notice to the User.’”  Lin said that, like any other digital service, the user would need to indicate their acceptance to open an account and this agreement would be binding on them.  As for any legal challenge, this might not go anywhere. Lin said this has been tried before in the TradFi world, and the courts have ruled on the side of the institution.  “The Singapore courts will generally recognize and uphold contractual terms giving the bank absolute discretion in relation to certain acts, provided that the bank exercises this discretion in good faith and not arbitrarily or irrationally. Any party seeking to challenge the bank's act will essentially have to prove the bank had abused its discretion,” he said to CoinDesk.  Lin said that while there have not been any reported decisions in Singapore on crypto lenders specifically exercising their discretion to freeze funds, he expects the same framework of discretion from TradFi to be applied.  As of now, MAS has been focused on regulating crypto from an anti-money laundering and combating terror financing perspective.  “MAS has stated that it will look towards widening the scope of cryptocurrency regulations in Singapore to cover more areas such as consumer protection, market conduct, and reserve backing for stablecoins,” Lin told CoinDesk.  Without a license from MAS, Holdnaut won’t be able to offer token swap services. It can however still offer lending and borrowing services for cryptocurrency-related transactions, Lin explained, as it is not an activity currently regulated by the MAS.  Holdnaut has not applied for bankruptcy protection unlike other CeFi lenders Celsius Network and Voyager Digital. The company has previously announced that it has ""no exposure or loans"" with Three Arrows Capital or Celsius.  Per previous CoinDesk reporting the lender is working with Singapore-based law firm Damodara Ong on a timeline for a plan to preserve user assets.  Hodlnaut has said on Twitter that it plans to provide another update to users on August 19.

In the last 24 hours however, the coin moved down on its chart. The meme-coin had broken past its cup and handle pattern that was being formed for the past several months. This had pointed towards signs of bullishness. Despite a fall in Shiba Inu price, the technical outlook of the coin continued to remain positive at the time of writing. If Shiba Inu manages to remain above the $0.000015 level then the meme-coin could trade near the $0.000021 price mark. This meant that Shiba Inu price could rally by almost 50% in the upcoming days. Buying strength remained strong for the meme-coin. There needs to remain considerable buying strength in the market for Shiba to maintain its uptrend. This rally happened after Binance announced that it will add SHIB support on the payment cards which are issued in Europe.
