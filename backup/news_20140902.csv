42426001,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhpNh,1409695231,Armory to Match 10 BTC in Donations to Hal Finney Bitcoin Fund,"Armory Technologies has extended its ongoing donation drive in honor of late bitcoin developer Hal Finney.  Finney, a pioneer in the field of cryptography and the first person to receive a bitcoin transaction, passed away last Tuesday at the age of 58 after a long battle with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).  The open-source bitcoin wallet management platform announced today that it would match up to 10 BTC in donations made to the Hal Finney Bitcoin Fund for ALS Research through its 'simulfunding' (simultaneous funding) platform.  Originally scheduled to end 1st September, the donation drive is also aimed to highlight the bitcoin contract capabilities of its version 0.92 Armory client.  Armory laudedFinney and his contributions to the wider bitcoin ecosystem in its blog post announcing the expansion of its funding drive, saying:  ""[Finney] was a true crypto pioneer whose ideals were completely in line with Armory's and we're happy to do anything we can to support ALS research.""  Launched on 30th August, the fund is accepting donations through to Thanksgiving (27th November) in the US with the goal of contributing the final total to the ALS Association, a US-based non-profit that raises money for research and patient services.  At press time, 7.5 BTC (or roughly $3,352) has been raised through contributions made to Armory's bitcoin donation matching initiative, meaning 15 BTC in total has been collected for its original recipient projects.  Simulfunding in action  The donation drive provides Armory with its latest opportunity to showcase its simulfunding interface, a feature of its latest client that allows users to create a simple bitcoin contract for use in crowdfunding, donation drives and personal agreements.  Armory's platform allows users to create or claim promissory notes and add them to their wallet management system. The promissory note, in turn, provides the conditions under which both parties will make a certain transaction – in this case, a contribution to a funding effort.  When the specified amount of funds is raised, the contract executes and all funds are transferred as described in the contract. However, contracts with terms that are not met are not executed.  The news also follows the formal unveiling of the Hal Finney Bitcoin Fund for ALS Research last weekend. The fund was created through a joint effort by Coinapult co-founder Erik Voorhees, Sean's Outpost founder Jason King, venture capitalist Roger Ver, BitPay, and the Bitcoin Foundation  Armory's drive continues  Launched on 29th July, Armory's simulfunding demo aimed to highlight one of the platform's newest capabilities. Armory also recently released Lockbox, a multi-signature interface for bitcoin, in the same update.  At the outset, the initiative offered up to 20 BTC to a list of charities selected for promoting ""open-source and digital freedoms"", including the Free Software Foundation; Electronic Frontier Foundation; College Cryptocurrency Network; OpenSSL; the Chamber of Digital Commerce; and the Bitcoin Foundation.  There, users can find a list of the available promissory notes being offered by Amory users, along with those that have been matched by the community.  To access simulfunding, users need to install Armory version 0.92. More detailed instructions on signing up for the service or updating an existing Armory wallet can be found on Armory's donation matching page.

42426002,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhpJh,1409681746,KnCMiner Launches Cloud Mining Service at Arctic Bitcoin Mine,"KnCMiner has unveiled a new cloud-mining service, offering six-month contracts out of its Arctic bitcoin mine.  KnC Cloud  , launched on 2nd September, leverages the company’s existing data center space in northern Sweden. The so-called Clear Sky mine boasts more than 7 petahashes per second in estimated mining power.  KnCMiner said the program will benefit from the cheap cooling and local renewable energy sources afforded by the Arctic Circle. These geographical advantages have led many companies in the bitcoin mining space to look to the Arctic, potentially establishing the region as a key battleground in the race to generate bitcoins.  KnCMiner director of marketing and public relations Nanok Bie told CoinDesk that the launch reflects a demographic shift taking place among the bitcoin community, with more miners opting to outsource their hashing power rather than operate home mining rigs.  He noted:  “We're launching cloud services because of shifts in the market and demand from would-be customers. Home mining is becoming more and more difficult because of energy costs etc. Having your mining in the cloud has obvious advantages – we can source green electricity cheaper for instance, and have other bulk advantages.”  Next-generation services  The KnC Cloud service consists of three different packages between 1 and 3 TH/s, with the cost averaging between $1.99 per GH/s to $1.79 per GH/s, respectively. According to the company, the hosting costs account for any mining-related fees and reflect the actual price of the service.  Bie explained that the service is indicative of how next-generation mining services may evolve in the months and years ahead, with offerings including more sophisticated resources and value-added services driven by demand.  He told CoinDesk:  “We think our offerings will stand out over the long run, as customers don't have to stand in line in an auction, don't have to worry about the Chinese renminbi currency exchange versus USD or BTC to calculate costs going forward and we're also not offering strange products where the users don't know where they are mining, if they are mining at all etc. Our fees can not rise over time as there are no fees.”  Like other cloud hosting solutions in the mining space, KnC Cloud offers a proprietary user interface that provides tools for miner configuration and balance management, as well as data for performance analysis.  Product expansion continues  The launch of its new cloud hosting follows a string of announcements from the Sweden-based mining company.  Earlier this month, the company said that its Titan line of scrypt miners had entered the final stages of production and that it was moving to the testing phase at its facilities. At the time, KnCMiner clarified the unit’s final projected hashing power as well as its expected power requirements.  KnCMiner’s software offerings also received an update this week. Joining a growing list of companies that opt to use the denomination, KnCMiner announced on 27th August that its mobile wallet app would use 'bits' instead of BTC.  The summer hasn’t been entirely rosy for the company, however.  In June, KnCMiner took to social media to defend itself against a rising customer backlash regarding its policies. Customers accused the company of reneging on earlier promises related to its then-delayed Neptune line of bitcoin miners.

42425987,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhovh,1409675717,Why Bitcoin's Gambling Boom is Only Just Getting Started,"Gambling is big business, and online gambling represents a significant and growing proportion of that business – about 8% currently.  Research company H2 Gambling Capital, which values the online gambling market in terms of gross winnings, put the global market value at €21.73bn ($28.54bn) in 2012. Furthermore, the firm expects a 9.13% compound annual growth rate through 2015.  Right now bitcoin gambling only accounts for a tiny percentage of the total of online gambling revenues. However, it is clear that the opportunity exists to make significant income within the industry and, with bitcoin's advantages in terms of low-cost, speedy payments, cryptocurrency-based gambling firms are doing their best to do just that.  CoinDesk spoke to some of the bitcoin gambling community’s experts to see what challenges they’re encountering along the way.  Wide-open market  The bitcoin world loves to gamble, in one form or another. In his book, The Anatomy of a Money-like Informational Commodity, Tim Swanson points out that half the transactions on the bitcoin network were being used to transmit bets to SatoshiDice, one of the earliest bitcoin betting sites, created by Eric Voorhees.  Further, an analysis in August 2013 showed that roughly 5% of the value of all bitcoin transactions in June that year were flowing through SatoshiDice. That means lots of very small transactions, which is, after all, one thing that cryptocurrencies are very good at.  Ivan Montik, CEO at SoftSwiss, provides online casino software for entrepreneurs, and its solutions support fiat and bitcoin gambling. “We’ve got about 400 requests for the launch of a bitcoin casino in the last six months,” he said. “We constantly have three to five casinos in the set-up phase, and could have had more if we had more resources.”  Not all bitcoin bets are low in value. Montik said that there are some high rollers in crypto-land:  “On one client website, launched just about a year ago, there are single wagers reaching 200–400 BTC. The total amount of bitcoins wagered on all of the sites operating with the SoftSwiss platform is equal to $10m per month.”  The regulation challenge  Cryptocurrency’s success in this market depends on several factors. One of the most important is regulation and, notably, SatoshiDice doesn’t operate in the US market, because of the strict gambling laws encountered there.  In 2006, the US Justice Department introduced the Unlawful Internet Gaming Enforcement Act (UIGEA), designed to quell the rising tide of Internet gambling sites. It made it illegal for US players to process payments using US banks.  In April 2011, the US government raided the three most popular online poker sites operating there, in an event known as 'Black Friday'. This had a chilling effect on online poker sites in the country.  Bitcoin, however, has emboldened some entrepreneurs, who are openly allowing US players to gamble using the cryptocurrency. One of these is Seals with Clubs, managed by seasoned poker player Bryan Micon.  “It would be trivial to circumvent some ban. Seals is open to the world. There’s no banking at all done on the site. It’s a pure bitcoin poker site, so this is a totally brand new thing,” said Micon. ”It’s only been a few years for the legal world and there’s nothing at all that says anything about this protocol.”  There are also signs that individual states are softening their approaches to online gambling, in any case. Delaware has allowed online gambling, as have New Jersey and Nevada. The latter state has also passed a law enabling it to form partnerships with other states to let their residents gamble in its online casinos.  Slowly, then, things seem to be opening up in the US, which is creating a more positive environment for cryptocurrency gambling sites that are already operating there, anyway.  The importance of innovation  Another thing working in cryptocurrency’s favour is the innovative nature of its community. The cryptocurrency concept is itself entirely new, built on the cryptography–based decentralised autonomous networking principles introduced by Satoshi. In such an innovative environment, is not surprising that new technologies and gaming models have sprung up.  Adrian Scholz, founder of SatoshiBet.com, argued that the ‘dice’ gaming model on which sites like SatoshiDice were built is an example of such an innovation.  He said  “This game did not exist in online casinos before bitcoin, yet it turns out to be more popular then games like roulette and blackjack.”  There are other breakthroughs that came from the crypto gambling community. “Take Provably Fair, which created a trustless shuffling system,"" he said. ""Take HTML5. Most of the classic online casinos run games still require Flash or Java plugins.”  “Take investing! Just-dice introduced the concept of allowing players to be part of the bank, which turned out to be pretty much the ultimate marketing vehicle,” he concluded.  There are other areas of innovation, too. In particular, mobile gaming is becoming increasingly important.  Cloudbet  , formed in 2013, is a sportsbook and casino environment where players can deposit instantly, bet, and withdraw again as soon as bets are graded. The firm recently launched a mobile casino, and is preparing a mobile sportsbook.  “We’re now seeing that a lot of gaming industry experts are coming in with a wealth of gaming industry knowledge and experience,” said Cloudbet spokesperson Leandro Rossi, in an indication that the industry is maturing.  Challenges to overcome  There are still challenges for those wishing to start bitcoin casinos, however, and different experts see different threats.  Scholz singled out legislation as the biggest issue. “We saw major operators that were willing to introduce bitcoin (for example Vera&John held out because of the unclear state bitcoin is in,” he said. Although now, that casino has taken the taken the plunge.  Mitonik pointed to marketing as another significant problem. Effectively, as the space begins to fill out, it could become difficult for new entrants to make themselves heard above the noise.  He said:  “If you’ve never dealt with marketing before, you’d better prepare the budget and let professionals work on it.”  Mike Hadjuk, founder of Infiniti Poker, argued that security is the biggest problem. “Nobody is impermeable. Even the Pentagon can get hacked. To me that’s our number one concern,” he said.  Hadjuk is another example of an innovator in the cryptocurrency gambling space, having created a service that would allow players to view each other using live web cams.  The soft launch of his service was compromised by players creating multiple accounts and using them in combination to steal no-deposit credits. He is now preparing for a Q4 full launch.  Micon also highlighted security as an issue:  “It’s about keeping the bitcoin safe. That’s not just about securing cold storage – it goes beyond that. It’s about looking after issues such as automated cash-outs, to help sites scale without allowing criminals to take advantage of poorly configured scripts.  Seals with Clubs was hacked last December, and lost 42,000 passwords in the process. Micon explained that the team behind the site learned a lot from a security perspective. “No one lost their coins. We were able to drastically improve up to and beyond industry standards for our password table,” he said.  Educating users  Perhaps the biggest challenge for cryptocurrency gambling sites, though, is the uptake of bitcoin itself.  Cloudbet’s Rossi said:  “There is still a high educational barrier to entry. People can transact with Visa and MasterCard without understanding how the payment network works, but to transact with bitcoin there is still a requirement of technical knowledge.”  The company has launched mainstream campaigns to educate potential players about bitcoin, but this is something that the bitcoin community has to broach collectively, he indicated.  The good news for bitcoin gambling sites is that they are still early in the process, meaning that there is lots of room for disruption, said Micon:  “Some kid is going to come up with some bitcoin gambling game. They will be 12 years old and they’ll make $480,000. That’s just what’s possible.”  Possible, for sure. But with a few challenges along the way.

42425990,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhp3h,1409668524,MIT Bitcoin Project Names Final Winners of $15k App Contest,"The final winners of the summer-long bitcoin app development contest at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have been announced.  The grand prize of $5,000 went to the team behind Ethos, a platform for establishing and maintaining private online identification using the block chain. The team previously picked up prizes in the first and second rounds.  The MIT BitComp, first announced in June, offered $15,000 in cash prizes to spur development of bitcoin apps and get the campus more engaged with digital currency in the run-up to the fall semester. The MIT Bitcoin Project, which organized the competition, plans to distribute $100 in bitcoin to each undergraduate sometime this month.  In addition to the grand prize, five other awards valued at $1,500 were given to contest participants. These included the Awesome Award, which went to a social favor app called Fireflies that utilizes bitcoin.  Guy Zyskind, a member of the grand prize-winning Ethos development team that also included Amir Lazarovich, said in a statement that the promise of digital currency lies beyond its use as a payment system, noting:  “We believe bitcoin as a currency will quickly become mainstream in the coming years. That said, the real value behind bitcoin is its being a decentralized and trustless complex system. In many ways, bitcoin as an idea is an optimization to democracy using technology. As such, the future of bitcoin definitely holds far more interesting applications than the currency itself.”  Final winners detailed  Other projects were honored for their contributions to the contest.  The Next Billion Award is meant to honor the team that works to bring digital currency to emerging markets. The winner was Rex Mercury, a bitcoin-to-SMS gateway service designed to facilitate cross-border payments. The development team included Will Clurman, Michelle Higa Fox, Brett Ludwig, Allan Onyango and Matt Utterback.  BitStation, a wallet designed specifically for MIT students, picked up the Improving MIT Award. Mitchell Gu, Jiahao Li and Nelson Liu spearheaded the campus-focused project.  The Bitcoin Evangelism Award was given to the team behind Potlucky, an app that can be used to make simple, off-block chain transactions. Potlucky was designed by Nezar Abdennur, Ethan Heilman and Adam Tavares.  The contest also spotlit an implementation of CoinJoin, a bitcoin transaction anonymizer built by MIT senior Brandon Miranda. Fireflies, the task-sharing application that won the Awesome Award, was created by Samuel Udotong and Om Mahida.  Foundation for bitcoin growth  The BitComp intends to get MIT-based developers thinking about using bitcoin in the run-up to the distribution set for the fall semester. A number of teams submitted proposals to the contest, open to all members of the university’s community.  The event is also part of a broader effort to integrate digital currency within MIT. Earlier this summer, the MIT Bitcoin Project organized the university's Bitcoin Expo, which attracted hundreds of community members and featured Bitcoin Foundation chief scientist Gavin Andresen and Circle co-founder and CTO Sean Neville.  As for the project winners, many of the developers said that they plan to continue building on the work they started this summer. As the team behind Fireflies noted, the next step is making it easier for these services to take root at MIT, which includes helping students spend their $100 in bitcoin.

42426003,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhpPh,1409653780,Switzerland's Largest University Tests 'Touchless' Bitcoin Payments Solution,"Switzerland's University of Zurich is integrating a student-made bitcoin payments solution into one of its cafeterias as part of a two-week trial.  Called CoinBlesk, the mobile payments platform uses two-way near-field communication (NFC) technology and was developed as part of a student project to create an open-source bitcoin spending tool.  Students will be able to load their CoinBlesk wallets online or at a new bitcoin ATM that will be installed at the university.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Professor Dr Burkhard Stiller, who served as the project's advisor, described how the two offerings will work together on campus:  ""The bitcoin ATM makes the trial phase easier for people willing to pay with NFC-based bitcoin transactions, since they can buy them locally.""  The bitcoin ATM, which was manufactured by BitAccess, will be operated by Switzerland-based bitcoin broker SBEX and installed near Mensa UZH Binzmühle, the dining facility that will accept bitcoin payments for the promotion.  Student project takes flight  While it is just now seeing its formal launch, CoinBlesk is the result of months of effort from a nine-member group of both university doctoral students and faculty members.  In addition to Stiller, the university's Dr Thomas Bocek also worked as a project coordinator and developer. Bocek told CoinDesk that the project stemmed from a lecture he gave in 2013 addressing the subject of a bitcoin payments system where the cashier is able to easily send a bitcoin buyer a payment request.  However, Bocek indicated that it was three motivated students who took the idea forward, approaching him about turning it into a project.  Bocek said that while original NFC testing proved difficult, Google's introduction of host card emulation (HCE) technology finally gave his team the technology it needed to realize its ideas. He added:  ""This application was tested in an early test run in February 2014, but few Google devices had Android 4.4 at that time. We learned a lot from this test run and we focused further work in the following areas: improving our NFC payment protocol and improving the user interface.""  The resulting product aims to provide an easier point-of-sale (POS) experience for both consumers and merchants. For example, because it leverages NFC, only one party needs to be connected to the Internet for a transaction to take place. A more in-depth overview of how the service works can be found on the project's official website.  Budding relationship  While the launch is exciting for the university, is also marks the most recent success for Geneva-based bitcoin startup SBEX.  SBEX recently received approval from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) to install a fleet of domestic bitcoin ATMs after reporting initial difficulties.  Romain Braud, head of business development at SBEX, told CoinDesk that the project has enjoyed support from the university, and that as such, his company extended a unique offer to the institution given the pivotal role it could play in raising bitcoin awareness.  Noting that he has been impressed both with the university and its students, Braud said:  ""We made a special deal with them because we trust it's a great project that it can be in the future in all universities of Switzerland.""  Although Braud confirmed that there are no immediate plans for the university to expand its bitcoin payments initiative, he added that discussions with the university are ongoing.

42425994,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhpBh,1409651944,Huobi's Fixed-Return Financial Product Sells Out in One Hour,"Huobi has sold all available subscriptions to a new 60-day fixed-term financial product for bitcoin investors.  The latest product from the Beijing-based exchange, which is effectively a bitcoin 'certificate of deposit', is called 'Dig-VC' and offers a guaranteed interest rate for investors. Notably, returns are backed by Digcoin – a new bitcoin mining services platform built by Huobi.  Both will form part of Huobi's Hong Kong-based trading and investment platform BitVC, which launched in June.  Dig-VC subscribers will see a guaranteed return of 1.2% per month (which equates to an annualised rate of 16%), calculated on a daily basis and paid at maturity. Additionally, the first 100 subscribers will be rewarded with an additional 0.2% per month at the end of the 60-day term.  The interest-bearing product differs from 'cloud mining' shares offered by other companies, in that subscribers are not purchasing shares of the hashing power with return rates that vary according to the growth of the network. Instead, Dig-VC promises a simpler investment with a fixed return rate.  Already oversubscribed  Huobi describes Dig-VC as ""an attractive new high-yield, low-risk financial product"" and offered 2,000 subscriptions for 1 BTC each, beginning this morning China time.  A company representative told CoinDesk all the shares were sold within the first hour, with more than half sold in the first two minutes. There was also a large amount of international interest:  ""It looks like 70% of investors were from China with the rest coming from the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan, Singapore, and Thailand.""  Users may buy or sell shares even during the 60-day term period, or join a queue to do so if no buy or sell offers are available. Sellers who cannot find interested buyers must hold their shares to maturity.  The Digcoin project  Digcoin is raising investment to significantly increase its overall hashing power. It currently stands at 1.3 PH/s (petahashes per second), or 2.5% of the bitcoin network's global hash rate. It is seeking to raise that power to 4 PH/s.  It will likely begin to offer more 'traditional' cloud mining shares in the near future.  Digcoin has arrangements with Chinese mining equipment manufacturers Avalon and AsicMiner, among others. It is part of the Discus Fish mining pool and sends funds to a publicly released address. At current strength it mines about 28 BTC per day.  While Huobi could not confirm the exact location of the Digcoin mining facility, photos posted on its own information page look very similar to those from a recent reporthttp://www.thecoinsman.com/2014/08/bitcoin/inside-one-worlds-largest-bitcoin-mines/ on this large-scale bitcoin mining facility in rural China.  New investment and storage products  Like other Asian bitcoin exchanges, Huobi has been reaching out to professional investors and traders with a series of products more familiar to the traditional financial world.  It launched BitVC in August, offering derivatives and margin trading to all customers, coupled with 'Yubibao' wallets for eager depositors to make their funds available as leverage to the professional traders. Yubibao accounts (available in both bitcoin and litecoin) earn their holders with a small rate of interest (around 0.017%) paid on a daily basis.  Huobi reports that BitVC has seen new user growth of around 20% per month since launch, and it now accounts for 18% of all Huobi bitcoin trading and 28% of litecoin trading.  Huobi also acquired the multi-signature bitcoin wallet service QuickWallet in August. Customers with accounts at any of Huobi's stable of services may move funds between them instantly, and without incurring fees.  Together with competitors OKCoin and BTC China, Huobi recently completed an audit of its bitcoin reserves that showed it held more than 103% of the bitcoins its records showed.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MINING,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/09/02/huobis-fixed-return-financial-product-sells-out-in-one-hour,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/de0b56570df8c2c3d67471f2dd147f79684ec299-1774x881.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
