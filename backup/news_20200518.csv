42404628,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdjXet,1589839528,Developers of Ethereum Privacy Tool Tornado Cash Smash Their Keys,"Ethereum’s premier coin mixing service is now permissionless.      Tornado Cash, a privacy tool for obfuscating the history of ether (ETH) transactions, completed a cryptographic process known as a trusted setup ceremony on May 10 followed by a contract update on Monday to create perpetually self-executing code.      “With a record 1,114 contributions this was by far the largest Trusted Setup Ceremony to date,” Tornado Cash wrote in a May 13 blog post. “By comparison, all other trusted setup ceremonies had less than 200 participants.”      The ceremony, relying on a cryptographic method known as multi-party computation (MPC), makes Tornado Cash “completely trustless and unstoppable,” co-founder Roman Storm said in an interview with CoinDesk.      Read more: MPC Explained: The Bold New Vision for Securing Crypto Money      Tornado Cash v1 first launched in August 2019 but remained an audited “experimental software” because the developers retained control over user funds through a multi-sig wallet.      With v2, all that is gone. The MPC and Monday’s contract update effectively break up the developer key by creating a crowdsourced smart contract without a private key.    Private transactions    Techwise, Tornado Cash leans on zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP), or mathematical evidence that a transaction occurred without revealing the information within the payment itself.      Tornado Cash joins two other ZKP-based Ethereum systems, Aztec and EY’s Nightfall. As reported by CoinDesk, privacy protocol Aztec launched a network on Ethereum for digital assets, beginning with dai, while EY also released a business-focused privacy solution for Ethereum transactions in October 2018.      Read more: Zcash Alliance Aims to Bring Privacy Tech to Bitcoin, Cosmos and Ethereum      Tornado Cash is more readily compared to existing coin mixers on Bitcoin because of its retail focus. CoinJoin developers Samourai and Wasabi have brought mixing to retail bitcoin investors, with Samourai available on Google Play as of February (a feature coming in Tornado Cash’s v3, Storm said).      Of course, there are other cryptocurrencies that only focus on privacy solutions, led by zcash (ZEC) and monero (XMR). The Electric Coin Company (ECC), a for-profit firm behind zcash’s development, is currently working on a bridge between itself and the Ethereum blockchain for enabling private transactions.    Just how private?    For Tornado Cash, two questions remain: How many people will use it and how will regulators view it?      To the first, Samourai adoption after its mobile launch gives a positive signal. Bitcoin podcaster Matt Odell told CoinDesk the number of mixings on Samourai doubled month-over-month following the addition of mobile support.      That said, bitcoin (BTC) is often presented as a self-sovereign money alternative while ether’s prevailing use case has fluctuated.      Defining what ether is matters, particularly for Tornado Cash. The efficacy of a privacy protocol – from Zcash to Wasabi – is dependent on the number of users, called the anonymity set. Think of a ballpark crowd: If the stands are full of fans, it’s hard to pick out a singular person in the upper deck. Conversely, an empty stadium only helps frame the lone fanatic.      Maddie Kennedy, spokesperson for blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, said Tornado Cash may not be the solution privacy-focused users may think it is. “While mixers, CoinJoins and solutions like Tornado Cash can make tracing funds more difficult, Chainalysis can often still follow funds through them,” Kennedy told CoinDesk in an email.      That sentiment was echoed by former bitcoin core contributor Gavin Andresen in a November blog post on Tornado Cash, highlighting additional measures such as IP-address masking that most users don’t consider.      “I won’t be surprised if there is a paper at the Financial Cryptography 2023 conference showing that 85% of tornado usage was not private; not because the cryptography is broken, but because it is really hard for mere mortals to use something like tornado (or CoinJoin or other similar technologies) in a way that doesn’t leak information about their wallet,” Andresen wrote.    Compliance questions    There’s also compliance concerns, with the verdict still out on whether mixers are money transmitters or not.      In an email, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) told CoinDesk that mixers such as Tornado Cash could fall under the definition of a money transmitter, and therefore have “obligations” set by the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA).      For his part, Tornado Cash’s Storm said that now that the trusted setup has occurred, little can be pinned on the developers: self-executing code is self-executing code.      Read more: Binance Blockade of Wasabi Wallet Could Point to a Crypto Crack-Up      That doesn’t mean Storm and co-founder Roman Semenov are wanting to venture beyond the wake. In fact, Tornado Cash included a compliance feature with v2 to counter some regulatory concerns. The new version will include a cryptographic “note” which can prove to anyone presented the transaction’s history. The feature was added in light of reports of crypto exchanges freezing accounts of users who possessed coins with mixed histories.      Storm also pointed to the ECC's and Zcash Foundation’s friendly relationship with U.S. regulators despite the cryptocurrency’s focus on privacy.      “We are in a little bit of a different situation [than other mixer wallets]. I think for us it’s very important to become compliant,” Storm said. “We do what we feel is right.”",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH | XMR | ZEC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | XMR | ZEC,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/05/18/developers-of-ethereum-privacy-tool-tornado-cash-smash-their-keys,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/22529641648f9c2163e5acfec41c123d87e4139a-2560x1920.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404642,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdjXsf,1589835137,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Stuck in High $9K Range as Stocks Soar on Powell Comments,"Bitcoin treaded water in the high $9,000 range Monday as stocks rallied and traders wondered when the cryptocurrency would break the five-digit barrier again.      Stocks, meanwhile, got a boost a day after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell talked about continued stimulus efforts for the U.S. economy during a television interview Sunday.      At $9,673 as of 20:30 UTC (4:30 p.m. ET), bitcoin (BTC) was trading down less than a percent over 24 hours. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was close to its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a technical indicator signaling the price is likely to remain flat in the near term.      While bitcoin hit $9,958 in early trading on exchanges like Coinbase, it dropped as low as $9,436 and has climbed as high as $9,700 since 16:00 UTC (12 p.m. ET).      Bitcoin briefly topped $10,000 on May 7 but has not reached such heights since. However, traders are eagerly awaiting a return to five digits because would signal positive momentum, said Josh Rager, a crypto trader and founder of learning platform Blackroots.      “Bitcoin performed well starting in late April, right before halving, so you can't expect it to keep running up without some proper sideways action,” Rager said, referring to the much-anticipated, once-in-four-years reduction in regular issuance that took place May 11. “I think if bitcoin can get a close on the daily or weekly above $10,500 that it would be very bullish.”      As bitcoin ambled along, the big boost to the stock markets took center stage Monday. The exuberance, irrational or otherwise, seems to have come thanks to Fed Chair Powell, who said the U.S. will continue to take unprecedented action to thwart the economic damage from the coronavirus pandemic.      “The good news is that we have policies that can go some way toward minimizing those effects,” said Powell during a television interview with ""60 Minutes."" “And that's by keeping people and businesses out of insolvency just for maybe three or six more months while the health authorities do what they can do.”      “We can buy time with that. And so I think that kind of support may be appropriate,” Powell added.      Read more: Bitcoin’s 2020 Rally Sends Message to Capitalists      Stocks also got a boost from optimism about a coronavirus vaccine from Nasdaq-traded biotechnology company Moderna. While Asia’s Nikkei 225 was flat in early trading, up less than 1%, the FTSE Eurotop index of largest companies was up an ebullient 4%. The S&P 500 in the U.S. climbed 3%, bouncing back from the past week’s poor performance, its worst since late March.      Unlike in March, when bitcoin performance appeared to be correlated with stocks, a very strong day for equities doesn’t seem to be helping the digital asset, and getting past that $10,000 psychological barrier might be tough.      Constain Kogan, a partner at crypto fund BitBull Capital said that “$9,800 seems the top for the moment. So we might see a bottom of this consolidating trend, which is around $9,250-$9,300.”      However, Henrik Kugelberg, a Sweden-based over-the-counter crypto trader, predicted bitcoin’s lackluster performance won’t last. “I’d say the pressure has been building since the start of the year,” he told CoinDesk.      Kugelberg invoked the scarcity thesis, the concept of a limit to the amount of bitcoin produced, as a reason to remain bullish.

Losers in 24-hour trading include decred (DCR) slipping 1.5% and stellar (XLM) down 1%. All price changes were as of 20:30 UTC (4:30 p.m. ET) Monday.

The little-known firm, formerly known as Bitcoin Manipulation Abatement and controlled by Pavel Pogodin, filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on Saturday, alleging that HDR Global Trading, the parent company of BitMEX, perpetrated a vast racketeering conspiracy designed to reap billions in illegal profit.      This plot featured wire fraud, money laundering, unlicensed money transmission, interstate transport of stolen property and violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, BMA alleges.      See also: Mysterious Company Files New Lawsuit Over Ripple’s $1.1B XRP Sale      In a statement, an HDR spokesperson said the company was aware of the complaint, “which is clearly rehashed from information culled from the internet,” and that it would be defending itself “vigorously against this spurious claim.”      “BMA has recently emerged as a serial filer of claims against companies operating in the cryptocurrency space, and is widely recognised for operating just like a patent troll,” the statement added. “We will deal with this complaint through a normal litigation process and are entirely confident the court will see the claim for what it is.”      BitMEX’s failure to secure a money transmitter licence and its ties to U.S. customers means it processed $3 billion in illicit finances each day, BMA alleges, “which is the record volume for such unlawful activity in the entire history of the monetary regulation in the United States.”      BMA also alleges BitMEX manipulated the cryptocurrency markets by artificially boosting the price of bitcoin. The exchange allegedly traded against customers, tied its futures indices to illiquid spot market exchanges that it would then manipulate and capitalized on its schemes with staged “technical glitches” that prevented customers from exiting their positions.      Plaintiff fired shots over BitMEX’s 100x leverage trading options and said founder Arthur Hayes was “cryptocurrency’s P.T. Barnum.”      See also: BitMEX Is Making Bitcoin Network More Expensive for Everyone, Researcher Finds      “Describing trading on cryptocurrency as ‘the entertainment business,’ [Hayes] has embraced a role as showman and promoter for the ‘degenerate gamblers he solicits, and encourages speculative trading by flaunting his lavish lifestyle and making bold predictions designed to elicit responses and move the market in a way that is profitable for BitMEX,” BMA claimed in the suit.      BMA and Pogodin have gone after cryptocurrency headliners before. In November BMA targeted FTX on accusations of price manipulation before voluntarily dismissing its case just over a month later.

42404634,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdjXnk,1589827676,Bitcoin Demand Pushes Tether Below $1 for Longest Stretch Since March,"Tether, the oldest and largest stablecoin tied to the U.S dollar, has fallen below par value for the longest stretch since bitcoin hit 12-month lows in March. Tether maintained or exceeded par value consistently during bitcoin’s subsequent two-month rally.      The cryptocurrency, also known as USDT, dipped below $1 on Friday and has stayed below that mark as of press time Monday, according to data from exchanges Kraken and OkCoin, which support two of the largest USDT/USD markets by volume. Bittrex and FTX, which also support the trading pair, showed similarly discounted tether prices.      One possible explanation for the price dip is persistently strong buying pressure for bitcoin, especially on futures markets. Tether is typically used as a stand-in for U.S. dollars on crypto exchanges, a currency for buying other assets rather than an investment. Big shifts in demand can cause tether to temporarily deviate from its peg.      Read more: As Tether Supply Hits Record Highs, It Moves Away From Original Home      For instance, the bellwether stablecoin spiked as high as $1.03 on Kraken in early March when bitcoin fell to 12-month lows amid market-wide bitcoin selling.      “Bitcoin futures are at premiums, indicating buy pressure,” said Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of FTX, an exchange that also supports a USDT/USD market. “That can drive up BTC/USDT and so drive down USDT, especially on margin exchanges,” he explained.      Tether’s dip below $1 coincides with a brief respite of new token issuances. “We've seen really strong USDT inflows for months unrelated to BTC price movements, and it's possible those are tapering off,” said Bankman-Fried.      Over the past two months, Tether Ltd. issued over 3.5 billion new tokens, an average of roughly 60 million tethers per day, according to Coin Metrics data. Since Thursday, however, tether’s market capitalization, a proxy for supply since it’s ostensibly redeemable for $1, decreased by $7 million.      Read more: Stablecoin Supply Breaks $10B as Traders Demand Dollars Over Bitcoin      Compared to previous price fluctuations, however, Tether’s latest dip could be a non-event, falling below par at most by only one tenth of a cent at the time of publication. The steepest discount in recent history occurred in late April 2019 when USDT dipped more than 3% below par, which coincided with a suit against Tether and Bitfinex by the New York Attorney General’s (NYAG) office pertaining to an alleged loss of $850 million by the exchange.",NEUTRAL,BTC | USDT,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | USDT,Zack Voell,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/18/bitcoin-demand-pushes-tether-below-1-for-longest-stretch-since-march,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fcbdc436265a2442c70af60394d883b587304a72-1000x750.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404632,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdjXgr,1589825707,"Uniswap V2 Launches With More Token-Swap Pairs, Oracle Service, Flash Loans","""Amulets"" might be a better word than ""tokens"" for some of the crypto assets emerging on blockchains today.      Version 2.0 of Uniswap is now live and it is, among other things, an amulet-minting machine, though probably everyone's still going to call them ""tokens."" Tokens are little more than keys that allow you to access something, such as a game or a laundry machine. Amulets have surprises inside; they can generate something new from within, for anyone with the skill to unlock them.      ""Version 1 was almost this like proof-of-concept,"" Hayden Adams, Uniswap's founder, told CoinDesk. ""It was the first implementation of this protocol. It got a lot of things very right. And that's proved by usage and traction.""      Uniswap is a system on Ethereum for trading any ERC-20 token for any other, using Ethereum's core cryptocurrency, ETH, as the medium of trade. It currently has $43 million of liquidity (assets locked into the protocol) with $13 million in activity on the platform in the last 24 hours, according to Uniswap.info. It's one of the key so-called ""financial primitives"" powering decentralized finance (DeFi).      But Adams believes the platform can be pushed a lot further. Uniswap v2 – which he described in a blog post in March – will work the same way as Uniswap v1, but it will take off its key limitation – running all token swaps through ETH. Plus it will add some new features, such as a new oracle system, that many other DeFi projects may find useful.    More amulets, stranger amulets      The headline feature of the new Uniswap will be the ability for anyone to create any token pair they want, so long as it exists on Ethereum.      This is likely to lead to unexpected use cases, but the most obvious use out of the box is a new way to use stablecoins. Popular ERC-20s like MKR, ZRX, WBTC, OMG and others are very likely to be quickly paired up with stablecoins, such as USDT, USDC and dai.      Coinbase has already added liquidity to the ETH/USDC pair on Uniswap v1, after all. ""Having stablecoin pairs on Uniswap is a pretty huge improvement. It's probably the most requested thing since Uniswap launched,"" Adams said.      Read more: Coinbase Pumps $1.1M USDC Into DeFi Sites Uniswap and PoolTogether      The top-line advantage of having a direct pair of any two tokens is it should lower transaction fees for trades (v1 always requires two trades between any two ERC-20s). Another advantage: It allows liquidity providers to lower their volatility on one side of a pool. A MKR/ETH pool is volatile on both ends, but a MKR/USDT pool should only be volatile on the MKR side. ""A lot of people don't want the ETH exposure,"" Adams said.      As mentioned above, these token pairs are created by users. If someone thinks WCK (wrapped CryptoKitties) and SOCKS (actual socks) should have a token pair, then they can set it up. Users pay a tiny fee to the liquidity pool for each trade (0.3%) and that ultimately goes back to liquidity providers (each gets it proportional to how much of the pool they have posted).      So returning to our amulet thesis: Any time someone contributes to a Uniswap pool, they get a token whose value grows as people use that pool. It's a token that represents value in two other tokens. It's like owning a deed to a piece of land that's growing beneath your feet.      Adams said he expects these liquidity-pool tokens to show up in other DeFi applications soon.    A crystal ball      Uniswap is also adding an oracle service, because the first job of any magician is to learn to see the unseen.      Uniswap isn't going to use these oracles but it's a way of improving the price signals the protocol already yields.      ""Uniswap basically is a price discovery mechanism at its core,"" Adams said.      While the company behind the protocol has never recommended Uniswap as a price oracle, projects do use it that way. Uniswap does a good job tracking the market; however, if a project needed the price at every block to really be on point, it's not safe right now.      ""There is this huge demand for oracles, and it's a very valuable thing to have an on-chain price feed, especially a decentralized one,"" Adams said.      Uniswap is adding a time-weighted oracle service (time-weighting makes shenanigans expensive) that can flexibly deliver average prices over any length of time. Adams expects many oracle-reliant projects will at least incorporate this feed into their data streams, if not relying on it entirely.      ""This is a service that Uniswap v2 provides to the world, and I think will indirectly benefit the Uniswap protocol,"" Adams said.    Flash loans      Uniswap is also adding flash loan functionality. Flash loans have been controversial but they really enable composability. Additionally, they have the benefit of only going through if everything works.      Flash loans permit a user to borrow any amount up to the total liquidity available, so long as the whole sum gets returned in the same transaction. A talented software developer can code up a bot to watch specific places in the market where prices get out of sync and take advantage of arbitrage opportunities, earning quick profit but also helping to restore equilibrium. With flash loans, traders don't even have to front the cost of running those trades.      Read more: The DeFi ‘Flash Loan’ Attack That Changed Everything      Flash loans also allow Uniswap users to make fewer transactions, thereby reducing fees. However, by creating a whole new use case with lower upfront costs, it should increase the number of fees that liquidity providers earn.      Again, assets that can leave and return in effectively the same moment but somehow someone out there got richer along the way? Amulets.    Magic mountain      Uniswap makes no income off its protocol. All the revenue goes back to liquidity providers. But it's a VC-backed project, with a seed round in April from Paradigm, so one would expect that there must be an intention to exit.      Uniswap v2 leaves an option open to redirect 0.05% of any trade to pay the protocol itself. Adams declined to say more about this than what he wrote in his original blog post: ""The best version of Uniswap will be one that autonomously incentivizes contributions to its own growth and development as well as to the broader ecosystem in which it exists.""      ""I'm a huge fan of automation first and governance absolutely last,"" he said in an interview. ""It's easier to rely on and trust math.""      Uniswap has had an impressive run. Roughly 18 months in, it entered basically the same space as Bancor, a token-swapping project that raised $150 million in an initial coin offering (ICO). Uniswap simplified the design by using ETH instead of a new ERC-20. When we last made the comparison in February 2019, Uniswap and Bancor were closely matched.      Today, DappRadar shows $213,000 in volume for Bancor over the last seven days and $38 million for Uniswap. Another third-party source, Dune Analytics, reports larger numbers for both projects, with Uniswap doing $67.8 million in volume and Bancor $3.2 million, over the last seven days.

The Thesis team cited a bug, but is not disclosing details until all funds have been safely withdrawn from this iteration of tBTC. Thesis is now helping early users withdraw any BTC that had been deposited.      The project lead behind the new system, Thesis CEO Matt Luongo, sent the following statement to CoinDesk via a spokesperson:    ""While the tBTC dapp was being tested over the weekend in its alpha version, a couple of community members put a few BTC into the contract before testing had concluded. Meanwhile, an issue in the dapp that was missed by our security audit was found by two of our contributors, and we decided to pause deposits for now to ensure the safety of funds. It is thanks to the strength and engagement of our community that this was identified quickly and all funds are safe.""    Luongo said the priority now was to further enhance the security of the system before announcing a timeline to re-deploy it. A new audit is being conducted by Trail of Bits; another auditor will also be enlisted and its bug bounty has been increased tenfold.      Luongo first announced that tBTC had been paused at 5:58 UTC on Monday. It had been live for two days. He credited a member of the Thesis team for finding the flaw, and Summa's James Prestwich for verifying it.      Luongo wrote later in the Twitter thread, ""Because the system is young and most minters are active community members, I think we can get this done in 1 to 2 days. Though we fixed the issue in code last night, we don't want to expose it until all funds are drained.""      Prestwich declined to comment. Luongo wrote on Twitter that a full post-mortem is forthcoming. A Thesis spokesperson told CoinDesk this will likely be released tomorrow.      Thesis has taken down the tBTC dapp to make the smart contract less accessible. As of this writing, Etherscan shows 7 tBTC minted, of a max of 11 BTC.      The security model for tBTC is described in its documentation. It delineates four things Thesis can do with its key to the smart contract. Among those, it can pause new deposits one time for 10 days. This is how Thesis stopped deposits Monday, but the option can only be used once.

42404640,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdjXqh,1589819182,The American Empire Is in Decline. Time for a New Economic System,"Lex Sokolin, a CoinDesk columnist, is Global Fintech co-head at ConsenSys, a Brooklyn, N.Y.-based blockchain software company. The following is adapted from his Fintech Blueprint newsletter.      The hard thing about abundance is making a choice. We live in a time of the broadest set of economic, social and political thinking, available to all at any time. But when the world's most important macroeconomic investor, Ray Dalio, publishes a deeply researched description of the money markets and a forward view of the impact on American Empire, all we have to do is listen and learn. It is all available here, for free.      What makes empires according to Ray? And what breaks them?      Dalio's Bridgewater team looked across time to the East and the West. In Europe, they tracked the British, Dutch and other colonial powers. In Asia, they analyzed the coming and going of Chinese dynasties. While the structure and organizing principles of the political super-organisms (i.e., the beehive) has changed drastically over millennia, human nature and DNA have not.      The data suggests empires last about 200 years. It all starts with education, which leads to innovation and productive competitiveness. Growing military power, funded by growing wealth, protects trade and financial flows that attach to a dominant power. After a rise and time lag of almost 100 years, the incumbent is crowned with the gift of a reserve currency – that financial superpower that allows it to print money. Yet, when that superpower is over-exercised, and investments in education and innovation erode away, debt cycles accumulate and collapse the whole endeavor. The biome is effectively destroyed.      Here is the tracking of empires in Dalio's study using a smoothed weighted average of the discussed attributes to create an index of power. Pay close attention to America in blue, Britain in black and China in red.      This is a fantastic amount of work, condensed into a clear visualization. Now, as the U.S. has to contend with the rise of China, it competes with a nation that has improving fundamental attributes (education, innovation) but not yet the reserve currency. The reserve currency allows its bearer to generate economic activity from thin air at the expense of the rest of the world. This brings us back on point to money, which is why you are reading this article.      The empire super-organism emerges as complexity out of the interaction of millions of individual human agents and the other organisms they form such as families, teams, companies and states (for more on what complexity really looks like, see my thoughts on Wolfram's theory of the universe). I think it is hard to create a deterministic model that describes complex systems without overshooting the truth with convenient narrative. But we do what we must, and it is better to have a rough compass to the truth than none at all.      When looking at the money part of empires, Ray sees two attributes of the ""machine."" The first is the regular expansion/contraction business cycle, lasting five to 10 years on average, driven by the extension of credit and its default. Like the human body drawing breath in and out, money flows into our pockets and out like a wave.    Credit is its own animal, and left unchecked unhinges from collateral to become mere imagination.    The second insight is to recognize a 50- to 100-year cycle of sovereign money. This is a cycle that switches between (1) hard money like gold, which has intrinsic redeemable value and is trustless (i.e., can be used for transactions between enemies), (2) paper money built on credit tied to hard money and (3) fiat money issued at will by sovereigns. Another way to describe the same concept is to say that money starts out physically scarce, then becomes digitally or contractually scarce and then loses its scarcity entirely.      The entropy of the system, or alternately human nature, moves us from scarce money to credit because we want growth. I believe this is tied to how our brains are wired for loss aversion and dopamine rewards. We will cheat ourselves from the future for just a hit of pleasure today. Credit is its own animal, and left unchecked unhinges from collateral to become mere imagination. Once that imagination runs wild and is spent for the enrichment of the few (e.g., corporate equity buybacks) rather than the safety of the money (e.g., universal health care), you get some form of revolution or currency devaluation, which then leads to seeking scarcity again. Here's how Dalio illustrates it:      If you're not going berserk looking at the above chart, which shows a peak of the monetary base as a percentage of GDP in the 1930s and then in 2010-2020, then you are not paying attention. The U.S. is massively unmoored from scarcity by design, which puts us on the brink of a systemic paradigm shift. Last month, the government printed 20% of GDP in a single stroke, and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. The gold and bitcoin bugs feel vindicated in their core philosophical premise, which is that the central banks will always ""cheat"" and generate more money whenever politically convenient. That has been reflected in the price of gold, if you control for the effects of foreign actors rushing to the dollar as a reserve currency.      If we go back to Dalio's description of the money super-cycle machine, our economy is in 1930s territory, as is the divided state of our polity and the rising autocratic pressure across the world given wealth and income inequality. But let's table the latter and focus on the former. President Franklin Roosevelt and the Keynesians drove the largest expansion of the American social welfare system and government employment in response to the Great Depression. The government gave itself new fiscal powers and silenced the judiciary (at the time, a good thing) to spend, spend, spend to avoid unbearable crises.      Two growing ideas are used to justify the current approach of the central banks. One is called Modern Monetary Theory (""MMT""), which goes one step further than the Keynesians, who thought taxation and bond issuance should be the mechanism by which money is tied to government obligations before it is spent by the government. MMT supporters think money, especially when it is the reserve currency and is thereby protected from foreign exchange pressure, is phantom accounting and simply should be issued by the government to provide social services like universal basic income and health care. The policy target is full employment.      See also: Software Ate the World, Here’s How It Eats Finance      While I am likely distorting the summary with personal bias, to me it seems the core goal here is for the government to use money for maintaining the standard of living inside a late-stage reserve-incumbent empire. Dalio's take is here, wherein he titles MMT as ""Monetary Policy 3"" or MP3.      The second idea is called Market Monetarism, advocated by economist Scott Sumner, my friend David Siegel and Eliezer Yudkowsky. If you have an hour to spare and want an eerily prescient imagined conversation between Yudkowsky and a central banker, read this piece from 2017 that predicts the future we live in. The core premise is that central banks should not target interest rates or unemployment, but instead choose a long-term nominal GDP growth target like 5%. If you have real GDP growth of 2%, you need inflation of 3%. If you have real GDP growth of -10%, you need inflation of 15%. Further, the effects of this should persist year over year such that mistakes are corrected to the multi-year average (e.g., if you want to grow 50% over 10 years, you would need to go up 6% if you only did 4% last year, ignoring the actual compounding arithmetic).    Our economy is in 1930s territory, as is the divided state of our polity, and the rising autocratic pressure across the world given wealth and income inequality.    The outcome is that economic actors in this NGDP targeted system can rely on what economic growth looks like, at least on paper. To effect this in practice, the money machine has to print variable rates of inflation or disinflation. Printing 20% of GDP or having negative interest rates is just fine, as long as it leads to that 5% growth expectation coming true. Everything else is just a math plug, since fiat money is just a construct in a database.      The year 2020 will see the above logic tested precisely. Whether it works or not in the long term will be experimentally observed. But I have strong doubts, and think Ray Dalio's piece provides the necessary bridges between Market Monetarism and Modern Monetary Theory to the long history of humankind.      We can play the confidence game in the late stages of American empire, sure. We can unmoor money from the economy and stimulate employment in order to dampen social unrest, preventing societal collapse and another Constitutional crisis. But there's a cycle, and it is a cycle of trust.      Physical scarcity and utility is one aspect. You can trust the shiny gold you hold now, and the shiny gold in the shelf of the museum. There are thousands of years of precedent saying it is safe to own.      Digital scarcity and utility is another aspect. Blockchain-based systems have recreated such attributes in Bitcoin, Ethereum and others. While many people are wary of these systems today, it is largely due to the tragedy of scammers and hackers undermining the public perception of sound long-term technology for short term gains. Digital assets traveling on decentralized rails are one of the few alternatives to sovereign currencies and physical bullion. They will benefit not just from the collapse of the business cycle, but the broader ending of the macro super-cycle.      Through this lens, China's quick movement to the blockchain-based yuan is a story of battle for global hegemony. It needs to park its reserve currency into the crypto ecosystem. That will compete with over $10 billion of U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoins already in use. What we can also deduce by corollary is that once money truly flows into blockchain-anchored economies, blockchain-native software and businesses will bloom by the thousands.

42404635,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdjXkn,1589808820,"Winners and Losers in the US' $1,200 Check Blitz","J.P. Koning, a CoinDesk columnist, worked as an equity researcher at a Canadian brokerage firm and a financial writer at a large Canadian bank. He runs the popular Moneyness blog.      Head over to “r/stimuluscheck”, a subreddit on Reddit, and you'll learn some sad facts about the U.S. government's ability to make emergency payments to Americans.      Created in March to share information about coronavirus relief payments, r/stimulus now has over 20,000 members and garners thousands of comments per day. It is full of stories about Americans grappling with misdirected payments and poorly communicated procedures. Many have lost hope of ever getting relief. When they finally get paid, recipients celebrate by posting a screenshot of their notification.      See also: How the COVID-19 Crisis Revived the Digital Dollar Debate      The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act, entitles around 80% of Americans to a one-time cash rebate of up to $1,200. That means that 200 million or so of America's 250 million adults will get some form of relief. The House Committee on Ways and Means estimates 171 million payments will eventually be made (couples may receive one joint payment).      The nature of this crisis means speed is vital. Around 33 million Americans have lost their jobs. Many more are making less income than before. But they still have to pay bills and buy food. That’s what the $1,200 per American is for.      Unfortunately, the timing of the stimulus isn't equally distributed. Some Americans have already received their $1,200. Millions are still waiting.      What determines whether one gets their stimulus now or later? Two themes help explain variations in speed: wealth and age.    The poor and the old should not be penalized.    Wealthier Americans tend to file their taxes while poorer ones don't. Filers have been first in line while many non-filers are still waiting for their $1,200.      As for age, younger people are more comfortable than older ones with direct deposit. Direct deposit, an electronic transfer of funds into a bank account or onto a prepaid debit card, is much faster than paper check. And so the young have received their funds before older Americans.      The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is the department responsible for making the $1,200 payments. On April 10, two weeks after the CARES Act was signed into law, it began to disburse funds. Taxpayers were the first on the IRS’ list. Around 92 million Americans who filed taxes in the last two years have already provided the IRS with their direct deposit information. They did so to get a tax refund. These tax filers would automatically get their $1,200 stimulus via direct deposit – no need to provide the IRS with any additional information.      The first wave of direct deposits the IRS sent out on Friday, April 10, went to 80 million Americans, almost all of them from this group of filers. Even among this lucky initial wave there were winners and losers. Though the IRS hit the ""pay"" button on the 10th, most tax filers had to wait for five days – till Wednesday, April 15 – for their bank to credit funds to their accounts. Only then could they spend their $1,200 in relief.      See also: ‘Digital Dollar’ Reintroduced by US Lawmakers in Latest Stimulus Bill      But not filers who use upstart online-only banks or prepaid debit cards such as Chime, N26, Netspend, American Express BlueBird and Varo. They got their $1,200 as early as April 10, long before filers at the major banks like Citibank and Wells Fargo. And they weren’t afraid to gloat about it on r/stimulucheck.      How so? U.S. automated clearinghouses take several days to clear and settle payments. Online-only banks and prepaid card issuers often front money to their customers in anticipation of a government check or salary payment.      In general, young people tend to use digital banks, so they were the ones who benefited from these stimulus advances. Older people who bank at traditional institutions had to wait till Wednesday for their $1,200. This same pattern occurred on the IRS' next payday. The IRS submitted another eight million or so payments on Friday, April 17. Most didn't get their $1,200 until April 22, but many online-only customers got theirs on the 17th.      What about non-filers, who tend to be in the lowest income brackets?      Unfortunately, they have been eating the dust of filers who use direct deposit.      People who earn less than $12,200 don't need to file taxes. Which means the IRS doesn't have their payments information on hand. But people with low incomes are those most sensitive to payments delays.      Studies have found that around 10% of Americans are non-filers. This works out to around 25 million adults. To reach out to these missing millions, the IRS announced a non-filers website on April 10. This tool allowed non-filers to provide a bank account or address so that the IRS could send them their $1,200.      But this introduced frictions into the user experience. Whereas filers had their $1,200 deposited automatically, non-filers had to know about the tool, use it properly and have internet access.      Within the non-filer group are those who receive government support. The IRS told non-filers on Social Security they didn't need to use the non-filers tool. They would receive their $1,200 automatically.    Whereas [tax] filers had their $1,200 deposited automatically, non-filers had to know about the tool, use it properly, and have internet access.    Included in this category are many of the 61 million Americans who receive benefits from the Social Security Administration (SSA). Think those on retirement, disability and survivor benefits. The SSA also supports eitht million of America's most disadvantaged by providing them with supplemental security income (SSI).      Veterans receiving disability compensation and pension benefits from Veteran Affairs (VA) were told to not bother with the non-filers tool. Around two million veterans on benefits do not file taxes.      By teaming up with the SSA and VA, the IRS planned to use the individual payments information the SSA and VA had on file to quickly get $1,200 to millions of benefit recipients who didn't file taxes.      The process of paying out government benefits is already highly digitized. In 2013, Social Security recipients were required to switch from check to electronic payment. By 2019, around 99% of benefit recipients received a direct deposit. Those without accounts have been issued a special government prepaid card, the Direct Express card, so they can still receive direct deposits.      So given that the IRS had many non-filers’ electronic payments information, you'd think that it could make these payments go quite fast.      Not so. Social Security disability recipients did not start to get their $1,200 stimulus until April 29, 19 days after the first filers began to get them. As of May 8 many of those on SSI and Veterans still haven't received a direct deposit.      Over at r/stimuluscheck, one exasperated SSI recipient just received notification of impending payment: ""My SSI recipients please don't give up hope!! I checked my status a few minutes ago and found my deposit date."" She is scheduled to get funds on May 13, more than a month after filers who use digital banks began to receive their $1,200.      It's a mystery why the IRS waited till the end of April and beginning of May to start paying those on Social Security. After all, it already had electronic payments information for beneficiaries.      The last large group of losers are those who receive paper checks.      Around 18 million Americans who filed taxes in 2019 preferred to get their refund in check form. Another 45 million Americans who filed taxes either owed taxes or had a nil balance. Since they didn’t get a refund, the IRS does not have their direct deposit information on file. So unless they quickly notified the IRS of their account information by visiting the ""Get My Payment"" tool, their $1,200 will default to check form.      Millions of Americans who are unbanked will also be receiving checks.      The check is a very old form of payment. The Bank of England Museum has one going back to 1660 on which Nicholas Vanacker instructs his banker to pay £200 to Mr. Delboe. Resilient it may be, but a check isn't fast. It takes time to print up, personalize, and send.      The IRS started to mail out checks on April 20, 10 days after the first direct deposit. It originally estimated it would be sending out just over 100 million checks by mail. Unfortunately, it can only process around five million checks per week, which means that it could take up to 20 weeks to mail them all out. That pushes the completion date to early September. Luckily for those with low incomes, the IRS says it will send them out in ascending order from poorest to richest.      Check usage is correlated with age; the older you are, the more likely you are to prefer check. So older Americans will be waiting the longest for their stimulus.      So where are we now? To date, the IRS says it has made 130 million payments. That's still far short of the 171 million that it originally expected.      The IRS effort was probably the best anyone could do given the circumstances. But the next time an emergency hits the U.S., hopefully the government will have improved the timing of relief payments. The poor and the old should not be penalized. And maybe the public will have learned from this episode, too. It's time to stop relying on glacially slow checks and give direct deposit a try.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION,JP Koning,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/05/18/winners-and-losers-in-the-us-1200-check-blitz,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/702171d48f1f4564e03e5b840a2ebda8d1ecb7c9-1780x1187.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The famous venture capital fund, which has a substantial crypto portfolio, said in a post Friday it anticipated some of the better projects created in the wake of the 2017 initial coin offering (ICO) boom to contribute to a new industry boom period.      Pulling from ""anecdotal"" evidence and data going back 10 years, a16z says ""price innovation cycles"" – including those that peaked in 2011, 2013 and 2017 – begin with price increases that attract new people with bright ideas who end up creating promising companies and projects that benefit the space overall.      ""A key feature of crypto cycles is that each one plants seeds which later grow and drive the next cycle,"" reads the blog post. These new projects ultimately ""inspire more people, eventually culminating in the next cycle."" Ethereum was created in the 2013 cycle, for example, and that became the foundation for the ICOs that drove the next cycle in 2017.      The VC fund forecasts: ""The 2017 cycle spawned dozens of exciting projects in a wide range of areas including payments, finance, games, infrastructure, and web apps. Many of these projects are launching in the near future, possibly driving a fourth crypto cycle.""      See also: NEAR Protocol Launches Following $21M Token Sale Led by Andreessen Horowitz      The blog post comes just under three weeks after the VC firm said its new Crypto Fund II exceeded the initial $450 million fundraising target and would launch with a total of $515 million to invest in the space.      Unlike the first fund, which launched in 2018 with a more general investment prospectus, a16z said the new fund would target specific sectors within the industry, including decentralized finance (DeFi), next-generation payments and Web 3 (the concept of a decentralized internet).      A blog post at the time, written by a16z general partner Chris Dixon, also co-author of the latest post, said: ""In just a decade of existence, crypto has gone through several waves. With each new wave, the applications of crypto extend to a greater number of categories and more visionary entrepreneurs enter the space.""      See also: Crypto M&A and Fundraising Dropped Sharply in 2019: PwC Report      A16z doesn't predict when this fourth cycle might hit crypto. But many of the projects it suggests could play a pivotal role in the next iteration of the industry are also, perhaps unsurprisingly, ones it has invested in.      These include derivatives exchange dYdX, cloud computing platform Dfinity, stablecoin provider Maker, and ""privacy-first"" cloud platform Oasis Labs – all four of which are in a16z's active portfolio.      In fact, 10 of the 18 projects a16z underlines as potentially pivotal in the industry's fourth cycle have received investments from the VC fund.",POSITIVE,NEAR,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TRADING | NEAR | TOKEN SALE,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/05/18/andreessen-horowitz-forecasts-fourth-crypto-bull-cycle,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bdea1e9a6eea9666925c81c3c0ebce5153ab341a-1200x792.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

As high-profile investors including Stanley Druckenmiller and David Tepper were warning of looming bankruptcies, overvalued stocks and the increasingly distant chances of a rapid economic recovery, bitcoiners celebrated the cryptocurrency's third halving and held spirited discussions on the future of money during a virtual New York Blockchain Week.      You're reading First Mover, CoinDesk's daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      Bitcoin trading volumes are averaging their highest levels since last July, according to Arcane Research, while the number of open bitcoin futures contracts on the CME exchange is rocketing and big hedge-fund managers like Paul Tudor Jones are reportedly nosing into the market.      Such enthusiasm contrasts markedly with the dour outlook of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who noted last week in a televised interview that the decline in economic activity and U.S. employment was so ""severe"" that the total increase in jobs over the past decade has now been wiped out.      For bitcoiners, the pessimism on the economy was just another reason to be bullish, since it means the Federal Reserve is likely to inject more money into the markets, strengthening the case for buying the cryptocurrency as an inflation hedge. The Fed's total assets, which stood at $4.2 trillion at the start of the year, have now surged to almost $7 trillion.      Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, is up a staggering 38% year-to-date, compared with an 11% decline for the S&P. On Sunday bitcoin rose for the sixth day in seven to $9,891, just shy of the psychological threshold of $10,000.      ""Bitcoin has been performing well, while the stock market has struggled,"" Arcane Research, a cryptocurrency analysis firm, wrote Friday in a report. ""If this trend continues, it could also be strengthened by people finally believing the narrative and then becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy.""      Many traditional investors discount cryptocurrencies, but at the moment capital markets, at least in theory, are signaling the blockchain and digital asset industries are deserving of more investment.      Bank stocks got hit hard last week as investors fretted over the prospect of shrinking lending margins and swelling loan losses. The Fed, which oversees the biggest U.S. banks, relaxed a key regulatory ratio that could make it easier for the financial institutions to buy more Treasury bonds, which the government is selling in bundles to help finance the fast-expanding $25 trillion national debt.      In a report late Friday, the Fed warned that ""asset prices remain vulnerable to significant declines,"" with trouble spots appearing in commercial real estate, corporate bonds, leveraged loans and collateralized loan obligations.      A Commerce Department report last week showed U.S. retail sales plunged 16% in April, a record, and the 118-year-old department-store owner J.C. Penney filed for bankruptcy protection. Some 36 million U.S. workers have filed unemployment claims in the past eight weeks, according to CNBC.      ""Another week, and more records shattered, and not the good kind,"" Scott Anderson, chief economist for Bank of the West, a unit of France's BNP Paribas, wrote Friday in a report.      Even the White House's top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, told Fox Business Network the economy was ""still in freefall."" President Donald Trump tweeted that the Fed should cut benchmark interest rates to negative levels for the first time in history.      Indeed, some of the few glimpses of optimism to emerge last week came when Wall Street captains were speaking about digital money.      Visa CEO Al Kelly, appearing at the giant U.S. bank JPMorgan's annual tech conference, said digital currencies could be ""additive to the payments ecosystem as opposed to being any kind of replacement or negative."" Citigroup CEO Mike Corbat said that more banking activities are suddenly going digital, including putting letters of credit on blockchains.      Former Citigroup CEO Vikram Pandit, who led the big U.S. bank through its $45 billion bailout during the 2008-2009 financial crisis, lamented in the New York Times' Dealbook blog that sending coronavirus-relief payments via digital wallets was a ""great idea that could not be executed because we lack the necessary plumbing.""      Brian Brooks, chief operating officer of the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, another bank regulator, told CoinDesk's Consensus: Distributed virtual conference on May 11 that it might make sense to allow crypto companies to be licensed as financial institutions on a national, rather than state-by-state level.      The very next day, The Wall Street Journal reported JPMorgan had taken on the big cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase and Gemini as customers.      Kraken, another big cryptocurrency exchange, tweeted on May 14 it had hired 100 people in the past three weeks.      During a panel discussion last week hosted by the digital-asset exchange Huobi as part of CoinDesk's virtual conference, investor Kyle Samani of Multicoin Capital said there's a 5-10% chance that the combined market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies surges above $1 trillion later this year, from about $270 billion currently.      Blockchain.com noted in a monthly outlook on May 8 that bitcoin's halving provided an opportunity to mark how much the digital-asset industry had grown over the past four years. The halving disappointed some investors with its anemic price action, but bitcoin rallied in the days afterward.      ""In 2020 we have a much broader array of market participants, larger market players, more established exchanges, and a far more developed derivatives market,"" according to the report.      The analysts added: ""Amidst this environment, more and more evidence indicates that institutional and retail investors are looking to both gold and bitcoin as an alternative to buying stocks at present valuations.""      Whether a self-fulfilling prophecy or just capitalism at work, it's the signal that markets currently are sending.    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    BTC: Price: $9,642 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $9,933 | 24-Hr Low: $9,497      Trend: Bitcoin's struggle for a convincing move above $10,000 continues despite a major breakout on technical charts.      The cryptocurrency is currently trading near $9,620, having faced rejection near $9,970 earlier on Monday, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index. Upward momentum has run out of steam near $10,000 three times in the last four days.      The latest retreat from near $10,000 comes on the heels of a bullish weekly close (Sunday, 00:00 UTC). Bitcoin jumped 10% last week and ended above the resistance of the trendline connecting the June 2019 and February 2020 highs.      The breakout is also backed by an above-50 or bullish reading on the 14-week relative strength index and higher bars on the MACD histogram, a sign of strengthening upward momentum.      So far, however, a move into five figures has remained elusive. The weekly chart breakout would lose its shine if prices drop below $9,589, invalidating the bullish higher-lows setup on the hourly chart. That would open the doors for a fall back to $9,000. The former resistance-turned-support of the descending trendline is now located at $9,070.      Buy volumes (green bars) consistently remained low as prices rose from $8,200 to $9,900 in the five days to May 14. A low -volume price rise is often short-lived. Hence, a possibility of a drop below support at $9,589 cannot be ruled out.      On the higher side, a move above the high of $10,070 seen in the first week of May is needed to restore the bullish trend, as noted on Friday.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,"Bradley Keoun, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/18/first-mover-bitcoins-2020-rally-sends-message-to-capitalists-as-despair-on-wall-street-grows,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/33f2b0f05b2cdd6245aac8f7c1978649775ad773-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404638,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdjXoj,1589798250,Bitcoin Battles for $10K as Gold Prints Over 7-Year High,"Bitcoin's attempt to scale the psychological resistance of $10,000 looks to have stalled again, even as gold soars to new highs.      The top cryptocurrency by market value is currently trading around $9,630 at time of writing, representing an over 145% gain on the low of $3,867 registered March 12, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.      However, the cryptocurrency faced rejection near $10,000 early Monday – its third failure to cross info five figures since May 1 – and printed a low of $9,450 during European trading hours. The drop put prices down over 0.5% on the day.      Meanwhile, gold, a safe haven asset, is currently trading 1.16% up on the day at $1,760 per ounce – the highest level since October 2012. The precious metal has risen by 4% since May 12 and is up 21% from the lows registered in March.      “Bitcoin has not been able to stay above the significant US$10,000 level [but] it has made considerable gains through the year. Gold has seen more than a 15% increase since 1st January 2020, but we have to remember that BTC has also increased by 33% through the same period, “ said Marcus Swanepoel, CEO at cryptocurrency platform Luno.      See also: First Mover: Bitcoin’s 2020 Rally Sends Message to Capitalists as Despair on Wall Street Grows      Essentially, Swanepoel is suggesting bitcoin may be facing temporary bull exhaustion, as buyer fatigue is common following strong price rallies like the one seen in bitcoin over the past two months.      Gold, too, faced buyer exhaustion following a quick rally from $1,450 to $1,747 in the four weeks to mid-April. The safe-haven metal consolidated in a narrowing price range for nearly a month before breaking higher on May 14.    Pullbacks may be short-lived    As such, bitcoin may continue to under perform compared with gold in the short term. The cryptocurrency may also suffer a drop similar to the one seen following bitcoin’s second halving on July 9, 2016. Bitcoin underwent its third halving last Monday.      However, the post-halving pullback seen in 2016 was short-lived and the cryptocurrency went on to hit new record highs within one year from halving. ""The dramatic increase in bitcoin value following the 2nd halving was not immediate, and we still feel that the potential 3rd halving increase is likely to come through,"" said Swanepoel.      Additionally, other macro factors which supposedly pushed bitcoin higher over the last two months, are still valid.      The U.S. Federal Reserve continues to expand its balance sheet via unprecedented inflation-boosting open-ended asset purchases and stands ready to do more in the near future.      See also: Crypto Long & Short: Mining Derivatives Point to Growing Sophistication      ""I will say that we’re not out of ammunition by a long shot. No, there’s really no limit to what we can do with these lending programs that we have. So there’s a lot more we can do to support the economy, and we’re committed to doing everything we can as long as we need to,"" Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told CBS’ “60 Minutes"" on Sunday.      Further, the U.S.-China tensions over the coronavirus outbreak are leading to a renewed trade spat and major economies are still struggling to decide whether to reopen economies in spite of the coronavirus dangers or risk a more prolonged slowdown with continued lockdowns.    Demand ahead?    With all this in mind, investors have a strong incentive to look for alternative safe havens apart from traditional assets like gold, U.S. treasuries and Japanese yen. Increasingly, investors appear to consider bitcoin a safe haven asset and a hedge against inflation. That's because the cryptocurrency’s supply is limited to 21 million and the pace of issuance is cut by half every four years at the halving events.      And new investors are indeed entering the crypto space, according to B2C2, one of the largest over-the-counter (OTC) market makers. “We are seeing explosive growth in OTC volumes this year with new counterparties coming online each month. Geographically there's been a large pick-up in hedge fund activities from the Americas while we've seen a pick-up in European high-net-worth demand,” Phillip Gillespie, CEO of B2C2 Japan, told CoinDesk.      ""Our sharpest directional clients are all quite long and seem to be positioning for a break higher,” Gillespie added, drawing attention to the bitcoin-gold ratio, which may provide a hint of increased investor interest in alternative inflation hedges like bitcoin.      The ratio currently stands at 5.44, while the resistance of the trendline linking the December 2017 and June 2019 highs is located at 6.40.      A move above that hurdle could mark the beginning of a larger shift in investor attitudes toward the cryptocurrency.

42404637,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdjXml,1589796000,"Accel, Coinbase Join $17M Funding Rounds for Institutional Crypto Trading Firm FalconX","FalconX's multi-million-dollar cumulative pre-seed and seed funding from an impressive list of investors reflects institutional demand for a platform that aims to fight artificially inflated trading volumes in the crypto space.      The cryptocurrency trading platform announced Wednesday it had raised a total of $17 million in a round led by Accel – which has Facebook and Slack in its portfolio – and with the likes of Coinbase Ventures, Fenbushi Capital and Avon Ventures also investing.      That's a lot for a pre-seed and seed round. To give some perspective, Facebook – the social media giant now worth over $600 billion – raised $12.7 million, in a round also led by Accel, in a Series A funding round in 2005. Of course, inflation means Facebook's raise would now be worth the same as FalconX's; then again, a pre-seed and seed come before a Series A.      So what made FalconX such a draw for investors? Put simply, it provides best trade execution. An AI platform plugs into a network of exchanges and dark pools, providing the best available prices and minimal slippage. The idea, explains the firm's website, is to provide the base trading layer that mainstream financial institutions need to delve into the digital asset class.      See also: Crypto Data Provider Skew Raises $5M, Launches Trade Execution Platform      In an email, a FalconX spokesperson told CoinDesk the platform provides a solution to wash trading, where exchanges or crypto projects trade against themselves to inflate volumes, drive up prices and dump assets on unsuspecting investors.      It's a known problem in crypto: a report from Bitwise in early 2019 claimed as much as 95% of all exchange volume was fake.      Wash trading is ""a pain-point with our institutional clientele,"" a FalconX spokesperson said, and systemic data misreporting precludes mainstream institutions from touching the space. Filtering out ""bad market data"" had allowed the platform to scale to $7 billion in volume ""while still in stealth mode and no spend on marketing,"" the spokesperson said.      So when it came to the seed round, a pitch of fighting against bad market data ""resonated very well with our investors,"" the spokesperson explained. ""They went into great detail on how we leverage data science to identify ‘wash volume’ in eliminating slippage, derive time guarantee from dynamic exchange order books, defend against security threats, and improve infrastructure reliability.""      FalconX claims to have around 100 clients: hedge funds, proprietary firms and over-the-counter (OTC) desks as well as some mining firms and crypto exchanges. A further appeal to investors. The spokesperson couldn't help but mention their team, which included ex-employees from Google, Goldman Sachs, Pantera Capital, Kraken, and PayPal, which may also have helped.      See also: CZ’s Twitter Feed Swayed New CoinMarketCap Ranking That Put Binance on Top      So what will FalconX spend its $17 million on? Per a press release, funding will go to new products and an expanded trade execution suite, as well as changes to the trading infrastructure aimed to help the company scale. Having only launched 10 months ago, FalconX claims to have a quarterly growth rate of 6,000%.      In TechCrunch's appraisal of the raise, company founders Raghu Yarlagadda and Prabhakar Reddy said potential clients are required to have around $10 million in assets under management (AUM). That requirement isn't likely to change as FalconX says it has no plans to broaden its client base; retail investors won't be able to use the platform.      CoinDesk asked whether FalconX is creating two-tiered market access and perpetuating an unfair trading environment.      A spokesperson said some of the firms clients use FalconX's technology to improve the trading experience for their own retail clients. But they added: ""the market remains drastically underserved,"" perhaps hinting that there's nothing to stop other platforms providing best trade executions for retail investors, should they want to,",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | SPONSORED | TRADING,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/18/accel-coinbase-join-17m-funding-rounds-for-institutional-crypto-trading-firm-falconx,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7189103a46fb8211403080a991df77488a9df790-1500x1039.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404643,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdjXte,1589792400,Crypto Long & Short: Mining Derivatives Point to Growing Sophistication,"Well, it happened. Block 630,000 was processed on the Bitcoin blockchain (while we were on the air with our Crypto Long & Short show on Monday, how cool is that!), and the bitcoin subsidy paid to miners was cut from 12.5 bitcoins to 6.25. It felt momentous, as we all witnessed a pre-programmed economic system immutably do its thing. (Allen Farrington’s essay beautifully describes what it meant to those of us watching.)      Many of you are probably breathing a sigh of relief now that you don’t have to hear about the halving again for a few years. Understandable – it has dominated the crypto conversation over the past few months. But one feature will not disappear: the focus on bitcoin mining. This conversation is worth continuing because it births new business models and new financial products that in turn open up new investment opportunities and risks.      You're reading Crypto Long & Short, a newsletter that looks closely at the forces driving cryptocurrency markets. Authored by CoinDesk's head of research, Noelle Acheson, it goes out every Sunday and offers a recap of the week – with insights and analysis – from a professional investor's point of view. You can subscribe here.      Last week I wrote about how bitcoin mining was “growing up,” becoming more structured, scaled and financialized. The trend is continuing in leaps and bounds.      This week, derivatives exchange FTX launched what they are calling “hashrate futures.” Technically, they are not hashrate futures, they are difficulty futures. What’s the difference? Hashrate represents the computational power at work processing bitcoin transaction blocks. Since we don’t know at any given time how many miners are active and with which machines, the figure is an estimation derived from the difficulty level and the time between blocks.      The difficulty level refers to the requirements for successfully processing a transaction block. Miners have to find a random number that, when added to the block and run through the hash algorithm, produces a string with a certain number of zeroes at the beginning. The more zeroes, the harder the challenge. If blocks are being successfully processed too quickly, the difficulty rate adjusts upward, and the opposite if blocks are taking too long.      Both variables affect the amount of electricity a miner will have to consume. Being able to hedge either will remove some of the uncertainty around the mining business model, much like an airline hedges its fuel cost. Admittedly, airline revenues aren’t as volatile as bitcoin miner revenues, but the market is not short of instruments that let miners hedge their income. Hedging mining costs, on the other hand, is a relatively new concept that could, when more extended, have a fundamental impact on the sector’s profitability and resilience. Less uncertainty around costs could encourage more investment in bitcoin mining, which in turn could bring more security to the network.      This particular instrument may or may not take off. Its significance is more that it could trigger a new wave of financial innovation that supports the growth and increasing sophistication of the bitcoin mining industry, which is struggling to adjust to reduced revenue and tougher competition. All this, just as the world is paying more attention to its output.    Trust in crypto tells a tale    Earlier this week, PR firm Edelman published a special edition of its famed Trust Barometer report, focused on cryptocurrency.  While the sample size is relatively large for a survey (+34,000 people over 18 years old, across 28 countries), it is still limited and so these findings are no more than an unverifiable indication of global sentiment. They are, however, revealing, and have some intriguing messages hidden between the lines.  First, some background: Edelman started these surveys in 2001, to gauge the public’s most pressing concerns and its level of comfort with established institutions. Its 2020 annual survey, published in January, before the COVID-19 crisis reached its peak, revealed a world already stressed about the role of technology in the economy. According to the results, over two-thirds of the population feel the pace of change is too fast. Over 80% are worried they will lose their job to automation. And more than half believe capitalism causes more harm than good. The survey is worth checking out, if only for a reminder that the current crisis we are living through is not just because of the pandemic.  Now, on to some of the data points from the cryptocurrency edition:    Almost 50% of the multi-market survey sample trust cryptocurrencies, up 11 points from last year and only 10 points less than the percentage of those that trust banks. That sounds encouraging, until you notice that only 34% of U.S. respondents answered in the affirmative, down slightly on 2019. Over 80% of Chinese respondents, however, trust crypto, up 10 points on 2019. Western media often treats the U.S. as cryptocurrency’s largest potential market – this shows that perhaps we’re wrong.  Other countries with a strong jump in the trust factor are Argentina (+25 points!), Mexico, Colombia and Brazil. These are, perhaps not coincidentally, the countries whose currencies have most depreciated against the dollar over the past 12 months.  One outlier is South Africa, whose currency has depreciated by 30%, while its apparent trust of crypto has jumped only nine points to reach a relatively lackluster 49%. This may be a geography to watch, especially since, as Delphi Digital pointed out in its latest State of Bitcoin report, the price of bitcoin denominated in South African rand has increased a whopping 60% so far this year.  Moving on, only 35% of respondents believe cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology will have a net positive impact. In the U.S., this figure is an unenthusiastic 26%. Look at the figure for China, though: a substantial 62%. Yes, proportionally, China has more than double the conviction of the U.S. in blockchain’s potential. Combine this with the strong push from all levels of government for blockchain application research, and the imminent launch of the Chinese digital currency, and you get even more of a sense of a blockchain powerhouse emerging.  Finally, the report reveals a strong push for more centralized control over crypto markets. More than 60% of respondents believe that cryptocurrency needs more regulation. Unsurprisingly, the call for regulation is greater in those countries with low trust levels (Italy, Spain, Hong Kong), but even in areas with high trust levels, over 50% of respondents think that the sector is not regulated enough.  This hints at widespread mainstream support for licensing and FATF rules. As regulations are rolled out, we could see mainstream comfort and adoption levels grow.    All in all, this report indicates a notable increase in global understanding and support of crypto currencies. Of the 28 markets surveyed, only three had lower trust in cryptoassets than last year, and the declines were negligible. One of these was the U.S., however, which will be a narrative to watch.  As currency turmoil starts to crowd out other worrying headlines, as fractures in traditional institutions continue to emerge, and as the never-ending crypto education process continues, trust in crypto assets and blockchain technology is likely to continue to spread across emerging markets. This in turn will impact the value proposition and trust from investors and builders in more developed economies.  And, there’s bitcoin’s resilience. As hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones II said on CNBC earlier this week: “Every day that goes by and bitcoin survives, the trust in it will go up.”    Anyone know what's going on yet?    In spite of the hype around the halving and the crypto-laden virtual air around our massive Consensus: Distributed event, bitcoin had a lackluster week, falling 1%. Gold and long-term bonds did better, edging slightly up on persistent concerns about inflation, deflation or perhaps both.      It’s interesting to note that the more tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has consistently outperformed its much larger sibling, and is almost flat on the year, while the S&P 500 is down more than 11%. Bitcoin is up over 35%, outperforming even gold.      The economic hits keep on coming: The U.K. and Germany, Europe's two largest economies, are now officially in recession, and Brexit has reared its contentious head again. The pound joined a host of other currencies in their continued depreciation against the dollar. The question on many analysts' worry lists is how long this currency tension can continue before something snaps.      (Note: Nothing in this newsletter is investment advice. The author owns small amounts of bitcoin and ether.)    Chain links    Well-known hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones II has confirmed he has invested somewhere between 1% and 2% of his assets in bitcoin. TAKEWAY: This detail comes on top of the revelation last week that his fund was looking at investing in bitcoin futures on the CME, and underlines his conviction which appears to go beyond that of short-term trading gains. Tudor Jones’ comments show that he is not a bitcoin bull – he recognizes that it is a nascent type of asset, and may not succeed – but he’s evaluated the risk profile and believe there is greater upside than downside, especially given the current macroeconomic environment.      Crytpo research team Delphi Digital published a comprehensive report on bitcoin, covering network metrics, market performance, software upgrades and underlying narratives. TAKEAWAY: There’s a lot to unpack here, and something for everyone, but I found sections on wallet balances and on emerging markets particularly interesting. So far this year, the number of small holders (less than 1 BTC) has gone up over 6%, which indicates a growth in retail interest. The number of large holders (more than 10,000 BTC) has declined by 2%, which indicates either profit taking, or traders exiting, spooked by the volatility.      Coin Metrics analyzed the timestamp of stablecoin transfers to glean more information as to their use. It turns out that most tether, USDC and PAX transactions occur during Asian and European hours. DAI transfers, on the other hand, are concentrated in U.S. hours. TAKEAWAY: Interesting that programmatic stablecoins such as DAI are less appealing to Asian and European investors than those in the U.S. Another takeaway is that tether and USDC usage is more concentrated than PAX, which implies a higher degree of institutional use.      The Wall Street Journal reported JPMorgan is now offering banking services to crypto exchanges Coinbase and Gemini. TAKEAWAY: This strong sign of increasing legitimacy of crypto businesses in the eyes of legacy finance, and should assuage investors’ concerns as to the reliability of crypto market infrastructure.      PwC released its annual Crypto Funds report, compiled in collaboration with fund manager Elwood, which revealed some interesting trends:      - A quantitative strategy is the most common by far, accounting for almost 50% of the crypto fund universe (which, for purposes of this report, does not include crypto index or venture capital funds). - Almost 90% of crypto fund investors are either family offices or high-net worth individuals. - The total AUM more than doubled over 2019, in spite of the bear market. - The percentage of funds with more than $20 million AUM doubled over 2019. - Bitcoin-only funds easily outperformed all other types in 2019. - Approximately 40% of crypto funds are also involved in staking, lending or both, which indicates a deepening familiarity with sector developments. - 56% actively use derivatives. - Over 80% use an independent custodian, vs just over 50% in 2018. - Over 40% are domiciled in the Cayman Islands, which, as well as a favorable tax regime, also gives them a wide range of exchanges from which to choose.      As further evidence that bitcoin-only funds have been outperforming, performance figures for Pantera Capital – one of the oldest and largest crypto fund managers in the sector – show that its flagship bitcoin fund lost 75.6% in 2018 and gained 87.7% in 2019, according to internal materials seen by CoinDesk. This brings the fund’s historical returns to 10,162%. TAKEAWAY: The relative outperformance of bitcoin funds could be interpreted as a sign that the sector is still young – new institutional money is likely to gravitate towards the oldest and largest cryptocurrency, for its liquidity and robustness. However, as the sector matures, more diversified funds are likely to rise in prominence, especially as bitcoin so far this year is underperforming equally weighted indices representing a broader range of tokens.      From the PwC/Elwood report mentioned above, we can infer a growing institutional interest in staking, in which investors earn rewards for locking up their holdings in order to participate in network governance. This past week, the Proof of Stake Alliance published a series of standards around marketing language, designed after conversations with regulators. TAKEAWAY: In last year’s PwC report, staking was barely mentioned. This year the report specifies that almost 40% of crypto funds are involved in crypto lending, staking or both. This points to growing sophistication amongst funds and investors. Staking is still a marginal crypto investment opportunity, but is likely to continue to grow as proof of stake networks evolve and as ethereum edges towards its protocol shift.      A blog post from crypto exchange Coinbase points out that bitcoin’s dominance wanes in bull markets. TAKEAWAY: The post’s author hypothesizes that this could be because investors become confident enough on their bitcoin bets to other possible category winners. It could also be because a bear market sees a flight to “relative” safety, away from smaller tokens and toward the more established bitcoin. Retail investors, however, show a propensity to trade other tokens in times of volatility, at higher levels than their market caps would suggest. 75% of Coinbase customers, who are mostly retail, have purchased crypto assets other than bitcoin.      Speaking at Consensus: Distributed, Brian Brooks, chief operating officer of the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), said he believes crypto companies could fall under a federal licensing regime rather than state-level money transmitter licenses. TAKEAWAY: This would lead to a more regulated and robust market infrastructure, which would boost both entrepreneurial and investor interest in crypto assets. It could also be enough to tempt some legacy financial institutions to set up crypto arms, injecting a further dose of legitimacy.      Binance.US has launched an OTC desk to enable trades of over $10,000. TAKEAWAY: U.S.-based institutions are still at this stage more likely to accumulate positions through the CME or the “blue chip” OTC desks such as B2C2 – but the potential market for Binance OTC amongst large traders and high-net-worth individuals could still be considerable, and the service could act as an additional on-ramp for large investors. It remains to be seen whether the OTC option will increase the overall volumes for Binance.US, or siphon off some of the exchange data as existing clients choose the more bespoke trading.      Crypto platform ErisX has become the first regulated U.S.-based exchange to offer ether futures contracts. These will be physically delivered with monthly and quarterly expirations. TAKEAWAY: This could change the attractiveness of ether as an investment asset from an institutional point of view – professional investors rarely take long-only or short-only bets, and the existence of regulated futures makes positions easier to hedge. But there is virtually no demand for physically settled bitcoin futures on ErisX, and relatively little demand elsewhere: Bakkt’s physically settled volume is miniscule compared to the CME’s cash-settled volume. So, will there be demand for ether futures? Another factor in demand is leverage, or in this case the lack of. On the other hand, the CME does not yet trade ether futures, so interested investors don’t have much to choose from.      Hut 8 Mining, one of Canada’s largest mining operations, reported falling revenue, decreased adjusted EBITDA margin and increased collateral requirements on debt in Q1. TAKEAWAY: This makes the third consecutive quarter revenue has declined, with the price increase failing to offset a decrease in the number of bitcoin mined – figures to watch as the subsidy per block going forward will be half what it was in Q1. (For more detail on Hut 8, see our in-depth report.)      Brooklyn Nets guard Spencer Dinwiddie spoke at Consensus: Distributed about his push to offer a piece of his future cash flows to investors via a crypto token. TAKEAWAY: Early days yet, and it remains to be seen what legal kinks have yet to emerge – but this offers a peek into a potential future in which sports contracts could be traded like securities, and fantasy football becomes a new type of portfolio management.

42404639,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdjXpi,1589788800,"18 Months In, Few People Use, Mine or Buy Privacy Coin Grin","Despite launching with considerable fanfare in early 2019, grin, the first cryptocurrency to test privacy protocol MimbleWimble, is showing no signs of life.      At its launch, professional investors poured funding — by some estimates, $100 million — into mining the cryptocurrency, with some even calling it a sort of “Bitcoin 2.0”.      Privacy without sacrificing scalability is the primary advantage of MimbleWimble, according to grin developers. The first grin coins were also issued via a so-called “fair launch” whereby, similar to bitcoin, all coins are minted by miners instead of being generated prior to the network going live.      See also: Electric Coin Company SDK Paves Way for Shielded Zcash Payments on Mobile      “Grin was probably the most crowded venture capital trade of 2019,” said Ryan Gentry, lead analyst at Multicoin Capital.      On-chain data suggests once-eager investors soured on the young cryptocurrency. Grin’s hash power, a measure of computing resources devoted to securing the network, and mining difficulty, which gauges the amount of power required to mine, started to collapse in August 2019. After nine consecutive months of decline, the trend shows no sign of reversing.      Grin’s planned hard forks, or systemwide upgrades, could also be responsible for its declining network activity. Every six months, the network executes these upgrades that change grin's mining algorithm to deter expensive, specialized mining equipment from dominating its hash power.      After the first fork, grin’s hashrate and difficulty climbed, but the second fork coincided with the steepest hashrate decline in the network’s short history. Grin is preparing for yet another drop in hashrate after a third next fork scheduled for July.      See also: Monero’s ‘Fluffypony’ Steps Down as Lead Maintainer of Privacy Coin Project      Even grin’s transaction count, a metric that could be easily manipulated to mask the network’s declining use, has dropped roughly 20% year to date, according to Coin Metrics. This smaller drop follows a more than 70% decrease in daily transactions through February and March 2019.      Grin developers say the cryptocurrency isn’t designed to cater to short-term speculative investors.      “Cryptocurrency is mostly a speculation game,” said grin developer John Tromp. “Grin is hurt in the short term by being speculation-unfriendly.”    Privacy problems    Adding to grin’s woes, San Francisco-based Dragonfly Capital published research six months ago describing an “attack” that could reveal the identities of 96% of active grin users.      To date, the grin team has not fixed the vulnerability.      Ivan Bogatyy, who wrote the report, said grin’s core developers are “among the strongest engineers in the space.” However, they “faced a very hard cold-start problem with incumbents"" such as monero (XMR) and zcash (ZEC) due to grin’s lack of “a robust privacy mechanism” to challenge leading privacy cryptocurrencies.      According to the people behind grin, Bogatyy’s report contains “many logical leaps” and the anonymity exploit is a known and “well-documented” problem.    Traders are not grinning    Traders also seemed to have lost interest in grin. Since last June, the privacy currency’s price — quoted in dollars and bitcoin — has only dropped.      When it first launched, for example, New York City-based crypto fund Iterative Capital briefly supported grin on its over-the-counter trading desk and considered mining. But it didn’t take long for the firm to lose interest.      “Buying demand was so low and the technology was in such an incipient form that we quickly stopped bothering,” said Iterative Capital’s founder and managing partner Chris Dannen.

42404630,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdjXhq,1589774745,Trading Contest on Synthetix Aims to Showcase Speed of New DEX Tech,"Synthetix is putting over $40,000 in crypto on the line to entice users to try out the faster beta of its decentralized exchange (DEX).      ""While DEXs offer significant improvements over CEXs [centralized exchanges] in terms of safety of funds and transparency, there is typically a painful trade-off on transaction speed,"" Synthetix CEO Kain Warwick told CoinDesk in an email.      It doesn't cost anything more than a tweet to participate in the demo DEX, but users need to act fast because they only have till Tuesday to place in the top 20 and win a piece of the 50,000 SNX the company has put up in prizes.      But the real reason traders might be interested over time is because this project could demo a world where DEXs become feasible at scale.      Everyone knows the main use case for crypto is trading, which has led to a massive and glaring irony for crypto users. As much as they might like the decentralized nature of these assets, in order to trade efficiently they rely on centralized crypto exchanges, which tend to be vulnerable to cybercriminals. On a DEX, users trade straight from their own wallets.      A long-held dream for crypto has been to create DEX software that allows users to custody their own crypto until the moment of trade and then trade directly with counterparties. That's why even one of the biggest CEXs, Binance, has built a DEX. But many DEXs have proven more centralized than they admit.      Synthetix's beta relies on a deployment of the Optimistic Virtual Machine (OVM) from Optimism, the company behind the latest scaling and usability solution for Ethereum.      Read more: Plasma Became Optimism and It Might Just Save Ethereum      ""I think optimistic rollup is the first Ethereum layer 2 solution that checks all the boxes for DeFi,"" Hayden Adams of Uniswap told CoinDesk, explaining that effectively replicating the Ethereum virtual machine on the second layer takes a lot of headaches out of putting different applications together for developers, making the so-called ""money legos"" much more viable.    How Synthetix works    Synthetix is a platform for making synthetic assets. That is, users don't trade ETH for USD, they trade sETH for sUSD, where the underlying asset is actually the SNX token, used to create synthetic versions of the asset.      This is ultimately much like how MakerDAO works. Users put up a crypto asset (ETH, BAT, USDC) and they are allowed to mint a new asset (the stablecoin dai). For both MakerDAO and Synthetix, there is a pre-set collateralization ratio (150% and 800%, respectively). In both cases, those staking the crypto asset are creating a debt when they mint the new asset, one that can be repaid by returning it.      The synthetic asset holds its peg because that's the value the smart contract enforces. Imagine a user putting in $8 in SNX to mint one sUSD. She couldn't mint any more. But then imagine the value of SNX doubled. The smart contract would then allow her to mint one more sUSD, because the value of her staked SNX allowed it under the smart contract's parameters.      Synthetix – currently the second-largest DeFi protocol, according to DeFi Pulse, with $119.3 million in locked-in value – already runs a DEX and it's already able to add some efficiency to trading by removing the order book (where actual people post offers for trades they want to make). All trades made on Synthetix are effectively traded with the platform itself.      ""The other side of the trade is just the pooled debt that is Synthetix,"" Justin Moses, Synthetix CTO, told CoinDesk. SNX stakers collateralizing the system get rewarded by a 0.3% trading fee levied on every trade.      The five most popular tokens (or ""synths"") held on the platform right now are sBTC, sETH, sLINK, iBTC and iTRX, in that order. The ""i"" in those last two stands for ""inverse,"" because they are short positions, going up in value when the synthesized asset goes down.      Synthetix teamed with Optimism to create a DEX that could be competitive in terms of speed with traditional crypto exchanges, and that's what the two teams are testing now with this contest. As of 3:00 UTC on Monday, 1,156 wallets had been created and daily volume was listed at $11.3 million.      The contest runs till 14:00 UTC on Tuesday, May 19. Right now, a user would have to break 32% in gains to break the top 20, but this is crypto and prices move fast.    The case for Optimism    ""In Synthetix the thing for us is, if people can see the price of an asset in the real world, and they can tell it hasn't gotten on-chain yet, they can try to take advantage of that,"" Moses said. That's the problem of front-running, which has always plagued DEX makers.      Read more: ‘Predatory’ Bots Exploiting Decentralized Crypto Exchanges: Report      Synthetix has a complicated set of smart contracts, all of which are very interrelated. ""What's important for us is not having different versions of things in different places,"" Moses said.      The OVM allows a team to write smart contracts off Ethereum basically as if they are writing on Ethereum itself. ""It supports theoretically any Ethereum smart contract,"" Optimism CEO Jinglan Wang told CoinDesk.      The crux of the OVM's speed improvement can be explained simply: It is designed so users don't have to wait for transactions to get validated by nodes all over the network to keep doing new transactions.      ""You don't force everyone to do the computation in order to progress the state,"" Wang said. ""With optimistic rollup you assume all the transactions are valid.""      That's why they call it ""optimistic.""      It's optimistic but it's not gullible. Underlying the system is an anti-fraud measure. Each node entering transactions on the OVM has a bond. If it processes a fraudulent transaction its bond gets slashed. Not only that, though, but every node that adds a block to that fraudulent block also gets slashed. This gives everyone in the system an incentive to, first of all, not commit fraud and, second, to keep an eye on their peers (because the sooner fraud gets spotted, the less it costs the whole system).      The shorthand for this approach is a ""rollup"" and Optimism specializes in ""optimistic rollups."" It's a blockchain that works off Ethereum, while still relying on the mothership to provide security. If that sounds a lot like a ""sidechain"" to those who have followed this space for a while, you can be forgiven for struggling to see the difference.      Read more: Decentralized Exchanges Aren’t Living Up to Their Name – And Data Proves It      There is another iteration out there, zk-rollups, that offer additional security guarantees, but a developer familiar with Ethereum's Solidity language might not be able to hop right into those, according to Wang.      ""The superior thing in my mind is something you can use today,"" she said. ""I would also argue that the security of optimistic rollups is pretty good.""    Sidebar    As a minor aside, both Optimism and Synthetix are re-invented projects. Optimism was born out of the Plasma group, an Ethereum scaling project. Synthetix used to be a stablecoin, Havven, funded by a $30 million initial coin offering.      Similarly, some of tech's greatest giants, like Twitter and Slack, were born out of pivots, and it will be interesting to see if two pivots combined can show crypto's decentralized coins a path out of the centralized casinos that are today's exchanges.      Because when a crypto user trusts someone else's keys, they are betting on more than an investment thesis.",POSITIVE,ETH | SNX,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | SNX | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/05/18/trading-contest-on-synthetix-aims-to-showcase-speed-of-new-dex-tech,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d9999e414be731d28f741e57e970d77c2286b1df-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
