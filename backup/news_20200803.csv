42384309,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAWmzN,1596488020,NetWalker Ransomware Gang Is Storing $7M in Bitcoin in SegWit Cold Storage,"NetWalker ransomware, which last week triggered cybersecurity flash warnings from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), has extorted $25 million in bitcoin from its victims during the months of the pandemic, according to a report by McAfee and CipherTrace.    NetWalker is a “ransomware-as-a-service” that gains its access through COVID-19 phishing emails, encrypts infected systems and steals internal documents. Ransomware operators then threaten to publish victims’ documents if they fail to pay up.  Victims, most of whom are large organizations such as companies and governments, appear to been obliging the hackers throughout the pandemic. McAfee and CipherTrace traced 2,795 bitcoin ($25 million) to NetWalker wallet addresses from March 1 through July 27.  NetWalker’s developers refined their handling of bitcoin payments months before the pandemic began by swapping in SegWit addresses in place of legacy wallets, the report said.  “This transition into SegWit could indicate that they are utilizing a new hardware wallet to store their BTC or just an indication of a desire for cheaper transactions,” said Pamela Clegg, director of financial investigations at CipherTrace.  Clegg told CoinDesk that “large amounts of bitcoin” – up to 640 – appear to be sitting in cold storage. She said smaller amounts have been deposited at Russian crypto exchange CointoCard.org.  The cybersecurity report follows last week’s warning from the FBI that NetWalker has been successfully exploiting COVID-19 in recent months. The FBI warns targeted institutions against paying hackers’ bitcoin ransom payments.

42384328,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAWnFj,1596487081,Zephyr Teachout: Take Back the Economy From Economists,"When I answer the phone, Zephyr Teachout quickly explains our call might be shorter than planned. Both she and I are at the whim of her two-year-old toddler, who is sleeping and could wake at any time.      Teachout, a law professor at Fordham University in New York, is best known for her runs for governor of the state and for Congress from New York’s 19th district (both races she lost). She has also written numerous books, including her latest, “BREAK 'EM UP: Recovering Our Freedom from Big Ag, Big Tech, and Big Money.” Our discussion comes the day after historic Big Tech antitrust hearings in Congress.      Teachout sees the antitrust discussion as a flashpoint for understanding how democracy and corruption collide. To her, concentrations of private power, as with the Big Tech companies, can't be fixed with, say, campaign finance reform. These companies are a threat to the public sphere and our ability as individuals to make decisions about the future.      We discussed the antitrust hearings in Congress, what she means by a “f--k-off economy,” and the ""parallel governments"" that massive companies have created for users of their services. She is not currently knowledgeable about blockchain and cryptocurrency, but sees them as potentially useful tools for achieving economic decentralization.      Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.      What was your reaction to the six-hour antitrust hearings yesterday?      Wow. It was a beautiful thing. Congressman David Cicilline [D-R.I.]was totally clear: “This is about democracy versus monopoly. You guys work for us. We're serious. We're going to do serious things. And we have some questions.” He had this totally electrifying tone.      And the committee came prepared. They had documents and they focused on the evidence at hand. It couldn't have been more different than the Mark Zuckerberg Senate hearing after the Cambridge Analytica scandal, where senators were impressed with his earnestness and just made polite requests of him.      See also: Why We Need a Federal Privacy Law      We have to see the documents to see whether actions these companies took are in fact illegal under current antitrust law. But there is evidence that suggests violations of existing antitrust laws and evidence of things that aren't violations of laws but are deeply disturbing, for example where platforms use their power to copy or bully other companies.      What’s a striking example of that bullying power?      Amazon. [CEO Jeff] Bezos' first answer as to whether they used their access to data to launch and boost their own competing products was ""No."" And then there's great reporting that said the answer should be yes. So Bezos said, 'Well, our policy is no, but I can't promise you it’s not done.'      Everybody understands that to sell online, you need to go through Amazon. Sellers truly do not have a choice unless they happen to start with a million dollars and want to make one. Now there's a growing understanding that Amazon has this data insight into the companies that depend on it, and is directly competing with them. Bezos then was forced to make the concession that seemed clear all along: that these companies are competitors rather than partners.    There is no such thing as no-governance regimes.    He always talks about the great partnerships, and I was reminded of the mob. Partnership can be a very loaded term depending on whom you're talking to.      Obviously, the best way to stop companies like Amazon from doing that is by mandating that you’re either the platform or you're competing on the platform. You can’t be both. You need structural responses like that, otherwise, you're just playing whack-a-mole.      How do monopolistic companies create parallel government structures?      There are clearly forms of private government that are smuggled inside our current public government and growing in power. If you ask somebody who is an Amazon seller what judicial system they care about, they care a lot about Amazon's system and their own mechanisms for delisting sellers.      These companies have their own intellectual property regime, their own punishment regime, and that is as important if not more so than the public one if you are caught within the web of one of these private, growing governments.      See also: Thibault Schrepel - Blockchain Code Can Fill In When Antitrust Law Fails      This is a very old idea that we just forgot in 1980, but understood for most American history. It’s that private power always tends to form into a government of itself. And all governments have judicial systems. Sometimes systems are internal to the company, like Amazon's appeals processor or Facebook's content moderation system, about whether you get to be on the platform or not.      They also use the tool of arbitration, where a company is paying judges (or employees) who then don't have to follow the rules of making evidence public. These mechanisms of arbitration and secret decision making make it really hard for people to tell stories about what's actually happening inside these private regimes.      Mark Zuckerberg has said Facebook is now more like a government than a traditional company.      The funny thing is these guys basically tell you they want to be a government all the time. It's like Oprah Winfrey used to say, “If you listen really closely, people tell you who they are and who they're going to be.” They all say, “We want to govern you,” and because they are in an economic sphere, we don’t hear that as “Alexander the Great is coming for democracy.” But that's what they're doing.      You bring up decentralization a lot in the book. How might cryptocurrencies play a role in that?      I think of these systems as incredibly important, but it all depends on what the governance mechanism is. When Amazon recently applied for a patent to use blockchain technology, which would basically require every seller to keep a ledger of where all their supplies come from, then basically the technology itself isn't doing a lot of decentralization. The technology is in service of a centralized power.      There is no such thing as no-governance regimes. When I talk to crypto advocates, they’ll often frame it as if it is a world with no governance. But there is never an absence of governance. In the end, someone controls supply.      See also: Russian Activists Use Bitcoin, and the Kremlin Doesn't Like It      Technology itself can't do quite as much work as I think some of the advocates think. But again, let’s have that discussion, because I think there's just unbelievably powerful ways in which it can be used for the good.      My question for everybody is, really, when push comes to shove, who holds the trump cards? Who makes the decision? It's never nobody.    A core question about privacy is “Privacy from whom?”    You talk about developing a “f--k-off” economy. What do you mean by that?      I'm trying to take the economy back from the economists. They’ve been acting like priests for 40 years and telling us that we, as mere residents of this society, have no business messing with economic terms like monopoly or antitrust, and we should just trust their assessments of efficiency. When you take the economy back for people and not economists, then things like wages matter again.      See also: Social Media Bans ‘Highlight the Profound Censorship on Web 2.0’      We need an economy where people have the knowledge that if their boss is really awful, they can say ""f--k off"" walk away. For that to happen, you need there to be actual competitors you could walk away to. Sometimes people say, ""Well, there's plenty of competition. There's five companies that do this thing."" But there isn’t a real sense that there are meaningful options. And people should have that. I want to reclaim the idea that freedom in the workplace is essential.      How do you see privacy being affected by a handful of companies controlling so much of our economy?      There's good research that our privacy controls got a lot worse after Facebook merged with Instagram, because they no longer needed to compete to actually protect us better than the other. There's a nice paper on this, “The Antitrust Case Against Facebook” by Dina Srinivasan, which argues that merger was followed pretty quickly by Facebook no longer keeping its old promises towards its users. I don't think that antitrust is going to do everything for privacy, but I think antimonopoly more broadly and a concern about power should.      Privacy means different things to different people. If you see Facebook and Amazon as forms of government, then Facebook or Amazon saying they're protecting your privacy isn't a really great comfort. Your government already knows everything about you.      See also: Money Reimagined: China’s ‘Cold War’ Blockchain Strategy      A core question about privacy is ""privacy from whom?"" There is a privacy relationship between an individual and centralized power that isn't just about an individual but the public at large or the formal forms of government.      We should move, as people are with facial recognition, towards an arena where some stuff just can't be collected at all. We say you cannot just take out your spleen and give it to somebody or sell it. There are certain things we should have an absolute ban on collecting and are not governed by contract law.      My fear is any privacy regime is trumped by contract law, because when people can individually contract stuff away you have asymmetries of power. Right now the existing tech behemoths have a huge incentive in maintaining a business model whose goal is to maximize the information they have about people and we need to be moving towards an opposing model.      So what's the path forward?      We're in this exciting moment where there's a lot of new antitrust energy, but it's pretty new. I have particular solutions, particular things that I think we should do. But more important is to change our overall politics to make them more fundamentally about antitrust. I bet you haven't asked your lawmakers about what they think about power. We have to recognize that we're not going to get to the policy solutions until we get the power dynamics in politics that we want.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/08/03/zephyr-teachout-take-back-the-economy-from-economists,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8925579ca64b5367c731f324436a55e4a030ea27-2560x1920.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384329,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAWnGz,1596486785,"Blockchain Bites: Hedge Fund Down, Banana Bets and the Twitter Hack Fallout","Another crypto hedge fund is winding down, Huobi launched a new unit to invest in DeFi and the Twitter hacker is reportedly a bitcoin millionaire.      You’re reading Blockchain Bites, the daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news, and why they’re significant. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk’s newsletters here.    Top shelf    Fund Down Neural Capital, a crypto hedge fund, has closed, having lost half its money since launching in 2017. Three people familiar with the matter said the fund’s crypto-assets were liquidated in December and the fund is in the process of refunding leftover money to investors, a process taking longer than expected. At its height, Neural Capital managed over $13 million from over 40 investors, including Greylock partner Joshua Elman and Expa partner Hooman Radfar. It joins several funds founded in 2017 that have announced closures in 2020, including Adaptive Capital, Prime Factor Capital and Tetras Capital.      Banana Fund U.S. prosecutors are seeking to return $6.5 million in bitcoin to victims of the “Banana.Fund” crowdfunding project, which the government described in court papers as a Ponzi scheme. In a forfeiture suit against the cryptocurrency account storing the funds, prosecutors allege Banana.Fund’s unnamed administrator admitted to investors his project had flopped, promised to return $1.7 million to them and then failed to do so. The operator then pivoted to a laundering and refund scheme that ultimately resulted in the U.S. Secret Service’s (USSS) seizure of 482 bitcoin (BTC) and 1,721,868 tether (USDT), court documents show.      Twitter Hacker The 17-year-old thought to be behind the recent Twitter hack reportedly owns more than $3 million worth of bitcoin. The alleged hacker, Graham Ivan Clark, stands accused of 17 counts of communications fraud, 11 counts of fraudulent use of personal information, one count of breaking into an electronic device and another for organized fraud. His bail was set at $725,000. Federal officials are also charging Nima Fazeli and Mason John Sheppard with aiding in the “intentional access of a protected computer” and conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering, according to criminal complaints published Friday.      DeFi Lab Crypto exchange operator Huobi Group is forming a new fund to invest tens of millions of dollars of its own capital in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Huobi Group said in an announcement Monday it has launched a new business unit called Huobi DeFi Labs to manage the fund. The group will focus on research, investment and incubation of DeFi-related projects, and has brought on former banker Sharlyn Wu to lead the initiative.      Hacker Effects A Spanish cryptocurrency payments app and card issuer has admitted it won’t be able immediately to repay users affected by Friday’s $1.4 million hack and has offered a compromise instead. Madrid-based 2gether said Sunday it hadn't been able to find the funds to reimburse all users the €1.2 million stolen by hackers – 26.79% of the firm's total funds – on Friday evening. The firm has offered to reimburse investors in native 2GT tokens at the issuance price of just under $0.06. ""We can assure you, with a great deal of chagrin, that if we could face this theft with our own funds, we would,"" the announcement reads.    Market intel    Tokenized BTC The supply of tokenized bitcoin grew more than 70% in July. More than 20,000 BTC (~$225 million) are now tokenized using Ethereum-based protocols. Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) represents over 76% of the total tokenized bitcoin supply with over 15,500 BTC tokenized. The total supply grew by roughly $96 million in July, following June’s record growth.      Dex Volume July trading volume on decentralized exchanges set its second consecutive record high, rising 174% from June, according to data from Dune Analytics. Aggregate trading volume on decentralized exchanges reached $4,32 billion in July, up from $1.52 billion in June. 41% of July’s volume came from Uniswap, on which traders speculate on assets ranging from “a better Bitcoin” to a coin named after fried chicken.    Opinion    Value Judgments Crypto is inherently disruptive. In this week’s Crypto Long & Short newsletter, CoinDesk’s Galen Moore asks whether decentralization – and its attendant change making – creates or destroys value within the crypto space. “The “Robinhood Effect” may represent a threat to crypto from stocks, which also seem to now trade unencumbered by fundamentals, via onramps that broaden access,” he writes.      DeFi Defines Ethereum DeFi Dad, an organizing member of the Ethereal Summit and Sessions and DeFi super user, thinks Etheruem has found a narrative it can latch onto. “Five years ago, you could argue Ethereum was attempting to do too much. Even two to three years ago, that was still a valid hypothesis, with stagnant adoption,” he writes.

Bitcoin (BTC) is trading around $11,417 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET), gaining 2.1% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $10,913-$11,485  BTC above 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bullish signal for market technicians.    A bullish run for bitcoin past $12,131 was interrupted Sunday, as bitcoin endured a sudden drop, losing over $1,400 within a brief period of time.      Read More: Flash Crash: Bitcoin Price Slides by $1.4K in Minutes      “The market had rallied strongly from $9,000 to over $12,000,” said Rupert Douglas, head of institutional sales for crypto brokerage Koine. “The reaction down was purely to shake out the weak longs who had got in at the higher levels,” Douglas added.      Indeed, hourly liquidations spiked to over $147 million on derivatives platform BitMEX on Sunday. As the price began trending downward, derivatives traders going long saw their positions automatically sold, the crypto equivalent of a margin call, on the Seychelles-based exchange.      The highest BitMEX liquidation during the session was a $10 million long position. “There were a lot of high-levered long day traders who were liquidated and are licking their wounds as a result,” said John Willock, CEO of digital asset liquidity provider Tritum.      The amount of spot bitcoin trading on Coinbase Sunday was higher than normal, at $318 million. In fact, Sunday was the second-highest volume day in the past month, following a $446 million day on July 27.      “The rest of the market seems to have had a big appetite to accumulate bitcoin at $1,000 off, now working its way back to $12,000 and beyond,” Willock added. “I see it as a stumble and we're back on track.”      Read More: Bitcoin Investors Unshaken by Sunday’s Flash Crash, Data Suggests      Bitcoin is still 5.8% off of its Sunday high, while ether is down 5%.

Ether was not spared Sunday’s flash crash, falling as low as $325 before recovering. Some traders claim they took advantage of the dip. “We had expected ETH to fall back to the low $300s and accumulated there,” said Jack Tan, managing partner of Taiwan-based quantitative trading firm Kronos Research.      Karl Samsen, vice president of capital markets for trading firm Global Digital Assets, told CoinDesk ether is separating itself from bitcoin and is actually helping push the alternative cryptocurrency, or altcoin, market. “Bitcoin is rebalancing itself, as it was the previous leader,” Samsen said. “Ether is tearing up the market, and it's bringing alts up with it.

Matic said Monday the grants would incentivize promising DeFi projects to build on its protocol, rather than directly onto Ethereum.  Grants will be paid in matic, a native staking token currently trading at $0.02, according to CoinGecko.  Matic has already given out more than $1 million in grants, although it hasn't revealed any of the beneficiaries.  Matic Network is an Ethereum sidechain that can handle up to 65,000 transactions per second; it raised $5 million in an initial exchange offering in 2019.  In a statement, Matic said building a DeFi space on its protocol would give projects scalability with ready access to the Ethereum mainnet.  In a speech in June, Matic COO Sandeep Nailwal said the company had already had some DeFi projects move to its protocol.  Crypto derivatives platform FTX said last week it was building a decentralized exchange (DEX) on Solana, another scalable network that would be interoperable with Ethereum.  As with Matic, FTX said building a DEX on Solana gave it sufficient throughput while remaining plugged into the Ethereum DeFi space, worth over $4.2 billion at press time.

42384320,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAWn9R,1596466958,Electric Capital's New $110M VC Fund Is 90% Institutions,"Crypto venture capital firm Electric Capital has closed its second fund at $110 million. Of the money raised, 90% of it is institutional capital.      “The early-adopter, forward-thinking investors are now significantly off zero and now everyone is looking at those guys and saying, ‘Oh, maybe we should be off zero as well,’” Electric Capital co-founder Avichal Garg told CoinDesk in an interview.      The new fund includes multiple undisclosed university endowments, Garg said, a potential bellwether for traditional investors becoming more crypto-comfortable.      Electric’s new fund will invest in startup equity, crypto tokens or a hybrid of the two. Checks will be in the $1 million to $10 million range and focus on seed and Series A rounds. The firm’s first round raised $35 million, said Garg and fellow co-founder Curtis Spencer.      Initial investments from the new fund include DerivaDEX on the equity side; token investments in base layers Celo and NEAR; and liquid holdings of bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and maker (MKR).      The second fund will continue Electric’s three-pronged focus on Layer 1 protocols, decentralized finance (DeFi) and crypto-enabled businesses.

After VCs began reaching out during the last bull run, the two decided to make it official, founding Electric in early 2018.      Current investments include Anchorage, Bison Trails, Bitwise, Coda, Elrond, Mobilecoin and others.      As for what drove institutional interest this time around, Garg said macroeconomic conditions played a major role.      “The thing that really tipped it was all the money printing that happened in March,” he said.

Hackers said 30,000 of the company's computers were caught up in the attack, although the number has since been disputed by a person familiar with the investigation, Reuters said.  The conversation between the hackers and CWT was made public on Saturday, providing a rare insight into how the deal to recover the company's files was struck.  In the conversation, a CWT representative can be seen asking how to recover their files and what steps were needed to resolve the problem.  The company subsequently confirmed in a statement its systems were back online and that the incident had passed, but declined to comment further due to an ongoing investigation.

42375639,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw9NyH,1596457340,First Mover: July Was a Runaway Month for Crypto Returns,"Crypto traders didn't need to work too hard to make money last month. They just had to be in the market.  Every digital asset in the CoinDesk 20 ended the month in the black. Bitcoin benefited from bets against the U.S. dollar while ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, gained from speculation over the future of ""decentralized finance,"" known as DeFi.  You’re reading First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.  Bitcoin rose 24% during the month, its best July in eight years, and was changing hands as of late Sunday at around $11,100 – even after a flash crash earlier in the day that saw the price plunge about $1,400 in a matter of minutes.  The largest cryptocurrency by market value continues to benefit alongside gold as the ongoing economic toll of the coronavirus raises expectations of further rescue packages and stimulus from central banks and governments. Gold, seen by many investors in traditional markets as a hedge against inflation, has been hitting new records and on Sunday was closing in on $2,000 an ounce.  The credit-rating firm Fitch on Friday placed a ""negative outlook"" on the United States' triple-A rating, writing in a press release that a ""resurgence of inflation"" could force the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, ""adversely affecting debt dynamics.""  ""Paper money hit a low versus non-quantitatively-easible money like gold and bitcoin,"" Dan Morehead, CEO of the cryptocurrency investment firm Pantera Capital, wrote last week in a monthly letter.  Bitcoin is now up 56% on the year, vastly outperforming the Standard & Poor's 500 Index, which is up 1.3% in 2020. The gauge of U.S. stocks rose 5.5% in July.  Ether, the second-biggest cryptocurrency by market value, jumped 54% in July and is now trading around $380, its highest in two years. Ethereum has become the blockchain of choice for most of the biggest projects in DeFi, where decentralized lending and trading systems have now garnered some $4.2 billion in total value locked, quadruple the amount just two months earlier.  ""All this hype surrounding DeFi has further fueled Ethereum's rise,"" Jay Hao, CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange OKEx, wrote last week, noting that trading volumes had jumped on decentralized exchanges.  ""Even if the DeFi bubble were to burst, it seems that it cannot quell the enthusiasm for ether,"" Hao wrote. ""In actual fact, it may bolster its price further as the capital flows from DeFi tokens back into ether.""  July's top-performing digital asset, Chainlink's LINK token, surged 70%.  As CoinDesk Senior Markets Reporter Daniel Cawrey detailed in First Mover on Friday, LINK represents the leading ""oracle"" – an automated price feed – for many DeFi applications built atop the Ethereum blockchain. And the role is potentially so lucrative that many other projects are now vying to grab market share in the oracle race.  Among the CoinDesk 20, the only tokens that didn't post big price gains in July were the stablecoins tether and USDC, which by definition don't move much because they're pegged to the dollar.  It's somewhat ironic, since the outstanding amount of stablecoins has grown rapidly, swelling past $12 billion.  ""If you were in a stablecoin, you missed out the gains that bitcoin or ethereum or chainlink were giving,"" said Joe DiPasquale, CEO of the cryptocurrency hedge fund BitBull Capital.  Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch  BTC: Price: $11,225 (BTC) | 24-Hr High: $11,295 | 24-Hr Low: $10,956  Trend: Bitcoin's bullish bias remains intact despite Sunday's sudden flash crash.  The top cryptocurrency by market value was trading in the green near $11,225 at press time, having dropped by $1,400 to levels under $10,700 yesterday. The price slide erased (or engulfed) the uptick seen in the preceding four trading days.  Bearish engulfing candles like that formed Sunday are widely considered early signs of an impending bearish reversal. However, the drop looks to be nothing more than a healthy pullback, which often occur after a notable rally.  Bitcoin rose by $2,900 in the 11 days to Aug. 31, pushing the widely tracked 14-day relative strength index into overbought territory above 70. As such, a pullback was likely and expected. In the past, bitcoin has seen bigger price drops during bull runs.  ""The latest bitcoin pullback was only 15%. There were at least six pullbacks of 30%+ or more last bull market uptrend,"" popular analyst Josh Rager tweeted early Monday.  And while Sunday's sell-off was the biggest single-day decline since May 10, it failed to take out the former hurdle turned-support of $10,500 (February high). Prices closed (UTC) well above that level on Sunday, confirming a bullish breakout for the week.  Looking ahead, a re-test of $12,000 cannot be ruled out, as the 14-day RSI has rolled over to under-bought (or bullish) territory below 70.00. Upward momentum looks strong with the 10-day simple moving average (SMA) trending north.  The bullish outlook would only be invalidated if the cryptocurrency establishes a strong foothold under $10,500.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | ETH | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,"Bradley Keoun, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/08/03/first-mover-july-was-a-runaway-month-for-crypto-returns,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/86269f69785043ae02c1aa25623758abb885ae7d-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384326,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAWnET,1596455869,"Bitcoin Investors Unshaken by Sunday’s Flash Crash, Data Suggests","Bitcoin investors appear to have shrugged off Sunday’s violent price crash, according to one data metric.    In just minutes, prices fell by around $1,400 from over $12,000 to sub-$10,700 levels Sunday.  The rapid fall crowded out over $1 billion in bullish leverage from the futures market.  Yet, as the cryptocurrency declined, users withdrew more coins from exchanges than they deposited, suggesting holders were not spooked by the big mover lower.  Cryptocurrency exchanges witnessed a net outflow of 4,264 BTC on Sunday, marking a sharp rise from Saturday's figure of 436 BTC, according to data provided by the blockchain intelligence firm Glassnode.  Investors tend to pull funds out from exchanges when they expect a sustained price rally and move their coins to exchanges when they want to liquidate their holdings; for example, before an expected price drop.  As such, Sunday's data would suggest that investors shrugged off the crash having confidence in bitcoin’s long-term prospects.  Sunday's flash crash is rumored to have been caused by an Asian whale, or big trader, who took profit on a long position after prices hit $12,000 amid thin volumes.  The resulting small price drop is said to have set off a chain reaction of forced unwindings of long positions by exchanges, rapidly leading to the bigger decline.  At the time of writing, bitcoin is back up near $11,200 – still up nearly 56% on a year-to-date basis.

42384287,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAPHMZ,1596448800,Crypto Hedge Fund Neural Capital Closes After Losing Half Its Money,"Neural Capital, a hedge fund that traded cryptocurrency assets, has quietly shuttered.    The fund has lost half its money since launching in 2017 and is in the process of refunding leftover money to investors, according to three people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified.  The sources said the fund’s crypto-assets were liquidated in December and some cash is still being held up in escrow, months longer than expected.  By 2019, Neural Capital managed over $13 million that drew investments of $250,000 on up from over 40 investors, including Greylock partner Joshua Elman and Expa partner Hooman Radfar, according to financial records.  The fund withdrew its registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in December and stopped submitting obligatory filings to the state of California and the federal agency this year.  It joins a horde of funds to close in 2020, shy of the three-year mark, after forming around the time of the 2017 crypto boom — notably, Adaptive Capital, Prime Factor Capital and Tetras Capital.    The fund’s managers, Arij “Ari” Nazir and Christopher Keshian, were new to the hedge fund industry and involved in more than one fund when they started Neural Capital.    Nazir was a University of Virginia master’s student who interned for the White House in the spring of 2015 during Barack Obama’s second presidential term.  Keshian, who graduated from the University of Virginia’s business school with Nazir in 2015, was chief executive officer of Decentralized Capital Corporation, a Panamanian fiat-to-crypto money transmitter, until 2017.  While managing the fund, Nazir and Keshian were advisors of Protocol Ventures, an institutional investor in multiple cryptocurrency funds that included Neural Capital, whose logo has been removed from Protocol’s website.  Keshian also started Apex Capital, a Protocol-like crypto fund-of-funds, with Joseph M. Bradley, Neural Capital’s head of investor relations, as they were getting Neural Capital off the ground. Apex Capital failed to launch after unsuccessfully attempting to raise $100 million in assets through a digital token sale to meet minimum invested fund amount requirements.  Keshian left Neural Capital in July 2018, according to his LinkedIn profile, after what the sources described as a falling-out with Nazir.    Keshian told CoinDesk he has not kept in touch with Nazir since leaving Neural Capital. “Right now, I’m working on a project that is still very much under wraps,” said Keshian, declining to comment further.

At Hillsborough County Courthouse, Florida, on Saturday, the attorney representing Graham Ivan Clark said his client owned 300 bitcoin, the Tampa Bay Times reported Sunday.  CoinDesk data shows this stash is worth $3.4 million at current market prices.  Bail was set at $725,000 during Clark's first court appearance on Saturday.  Arrested Friday, authorities see Clark as the ringleader and mastermind of July's ""CryptoForHealth"" Twitter hack, a coordinated attack of some 30 high profile accounts, including CoinDesk, that promised to double the money of users who sent cryptocurrency.  In total, some $117,000 worth of cryptocurrency went to the hackers in one afternoon.  Two accomplices have also been charged in California.  In an investigation last year, authorities confiscated 400 bitcoin from Clark, but later returned 300.  Although prosecutors have suggested Clark's bitcoin stash was illegally acquired, his attorney has argued it was legitimate because the authorities returned it.  Clark now stands accused on 17 counts of communications fraud, 11 counts of fraudulent use of personal information, as well as one count of breaking into an electronic device and another for organized fraud.

42384289,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAPHP5,1596445200,Inside a Crypto 'Ponzi': How the $6.5M Banana.Fund Fraud Unravelled,"U.S. prosecutors are seeking to return $6.5 million in allegedly scammed bitcoin to victims of the “Banana.Fund” crowdfunding project, which the government described in court papers as a Ponzi scheme.      In a forfeiture suit against the cryptocurrency account storing the funds, prosecutors allege Banana.Fund’s unnamed administrator admitted to investors his project had flopped, promised to return $1.7 million to them and then failed to do so. The operator then pivoted to a laundering and refund scheme that ultimately resulted in the U.S. Secret Service’s (USSS) seizure of 482 bitcoin (BTC) and 1,721,868 tether (USDT).      The lawsuit, filed July 29 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, seeks to grant the federal government formal ownership of the assets so it can return them to the victims.      The suit did not identify the operator of Banana.fund. But several victims of the alleged scam, and documents reviewed by CoinDesk, show the outfit was run by a British national named Richard Matthew John O’Neill aka “Jo Cook.""      One of the victims, Mike Koenen, told CoinDesk that since at least May 2018 he has been pushing the USSS to investigate Banana.Fund and O’Neill.      Documents reviewed by CoinDesk show that by November 2019, agents with the USSS San Francisco field office were email-canvassing likely victims for information on Richard O’Neill. Law enforcement had frozen O’Neill’s Poloniex account over a year before.      Neither O’Neill nor the Department of Justice responded to requests for comment.      The forfeiture suit represents perhaps the most substantial development yet in a little-known scheme that ran through the height of bitcoin’s historic late-2017 price pump and apparently went belly-up within months of the market’s pop, the documents reveal.    Peeling back the fraud    Banana.Fund’s white paper describes a crowdfunded business development company that shepherds fledgling startups through their earliest stages while offering operational transparency to their seed investors.      O’Neill told CoinTelegraph in January 2017 that Banana.Fund would “use blockchain for what it is good for: implementing transparent and irreversible global transactions.” In his view, he was “creating a level playing field for all users to pursue their business ideas, free of charge.”      Investing in O’Neill’s own business idea was not free of charge, however.      The buy-in started at 0.02 BTC, said Telegram user Dutch_Giant, who heard about Banana.Fund on the now-defunct message board MoneyMakersforum.      “The bigger deposit you made, the bigger part of the business you got,” Dutch_Giant said. He put in 0.024 bitcoin – “about $60 at the time.”      Other investors went even bigger on O’Neill’s crowdfunding darling, internal documents show. One user invested 82 bitcoin and nine others contributed 10 bitcoin or more. In all, 417 investors claim to have lost a combined 481 bitcoin, worth almost $5.5 million today, to Banana.Fund.      Those figures come from a spreadsheet of “verified refund claims” that O’Neill began compiling on Jan. 2, 2018, when he emailed Banana.Fund investors that they could be refunded nearly three times the dollar value of their original investment – but not their value in bitcoin.      “Banana.Fund is a failed project,” O’Neill said in a project announcement whose text was shared with CoinDesk and referenced in the criminal complaint. He claimed that while Banana.Fund had already spent around a third of investors’ $600,000 pie on overhead, he had ridden the remaining bitcoin through late 2017’s heights and could now refund them triple their original investment in USDT, a stablecoin that usually trades 1-for-1 with the dollar.      “We've failed up!” he said. He claimed to have $1,730,000 in USDT for refunds. “Pure dumb luck.”      His investors would have been far luckier had they never locked their bitcoin up in Banana.Fund, the DOJ points out. Banana.Fund’s founder, referred to in the suit only as “Person 1,” only ""stated that due to the increased value of bitcoin, investors would receive more than their initial investment in U.S. dollars, although, realistically, they would all still lose money because of the increased value of bitcoin.”    A calculated risk    Prosecutors allege that ""Person 1"" had an account balance of $11 million and could therefore easily pay back even Banana.Fund’s biggest investors. They further allege that “Person 1” spent the weeks leading up to his USDT conversion “buying and selling multiple coins for personal gain” and attempted one withdrawal to buy a house.      O’Neill “literally gambled with our BTC on Poloniex and he had few good trades,” said another victim of the alleged scam, Kris Zelisko, who invested 1.01 bitcoin in Banana.Fund. “Also, BTC went up in the meantime.”      Prosecutors also allege “Person 1” engaged in a year-long bitcoin laundering scheme that spanned over 40,000 trades and seven different cryptos, and in a two-week spree generated $540,000 in profit from the Banana.Fund pot.      “Person 1” never paid the vast majority of investors back, the prosecutors alleged.      Dutch_Giant said that a number of Banana.Fund users were well aware of the risks involved with “Jo Cook” enterprises. “Cook,” he said, had a track record of operating crowdfunded-oriented website scams that nonetheless paid some investors out.      “It was a reasonably calculated bet,” he said.",NEGATIVE,BTC | USDT,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | USDT,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/08/03/inside-a-crypto-ponzi-how-the-65m-bananafund-fraud-unravelled,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c9ee3db91731be9143f9507f8ac13561033c8668-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Huobi Group said in an announcement Monday it has launched a new business unit called Huobi DeFi Labs to manage the new fund.  DeFi Labs, which initially comprises of four staff, will focus on research, investment and incubation of DeFi-related projects.  The exchange recently hired former banker Sharlyn Wu as its chief investment officer to lead the initiative.  Previously, Wu spent three years leading the blockchain investment arm at China Merchant Bank International (CMBI), the overseas branch of one of the biggest banks in China.  During Wu's term, the CMBI invested in several crypto and blockchain firms, including wallet startup Bitpie and public blockchain project Nervos.  ""It is exciting to see the power of the permissionless economy unleashed at global scale,"" Wu said. ""However, there are still many problems to be solved at the theoretical and technical levels.""  The new fund comes at a time crypto VCs are upping their investments in DeFi-related protocols.

42384300,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAPHcv,1596438000,Where FATF Crypto Compliance Gets Interesting: Africa,"Africa isn’t included on the virtual asset regulatory map just yet.      But crypto businesses seeing strong growth across the 54-country continent are working hard on know-your-customer (KYC) rules to meet the exacting standards set out by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).      A broad range of entities operating in Africa, ranging from crypto exchanges to remittance providers to peer-to-peer marketplaces, are exploring KYC options, which could mean picking up licenses from other jurisdictions or even creating new regulatory frameworks in some cases.      The FATF makes reference to jurisdictions with “weak or non-existent” anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) controls in its recently published summer plenary report.      Read more: FATF Plans to Strengthen Global Supervisory Framework for Crypto Exchanges      If a so-called stablecoin provider were located in a jurisdiction with poor AML/CTF controls, other jurisdictions could apply their stronger AML/CTF laws to these providers, says the FATF report.      But enforcement of any rules might be difficult if the home supervisor of the virtual asset services provider (VASP) had not implemented the revised FATF standards strongly enough to respond to international co-operation requests, the report continues.      Nonetheless, innovative crypto players in Africa and other parts of the unregulated world are doing their best to be AML-compliant with a view toward meeting the requirements of the Travel Rule. The Travel Rule mandates that the senders and receivers of crypto transactions over $1,000 on regulated exchanges must be identified.    Shopping for regs    “In places where there aren’t really e-regulatory rules yet, firms are doing KYC and using blockchain analytics for AML,” said former Kenya resident Pelle Braendgaard, CEO of crypto identity startup Notabene. “People are shopping around for regulation, looking at remittance licenses to deal with foreign partners so they can have at least some level of clarity.”      This was the approach taken by BitPesa, launched in Kenya in 2013. The cryptocurrency payments and liquidity platform, which rebranded as AZA last year, snagged a license from the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in 2015, then acquired money transfer company TransferZero in 2018, gaining a license from the Spanish central bank.      Read more: Identity Startup Notabene Launches Exchange Tool for FATF Travel Rule Compliance      When AZA expanded into Nigeria, it helped the Nigerian central bank address the dearth of crypto regulation, taking part in a government DLT task force, said Stephany Zoo, AZA’s head of marketing.      “Our AML and KYC are of U.K. and European standards, which means we are asking for things that nobody else on the African continent is asking for,” said Zoo, adding:    “We have a number of automated AML and KYC platforms that are integrated into ours, but when you don't have the same kind of access to government databases, it becomes much harder to run these checks. So, unfortunately, we do have to use a combination of automated and manual systems.”    AZA also recently became the first company to get a digital remittances license in Uganda, which involved some hands-on effort.      Read more: Why Binance and Akon Are Betting on Africa for Crypto Adoption      “We basically lobbied the central bank for three years and finally they created a license for us,” Zoo said. “In Africa, that’s what you kind of have to do, you have to work with the government very closely because these regulations don’t exist, so you have to create them.”      Collecting remittance licenses is one approach; formulating an entire regulatory framework is another. That’s what Cryptobaraza CEO Michael Kimani is attempting to do with the Blockchain Association of Kenya.      Kimani counts South African crypto exchange Luno among the association’s backers, and says members would like to move the regulatory process forward on their own steam, rather than wait for state-led supervision to emerge.      He also expects guidance on this project from the likes of FATF and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).      “We are creating our own virtual currency guidelines and we are hoping to submit about 15 regulations,” said Kimani. “One of the reasons I’m trying to push this, as the chairman of the association, is because I feel it’s important we cater to local peculiarities and don’t just end up adopting some laws that may have been customized for a completely different market.”      Africa is a complex and varied market. Its many local nuances mean Western companies can experience epic failures, such as BebaPay, Google’s bank-backed attempt at travel cards.      Even M-Pesa, the Vodafone-backed mobile-phone money with a monopoly in Kenya, failed miserably in South Africa, where some 75% of the population have bank accounts.      There’s also a lesson here for Facebook and the proposed cryptocurrency libra, says Kimani: “I think the challenge is, no one wants to see a foreign company come in here and just dominate the payments scene.”      Read more: Vodafone Is the Latest Big Company to Quit Facebook-Founded Libra Association    P2P pump    African countries with more advanced banking and financial infrastructure such as Nigeria are beginning to see impressive growth in crypto, not only in remittances but around investing and trading, said Ruth Iselema, CEO and co-founder of crypto exchange Bitmama.      “There’s not much in the way of government rules,” said Iselema, “but we can KYC users with Nigeria’s BVN [bank verification number]. It’s like a social security number, but not everyone has one. Or you can use an international passport when you have higher transaction limits.”      But exchange-based trading in Africa is only part of the picture, as Cryptobaraza’s Kimani points out. Peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplaces are growing fast across the continent. This type of crypto adoption between so-called “unhosted wallets” occupies the other end of the regulatory spectrum from the FATF’s VASP regime.      “The best way to mitigate the ML/TF [money laundering/terrorist financing] risks posed by such disintermediated transactions remains an area of focus and will be considered in further detail by the FATF as part of its ongoing work on virtual assets,” states the FATF plenary report.      Read more: Binance-Backed Crypto Payments App Launches as Race for Africa Heats Up      There are, in fact, two types of P2P markets in Africa, said Kimani. The first includes the likes of LocalBitcoins and Paxful. But there’s another whole system of informal networks based on trust and reputation. Pockets of trading using Telegram and WhatsApp are also very popular, said Kimani, who has acted as an escrow agent to such trust networks.      “This happened before crypto with PayPal, Skrill and Neteller,” said Kimani. “People feel comfortable knowing they are dealing with someone they trust. A lot of crypto conversations are fixated on AML, but I think crypto could learn a lot from how these trust networks operate.”    The Paxful challenge    Meanwhile, P2P marketplace Paxful, which is now experiencing explosive growth in Africa, has taken on an inordinate KYC challenge across the region.      (Learn more about LocalBitcoins and Paxful activity worldwide using CoinDesk’s interactive map.)      Paxful CEO Ray Youssef explained his company is building a localized KYC “switchboard,” in rather the same way Paxful itself has evolved into a universal switchboard for money.      “It’s a big job, believe me; it’s like a whole other startup,” said Youssef. “For example, Nigeria has five different types of national ID, most of them don’t have an expiry date. In Kenya, there’s no such thing as proof of address. If someone has an ID from a little country like Malawi, for example, we are routing KYC requests to one of the very few appropriate KYC providers. Sadly, most KYC providers have left Africa behind.”      A large slice of Paxful’s business in places like Nigeria involves the trading of gift cards (Amazon, Apple, etc.) for bitcoin. These gift cards are sold for bitcoin at between 60 cents and 80 cents on the dollar, which critics flag up as inherently scammy.      Some of the business is fraudulent, as Paxful will admit.      “We have made 99.5% of gift card transactions safe, which is a monumental achievement,” said Youssef. “LocalBitcoins dropped gift cards because they don’t have the capability to support this. But we haven’t abandoned gift cards, and they are most challenging. Why? Because they are a key route to onboarding the emerging world.”      Read more: Charlie Shrem TLDL: Ray Youssef and Crypto’s Role in Africa      There appears to be a vibrant system of gift card remittance (many gift cards are purchased by expat Nigerians in the U.S., who immediately send pictures of the cards, plus receipts back to relatives who then trade for bitcoin). Indeed, gift cards are even described as a kind of “stablecoin” to the Paxful ecosystem; this is not so different from the hack where Kenyans started selling mobile-phone minutes, which ultimately led to M-Pesa.      Youssef said gift card trading, plus the creation of a bitcoin trade route between Nigeria and China, have paved the way for a crypto gold rush in Africa. He also thinks P2P is going to be front and center.      “P2P is how the world works,” said Youssef. “Dare I say it – and I do – in two years time, P2P volume will flippen exchange volume, which is vastly inflated. They’ve got some surprises coming from the people of Africa.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/08/03/where-fatf-crypto-compliance-gets-interesting-africa,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fcf6bab602b83fdf1b4802a42884daf4da478f0f-1500x1127.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
