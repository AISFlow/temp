42425543,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIUBFh,1393975671,"Overstock Tops $1 Million in Bitcoin Sales, Projects Up to $20 Million By Year's End","It has been less than two months since e-commerce giant Overstock.com began accepting bitcoin payments on their website, and the online retailer has already surpassed $1m in total sales.  Overstock's CEO Patrick Byrne confirmed the company's plans to embrace bitcoin back in December, and bitcoin payment processing officially went live on Overstock.com on 9th January.  Byrne spoke with CoinDesk about its $1m milestone, asserting that while the initial surge of bitcoin sales did subside, there has since been steady growth in bitcoin payments:  ""In the first day there was an enormous surge of bitcoin sales, but we've also seen a gradual building of bitcoin sales in a week-by-week basis.""  The initial projections for sales processed with bitcoin on Overstock.com this year was set at $3-5m, but this figure has since increased dramatically, according to Byrne.  The CEO now predicts that Overstock will see a total of $10-15m in bitcoin sales this year, and suggested that this number could reach as high as $20m if bitcoin sales maintain their current growth rate.  New data  Overstock partnered with Coinbase to process bitcoin payments, and together the two companies have compiled and released data that shows the spending habits of bitcoin users on Overstock, notably comparing them to credit card users.  The findings show that customers who use bitcoin as a payment method spend on average $58 (34%) more on their orders than customers using credit cards.  Byrne says that Overstock has reaped the benefits of accepting bitcoin as a payment method, most notably in regards to eliminating chargeback fraud from credit card payments and reducing payment processing fees:    ""Bitcoin payments have helped us avoid fraud in the form of chargebacks with credit cards, and we're also able to get paid faster than when payments are processed with credit cards.      It takes three days for payments to finalize with credit cards, and with bitcoin we can get paid immediately.""    Market effects  While Overstock is credited as the first major online retailer to accept bitcoin payments, they're not alone when it comes to reputable companies embracing bitcoin. TigerDirect began accepting bitcoin payments in late January, and companies like Virgin Atlantic and Reddit have helped further legitimize the digital currency as a convenient and secure payment method.  Speaking on the recent news of Overstock’s $1m bitcoin sales milestone, Coinbase noted that while they’re excited about the growing number of transactions being processed with bitcoin, they’re certainly not surprised:  “We are more gratified than surprised with these recent milestones, as they illustrate our belief that we are near a tipping point for broad merchant and consumer adoption of Bitcoin.”  Byrne hopes that the news of Overstock surpassing $1m in bitcoin payments will continue to build the currency's credibility and adoption rates, noting that many customers are switching from competing commerce sites to shop with bitcoin on Overstock:    ""I've seen the bitcoin community really embrace Overstock and I've read about many cases of our customers coming over from Amazon specifically to shop using bitcoin.      I think that bitcoin payments will account for several percent of all online transactions in the next year or two, and when this happens, Amazon will be forced to start accepting bitcoin on their website.""    With the amount of sales being processed with bitcoin steadily growing on Overstock, Byrne noted that the company has recently changed its business model and will start to hold ""5-10% of [their] processed bitcoins in reserves.""  Given the option that Coinbase offers its merchants to immediately convert bitcoins to fiat currency, this move is a symbol of Overstock's confidence in the principles of bitcoin and its utility as a means for buying goods and services online.

42425535,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIUB1h,1393968231,$1 Million Up for Grabs at Texas Bitcoin Conference Hackathon,"The lucky winners of the upcoming Texas Bitcoin Conference Hackathon could walk away with up to $1m thanks to David Johnston, co-founder of BitAngels, a bitcoin-oriented angel investor group.  While it might sound like a very generous gesture on Johnston's part, he views it as a rather prudent investment instead.  The Hackathon will be held on 5th - 6th March in Austin, Texas, with the CEO taking to reddit to explain his plan in an AMA. There was no shortage of questions – after all, we are talking about a potentially life-changing sum of money.  Kickstarter-style fundraiser  Instead of simply giving the prize money away with no strings attached, Johnston wants to award it to the top four projects that emerge out of the hackathon.  He explained:  ""Specifically I expect that the winning projects will hold open Kickstarter-style fundraisers after they get a little further down the road and I'll commit to contributing at least $250,000 to each of their Kickstarter efforts.""  Speaking of strings attached, Johnston clearly states that all projects must be open source, have their own token, use a decentralized block chain (preferably the Bitcoin block chain) and feature a consensus mechanism. Full details are available via the official hackathon page.  Johnston points out that he accumulated his wealth by working ""100-hour weeks for 10 years"" and by investing in bitcoin in the good-old days. He argues that bitcoin has pioneered a new model for developing technology, as outlined in his decentralized applications whitepaper.  What is Johnston looking for?  Johnston says he is interested in projects that use the bitcoin model of a decentralized application, but that don't compete with the features of bitcoin. He is not interested in altcoins and alternative block chains.  ""Let me give an example of what I am interested in. If you came to me with a project and said: 'It's basically Dropbox, but people can pay in bitcoins,' I would have no interest because one day soon Dropbox will start taking BTC and your advantage disappears.""  ""If you came to me with a project and said: 'This protocol pays people Storage Coins to contribute their extra hard drive space to the cloud and we have a cool Proof of Storage mechanism and its all open source and we store the records in the Bitcoin block chain,' then I'd be highly interested,"" he explains.  Johnston points out that it's all about the difference between simply accepting bitcoins and building something new using bitcoin technology.  He says he expects a billion people to be using bitcoin in the next five years, but he adds that most of them simply won't know it anymore than billions of people that use HTTP on a daily basis do.  Judging by the AMA, Johnston isn't your run-of-the-mill angel investor: he comes across as a real enthusiast committed to the development of bitcoin.  He says he is looking forward to the launch of the Master Protocol Distributed Exchange, watching developments at Bitshares, writing an analysis of Ethereum for BitAngels, talking to the Dark Wallet team and just keeping track of digital currency developments as they happen.",POSITIVE,BTC,ALTCOIN | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/04/1-million-up-for-grabs-at-texas-bitcoin-conference-hackathon,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/de52e12dc65b0cabf84c3e5bec71f522bb36abd7-1024x743.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425547,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIUBPh,1393956741,London's First Bitcoin ATM Launches in Trendy Shoreditch Bar,"In just a few weeks, the options have doubled for people in London who want to buy their bitcoin instantly with cash, rather than via an online transaction and all the proof of ID/bank payment rigmarole that entails.  If you hadn’t guessed, those options have gone from just one to two, but the speed at which they have appeared is a sign that bitcoin is increasingly being seen as a viable business option in the UK.  First to provide a walk-in service for bitcoin purchases was Azteco, London’s very first BTC voucher shop, which opened on 17th February in the east of the capital.  And now, less than a mile away, London’s very first bitcoin ATM machine has begun pinging digital currency to customers’ wallets at the trendy Old Shoreditch Station cafe.  Arts and coins  The cafe – as well as exhibitions, events and a shop – is operated by Jaguar Shoes, an arts collective that has been accepting bitcoin payments for its products since July last year.  The Lamassu Bitcoin ATM takes their bitcoin operations to a new level, and is owned and run by Future Coins, a London-based startup. Joel Raziel, entrepreneur and director of Future Coins told CoinDesk:  “I was intrigued when I first saw a bitcoin ATM on display at a conference and was shocked to find that none had appeared in London. I contacted the manufacture, Lammasu, who told me that they had not received any orders from the UK. It was at this point that I started to cost up the project and move forwards.”  Setting up shop  The decision by the UK tax authority, HMRC, to classify bitcoins as VAT exempt was announced on the day Future Coins installed the ATM.  “This couldn't have come at a better time, said Raziel. “We could have faced major difficulties otherwise, so I suppose we took quite a risk in this sense.”  There is a limit of £1,000 for transactions at the ATM and no ID is required, unlike some ATMs in other countries.  Future Coins does not use an exchange partner at present, but the ATM manufacturer will be rolling out this option soon, Raziel said. “For the time being we are having to preload the machine with coins, which puts us at risk of currency fluctuations.”  Because of this, he adds, it will cost you an 8% commission to use the ATM currently.  “We will lower this once we have linked the ATM to an exchange, but in the mean time we have to protect ourselves from fluctuations.”  So novel is the bitcoin ATM in the UK, that its second customer travelled over 200 miles to use it. “We were so honoured to have him with us,” Raziel said, “we treated him to lunch (paid for with bitcoin).”  Rivals’ arrival  Future Coins may have won the title of ‘first bitcoin ATM in London’, but it will probably not have the playing field to itself for long.  Other companies have plans for similar ATMs in the capital including Global Bitcoin ATM Ltd and Satoshipoint Ltd.  Both companies have machines on order and had hoped to be the first to set up their trading business on London turf.  First or not, the city is a very big place and there is plenty of room for more ATM outlets to provide visitors and locals alike easy access to the advantages that bitcoin brings.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/04/londons-first-bitcoin-atm-launches-in-trendy-shoreditch-bar,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/99093d0e4021281bf3807397d1150c9c137ae83b-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42374531,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvlGu5,1393952403,ZeroBlock Acquires Real-Time Bitcoin Trading Platform RTBTC,"ZeroBlock, the bitcoin mobile app specialist acquired by Blockchain.info last December, has purchased real-time bitcoin trading platform and market visualization provider RTBTC.  Notably, the acquisition is part of a larger play by Blockchain to attract institutional investors to its ZeroBlock property.  RTBTC will power ZeroBlock’s new trading platform, and ZeroBlock’s proprietary news feed will be embedded in the new trading platform, allowing traders first access to market­-moving news.  📷  Dan Held, co­-founder of ZeroBlock and director of product for Blockchain, told CoinDesk that the move had obvious advantages for both properties as well as consumers.  ""ZeroBlock is the only trading platform that has an aggregated news feed. News moves markets, and our platform will empower traders to react faster to relevant breaking information.""  RTBTC has facilitated more than $150m in trading volume across multiple exchanges since its launch last July, and works by allowing traders to link their exchange accounts to the platform using its API.  The platform boasts advanced features usually reserved for professional-level platforms used for traditional markets.  As part of the purchase, RTBTC lead developer Clark Moody will join the Blockchain team. The terms of the bitcoin-only deal were not disclosed.  — ZeroBlock (@zeroblock) March 4, 2014  Product overview  ZeroBlock indicated that the company's existing news feed services would remain free, but that features made possible by the deal will be part of a new professional version of ZeroBlock.  Held elaborated on the pricing and availability details, stating:  ""RTBTC will be integrated into ZeroBlock under the new ZeroBlock trading platform, which will be open for trading Tuesday. The subscription costs $20/month for unlimited trading.""  The paid version of ZeroBlock will allow traders to access a mobile app called ZeroBlock Pro, which hopes to enable mobile trading on Android and iOS apps, an interesting choice given that Apple has been notoriously strict in its policies regarding bitcoin apps. For example, the Blockchain wallet app was removed from Apple's app stores in February.  Still, Held said he is optimistic that Apple will host the platform.  ""Apple currently allows apps for trading like E-Trade and Oanda, which operate in traditional markets. Apple's only worry with digital currency is that it will circumvent their in app purchase system. Bitcoin trading doesn't directly allow the users to send/receive bitcoin.""     More to come  In the official release, ZeroBlock was enthusiastic about adding Clark to the team, lauding his development of the RTBTC platform. Further, CEO Nicolas Cary praised Moody, calling him a pioneer and visionary in the bitcoin economy.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Held talked further about Clark's involvement with ZeroBlock, and what customers can expect from the partnership.  ""Clark has incredible insight and technical understanding of the Bitcoin markets and is probably the most knowledgeable individual I know regarding cryptocurrency trading. Clark and I will sculpt the future of Bitcoin trading, taking it from a retail level to a professional one.""  Held said he is eager to develop his working relationship with Clark, but did not disclose additional details about any planned products.  The official release did however offer a teaser, promising ""exciting new features are coming"" to the trading platform, including support for additional exchanges.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/04/zeroblock-acquires-real-time-bitcoin-trading-platform-rtbtc,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0476f1bf848375df4ffcafd141b466c6bab2b9e2-1696x1006.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425540,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIUB9h,1393949220,Bitcoin Bank Flexcoin to Close After $600k Bitcoin Theft,"Alberta-based bitcoin storage specialist Flexcoin has announced that it will shut down following an attack and subsequent robbery that saw cybercriminals abscond with 896 BTC (roughly $600,000 at press time) stored in the company's hot wallets.  Flexcoin, which styled itself as the ""first bitcoin bank"", though it was not legally such an entity, took to its homepage to announce the theft and closure.  The statement reads:  ""As Flexcoin does not have the resources, assets or otherwise to come back from this loss, we are closing our doors immediately.""  Flexcoin also provided the wallet addresses of the alleged hackers. The largest wallet of which received 592.1 BTC from the breach, while the smaller of the two held at one point 304 BTC supposedly taken from the website.  The entirety of the two accounts have since been withdrawn in other transactions. Neither wallet seems to have any recorded transactions prior to 2nd March.    Flexcoin will be shutting its doors. http://t.co/SoigZa3WtS      — flexcoin (@flexcoin) March 4, 2014        Remaining funds  Following the announcement of the closure, customers who held bitcoins in Flexcoin's cold storage accounts were assured that they would be able to retrieve the funds. Individuals who contact Flexcoin will be asked to provide identification, and will have their coins transferred from the bank free of charge.  The company had last week posted a tweet regarding the safety of their bitcoin storage practices.    We hold zero coins in other companies, exchanges etc. While the MtGox closure is unfortunate, we at Flexcoin have not lost anything.      — flexcoin (@flexcoin) February 25, 2014    Notably, the wording provided indicated that the attack differed from the Mt. Gox assault, which alleged its cold storage was ""wiped out due to a leak in the hot wallet”.  About Flexcoin  Flexcoin aimed to differentiate itself from other electronic wallet providers by incentivizing users for keeping their bitcoin balances on the site.  The company monetized by charging employees 0.02 BTC or 1% of transaction amounts for funds transferred out of cold storage, and 0.01 BTC or one half of 1% for funds transferred to cold storage.  Flexcoin to bitcoin transactions were also subject to charges.  The announcement confirms fears that many in the bitcoin community have long harbored toward Flexcoin and other bitcoin wallet storage services.  As early as two years ago, Flexcoin was singled out as a service that many argued would not be able to protect consumer investments due to limitations in its design.

42425532,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIUAvh,1393945204,Tinkercoin Will Sell You $20 in Bitcoin - But Only Once,"UPDATE (19th September 2014 14:39 BST):  The team behind Tinkercoin has suspended this service and moved on to other bitcoin projects.      A Canadian company is selling bitcoins via credit card – but it'll only sell you $20-worth, and it'll only do it once.  Founded back in February 2012, Ontario-based Tinkercoin has only opened its service today. Initially serving North America, it is focusing on the market for new bitcoin users who don't have any idea how to set themselves up with the new currency.  Co-founder Gareth MacLeod explains that the team kept encountering friends who had heard about the digital currency, but were put off by traditional exchanges with their know-your-client rules. He said:  ""It's designed for someone who has heard of bitcoin and it's in their head, but they never took the plunge. Or maybe they did, but then [incumbent Canadian bitcoin exchange] Virtex asked them for a utility bill.""  Instead, the developers decided to create a near-zero effort service for users. They provide a credit card number, sign up for an account, and nominate a wallet.  Tinkercoin lets users nominate their own wallet, but also offers to set up a Coinbase one for them. They make a payment, and their coins drop into the wallet. Tinkercoin only sells $20 of bitcoins, and it will only make one sale per customer.  No regulatory worries  ""It's my job to keep tabs on [the] regulatory environment. There's almost no future in which selling $20 of bitcoins to someone will label you as any kind of significant money transfer businesses,"" said MacLeod, explaining how he expects to fly under the regulators' radar in both the US and Canada with his service.  Money transmission licenses  simply don't cover firms dealing at his level, he suggests. ""In the US, it starts at $1,000 per person per day. We sell $20 to one person, ever."" Once a person has bought their $20 of bitcoins, they'll have to go elsewhere.  For this reason, he is equally unflustered by recent comments from Canadian finance minister Jim Flaherty about his plans to regulate bitcoin in Tinkercoin's home country.  This seems to go against most online business models, which focus on customer retention rather than customer acquisition, which is often a high-cost activity. But there is no shortage of willing users, argues MacLeod.  ""I have 25 friends off the top of my head who think that bitcoin is interesting but they don't know where to start. We're not worried that there's gonna be any shortage of new bitcoin users in the next five years. Bank of America said that there were 1 million total bitcoin users in North America right now, so there are still 329 million left to go. We're happy with that for now.""  The firm's fees are relatively high. Most KYC exchanges will service a customer's bitcoin-buying needs for roughly a 3% cut. Tinkercoin takes a flat $5 fee, so customers hand over $25 to get their $20 of coins.  That's a whopping 25% fee for the service, which prices itself based on Bitstamp's exchange rate. ""We view it as a flat fee for the super-easy user experience,"" he said.  However, MacLeod says that a lot of the firm's resources went on securing a credit card payment processor willing to work with a bitcoin company (more on that here). The costs of dealing with the processor are ""extraordinarily expensive"", he said, reducing his margin to around 5-6%.  [post-quote]  Tinkercoin is working with at least one credit card fraud prevention service provider to help it reduce the risk of credit card fraud, says MacLeod, who spent a short stint as a software engineer specialising in security at Facebook.  Measures include matching the country associated with a user's IP address against the issuing country of the card being used, for example.  This would be a straightforward high-volume, low-value business if all the firm was doing was chewing through new users. However, there's also another facet: customers have to sign up for an account, which means that the firm will have their email address, potentially turning the business into a large bitcoin-focused list-building operation. The service gathers your email address by requiring a connection with your Facebook account.  Brokerage service  MacLeod says that options open to Tinkercoin in the future include becoming a more fully-featured brokerage service, like BTCQuick.  That service, which also offers credit or debit card-based sales (but without the single purchase constraint), has 26,000 users. As long ago as October last year, it showed CoinDesk documents indicating that it had hit $2m in sales. BTCQuick follows anti-money laundering practices.  Tinkercoin may find it competing with ATM machines that are opening (and temporarily closing) across the country, although MacLeod says that they serve slightly different markets.  In any case, ""a rising tide raises all ships,"" he says. Another competitor could be QuickBT, another business based north of the border, which sells bitcoin via Interac, Canada's online payments network. The service, built largely on Python and hosted on Heroku, launched today.

42425550,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIUBTh,1393941926,Bitcoin vs Argentine Peso: Which is Worse Off?,"Global financial instability was a key catalyst for the inception of bitcoin and, following the 2008 crisis, people’s trust in the banks' ability to support their needs was badly shaken.  Even the genesis block of bitcoin included a time-stamped article about financial instability – a nod, perhaps, towards the reason for the creation of the digital currency in the first place:  “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks”  The legacy of this time is still having a strong effect on global markets and the past year has been a worrying one for emerging nations.  Several factors have been attributed to the fall in some developing countries’ currency values relative to the dollar.  One is the effect of the US Federal Reserve tapering its bond purchases. Some claim it has to do with China’s questionable growth numbers.  Either way, the fact remains that many emerging currencies have been on a downward slide.  All of the countries in the chart above have seen a drop in the value of their national currency relative to the dollar.  None stands out, however, more than Argentina, which devalued its peso in January in order to to retain its international reserves.  Bitcoin an alternative?  Bitcoin investor Chamath Palihapitiya is a big believer in the digital currency. He said the following about the devaluations occurring in some countries:    Argentina, Venezuela and India are dealing with a deval of their currency. Bitcoin activity has seen a meaningful uptick in each country.      — Chamath Palihapitiya (@chamath) January 27, 2014    Given how bitcoin has reacted to the failure of one its oldest and most popular exchanges, Mt. Gox, with a significant rebound only days after the company’s final death throes, it seems that the cryptocurrency is irrepressible.  Mt. Gox’s failure has resulted in the loss of around 6% of the bitcoin in circulation. CEO Mark Karlpeles admitted that the exchange was robbed or has lost hundreds of thousands of BTC. He told a press conference:  “There was some weakness in the system, and the bitcoins have disappeared. I apologize for causing trouble.”  All that, however, has not caused the bitcoin crisis that many predicted.  Self harm or sensible policy?  In the wake of its devaluation, Argentina has enacted other financial controls. President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner has put in place over 30 restrictions to stave off capital flight, but this is effectively restricting how the South American nation’s citizens can move their money around.  Before its total collapse, Mt. Gox long had issues processing USD withdrawals. This problematic lack of ability to move capital is a lot like what Argentina was already doing – as policy.  The problem is, the Argentine government controls an entire currency, whereas, fortunately, Mt. Gox never could never have had that much control over bitcoin.  Argentina’s Economy Minister Axel Kicillof recently admitted to the media that:  “Culturally, in the Argentine mentality there is a desire to own dollars. Sure, there’s a desire to own it – there is stability to the US dollar that the peso simply does not have.”  “The US dollar is the measuring stick by which people seem to value bitcoins, so the link between the local bitcoin price and devaluation is clear – bitcoins are worth their weight in dollars,” says Mugur Marculescu, a co-founder of BitPagos – a startup that helps Argentine companies convert credit card payments into bitcoin for better stability.  BitPagos prefers to use bitcoin over the Argentine peso because no government can directly affect it, and it is providing its service for others who feel the same way.  Devaluations of the peso have cause Argentina some serious economic repercussions. For example, it has allowed neighbouring Columbia to overtake it in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures, when previously it had been far out in front.  Ups and downs  Many in Argentina hold on to USD dollars as a way to avoid the possibility of the peso becoming worthless. Such volatility creates serious uncertainty, as investors never have the security of knowing where the exchange rate is going to go next.  So the problematic currency devaluations in Argentina are likely to keep people looking for alternatives, including bitcoin.  Of course, cryptocurrencies are volatile too – and there's still no sure bet as to when or if they will stabilize – but, the swings in bitcoin (even in the face of a major exchange implosion) are less volatile than ever before.  Investors never want to see the value of their money to go down – even if it goes down, then back up again. However, many in Argentina have more faith in bitcoin’s performance than in their own national currency.  Although bitcoin can be volatile, cannot be devalued deliberately by a central authority, especially one with an irresponsible urge to spend when money is tight.  It will be interesting to see what Argentina will do with the regulation of cryptocurrencies as a result of the nation’s growing interest in bitcoin.  “Argentina has not yet taken any regulatory stance,” said Marculescu. However, he added:  “During the Latin American bitcoin conference this past December, representatives from the Argentine Central Bank were in attendance. We expect to hear more regarding regulation in Argentina in the near future”.  Removing the veil  Many Argentinians no longer have faith in the government to administer its financial system. Instead, they look to the dollar – and perhaps bitcoin – as a better alternative.  Most Argentinian citizens are not unbanked, but feel the tradition monetary system has only ever provided them with illusions of banking security. Now, it appears they have seen through that illusion, and are looking elsewhere for the real thing.  In comparison, bitcoin’s decentralized economy continues to improve. Many are optimistic that its early wobbles will soon stabilize to reveal a stronger structure than ever before.

42374546,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvlHCx,1393935231,The Non-Expert’s Guide to the Mt. Gox Fiasco,"After being bombarded with questions about Mt. Gox, bitcoin blogger Arianna Simpson decided to explain ""all this hot wallet cold storage transaction malleability business"" in layman's terms, once and for all. Read on to get the lowdown on the bitcoin story of the moment.  First, a bit of context:  Created in 2010, Mt. Gox is (was?) based in Japan and led by CEO Mark Karpeles. It started out as one of the earliest and most respected bitcoin exchanges, and quickly grew to be the largest. Since then, it has lost a significant degree of trust.  Mt. Gox has had issues with withdraws, crashes etc in the past, and most recently declared that transaction malleability, “a bug in bitcoin”, was forcing them to suspend withdrawals. Then, in a further twist, Mt. Gox bottomed out with the news that it appears to have lost over seven hundred thousand bitcoins, most of which were customer funds.  Mt. Gox closed for trading, and it is unclear if and when it will ever reopen. A crisis strategy document attributed the bitcoins’ disappearance from their location in cold storage to a leak in the hot wallet.  What’s transaction malleability?  Whenever a bitcoin transaction occurs, it is recorded in the public ledger, which is a list of all bitcoin transactions that have ever taken place.  Each of these is identified by a transaction ID (TXID). At a high level, transaction malleability describes the fact that signed transactions can be altered slightly in ways that end up changing the TXID, without invalidating the signature.  The bitcoin community has known about this since 2011, and there are legitimate reasons for which transactions could need to be modified, so it’s not necessarily a problem. Where it did become a problem, however, was where Mt. Gox was using TXIDs (which, to reiterate, are known to be modifiable) as the definitive way to track transactions.  Rather, transaction IDs were designed as an easy reference for support services. “[Processors] will issue this transaction ID, and if you have an issue with the transaction, you can call the support desk and tell them if the transaction didn’t arrive.”  The support desk at Mt. Gox repeatedly reissued disbursements to customers who reported that they hadn’t received funds from transactions linked to a modified TXID.  Mt. Gox had no way of verifying the transactions, and the fact that they issued the disbursements regardless apparently resulted in Mt. Gox’s internal records becoming more and more divergent from the public record of transactions.  What are hot wallets and cold storage?  In order to spend bitcoins, you need access to both a public and private key. The public key is your address, where you can receive bitcoin, and the private key is something like a password that allows you to spend the bitcoins.  The practice of storing bitcoin offline, not on the web server or on any computer, is known as keeping them in cold storage. This is exactly what it sounds like – printing your private keys and storing them in a physical wallet, much as you would do with cash.  It is done in the interest of safety, so that if a malicious hacker gains access to your account, they wouldn’t be able to run off with all your bitcoins.  There are various ways to keep your funds in cold storage, including paper wallets. It’s a wise idea to keep the majority of your bitcoin in cold storage, which is why (most!) bitcoin exchanges also operate this way.  The website (exchange) will hold a certain number of bitcoin in hot storage, in an online wallet, so that it can be withdrawn instantly by people who hold accounts with that exchange.  The majority of the reserve will be kept offline in cold storage. Bitcoin exchanges keep all funds, including the amount in cold storage, on hand and do not loan funds out at any time.  So, what’s the problem?  Ostensibly, in order to avoid a “run on the bank” type scenario in which distrustful customers would withdraw from Mt. Gox en masse, the exchange halted withdrawals on February 7th.  This is not a completely unexpected development. Despite retaining a large percentage of the world’s bitcoin supply in customer accounts, Mt. Gox has been losing credibility in the bitcoin ecosystem for some time.  In November of 2013, many customers were already having issues withdrawing their funds, experiencing delays of weeks or even months.  The situation continued to compound until the full stop in withdrawals, and culminated in Mt. Gox’s site going white on February 24th. They also wiped their twitter feed, and issued a statement that reads,  In light of recent news reports and the potential repercussions on MtGox’s operations and the market, a decision was taken to close all transactions for the time being in order to protect the site and our users. We will be closely monitoring the situation and will react accordingly.  Best regards,  MtGox Team  Is Mt. Gox guilty?  The simple fact that it took Mt. Gox several years to realize that they were missing 744,408 bitcoins, the equivalent of 6% of the world’s supply of bitcoin, worth 365 million dollars is mind-boggling.  In their crisis strategy document, they state that the theft went unnoticed for years. It is challenging to imagine ineptitude at such a grandiose scale, so the logical alternative is that they had been aware of the issue for a long time and voluntarily chose to hide this information from their investors and the public at large.  The document also states that “The cold storage has been wiped out due to a leak in the hot wallet.” If you’re doing it right, the cold storage should not be accessible via the hot wallet, leak or no leak. That’s the whole point of separating the two.  As Andreas M. Antonopoulos, Chief Security Officer of Blockchain.info and respected bitcoin entrepreneur and developer aptly put it, “Cold storage” does not “leak.” If Mt. Gox was truly robbed, it is genuinely an astounding case of carelessness in storing and managing funds on their part.  I have no particular evidence to indicate whether this was actually dishonesty or pure incompetence, and as such will refrain from comment here. Assuming the crisis strategy document is correct, and Karpeles and the rest of Mt. Gox is honest, the funds were stolen through an external attack, the details around which remain murky at best.  At the very least, the incident illustrates a formidable lack of attention to detail and a fundamental ignorance of the basic principles of accounting (these can be succinctly summarized as: 1. inputs must be ≥ outputs, 2. don’t lose everyone’s money).  What now?  I have deep sympathy for those who lost money through Mt. Gox. For the Bitcoin ecosystem as a whole, however, it’s likely to be a positive development.  Mt. Gox had been destabilizing the price and causing unrest in the market for some time. Evidence of this is the remarkable stability in bitcoin prices following the (at least temporary) demise of the exchange.  I hope I am not too naive about the implications; I fully expect there will be significant volatility in the coming months. I’m still bullish on the long term potential of bitcoin, however. Mt. Gox might be dead, but the network as a whole is finally free to move forward.

42425544,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIUBDh,1393933343,Polish Soccer Club to Accept Bitcoin for Tickets and Merchandise,"In a bid to boost its popularity and endorse the cryptocurrency in the process, Polish soccer club GKS Katowice has announced plans to enable bitcoin payments for tickets and club-related merchandise.  The club’s supporters can now make donations to their favourite side in the digital currency, GKS Katowice said in a statement.  ""We are open to new technologies. We want to be innovative and [...] show our fans that we have great ambitions,” said Wojciech Cygan, chief executive of GKS Katowice.  Under the plan, the fans will be able to pay in the digital currency through customized bitcoin wallets.  First soccer club to endorse bitcoin  Maciej Ziółkowski, an expert from local news site Satoshi.pl, was quoted in the statement saying that GKS Katowice is the first professional soccer club in the world to endorse the digital currency. Ziółkowski said:  ""In Poland, there are now sixty outlets [which accept payments in bitcoin]. This area is rapidly developing.""  Ziółkowski pointed to the experience of US basketball team Sacramento Kings which in January became the first NBA team to accept bitcoin for products sold online and at its home stadium.  According to Marcin Ćwikła, the club's press officer, the next step for GKS Katowice will be to sell match tickets and club-related merchandise such as squad jerseys and gadgets with the use of cryptocurrency payments.  Set up in 1964 and based in Katowice, in Poland’s Silesia region, GKS Katowice has a significant following in the country’s south-west.  The club is currently celebrating the 50th anniversary of its establishment. Some of the major achievements of GKS Katowice include three Cups of Poland in 1986, 1991 and 1993, as well as two Super Cups of Poland in 1991 and 1995.  Marketing strategy  After its rise to prominence in the early 1990s, the soccer club experienced a downfall which resulted in its relegation from the Ekstraklasa to the I Liga, the second tier of Poland’s professional soccer league.  Despite this, the club has remained highly popular both in Katowice and a number of neighbouring municipalities, and maintains a budget which matches those of some of the clubs which compete in the country’s top soccer league.  The latest move to introduce digital currency donations is one of a wide range of initiatives designed to bolster the club’s media presence and lure new supporters.  After the first half of the 2013/2014 season, GKS Katowice is currently ranked third out of the 18 clubs which play in Poland’s I Liga. This means that the club still has a chance of being promoted to the Ekstraklasa, which will accept the top two squads of the I Liga to its ranks in the next season.  GKS Katowice’s last season in the top tier of Poland’s professional soccer league ended in 2005. The supporters of the Katowice-based side can now show appreciation of their club’s efforts to return to the Ekstraklasa with donations made with the cryptocurrency.  GKS Katowice’s stadium has a seating capacity of more than 10,000. The city of Katowice is its majority shareholder, with a 52.78% stake in the Polish club.  Bitcoin in Poland  Despite the lack of official recognition of bitcoin by the Polish government, Poles trade digital currencies on local platforms.  The question of bitcoin’s legal status was addressed in a policy document signed by the country’s Deputy Minister of Finance Wojciech Kowalczyk and released in July 2013, as earlier reported.  Under the current regulatory framework, all transactions made in bitcoins are to be considered as a result of two parties agreeing contractually to use the digital currency in settling their dealings, according to the document.  According to figures obtained from Bitcoincharts, local bitcoin exchange Bitcurex.pl had, on 3rd of March, a 30-day volume of some 17,009.7 BTC and 32.79m PLN ($10.76m). Bitcoin had a weighted price of 1927.5 PLN ($632.7).

42425534,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIUAxh,1393930832,Japan Mulls Bitcoin Tax Following Mt. Gox Failure,"Japan is taking the Mt. Gox collapse seriously and is already looking into measures to address the digital currency conundrum – one of which is to levy taxes on bitcoin transactions.  According to the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper, Japan’s ministry of finance and the national tax agency are studying “possible rules” that could govern digital currency transactions.  It appears that Japanese authorities think purchases made with digital currencies could be subject to existing consumption and corporate taxes.  Even though bitcoin is not recognized as an official currency according to the law, it can still be used to make purchases and this means it can be taxed, the newspaper said. But bitcoin's anonymity made it difficult for Japan's tax office to track and calculate what transactions were being made.  As AFP points out, the Yomiuri Shimbun does not cite any sources in its report. The newspaper does say, though, that Japan and many other countries simply lack the regulatory framework to levy taxes on bitcoin transactions.  Catching up  Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso confirmed on Tuesday that the country is still trying to understand what led to the Mt. Gox collapse and whether criminal activity was involved.  According to Reuters, Aso told reporters that authorities still do not have a “clear grasp of the situation”. He added:  “(We) don’t know if it was a crime or just a bankruptcy.”  However, Aso stopped short of commenting on possible regulation or taxes.  Regulation inevitable?  Although Aso did not say anything that would confirm the Yomiuri Shimbun report, it should be noted that he has made some interesting statements in the past.  Following the Mt. Gox collapse, Aso said he had been “thinking it would collapse sometime”, adding that Japan is very advanced in the field of digital currencies.  “I was thinking that we might face a situation where Japan has to act, but I’d say it came earlier than I thought,” he said.  In essence, it seems as if Japan was going to act with or without the Mt. Gox collapse – the embarrassing failure and bankruptcy of the Tokyo-based exchange will simply shift things into a higher gear.  The big question is how Japan plans to go about it. As the Yomiuri Shimbun points out, authorities are looking into ""consumption and corporate taxes,"" which is puzzling in itself. If bitcoin is treated as a commodity, even simple transactions could be taxed, much like the sale or resale of everyday goods.  If bitcoin was treated as a currency, this would be a non-issue. However, as Japan does not consider bitcoin a currency, it needs to find an alternative way of taxing bitcoin transactions - that is the crux of the problem. Corporate taxes would not apply to consumers.  International effort needed  However, Japan cannot regulate bitcoin on its own. Just last week the country’s Senior Vice Finance Minister Jiro Aichi said international collaboration would be necessary if a viable regulatory framework was to be introduced.  Aichi suggested that international coordination is necessary to prevent criminals from exploiting loopholes. National regulators cannot do it on their own, because the framework has to be harmonized.  Aichi went on to stress that Japan does not consider bitcoin a currency, which is another problem legislators need to address in order to apply existing legislation to bitcoin transactions.  The Bank of Japan said it is keeping track of developments in the world of digital currencies, but so far it has not made any statements about their use.

It will become the first widely-used exchange after BTC-e to trade the world's second most popular cryptocurrency.  CEO of BTC China, Bobby Lee, announced the move this morning, saying ""users have been clamouring for this for ages"".  Digital currency watchers will also note that BTC China's CEO, Bobby Lee, is the elder brother of litecoin inventor Charles Lee. BTC China's banner for the announcement also reads ""Brothers Reunited"".  Lee acknowledged that his fraternal relationship with Charles was well known in China and elsewhere, and said this was the main reason people asked him about integrating litecoin.  ""My brother has been a big advocate,"" Lee said. ""We really hope to spark the market for litecoin trading in China. So for those people who know, that phrase is a play on words, because in some sense, litecoin is also bitcoin's younger sibling when it comes to cryptocurrency. Dual meanings.""  ""When we did a user survey back in November last year, litecoin trading was the most highly requested feature, the number one request,"" Lee said.  Litecoin  Charles Lee added the following comments:    ""I am very excited about BTC China adding Litecoin trading to their site. BTC China's decision to support Litecoin reinforces the fact that Litecoin is the most popular alternative to Bitcoin and Bitcoin/Litecoin is the 1-2 punch of crypto-currency.""      ""As we have seen with the recent MtGox disaster, a competent and trusted exchange is very important for the health of a crypto-currency like Bitcoin and Litecoin. BTC China is a venture-backed company with a history of secure and safe practices. Unlike a lot of other crypto companies, BTC China is run by competent and non-anonymous individuals. I know because my brother, Bobby Lee, is the CEO of BTC China.""    ""Bobby has also committed to me a matching challenge donation of 1000 LTC to the Litecoin development fund. It shows that BTC China believes in the future of Litecoin and wants to support the development and health of Litecoin. BTC China also recognizes that what's good for Litecoin is also good for Bitcoin as we contribute substantive bug fixes to Bitcoin and our ability to experiment faster helps advance the state of the art of crypto-currency.""    BTC China joins a myriad of recent announcements of Litecoin support from exchanges, payment processors, and merchants.  ""The future of Litecoin is as bright as it has ever been. I am extremely excited,"" Lee said.  Reputation  Lee also stressed BTC China's reputation as a major selling point. He added:  ""People would prefer to trade litecoin on a reputable exchange. We're the most stable, the most powerful and largest exchange in China and people can trade with complete confidence.""  The recent Mt. Gox fiasco proved that trust in digital currency exchanges was important and probably needed to be rebuilt.  ""It's a sober reminder that even if BTC is decentralized, if an exchange has questionable management then there's a failure point,"" Lee continued.  ""BTC China is a well-run company, it has great backing from venture capitalists, and we're a long-term player in the market.""  Litecoin currently trades for around 0.0222 BTC on BTC-e, or $14.64. Its market cap is around $387m. During bitcoin's bull run at the end of 2013 it went as high as $45.

42397373,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb4AX6,1393901172,Bitcoin Foundation Sets Record Straight on New UK Office,"Though many in the bitcoin community were eager to distance the industry from the spectre of Mt. Gox heading into March, the failure of what was once a leading player in the market has lead high levels of uncertainty to remain.  As evidence, despite Sunday's news that the UK would formally exempt its bitcoin traders from a 20% tax, what attracted the most attention from reports was not the progressive move by the local government.  Rather, the focal point for many was a statement related to the Bitcoin Foundation's opening of a new UK office.  The controversy centered around comments from Bitcoin Foundation executive director Jon Matonis featured by The Financial Times, which suggested the organisation would redomicile from the US to the UK this spring. While a seemingly small detail, this was news many members said they were hearing for the first time.  Jinyoung Lee Englund, the organisation's director of public affairs, told CoinDesk, however, that the news was not new, and that despite some confusion, this doesn't represent any changes in the foundation's plans.    ""Bitcoin is a global protocol and to better represent our international community, we made the decision to open a UK office last December.""            In fact, the news was first reported on 12th December, though the news may have been overshadowed by the tandem announcement of new international chapters in Canada and Australia.  Community reaction  News about the Bitcoin Foundation's move traveled fast on Sunday, with some members taking to the organisation's official message boards to suggest that communication between the organisation and the community may need improvement.  The result was that foundation informed community members on various platforms of the announcement, providing a link to the original press release that stated the vision for its new office as well as how it would play a role in the organisation's long-term strategy.  Global focus requires London office  Statements from the Bitcoin Foundation indicate that the new office is meant to be a sign of the organisation's status as a global entity. For example, Seattle, while the best location for local resident and founder Peter Vessenes to create the organisation, may now be ill-equipped for the foundation and its increasing reach, past statements suggest.  Explained Matonis in the original release:    ""Strengthening and equipping local Bitcoin communities worldwide is at the core of the foundation's International Affiliate Program and a priority for 2014.            London is one of the most international cities in the world and the foundation will be best positioned to represent and support the inherently global Bitcoin community from there.""              The Bitcoin Foundation said at the time that it planned to keep its US office in Washington, DC to ""focus on US individual and corporate membership, public policy and public relations"". The international office in London will supervise and support new chapters.
