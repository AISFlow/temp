42399443,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbj9bN,1477263669,Identity and Aleppo Kick Off Money2020 Blockchain Discussion,"The human cost of financial exclusion was the central focus of Money2020's first blockchain panel in 2016.  Putting a focus on applications for identity, the panel session saw BanQu CEO and co-founder Ashish Francis Thomas Gadnis discuss the impact blockchain technology solutions could have on quality of life in emerging markets, in situations such as the ongoing refugee crisis in Syria.  ""Think about that family that got bombed out of Aleppo... that mother in Congo. She has land, she has a cell phone, she has an immunization record, yet she's not bankable because she doesn't have an economic identity,"" he said.  In this light, Gadnis discussed how blockchain could enable a way for the underbanked to ""collect their own data"" and leverage it to secure more equitable financial products.  Gadnis told the audience:  ""In the traditional system, their land rights, their harvest production, their market data, are in excel spreadsheets. The blockchain changes that. Now, this data is a collection of disparate data sets that the world doesn't recognize. You can't do that in a centralized pyramid.""  He further argued it remains difficult for those in the developing world to leverage their full range of assets and history to secure financial projects. Founded in 2015, Texas-based BanQu is said to have pilots in Somalia focused on blockchain use cases.  Gem  CEO Micah Winkelspecht, however, continued this argument by extending it to the enterprise. In his remarks, he focused on healthcare, a key business area for the startup that has so far raised $12m.  ""In most jurisdictions by law you own your own health data, it is not eMARS data. But in practicality, how many people take custody of their data?"" Winkelspecht asked.  Elsewhere, both panel participants agreed that blockchain is ""underrated"" by the public in terms of understanding its value in the emerging market and its use as a vehicle for financial inclusion more broadly.  As for how much value that market could have for businesses serving this market, Gadnis suggested the number could be in the millions.  ""It's a $550m opportunity people are not looking at seriously,"" he said.  One or many?  However, one of the more interesting discussion points took place when Santander InnoVentures' Pascal Bouvier, the panel's moderator, asked whether problems with identity could be solved by a single blockchain or multiple blockchains.  Here, Winkelspecht argued that it was likely to be implemented over multiple blockchains, given that identity is, in the view of the panelists, contextual. For example, he spoke about how a ""self-sovereign"" identity could then receive information from other data points, but give more control over the data to the user.  ""The number you announce should be public,"" Winkelspecht said. ""This identity is mapped to me, but I can reveal which attributes I want to share. Blockchains you can create a unique number for every transactions. It has massive implications for how we do identity.""  Elsewhere, Winkelspecht said he believes it's unlikely that any large institution (be it the United Nations or some other global body) could get all of the world's organizations to use a common technology for identity.  ""There's a lot of work going toward developing a common protocol for this, but getting people to agree on protocols is very difficult,"" he said.

42399436,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbj9XR,1477238970,Financial Inclusion Fund Leads $5 Million Investment in Bitcoin Startup Coins,"""We've been quiet for a long time, but it's not because we're not running.""  Launched in 2014, bitcoin startup Coins has focused on promoting financial inclusion in Southeast Asia. Armed with services in the Philippines and Thailand, Coins garnered early interest from major merchants while signing up more than 500,000 app users – yet, it hasn't been public about its activities since 2015.  That might soon change, however, as Coins has raised $5m in funding from an impressive array of global investors to further develop its mobile wallet and supporting services such as remittances and bill payments.  Announced today, the Series A round was led by Accion Frontier Inclusion Fund, a fund dedicated solely to startups focused on financial inclusion. The round also included participation from BeeNext, Digital Currency Group, Eric Schmidt's Innovation Endeavors, Global Brain, Pantera Capital, Rebright Partners and Wavemaker Labs.  Notably, the investment included support from two innovation labs backed by major telecom providers in the Philippines: Kickstart Ventures, a wholly owned subsidiary of Globe Telecom; and IdeaSpace Foundation, an incubator backed by First Pacific, which owns telecom providers including Smart Communications.  Reaching the underserved  It's the latter two investors that CEO Ron Hose believes offer his startup the biggest avenues for growth as it tries to reach its target of 600 million customers.  Hose told CoinDesk:  ""We've actually worked closely with them so we can facilitate payments to their mobile wallets and send money to any phone in the company. They have infrastructure locally, we help facilitate more usage of the infrastructure.""  One reason for this traction may be that, unlike many bitcoin startups (which focus on digital currency), Hose said Coins uses the blockchain as a ""transfer protocol"", or a means to the end of serving the underserved in its target markets.  Hose further explained that Coins customers don't have to carry exposure to bitcoin's volatility, since they have the option to hold funds in Philippine pesos or digital currency.  ""We're big bitcoin fans, but people who are unbanked, they can't afford volatility,"" Hose said.  In statements, participating investors like Ganesh Rengaswamy, partner at Accion Frontier Inclusion Fund manager Quona Capital, spoke broadly about how they believe digital currencies could play a role in promoting financial inclusion.  Bank collaboration  Rather than go for disruption, Hose credited Coins's growth in part to its willingness to embrace working with larger partners.  ""The reason that we've built so many partnerships is you need to work with the banks. You need to work with telcos, governments, non-profit organizations and bring everyone to the table,"" he said  So far, Hose argues this has allowed Coins to find creative ways to serve customers. For instance, he noted how his startup now enables ""cardless withdrawals"" at 450 ATMs. Rather than use a debit card, Coins users can enter an SMS code and gain access to cash.  ""They get cash out right out away. It's 24/7, it's the most convenient remittance you will find. This is rain or shine,"" Hose continued.  Elsewhere, Hose has expanded to services that might seem unconventional in more developed markets. This includes offering door-to-door cash delivery and service at local convenience store chains, which he asserts are all part of a larger strategy.  Hose concluded:  ""For us, it's not about getting press, we have a mission to reach as many customers as possible.""  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Coins.

42399431,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbj9TV,1477206064,Bank Execs Want An 'Even Playing Field' For Industry Blockchains,"Ninety percent of banking executives surveyed earlier this year by professional services firm Accenture said that their institutions are investing time and money in blockchain projects.  Just 3% said that they weren’t doing so, with the last 7% telling Accenture that they were “uncertain” about their work with the tech, according to a report published today. The firm surveyed 32 bank executives in August and September.  Yet despite the high degree of interest, the survey also casts a portrait of a banking sector that is largely in a cautious test-and-see phase. Respondents expressed concern about regulation and the need for standards to help build a network effect, while also highlighting compliance and security concerns as factors holding any significant degree of investment or product development.  At the same time, respondents expressed support for shared approaches between banks in order to create what one survey-taker called “a level playing field”.  Another bank executive told Accenture in an interview:  “The lack of a universal standard could prove deleterious. There could end up being bilateral agreements and altered processes between banks, which would severely diminish any network effect.”  Respondents indicated that that applications focused on intrabank settlements and cross-border payments were the most attractive, with 44% of survey-takers highlighting the former as the most appealing use case.  Still, the report suggests that some banks are still figuring things out.  Accenture quoted one US bank executive who said his institution remains “bewildered” amidst its own internal investigation.  “We don’t even have enough information to have an opinion,” said another executive from Canada.
