Top Losers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Filecoin FIL −13.3% Computing Polkadot DOT −11.4% Smart Contract Platform Chainlink LINK −11.0% Computing  Bitcoin and other major cryptos plunge  Down, down, bitcoin is going down. Where it stops ... that's the question.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization continued its plunge of the past two weeks on Monday as investors kept backing off speculative assets amid ongoing concerns about inflation and a possible global recession.  Bitcoin recently fell below $40,000, a more than 5.4% drop over the past 24 hours and down from highs at the end of March above $47,000. Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, was trading slightly over $3,000 – a more than 6% decline over the same period – after dropping below this threshold earlier in the day for the first time since the middle of last month. Other major altcoins fared even worse, with Terra's LUNA token, SOL and ADA all in the red by double digits. Meme coins DOGE and SHIB also were beaten down significantly. Trading was light.  Crypto market performance trailed equity markets, although those were off as well with the tech-focused Nasdaq down 2.1% and the S&P 500 off 1.6% as investors awaited the Tuesday release of the Consumer Price Index, which is widely expected to show inflation worsening in March.  In an email to CoinDesk, FxPro Senior Financial Analyst Alex Kuptsikevich highlighted an ""increasing correlation"" between crypto markets and stocks, particularly with the Nasdaq index. ""This relationship is easily explained by the fact that in both cases, investors are betting on a progressive idea and not on a stable income,"" he wrote.  Russia's invasion of neighboring Ukraine has disrupted supply chains and increased energy costs that were already spiraling prior to the conflict. On Monday, Russian forces continued to mass for an attack in the eastern region of Donbas in an attempt to link the area to the Crimean peninsula on the Black Sea. Meanwhile, France's third largest bank, Société Générale, became the latest major company to stop doing business in Russia, as European Union countries and others opposed to Russia's aggression continued to mull additional economic sanctions.  Noting the decline in bitcoin's 50-day moving average to near $42K, Kuptsikevich wrote that the crypto could see worse days ahead. ""Fixing below this level may open a direct path to the area of March lows near $38K,"" he said.  Markets  S&P 500: 4,412 -1.6%  DJIA: 34,348 -1.1%  Nasdaq: 13,411 -2.1%  Gold: $1,954 +0.4  Insights  Mark Karpeles tries to reinvent himself with UnGox  Eight years later, Mark Karpeles, the CEO of infamous failed bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox – its hack the genesis of crypto’s history of cyber thieves and epic collapses – is trying to make amends for the past.  Karpeles, who received a suspended sentence for manipulating exchange data but was acquitted on the most serious charges of embezzlement and breach of trust – an impressive feat considering Japanese courts’ 99% conviction rate – wants to build the tools to allow investors to assess the risks of crypto products. But this isn’t why he’s an unlikely figure to establish a ratings service, which he is calling UnGox.  In a speech at Tokyo's Foreign Correspondents' Club, he also came across as out of touch with current crypto trends. When Mt. Gox was at its prime there was no Vitalik Buterin or decentralized finance (DeFi). Still, he's determined.  “Why me? I went through everything that could go wrong when running an exchange,” Karpeles said during his speech. “When running Mt. Gox I did due diligence on a number of different crypto exchanges. We don’t want people to get ‘Goxed’ anymore.”  Karpeles said UnGox would not have an S&P or Moody’s business model where the issuer buys the review. Instead, it will be available for free online, with more granular data available via a monthly subscription. The era in which UnGox will launch is much different than when Karpeles exited the crypto industry. In the halcyon days of 2014, there was bitcoin (BTC) , litecoin (LTC) and a few other altcoins, and DeFi had not yet arrived.  When asked at the FCC about restarting in the crypto world in a different era, Karpeles said he can navigate the space. Running a crypto exchange would be a no-go, given his history, but he feels that with hacks and rugpulls so common, a ratings agency is what the industry needs.  So how would he approach a DeFi project to assess if it’s a scam? Well, first, he says, would be if the team is hiding behind a pseudonym or operating in plain sight. A second would be to look at the promised yield.  A yield of “50% a month. … I don’t have to look further to say it’s a scam,” he said.  Certainly, in Karpeles’ era these would have been the tell-tale signs of fraud. But in the time since, it is now somewhat normalized.  DeFi projects whose executives are represented by avatars and handles get top-tier venture capital money. It’s not necessary to be doxxed, or even have a traditional corporate structure as decentralized administrative organizations (DAO), and their tokens are perfectly fine, too. Liquidity Provider tokens and yield farming can earn 50% or more APY a month; there are hundreds of millions of dollars being yield farmed to provide liquidity for decentralized exchanges (DEX).  Karpeles is undoubtedly a quick learner, but he also seems to be stuck in a time capsule. CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap, data aggregators that didn’t exist during the Mt. Gox era, already provide a ratings service that scores exchanges from 1-10.  For the DeFi world, dozens of auditing platforms already exist and many don’t have the fatal flaw of S&P or Moody’s that allow for ratings to be suppressed. Certik has already audited over 1,800 DeFi projects and there are other similar portals out there.  While Karpeles had everything that can go wrong happen to him, these were the trials and tribulations of a different time. Having lessons learned from the fall of Mt. Gox as the anchor of your CV might not be as strong as he thinks.  He does seem to have a fan in journalist Jake Adelstein, of Tokyo Vice fame, who documented the fall of Mt. Gox and Karpeles’ struggle with Japan’s vicious prosecutor, and first wrote about Karpeles’ plans for UnGoxed.  “As human beings, we learn from our mistakes,” Adelstein, a self-described non-expert in crypto, said during the FCC event. “Nobody better to rate cryptocurrency as he’s dealt with all the problems.”  Technician's take  Bitcoin Approaches Support Zone at $37K-$40K  Bitcoin (BTC) is extending its pullback that began on March 28 after buyers failed to break above the $48,000 resistance level.  The cryptocurrency is not yet oversold, although lower support at $37,500 and $40,000 could stabilize the down move.  BTC was down as much as 7% over the past 24 hours. Countertrend signals, however, are roughly two days away from an inversion (selling exhaustion), per the DeMARK indicators.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart is approaching oversold levels, which could pause the current price drop. Still, oversold readings could persist for a few weeks, similar to what occurred earlier this year.  On the weekly chart, momentum signals are still positive. That means BTC's recovery from January lows remains intact, so long as buyers can maintain support above $37,500.  Despite short-term price rises, further upside beyond $50,000 could be challenging given negative momentum signals on the monthly chart, similar to what occurred during the 2018 crypto bear market.

42395580,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASy4PY,1649717532,Meta Starts Building a Digital Economy for Creators in Horizon Worlds,"Meta Platforms’ (FB) digital economy got rolling Monday with new tools for hawking virtual goods in the social media giant’s virtual reality game, Horizon Worlds.  A “handful” of creators will be able to sell “virtual items and effects” in their respective worlds, Meta said. Only Americans and Canadians above the age of 18 will be able to purchase those items.  Separately, Meta said it would reward creators whose virtual worlds prove especially popular among users with monthly bonus payouts. That program will not be subject to fees; the virtual items marketplace could see Meta take a cut of anywhere from 25% to 70%, according to The Verge.  The twin efforts showcase Meta’s early buildout of the infrastructure underpinning a digital economy. Yet more monetization and incentivization features are on the way, it promised.  “These types of tools are steps toward our long-term vision for the metaverse where creators can earn a living and people can purchase digital goods, services, and experiences,” a Meta blog post read.  “Clearly the ability to sell virtual goods and be able to take them with you from one world to another is going to be an important part” of the future metaverse, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a video published alongside the reveal.

The filing, submitted by the NBA for “The Association,” covers a laundry list of virtual items including “game tickets, game programs, trading cards, collectibles, memorabilia, jerseys” and even “memes relating to the field of basketball authenticated by non-fungible tokens.”  The league also appears to be in possession of two Ethereum Name Service (ENS) domains – nba.eth and theassociationnft.eth – belonging to a wallet associated with Adrienne O’Keeffe, the league’s head of gaming and digital assets.  According to public blockchain records, the nba.eth domain was transferred in December from NFT collector disco.eth to ENS core team member Brantly Millegan to O’Keeffe’s wallet, aok.eth. In March, theassociationnft.eth was transferred to the same address from a pseudonymous wallet.  In an earlier interview with CoinDesk, Millegan said the nba.eth transfer came about after the pseudonymous disco.eth heard Millegan publicly unpack the project’s policy of encouraging .eth squatters to give away or sell at cost domains related to known brands.  It’s unclear what precipitated the theassociationnft.eth transfer. Neither O’Keeffe nor the NBA responded to requests for comment by the time of publication.

42395591,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASy4bM,1649711041,"Marathon’s Thiel Says Company Not for Sale, as M&A Chatter Picks Up Among Crypto Miners","MIAMI — Marathon Digital (MARA), one of the largest publicly traded bitcoin (BTC) miners, with a market cap of about $2.5 billion, isn’t interested in a sale and its stock is undervalued at current levels, said CEO Fred Thiel.  A key theme from the Bitcoin 2022 Conference in Miami: There are lots of deals – including potential mergers and acquisitions (M&A) – to be made. One participant called the conference “a real deal center.”  With some speculation swirling around Marathon Digital as a possible target, CoinDesk caught up with company CEO Fred Thiel, who played down the chatter. “We are not interested in selling today,” Thiel said. “Especially given where the stock is, today, we're way undervalued, compared to where we were towards the end of last year.”  Read more: Bitcoin 2022 Miami: Mining Gets Its Moment Under the Sun  MARA stock has had a rough run - down 33% in 2022 and off more than 70% from an all-time high hit in November. However, Thiel expects the market to begin paying up for the shares, noting company expectations to grow mining capacity about sixfold to 23.3 exahash per second (EH/s) this year.  Potential buyers  While Thiel may not be interested in selling, Marathon is a public company, so he said he would present to the board any offer at the right price.  Potential acquirers? Perhaps an energy company with access to enough power to enable Marathon to continue its speedy growth. “It would have to be the right partner, because I view it as a partnership,” said Thiel. “And it has to be somebody who has sufficient power.”  Thiel, though, would prefer the company remain independent, allowing it to partner with any number of power companies for energy needs. In a buyout, Marathon could be limited to just one energy supplier.  “Now my growth rate is limited to what they are willing to allow me to have access to,” he argued. “So I think, from an investor's perspective, us getting acquired today doesn't make sense.”  Thiel doesn’t totally dismiss energy companies getting into the mining industry, but says they’ll enter by dipping their toes into actual mining first – perhaps after the next Bitcoin halving in 2024. Once comfortable with the industry and regulatory risks, he said, the hosting and mining acquisitions are then more likely to begin.  Read more: Bitcoin Halving, Explained  Rapid consolidation  Also speaking with CoinDesk, Bitfarms (BITF) President Geoff Morphy fully expects plenty of M&A in the cryptocurrency industry in general, and mining specifically. “It's an evolving industry,” he said. ""We're in the growth stage, and with the industry life cycle hypothesis you just know that there's going to be a consolidation that takes place. … Unlike other industries, it's going to happen at a more rapid pace [for miners] because of the halving coming up in approximately May 2024.”  Another driver of deals is bitcoin’s current bear market – which has taken the price down about 50% from its all-time high of $69,000 late last year – along with compressed miner margins. That has dried up access to capital markets for the smaller miners, said Thiel. “If bitcoin doesn't move outside of this kind of band that we're in today, it's gonna get hard. … Smaller miners are having a really hard time raising capital.” The larger players, Thiel added, continue to be able to raise money.  To that point, Riot Blockchain (RIOT) – like Marathon, one of the bigger miners – last week filed to sell up to $500 million of stock through an ""at-the-market"" offering, while Marathon raised almost $750 million in a convertible note sale in the fourth quarter. Rhodium Enterprises, on the other hand, had to postpone its initial public offering (IPO).  The potential cash crunch means opportunity for those with capital, said Bitfarms' Morphy. “A lot of companies that were looking for SPACs and IPOs to fund their growth have not taken place. As a result, there's going to be some pretty neat opportunities, we think, this year, next year and beyond,” he said, adding that he sees his company as an acquirer, not a target..  Read more: The Future of Mining Finance: Time to Get Creative  Bitfarms, he said, has seen a number of opportunities for acquisitions, but plans to be very disciplined, and will pull the trigger only if a company has the right management and power contracts. “We have hired a specialist in terms of M&A, we have brought in a special team of outside advisors to help us with this. So we're well positioned to look at growth through acquisition.”  Read more: Miners Remain Unfazed by Crypto Sell-Off, Expect More M&A  Bitfarms currently has 3 EH/s of hashrate and existing miner orders and contracted infrastructure expansion should allow a hashrate of about 7.2 EH/s by the end of 2022. That’s shy of the company target of 8.0 EH/s by year-end, but Bitfarms is looking at further development opportunities that could still help get to that level.  On the question of whether Bitfarms might be a target of an energy company, Morphy’s answer aligned with Thiel’s: “If somebody comes and makes a worthy proposal to us, I will take it to the board and it's up to the board to figure out on behalf of shareholders if this is an attractive situation for our shareholders and to proceed or not,” Morphy said.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Aoyon Ashraf,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/04/11/marathons-thiel-says-company-not-for-sale-as-ma-chatter-picks-up-among-crypto-miners,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6f41512d29c2e3148af14242564c9576524e7861-1999x1500.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Investors appear to be reducing their exposure to speculative assets, including stocks and cryptos, amid concerns about inflation and slower economic growth. Further, the 10-year Treasury yield rose to a new three-year high on Monday at 2.78%, which reduces the present value of expensively priced tech stocks.  Just launched! Sign up for Market Wrap, our daily newsletter explaining what happened today in crypto markets – and why.  Gold, a traditional safe haven, traded higher on Monday, while the Chicago Board Options Exchange's CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), a measure of the stock market's expectation of volatility based on S&P 500 index options, rose above 20, similar to what occurred in early February. That indicates uncertainty among investors.  In crypto markets, most alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) underperformed bitcoin on Monday. Ether (ETH) was down 8% over the past 24 hours, compared with a 16% drop in THORChain's RUNE token, and a 6% decline in BTC over the same period.  For now, technical indicators suggest lower support at $37,500 and $40,000 could stabilize BTC's down move.

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  No capitulation yet  Bitcoin's pullback below $43,000 triggered a wave of long liquidations over the weekend.  Liquidations occur when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position as a safety mechanism due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. In this case, traders who were long bitcoin are forced out of their positions as price drops, which can accelerate declines in the spot market.  Still, long liquidations over the past few weeks have not reached an extreme, especially compared with early March. That could point to further selling pressure until BTC experiences a more decisive down move with high trading volume, which typically indicates capitulation among short traders.  Trading volume across bitcoin spot exchanges remains low, according to CoinDesk data. Further, there was no uptick in volume over the weekend despite BTC's 7% price dip.  The chart below shows the ratio of buy volume versus sell volume in bitcoin's perpetual swaps market (30-day moving average), which is a type of crypto derivative trading product. The ratio dipped below one, suggesting dominant bearish sentiment among bitcoin traders.  Rising correlation  Despite crypto-specific events, such as The Luna Foundation Guard's (LFG) accumulation of 40,000 BTC, bitcoin has largely tracked moves in stocks over the past year.  The chart below shows a new high in the 90-day correlation between bitcoin and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index. While the correlation is still relatively low, it has remained elevated since the pandemic-induced sell-off across speculative assets in 2020.  In a Monday newsletter, FundStrat, a global advisory firm, wrote that macro uncertainty could outweigh LFG's reserve purchases. ""Following previous LFG purchases, we witnessed a rise in realized market cap as other [traders] followed LFG's lead,"" the firm wrote. ""However, realized market cap has remained flat since this latest purchase, indicating marginally less appetite for buying this weekend's dip.""  It appears that investors have tightened their risk budget, which is typical during times of market turbulence. After all, global volatility has been compressed throughout the past 15 years of unprecedented monetary stimulus.

42395586,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASy4WR,1649708932,Bitcoin Falls Below $40K for First Time Since Mid-March,"Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, fell below $40,000 on Monday for the first time since March 16.  The fall in price comes as investors weigh the risks of rising interest rates, soaring inflation and dislocation of global commerce as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  “The macro environment has investors spooked,” said Armando Aguilar, head of alternative strategies and research at Ledn.  As of press time bitcoin (BTC) was down 8.5% over the past 24 hours to $39,783.  March Consumer Price Index report (CPI Report)  U.S. President Joe Biden's administration on Monday was already warning that the Consumer Price Index report for March, due out early Tuesday, would reveal inflation rising at an ""extraordinarily elevated"" pace. That could prompt the Federal Reserve to accelerate the pace of interest-rate increases to keep inflation, currently running at a four-decade high, from spiraling out of control.  ""Rising interest rate fears and the expectation of tighter monetary conditions continues to be a focus for bitcoin investors,"" bitcoin-focused asset manager Nydig wrote in a note to investors.  The bitcoin market, which has become unusually synced lately with U.S. stocks, has been pricing in the Federal Reserve's pledge to shrink its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet by as much as $95 billion a month.  A move by the U.S. central bank to reduce its total assets would effectively reverse a key stimulus plan used in 2020 and 2021 to bolster traditional markets, the financial system and the economy; bitcoin's price quadrupled in 2020 and rose 59% last year.  Now traders are assessing the potential impact of the balance sheet reduction – referred to as ""quantitative tightening"" – along with multiple interest-rate hikes of 50 basis points (0.5 percentage point) each, according to Lucas Outumuro, head of research at IntoTheBlock. In recent economic cycles, the Fed has moved at a slower pace, with hikes of just 25 basis points.

42395589,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASy4YP,1649703135,Bitcoin Miner Crusoe Mostly Not Affected by North Dakota Oil Site Explosion,"Crusoe Energy, the bitcoin (BTC) miner that uses flared gas that would otherwise be wasted to power its miners, said Monday it was largely unaffected by an accident that occurred last week near one of its bitcoin mines in North Dakota.  Crusoe noted the incident wasn’t connected to its operations. “There was an accident unrelated to us on a location where we operate but we were relatively unaffected,” Crusoe Energy’s CEO and co-founder Chase Lochmiller told CoinDesk.  “Fortunately, nobody was hurt. Our operation was not the cause and was located far enough away from the incident that the damages to Crusoe’s facilities were minimal,” Lochmiller added.  Images of the explosion circulated on Telegram and Twitter on Monday. CoinDesk has confirmed the fire was at an oil well site in North Dakota where Crusoe operated but did not give other details.  Crusoe Energy, which recently was recognized for its “innovative” solution to generating energy by the World Bank’s Global Gas Flaring Reduction Initiative report, has several sites across the U.S., including in North Dakota, Montana, Wyoming and Colorado, where it uses wasted natural gas to power bitcoin mining rigs. Crusoe’s customers includehttps://ca.style.yahoo.com/crusoe-achieves-operational-milestones-closes-130000071.html Devon Energy (DVN), Kraken Oil & Gas, Canadian oil firm Enerplus (ERF) and others.  Notably, Crusoe is reportedly working on a pilot project with Exxon (XOM) to use flared gas at Exxon’s North Dakota oil wells to power bitcoin mining operations. And another major oil company, ConocoPhillips (COP), said it's running its own pilot project to route excess natural gas from one of its Bakken region projects in North Dakota to power bitcoin mining.  In the flaring process, excess natural gas is burned off into the atmosphere as part of oil drilling operations; it has become standard industry practice because of the lack of transportation infrastructure. The process is under environmental scrutiny, however, and U.S. President Joe Biden has pledged to cut methane emissions from oil and gas operations.  A plan to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 laid out by the International Energy Agency (IEA) would require all non-emergency flaring to be eliminated globally by 2030.  North Dakota passed a bill last year incentivizing oil and gas companies to stop flaring by providing a tax rebate for using a flare mitigation system that captures a specified percentage of gas at the site.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | MINING | REGULATION,Aoyon Ashraf,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/04/11/bitcoin-miner-crusoe-mostly-unaffected-by-north-dakota-oil-site-explosion,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f74b4c5a4fc880f360b5bae46c8163e9f64dbc5a-1500x998.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394245,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvagDl,1649702694,"Elon Musk, Twitter and Running Things Like a DAO","Even before he was the richest man in the world, Elon Musk was something of a wild card.  It’s a schtick, at this point (the stuff of Saturday Night Live sketches), but it comes from something real. Where other billionaires tend to take a long-term view of their companies, their political ambitions, their plans to reshape global commerce – Musk usually operates in the short term, the realm of impulse. When he sees a problem, he decides to fix it; at least, that’s the image he promulgates.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Results may vary. When a group of young Thai soccer players found themselves trapped in a cave back in 2018, Musk offered up his companies’ services for the extraction international rescue mission. The soccer players were eventually saved without his help, and one of the rescuers ended up suing Musk for defamation. When the Tesla CEO got fed up with traffic in Los Angeles, he started a new company dedicated to digging a network of transporter tunnels under major cities. Futuristic as it sounds, The Boring Company has been met with widespread skepticism from industry experts and civil engineers.  A similar dynamic may be at play in Musk’s recent Twitter power grab. As of last week, Musk owns 9.2% of Twitter (TWTR). And there are high hopes, especially from the historically libertarian crypto industry, that he might reform one of the world's most valuable communications platforms.  But while Musk might be at least somewhat culturally aligned with crypto, it’s hard to imagine his involvement in Twitter will bring about a haven for “free speech” – at least, not the kind the industry imagines.  A tweet-y bird  Musk’s impulsive decisions often start out as impulsive posts on Twitter. So when he conducted a poll earlier this month about whether the social media platform “rigorously adheres” to the principle of free speech and followed it up with the disclaimer that “the consequences of this poll will be important,” it was fair to assume some immediate action was at hand.  Musk spent $3 billion on Twitter stock the following week and became the company’s largest shareholder. He then refiled his mandated disclosure of the new stake to clarify he would be an “active” investor – a major force behind the development of the product. And when Parag Agrawal, Twitter’s CEO, announced Musk would join the company’s board, that initial $3 billion bet began to look like a possible regime change.  It was a surprise, then, when Agrawal made another announcement late Sunday evening: Musk had seemingly changed his mind about joining the board.  Agrawal’s note is opaque, but it does offer a few clues about what may be going on behind the scenes. The current board members, wrote Agrawal, “believed that having Elon as a fiduciary of the company where he, like all board members, has to act in the best interests of the company and all our shareholders, was the best path forward.”  One implication of this drawn-out, finger-wagging sentence is that Musk had been informed of his responsibilities and decided to abdicate them by staying away from the board.  Musk has always enjoyed the posture of the capricious billionaire, but he also just seems to like speaking transparently, online.  Ironically, that was part of what made him a public hero (and in some eyes a villain) during the crypto 2021 bull market. The rise of dogecoin – once a lowly meme coin and now a major token listed on top exchanges – is owed mostly to Musk’s breathless tweets. Traders liked that he could pump the price of his favorite dog-themed coin with a single post, without having to worry about the consequences. (Perhaps speaking to that dynamic, DOGE spiked 10% following news that Musk took a majority stake in the microblogging platform.)  In the world of traditional equities, promotional tweets from a billionaire with undisclosed investments might look more like market manipulation than anything else. But thanks to the comparatively light regulations around crypto, Musk can tweet as much as he wants.  Deciding by polls  This past weekend, Musk was starting to crowdsource product ideas for Twitter via polls on the site. Among the possibly serious suggestions: adding an “edit button” for tweets, selling verified check marks to anyone who wants one and turning Twitter headquarters into a homeless shelter, “since no one shows up anyway.”  It’s no accident that all of these tweets have since been deleted.  The sort of reckless, tweet-forward thought leadership that works in crypto doesn't necessarily fly in the traditional business world. It doesn’t even work for the companies Musk already controls: back in 2018, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accused Musk of fraud over a tweet about Tesla’s share prices.  Ironically, as a senior employee at crypto exchange Coinbase pointed out, Musk’s Twitter polls almost functioned like a voting mechanism for a DAO, or decentralized autonomous organization. Where DAOs ask token holders to make decisions collectively, via on-chain voting programs, Musk was asking Twitter users for input about the product.  See also: Most Influential 2021: Elon Musk  There was no consideration for market research, for feasibility, for any of the traditional metrics an executive might use to evaluate whether a change is worth pursuing. And while there’s no telling whether Musk might have tried to force any of those changes through, the directness of the tweets (bolstered by Musk’s apparent willingness to reshape an entire company based on the results of a single poll) is startling.  In abandoning the Twitter board, Musk is affirming his commitment to posting; no wonder he gets along with the crypto crowd.",NEUTRAL,DOGE,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Will Gottsegen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/04/11/elon-musk-twitter-and-running-things-like-a-dao,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c12e5986bb33153f74c20728d96b78d707ce1834-4233x3214.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The films are just the latest boost in what has been a stellar six weeks for a project many now see as the face of the non-fungible token (NFT) sector. That includes the launch of the ApeCoin (APE) token on March 18 and the acquisition of rival blue-chip project CryptoPunks by BAYC's parent company, Yuga Labs, the week prior.  The first of three installments for the series of animated short films, titled “The Degen Trilogy,” will premiere at NFT.NYC in June, with the NFT community of apes and non-apes alike having a say in parts of the film’s plot.  Bored Ape owners are invited to submit their apes for consideration as characters in the trilogy, along with made-up character descriptions that will be reviewed by an actual Hollywood casting director.  More surprising than the fact that these films will exist may be the company making them. Coinbase is testing out its new media arm for the films’ production, led by entertainment and culture marketing director William Swann, brought over by the company from the traditional entertainment world.  “You can think of this as a love letter to the NFT tech that has provided so much creative liberation for artists,” Swann told CoinDesk in an interview. “We really look to [Bored Apes] as sort of our North Star in the NFT space. They've created such a massive and engaging community.”  After their release, the films will be “wallet-gated” on the Coinbase website, with users having to create a Coinbase wallet before being able to view them. The series will also tie into Coinbase’s long-awaited NFT marketplace, which will be released “very very soon,” according to Swann.  I want my NFT TV  Bored Apes aren’t the only NFTs set to make an appearance on the big screen. Swann said Mutant Apes, another Yuga Labs-owned project, will be receiving the same treatment, along with other popular projects yet to be named.  While Yuga Labs isn’t directly involved with the film’s production, “their eyes and approval will be on it,” Swann said.  Yuga Labs CEO Nicole Muniz told CoinDesk in a statement:  “We’re seeing how NFTs are evolving to be vehicles of access and participation in networks, games, merchandise and now interactive entertainment. This is a breakthrough project and we’re excited to see how this shapes the future of Web 3 for all communities.”  “The Degen Trilogy” will not be the first time the buzzy ape imagery has been used off-chain, so to speak.

Liquidity is a key component of DeFi applications, specially DEXs. They need constant supply and demand to stay liquid, and without trading activity, they will fail. Traditional order book-based models were incapable of enforcing liquidity consistency when decentralized participants were involved in DEX protocols. As a result of AMMs, those who use smart contracts (code deployed on the blockchain) do not have to be concerned about the liquidity requirements of a DEX. It&apos;s important to cover some ground before diving into the details of vampire attacks on AMMs and the effects they have on these platforms. DEXs and AMMS: Using a DEX, users can trade crypto tokens with each other without the need for a third-party intermediary. Customers do not have to submit any personal information to use the platform, making it possible for them to trade anonymously. But since all transactions are recorded on the blockchain, DEXs are not completely anonymous. DEXs can be classified into two main categories: DEXs Based on Order Books: A DEX based on an order book enables users to buy and sell orders at their desired prices, while orders are recorded in a central ledger and users retain ownership of their assets.

42395584,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASy4UT,1649701553,Former Ethereum Developer Virgil Griffith to Be Sentenced in New York Court Tuesday,"Former Ethereum developer Virgil Griffith is set to face sentencing in a New York courthouse on April 12 after pleading guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate international sanctions against North Korea last September.  Griffith was arrested in November 2019 after giving a presentation on cryptocurrency and blockchain technology in Pyongyang, the capital of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), in April of that year.  U.S. prosecutors accused Griffith of teaching North Koreans how to evade sanctions – a violation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). Griffith’s plea deal could see him serve between 63 and 78 months in prison (approximately 5 to 6 1/2 years). The government has also asked the judge to fine Griffith up to $1,000,000 to deter him and others from “similar conduct in the future.”  Though the potential sentence is a hefty one, it is a fraction of the maximum sentence of 20 years Griffith could have faced if he chose to take his chances with a jury trial. Griffith’s lawyers have asked the court to consider a more lenient sentence of two years, with credit for time served in jail, and a period of three years’ supervised release, including 270 days of home detention.  Griffith’s guilty plea, which was entered the morning his trial was slated to start, came as a surprise to many following the case. Griffith’s attorneys have not commented publicly on their client’s decision to plead guilty at the eleventh hour, but some have speculated that a host of pandemic-related setbacks and mounting evidence against Griffith led the former developer to take the government’s deal.  Read more: Why Did Virgil Griffith Plead Guilty?  Neither Griffith nor the government dispute the facts of the case: Griffith has always admitted to his trip to Pyongyang, informing the U.S. State Department of his plans to go (and ignoring warnings from U.S. officials not to) months before his departure. The prosecution even had footage of Griffith’s presentation from the conference.  Instead, it is Griffith’s intent and impact in traveling to North Korea that will be weighed by the court.  Vitalik asks for mercy  In a sentencing submission to the court, nearly 40 of Griffith’s friends, family members and former colleagues wrote letters to U.S. District Judge Kevin Castel of the Southern District of New York.  Their letters painted a picture of Griffith as a generous and gentle soul, who “sees the good in everyone” – optimism which pushed him to travel to North Korea to share his knowledge of blockchain technology.  Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin was one of those who wrote on behalf of Griffith, detailing his seven-year friendship with the former Ethereum Foundation employee.  In his letter, Buterin wrote that Griffith’s nature “left a lasting legacy in the Ethereum Foundation and the wider community” as well as on Buterin himself.  “His attitudes and actions over the years helped to foster an open-mindedness and an orientation towards cooperation that guide my actions to this day, in a way that was absent from my personality five years ago,” Buterin wrote.  Buterin also told the judge about Griffith’s long-standing curiosity about other cultures, which led him to move to Singapore in 2016 and his work to make Ethereum compatible with Islamic finance law.  This curiosity about other cultures, including North Korea, was also highlighted in a somber letter from Griffith himself to the judge, in which he writes that he “became obsessed with seeing the country before it fell, akin to someone offered the chance to see East Berlin in its final days before the Wall came down.”  Prosecution offers proof of sanctions evasion  The prosecution has given little credence to Griffith’s explanations of the motives behind his trip to Pyongyang.  In a sentencing submission to the court dated March 18, prosecutors urged the court to stick to the sentencing guidelines set out in the plea deal to “promote respect for the law.”  “Teaching our adversaries how to subvert sanctions – which is precisely what the defendant did in this case with North Korea – is gravely serious conduct that jeopardizes the efficacy of the sanctions regime and endangers the public,” prosecutors wrote in the memo.  The document includes dozens of texts and emails between Griffith and other parties in the year preceding his trip, in which he talks about his plans to visit the country to set up an Ethereum node.  Over and over, Griffith remarked to various parties, including his friends and a British tour organizer that traveled to North Korea, that blockchain technology could “let them get around sanctions” and “help them circumvent the current sanctions on them.”  The document also includes a transcript of Griffith’s remarks at the conference, captured by an unnamed witness, as well as photos of Griffith, clad in a traditional-style North Korean suit, writing on a white board, on which “No sanctions!” was written with a smiley face.  “I work for a group called the Ethereum Foundation,” Griffith is reported as saying. “I think the most valuable things we have to offer the DPRK are, number one … blockchain gives you payments that the USA can’t stop.”  Prior to his guilty plea, Griffith’s defense seemed to rest on the limited impact of his presentation and actions in North Korea; specifically, that the information he provided was “publicly known” and “high level general information” not specifically aimed at evading sanctions.  The evidence presented by the prosecution in their sentencing memo seeks to undermine this claim, as well as the defense’s attempt to paint Griffith and his intentions in a positive light.  “Griffith acted to shamelessly violate the law, openly betting on the likelihood that he would receive leniency later,” the prosecution writes. “That corrupt spirit merits deterrence for both Griffith and for similarly situated others.”  The North Korean regime loves crypto  Years before Virgil Griffith ever set foot in the DPRK, North Korean hackers had already become a malevolent force in the global crypto scene.  In 2017, two years before Griffith’s trip, South Korean intelligence officials reported that North Korean hackers had stolen tens of millions of dollars in cryptocurrencies from various exchanges.  The infamous hacking group Lazarus, widely believed to be sponsored by the North Korean regime, has been implicated in multiple hacks of crypto exchanges, with damages in the hundreds of millions of dollars.  According to research from crypto research firm Chainalysis, North Korean hackers stole over $400 million worth of crypto, mostly Ether, from decentralized exchanges in 2021 alone.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/04/11/former-ethereum-developer-virgil-griffith-to-be-sentenced-in-new-york-court-tomorrow,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/db19e891a3107ae10082ef2541a1c40eb607a94a-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Considering steep losses in the past trading sessions, LUNA may fall to retest $78. Past Performance The Terra coin is dumping at spot rates, falling eight percent in the previous 24 hours and a massive 24 percent on the last trading week. LUNA is within a bear breakout pattern, falling from 2022 highs as sellers step up in a retracement. Terra LUNA Technical Analysis From the daily chart, LUNA is pulling back from $120. It is also below the 20-day moving average in a correction. Based on the LUNA candlestick arrangement in the daily chart, traders might find trading opportunities in every retest back to April 11 highs and the middle BB at $90 and $100, respectively. As sellers step up, the Terra price may retest $78—the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement level. At later stages, it could drop to $60—the 78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement level if the correction is profound. Any sharp spike unwinding recent losses and forcing the coin above the middle BB invalidates the bearish preview. What to Expect? The Terra coin is under strong selling pressure at spot rates, breaking below a multi-week flexible support line of the middle BB.

42395587,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASy4XQ,1649697679,Crypto Funds See Largest Weekly Outflows Since January,"Crypto funds last week suffered their largest outflow since January as investors withdrew money from bitcoin and Ethereum funds, CoinShares reported on Monday.  The funds had $134 million in net outflows, which marked the second worst week in the year for funds that manage digital asset investments and represented a sharp turn after two straight weeks of heavy inflows.  Bitcoin-related products took the lion’s share of the outflows with $131.8 million of redemptions. Short bitcoin investment products, which bet on making profits when bitcoin’s price declines, saw inflows totaling $2 million, their largest inflow on record.  The reversal came after the price of bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, rose to $48,000 from $38,000 in only two weeks by early April.  “We believe price appreciation the previous week may have prompted investors to take profits,” the report said. Lower daily trading volumes ($2.3 billion) than the average also suggest that there isn’t significant stress among investors.  Funds focused on Ethereum (ETH) saw $15.3 million in outflows, which brought year-to-date total outflows to $126 million.  Meanwhile, altcoins (excluding Ethereum) and multiple-asset funds stayed resilient and recorded inflows of $6 million and $5 million, respectively.  Breaking down the funds by assets, solana (SOL) led the way with $3.7 million in inflows, down from $8.2 million the week before, bringing its year-to-date inflows to $107 million.  Funds focused on cardano (ADA) saw $1 million in inflows, while $600,000 flowed into litecoin (LTC) funds.  Outflows were broad among providers as both European and America-based funds booked outflows, with American providers representing 61% of the outflows.  Funds managed by ProShares and ETC Group took the biggest hit with outflows of $64.5 million and $45.8 million, respectively.

42421188,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXgIWL,1649694026,Michael Levy: How to Turn Your NFT Into a Loan,"Michael Levy is a non-fungible token (NFT) investor and crypto entrepreneur, currently launching a portal for NFT-collateralized loans called Flowty. But Levy is not a diehard “crypto native” – and that’s exactly what makes him significant.  Rather than arriving in the space from the technical side like so many current leaders and builders, the self-described “relative normie” got sucked in by following a lifelong yen for sports collecting towards its logical future.  “Before I found NFTs, the most passion I had for collecting was around MLB bobbleheads,” he told CoinDesk. “A friend of mine and I would pick out a new stadium every year and travel there for a bobblehead game.”  This article is part of Road to Consensus, a series highlighting speakers and the big ideas they will discuss at Consensus 2022, CoinDesk's festival of the year June 9-12 in Austin, Texas. Learn more.  That, of course, was before the COVID-19 pandemic. Like just about everyone else, Levy found himself bored during the early-pandemic lockdowns. But unlike noob traders who fired up Robinhood or Coinbase to fill the gaping existential void, Levy didn’t have to stray far from his before-times pursuits.  “In September of 2020,” he said, “I saw a tweet that the NBA had announced and released digital collectibles.” He immediately tried to sign up for NBA Top Shot, the video-clip NFT series, but the platform was still in closed beta at the time. Levy said he finagled an invite by messaging the Top Shot team directly, joining when “there were probably 200 or 250 active users. Very early days.”  Top Shot quickly became the first truly successful major NFT brand, generating huge interest and skyrocketing prices in early 2021, before retracing significantly as the broader NFT frenzy cooled. Levy’s early involvement paid off big-time. But it wasn’t crypto expertise that opened his eyes to the opportunity.  “I looked at this as someone who collected sports cards growing up,” he said. “In many ways, this is just sports cards 2.0. They’re much more shareable, and they’re essentially borderless.”  Of course, the key difference is that you can hold a bobblehead or a baseball card in your hand. But as a veteran collector, Levy doesn’t think that’s a huge distinction.  This is just sports cards 2.0. They’re much more shareable, and they’re essentially borderless  “If you break down what makes a physical object attractive to you … a lot, if not all of those same principles apply to digital assets,” he argued. “What makes it meaningful is not the physical cardboard, not the image, not the reaction that the image evokes. It’s simply that it signals to people around you that ‘I’m a basketball fan, I value scarce objects and I like this player and I like this team.’”  But crypto also makes it possible to do crazy new things with those collectibles, such as easily using them as collateral for loans. Levy’s new Flowty platform is meant to make that easy, and its peer-to-peer nature partly addresses the major challenge of how to value these volatile digital assets as collateral. The answer is simple: Flowty lets users decide.  “You pick an NFT from your inventory and you input the [loan] parameters you’re looking for. You might say, I have an NFT. I think it’s worth $5,000. I want to borrow $2,000 against it, and I’m willing to pay 3% over a 30 day period. And if [a lender is] comfortable with the offer, they are free to fund that loan. Then lenders either get the loan paid back or they get the collateral [NFT], and the counterparty can’t do anything hostile. It’s all trustless and decentralized.”  Also from Road to Consensus: Jeff Kauffman - DAOs Will Own Big Brands  There are concerns that financializing NFTs could have unpredictable market impacts or increase holder risk. But as Levy points out, once you get past the technology, Flowty isn’t doing anything all that radical. “You can take a watch or a painting to a pawn shop and get a loan. It’s a very, very similar transaction.”  One uncertainty Levy sees for the NFT universe is the technical challenge of “bridging” assets from one blockchain to another. Flowty, like Top Shot and CryptoKitties, is built on the Flow blockchain. “As a relatively mainstream person myself, Flow is approachable and user-friendly, and aligned with these huge brands,” Levy said of the network’s core appeal.  But that ease-of-use comes with trade-offs, including “giving up some decentralization and security,” Levy said. That can be mitigated by connecting to other blockchains, but huge recent hacks of connecting “bridges” like Ronin and Wormhole have cast doubt on the viability of such “cross-chain” connections.  “It might just be recency bias, but a lot of people have said if we can’t solve the bridge issue, it might not wind up being a [cross-chain] future,” said Levy. If that thesis holds up, Levy thinks there will be long-term consolidation as isolated chains lose utility. “There will be spin-offs and alternatives, but probably a group of four or five that emerge over time,” he noted.  Naturally he thinks Flow, and its library of infamous dunks, will be one of them.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | FLOW,David Z.

42395590,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASy4aN,1649689830,Ethereum's First Mainnet Shadow Fork Goes Live as Move to PoS Continues,"Ethereum's first mainnet shadow fork went live today, as the developers of the world's second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap continue transitioning the backing network to a proof-of-stake (PoS) model.  The shadow fork is a way to ""stress test our assumptions around syncing and state growth,"" tweeted Parithosh Jayanthi, an Ethereum Foundation developer, on April 10. He added that it will also provide ""a way to check if our assumptions work on existing testnets and/or mainnet.""  Ethereum has been working on a multi-stage shift to a PoS consensus algorithm that will replace the current proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism. In the PoS model, transactions will be validated by nodes run by “stakers” instead of “miners.” The switch is expected to significantly reduce the energy required for the network to run, a key point of contention for the Bitcoin network, which runs on PoW.  The shadow fork will share some of the data with the main Ethereum network, so some transactions could appear on both chains, Jayanthi cautioned. The shadow fork has already processed 1,166,016 transactions with an average block time of 14.8 seconds as of the time of writing, according to a block explorer page shared by the developer Marius Van Der Wijden.  The outcome of the shadow fork is key to determining the timing of the final merge, said Ethereum developer Tim Beiko, according to Galaxy Digital Research Associate Christine Kim.  'Historical event'  Earlier on Monday, Van Der Wijden, an Ethereum Foundation developer who came up with the shadow fork, according to Jayanthi, tweeted that the shadow fork is a ""historical event."" The foundation has previously tried shadow forks of the Görli testnet, a proof-of-authority blockchain used for testing decentralized applications.  In mid-March, another key milestone was reached with Kiln testnet merge, when a PoW execution layer merged with a PoS Beacon Chain. This was scheduled as the last merge testnet before the final move to PoS.  According to Jayanthi, the Kiln merge testnet was designed ""to allow the community to practice running their nodes, deploying contracts, testing infrastructure, etc."" The shadow fork goes a step further to stress test the network, he said.  Once today's shadow fork went live, the developer team noticed some issues with Ethereum-based software systems provider Nethermind and Hyperledger Besu, a Java-based open-source Ethereum client, Jayanthi tweeted on Monday.  The percentage of validators doing their job, also known as the participation rate in the network, dropped, but the network is still above the mining requirement for finality, according to Jayanthi.

42394244,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvag8d,1649684700,3 Crypto Tax Tips to Avoid IRS Trouble,"For most taxpayers, assembling tax returns and filing is a painful process. For those who had crypto activity in 2021, the process can be even more troublesome.  Transfers between wallets are common for investors looking to interact with different products offered by crypto exchanges and decentralized protocols. This level of activity makes recording every taxable transaction difficult.  Miles Brooks is a Certified Public Account and is the Director of Tax Strategy at CoinLedger.  Crypto investors filing their taxes must know how to track cost basis, maintain good records of all original purchases and transactions, and report everything in U.S. dollar terms. This is all in addition to making decisions – oftentimes without IRS guidance – as to the taxability of certain gray-area transactions, due to the ever-evolving nature of the cryptocurrency ecosystem.  CryptoTrader.Tax (rebranding to CoinLedger), commissioned a survey and published a report that found that almost 25% of crypto investors who didn’t report crypto on their tax return said they didn’t know crypto was taxable. Another 20% said they didn’t know how to report their crypto activity.  Cryptocurrency tax reporting software can help ensure investors avoid IRS scrutiny, which has grown sharper in recent years as more people invest in digital assets. As you file this year’s crypto taxes, here are also three important, common-sense tips to help you avoid the IRS' notice.  Read more: US Crypto Tax Guide 2022  Exchanging your crypto for another crypto or for NFTs is a taxable event  The IRS considers crypto property, which means that if you sell or dispose of it for another digital asset, you have to report the transaction on your tax return.  A common misconception is that if you don’t trade crypto back to U.S. dollars, you do not owe taxes on any gain. But trading one crypto for another is a disposal event, which is taxable and must be reported.  This rule covers exchanging any crypto, such as ETH, for a non-fungible token (NFT). NFTs are applicable to the same rules as cryptocurrency. Note when you purchase an NFT, you do this most of the time by disposing of your ETH or another crypto. When this occurs you have taxable gain or loss on that ETH or other crypto that you’ve used to make the NFT purchase.  If you earned income from crypto and then later sold, you have two different taxable events  There are many different ways to earn crypto, including mining, airdrops, staking your coins or through earning interest. When you earn crypto in this way, you have ordinary income to report. The amount you report is the fair market value of the crypto you earned when you received it. You should report this income on your tax return on Schedule 1, as ""Other Income."" From there, if you decide to sell your earned coins, you will have a capital gain or loss, depending on how the price of your crypto has changed from when you earned it.  You won’t end up paying taxes on the same income twice. The income you report on your tax return from earning the coins becomes your cost basis in those coins – which reduces the amount of tax you pay when you eventually sell.  Read more: It’s Tax Time Again. Do We Really Know What That Means for Crypto?  Know when to mark ‘yes’ to the front-page question about virtual currency  At the beginning of the tax return, front and center, there’s a question of whether you engaged in any transaction involving virtual currency. If you received crypto, exchanged your crypto, or disposed of your crypto in 2021, you must answer yes.  If your crypto activity was limited to strictly purchasing crypto, holding crypto, or moving crypto from one wallet or account to another that you own or control, you can answer no to the question.  Investing and transacting with cryptocurrencies comes with the responsibility of reporting your taxable crypto transactions on your return. And although crypto taxes can be complex, the tools available can make the process easier.

Dash is marketed to both individual users and institutions, including merchants, financial services, traders, and those who need to send international remittances. In October 2020, Dash Core Group reported that its strategic objectives moving forward include building its ecosystem and brand, ensuring that users are satisfied and further advancing the technology behind the network. Dash uses a two-tier network to secure its transactions. The first tier consists of nodes that carry out mining operations under a proof-of-work consensus protocol, meaning that they compete to solve complex cryptographic problems and at least 51% of nodes must approve a transaction for it to be added to the blockchain. What is Dash (DASH)? Dash was founded by software developers Evan Duffield and Kyle Hagan. The project was originally called XCoin, changing its name to Darkcoin two weeks later before rebranding again to Dash in March 2015 in an effort to positively change its image. Dash is an open-source blockchain and cryptocurrency focused on offering a fast, cheap global payments network that is decentralized in nature.

42394239,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvafiz,1649683800,Want to See the Future of Banks? Look at Telcos,"If you want a sneak peek at how DeFi is likely to transform the banking industry, the history of the telecom industry in the U.S. may turn out to be a good guide.  In 1983, the “Bell System” was a national monopoly on telecommunications in the United States. This included voice and data, local and long-distance, and even network equipment. Truly, there were few companies that had more power, prestige or history than AT&T in 1983.  Paul Brody is EY's global blockchain leader and a CoinDesk columnist.  On Jan. 1, 1984, this monopoly ended. The Bell System, as it was known, was broken apart into its component businesses, igniting one of history’s biggest industry reconfigurations, the final results of which are really only now just playing out.  At first, only small parts of these businesses were exposed to substantial competition – mostly the long-distance business. Over time, however, new technologies such as wireless and Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP) started to upend the entire business.  Just like telecom before, the finance industry is transforming. Fintech services, challenger banks and now blockchain and crypto are all hammering at the industry’s long-standing traditional deposit, lending, payments and securities operations.  Telecom network operators responded to the increased competition in the industry with two major strategies. The first was to reconsolidate the industry through mergers and acquisitions. The original 10 long-distance and regional operators from 1984 are down to four players through consolidation.  The second strategy was vertical integration with the media and entertainment industry. As competition intensified, the biggest fear that many industry leaders had was they would become “dumb pipes.” Telcos looked upon the “over the top” (OTT) providers with envy. OTT startups and media companies depended on data networks to deliver their content and services, but the telcos earned no margin on that.  Read more: No, DeFi Is Not a Repeat of the 2008 Crisis  The fight between telcos and the OTT companies became so intense that wireless operators refused to sell early smartphones that included Wi-Fi, and they attempted to block third-party navigation and maps services so they could sell their own for an additional monthly fee. The effort was futile as aggressive new entrants offered phones with Wi-Fi and data plans without restrictions.  More importantly, over time, many telecom network operators discovered something critical to their strategy: that they simply were not good at developing and maintaining software apps or media and entertainment services. They also came to appreciate what a powerful barrier to entry their large physical infrastructure represented.  While it may not be “cutting edge” or earn a lot of respect on Wall Street, knowing the ins and outs of San Francisco zoning rules and being able to get a new cell tower installed is highly specialized knowledge that limits competition. Making and launching apps costs millions of dollars. Making and running networks cost billions.  The result, today, is after hundreds of billions of dollars of mergers and acquisitions, and equally large write-offs and divestitures, telecom network operators are (mostly) back to running telecom networks.  A similar pattern?  The same pattern might be about to play out in the banking and finance world. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) looks a lot like a set of OTT applications. Just like smartphone apps and content, DeFi services can be launched into the market quickly and at low costs. DeFi services are not burdened by legacy compliance costs or legacy technology systems. The result: DeFi services are often better, faster and cheaper than available legacy banking options.  And, just like OTT services, there’s a catch: You can’t use an app without a phone, and you can’t use DeFi without a bank or centralized exchange account. Every user must be able to convert their fiat into (and later out of) tokens. Those fiat on and off-ramps are also much more complex to maintain and operate because these are centralized entities subject to regulatory control and compliance. Keeping those records and processes up to date and integrated with the rest of the financial system is costly and complex.  Read more: DeFi More Disruptive to Banks Than Bitcoin, Says ING  In the coming years, the world’s banks will face a series of competitive dilemmas similar to the ones that telecom network operators faced in the last 30 years. On the one hand, they can earn significant new market share by offering their customers access to the crypto and DeFi ecosystem, but that market share may not be nearly as profitable as it was in the past. Instead of getting loans and financial services in-house, new customers will be able to comparison shop across the whole DeFi ecosystem.  Some banks are also going to try to launch their own competing DeFi services. From stablecoins to secured lending, banks will need to identify where they have a substantive competitive advantage. A pure algorithm-based offering may be a hard sell and about as successful as a telecom operator trying stand-up comedy.  The crypto world’s best developers may not find it easy to fit in the biggest banks. Integrating on-chain and off-chain services, however, will present opportunities for differentiation. Loans secured with more stable off-chain assets like homes can be bigger and cheaper and lower risk than purely on-chain offerings. The closer banks get to their competitive strengths, the more likely they are to be successful.  Peter Drucker famously said that culture eats strategy for breakfast. A financially conservative, regulatory-focused culture is going to find the hyperactive innovation and decentralization-first ethos of the DeFi ecosystem hard to sustain internally. The most visionary banks may be the ones that decide to double down on the strengths of their culture and the businesses that align with that rather than trying to become something entirely different.

Sign up here to get it in your inbox each weekday morning.  Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market Moves: Bitcoin's options market shows renewed bias for downside protection. The cryptocurrency has dived out of an ascending trendline.  Featured Story: TheFederal Reserve may abandon its fight against inflation if and when the corporate credit market shows signs of stress.  And check out the CoinDesk TV show “First Mover,” hosted by Christine Lee, Emily Parker and Lawrence Lewitinn at 9 a.m. U.S. Eastern time.  Kapil Rathi, co-founder and CEO, CrossTower  David Kemmerer, co-founder and CEO, CoinLedger  Ioannis Giannaros, co-founder and CEO, Wyre  Market Moves  By Omkar Godbole  Nervousness seems to have seeped into the bitcoin market with the cryptocurrency's break of a bullish trendline amid renewed macro fears.  Put-call skews, which measure the difference between implied volatility premiums of calls and put options, are again trending higher, indicating a renewed bias for puts, which are options that offer downside protection.  Notably, the six-month skew has increased from -1% to 5% in one week. The one-week, one- and three-month metrics have seen similar moves, according to data provided by Skew.  ""In the current market, the most practical way to hedge with puts is still primarily done in BTC and ETH compared to any other altcoins,"" CJ Fong, head of Asia sales at crypto liquidity provider GSR, said. ""We see BTC skew trending relatively higher than ETH skew with bears taking increasingly polar positions.  ""With regards to altcoin (alternative cryptocurrencies) bearishness, we are seeing these expressed in terms of near-strike call selling rather than buying of puts,"" Fong added.  Noelle Acheson, head of market insights at Genesis Global, said, ""We are seeing growing interest in covered strategies. Volatilities have been continuing their trend down, making some expiries notably cheap."" (Genesis Global is owned by Digital Currency Group, which is CoinDesk's parent company.)  Implied volatility looks cheap  The one-week implied volatility, which gauges expected price turbulence over the next seven days, fell under 50% annualized over the weekend, which was its lowest level since November 2020. The one-, three- and six-month gauges also continued to decline.  All gauges are now cheaper compared with their lifetime average. Further, the three-month implied volatility is cheaper than the three-month realized volatility. In other words, volatility expectations are underpriced, which, according to options theory, is the best time to take long straddles/strangles, which involve buying both call and put options.  ""At this stage, though, buying some BTC puts can be profitable to some extent. Implied volatility remains near all-time lows and hasn't seen a significant uptick in response to recent price declines,"" Griffin Ardern, volatility trader at crypto asset management firm Blofin, said. ""This means that the time value (aka ""theta"") we need to pay will not be too much. Still, once there is any turbulence, whether from a volatility perspective or price direction perspective, the probability of having some profit significantly increases.""  BTC chart leans bearish  Bitcoin dipped to $41,000 soon before press time, having invalidated the bullish trendline from February lows over the weekend. The 14-day relative strength index has entered the bearish territory under 50, supporting a continued price decline.  The immediate support is about $40,000. ""On the support side, buying activity has been concentrated around the $40,000 level, where 820,000 BTC was previously acquired, making this the price to watch out for,"" Lucas Outumuro, head of research at blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock, said in a newsletter published Friday.

By Omkar Godbole  The return to risk aversion has revived the discussion about the so-called Fed put, or at what point will the world's most powerful central bank step in to save markets.  One narrative says that sustained positive real yields will force the Fed to throw in the towel, while another says the reversal of tightening will happen next year after the economy falls into recession.  Quill Intelligence CEO Danielle DiMartino Booth says the Fed will spring into action once there are signs of stress in the corporate credit market, according to Arthur Hayes, co-founder and former CEO of crypto spot and derivatives exchange BitMEX.  ""I had a phone conversation with her last week, and asked where the Fed put is. She responded that (Fed Chairman) Jay Powell is a credit guy, and is deeply concerned about financial contagion in the corporate bond markets,"" Hayes wrote in a blog post called ""The Q-Trap.""  ""She reminded me that the Fed effectively nationalized the U.S. corporate credit markets by backstopping BBB-rated companies during the COVID March 2020 crash. Absent this support, the corporate borrowing markets would have a supporting role in the film 'Frozen,' "" Hayes said.  While the spread between the BBB-rate U.S. corporate 10-year and two-year bond yields has narrowed, it is still at least 100 basis points short of inversion, a sign of stress. Therefore, the Fed appears to have plenty to room to tighten the policy with rapid-fire rate hikes and a balance sheet run-off.  ""As this chart clearly shows, at +1%, the spread has a bit farther to fall before it is inverted. When this curve inverts – and I believe it will, due to softening global demand driven by commodity price inflation from the Russian / Ukraine conflict– how far down the hole will the NDX have fallen,"" Hayes noted, referring to the chart below.  ""Down 30%? … Down 50%? … your guess is as good as mine. But let’s be clear – the Fed isn’t planning to grow its balance sheet again any time soon, meaning equities ain’t going any higher,"" Hayes added.

Along with Huobi Incubator and Kucoin Ventures, MEXC Pioneer Fund, 3Commas Capital, Orbs, TON Miners and Kilo Fund have committed $250 million to support the fund.  The fund will support developers building on The Open Network (TON) blockchain through incubation, investments and grants, the TON Foundation announced on Monday.  TON is a layer 1 proof-of-stake blockchain compatible with messaging service Telegram. Unlike its predecessor, however, Toncoin is independent from Telegram, though CEO Pavel Durov gave the project his endorsement at the end of last year.  Furthermore, the plan is for Toncoin to be integrated into Telegram, making it available to the messaging app's 500 million monthly users.  Telegram shut TON down in August 2020 following a lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) around allegations of running an unregistered securities sale in 2018 that had brought in $1.7 billion.  Members of the TON community, however, continued to develop the blockchain, rebranding the project Toncoin. Now the Ton Foundation has launched its first ecosystem fund to support projects wishing to build on it.

42395585,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASy4VS,1649682000,Avalanche-Based Blockbuster Game Shrapnel Completes $7M Token Sale,"Shrapnel, a futuristic shoot-'em-up game built on the Avalanche blockchain, has completed a $7 million token sale that included participation from Dragonfly and Three Arrows Capital, as well as angel investors, such as Keith Nunziata of Citadel Global Equities and Jason Zhao at Kleiner Perkins.  Neon, the games studio building Shrapnel that is a spin-off from HBO Interactive, raised $10.5 million in a November seed round led by Griffin Gaming Partners alongside Polychain Capital.  With the excitement around decentralized finance (DeFi) cooling somewhat, and blue-chip non-fungible tokens (NFTs) now well established, venture capital is gravitating towards the GameFi catchall, where players typically earn cryptocurrency and NFT rewards by completing tasks and battling other players.  But it’s early days in GameFi, with lessons to be learned, suggesting a need for lots of new tokenomics infrastructure and greater interoperability.  Shrapnel CEO Mark Long, who has worked on blockbuster games for platforms ranging from Sega Genesis to Playstation 4 for clients including Disney, Ubisoft and the U.S. Army, said the first generation of play-to-earn suffers from a “particularly egregious form of digital sharecropping,” with low earners in places like Peru and the Philippines grinding away to create returns with characters they can’t afford to own outright.  Long also mentions the Quartz fiasco, Ubisoft’s overly hasty plunge into NFTs, when it comes to shaping his vision for how Shrapnel, which he says is the first store-quality production on Avalanche, should operate.  Read more: Crypto Fans Rejoice, Gamers Revolt as Ubisoft Announces NFT Plans  “I think the first developer that publishes the opportunity for players to make a game, a core competitive game of their own, could be one of the next major franchises, and that’s exactly what Shrapnel is,” Long said in an interview. “It’s completely built around the ability for players to mod the game. So we’ll give them the same level of tools that we have as professional developers.”  Developers have introduced metagame, sandbox-style creativity in various ways: Epic Games’ Fortnite Creative uses ledgers to keep track of all the content in the game, for instance. But that’s a process that costs tens of millions of dollars and takes years of development, Long pointed out. “Blockchain is essentially free,” he said. “It’s a technology that anybody can download and mint on.”  Shrapnel is using Avalanche’s subnets architecture, application-specific chains that can be customized to suit the needs and rules of a game. Being able to spin up a blockchain on Avalanche removes a lot of headaches and reduces security risks, said Ed Chang, director of gaming at Ava Labs, the developer of Avalanche.  “We have some game developers who are seeing this as almost like a publishing opportunity,” said Chang in an interview. “If they can build a meaningful enough subnet following for their game, they can attract other games to actually deploy on their subnet as well. So if they have the other games using their token, there’s more value and governance attributes.”  Read more: Avalanche Commits $290M in AVAX to Attract Gaming, DeFi and NFT ‘Subnets’",POSITIVE,AVAX,AVAX | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | TOKEN SALE,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/04/11/avalanche-based-blockbuster-game-shrapnel-completes-7m-token-sale,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fdbaa9972f39f226233de1c9f78462018d15cb46-1124x788.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Stocks in Europe and Asia inched lower, while reports of potential global supply chain disruptions further gripped markets as China’s renewed lockdowns extended to another week.  In Asia, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index ended the day 3% lower, while Shanghai Composite took a 2.61% loss. Over in Europe, Germany’s DAX slid 0.31% and the pan-European stock index Stoxx 600 lost 0.20%. Traders started to price in bearish movement in the US as pre-market futures for Nasdaq dropped 0.67%, while the S&P 500 fell 0.31%.  Bearish sentiment in global markets spread to crypto markets. Terra’s LUNA, Avalanche’s AVAX, and ether (ETH) saw the biggest declines in the past 24 hours outside of bitcoin (BTC) in the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. In European morning hours, ether dropped to just over a major support level at $3,000, losing which could see the asset slide further to the $2,700 mark.  LUNA fell 8% even as Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) added $173 million in bitcoin to its wallet over the weekend, bringing its total holdings to 40,000 bitcoin, as reported. The LFG is a newly formed nonprofit that aims to maintain the Terra ecosystem by building a $10 billion reserve in bitcoin for backing the UST, a stablecoin issued by Terra, one of LFG’s main backers.  LUNA dropped to a previous support level at $85 nearly a week after setting lifetime highs of $120, price charts show. Losing current levels could see it drop further down to the $70 mark, where the next major support exists.  Crypto market capitalization fell to just over $2 trillion, dropping some $260 billion since last week’s $2.27 trillion figure. Bitcoin fell to $41,300 in European morning hours, a 10% decline since last week’s $48,100 mark, a three-month high.  Rising correlation with stocks  Some analysts said recent price action proved the crypto market’s correlation with stocks was rising.  “The crypto market is again increasing its correlation with the dynamics of stocks, or rather, it is guided by the high-tech Nasdaq index,” explained Alex Kuptsikevich, financial analyst at FxPro, in an email to CoinDesk. “This relationship is easily explained by the fact that in both cases, investors are betting on a progressive idea.”  Metrics from earlier this month showed bitcoin ended the first quarter of 2022 trading at a correlation of 0.9 with S&P, where 1 suggests perfect correlation and -1 is perfectly inverted.

42395582,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASy4TU,1649673645,"Bitcoin Slips Under $42K as Mounting Macro Risks, Dollar Strength Overshadow LFG Purchases","Investors looking for clues on bitcoin's recent failure despite continued accumulation by the Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) may want to look at the ever-growing list of macro risks and what's happening in traditional markets.  The world's largest cryptocurrency fell under $42,000 during European trading hours, hitting the lowest level since March 22 and extending the decline from the late March high of $48,240, according to CoinDesk data. The continued slide came even as LFG added $173 million in bitcoin to its wallet over the weekend, boosting its total holdings to almost 40,000 BTC.  The weakness perhaps stems from traditional investors refusing to follow LFG's lead, considering the several economic and political uncertainties stalking the risk assets, according to Noelle Acheson, head of market insights at Genesis Global Trading, which is owned by CoinDesk parent Digital Currency Group.  ""The DXY strength is part of it, but overall it's more market uncertainty, macro concern and a focus on what rates will do,"" Acheson said in a Telegram chat.  The dollar index (DXY), which tracks the greenback's value against a basket of major currencies, tapped two-year highs above 100 early today, taking the year-to-date gain to 4.3%, according to data provided by charting platform TradingView. The global reserve currency has risen 1.5% this month.  According to Kevin Kelly, co-founder and global head of macro strategy at Delphi Digital, the greenback and bitcoin have a pretty inverse correlation. ""2017 was one of the worst years for the dollar, and that coincided with a huge run in bitcoin,"" Kelly said in an analyst call in March. ""We saw bitcoin run up in early 2021. That was on the back of the dollar weakness.""  Griffin Ardern, volatility trader from crypto asset management firm Blofin, said, ""when the DXY has reached highs and climbed further, it usually indicates further declines in other assets, whether it is the stock market, cryptocurrencies or FX.""  That's true even more so now given the ongoing dollar rally is being fueled by hawkish Federal Reserve officials, calling for a faster pace of interest rate increases and balance sheet runoff to curb rapid inflation. Policy tightening is considered bearish for risk assets, including bitcoin.  According to a Reuters poll, the Fed will likely raise rates by 50 basis points during the May and June meetings, having raised borrowing costs by 25 basis points last month. The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield has risen to a two-year high of 2.7%.  The cryptocurrency's sensitivity to equity markets is also a cause for concern. Big tech is suffering as the liquidity available to allocate to high-growth sectors is dwindling with markets pricing faster tightening by the Fed. ""We also have increasingly frequent reports of tech company shutdowns, layoffs and/or dwindling term sheets,"" Acheson noted.  Therefore, tech stocks may be in for a significant correction, as predicted by Arthur Hayes, co-founder and former CEO of crypto spot and derivatives exchange BitMEX.  Besides, inflation is getting entrenched worldwide with the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, leaving a virtually zero probability of central banks resorting to liquidity-pumping policies anytime soon.  If all this is not enough, the odds of far-right candidate and European Union-skeptic Marine Le Pen's victory in France'spresidential elections may keep markets on tenterhooks.  European stock futures dropped early today after polls showed French President Emmanuel Macron and nationalist rival Le Pen were the top two vote-getters in Sunday's first round, with 27% and 24%, respectively. Macron's narrow lead has some investors worried that Le Pen would be able to close the gap by consolidating the anti-Macron votes before the April 24 final round.  ""Adding to the impact of the war in Europe, we have the results of the voting yesterday in France, which could – depending on how the next round goes on April 24 – bring even more currency turmoil,"" Acheson added.  ""And with so much uncertainty and nervousness, especially given crypto assets' historical volatility, macro investors are choosing to wait on the sidelines until there are enough signals to take directional bets with some conviction,"" Noelle added.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/04/11/bitcoin-slips-under-42k-as-mounting-macro-risks-dollar-strength-overshadow-lfg-purchases,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a8a4b1c2ed747a00791c888f940c3ba5714081a3-1778x802.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The volumes of four Indian exchanges were collated by analyzing data on CoinMarketCap and Nomics, a data firm. The data reveals a drop of 72% on WazirX, 59% on ZebPay, 52% on CoinDCX and 41% on BitBns. The trading volumes were measured in U.S. dollars.  India now has a 30% tax on profits from crypto transactions and doesn't allow offsetting gains with losses from other crypto transactions. The most controversial provision – the 1% tax deducted at source (TDS) liability – won’t take effect until July 1.  It is unclear whether the drop in trading volumes is because of the new tax law as the drop in volumes on Indian exchanges is largely in line with a global trend.  “April 1, 2, and 3 were holidays. Since then, volumes are continuing to fall. I don’t think this will return,"" Crebaco CEO Sidharth Sogani said.  ""This has created a new benchmark. It can go further down or sideways, but it is unlikely to go back up. It is clear that the new tax has impacted the market negatively. The government must look into this, and because there is no way to stop this (crypto), the government should embrace the technology,” he said.  According to senior crypto lawyer Suril Desai it is unclear whether the drop in volumes means the trading has moved elsewhere. “The only trading volumes we get comes from exchanges. The off-chain trades could be happening for which there is no record,” Desai said.  ZebPay declined to comment, while the other exchanges didn't immediately return requests for comment.  Sathvik Vishwanath, co-founder and CEO of Unocoin, another Indian exchange, said the new tax law is affecting the market.  “People earning less than 1,000,000 (Indian rupees) per year is affected by 30% fixed income tax on crypto. 1% TDS is affecting the market makers and liquidity providers. Both are needed for better crypto ecosystem in India,” Vishwanath tweeted. One million Indian rupees is the equivalent of about $13,000.  Anton Gulin, regional director of the AAX crypto exchange, said the drop in volume should be short term.  ""AAX exchange has seen an outflow of active Indian users within the past weeks, as well. However, I believe that the tax rate may be revised to attract more taxpayers, as this is the ultimate goal for any government,"" Gulin said.  Johnny Lyu, CEO of KuCoin, another trading platform, said that some beginners are less willing to invest in crypto in the short term.  ""KuCoin hasn’t seen any outflow though, according to internal data. This can be explained by the higher degree of crypto nativeness among our users,"" he said. ""The new law will affect short-term market mood and behavior, but it will be difficult to block the adoption of crypto in the long run.""

42410885,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggt33k,1649667569,"Ukraine Crisis Is Not Propelling Crypto Market Activity, Blockchain Data Shows","The political and humanitarian crisis in Europe provoked by the Russian invasion of Ukraine created a massive tide of emigration from both countries. For many migrants and refugees, crypto has become the only tangible way to take their savings with them. However, that hasn't brought any notable boost to the crypto market, research shows.  Blockchain Analytics firm Crystal Blockchain monitored the hot wallets of the major cryptocurrency exchanges working with the Russian ruble and Ukrainian hryvnia, inluding peer-to-peer marketplaces like LocalBitcoins and Paxful, and found no significant fluctuations related to the war and migration.  It's important to remember that major global exchanges that used to support ruble trading pairs introduced their own sanctions against Russian users soon after the war started. For example, Binance stopped accepting payments via Russian bank cards, CEX.io suspended deposits and withdrawals for users from Russia and Belarus (Russia's ally in the war), CoinZoom paused registration of new accounts from Russia.  In early March, Alameda Research noticed that ""Russian and Ukrainian trade volumes [were] soaring."" Crystal notes, however, that there hasn't been a notable spike of on-chain activity, and over the past six months there has been a steady decline in transaction activity across a range of cryptocurrency exchanges, with fund flows falling even more after the onset of war in Ukraine, Crystal told CoinDesk.  Chainalysis also noticed earlier that daily ruble trade volume soared immediately after the Russian invasion in Ukraine, ""growing over 900% to over $70 million between February 19 and 24, the highest it’s been since May 2021,"" but since then the activity has only been declining, with periodic spikes, the firm wrote in a blog post.  Chainlaysis also registered a notable activity spike for ""Russian whales,"" or crypto wallets with large balances that the firm attributed to Russian users. Those wallets sent over $62 million worth of cryptocurrency to other addresses during March, mostly associated with over-the-counter (OTC) desks and exchanges, Chainalysis wrote. However, it's hard to tell what this could mean and if the spending was somehow related to sanctions evasion, the firm added.  Emigrants' money  The Russian invasion of Ukraine created a crisis both outside and inside Russia's borders. While Ukrainians are leaving their destroyed homes for Poland and other European countries, Russians are hitting the road to escape persecution for their anti-war stance, as Russia introduced draconian censorship, criminalizing any public speech about the war that deviates from the official position.  According to some estimates, as many as 200,000 Russians could have left their homes over the past month, including independent journalists, political activists, artists, IT professionals and others, who disagree with the war and aggressive anti-Ukrainian propaganda in Russia. Many of them ended up in Georgia, Armenia, Turkey and other countries that do not require visas to entry.  But there they got hit by a different kind of persecution: Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) suspended their operations in Russia, rendering debit cards of Russian banks useless abroad; payment companies like Western Union, Wise, Remitly and MoneyGram followed suit.  At the same time, Russia banned its citizens from taking more than $10,000 worth of foreign currency in cash with them as they cross the border. In addition to that, Russia banned foreign currency trading for six months on March 9.  This combination of financial censorship domestically and abroad underscores crypto as an important financial tool for the new wave of Russian emigrants, making it one of the few remaining ways to take their savings with them abroad and send money back home. Crypto will most likely get more popular among the Russian diaspora, but it will remain just one of the ""informal value transfer systems"" it will be using in the near future, Crystal said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH | BNB,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/04/11/ukraine-crisis-is-not-propelling-crypto-market-activity-blockchain-data-shows,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bd4b9a8551f48720ce3fbff524abe08c93406480-612x408.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Will buyers withhold the last stand? Key technical points: The price action forms a Doji at the 200-day EMA. The SCRT prices hinge at the $5 mark. Finally, the 24-hour trading volume of Secret is $30.73 Million, marking a 50% rise. Past Performance of SCRT SCRT prices fell by 20% in the last week, starting from the vast supply met near the $6.75 mark to the $5 mark. The downfall breaks below the 50 and 100-day EMA before clinging on to the 200-day EMA. The Doji formation at the support confluence of the 200-day EMA and the $5 mark halts the downtrend and hints at a reversal possibility. Source-Tradingview SCRT Technical Analysis The reversal possibility in the SCRT coin price must surpass $5.5 and avoid direct retracement to $5, so the price action avoids a head and shoulder formation. Hence, the $5.5 breakout will be a less risky entry opportunity for bullish traders. The flattish trend in the 50 and 100-day EMA keeps the constant threat of a bearish crossover with the struggling to sustain above the 200-day EMA.

Despite acknowledging the fact that PayPal subsidiary Venmo has already integrated Bitcoin (BTC), Wood sees &apos;it&apos;s more of a follower of Cash App.&apos; &apos;We tend to put our bets with who we believe will be the winners. As we consolidated our portfolios during a risk-off period, we chose Block (Cash App&apos;s developer company) over PayPal,&apos; Wood said in her interview. She further boasted Cash App&apos;s exploding popularity comes from its organically-driven growth in users &apos;as opposed to more of a top-down approach&apos; from Venmo. According to data from app tracker Business of Apps, Venmo currently has 70 million users and $850 million in profit in comparison to Cash App&apos;s 44 million and $2.03 billion in profit in 2021. Perhaps, the stark contrast in both the apps&apos; net profits could be another factor for Ark&apos;s decision to prefer the latter over the former.

The network has been rising in popularity as investors seek a sustainable and cost-efficient alternative to the expensive and slower blockchains. Algoracle, a project created to provide Algorand with a native oracle service was created to bootstrap the ecosystem&apos;s expansion. This can only move forward by connecting its decentralized applications (dApps) to the real world. Algoracle facilitates this process by providing the network with a decentralized bridge to connect smart contracts with real-world data. This service is critical for the expansion of any blockchain-based ecosystem. Data from Token Terminal indicates that Ethereum, one of the largest networks in terms of dApps numbers, saw an explosion in its monthly revenue. This growth was recorded from April 2020 when it stood below $1 billion to its current $14 billion. The main driver for this growth has been the adoption of its decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Conversely, these dApps require an oracle service to operate, offer a product or use case, process transactions, and onboard more users. Simply put without an oracle, there is no growth. At its yearly high, Algorand saw as many as 1.8 million active addresses. These users will support the network&apos;s next era of adoption, but they need the tools and services that will enable it.

""Elon's appointment to the board was to become officially effective [April 9], but Elon shared that same morning he will no longer be joining the board. I believe this is for the best,"" Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal confirmed in a tweet.  ""We were excited to collaborate and clear about the risks. We also believed that Elon as a fiduciary of the company where he, like all board members, has to act in the best interest of the company and all our shareholders, was the best path forward,"" Agrawal stated.  Twitter fell almost 5% in Frankfurt on Monday before recovering to trade about 3% lower, while the Stoxx 600 Europe index slipped 0.32%, and Germany's DAX fell 0.39% as of 10:28 UTC.  Agrawal added that Musk remains Twitter's biggest shareholder and that the social media company would remain open to his input. ""We have and will always value input from our shareholders whether they are on our board or not,"" he said.  Shareholders own part of a company's stock with a vested interest in its financial growth. Large shareholders, such as Musk, are usually offered a seat on the board of directors with a right to vote on how the company is controlled and conducts business.  Musk can now presumably further increase his stake in the social media giant, as one of the stipulations that came with his board seat was that he could not increase his holdings beyond 14.9%.  The CEO of electric-car maker Tesla and space exploration firm SpaceX is a staunch backer of cryptocurrencies and often turns to Twitter to publicly announce his views on crypto.  Last week's reports of his Twitter stake led to temporary spikes in crypto markets, with the likes of Dogecoin's DOGE surging as much as 10%. Crypto markets showed no immediate reaction to this morning’s announcement, however.  Musk even teased DOGE payments for Twitter services over the weekend. ""Maybe even an option to pay in Doge?,"" he said in response to a tweet about pricing for Twitter Blue, the platform's monthly subscription.  Meanwhile, Musk poked fun at Twitter's expense over the weekend. He held a poll that asked users if Twitter's San Francisco headquarters should be turned into a ""homeless shelter,"" and another that polled responses for ""Delete the w in twitter?""

Many states, eager to attract the jobs they think the industry will bring, are rushing to grant the legislative wishes of the crypto companies.  The article cited new money-transmission legislation in Florida as just the latest example of crypto industry officials working side by side with legislators to craft industry-friendly measures.  Some consumer advocates are worried that an accommodative attitude on the part of the states will lead to regulations without adequate protection from crypto scams and risky practices.  More than 150 pieces of crypto-related legislation are currently pending before state legislatures and Puerto Rico, the Times said, citing an analysis by the National Conference of State Legislatures. In some cases, legislators have used industry-suggested language almost verbatim.  In New York, the industry is spending more than $140,000 per month, the Times said, quoting state records.  While the article is notable for its overview of the growing power of the crypto industry at the state level, its publication, coming less than a month after the Times published a sophisticated and well-done introduction to cryptocurrencies, also speaks to the mainstreaming of cryptocurrency in the U.S. and a growing interest of traditional media in covering it.",NEUTRAL,없음,MARKET | REGULATION,Kevin Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/04/11/crypto-industrys-growing-sway-in-shaping-us-states-laws-ny-times,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5bb3725df64bcfef22036e07499ea43d250a3d8f-720x406.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
