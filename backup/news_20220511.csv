42423365,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2YnPh,1652312324,First Mover Asia: Bitcoin at 16-Month Low as UST Collapse Shows Risks of 'Algo' Stablecoins,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin hits its lowest point since December 2020 amid UST's implosion.  Insights: Algo stablecoins may not be such a great idea.  Technician's take: BTC is deeply oversold, but upside appears limited.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis. And sign up for First Mover,our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $28,550 -8.1%  Ether (ETH): $2,050 -12.8%  Biggest Gainers  There are no gainers in CoinDesk 20 today.  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Internet Computer ICP −30.9% Computing Polygon MATIC −28.0% Smart Contract Platform Solana SOL −27.5% Smart Contract Platform  Cryptos tumble amid LUNA implosion  Ouch.  What else was there to say about Wednesday trading in crypto markets?  Bitcoin fell to $27,700 at one point to a 16-month low before regaining some ground, but it was still part of a mass sell-off of digital assets triggered by the terraUSD (UST) stablecoin implosion against its 1:1 dollar peg.  ""It is a very nervous time in crypto markets following the collapse of the controversial stablecoin UST and as the majority of institutional crypto investors that invested last year are now losing money,"" Oanda Americas Senior Market Analyst Edward Moya wrote.  Terra blockchain LUNA token token, which was created as a buffer against the volatility of UST stablecoin plunged 96% at one point after the Luna Foundation Guard, the non-profit established to support the Terra network, moved its reserves to bitcoin exchanges to defend the dollar peg. UST dropped as low as 23 cents before recovering to 77 cents later in the day. Stable it wasn't.  Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was recently trading at $28,500, down about 7%, although it fared better than most other major cryptos, underscoring its status as a less risky option during tumultuous times for the wider digital assets market. Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, was also off, declining approximately 11% over the same period, to roughly $2,050.  The charts were even darker red and included AVAX, SOL and SAND, which recently dropped 36%, 33% and 31%, respectively. Popular meme coins SHIB and DOGE tumbled about 29% and 26%, respectively.  Equity markets shared in the misery as investors digested the latest U.S. news on inflation, which ticked slightly lower in April, but remained at four-decade highs. The prices for groceries and other consumer goods, airline travel and service industries spiked amid rising energy costs and supply chain slowdowns exacerbated by Russia's unprovoked attack on Ukraine.  The tech-focused Nasdaq sank over 3% and the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average each dropped over 1%. Meanwhile, gold, the traditional safe haven against risk, increased about 1%.  ""Today’s market reaction to the inflation report will make it hard to attract any investor who is still on the sidelines,"" Moya wrote. ""The risks on Wall Street are growing and now include a Fed policy mistake, liquidity and credit risks, and growth concerns.""  He added that bitcoin ""remains very vulnerable to further selling pressure and could see further technical selling if the $28,500 level breaks.""  Markets  S&P 500: 3,935 -1.6%  DJIA: 31,834 -1%  Nasdaq: 11,364 -3.1%  Gold: $1,852 +1%  Insights  Algorithmic stablecoins may not be such a great idea  LUNA and UST, the token and stablecoin of Singapore-based Terraform Labs, continued spiraling as UST’s key design imploded and trader sentiment around LUNA plummeted.  The impact wasn’t limited to niche regions of the internet either, as suicide helplines trended on community forums centered on Terra.  UST, a stablecoin pegged to U.S. dollars, fell to as low as 28 cents on Wednesday despite being backed by the likes of big-name crypto venture funds such as Three Arrows Capital and the Luna Foundation Guard (LFG).  The de-pegging, however, was unsurprising. Several algorithmic stablecoins have failed over the past two years and none have thrived.  Examples include Iron Finance and its TITAN tokens, Basis Cash, Empty Set Dollar, Dynamic Set Dollar and many more. These equated to millions of dollars in losses for investors.  Algorithmic stablecoins like UST are backed by a basket of assets, such as LUNA and bitcoin (BTC), without depending on any centralized third party to hold those assets. This is unlike tether and USD coin, whose parent firms claim to hold actual dollars in bank accounts to sufficiently back the values of USDT and USDC, respectively.  Tokens such as UST depend on LUNA to maintain a price of $1 using a set of on-chain mint and burn mechanics. Traders can always swap $1 worth of UST for $1 worth of LUNA and vice versa – with LUNA’s growing value serving as a shock absorber for UST's price.  However, the mechanism of algorithmically-governed stablecoins like UST makes them susceptible to the colloquial bank run.  As an example, consider Terra’s LUNA and UST tokens. A sudden fall in LUNA prices affects UST's entire stabilizing mechanism because users can no longer redeem their $1 of UST for $1 of LUNA. This creates a downward spiral as falling UST prices affect sentiment around LUNA, and a LUNA sell-off leads to lower UST prices.  A case in point is Wednesday’s price action. LUNA fell below $6 – a 96% drop since Tuesday – while UST slumped to 28 cents.  Analysts and market observers say algorithmic stablecoins remain a cause for concern now.  “Algorithmic stablecoins we see on the market today are innately brittle due to their design,” said Kate Kurbanova, cofounder of risk management platform Apostro, in a Telegram chat. “They try to hold the peg by using different algorithms, market incentives, and so on – but nevertheless, they are highly vulnerable and rely on the market and reference asset price.”  “However, such experiments work as there is a demand for stablecoins – especially when it comes to juicy APY,” Kurbanova added, reasoning their popularity.  The takeaway? Retail participants should perhaps stay away from algorithmic stablecoins that aren’t ready for prime time just yet, as the many failed experiments (and dollar losses) prove. It’s not like the crypto market isn’t enough of a risky asset class already.  Technician's take  Bitcoin Struggles Near $27K-$30K Support Zone  Bitcoin (BTC) is down by 6% over the past 24 hours and is trading at the bottom of a year-long price range. The cryptocurrency could find support between $27,000 and $30,000, although negative momentum signals point to additional breakdowns.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart is deeply oversold, similar to what occurred on Jan. 24 of this year and May 20 of last year. Still, in a downtrend, oversold conditions can persist for a few weeks before an upswing in price occurs.  On the weekly chart, the RSI is the most oversold since March 2020, which preceded a strong rally. This time, however, long-term momentum has deteriorated, suggesting limited upside beyond the upper $40,000-$45,000 resistance zone.  For now, a relief rally could be brief, especially given the strong break below $35,000 last week.

Coinbase received an amount of cash that they did not disclose in exchange for an amount of Bitcoin. &apos;Coinbase&apos;s collaboration with Goldman is the first step toward recognizing crypto as collateral,&apos; according to Brett Tejpaul, the Head of Coinbase Institutional, in an email to Bloomberg. &apos;This strengthens the connection between the fiat and cryptocurrency economies.&apos; Loans backed by Bitcoin are still appealing in comparison to more traditional banks such as Goldman Sachs. But, according to Matthew Ballensweig, managing director of Genesis, the standard terms for these loans require the borrower to put up Bitcoin worth 40 percent to 60 percent of the collateral&apos;s value. Although Goldman is new to using Bitcoin as collateral for loans, the bank did take a small step into the Bitcoin pool in March. At that time, the bank started a non-deliverable Bitcoin option, a Bitcoin derivative that pays the borrower. Galaxy Digital Holdings, a financial services company, founded by a former Goldman Sachs partner, served as the intermediary for this cryptocurrency transfer. &apos;These kinds of bilateral agreements are rarely made in a vacuum,&apos; according to an Arca report on institutional financial services firms that focuses on cryptocurrencies.

42411468,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glO5Ge,1652310092,Regulators Should Pay Attention to UST,"Over the weekend, algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD (UST) broke its peg. It broke it again on Monday and has yet to recover. Regulators may have to take a closer look at this particular model of stablecoin.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Very stable coins  The narrative  TerraUSD, a dollar-pegged algorithmic stablecoin, lost its peg twice over the past few days and hasn’t regained it since its last decoupling.  Why it matters  The UST collapse may pose a number of risks, ranging from investor/retail to institutional. While this is a relatively small-cap cryptocurrency and its footprint is relatively contained, it still has some major implications for the sector, particularly if it spooks lawmakers or regulators already concerned about stablecoin collapse.  Breaking it down  UST’s price fell to 23 cents and has a 24-hour high of 92 cents. This would be a somewhat normal amount of crypto volatility, but the added twist here is UST is supposed to be a stablecoin, meaning its price should be 1:1 to the U.S. dollar.  If you’re deep into crypto and/or have followed this story closely, go ahead and jump down to the “Outside Impact” subheading.  For new readers of this newsletter, or for those who don’t normally follow stablecoins that in depth, the idea is you have a cryptocurrency whose value is stable relative to another asset, such as the dollar, which you can then use as an intermediate unit of exchange or to buy goods and services using crypto without having to worry about market volatility.  There are a few ways to achieve this type of price stability. Stablecoins like USDT, USDC and BUSD are backed by reserves. The issuers say that for every unit of their respective stablecoin in circulation, there is a matching U.S. dollar in a bank account somewhere.  Stablecoins like the now-defunct diem (formerly libra) intended to be issued by an organization launched by Meta (formerly Facebook) would have been backed by a basket of different assets. In the original libra’s case, this would have been a basket of various currencies.  Algorithmic stablecoins are different. Rather than being backed 1:1 by dollars or other currency, the idea is you have two tokens, the stablecoin itself and a sister token that is issued (created) or burned (destroyed) as needed to maintain the stablecoin’s price.  This sister token (named terra but with the ticker LUNA; I’m just going to refer to it as LUNA for the purposes of this newsletter) can be invested in tools that make the Terra ecosystem more valuable. In theory, UST should always be redeemable for LUNA at the price of $1 per UST.  According to the Luna Foundation Guard, a Singapore-registered non-profit entity meant to support UST’s price stability, arbitraging trades is one way that LUNA can be used to maintain its peg.  “Unlike other stablecoins that are backed by fixed deposits of the pegged fiat currency or over-collateralized in another [decentralized finance] asset, the value of Terra’s family of stablecoins is maintained through a system of arbitrage incentives, open market operations, and dynamic protocol levers that maintain robust peg stability and scalability of its supply without the centralized control or capital-inefficient designs of incumbents,” the Luna Foundation Guard’s website says.  Anyways:  So, yeah, the peg broke a little bit.  It’s worth noting that the 24-hour high – 85 cents – means UST hasn’t regained its peg in over a day (since Monday, really).  Outside impacts  A lot of people lost or are losing money on UST and/or LUNA. Institutions are likely in a similar boat, and there are broader market implications as well.  LFG was rumored to be seeking up to $1.5 billion in funding to help prop up UST’s peg, even as LFG loaned close to $1.4 billion in bitcoin (BTC) for the same purpose.  So I have to imagine regulators are paying close attention. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen already brought UST up during a U.S. Senate Banking Committee hearing as a representative of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC).  “I would note that there was a report just this morning … that a stablecoin known as terraUSD had experienced a run and had declined in value,” Yellen told Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) on Tuesday. “I think that simply illustrates that this is a rapidly growing product and there are risks to financial stability and we need a framework.”  Toomey seems to disagree about the risk aspect: He told reporters on Wednesday that because UST is not backed by reserves in the same way fully backed stablecoins are, they don’t post the same kind of financial stability risk.  Still, it does seem that whatever is happening with LUNA and UST is having some influence on the broader crypto market.  The question is which regulator even has jurisdiction over this sector.  And LUNA/UST themselves, without problems, might have securities law tie-ups  Back in 2018, a project called Basis raised over $130 million to create an algorithmic stablecoin with a two-token structure, similar to LUNA and UST.  The project refunded investors after the Securities and Exchange Commission warned that the company might violate federal law if it did not limit itself to accredited investors.  As an aside, this project was resurrected in 2020 by some anonymous developers who felt that being anonymous would insulate them from regulators. One of these anonymous individuals was none other than Do Kwon, the face of the Terra ecosystem and the founder of Terraform Labs, which initially launched UST and LUNA.  What’s more, we know the SEC has Kwon on its radar – officials at the regulatory agency famously served him a subpoena during a New York conference in 2021 tied to Mirror Protocol, another project in which he’s involved.  Banking regulators or those tasked with overseeing the financial institutions that backed LUNA may also have questions, particularly if the companies under their purview are suddenly heavily down on their investments. Furthermore, there may not be any single federal regulator able to oversee some of the institutions that invested in LUNA, which could be good or bad depending on whether they’ve lost significant amounts of their investors’ money – some of the earlier investors may have made significant returns if they closed their positions out or sold any equity they may have gained through later funding rounds.  Congress will likely pay attention at some point as well.  Ron Hammond of the Blockchain Association said while stablecoins have been on Congress’s radar for a while now, all the bills addressing this sector of the crypto world have focused on asset-backed stablecoins.  “That's completely changed,” he said. “It's changed a lot of conversations.”  Algorithmic stablecoins are now definitely things lawmakers are paying attention to, but how they might approach this is unclear.  Moreover, it’s going to take some time to figure out exactly what happened, what the risks are and whether there are additional risks.  This is the type of situation that might put pressure on Congress, though just the fact that real people are getting hurt by this situation.  Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard  Lisa Cook has officially been confirmed to be a member of the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors.  Elsewhere:  In Estonia, the Party’s Over for 'Hippie' Crypto Firms: Estonia enacted a new crypto licensing law requiring local exchanges and other businesses to abide by some strict new rules, including capital reserve requirements, know-your-customer requirements and governance structures.

Typo Moves $36M in Seized JUNO Tokens to Wrong Wallet: Juno is a crypto project that airdropped tokens to investors and, in what may have been a genuinely novel governance episode, decided to penalize one airdrop recipient who may have gamed the system to gain more tokens than he should have.

On April 27, the Uzbekistan president issued a new decree. This decree altered how the National Agency for Project Management (NAPM) operates. Previously, the Uzbek government advocated for the legalization of all forms of crypto trading for its citizens. The National Agency for Prospective Projects (NAPP) of Uzbekistan will take over the NAPM&apos;s duties. The agency will then become the country&apos;s contact for all things related to crypto regulation. This is done to create a &apos;crypto regulation regime&apos; for the country. Cryptocurrency policy must be consistent across the state. In addition, the agency in charge must prevent illegal activities such as terrorist funding. In addition, the NAPP will promote projects that use blockchain and other cutting-edge technologies in government and other socio-economic sectors. The NAPP has the authority to regulate virtual asset providers such as crypto trading and mining firms that use crypto and blockchain technology. According to the decree, virtual asset service providers must pay state fees to obtain a license and be monitored by the agency.

42393835,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpBcbT,1652307171,The LUNA and UST Crash Explained in 5 Charts,"The Terra money machine collapsed almost entirely Wednesday. The UST stablecoin remains deep in the sub-dollar doldrums for the third day running, and LUNA, its sister token, has fallen almost 97% off its 2022 high. The near-complete failure of a darling of decentralized finance (DeFi) stands as an important lesson in the systemic risks of algorithmic stablecoins – crypto’s elusive Holy Grail.  Read more: What's the Point of Stablecoins? Understanding Why They Exist  Understanding why UST collapsed this past week means understanding its Achilles heel – the Anchor lending protocol.  One of the earliest signs that things were going wrong for the stablecoin came when UST deposits on Anchor started dropping Saturday.  Anchor offers market leading yields of up to 20% on the year to users who deposit their UST on the platform. Before UST started its decline late on Saturday, Anchor was home to 75% of UST's entire circulating supply. That’s $14 billion of UST out of a total circulating supply of $18 billion.  With so much UST locked up in Anchor, it became clear that most investors were buying the stablecoin with the sole intent of reaping those sweet, sweet Anchor yields. Depending on whom you ask, Anchor’s relationship with UST was either an ingenious mechanism to manufacture utility for the fledgling stablecoin, or wasteful marketing spend attracting unloyal mercenary capital.  Read more: Investors Flee Terra’s Anchor as UST Stablecoin Repeatedly Loses $1 Peg  Critics said Anchor’s high yields were unsustainable – artificially propped up by Terra builders Terraform Labs (TFL) and its big money backers. A yield decrease, they say, would’ve sent UST depositors fleeing Anchor (and UST) in search of higher returns.  The system looked similar to that of a young Uber, where venture capitalists subsidized peoples’ ride fees in a long-term bid to achieve market dominance. Instead of cheaper cab fares, inflated Anchor yields were used to pull people into the UST ecosystem – hopefully permanently. The problem, according to critics, was that TFL and its partners could only afford to subsidize investors for so long. At some point, the money would dry up, and so would Anchor’s customers (and UST’s willing holders).  Though Anchor was never forced to decrease its yield rates too significantly, UST deposits dropped sharply through the start of this week, from $14 billion to as low as $3 billion. So much money draining from UST’s primary hub signaled a massive loss in confidence in the entire Terra protocol. With few other use cases for UST beyond Anchor, most withdrawals from the platform probably ended up on the open market.  As one might expect, the massive drain from Anchor onto the open market contributed major selling pressure to the Terra ecosystem.  UST, a so-called algorithmic stablecoin, works with its sister token, LUNA, to maintain a price around $1 using a set of on-chain mint-and-burn mechanics. In theory, these mechanics are supposed to ensure $1 worth of UST can be used to mint $1 of LUNA – which serves as a sort of floating price shock absorber for UST volatility.  The massive selling pressure led to sharp drops in the prices of both LUNA and of UST. Eventually, the market cap of LUNA flipped that of UST for the first time. When there was no longer $1 worth of LUNA for every $1 of UST, some watchful traders feared the entire system might become insolvent (because UST holders would have no clear way to “cash out” into LUNA in the event of a full-scale bank run). Whether this fear was fair or not (we’ll talk in the next section about LUNA’s bitcoin backstop), it’s hard to imagine that the psychological impact of nose-diving prices and a UST-LUNA market cap “flippening” didn’t cause even further sell action.  In order to shore up UST’s price, the Luna Foundation Guard (LFG), Terra’s official peg defenders, deployed over $2 billion in its newly formed bitcoin (BTC) reserves.  Do Kwon started sweeping BTC off the market in recent months in an attempt to backstop UST, should its peg ever need defending.  In its first (and perhaps final) test of this mechanism, LFG “loaned” billions of dollars worth of reserve assets to professional market makers, draining LFG’s blockchain wallets almost entirely in the process.  Now, as LFG struggles to top up its empty reserves with new investors, market makers are on a quest to actively defend UST’s peg by deploying rescue capital on exchanges and liquidity pools.  While the rescue capital from Terra’s reserves had modest success bumping up the prices of UST and LUNA on Tuesday, the prices of both were extremely volatile leading into the early morning hours of Wednesday.  It was at this point that all bets seemed to be off for a smooth UST recovery. Even as Do Kwon announced on Twitter a UST rescue plan was in the works, market confidence in the project appeared to fall to all-time lows. At one point, LUNA – priced at over $120 earlier this year – fell below $1. UST fell below 30 cents for a brief time, leading to questions around whether the “stable” coin will ever be able regain its stability.  Read more: UST’s Do Kwon Was Behind Earlier Failed Stablecoin, Ex-Terra Colleagues Say  Much of the hundreds of millions of dollars in bitcoin used to rescue UST were likely sold straight to market early this week. Cash-outs to non-BTC currencies would have been necessary for traders hoping to defend UST’s peg.  Charts of BTC net transfer volumes tell this story, showing massive volume spikes on May 9-10 as Terra’s reserves were first deployed. While Terra doesn’t account for the entirety of these spikes, billions of dollars in freed-up Terra reserves would certainly have made an impact.  Terra’s BTC reserve dumps probably added sell-pressure to an already tumultuous market.  The impact of UST on the wider market is an important footnote amid all of this week's chaos. It stands as a reminder of why stablecoins – which form the foundation of decentralized finance – not only pose a risk to individual traders, but pose a systemic risk for the entire crypto ecosystem if not managed responsibly.

42421610,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoiJJ,1652303569,"After DeFi, DeSoc: Finding Web 3’s Soul","Web 3 has stunned the world by forging a parallel system of finance of unprecedented flexibility and creativity in less than a decade. Cryptographic and economic primitives, or building blocks, such as public key cryptography, smart contracts, proof-of-work and proof-of-stake have led to a sophisticated and open ecosystem for expressing financial transactions.  Yet, the economic value finance trades on is generated by humans and their relationships. Because Web 3 lacks primitives to represent such social identity, it has become fundamentally dependent on the very centralized Web 2 structures it aims to transcend, replicating their limitations.  Glen Weyl is a researcher in the chief technology officer’s office at Microsoft and co-author of “Radical Markets.” This article is adapted from “Decentralized Society: Finding Web 3’s Soul,” a paper he co-wrote with Puja Ahluwalia Ohlhaver, a strategist at Flashbots, and Vitalik Buterin, the co-creator of Ethereum.  For example, the lack of Web 3-native identity and reputation forces non-fungible token (NFT) artists to often rely on centralized platforms like OpenSea and Twitter (TWTR) to commit to scarcity and initial provenance, and prevents less than fully collateralized forms of lending. Distributed autonomous organizations (DAO) that try to move beyond simple coin voting often rely on Web 2 infrastructure, such as social media profiles, for resistance to Sybil attacks (one or a few entities pretending to be many more entities). And many Web 3 participants rely on custodial wallets managed by centralized outfits like Coinbase (COIN). No wonder: Decentralized key management systems are not user-friendly for any but the most sophisticated.  In our paper, we illustrate how even small and incremental steps toward representing social identity with Web 3 primitives could solve these issues and bring the ecosystem far closer to regenerating markets and their underpinning human relationships in native Web 3 context.  Even more promising, we highlight how native Web 3 social identity, with rich social composability, could yield great progress on broader, long-standing problems in Web 3 around wealth concentration and vulnerability of governance to financial attacks, while spurring a Cambrian explosion of innovative political, economic and social applications. We refer to these use cases and the richer pluralistic ecosystem they enable as “Decentralized Society” (DeSoc).  Soulbound tokens  Our key primitive is accounts that hold publicly visible, non-transferable (but possibly revocable by the issuer) tokens. We have chosen this set of properties not because they are clearly the most desirable collection of characteristics, but because they are easy to implement in the current environment and permit significant functionality.  We refer to the accounts as “Souls” and tokens held by the accounts as “Soulbound Tokens” (SBT). Despite our deep interest in privacy, we initially assume these will be publicly visible because it is technically simpler to validate as a proof-of-concept, even if limited by the subset of tokens users are willing to publicly share. Programmably private SBTs are a next step we discuss below.  Read more: The Changemaker: Glen Weyl Puts His Radical Ideas Into Action  Imagine a world where most participants have Souls that store SBTs corresponding to a series of affiliations, memberships and credentials. For example, an individual might have a Soul that stores SBTs representing educational credentials, companies they’ve worked for, hashes of works of art or books they’ve written, etc. In their simplest form, these SBTs can be “self-certified,” similar to how we share information about ourselves in our resumes. But the true power of this mechanism emerges when SBTs held by one Soul can be issued by other Souls, who are counterparties to these relationships. These counterparty Souls could be individuals, companies or institutions.  For example, a university could be a Soul that issues SBTs to graduates. A stadium could be a Soul that issues SBTs to longtime Dodgers baseball fans.  Note that there is no requirement for a Soul to be linked to a legal name, or for there to be any protocol-level attempt to ensure “one Soul per human.” A Soul could be a persistent pseudonym with a range of SBTs that cannot easily be linked. We also do not assume non-transferability of Souls across humans. Instead, we try to illustrate how these properties, where needed, can naturally emerge from the design itself.  Soul lending  Perhaps the largest financial value built directly on reputation is credit and uncollateralized lending.  Currently, the Web 3 ecosystem cannot replicate even the most primitive forms of uncollateralized lending, because all assets are transferable and saleable – thus simply forms of collateral. The traditional financial ecosystem supports many forms of uncollateralized lending, but these are often mediated by centralized credit scoring mechanisms – the rationale being that less-creditworthy borrowers have little incentive to share information about their creditworthiness.  But such scores have many flaws. At best, they opaquely overweight and underweight factors relevant to creditworthiness, and bias those who haven’t accumulated sufficient data, mainly minorities and the poor. At worst, they can enable “Black Mirror”-style opaque “social credit” systems that engineer social outcomes and reinforce discriminations.  An ecosystem of SBTs could unlock a censorship-resistant, bottom-up alternative to top-down commercial and “social” credit systems. SBTs that represent education credentials, previous work history and rental contracts, to name a few, could serve as a persistent record of credit-relevant history, allowing Souls to avoid collateral requirements by staking meaningful reputation to secure a loan. Loans and credit lines could be represented as non-transferable but revocable SBTs, so they are nested among a Soul’s other SBTs – a kind of (non-seizable) reputational collateral – until they are repaid, and subsequently burned (or, better, replaced with proof of repayment that augments the Soul’s credit history). Think of it as similar to a note on a credit history.  SBTs offer useful security properties: The property of non-transferability prevents transferring or hiding outstanding loans while the presence of a rich ecosystem of SBTs ensures that borrowers who try to escape their loans (perhaps by spinning up a fresh Soul) will lack SBTs to meaningfully stake their reputation.  The ease of computing public liabilities with SBTs would give rise to open-source lending markets. New correlations between SBTs and repayment risk would emerge, birthing better lending algorithms that predict creditworthiness and thereby reducing the role of centralized, opaque credit-scoring infrastructure. Better yet, lending would likely occur within social connections, birthing new forms of community lending. In particular, SBTs could offer a substrate for “group lending” practices similar to those pioneered by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus and the Grameen Bank, where members of a social network agree to support one another’s liabilities. Because a Soul’s constellation of SBTs represents memberships across social groups, participants could easily discover other Souls that would be valuable co-participants in a group lending project. Whereas commercial lending is a “lend-it-and-forget-it” until repayment model, community lending might take a “lend-it-and-help-it” approach, combining working capital with human capital with greater rates of return.  Not losing your soul  The non-transferability of key SBTs – such as one-time issued education credentials – raises an important question: How do you not lose your Soul? Recovery methods today, like muti-signature recovery or mnemonics, have different trade-offs in mental overhead, ease of transacting and security. Social recovery is an emerging alternative that relies on a person’s trusted relationships. SBTs allow a similar, but broader paradigm: community recovery, where the Soul is the intersectional vote of its social network.  Social recovery is a good starting point for security but has several drawbacks in security and usability. A user curates a set of “guardians'' and gives them the power, by majority, to change the keys of a wallet. Guardians could be a mix of individuals, institutions or other wallets. The problem is a user must balance the desire for a reasonably high number of guardians against the precaution that guardians be from discrete social circles to avoid collusion. Also, guardians can pass away, relationships sour or people simply fall out of touch, requiring frequent and attention-taxing updates. While social recovery avoids a single point of failure, successful recovery depends on curating and maintaining trusted relationships with a majority of your guardians.  A more robust solution is to tie Soul recovery to a Soul’s memberships across communities, not curating but instead drawing on a maximally broad set of real-time relationships for security. Recall that SBTs represent memberships to different communities. Some of these communities – like employers, clubs, colleges, or churches – might be more off-chain in nature, while others – like participation in a protocol governance or DAO – might be more on-chain. In a community recovery model, recovering a Soul’s private keys requires a member from a qualified majority of a (random subset of) Soul’s communities to consent. As with social recovery, we assume that the individual has access to secure, off-chain communications channels broader than the chain itself where “authentication” (through conversation and sharing of shared secrets) can take place. We can often think of the relationships tokenized by SBTs as being precisely the access to such channels.  Maintaining and recovering cryptographic possession of a Soul requires consent of the Soul’s network. By embedding security in sociality, community recovery deters Soul theft (or sale). A Soul can always regenerate their keys through community recovery. Thus, any attempt to sell a Soul will lack credibility because a Seller would also need to prove they sold the recovery relationships.  Programmable plural privacy  Most valuable data isn’t necessarily individual, but interpersonal (e.g., social graph) or valuable only when pooled in larger groups (e.g., health data). Yet, “self-sovereign identity” advocates tend to treat data as private property: Data about this interaction is mine and so I should be able to choose when and to whom to reveal it. But even more than in the physical economy, the data economy is poorly understood in terms of simple private property. Even in simple two-way relationships, such as an illicit affair, the right to reveal information is usually symmetrical, often requiring mutual-permission and consent. The Cambridge Analytica scandal was largely about people revealing properties of their social graph and information about their friends, without their consent.  Rather than privacy-as-transferable-property-right, a more promising approach is to treat privacy as a programmable, loosely coupled bundle of rights to permission access, alter or profit from information. Every SBT – whether the SBT represents an affiliation, membership, credential or access to a facility – also has an implied programmable property right specifying access to the underlying information constituting the SBT: the holders, the agreements between them, the shared property or assets and obligations to 3rd parties, to name a few. Some issuers and communities will choose to make SBTs wholly public, like SBTs that reflect information in a public resume. Some SBTs will be private in the atomistic sense of verifiable credentials. Most will be somewhere in between, revealing some information publicly and keeping some information private while sharing some information to a designated subset.  SBTs enable privacy as a programmable, composable property right that can map upon the complex set of expectations and agreements we have today. Better yet, SBTs also help us imagine new configurations, as there are an infinite number of ways privacy – as a property right to permission access to information – can be composed to create a nuanced constellation of access rights.  For example, SBTs could enable holders to run computations over data stores, perhaps owned and governed by a collective of Souls, using a specific privacy preserving technique. Some SBTs may even grant permission to access data in a way where computation is possible across data stores, but the contents can only be proven with a third party’s permission. This could be useful for SBTs that instantiate and represent “continuous voting” mechanisms, where the voting mechanism needs to tally votes from every Soul, but votes should not be provable to anyone else to prevent vote buying.  SBTs could steward healthier forms of the “attention economy” that empower Souls to filter spam inbounds from likely bots outside of their social graph, while elevating communication from real communities and desired intersections. This would be a dramatic improvement on communication platforms today, which lack user control or governance and auction user attention to the highest ad bidder, even a bot. Listeners could become more aware of to whom they are listening, and be better able to assign credit to works that spur insights.  Rather than optimizing for engagement, such an economy could optimize for positive-sum collaborations and valuable contributions.  Albert Einstein told the 1932 disarmament conference that the failures of the “organizing power of man” to keep pace with “his technical advances"" had put a “razor in the hands of a 3-year-old child.” In a world where his observation seems more prescient than ever, learning how to program futures that build on trust – rather than replacing it – seems a required course for human life on this planet to persist.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Glen Weyl,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/05/11/after-defi-desoc-finding-web-3s-soul,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/73ca0d5e0e7f968b3859e7479e1757f8fbb9e116-5616x3744.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Likewise, the largest and most popular cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, also continues to lose its value. The coin has consecutively dropped since the year 2022 has turned. Per the statistics provided by Tradingview.com, the market value of the giant Bitcoin was fledging around $883.89 billion on January 1. However, after the continuous downtrend in the value, its market capitalization as of May 10 stands around $568.55 billion.

That $15.2 million in revenue also slipped 24% from $20 million the previous quarter, but was up more than five-fold from $2.8 million a year earlier, according to the earnings release.  Fiscal third quarter adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) of $7.3 million also missed the average analyst estimate of $9.6 million, while falling 49% from $14.3 million last quarter. EBITDA margin fell to 48% from 72% the prior quarter and 57% a year ago, in part thanks to higher corporate costs following November’s initial public offering as well as expenses associated with the company’s expansion plans.  Iris mined 357 bitcoins in the quarter, down 2% from the previous quarter and up 449% from a year ago. Positive cash flow from operations for the quarter was $4.6 million  The company also took note of continued progress in its plans to expand to 15 EH/s of installed capacity, with work taking place across four data center sites.

Terra's LUNA token plunged for the third consecutive day, declining by as much as 96% over the past 24 hours. LUNA was meant to be a buffer against volatility for the stablecoin TerraUSD (UST), but it has succumbed to extreme selling pressure. The Luna Foundation Guard moved the entirety of its reserves to bitcoin exchanges to defend its UST stablecoin’s 1:1 dollar peg on Wednesday.  Just launched!

Further, the European Commission is considering a ban on large-scale stablecoins, which have become widely used in place of fiat currency, according to a document seen by CoinDesk.  Bitcoin (BTC) declined by as much as 6% over the past 24 hours, compared with a 9% decline in ether (ETH) and a 30% decline in Solana's SOL token. Bitcoin is outperforming most alternative cryptos (altcoins), which typically occurs in a down market because of its lower risk profile relative to smaller tokens.

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Bitcoin's trading volume has ticked higher over the past few days, albeit by less than in previous spikes. That could be an initial sign of capitulation as BTC stabilizes at about $30,000.  ""The volume surge is especially interesting considering the dwindling spot volumes we have seen during the latest month, as April saw the lowest bitcoin spot volumes since last summer,"" Arcane Research wrote in a report earlier this week. ""The recent uptick in volatility seems to have woken up traders.""  Volatility returns  BTC's front-month implied volatility also spiked to its highest level since March. Traders are expecting greater price swings over the short term, although volatility spikes tend to be short-lived.  QCP Capital, a Singapore-based crypto trading firm, noted large amounts of put demand from its option trading desk this week, which pushed BTC and ETH risk reversals (calls minus puts) even more negative from -8% to -15%. QCP expects more volatility over the short term.  The chart below shows a rise in BTC's put/call ratio, which suggests bearish sentiment among option traders. The ratio is at its highest level since February, which preceded an upswing in price.  Further, open interest in bitcoin's perpetual swaps market surged to a new high on Tuesday. That suggests an increase in leverage among derivative traders, which typically leads to sharp price swings – a relief rally or breakdown.  Still, the cost to fund long positions (funding rate) remains neutral, which means some traders are still willing to increase exposure to BTC despite the current stress. Typically, funding rates collapse during sell-offs.  Altcoin roundup  Terra to the ground: The Terra blockchain’s native token, LUNA, plunged to as low as $1, shedding 96% of its value in just a day. LUNA is supposed to absorb price shocks of the blockchain algorithmic stablecoin, TerraUSD (UST), but UST’s failure to regain its $1 peg made LUNA virtually worthless.

42423349,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2Ymxh,1652300313,'$DAI Will Die' Tweet Twisted Back on Terra's Kwon as UST Loses $1 Peg,"Just two months ago, Do Kwon, the founder of the Terra blockchain, tweeted to his followers that DAI, a five-year-old stablecoin, would succumb to the fast-rising growth of Terra's stablecoin, UST.  Fast forward to this week, and it's UST, not DAI, that needs a lifeline.  The algorithmic stablecoin hosted by the Terra Network lost its dollar peg twice this week, falling to as low as 23 cents on Wednesday. As a stablecoin, the price of UST is supposed to keep a value of $1 at all times.  Because of that price drop, DAI, which is built on the Ethereum blockchain, briefly surpassed UST as the biggest stablecoin by market capitalization based on a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, and the fourth largest of all stablecoins.  DAI, which is maintained by the decentralized finance protocol MakerDAO, currently has a market cap of $7.54 billion (with a price holding fast to the $1 peg), while UST was briefly at $6.43 billion on Wednesday, according to data from Messari, before rebounding to $12.9 billion in the afternoon.  But there’s still a long way to go before the algorithmic stablecoin reaches its original market cap of around $18 billion, which is what it was before the crash that started three days ago.  In the meantime, the schadenfreude on Twitter was palpable on Wednesday:  Representatives of Do Kwon have not responded to a request for comment as of press time.  DAI is a dollar-pegged stablecoin, meaning that its value is backed by dollars as opposed to using on-chain mint-and-burn mechanics. But both stablecoins operate in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, which is why they are often compared.  DAI is maintained by MakerDAO.  Do Kwon has said he was working on bringing the UST stablecoin back to a $1 value, and tweeted early Wednesday that he was working to ""rebuild UST."" It was trading at 58 cents at press time, still 33% down over the past 24 hours.  For what it's worth ""Do Kwon"" was trending on Twitter on Wednesday.

42421595,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoi7x,1652300261,Do Kwon Is the Elizabeth Holmes of Crypto,"“And on the pedestal, these words appear:  “Your size is not size.”  LUNA, the token that was meant to algorithmically balance the TerraUSD “stablecoin,” is trading as I write this at about $1.92 – down 94% since yesterday. It has dipped to as low as 70 cents. TerraUSD (UST) was recently trading at about 67 cents.  This means the Terra/Luna “experiment” is almost certainly over. The chances that the system will restabilize, and TerraUSD will regain its peg naturally are near zero, because the entire structure was based on external subsidies and those funders may have finally wised up. Do Kwon likely won’t get another bailout.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  It is impossible not to contemplate what is going through Kwon’s head as he surveys the wreckage of what just days ago had the outlines of a nascent empire. There have been few falls as sudden and humbling in business history, or even in public life more generally.  But one downfall that came close was Elizabeth Holmes’.  Self-deception is the most effective kind  Once a cover subject for glossy business magazines that hailed her to the sky as a revolutionary, the founder and CEO of Theranos is now a 38-year-old pariah, doomed to spend the rest of her life as synonymous with deception and moral weakness as Enron’s Jeffrey Skilling and Kenneth Lay.  Skilling, Holmes and Kwon also have deeper commonalities. Crypto longtimers are well familiar with the main line of financial scams in the sector, mostly short cons like rug pulls and lazy lies about nonexistent partnerships. You learn to recognize the energy of such cynical operators, the glint in their eye that reveals their hole card.  Kwon stands out because that glint was never so obvious – like with Skilling and Holmes, it seems plausible he actually believed his own come-on. Despite reams of critical appraisals of the fundamental structure of Luna, Kwon not only stayed the course, but over the last 24 hours has angled to find more capital to flush through the holes in his sinking flagship. He’s nowhere near acknowledging that he put the holes there when he built it. At the very least, he’s doing a great impression of a man who really believes in what he’s selling.  See also: UST's Do Kwon Was Behind Failed Stablecoin Basis Cash  This matters immensely because there will inevitably be major lawsuits and even criminal prosecutions around the collapse of luna. The defense in those cases will almost certainly try and convince judges and juries (very much plural) that Kwon really believed in the project and that its failure was an honest shortfall, not a lengthy and complex deception.  The same argument was central to the Elizabeth Holmes criminal trial, which ended in January. Holmes founded her company at age 19 on the idea that blood testing could be miniaturized. But she had no real technological insights into how that might be accomplished, and what ensued was a multiyear series of compounding failures, evasions and deceptions. Holmes’ lawyers tried to argue that she had acted ineptly, but a jury found her guilty of fraud.  Do Kwon was not 19 when he launched TerraUSD, but in his late twenties. Nonetheless, he similarly promised investors something extremely cool and useful – a decentralized stablecoin – without a novel, or even sophisticated, approach to actually building one. In fact, he basically copy-pasted the tokenomics of projects that had already failed and that close observers warned for months would fail again under the Luna brand. Then it did fail - in May 2021, when TerraUSD’s market cap was just $2 billion.  Kwon essentially dismissed that first, smaller failure as an irrelevant glitch and made no real changes. Holmes, following similar motivated reasoning, faked early test demonstrations on the basis that she was so certain her technology would eventually work that papering over its present failure wasn’t actually lying. Kwon went on to defend his supposed innovation with such passion and vitriol that people gave him tens of billions of dollars, growing the paper value of LUNA to $40 billion and TerraUSD’s market cap to more than $18 billion.  What happened next was seemingly inevitable. But did Do Kwon himself understand that?  Primitive minds  Freudian psychology is crucial to understanding this combination of conviction and fragility. The basic Freudian insight is that we don't really have full control of our behavior, that our conscious minds are often simply rationalizing behaviors that are actually guided by our unconscious desires. This is one general way to understand people’s tendency to double down on things that are obviously not true: Impulsive and impassioned people can’t easily modify their behavior to accord with even the most obvious reason.  So while they may on some level “know” that they’ve failed or made a mistake, these folks instead often just yell louder – what Freud might have called a reaction formation. In this habit of mind, a threatening or dangerous thought is pushed away by loudly, publicly declaring its exact opposite. When Elizabeth Holmes led her entire staff in a chant of “F**k you, Carreyrou!” after Wall Street Journal reporter John Carreyou's first expose on the fraudulent company, she wasn't just putting on a public performance – she was pushing away her own sneaking suspicion that she was a fraud.  Do Kwon showed exactly the same sort of reaction formation in the year leading up to this week’s meltdown. After the May 2021 depeg, he referred to his critics as “cockroaches.” In November, he referred to a detailed hypothetical description of the attack that occurred this week as “the most retarded thread I’ve read this decade.” When two threads in January sought to explain Luna’s fragility, Kwon personally called the analysts “idiot,” “stupid” and “dumbass.”  To those attuned to human perversity, such vitriol is a huge red flag, a sign to tread very cautiously. But anger is a confoundingly good marketing tactic when it comes to the less-reflective masses. Anger attracts attention – that’s why social media sites have been caught fostering anger to drive more user engagement. Supporters, or even mere onlookers, may see such outbursts as the understandable frustration of a victim getting a raw deal.  But anger can distort our reasoning, and some research has specifically found that it tends to increase confirmation bias by boosting self-confidence. In other words, when you’re angry – including when someone tells you to be angry – you’re more likely to think you’re right, and less likely to ask difficult questions.  Empires can be built on that kind of unquestioning conviction. But they will always be haunted by their blindness at the edges – and as we saw this week, that’s usually where the death blow comes from.  The power and the glory  Kwon is similar to Holmes in at least one other way: He knew, whether out of Machiavellian insight or low animal cunning, that getting big names into his project would legitimize it in the eyes of other speculators. Elizabeth Holmes courted big-name board members like Henry Kissinger, George Schultz and James Mattis – notably, people with a lot of public credibility but very little knowledge of biosciences. Those backers were key to vaulting her into the limelight, and then keeping the Theranos fraud going.  Scrutiny over the last few days has highlighted just how much big-name support Kwon and Terra had. Where a low-rent exit scam might have hired a few celebrity shills, Kwon attracted reputable names to his cap table, garnering investments from the likes of Coinbase Ventures, Pantera Capital and perhaps most significantly Jump Trading, a longtime traditional equity trading firm that recently dove into crypto.  All of those entities should take time in the coming days to address their involvement in the project, whose fundamentals were so questionable it could become a black eye not only for its founder but for the crypto industry. Some backed Terraform Labs – the development team that built Terra-based tools and applications like the Mirror and Anchor protocols – rather than Luna/UST specifically, and should defensively clarify that if so.  Occam’s razor suggests some big-name investors weren’t necessarily driven by Terra’s fundamentals. Notoriously, discounts for early backers and short lockup periods can mean venture capitalists make plenty of money even when a crypto project fails. And even if these funds did in some sense believe in the project, that faith might have been premised more on Kwon’s blustering, made-for-2022 persona than on Terra’s technological potential.  That raises a final possible parallel to Holmes: Some have made the argument that she was to a degree herself a victim of the Silicon Valley funding machine. Some venture capitalists, the logic goes, saw the marketing potential of her story and image, but avoided scrutinizing her abilities and ideas. As dramatized in the Hulu series “The Dropout,” this made Holmes little more than a tool for generating alpha, to be cast aside if and when anything went wrong. Do Kwon, certainly, will come out of this more grievously damaged than any of the big shops that gave him money.  See also: Crisis in Terra's UST Stablecoin Spreads to Neutrino USD  Whatever their motives, these investors likely facilitated the sudden and huge run-up in retail participation in TerraUSD over the past year. It’s a dynamic that’s unique to crypto, because retail investors can’t usually access equity in the private companies that venture capitalists fund in traditional markets. In some ways, it’s a no-win situation: VCs are tuned for frequent failure, and so they can’t be held particularly responsible when average Janes follow them into a wrongheaded bet. Nonetheless, ethical crypto VCs may want to take a more responsible approach, given their power to signal confidence without always disclosing risks.  For professional investors who were truly taken in by Do Kwon – his grandstanding, his anger and all the rest – it may be time for even more serious self-reflection.",NEGATIVE,LUNA,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | LUNA | MARKET | TRADING,David Z.

42423386,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2Yu7h,1652299397,Grayscale Had ‘Productive’ Meeting With SEC on Bitcoin ETF Conversion,"Grayscale Investments LLC recently met with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to better make its case for turning the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).  “Following a productive meeting, we remain encouraged by our ongoing engagement with the SEC,” a Grayscale spokesperson told CoinDesk. “At Grayscale, we intend to maintain an open dialogue with regulators and policymakers as we look ahead to July 6.”  Grayscale’s parent company Digital Currency Group is also the owner of CoinDesk, which is run as an independent subsidiary.  Grayscale in October 2021 initially applied to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into a spot ETF. The SEC has since pushed off a decision, but currently plans to render a verdict by July 6.  In a presentation made to the SEC at the recent meeting, Grayscale said converting its marquee product into an ETF would “protect investors and the public interest, allowing the product to better track net asset value while giving investors the freedom to invest in Bitcoin in a safe and secure manner.”  Additionally, said Grayscale, an ETF vehicle instead of the current trust structure would “allow better NAV tracking, reduce discounts and premiums, and unlock approximately $8B for investors.”  The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust – currently with about $20 billion in assets under management – has been known to trade at wide premiums/discounts to net asset value, and currently sells for a 27% discount to NAV.  Giving some hope to spot bitcoin ETF fans, the SEC in April approved a futures-based fund from Teucrium. What made this approval different than other futures-based ETFs was that its application was under the “33 Act” and ""34 Act"" (the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934). The previous bitcoin (BTC) ETF approvals had been under the “40 Act” (the Investment Company Act of 1940).  Providing context, Grayscale Chief Legal Officer Craig Salm told CoinDesk last month that the Teucrium advancement showed the SEC as comfortable not just with ETFs regulated under the 40 Act, but also the 33 and 34 Acts, which is what spot bitcoin ETFs would be regulated under.  Additionally, asset manager Bitwise has a spot bitcoin ETF application pending review with the SEC, with a final deadline of June 29. While declining to address the fund’s specific chances of being approved, Matt Hougan, Bitwise’s chief investment officer, in April told CoinDesk “we’re making progress.""

The firm, which manages $500 million in assets, told its limited partners in a note sent out Tuesday it believed Terra’s teetering UST stablecoin would eventually regain its peg and concluded the situation created a buying opportunity.  Arca said in the note it held an ad hoc investment and risk committee meeting to discuss the situation. On Monday night, UST had fallen to a low of 63 cents and LUNA was trading at $24.60; as of press time on Wednesday, UST was still languishing well below $1 at 63 cents and LUNA had tanked below $1.15, according to CoinGecko.  “After this analysis, we felt, and continue to feel, that UST will ultimately maintain its peg and a number of attractive opportunities had become available,” Arca CEO Rayne Steinberg wrote to investors on Tuesday. “For example, we were able to purchase UST at a significant discount to par in the DYF (Digital Yield Fund) and then deposit with FTX who were paying 100% APY (annual percentage yield) given the buyer/seller imbalance during peak fear.”  Arca declined to comment. FTX, a crypto exchange, didn't reply to a request for comment.  Arca runs a Digital Assets Fund, in which LUNA is a core holding, according to the note. UST, meanwhile, is a core stablecoin in the firm’s Digital Yield Fund, the firm said in the letter. Galaxy Digital’s Vision Hill unit is an anchor investor in Arca. Galaxy boss Mike Novogratz famously inked a prominent LUNA tattoo on his left arm in January.  “We have significant experience in distressed situations from 2008/2009 up to and including SUSHI and LEO (Bitfinex) in recent years,” Steinberg wrote in the note, referring to past crises. “We welcome these opportunities to be buyers when others are fearful.”",POSITIVE,LUNA | LEO,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | LUNA | LEO,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/05/11/crypto-fund-arca-doubled-down-on-ust-amid-stablecoins-collapse,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/70397172bd53a8f51214185f9c1819e1f023abe9-1600x1067.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411810,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glg6TV,1652299114,What Is NFT Lending?,"Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) continue to be a popular asset class in crypto. But NFTs aren’t only for buying, selling and holding. Just like other assets, they can be part of more complex and lucrative financial arrangements.  The need for financial instruments in the NFT market stems from a significant problem. While you can sell bitcoin pretty much instantly, the NFT market is far more illiquid. It could take months until someone buys your NFT.  And when you sell your NFT, you have to sell the whole thing. Lots of people don’t want to part with their NFTs forever – not even parts of it, as would be the case with NFT fractionalization.  These problems explain why NFT lending has become the latest sector to emerge and has become even more popular with NFT marketplace Blur's entry into the space, Blend. NFT lending solves the problem of low liquidity in NFTs while encouraging more people to invest in the NFT market by lowering the cost of entry.  The sector is structured around a few models:  Peer-to-peer NFT lending  Peer-to-protocol NFT lending  Non-fungible debt positions  NFT rentals  Remember that financial investment in NFTs and decentralized finance (DeFi) – or the intersection of both as in this case – presents a myriad of risks, including sudden downturns in the cryptocurrency market, smart contract exploits and regulatory crackdowns. Although many of these platforms are audited, an audit doesn’t guarantee safety, it only points out the errors in a platform’s code as far as the auditor can spot.  Read More: The Risks of DeFi Lending  Peer-to-peer NFT lending  The first kind of NFT lending replicates the classic model of a lending marketplace: matching lenders with borrowers.  NFTfi is one popular peer-to-peer NFT lending platform. When you list your NFT as collateral on the platform, you receive loan offers from others. If you like any of the offers, you can accept one and immediately receive wrapper ether (WETH) or DAI (a stablecoin) from the lending user’s wallet. As part of the loan agreement, the platform automatically transfers your NFT into a digital vault – an escrow smart contract – for the duration of the loan.  You get your NFT back into your wallet when you repay the loan before the expiration date. If you default on your loan, the lender will receive your NFT at a huge discount. Drastic changes in an NFT collection’s floor price don’t affect the loan terms; it’s a peer-to-peer deal with its own terms.  Here’s an actual example of an NFTfi loan. Someone who bought Bored Ape Yacht Club #8646 for 0.55 ETH a year ago has collateralized the NFT for 90 days. The lender provided a loan of 45 WETH to the NFT owner on May 7. And by Aug. 5, the lender received either 48.328767 wETH (that’s a 30% annual percentage rate) or if the NFT owner had defaulted, the collateralized NFT. At the time of writing, NFT appraisal platform Upshot values the collateralized Bored Ape NFT at 123.63564 ETH, and another appraisal platform NFTBank values it at 147.29025 ETH.  NFTfi charges lenders 5% on the interest earned on successful loans (no fee in case of a loan default). Borrowers use the platform with no service fee.  Arcade (formerly Pawn.fi) is another popular peer-to-peer NFT lending platform.  Arcade allows users to wrap multiple NFTs – such as several CryptoPunks – into one wrapped NFT that can be collateralized as a single asset. The platform offers more flexibility in borrowing terms than NFTfi does. You can indicate with ERC-20 tokens what you would be willing to accept, for example.  There have been several recent entries to the NFT lending landscape, most notably Blend, which recorded $308 million in trading volume in its first 22 days in May 2023.  Peer-to-protocol NFT lending  While peer-to-peer NFT lending allows for customizable loan terms, peer-to-protocol NFT lending platforms allow you to borrow directly from the protocol.  Similar to DeFi lending protocols, these NFT lending platforms rely on liquidity providers adding crypto funds to a protocol pool. Borrowers can access liquidity immediately after collateralizing their NFTs and locking them up in the protocol’s smart contract-powered digital vaults.  BendDAO is a popular platform that functions under the peer-to-protocol model. The protocol had around 1,000 NFTs collateralized in May 2022, including 273 Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs.  The platform uses Chainlink oracles – which are bridges connecting blockchains to data streams – to get the floor price information from OpenSea, the most popular NFT trading platform. BendDAO liquidates collateralized NFTs when the floor price in the collection falls below a certain health factor, which takes into account the market value of the NFT collateral and the borrowed amount. But there’s a 48-hour wait period before any liquidation happens, giving the NFT owner a chance to rescue their beloved NFT from slipping away from their hands.  Read More: What Are Blockchain Bridges?  Pine is another peer-to-protocol platform that lets borrowers take out ether (ETH), solana (SOL) or stablecoins against their NFT collaterals. The platform lets in more NFT collections than BendDAO does.  With the platform's current form, users will lose their NFT only if they don't repay by the expiration date. But in the next version of Pine, users will face liquidation because of poor ""health"" factors, similar to how BendDAO operates. The platform also promises a “thorough borrower protection plan” in the future.  Non-fungible debt position  MakerDAO, which is one of the oldest platforms in DeFi, is famous for its collateralized debt position (CDP) structure, which lets borrowers take out the stablecoin DAI when they collateralize ETH.  Following a similar model, JPEG’d offers non-fungible debt positions. The platform, which had a total value locked (TVL) of 4,846 ETH in its smart contracts in May 2022, lets users collateralize whitelisted blue-chip NFTs like CryptoPunks and borrow a synthetic stablecoin, $PUSd, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar on a 1:1 basis.  As a borrower, you can use $PUSd to provide liquidity on the protocol and earn interest or you can swap it for other cryptocurrencies to seek opportunities elsewhere. And when you repay the loan, you can take back control of your NFT.  Similar to peer-to-pool lending platforms like BendDAO, JPEG’d uses Chainlink oracles to keep tabs on the market price of its NFT collaterals.  Renting out NFTs  A final category is NFT rentals, where reNFT is a popular platform. It’s a permissionless market for potential renters and tenants with varying rental terms and conditions.  Instead of locking up NFT collaterals in a digital vault, the protocol facilitates peer-to-peer NFT rentals where the asset transfers from one wallet to another wallet for the duration of “tenancy.” As a tenant of a rented NFT, you receive full access to token-gated perks like Discord servers or whitelist giveaways made available to the holders of certain NFTs.  Although for NFT owners the protocol allows access to liquidity, the motives aren’t necessarily about earning yields for those who buy a ""tenancy"" – in fact, they pay for the privilege of access and crypto credibility. In one case of a three-month CryptoPunk rental last year, for example, the tenant saw his “[social-media] engagement skyrocket and has made a full name for himself in the space.”  Read More: Binance Launching NFT Loan Feature",POSITIVE,ETH | DAI,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | DAI,Ekin Genç,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/what-is-nft-lending,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/70b6f612629092371f2e10174a1155becbaf66cf-1851x1388.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The &apos;fear and greed index&apos; is an indicator that tells us about the general sentiment among investors in the Bitcoin market. The index uses a numeric scale that runs from one to hundred for representing the sentiment. All values above the &apos;50&apos; point signify greed, while those below the cutoff imply the market is fearful right now. Values towards the end of the range of above 75 and below 25 indicate sentiments of extreme greed and extreme fear, respectively. Historically, bottoms have tended to form during periods of extreme fear while tops have occurred when the market is extremely greedy.

Officials appear to be siding with the views of European Union finance ministers, who have proposed tough measures aimed at stopping the likes of Facebook's now-abandoned libra stablecoin from replacing the euro, and require issuance to halt if transactions top 1 million per day. Two individuals familiar with discussions confirmed the details.  The document is labeled as a “non-paper,” meaning it does not reflect the commission’s formal position, and is one of a number documents being produced to influence discussions on topics such as whether crypto firms should be able to register from tax havens.  Lawmakers and governments are attempting to finalize the landmark crypto law known as the Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA), with late-stage talks behind closed doors that are brokered by the commission.  National ministers, who meet in a body known as the Council of the EU, want to stop rivals to fiat from operating if they become too popular. Under their plans, regulators could order the issuers of any stablecoin exceeding 200 million euros (US$211 million) and 1 million transactions daily to cease issuances until these figures come back below the threshold.  The European Parliament favors a softer approach that would see successful stablecoins reclassified and subject to oversight by the European Banking Authority.  “The Commission services prefer the Council text that limits the issuance of ARTs [asset referenced tokens],” the document said, warning that the parliament’s approach of forcing issuers to repay customers what they originally paid for the token would lead to financial engineering that could endanger stability.  “The thresholds for monitoring and limiting ARTs widely used as a means of payment could be further discussed at political level,” the document said. The Commission does favor having extra measures triggered by specific numerical limits, rather than leaving it to regulators’ discretion.  MiCA introduces measures to ensure crypto assets are well governed, honestly offered to investors and have decent reserves, particularly when they reach significant scale. The extra proposals would apply to widely used stablecoins that are tied to a basket of assets, rather than those fixed to an individual fiat currency such as the euro.

42423372,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2Ytnh,1652291796,Bitcoin Miner Argo Blockchain 'Leans Toward' Designing Custom Miners With Intel Chips,"Bitcoin (BTC) mining firm Argo Blockchain (ARBK) is “leaning toward” designing its own machines using Intel’s chips, and working with a third-party manufacturer to bring them to life, the firm’s CEO Peter Wall told CoinDesk in an interview.  The Intel chips are expected to break the duopoly of Bitmain and MicroBT, which are dominating the mining application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) market.  More than that, Wall’s interview with CoinDesk shows how they can give miners the opportunity to design their own machines, instead of having to settle for ready-made ones from manufacturers.  Read more: Argo Blockchain Borrows $70M From NYDIG to Buy Mining Rigs  Argo is one of a handful of companies that will be buying Intel’s new bitcoin mining ASICs, the other three being Jack Dorsey’s Block (SQ), Hive Blockchain (HIVE) and Griid Infrastructure.  The firm had already said it would be deploying “custom-designed mining machines utilizing Intel's state-of-the-art ASIC Blockscale chips” in its annual earnings report for 2021, but hadn’t specified exactly how they would be designed and produced.  There are two options as to how bitcoin miners can operationalize Intel’s chips, Wall said. The first is to “get the chips” and then “work with your own third-party manufacturer to design and build a machine to your liking,” he said. The second is to work with manufacturers recommended by Intel to build the bitcoin mining rigs, he said.  Given Argo’s history, which shows that their “preference is always to have more control and more customization,” the company is leaning towards the first option, which is to “be able to build our own custom rigs,” Wall said.  Customizing bitcoin mining machines  Asked about specific aspects of customization, the CEO mentioned “form factors” and customizing bitcoin mining rigs for immersion versus air cooling. Immersion cooling is a technology in which machines are immersed in liquid that doesn’t conduct electricity, in order to be cooled down, as opposed to using tools like fans.  By customizing the mining machines, Argo can also control “a lot more of the software side of things” which is “a huge advantage ... particularly in the immersion environment,” Wall said.  The Argo CEO said that more details will come out in the next few weeks.  There are three “Ms” that matter in bitcoin mining: money, megawatts and machines, Wall said. Miners have been innovating with the first two, coming up with innovative financing solutions and working more closely with energy producers, so it only makes sense if eventually they start addressing the machines part of the equation, he said.  Over time “other miners are going to realize that this is the direction to go,” meaning customized machines, according to the CEO.  A key roadblock for customizing bitcoin mining rigs so far has been the chip manufacturers. Existing industry players like Bitmain and MicroBT tend to keep their designs and even supply chain under wraps. “You need a chip manufacturer that is willing to play ball, and that's what's cool with Intel is that they're really just interested in selling chips,” Wall said.  However, to pull off making customized bitcoin miners, firms need a lot of technical expertise, as well as experience in mining, chips and firmware, he said.  At the end of the day, “the proof is in the pudding,” Wall said. Just like Argo’s Helios mine, which finally started operating this week after more than nine months of construction, only when the results of their machine customization efforts are tangible will the firm be able to say, “it was hard, but we did it.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Eliza Gkritsi,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/05/11/bitcoin-miner-argo-blockchain-leans-toward-designing-custom-miners-with-intel-chips,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d1d39fd77a8244e0f4ab7499bf8cb1b18bb921e1-2911x1940.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42423376,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2Ytjh,1652291056,UST Meltdown Hasn't Spurred US Financial Stability Council Meeting: Sources,"The sudden meltdown of an investment firm or money market fund often spurs U.S. government officials to action, with regulators gathering on urgent calls to decide whether and how to intervene. As one of crypto world’s major stablecoins – TerraUSD (UST) – slid toward disaster this week, it hasn’t triggered any such meetings.  Despite the recent federal stance that stablecoins could pose a rising threat to the U.S. financial system, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) hasn’t gathered to weigh the potential hazards from UST, according to two people with knowledge of the situation. Though the panel of agency chiefs hasn’t met as a group, the Treasury Department and top financial regulators are monitoring the plummet of the dollar-pegged algorithmic stablecoin – which at one point Wednesday sold for a quarter.  The situation even warranted a mention from U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in a Tuesday hearing in the Senate. Yellen, who leads the FSOC, said the token was experiencing a run that “illustrates that this is a rapidly growing product, and that there are risks to financial stability.”  A Treasury spokesman declined to comment on any internal discussions regarding UST.  Dollar-pegged stablecoins – the core assets whose steady values are meant to allow investors to reliably trade in and out of more volatile cryptocurrencies – typically hew to the price of a dollar, much like money market funds’ promise to give back at least a dollar for each one invested (though they additionally provide a small return over time, unlike stablecoins).  When the Reserve Primary Fund infamously “broke the buck” in the 2008 financial meltdown, the implosion of a major money market fund was a doomsday event that panicked the financial world. In the end, its slide took it down to $0.97 a share, though the failed fund eventually returned about $0.99 to its investors after a government intervention.  There are two significant reasons UST’s plight isn’t forcing a government response: the relatively small scale of the industry and the fact that oversight is so undefined. Federal officials have routinely said that the stablecoin market – now at $173 billion, according to coinmarketcap.com – is still paltry compared with the others overseen by such agencies as the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission. And the industry’s regulatory oversight remains an open question, leaving federal officials uncertain about their reach.  Even if the agencies wanted to step in as UST users are losing billions, it’s uncertain which one would have authority to protect investors. And unlike regulated investments, which enjoy government backstops such as insurance from the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), there’s no such protection for those who put their dollars into UST, which topped at $18 billion.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | LUNA | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/05/11/ust-meltdown-hasnt-spurred-us-financial-stability-council-meeting-sources,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dfdca5a952e4f0ee61f207382f30d5dad70cb93b-3043x2369.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Nu Holdings, Nubank's parent company, also said it is allocating roughly 1% of the cash on its balance sheet to bitcoin to show its belief in the cryptocurrency.  The crypto trading and custody service will be provided by Paxos’ blockchain infrastructure, Paxos told CoinDesk.  The product will gradually be made available to Nubank users in Brazil on Thursday, Paxos said, adding that it will reach all of its customers by the end of July. Regarding the available cryptocurrencies in the future, the company added that it “will do frequent curation to add more.”  According to Paxos, users will be able to buy and sell crypto with Brazilian reals, but initially won't be able to withdraw or deposit crypto.  Brazil is experiencing major crypto adoption growth. According to Receita Federal, the Brazilian tax authority, between January and November of 2021, locals traded $11.4 billion in stablecoins, almost triple the amount traded the previous year.  Until now, Nubank allowed users to invest in crypto only through exchange-traded funds available through its investment unit, NuInvest, according to the company’s website.  “There is no doubt that crypto is a growing trend in Latin America, one that we have been following closely and believe will have a transformational impact on the region. Yet the trading experience is still very niche as customers either lack information to feel confident to enter this new market or just get frustrated by complex experiences,” Nubank CEO and co-founder David Vélez said in a statement.  Nubank has 53.9 million users in Brazil, Mexico and Colombia, according to its 2021 annual report. Last year, the bank reported revenues of $1.7 billion  In December, Nu Holdings went public at an initial valuation of $41.5 billion, making it one of Brazil's most valuable companies, though its market cap has since fallen to around $17.4 billion. As of February, Berkshire Hathaway owned about $1 billion worth of shares in the company, despite CEO Warren Buffett being famously critical of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general.  In December, Paxos partnered with Mercado Pago, the digital wallet of Mercado Libre, Latin America’s largest e-commerce company by market value, to allow its users in Brazil to buy and sell bitcoin, ether and the stablecoin Pax dollar (USDP).

This was nearly 20% less than it was two weeks before that day. The price of the most popular cryptocurrency began to fall on May 5, not long after the Federal Reserve stated that it would fight inflation without raising interest rates further. Several factors, including rising inflation, geopolitical crises, and shifting monetary policy in the United States, continue to make the crypto and stock markets more volatile in the short term. In recent months, the cryptocurrency market has resembled the stock market. This has increased its ties to the global economy. Bitcoin&apos;s price was below $40,000 on March 5. This was before President Joe Biden signed a broad executive order on cryptocurrencies, causing the price to rise by 10% to more than $42,000. Biden&apos;s executive order directed government agencies to develop a plan for regulating cryptocurrencies. He also directed them to consider issuing a central bank-issued digital currency. It was the White House&apos;s first significant step toward regulating cryptocurrencies. By the end of March, the price of Bitcoin had remained above $45,000 and had frequently surpassed $48,000.

42423373,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2Ytph,1652289867,Crisis in Terra's UST Stablecoin Spreads to Neutrino USD on Waves Protocol,"Neutrino USD (USDN), an algorithmic stablecoin within the Waves blockchain ecosystem, slipped below its U.S. dollar peg after the largest algorithmic stablecoin, TerraUSD (UST), tumbled early Wednesday to as low as 23 cents.  USDN, which is supposed to maintain its price at $1, dropped 12% to 88 cents on Wednesday, according to data provider Messari. The Waves platform's native token, WAVES, fell 26% in the last 24 hours to $9.  USDN is the stablecoin of the Waves protocol and is similar by design to the Terra blockchain's algorithmic stablecoin, UST. Users need to lock the WAVES token into Neutrino's smart contracts to mint USDN, while USDN redemptions destroy the stablecoin to unlock WAVES supply, thus balancing supply and demand and keeping the stablecoin at the peg.  After the implosion of UST – which had a market capitalization of $18 billion before losing its peg and which crumpled the Terra ecosystem causing turmoil in the broader cryptocurrency markets – smaller algorithmic stablecoins saw increased pressure and their prices started to wobble.  ""Clearly you are seeing the UST contagion spreading,"" Messari analyst Dustin Teander told CoinDesk. ""The Curve pool for USDN-3pool is now imbalanced with 92% being USDN. We saw the same sort of ratios play out on UST's Curve pools. This is usually a good sign the peg is under pressure and it requires new deposits to restore the balance.""  Crypto research firm Delphi Digital wrote in its daily report on Monday that while UST received most of the attention relating to de-pegging, smaller algorithmic stablecoins such as FRAX, FEI and USDN are facing the same danger. ""It remains to be seen whether each project will be robust enough to maintain its peg during these volatile times,"" the report said.  This is the second time in 40 days that USDN's price slipped significantly from the dollar peg. On April 4, USDN dropped by double-digit percentage points after users accused the platform of manipulating the price of the WAVES token through its decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform Vires.finance. Waves CEO Sasha Ivanov dismissed the accusations and blamed short sellers – traders who bet on profiting on asset's price going down – for USDN's woes.

42423380,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2Ytzh,1652286656,5 US States Issue Emergency Orders to Shut Down Metaverse Casino With Alleged Russian Ties,"Regulators in five U.S. states issued emergency orders on Wednesday requiring a metaverse casino with alleged Russian ties to immediately halt the sale of its non-fungible tokens (NFT), citing fraud, deceit and registration violations.  The five states are Alabama, New Jersey, Texas, Kentucky and Wisconsin.  The Flamingo Casino Club began operating in Russia in March, regulators say, and has been soliciting investors through the sale of securitized NFTs.  Regulators say the Flamingo Casino Club operators took steps to conceal its connection to Russia, “using a phony office address, providing a telephone number that is not in service, [and] concealing its actual physical location and hiding material about its principals.”  According to an order filed by the Texas State Securities Board, the securitized NFTs give would-be investors partial ownership of the casino, a portion of the profits generated by the casino and the ability to enter into lotteries offering Teslas, iPhones and million-dollar cash prizes.  Potential investors were further enticed by what regulators say were fraudulent claims of association with the Flamingo Las Vegas Hotel and Casino, a legitimate casino, which regulators say has “no affiliation” or partnership with the Flamingo Casino Club.  Operators of the alleged scam promised investors their funds would be used to build a functioning casino and entertainment facility in the Sandbox metaverse. The plans included “a virtual stadium for virtual games and concerts, a virtual hotel, a virtual movie theater, a virtual bowling alley … [and] a virtual hockey team named ‘Flamingos,’” according to the orders.  Funds would supposedly be generated via gambling in the metaverse casino, where avatars would be able to play “craps, baccarat, minibaccarat, blackjack and roulette.”  Flamingo Casino Club’s operators told investors in April they were negotiating with rapper Snoop Dogg to purchase a plot of land in the Sandbox metaverse – but regulators say there is no evidence of this negotiation ever occurring.  Regulators say the Flamingo Casino Club operators never registered the sale of their securitized NFTs with the securities boards, and failed to respond to numerous inquiries.

But it failed: The token of this long-abandoned project never achieved its target of dollar parity, sank below $1 in early 2021 and was trading well below 1 cent on Wednesday. Now history appears to be repeating: Over the last three days, UST sank precipitously below its peg, going as low as 27 cents in early morning U.S. hours Wednesday.  UST’s depegging has shocked crypto markets and regulators alike as the once-$15 billion stablecoin has continued its downward spiral. While BAC’s $54.5 million footprint was far smaller in impact, it offers a historical data point for observers grappling with the feasibility of algorithmic stablecoins.  Hyungsuk Kang, a former engineer at Terraform Labs (TFL), said Basis Cash was, in fact, a side project from some of Terra’s early creators, including himself and Kwon. Kang ultimately left TFL to build a Terra competitor called Standard Protocol.  “Basis Cash wasn’t tested at the moment, and we weren’t even sure” it would work, Kang said. Kwon “wanted to just test it out. He said that this was a pilot project for doing that.”  Another Basis Cash builder who spoke to CoinDesk on condition of anonymity confirmed that Do Kwon and TFL employees were behind the project.  Both Kang and the anonymous employee tell CoinDesk Kwon was “Rick Sanchez,” the pseudonymous co-founder. CoinDesk also reviewed internal “Basis Cash Korea (BCK)” chat logs in which Kwon alludes to himself as “Rick.”  (Kwon and his Basis Cash co-founder “Morty” borrowed their pseudonyms from the popular animated TV show “Rick and Morty.”)  Kwon did not respond to CoinDesk’s requests for comment.  Basis Cash never reached the heights of other Kwon-linked crypto projects. Its total value locked (TVL) briefly peaked at $174 million in February 2021, two orders of magnitude below Terra’s $30 billion TVL before this week’s historic sell-off.  Revealing the real name behind an online pseudonym (even a long-discarded one) is not a decision CoinDesk takes lightly. Our default position is to respect the privacy of pseudonymous actors with established reputations under their well-known handles unless there is an overwhelming public interest in revealing their real-world identities.  In this case, there is such public interest as Kwon’s UST stablecoin death spirals, wreaking havoc across the broader cryptocurrency market. Amid this precarious situation, investors deserve to know that UST was not Kwon’s sole attempt at making an algorithmic stablecoin work.  What was Basis Cash?  Basis Cash and its promise of an algorithmic stablecoin predated crypto Rick and Morty.  An anonymous team of builders – mostly employees of Terraform Labs, according to chat logs reviewed by CoinDesk – modeled Basis Cash after an earlier project called Basis (formerly known as Basecoin).  Basis, an erstwhile venture capital darling, raised $133 million before shutting its doors in 2018 over regulatory concerns. Founder Nader Al-Naji then said that “there would be no way” for Basis’s peg maintenance tokens to avoid securities designations; he shuttered the project rather than fight it out in court.  (Al-Naji would later launch a controversial crypto startup under a pseudonym before ultimately doxxing himself under pressure.)  Read more: 'Basis Cash' Launch Brings Defunct Stablecoin Into the DeFi Era  But Basis’s algorithmic ideals continued to float around stablecoin circles right on through to the heat of DeFi summer 2020, when Rick and Morty stepped in. Kwon and other algorithmic stablecoin adherents have long argued that the decentralized finance space needs a decentralized stable currency without censorship risk or central points of failure. Such an approach contrasts with that of market-leading stablecoins like Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC, which maintain their $1 peg by (in theory) backing every digital dollar with their centralized treasuries.  “Yo degens, anyone remember what Basis was? It was one of the early ‘DeFi’ algorithmic stablecoins with high ambitions, but it was shut down due to SEC-related risks,” said Rick’s since-deleted Telegram account in the Basis Cash Telegram channel on Aug. 20, 2020. “Today we’re bringing Basis back from the grave.”  Apparently intrigued by the early ideas behind Basis, Do Kwon directed a select group of TFL employees to resurrect what eventually became Basis Cash, Kang and another early TFL engineer say. The Korea-based project was envisioned as a way to test out the core concepts of the original Basis without falling prey to U.S. regulatory pitfalls.  CoinDesk’s sources say Kwon deliberately distanced himself from the day-to-day operations of the project, though he proposed most of the core ideas behind Basis Cash and its underlying token model. Analogous to UST, which relies on a token-burn mechanic involving its sister coin LUNA, BAC relies on a bonding mechanism to maintain its $1 peg.  Kwon also appeared to serve as a spokesperson for the project on Twitter and other forums under his “Rick” pseudonym (CoinDesk cannot confirm whether others ever filled in as “Rick,” but Kang, the other Basis Cash builder, and chat logs suggest the moniker primarily belonged to Kwon).  On its website, Basis Cash describes itself as a “Decentralized Stablecoin with an Algorithmic Central Bank,” and in a November 2020 interview with CoinDesk, “Rick” shared a vision for Basis Cash similar to that for UST.  “In the long term, we look forward to seeing Basis Cash be used widely as a base layer primitive such that there is organic demand for the asset in many DeFi and commercial settings,” he said over Telegram at the time.  Lessons for UST?  One of the first examples of an algorithmic stablecoin to be tested in the wild, Basis Cash never found its footing. Game theory and smart contracts were supposed to regulate BAC’s supply to keep it trading at the price of $1, but the token never managed to hold on to its dollar peg.  By all outward appearances, Kwon had nothing to do the Basis Cash project. He has even made statements suggesting he was a critic:  But even amid Basis Cash’s struggles, Kwon’s main account could be spotted from time to time in the project’s Telegram, sans pseudonym.  A user surprised to find Terra’s founder in the Basis Cash Telegram group once asked Kwon what he was doing there.  “I like studying new things. Especially old things that are new again,” he responded.  Zack Seward contributed reporting.

Participants in the round include Mechanism Play, TCG Crypto, Dragonfly Capital, Polychain, Coinbase Ventures, Three Arrows Capital and Polygon Studios CEO Ryan Wyatt, among others.  Branch co-founder Dayton Mills calls the game “Animal Crossing meets Minecraft with a bit of Runescape,” taking popular mechanics from various titles in the nascent non-fungible token (NFT) gaming sector and combining them into one browser-based, free-to-play experience.  “I can’t think of anything similar in the play-to-earn space because most play-to-earn games require you to buy an NFT upfront to play them,” Mills told CoinDesk in an interview. “But in our world, it's very much designed so that you may not ever even know what an NFT is.”  The gameplay itself will be based around islands that users can own as NFTs, each with a different composite of virtual resources. The resources can be crafted into usable items or structures within the world of the game, with the “earn” component of its play-to-earn label coming from users paying each other to harvest the materials for them, or reselling said items as NFTs on secondary marketplaces.  Mills believes the game will attract multiple demographics from the global play-to-earn player base, ranging from U.S.-based users looking to invest in virtual real estate to Axie Infinity-type players looking to grind an income, as well as the casual gamers just playing for fun.  The Seattle-based startup’s approach of keeping the crypto out of sight could also be a strategic one, possibly avoiding the backlash that has become inseparable from NFT-based games and their accompanying narratives.  Branch says the full release of its game is slated for some time in the summer, with the final product ideally being built out week-by-week with close participation from its community.",POSITIVE,없음,AXS | EXCHANGE | MATIC,Eli Tan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/05/11/animal-crossing-meets-minecraft-branch-raises-125m-for-play-to-earn-project,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3229b7faed8da80e0952d43b2359eeac264a115d-2324x1286.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It became a foundation project upon which other projects could build on. However, scalability issues and high gas prices made it difficult for the network to expand. After receiving a lot of negative feedback about the issues above, the developers decided to create a Layer-2 solution for them. Even though Layer-2 transactions are much easier and less expensive, the network&apos;s co-founder intends to reduce the transaction fee further. What Are Layer-2 Solutions? The Layer-2 solution&apos;s design aims to aid application growth by taking some of the transaction processing work off of the Ethereum Mainnet (layer 1) while keeping the same level of security and decentralization as the mainnet. As a result, Layer 2 solutions improve transaction speed while lowering gas costs. Immutable X, Polygon, and Polkadot are common Ethereum Layer-2 solutions. Why Are Layer-2 Solutions Important? Layer-2 solutions are important because they enable scalability without jeopardizing the integrity of the Ethereum blockchain.

A trust charter from the New York State Department of Financial Services enables digital asset companies to offer crypto trading and custody services in the Empire State. BitGo and Coinbase are among the firms to have been granted such a charter in the past.  Trust charters grant fiduciary powers to recipients enabling them to manage their clients' assets and offer crypto-as-a-service products to other regulated financial institutions.  The other route to regulatory approval in New York is to apply for a BitLicense. The BitLicense framework has drawn criticism for being stifling to innovation for its time and capital-intensive application and compliance measures.  FTX revealed its application by appointing Marissa MacDonald as chief compliance officer for the FTX Trust Company. MacDonald previously held the equivalent position at Fidelity Digital Assets.  FTX US, the stateside wing of Sam Bankman-Fried's crypto exchange, raised $400 million in funding at an $8 billion valuation earlier this year.

The stock has lost more than 70% this year.  While several Wall Street analysts see Coinbase as a leader across the broader crypto industry, they say headwinds remain in place, and many lowered their price targets early Wednesday. And Goldman Sachs downgraded Coinbase to neutral from buy, reducing its price target from $240 to $80. Goldman analyst Will Nance said Coinbase is still the “blue chip way” to gain crypto exposure for investors, but doesn’t expect the company to return to recent levels of profitability in the near term without a spike in crypto prices or more volatility.  Meanwhile, JPMorgan told clients ""we continue to recommend Coinbase as we see it as a leader in the crypto-ecosystem, but we acknowledge that crypto is in need of a catalyst and the risk in owning Coinbase stock continues to rise with positive earnings getting pushed further to the future."" JPMorgan analyst Kenneth Worthington cut the bank's price target on Coinbase to $171 from $258, maintaining an overweight recommendation on shares.  Read more: Coinbase Has No Risk of Bankruptcy, New 10-Q Disclosure Language Is SEC Requirement, CEO Armstrong Says  Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong nevertheless suggested in a tweet on Wednesday that his company's shares may now be undervalued.     Coinbase said in an earnings release after the market closed on Tuesday that it expects the second quarter to be weaker than the first with respect to monthly transacting users and overall trading volumes.  Some analysts see an opportunity in the battered shares of the crypto exchange, indicating potential for long-term growth.  Coinbase is trading as though it will “burn through all of its cash and then become insolvent,” Mark Palmer, BTIG’s equity research analyst said in a note. Eventually, investors will recognize an opportunity in the shares, he said, calling the stock drop “greatly overblown.” BTIG maintained a buy recommendation and lowered the price target to $380 from $500.  The company said it remains focused on investments, while acknowledging the choppy market conditions.  “We believe these market conditions are not permanent and we remain focused on the long-term,” the company said in the earnings release. “In fact, our investment in our business now is especially critical – these periods of low volatility can provide the opportunity to focus more intently on product development (as opposed to peak periods, when we are more focused on meeting high demand). We approach the opportunities ahead with confidence and steady hands.”  UPDATE (May 11, 13:35 UTC): Updates stock price movement.

The move will lower the number of its shares outstanding to about 82 million from about 411 million and will be effective on May 20, according to a statement.  “In speaking to shareholders at the numerous conferences I have attended in the past 60 days, it is apparent that some shareholders are finding it challenging to compare HIVE to its industry peers as we have many more shares outstanding,” Executive Chairman Frank Holmes said in the statement.  Consolidation of shares, which is commonly known as a reverse stock split, is a process by which a publicly traded company reduces its share count and increases the price of each share outstanding.  After the consolidation, price of each share will be higher and will create more visibility among large investors as many institutional investors, mutual funds in particular, have policies against taking positions in a stock priced under a minimum share price, regardless of the market capitalization, Holmes noted.  “We believe that an increased share price arising from the share consolidation, on the TSX-V and especially the Nasdaq, will enable us to attract a broader range of shareholders, gain increased liquidity and deliver long-term value to investors,” Chief Financial Officer Darcy Daubaras said in the release.  The miner's shares have plunged about 55% so this year.

Individuals can sell bitcoin (BTC) or ether (ETH) tax free after one year, Parliamentary State Secretary Katja Hessel said in a statement.  The guidance deals with issues like mining, staking, lending, hard forks and airdrops, as well as the tax treatment of buying and selling bitcoin and ether, the finance ministry said.  The guide confirms that the one-year period applies even to cryptocurrency that has been lent out or used by someone else as a stake to create new ethereum blocks. Hessel also ruled out applying to crypto the alternative 10-year holding period to be exempt from taxes that applies to non-mobile assets such as land.  In addition, according to the guide, income tax doesn’t apply when redeeming utility tokens, the crypto assets that give a particular right, such as access to a network or to receive a certain product. The finance ministry cited a 2018 court judgment concerning bearer bonds to say redeeming the tokens doesn’t count as a sale under income tax law.

The funding round was led by Coinbase Ventures, Alameda Research, Distributed Global, Day One Ventures, TQ Ventures and more, according to a press release.  Mara plans to invest in a suite of products targeting Nigeria and Kenya, Africa’s two largest countries, before expanding to East Africa and Francophone countries, said CEO Chi Nnandi.  Mara is trying to crack a burgeoning crypto scene: According to the World Economic Forum, estimates show crypto adoption had grown by $106 billion in Africa in the year ending June 2021; Mara wants to grow it more.  Crypto in Africa  In an interview, Nnandi said he’s trying to change the narrative expressed by Yuval Noah Harari in ""Homo Deus"": that poor countries get left behind when new technologies arrive. That notion “lit a fire underneath him,” he said.  He’s trying to do it by creating products that will allow users to not only trade crypto (such as Mara’s upcoming Android app and an advanced trading platform) but develop Web 3 products of their own.  Nnandi said Mara plans to host hackathons after its launch to inspire developers to “build Web 3 engineering communities.”  Read more: Central African Republic Adopts Bitcoin as Legal Tender  Mara is also launching a layer 1 chain fueled by its native MARA token and will launch its testnet in the fourth quarter.  Expanding cryptocurrency products into new regions comes with new regulatory challenges.

Bancor 3 launched out of beta with an improved version aimed at creating more sustainable liquidity by giving participants access to ""Single-Sided Staking"" with no risk of impermanent loss, and providing them with ""Auto-Compounding"" and ""Dual Rewards.""  Single-sided staking consists of earning yields on just one token provided by a user to a Bancor pool to maintain 100% exposure to that token. A single-sided ""pool token"" will be issued to users in return, with these tokens rising or falling relative to the prices of the underlying tokens.  This is in contrast to other decentralized finance (DeFi) pools that require users to deposit multiple tokens in a pool, which increases risk and exposure.  The auto-compounding features reinvest earnings back into the pools to generate higher returns. Meanwhile, dual rewards refer to third-party token projects and partners that can incentivize user liquidity and activity on Bancor.  Bancor generates millions in fees per month for depositors and offers up to 30% annualized returns on tokens such as ether (ETH), weighted bitcoin (WBTC), chainlink (LINK), and others.  Over 30 decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) use Bancor as a treasury management solution, including Polygon, UMA, Nexus Mutual and KeeperDAO.  The launch has attracted token projects and DAOs, including Polygon (MATIC), Synthetix (SNX), Yearn (YFI), and WOO Network (WOO), among others, to partner with Bancor and offers dual rewards to users.",POSITIVE,LINK | MATIC | WOO,LINK | MARKET | MATIC | MINING | WOO,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/05/11/bancor-3-goes-live-with-polygon-yearn-others-as-partners,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png
42423389,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2YuDh,1652272679,"Inflation Rose to 8.3% in April, With Monthly Core CPI Doubling From March","U.S. inflation slowed last month for the first time since November 2020, a Labor Department report Wednesday showed.  The consumer price index (CPI), the most widely used gauge to track inflation, dropped to 8.3% in April from a year earlier, down from 8.5% in March, a four-decade high, according to the report published Wednesday. Economists had estimated an 8.1% rate for April.  But core inflation, which excludes seasonally volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.6% from March, double the rate from the prior month and higher than the 0.4% clip that economists had forecast.  Bitcoin (BTC) was down 4.8% within minutes after the report was released, changing hands at $30,145.  Crypto analysts and traditional economists alike are watching core inflation particularly closely this month, as headline inflation figures could be misleading because of a big jump in the CPI this time last year.  “The year-on year-numbers are going to come down, almost no matter what,” said Eric Winograd, director of developed market economic research at AllianceBernstein. ”That isn't particularly meaningful, because it doesn't tell us what's really going on with prices right now. It tells us what went on with prices a year ago.”  The CPI saw a big jump during the spring last year, from 2.6% in March to 4.7% in April, making it difficult to draw comparisons between this year’s numbers.  Core inflation, however, is the percentage change month-over-month, which is why analysts prefer looking at that data point to evaluate current inflationary pressure.  Compared with inflation reports earlier this year, April’s report could be less significant for traders in general, as they track inflation to make assumptions about what the Federal Reserve might do to keep inflation in check.  “They've already told us their next step,” Winograd said. “So it takes something very dramatically different for them to change that path.”  Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has already said that it is very likely that the central bank will increase the interest rate by half a percentage point at each of the next couple meetings.  President Biden weighs in  Many critics blame President Joe Biden for the highest inflation in 40 years and for deflecting the blame for the current state of the economy.  With midterm elections coming up in November, the president spoke about inflation on Tuesday, assuring Americans that he is “taking inflation very seriously"" and saying ""it’s my top domestic priority.”  “President Biden and the Democrats are likely to be hard put to maintain their majority in Congress,” said Scott MacDonald, chief economist at Smith's Research & Gradings. “An economy in trouble, with a recession of near recession, tight money policy and inflation does not make a good tailwind.”",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/05/11/headline-inflation-slowed-to-83-in-april-but-core-inflation-keeps-rising,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/116ccab3422998cdbfd790bca8d7b692067ee275-5616x3744.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The board of directors of the crypto-focused financial services firm approved a plan to bid on up to 10.6 million ordinary shares throughout the next 12 months, according to a press release. The firm will file a notice to the Toronto Stock Exchange, where its shares are listed.  Galaxy Digital may use the stock buyback program when it ""believes that the current market price of its shares does not reflect their intrinsic value,"" it said.  The company stressed that Galaxy Digital Trading has experienced ""no operational or execution-related disruptions,"" and its counterparty loan and yield portfolio has seen no credit defaults, degradations or liquidations.

42420812,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWYcKz,1652268600,Merge Testing on Ethereum: What Is It and Why Does It Matter?,"Welcome to this week’s guest writer, CoinDesk reporter Eli Tan, who is filling in for Sam Kessler. Follow him @elitanjourno.  As the Ethereum network inches toward “the Merge” and transitions from a proof-of-work (PoW) system to proof-of-stake (PoS), developers are using new testing infrastructure to assess network mechanics and client readiness.  The first major test, known as a “shadow fork,” came in April – we covered the event in depth in a previous edition of the newsletter, but the gist is that the test went well and has been repeated two times since.  This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum’s evolution and its impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  These types of tests are crucial to the advancement of the network because they allow developers to find bugs in the code that could be otherwise missed using the devnets.  In the April 11 shadow fork, for example, developers uncovered a bug having to do with gas limits being artificially raised by miners.  The second shadow fork on April 23 was even more promising, with every one of the network’s client combinations surviving the transition and staying in sync for the first time.  The most recent shadow fork took place on May 5 and included new tests on syncing through the Merge, which revealed a few small but fixable points of improvement.  Like many aspects of the Ethereum network, merge testing is a collaborative effort, and a crucially important one at that. Developers are encouraged to log their testing results on a shared leaderboard.  Staging the Merge  Hive tests  Another form of merge testing is using Hive tests. Hive is the integration testing platform for the current Ethereum network’s Execution Layer (EL), and is used to test the new engine APIs.  Like the network itself, Hive tests are constantly evolving. Most recently, testing teams have added the ability for Hive tests to mock the new proof-of-stake Ethereum Consensus Layer (CL) behavior. This new integration will allow it to run a simulator for the transition from PoW to PoS and see how both the CL and EL will behave.  Read more: ‘Ethereum’ vs ‘Eth 2’: What’s in a Name?  In a May 4 merge testing update, it was announced that Kurtosis had been added to Ethereum’s testing infrastructure.  Kurtosis  The main function of Kurtosis is that it helps spin up staging networks, which are testing environments to isolate specific aspects of the Merge.  According to developers, these staging environments will allow them to monitor various network health metrics during stress testing under simulated harsher network conditions.  Pulse check  The following is an overview of network activity on the Ethereum Beacon Chain over the past week. For more information about the metrics featured in this section, check out our 101 explainer on Eth 2.0 metrics.

Validated takes  Algorithmic stablecoin UST lost its $1 peg for the second time in three days.  WHY IT MATTERS: Since May 9, UST fell as low as $0.65 while its sister token LUNA dropped as low as $24.85, according to data from CoinGecko. The Luna Foundation Guard drained its $1.5 billion bitcoin (BTC) reserve and bought $850 million more in BTC in a bid to defend UST’s peg. UST has since returned to $0.90 following LFG’s deployment of additional bitcoin. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen focused on the ongoing distress of the stablecoin during testimony before a U.S. Senate panel on May 10.  Total value locked (TVL) on decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols set 2022 lows at $160.74 billion as of May 10.  WHY IT MATTERS: $44.43 billion in locked value was lost since May 5, according to data from DeFiLlama. Stablecoin swap platform Curve, the largest DeFi protocol by TVL, saw a 16% drop in the past week. Lido, the leading liquid staking solution, saw a decrease of roughly 29%. TVL for Terra’s Anchor slid 57%. Tokens of the broader DeFi sector lost 34% on average; by comparison, the meme coin sector lost just 16%.  Compound Treasury received a B- credit rating from S&P Global Ratings, making it the first institutional DeFi offering to be rated by a credit rating agency.  WHY IT MATTERS: S&P indicated that uncertain regulations for stablecoins, risks in converting stablecoins to fiat currency and Compound Treasury’s limited capital base were some factors contributing to its assigned rating. With a B- grade, the USDC-powered yield platform is judged to be “speculative” but “currently has the capacity to meet financial commitments.”  Instagram is testing non-fungible token (NFT) integrations.  WHY IT MATTERS: With over one billion monthly active users, Instagram will initially support Ethereum-based NFTs, with integrations on Polygon, Solana and Flow to be added at a later date. Instagram parent Meta (FB) is working on three-dimensional, augmented-reality NFTs with its Spark AR software, which will first be compatible with Instagram stories. While Instagram will not charge users for posting and sharing NFTs, it hopes to turn NFTs into a revenue stream for creators.  The U.K. will introduce legislation to regulate the crypto industry.  WHY IT MATTERS: The Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Bill will create “powers to more quickly and easily seize and recover crypto assets, which are the principal medium used for ransomware.” The aim is to “mitigate the risk posed by those who cannot be criminally prosecuted but use their funds to further criminality.”  Factoid of the week",POSITIVE,BTC | LUNA,BTC | ETH | FIAT | LUNA | REGULATION,"Eli Tan, Sage D.

Algorithmic stablecoins like UST are supposed to be automatically pegged to the price of another currency. By design, 1 UST can be redeemed or minted for exactly $1 worth of LUNA at any time, which in theory helps retain its value. The project, however, later added a bitcoin reserve as additional backing  UST, however, lost its peg and fell to as low as 66 cents on Monday. It regained 90 cents on Tuesday before slumping to lows of less than 35 cents during Asian trading hours on Wednesday. That was accompanied by a steep drop in the price of LUNA.  Kwon, who has been uncharacteristically silent on Twitter over the past few days, says there’s a plan to bring UST back to its peg.  “The price stabilization mechanism is absorbing UST supply (over 10% of total supply),” Kwon wrote in a tweet during European trading hours, explaining how UST works. “But the cost of absorbing so many stablecoins at the same time has stretched out the on-chain swap spread to 40%, and LUNA price has diminished dramatically absorbing the arbs.”  Arbs refers to arbitrage, or a trading strategy used by traders who buy and sell LUNA and UST to maintain the peg and make a profit by doing so.  “The only path forward will be to absorb the stablecoin supply that wants to exit before $UST can start to repeg. There is no way around it,” Kwon said, adding that Terra endorsed the community proposal “1164,” which proposes increasing the minting capacity of Terra’s LUNA from $293 million to over $1.2 billion.  That means additional LUNA would be minted and sold in the market to try to bring UST’s peg back to $1. That is in addition to a separate proposal that aims to offer lower yield to users of Anchor, a Terra product.  The proposal explains: “[By allowing] more efficient UST burning and LUNA minting, [which] will in the short term put pressure to LUNA price, but will be an effective way to bring UST back to peg, which will eventually stabilize LUNA price.”  Meanwhile, LUNA fell to $2.2 in the past hour as traders anticipated further supply increases to add to selling pressure on the token, CoinDesk data shows.

Dubbed ""Emergency measures for restoring Terra peg,"" the proposal aims to lower minimum interest rates to 3.5% and maximum deposit rates to 5.5%.  Anchor is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform where the majority of UST staking/borrowing takes place. It has seen its total volume locked (TVL) slump to about $3 billion from almost $18 billion.  The current yield of 18% would be temporarily reduced with a ""targeted interest rate of 4%,"" according to the proposal. ""A depegged UST cannot sustain 18% APY any longer,"" according to the post, referring to an annual percentage yield.  Reducing the interest rate would prevent the Anchor reserve from depleting and contribute to ""stopping the depeg death spiral.""  Another proposed emergency measure is to increase virtual liquidity for Terra to Luna swaps by a factor of 1,000 to avoid a prolonged UST depeg.  TVL for Anchor Protocol has dropped to $2.61 billion from last week's high of $17.15 billion, according to DeFiLlama.

The lack of price action history brings the lack of the 200-day EMA, but the market value trades under the 50 and 100-day EMA reflecting a bearish trend. Moreover, the EMAs maintain a bearish trend in motion, projecting a relatively firmer seller grip over the trend. The RSI slope shows an abrupt drop from the overbought zone under pressure from the 14-day SMA and is moving towards the undersold territory.

42423409,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2Yynh,1652261400,Stepn’s ‘Move-to-Earn’ Model Has Crypto Analysts Seeing Value in the Long Run,"Stepn, a ""move-to-earn"" application on the Solana blockchain that allows users to get cryptocurrency rewards from walking or jogging, is getting traction in digital-asset markets.  The fitness app has grown to more than 300,000 daily active users in a few months.  And Stepn's native token, green metaverse token (GMT), is changing hands at around $2.20, roughly 17 times where it started trading at in March, although it has retreated from its all-time high of about $4.11 last month.  “This actually has value in the long run,” said Will McEvoy, senior associate at the independent investment research firm Fundstrat. “Price stability is important because if the price were to fluctuate 50% a week, it would incentivize users to pull out.”  The project is burning up the track so much in real life that there’s a waiting list to join its Telegram group, which has more than 200,000 members already. Users have to be sent an invite to join the app, and the STEPN team has limited the number of activation codes available. Users can get the codes from Telegram groups, Discord chats and other STEPN online communities. Each day the company issues 3,000 joining codes.  An NFT (non-fungible token) sneaker is a virtual sneaker that users purchase on the STEPN marketplace in order to start earning crypto by either walking, jogging or running. The app tracks users' movements similar to how a Fitbit does. The current starting price of a sneaker, which is denominated in SOL, the native token of Solana, is around 12 SOL ($803). The price of the virtual sneakers varies depending on earning levels, the better the quality, the more benefits offered.  Sales volumes for the NFT sneakers have also been growing significantly. According to data from Delphi Digital, sales reached a high of $57 million daily and have dominated most of Solana’s NFT trading volume.  Delphi Digital notes in its report on Stepn that this volume drives significant fees to the app, because it charges a 6% fee (2% trading fee, 4% royalty fee) for every sale on its marketplace.  “The high fees have been earning the team around $2 to $3 million daily at current volumes, with their cumulative fees earned from Feb. 1-April 30 estimated to be $68.2 million,” the report said.  Stepn Earnings  Mohammad Noor, a freelance virtual assistant based in Bangladesh, India, said he heard about Stepn on YouTube and was attracted to the app because he saw it as a good side hustle that could also improve his health.  “Jogging is essential to me and now I earn money to do it,” Noor, 35, said in an interview with CoinDesk. He said he earns around $75 a day from jogging twice a day for 30 minutes each time.  According to the company’s white paper, players can choose to lease or sell their NFT sneakers on the in-app marketplace; users’ earnings are stored in the in-app wallet, which has a built-in swap function.  Noor bought his first pair of sneakers for 10.8 SOL ($70) and said that they are now worth 20 SOL. He thinks Stepn has a bright future because the app is earning money from users in more than just one way – minting shoes, selling shoes and from refilling users' energy.  “It seems that the developers learnt lessons from other play-to-earn projects that failed,” Noor said.  Stepn is similar to so-called play-to-earn (p2e) games where players can earn cryptocurrency rewards from playing video games in the sense that users partake in an activity and earn a passive income from it. According to McEvoy, however, Stepn has a much longer trajectory than p2e games like Axie Infinity.  The app has repurposed the p2e model with a lifestyle and fitness peg that encourages users to exercise. Get off the couch, in other words.  “The runway for Stepn is much longer than the runway of Axie,” McEvoy said. “This is because the total addressable market of people who would use Stepn is bigger than those who would use Axie.  “Over a billion people walk, and half a billion use fitness tracking apps on their smartphones. There you have 500 million people that this makes sense for,” McEvoy said.  Tokenomics  The green metaverse token can be used to repair, unlock and level up your sneakers. It can also be minted.  One issue with betting on the GMT tokens, according to Fundstrat’s analysts, is that they can be difficult to value.  Although they have a limited supply of 6 billion tokens, the Stepn developers can change the rules of the game.  “In a sense the Stepn developers play the role of a central bank, pulling demand-side levers that either support asset prices or cool them off, much like the Fed,” McEvoy said. “This makes it difficult to predict how the token will play out.”  Already, the developers have changed the amount of GMT required for in-game upgrades. Increasing the amount of GMT needed to level up users' sneakers boosts demand for the tokens.  GMT gets burnt when spent on level ups within the game, which decreases the overall supply of the token.  “This type of change should have a positive impact on price and needs to be considered when valuing GMT,” McEvoy said.  On April 28, the price of GMT reached its all-time high of $9.08, according to data from CoinMarketCap, and is down 58% since then.  STEPN developers soon pushed an update to the game that substituted green satoshi tokens (GST) for GMT as the token required for minting new NFTs, temporarily.  GST is a utility token that can be used to purchase goods in the app. It has an unlimited supply and can be minted in the game through basic movements.  This decreased demand for GST as a result of the developers' change cooled off the price and increased demand for GMT.  According to McEvoy, these kinds of updates from the development team provide a level of price stability that should contribute to the overall sustainability and longevity of the app.  The downside is that increasing NFT prices means fewer potential users can afford the app. Striking a balance between the price of GST, GMT and the NFTs will be crucial, he said.",POSITIVE,SOL,AXS | BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/05/11/stepns-move-to-earn-model-has-crypto-analysts-seeing-value-in-long-run,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c469d6bce81787675fa5cd95765eb1286a609090-448x290.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

""The FSB is well placed to take a leading role in the design of a coherent global regulatory framework for crypto assets,"" Knot said at the annual meeting of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association in Madrid.  The Basel, Switzerland-based FSB reports to the Group of 20 of the world's largest economies, and develops rules intended to stop 2008-style crises such as those applying to major international banks deemed too big to fail.  The Dutch central banker appeared to respond to a call from jurisdictions such as the European Union for an international framework for the sector, mirroring the kind of global rules brought in for banks and the financial system after 2008.  The FSB, which in February warned about the risk a growing and largely unregulated sector could pose for investor confidence and financial crime, is due to produce a report on stablecoins in October. It would join international standard-setters such as the Financial Action Task Force and OECD, which are respectively responsible for developing anti-money laundering and tax rules for the sector.  It wouldn't have to start from scratch, Knot said, and would first consider the existing laws that already apply to crypto.  ""This will provide a basis for additional work to address risks not covered by these pre-existing standards,"" he said. ""Crypto asset markets of today are not operating in a lawless environment, or a barren regulatory landscape.""

Data shows some 58% of traders were placing futures bets on higher LUNA prices despite Tuesday’s drop. That move accounted for over $63 million in liquidations, a higher-than-usual figure and one of the largest in the history of LUNA futures.  However, $387 million in open interest – or the amount of unsettled futures contracts – continues to exist at writing time, suggesting there could be more liquidations or volatile price action ahead as traders take profits or get liquidation.  Algorithmic stablecoins like UST are backed by a basket of assets, such as LUNA and bitcoin (BTC), without depending on any centralized third party to hold those assets. This week, however, UST lost its peg and fell to as low as 66 cents on Monday night before recovering to the 90-cent level on Tuesday.  Wednesday was not as kind in terms of recovery. UST fell to under 35 cents Wednesday morning as trader sentiment around the stablecoin dropped. This was despite the Luna Foundation Guard (LFG), a non-profit formed earlier this year to maintain a reserve backing for LUNA, liquidating its bitcoin holdings in an effort to try and save UST’s peg.  LUNA’s drop was among the steepest for a major cryptocurrency in recent times. Prices fell 85% in the past 24 hours, and 32% in the past hour alone as traders priced in contagion risks to the LUNA tokens after UST lost its peg earlier this week.  Part of LUNA’s decline came as parent firm Terra apparently issued more tokens to sell to the open market and raise money to back UST. As per its design, $1 worth of LUNA can be exchanged for exactly 1 UST, or vice versa.

The amount of bitcoin on exchanges is at a high not seen since November 2017, but Check said market conditions are very different and it's tough to make a comparison.  “It is not the same as 2017 in any way really, a completely different mechanism and set of entities at play. What we are observing is closer to a miniature version of George Soros attacking the peg of the British Pound, where the LFG is playing the role of the Bank of England (with a similar result it seems),” he said in an email to CoinDesk.

In recent years, cryptocurrency and insurance have been uneasy bedfellows, with a shortage of capacity in the market and many large crypto exchanges simply opting to self-insure, holding reserves of bitcoin (BTC) to cover their losses, typically in case of a hack of “hot” wallets, or those connected to the internet.  Superscript, which was part of last year’s Lloyd’s Lab accelerator, said the first crypto businesses in line to buy tech and cyber cover are Argent, Chiliz and CEX.  “As well as protecting the actual physical digital assets, there’s a whole other world of risk that also needs to be covered,” said Superscript digital assets lead Ben Davis in an interview. “So, if a platform goes down ... there are privacy breaches, ransomware attacks, breaches of contract, copyright and IP infringement. All that needs to be covered for crypto companies to move into the mainstream.”  As of 2021, there were just 350 brokers licensed to deal with Lloyd’s. Superscript says it’s the first Lloyd’s broker to provide a digital assets dedicated product; Lloyd’s-approved coverholder status was granted to Evertas earlier this year. (Lloyd’s policy is not to promote individual products and therefore it did not provide a quote for Daylight, a Superscript representative said via email.)  That said, Lloyd’s is slowly but surely coming round to crypto, according to Davis. “I would say the winds are changing a little bit for Lloyd’s in terms of digital asset risk,” he said.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/05/11/lloyds-licensed-broker-launches-crypto-insurance-product,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/407e4621521cd6234cee8a4a398826cfe687ae9c-4096x2732.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Armstrong said the exchange had ""included a new risk factor based on an SEC requirement called SAB 121, which is a newly required disclosure for public companies that hold crypto assets for third parties.""  The 10-Q, filed with the SEC Tuesday, says: ""Because custodially [sic] held crypto assets may be considered to be the property of a bankruptcy estate, in the event of a bankruptcy, the crypto assets we hold in custody on behalf of our customers could be subject to bankruptcy proceedings and such customers could be treated as our general unsecured creditors,"" Coinbase wrote in its recent filing.  Coinbase also disclosed the new language means customers may believe keeping their coins on the platform would be considered ""more risky,"" which would in turn materially impact its financial position.  In the event of bankruptcy, general unsecured creditors would be considered having the most to lose because they are last in line for claims.  ""We believe our Prime and Custody customers have strong legal protections in their terms of service that protects their assets, even in a black swan event like this,"" Armstrong wrote in the tweet. ""This disclosure makes sense in that these legal protections have not been tested in court for crypto assets specifically.""  Caitlin Long, founder and CEO of digital asset bank Custodia Bank (formerly known as Avanti), said in a tweet that this provision isn’t new and is an inherent problem with the regulatory structure used by most custodians.  ""Wyoming addressed this by creating a new customer-friendly structure designed to respect segregation of customer assets in bankruptcy, the Wyoming special-purpose depository institution,"" she said.

With web3, individuals will get paid for their time spent online. They will also be able to own and control their data as part of Web 3.0. Cloud computing refers to the supply of computer services over the internet (the cloud). It includes servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence. Cloud computing is a term coined from earlier telecom network schematics. The public telephone network (the internet) was depicted as a cloud to indicate that it did not matter where your location was. You could access it from any location. However, many clients still have concerns about locating their data and services. Collaboration of Web3 and Cloud Computing: Web3 Cloud Computing Web3 and cloud computing are two emerging technologies that could profoundly impact how we all use the internet in the coming years. The two technologies have tremendous potential, but their impact could be even more impressive if they work together. Let&apos;s take a look at what these technologies can offer each other.

With about 19339 cryptocurrencies under the process of trading, there were 534 cryptocurrency exchanges listed on CoinMarketCap at the time of writing. Due to the high volatility of the Cryptocurrency market, investors and traders can either bear loss or profit. However, cryptocurrencies mostly keep a positive annual revenue. Some of the reasons for the positive annual revenue by these exchanges include: Revenue from listing fee Gain from trading and withdrawal Revenue from listing fees In the tokenomics of different projects, there is always some volume of the coins set aside for marketing and listing purposes. Listed projects on some top cryptocurrency exchanges cost millions of dollars after they have been checked for validity. This is one of the reasons why Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin was unhappy with the development in one of the Techcrunch Conferences.
