42426728,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwJDh,1458992574,Key Questions Every DAO Founder Should Ask,"Piers R is an Ethereum early adopter, blockchain enthusiast and co-founder of stealth startup BXD.io.  In this post, he responds to last week's opinion post by Washington, DC-based lawyer Stephen D Palley, setting forth a series of legal questions he believes innovators seeking to launch blockchain-based autonomous organizations should consider.  An Ethereum-based distributed autonomous organization (DAO) is a blockchain entity that operates according to a set of pre-defined rules that the members of the DAO help maintain and that they leverage to make collective decisions.  A DAO (which differs from other concepts like a DO) is principally created as a vehicle to achieve or maintain a shared purpose, and that will both receive and distribute funds (often in the form of cryptocurrencies or other blockchain-based tokens of value) and control actions designed to help promote or further the purpose of the DAO.  On the more mundane side, with no legal identity, owning physical assets, signing contracts with non-blockchain companies (real-world suppliers, contractors, etc) and tax issues can be difficult.  For example, it is not known:  If DAO members can claim expenses against profits?  If the DAO needs to buy a physical asset, what name goes on the paperwork?  If the DAO creates and patents intellectual property (IP), who is the registered owner?  How a DAO can own a domain while domains still need to be registered to a person or company?  How taxes should be paid if the DAO or its members make profit?  Who speaks for the DAO when signing a traditional contract and how they should prove they have authority?  Where an action is incidental to the purpose of the DAO, it is reasonable to expect a service provider (SP) will bridge this real-world gap (eg providing a one-time hardware design service).  But if something is central to the purpose of the DAO (eg ownership of the IP once the design work has been paid for), you are really going to want the DAO to be able to sign more than just smart contracts, especially if the DAO is to be able to realistically split from a SP (ie you don’t want the SP keeping an asset belonging to the DAO after the split).  On the more worrying side, with no independent legal identity for the DAO, should loss (financial or otherwise) be caused by a decision or action made by the DAO, the best choice in law is to sue all stakeholders, holding them collectively and individually liable for the decision they were party in making.  In UK and other common law jurisdictions, this is often called ""joint and several liability"" and it means that I can choose to sue everyone, but even if I can only find one person actually worth suing (ie they have the means/assets to pay), I can sue them for the entire amount I am seeking.  Then, it is up to them to find the other parties and make them pay their portion.  Scenarios where this matters  One example is if the DAO makes a decision or action that causes one or a minority of the members to experience a loss.  A simple example of this is peer-to-peer insurance: a DAO is created as a collective insurance pool.  After taking insurance premiums for a while, the DAO grows and hires a SP to help investigate some claims. A member of the DAO tries to make a claim, but it is rejected by the DAO members. The claimant believes the rejection to be groundless. The DAO also elects not to pay the SP as the members do not believe the service providers work is up to scratch.  Who does the claimant sue? Who does the SP sue?  While the terms and rules of the DAO may be incredibly well written, if they do not comply with changing local laws (eg consumer protection legislation or sale of goods and services rules), then it won’t matter how well the DAO is defined, or what kind of waivers you make people sign, it can still be sued.  Different corporate structures  Limited liability companies (LLCs) were created to help solve some of these issues. It gives a collection of individuals a legal identity that can enter into contracts and be held liable for its actions, but that limits the liability of those individuals to no more than the money they had already committed to the company.  In the UK, there are several forms of limited liability organizations – this post will focus on:  Companies limited by shares (LBS)  Companies limited by guarantee (LBG)  Companies limited by shares.  Generally speaking, a company limited by shares is designed explicitly for the making of profit for its shareholders. This is the most common form of company, and the total amount of money its shareholders can be pursued for (after net assets are taken account of) is the capital invested by the shareholders.  For strictly for-profit DAOs, the structure may work as follows.  The members of the DAO are shareholders and they must purchase shares in the DAO when these shares are offered for sale or when the company is created (as part of the founding share capital).  If further members wish to join the DAO, they must purchase shares in the company at the market rate, either from existing shareholders, or as part of a further capital raise. As the value of the DAO increases (providing dilution is less than value creation), so does the value of the shares in the entity.  Directors are appointed to the board by the shareholders – generally speaking those with the most shares are those that get a seat/choose someone to represent them on the board.  The main drawbacks with a company limited by shares for a DAO is that the corporate control of the DAO may be purchased simply by purchasing enough shares to have a simple majority.  This potentially puts the control of DAO-owned, non-blockchain based assets (such as IP, property, listed stocks, etc) with the majority owners of the company, despite the best efforts to avoid centralization of control in the DAO rules.  Companies limited by guarantee  Companies limited by guarantee (LBG) are not designed explicitly for profit, and are normally formed as social enterprises or community organisations.  Instead of investing capital into the company to become a shareholder and thus looking for a return on that investment, companies limited by guarantee (LBG) are instead limited by the guarantee of its members.  This is so that, in the event of the company being closed down, the members are liable up to the amount of the guarantee only. Generally, this is a nominal amount like £1 per member.  For entities such as a DAO, LBG companies look very appealing.  For one, they are not explicitly formed for profit, and are instead formed to carry out an ""objective"". No one person can control a majority of corporate decision making simply by buying it, instead you can make each new member of the DAO a member of the LBG entity as well, giving all a voice in both.  It gives a way of separating the issue of corporate legal control from the ownership/rights to profits in the DAO.  For example, a DAO could be incorporated as a LBG, but then issue and sell tokens to members that give them rights to profits made by the DAO (eg crypto shares such as those that startup Slock.it plans to issue).  This effectively creates a for-profit DAO, but it is harder to undo by a majority ownership-style attack.  For profit-making DAOs, it makes sense for the size of your membership or vote in the LBG and the size of your stake in the DAO to be linked for initial investors. Once that stake is sold on, however, the subsequent transaction does not add any value to the DAO.  Certain DAOs may then choose for membership rights to have an earn-back period to help reduce the incentive for speculative and malicious third parties to purchase shares for control of the DAO, as well as protecting the purpose and longer term members of the DAO.  Construction and relationship to the DAO  To adopt the LBG structure and give legal personhood to a DAO, the following additions or changes to the standard LBG Articles of Association (AoA) would be good to consider.  All guarantee funds could be taken upfront on the joining of the member and held in a separate blockchain-based wallets that can only be transferred to a bank account owned by the LBG company in the event of a winding up or liquidation event. This will be a £1 equivalent at the time of the membership and could be refunded one year after the member ceases to be a member (eg after leaving the DAO).  This makes sure that, should the LBG need to be liquidated, it would not be necessary to chase all the members for their guarantee payment (although if the value of the collected funds dropped below the value of total members multiplied by £1, it may still be necessary to chase people).  Membership and voting in the LBG should be linked directly to membership of the DAO, and potentially, should also include a minimum DAO membership period (to avoid spamming the DAO with bogus members to get control of the LBG entity).  This means that to become a member of the LBG, you must have been a owner or member of the DAO for one year period before membership is approved. No director may directly appointed another director. Vacant spaces for directors are either proposed by the board or by at least 5% of the members.  This proposed new director is then put to a confirmation vote by the members of the DAO. Any positive voting is problematic at scale (ie 5% of 1 million members is still 50,000 votes). Instead, I propose that instead a negative vote is put in place: the proposed new director is automatically approved after a minimum review period of 10 working days unless 5% or more of members vote against the approval.  The number of directors should be capped at a maximum (suggested nine) to avoid too many people having authority to act on behalf of the LBG. This uneven number is suggested to avoid director deadlock in decisions that are split.  Directors should also be restricted in their ability to bind the company individually, with any decision requiring the movement, divestment or purchase of assets equal to 10% or more of DAO+LBG assets to require a vote of the board and signature by two directors.  Directors should be selected on the basis of relevant skills and experience and be rotated on a staggered four-year maximum term to avoid the entire board from being replaced in one go.  While the above seems complex and bureaucratic, it is important to note that most of the liquid assets and work conducted by the DAO+LBG combo will be held and controlled directly by the DAO (ie in smart contracts and cryptocurrency).  The DAO will not need to follow anything other than it's internal logic and rules to deal with those assets. It is only when the DAO needs to contract, purchase or sell in the real world, in a scenario in which a SP cannot and should not act, that the LBG structure and it's directors would need to act on behalf of the DAO.

42394469,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bw7CGH,1458986495,"1,000 Bitcoin Wallets Won't Replace One Financial Revolution","John Biggs is CEO of stealth bitcoin startup Freemit and a former editor at TechCrunch. His work has appeared in publications such as The New York Times, Gizmodo and Men's Health.  In this opinion piece, Biggs argues that the bitcoin community has become complacent in its quest for financial change, standing by as institutions seek to stamp out its revolutionary impulses.  You say you want a revolution. Fine. But act like it's coming, not like petulant nerds intent on destroying a burgeoning industry from the inside.  At this point in the bitcoin lifecycle, the fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) and naysaying we've been hearing is mostly true. The network is abysmally slow. The use cases are half-baked and consumers will receive no implicit benefit from bitcoin over, say, swiping their Visa card.  The bitcoin 1.0 experiment is, in short, over.  But, I would argue – and you will probably agree – that bitcoin and related technologies aren't an experiment any more than TCP/IP was an experiment or HTML was a shot in the dark. Just as the first web pages looked ugly as sin, the current state of bitcoin is in the same position.  These technologies point the way to the future, but we're letting that future be controlled by those who will be quickest to destroy it.  Death by distraction  Transferwise, Revolut and the banks with their ""blockchain-like contracts"" are sucking up the oxygen necessary to go forward with a true Internet of Value.  While we dick around over block size and who is angry at whom, the powers that be are quickly and mercilessly tearing into everything that we have worked hard to build.  I have watched this industry move from ""To the moon!"" optimism to a world in which big banks pay lip service to [bitcoin creator] Satoshi Nakamoto even as they strip out the best parts of his work for themselves and leave the ""uncertainty"" to the idiots who still believe bitcoin is a currency.  At the same time, incumbent FinTech plays have gotten into bed with banks and are attempting to replicate bitcoin's benefits through financial trickery and loss-leader tactics.  False hopes  Then, there are the bitcoin 1.0 companies, the dozens of startups that are nothing more than another crypto wallet.  They’re basically software layers that allow these companies to route around regulation by claiming to be software solutions.  Bullshit. These companies need to put up or shut up.  In short, there are banks who are working hard to steal our ideas and nervous CEOs who refuse to release real products humans can use. Old-timey bitcoin companies are clamoring for the world's focus even as they fumble the ball when it comes to general bitcoin adoption.  Why are we letting them?  I'm all for happy cooperation between existing financial institutions and bitcoin. This is imperative to move forward.  If big banks want to hire blockchain consultants who will work on routing around the potential damage bitcoin can cause to their fee structure until enough of the old guard retire and enough intelligent blockchain users replace them, then that is just fine. The Internet of Value will be waiting for them.  But the longer they wait the longer they will spend money on Quixotic tools because they are afraid.  Old lessons  I'm reminded again and again of a story my friend Roy told me about his experience with the early web. In about 1999, he was tasked with maintaining Web filters for a South Korean company.  The filters cut out everything, from external email to porn. But they kept failing. He would come in every week and find that the filters were literally burning up – all of the porn was burning the filters. He'd order a new server, install it and a week later get another call.  After a few servers burnt out, he'd get a call every few days. Then once a day.  Seoul at that time was far ahead of the US in terms of web access, and users were watching TV, downloading data and communicating in ways that we hadn't yet dreamed of online. And filters were needed, obviously, to keep workers from connecting with the outside world.  The filter was designed to keep the users from cyberloafinghttp://www.siop.org/Media/News/loafing.aspx. But the filters actually just caused more downtime, frustrated more connectivity and prevented people from doing real work.  A company that filtered the Internet in 1999 was considered cautious. A company that filters the Internet today is considered dumb.  Power to the people  The same will happen with ""blockchain-only"" plays. And that's fine.  After a few dozen servers fried, Roy's client said to stop installing filters. Citibank, Credit Suisse and American Express will stop filtering bitcoin.  When that happens you'd best buckle up. This technology isn't going anywhere. But we must decide where we want it to go.  If we, as a group, want to lose this technology to the current banking powers that's fine, but be prepared to see bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies fail. If we want to work together with banks to our mutual benefit, then I can see good things ahead.  If we want to wrest control back from the banks and wage civil war between former allies, then good luck.  Linux won because of two things: the rabble – I include myself in this because I was playing with Mandrake Linux back in 2000 – took hold of it and forced it forward so corporations could recognize its power and kept the untrammeled infighting in check.  Open-source folks could play in their own sandbox and create amazing flights of programming prowess while Red Hat said ""Hey, this makes for a great web server. Why don't we replace Solaris with it.""  It was this push/pull that turned open source into a real threat and, in the end, forced Microsoft to port SQL Server to Linux.  Time for action  The revolution has begun.  It's not a revolution that many have noticed and, even with all of our bluster, it can still fail. But let's not let it.  There is no upside to abandoning one of the most unique and potentially life-saving financial technologies in the world, but there is also no upside to ignoring the problem of slow-moving major players, a petty user base that sees conspiracy in every Reddit post and bankers who chortle at blockchain in public and invest millions into it in private.  You say you want a revolution. Make one.
