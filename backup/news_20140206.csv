42397354,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaq2Bo,1391725922,Chicago Sun-Times Bitcoin Paywall Shows 25 Cents is Sweet Spot,"The Chicago Sun-Times and BitWall have released new metrics regarding their 1st February bitcoin paywall test, revealing that Sun-Times readers contributed more than 700 donations to the Taproot Foundation as part of the 24-hour trial.  Conducted last Saturday, the introductory partnership found the ninth-largest US newspaper teaming up with an emerging San Francisco startup as a way to explore its own monetization options. BitWall, on the other hand, received its first chance to launch a large-scale test of whether bitcoin micropayments could deliver for mainstream publishers.  Speaking to CoinDesk, BitWallhttp://www.bitwall.io/ CEO and co-founder Nic Meliones recounted what was at stake for his company and the wider industry:  ""The big picture was testing bitcoin as a payment method and showing that there is an appetite for consumers out there to use this technology, and do it easily,"" Meliones said.  Meliones said that on this count, both his company and bitcoin passed the test. BitWall experienced no downtime during the 24-hour period, and received positive feedback from readers, including mobile users, a key demographic given how content consumption is trending, the CEO said.  ""There were a lot of users out there on mobile, and we've been priming the product to get it ready for that, to make things as frictionless as possible,"" said Meliones.  In turn, the Sun-Times got its first glimpse of what kind of revenue micropayments could bring to its operations.  Micropayment data  Broken down by donation size, the 713 bitcoin contributors were most likely to give 25 cents - 63% of the bitcoin donations made to the Sun-Times were for payments in this denomination.        Chicago Sun-Times Bitcoin Donations by Size        As shown by this chart, perhaps most encouragingly for content providers, less than 2% of bitcoin users donated an amount of less than 25 cents, while 31% donated between 25 cents and $13 for content.  Meliones said the size of the donations was indicative of how easy it is for consumers to engage in small bitcoin payments.  Social engagement  As an alternative to bitcoin gifting, readers were also able to donate tweets in support of the Taproot Foundation.  Perhaps unsurprisingly, the test showed users were eager to receive content for providing the organization free publicity. The data shows just how much exposure publishers could gain from a social paywall. Each tweet generated an additional 38 clicks for the nonprofit.  Still, Meliones suggested bitcoin payments were the more popular option due to the high community support for the test.  ""For a lot of different publications, tweets and bitcoin donations have been in line, but in this case, bitcoin donations were more prolific,"" Meliones said.  Next steps  For now, Meliones is confident in the results and what they say about BitWall's capabilities to deliver on its value proposition. The CEO said that the test was proof that it could successfully launch its service, and do so on a platform with the kind of high-volume traffic of the Sun-Times.  While Meliones declined to comment on how talks with the Sun-Times had progressed since Saturday's test, he did indicate that conversation is still persisting between the two organizations.  ""We're still chatting on that quite a bit,"" he said.

42397352,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaq2Ap,1391722753,Gavin Andresen: It's Going to be Tough for Governments to Control Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Foundation's chief scientist Gavin Andresen addressed the subject of bitcoin regulation as part of the US Council on Foreign Relations' (CFR) latest 'Voices of the Next Generation' discussion in Washington, DC today.    During the 60-minute question-and-answer session, attendees and moderator Douglas Rediker asked Andresenhttps://bitcoinfoundation.org/about/board probing and sometimes pointed questions about the emerging virtual currency, as well as its implications for governments and the world economy.    Perhaps most notably, Andresen stated that the bitcoin community would welcome smart regulations that enhance the safety of the ecosystem:      ""Consumer protection makes sense. You should have some idea of who you're interacting with if you're trusting them with money,"" Andresen said.              Furthermore, Andresen suggested that democratic governments won't be likely to have success if they try to control bitcoin.      ""For other more liberal countries, it's going to be tough to say don't buy shoes from someone in this country because we don't like that country.""              Overall, Andresen said he did his best to ""stay humble"" while building a rapport between bitcoin and an audience that was not yet familiar with the goals and concepts driving the currency.      ""I think people love to think that there's somebody that does have all the answers, I just try to be careful to not pretend that I have some knowledge that I don't,"" Andresen told CoinDesk after the meeting.    Discussion points    [post-quote]      Despite, or perhaps because of, the open nature of the discussion, the majority of the questions focused on what could be perceived as potential weak points in Bitcoin's design.      These included queries about how much control Bitcoin Foundation members have over the Bitcoin protocol, whether bitcoin users viewed any regulation as beneficial, and whether bitcoin's deflationary nature could inhibit spending when used on a mass scale.      As a result, the tone seemed more indicative of the growing public concern over bitcoin than the tenor of the CFR's original email suggested.      ""Bitcoin is still in its early adopter phase. It's so young still, it doesn't surprise me that people don't grasp the basics,"" Andresen said.      If those asking questions were seeking more direct answers, Andresen did his best to frame bitcoin the currency as a work in progress that is seeking larger shared benefits for the world, and bitcoin the community as one where questions are always welcomed, if not yet answerable.      ""All moneys are this shared delusion. They're valuable because they say we have value. Money doesn't grow on trees,"" Andresen commented.              Like witnesses at the NYDFS hearings last month, Andresen chose to compare bitcoin to the Internet, focusing on how it could improve pain points shared by all consumers and lead to cheaper, faster and better ways of payment that promote the common good.      ""If you think about the payment systems we have today, it was created in the paper days. It's evolved, although if you try to pay somebody, it may take three to four to five days, that's kind of crazy,"" Andresen said.            A successful failure    The chief scientist also emphasized that bitcoin could still fail, and that certain unforeseeable events – such as errors with coding, or a new and improved system – could ultimately render it useless.      The problem with the current payment system, Andresen postured, is bigger than bitcoin, and may prove beyond its capabilities. He added:      ""If Bitcoin turns out to be a miserable failure, but it does encourage some government to realize that our payment systems are broken and archaic, and some country decides we're going to make a payment system for this century, I think that would be a huge success.""            ""Voices of the Next Generation"" series    Andresen's invitation to the noted CFR series inspired mixed reactions on bitcoin forums, with some viewing the invitation as a promising sign of bitcoin's increasing mainstream acceptance, and others suggesting the CFR's decision could potentially harbor more hostile motives.      Andresen has been an outspoken thought leader in the burgeoning industry, and joins other distinguished alumni of the series, including New Republic editor Peter Beinart and Eurasia Group president Ian Bremmer, on the list of those who have given talks to the CFR.    Andresen's bitcoin history    Andresen began the CFR discussion by introducing himself and his past work on bitcoin, which began in 2010. He notably mentioned Bitcoin Faucet, a now defunct project that over the course of its run ""gave away 10,000 BTC,"" which Andresen estimated to be worth $8m by today's standards.      ""Since then, my life has been endlessly fascinating,"" he remarked.      In May, Andresen sat down with CoinDesk to reveal his views on where the currency was headed. Andresen described himself as conservative – and, unsurprisingly given the day's comments, suggested that he sees government playing an increasing role in regulating virtual currency.

42397368,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaq2Ob,1391716213,Watch this Bitcoin Fanatic Shoot His iPhone After Apple Blacklists Blockchain,"Infuriated by Apple's sudden move to ban bitcoin wallet provider Blockchain from its App stores on Wednesday, the bitcoin community flocked to reddit today in a spirited and controversial showing of support for the virtual currency.      Reddit posts abounded decrying Apple's move as an anti-competitive maneuver that positions the Cupertino company against innovation and its core values.      However, there may be no more dedicated bitcoin supporter than Ryan of the YouTube video series Ryan's Range Report, a vlogger and long-range shooting devotee who found a rare combination of his passions when he blasted his iPhone 4S to pieces to voice his displeasure with Apple's decision.      The gesture was not unprompted, however, as it was in response to a reddit post by user round-peg, who engaged the reddit's bitcoin community with a unique proposition. For every 100 upvotes his post received, round-peg indicated that he would ""gift someone a Nexus 5 for a video of them smashing their iPhone"".      At press time, the post had received more than 2,400 upvotes, and 1,037 comments. Though, notably, round-peg's account was no longer accessible. Round-peg was likely banned for his open solicitation of upvoting, which was in violation of reddit's rules.    Rules of engagement    Round-peg did put a cap on his philanthropy, noting in his post that his offer would extend for ""up to 500 upvotes (5 devices)"", and that new phones would be distributed on a ""first-come, first serve"" basis. The user eventually expanded this limit to include six videos.      Round-peg also listed the criteria videos needed to meet to be eligible, which was taken down and later reposted:    The device must be an iPhone 5 or 5S running iOS7  The video must be uploaded to YouTube and publicly accessible  The video must show the participants face, name and why they are smashing the iPhone  The link must be posted in the initial thread.    The reddit user also posted a number of additional considerations that he felt participants should take into account before creatively discarding their iPhones. Interestingly, round-peg takes his name from a famous Apple commercial:    “Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.”  iPhone fury unleashed    Whatever response roung-peg expected, it was clear that the offer struck a chord in a community that felt betrayed by a company many had come to view as the preeminent voice in the tech industry.      User netpastor took round-peg up on this offer, posting a two-minute video of himself reading round-peg's conditions and ultimately smashing his iPhone 5 with a metal bar.    ""This is a game changing decision on Apple's part, and the Bitcoin community won't take it lying down. I'm not a spokesperson, just someone who's very unhappy with this dishonorable action by Apple,"" netpastor, who goes by the YouTube name Boanerges, wrote in the post.  Round-peg followed up this show of support, with a comment indicating that the replacement phone had been purchased as promised.    User upgradesolution voiced his support with what appeared to be a tire iron.      ""I'm about to destroy my iPhone 5 32G, because Apple has decided to block bitcoin apps on their app store.""                  Reddit user OscarChapa_ felt similarly, also citing Apple's stance toward the NSA as a factor.          ""Apple has decided to effectively block any advances in bitcoin and any sort of cryptocurrency, and for a company that promotes any kind of futurism, that is not acceptable,"" he said before taking a machete to his device.              User Downhill280Z took a more soft-spoken approach, dropping his iPhone down a flight of stairs.    User huskyminers chose the wrench as his weapon of choice:  Controversy    Stacy Herbert, co-host of the Keiser Report on RT, told CoinDesk that the community reaction is a strong sign that Apple's policies are beginning to alienate core users.      ""This decision will ultimately have a bigger negative impact on Apple than it will on bitcoin. Once you become as uncool as Microsoft, it's hard to ever get that groove back. Apple's mistake, however, will be someone else's gain. I would think that immediately, for example, Android smartphones will be the big winner. And we see that with the smashing iPhone videos,"" Herbert said.              Though some community members chose to view the events as a show of support in the face of Apple's seemingly staunch resistance to bitcoin, others were less amused.      Some redditors suggested that the contest was in poor spirit and that it reflected negatively on bitcoin and the wider community.    What's your opinion of the iPhone smashings? Weigh in below.

42397353,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaq29q,1391712217,Venture Capitalists and Bitcoin Companies React to Apple’s Blockchain Ban,"News that Apple had pulled the Blockchain.info app from its App Store broke in the early hours of this morning (UK-time) and the short-term effect seemed to be a dip in the price of bitcoin.  At midnight (GMT), the price was $822. Some 15 minutes later, Blockchain tweeted its response to Apple's decision and, over the course of the next hour, the bitcoin price fell to $793. By 08:30, the price had fallen to $783.04, the lowest it has been since 2nd January.  At the time of writing, the price is back up to $802, but this is still 8% lower than yesterday's high of $874.  Jeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle, the bitcoin company that raised $9m in funding last year, said he's not convinced the price drop was caused by Apple's actions. He said:  ""The volume of bitcoin that is traded each day is so small that just one person, maybe a large miner who is selling BTC to get liquidity, can move the price. So price fluctuations are often absolutely nothing to do with what's going on in the news.""  Nic Cary, CEO of Blockchain agreed, adding that any time significant news breaks about bitcoin, the price moves one way or the other. However, he doesn't consider the latest price drop to be an issue.  ""Bitcoin is extremely resilient. I'm confident the price will rebound quickly. Bitcoin is impervious to Apple's app store policies,"" he said.  The effect on VC activity  Cary also doesn't think Apple's decision will have any wider-reaching implications. He certainly doesn't think the move will put a dampener on VC activity in the bitcoin space.  [post-quote]  ""VCs understand that Apple's harsh anti-Bitcoin policy is nothing new. Coinbase raised $25 million after their app was yanked last year,"" he said. ""The largest migration of human and financial capital is underway into bitcoin projects and we're just getting started.""  Jeremy Allaire also doesn't think Venture Capital firms will be put off investing in bitcoin companies because of Apple's harsh stance on digital currency apps.  ""Quality VC firms are not news-driven in their decisions. Those that are excited about bitcoin are taking a long view and are interested in how the space is going to evolve,"" he said.  Allaire believes companies can build ""outstanding"" applications that can be used on iOS in a browser and that these can accomplish 99% of what can be done in a native app.  VC activity in the bitcoin space certainly doesn't appear to be slowing down. Blockchain, BitPay and Bitstamp are all rumoured to be in the process of raising mammoth funding rounds.  Losing favour  It's evident that Apple's actions have lost it a fair few fans over the past 24 hours. Twitter, Reddit and other forums are awash with negative comments aimed at the tech giant.  Barry Silbert, CEO of Second Market and founder of the Bitcoin Investment Trust, voiced his disappointment in a tweet:    Disappointing to see @Apple turn its back on millions of bitcoin users worldwide. I'll be buying a new phone asap http://t.co/x5Rwfy5ugr      — Barry Silbert (@barrysilbert) February 6, 2014    Twitter user Bitrific was equally disgruntled by the move:    Goodbye to my iPhone and iPad - Never Again Any Apple Product: After banning blockchain app from the store, I ... http://t.co/VvVv3tpHnw      — B I T R I F I C (@bitrific) February 6, 2014    Ex-Facebook executive Chamath Palihapitiya threw in his two cents' worth, too:    $AAPL blocking blockchain makes me think: 1) they will legislate where they can't innovate 2) creates huge motivation to move to android      — Chamath Palihapitiya (@chamath) February 6, 2014    Cary said his company has received a ""tremendous response"" from the bitcoin community, in the form of hundreds of supportive comments and messages.  He went on to stress Blockchain isn't giving up and highlighted that his colleagues have already started engineering an HTML5 app that will launch soon on Blockchain.com.  ""Of course, users can download our Android app anytime - in fact, it's having a record day. Apple is losing ground across the world and they will find themselves on the wrong side of history here. We'll just leapfrog them,"" Cary concluded.  Eradicating competition  Allaire speculated that there are two possible reasons why Apple has banned bitcoin wallet apps. The first is conservatism – that the company is fearful of the perceived risk that comes with bitcoin.  Those on the risk assessment side of Apple's policy team may be looking at the bitcoin-associated federal indictments, law enforcement actions and money laundering stories that are flying around and decide it's safest to steer clear, at least for the time being.  The second motive Allaire suggests is that Apple wishes to cordon off and gain a position of advantage in the digital payments space. He said:  ""Apple's iBeacon and Bluetooth protocols are very clearly designed for payments. Those two things are proprietary – no one can use them, and I think it's very clear that Apple is planning to introduce its own digital wallet.""  He doesn't, however, believe the company will launch its own digital currency, just that it will maintain an advantage in digital payments by blocking bitcoin apps that can be used for sending and receiving funds.  Allaire believes that if this were the case, though, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) would step in to prevent Apple from using the App Store to monopolise the market.  ""There is precedent for this,"" he said. ""When the iPhone came out and Google wanted to launch Google Voice as an app on iOS, Apple banned it and wouldn't approve any voice apps. The FCC then took action.""  For the mean time, Apple is sticking to its guns and making it extremely difficult for bitcoiners to stay loyal to the brand. Something tells me Android is going to see a spike in new users over the coming days.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/02/06/venture-capitalists-and-bitcoin-companies-react-to-apples-blockchain-ban,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6638b5d9e4e41d18e3be48ad49ec29221d5b5d1b-1024x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397362,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaq2Jg,1391711263,Perseus Telecom Partners With GoCoin to Accept Bitcoin,"Perseus Telecom, a high-speed, heavy-bandwidth communications channel provider for major global stock and securities exchanges, has revealed today that it will accept bitcoin payments.    Perseus connects hedge funds, high-speed trading firms, media organizations and stock exchanges in the world's top trading centers, including: Brazil, Dublin, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, London, Madrid, Moscow, New York, Stockholm and Tokyo.      Commenting on the news, Jock Percy, Perseus' CEO, called bitcoin ""a valuable digital asset and form of payment"", and indicated in an interview that it was not the company's traditional financial services clients that brought about the decision.      Rather, Percy noted it was his customers who provide online gaming to worldwide players who were the key drivers:      ""They reached out to us and a couple of them said: 'We would like to pay in bitcoin because it's the currency of our user base.'""            Positioning for expansion    Still, Percy, who joined the company in 2010, sees its bitcoin decision as one that positions it for future growth in customer bases that have yet to emerge.      For example, the CEO said he expects an expansion in bitcoin transactions throughout the financial services and securities trading sectors in the future.      However, until then, expansion is expected to continue rapidly in the gaming sector, as more major online gaming providers begin experimenting with and accepting bitcoin.      Of course, certain aspects of the deal are geared toward limiting Perseus' short-term risk from bitcoin's price volatility.      The company selected Singapore and California-based bitcoin payment gateway GoCoin as its processor, and under the terms of the deal, Perseus may choose whether to receive bitcoin payments in BTC or convert all or part of its payments into USD.    GoCoin's latest customer    Founded in 2013, GoCoin is one of the newer payment processors serving the industry, though, it is already making headlines for its funding and innovative service features.      In November, the company raised $550,000 as part of a seed funding round led by a former COO of Facebook, and in January if became one of the first bitcoin processors to begin accepting litecoin.      GoCoin Chairman Brock Pierce weighed in on the impact of the news, saying that it shows that the traditional financial services industry is realizing bitcoin is ""something that they should at least be thinking about"", if not embracing.    Opening the B2B market    Perseus' acceptance is likely to be seen as a boon for bitcoin, given its status as a reputable supplier of services to major traditional financial exchanges and a major player in the business-to-business (B2B) sector.    As executives in the developing world have noted, one of the as-yet-untapped benefits of bitcoin could be its ability to remove restrictions on global trade that are caused by a lack of financial services.  Perseus' acceptance of bitcoin, if successful, could be another step toward raising awareness and spurring this adoption.

42397351,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaq27s,1391707798,Butterfly Labs Faces $5 Million Lawsuit Over Unfulfilled Order,"Butterfly Labs  is facing a lawsuit for over $5 million that alleges that it was negligent in its business dealings, and even accuses the company of downright fraud.  The suit was brought by Martin Meissner, who placed a $62,000 order for BFL miners back in March 2013. Meissner claims he did not received the units or a refund for his payment, according to a report in Ars Technica.  The suit was filed in December, and it accuses Butterfly Labs of fraud, negligent representation and breach of contract.  Motion to dismiss  Butterfly Labs and its attorneys refused to comment on the matter, but Meissner’s attorney, Robert Flynn, was keen to share his views, saying to Ars Technica that he has been contracted by multiple people with similar complaints, but this is the first one to result in a lawsuit.  Although Butterfly Labs isn’t talking, it is making some legal moves. Earlier this week, the company filed a motion to dismiss Meissner’s claims, arguing that it does not state a claim that can be compensated.  The plaintiff “is not entitled to consequential damages as a matter of law because they are too speculative,” the company said.  Delays and disputes  On March 25, 2013, Meissner ordered two 1,500 GH/s bitcoin miners (product code MRG015T) and transferred $62,598 to Butterfly Labs. The contract stated that initial shipments were expected in April, but, since products are shipped according to the order queue, Meissner would get them “two months or more after order.”  Things quickly went downhill from there. In May, Butterfly Labs told Meissner that they received his payment, but they were unable to match it to any order until they got an email from him. Butterfly Labs invoiced him the same day. However, Meissner’s miners were not shipped. Instead Butterfly Labs offered to ship him six 500GH/s miners but it is unclear whether Meissner accepted or refused the offer.  This is where it gets a bit blurry, but, in any case, Meissner did not receive the 500 GH/s miners, either.  In mid-October, Meissner’s lawyer sent the company a letter, saying that any shipment at such a late date would be refused. Butterfly Labs refused his request for a refund, saying that all sales are final. However, Meissner argues that no sale was ever made, since he never got the product.  ‘Speculative claim’  The most obvious question is why Butterfly Labs allowed the dispute to escalate and get them in the news. After all, it could have refunded Meissner and sold the miners to someone else, when they become available.  There is a bit of a problem, though. Meissner is not just asking for his $62,000 back – he also wants compensation for lost revenue. The complaint states that Meissner missed out on an opportunity to mine between $5- and $7.5-million worth of bitcoins.  The complaint states  :  “Plaintiff Martin Meissner prays for judgment in his favor, and against Defendant BF Labs Inc., on all claims; that the Court award him the full extent of his damages, including direct damages of $62,632.19 and consequential damages in excess of $5,000,000.00; for costs and attorneys’ fees; and for all such other relief as the Court deems just and equitable.”  This is probably why Butterfly Labs insists his damage claims are “speculative” and dismisses them outright.  Call in the jury  Butterfly Labs blames Meissner for the mess, insisting that his order was not finalised. Although it received the payment in March, it could not tie it to any existing order, as it did not include an order number. The company then waited for Meissner to get in touch, which he did in May.  A Butterfly Labs document sheds more light on the matter: “In the case of the product generation (65nm) that the Plaintiff pre-ordered, BF Labs experienced technical delays in its development that held up manufacturing the new technology at commercial scale”. It continues:  “When BF Labs had resolved the issues and was ready to commit the orders to the final stages of manufacture, an email notice was sent to customers advising that orders would be shipped as produced and that if anyone was unwilling to endure the wait, they had a final opportunity to cancel their order and receive a full refund.”  In addition, the company points out that it increased its prices in April 2013, following a rise in the price of bitcoin. Since Meissner’s order was not finalized, Butterfly Labs assumed it was abandoned when he did not reply to the email notice.  This is not the first legal dispute involving a mining hardware company and it probably won’t be the last. There are always risks involved with pre-ordering untested and unproven silicon, regardless of legal fine print. In this particular case, it may be that both parties share at least part of the blame, but that’s ultimately for a jury to decide.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | REGULATION | TRADING,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2014/02/06/butterfly-labs-faces-5-million-lawsuit-over-unfulfilled-order,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f4df61194c5fea15fbcce2365003d5c40f9d28a2-1010x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397363,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaq2Kf,1391697974,57% of Young Americans Believe Bitcoin Boosts Global Economy,"The majority of young consumers in the US believe that bitcoin 'helps the global economy', a new survey commissioned by The Street has revealed.  57% of the 18- to 25-year-olds that took part in the nationwide GfK survey believe bitcoin benefits the global economy, while 33% believe it helps the US dollar.  It seems younger consumers are more comfortable with bitcoin than their parents or grandparents. This is not surprising, as previous surveys have indicated that younger generations are more open to digital currencies like bitcoin and litecoin.  What is surprising is the fact that the 50- to 65-year-olds that took part showed the greatest familiarity with bitcoin, at 30%.  Of the 18-24 year-olds quizzed, 32% said they would consider using alternative currencies, versus just 11% of those over the age of 65. In addition, 15% of the younger age bracket would rather own bitcoins than gold, versus 14% of those over 65.  However, the vast majority of consumers in the US haven’t heard of bitcoin and wouldn’t use it, either.  The nationwide survey found that American consumers are not only unfamiliar with bitcoin, they are uncomfortable with the idea of holding and using it.  Of those surveyed, 76% said they are not familiar with bitcoin, while 79% said they have never and would never consider using alternative currencies.  ""If the survey says that 24% of Americans have heard about bitcoin then I’m pleased. I would honestly rather that the other 76% weren’t yet on board as it’s still not ready for prime-time,"" said Paul Gordon, organiser of London's CoinScrum bitcoin meetups.  Interestingly, 38% believe bitcoin “hurts” the US dollar, while 80% said they would rather own gold than bitcoins.  Across income brackets  ""While bitcoin has attracted the attention of influential hedge fund managers and the research desks of major US banks, an overwhelming majority of Americans remain unaware of cryptocurrency,"" said Joe Deaux, The Street's Economics Analyst, adding:  ""Bitcoin's supporters would argue that the virtual currency remains in its infancy and that a year ago most of Wall Street hadn't heard of it, but The Street's survey shows that there isn't great deviation across income brackets as to how many people know about bitcoin, own bitcoin and prefer it to owning gold.""  In contrast, Gordon said he's currently excited by the pace at which bitcoin foundations are being developed across the world, so that wider adoption can occur in a ""more secure and user-friendly environment"".  ""Our CoinScrum networking and learning group in London, which is now the largest of its kind in the world with over 1,250 members, has seen a 100-fold increase in membership in the last year alone and we attracted 250 people to our most recent event,"" he added.  A recent survey by Bloomberg found that 42% of Americans were able to correctly identify bitcoin as a digital currency. However, 6% of participants mistook it for an iPhone app and another 6% believed it was an Xbox game.  Tech in Motion recently carried out a survey among tech professionals and found that 51% would like to be paid in bitcoin, while 18% said they would wait and see what happens to the currency over the next couple of years.  ""I remain convinced that bitcoin, along with the various technologies it has already spawned, is on the right trajectory,"" concluded Gordon.

42397364,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaq2Md,1391694304,Leading Anti-Malware Firm Malwarebytes Starts Accepting Bitcoin,"Leading anti-malware software provider Malwarebytes has announced its decision to accept bitcoin payments.  The company  has been fascinated with bitcoin ever since its inception, and has followed the currency's evolution closely.  “As a leader in security, we are excited to accept a crypto currency that provides a level of anonymity to our security-conscious customers,” said Marcin Kleczynski, CEO of Malwarebytes.  “Protecting customer privacy is part of our DNA, and taking payment in bitcoins is a logical extension of that ethos. We think the story behind Bitcoin is an exciting one as well, and we’re thrilled to support the bitcoin community. Malwarebytes is a forward-leaning company, and this is a natural fit.”  Malwarebytes has been an advocate of online privacy rights for years, and has integrated powerful anti-spyware detection in its software suites.  This approach seems to be paying off, as the company is one of the most popular anti-malware solutions on the market. Hence, its decision to accept bitcoin payments can be viewed as an extension of its rigorous privacy policies.  Going live  Malwarebytes teamed up with Coinbase to process the transactions for the service, which is already live on the Malwarebytes website.  However, for the time being, the offer is limited to the Malwarebytes Anti-Malware Pro suite (priced at $24.95 worth of BTC). Future products that can be purchased with the cryptocurrency will have a bitcoin logo displayed on the page.  Although privacy and bitcoin go hand in hand, the same is true of malware, to a certain extent. Many malware makers are 'using' bitcoin, too.  The currency's relative anonymity allows them to cash out easily before they get caught, to transfer funds or pay fellow malware makers for various services rendered in the darker corners of the Internet.  Bitcoin-mining malware  Some malware makers have even devised bitcoin-mining malware that relies on huge botnets to mine coins, but so far these attempts have had very limited success.  Yahoo was recently involved in a security breach that could have exposed up to two million European computers with mining malware. However, in reality the number of devices infected appears to be much lower.  Similarly, in late 2013, Microsoft moved to dismantle the Sefnit botnet which hijacked vulnerable versions of the Tor browser.

The comments bear similarities to others released over the past few months, but suggest the government will now take a hands-off approach to digital currency. Today's statement differs slightly from the reports issued last month, in which Bank Indonesia's deputy Governor suggested digital currency might break the bank's rules.  Since then, representatives from the local bitcoin business community have participated in informal discussions with regulators to clarify the boundaries of their operating environment. The latest statement reads (translated from Indonesian):    ""Noting the Law no. 7 of 2011 on Currency and the Law no. 23 of 1999 which was amended several times, most recently by Act no. 6 In 2009, Bank Indonesia states that the virtual currency bitcoin and others do not constitute currency or legal tender in Indonesia.      People are encouraged to be careful of bitcoin and other virtual currencies. All risks related to ownership/use of bitcoin will be borne by the owner/user of the virtual currency bitcoin and others.""    Bitcoin businesses  Local bitcoin entrepreneur Oscar Darmawan was optimistic about the statement, saying bitcoin users can now move foward with plans to promote its use in the world's fourth-largest country by population.  ""We are really glad for that stance. It seems Indonesia Central Bank's final stance will be in neutral position and will not prohibit bitcoin in Indonesia. Indonesia will regulate bitcoin as an e-commodity instead of e-currency.""  He added: ""Indonesia will have bright future for bitcoin to grow as 'media transfer' for payments, instead of for e-currency – as it should be. The stance will also means bitcoin will be regulated in the same way as Singapore did. Really thank you to our government.""  Darmawan, who also heads Indonesia's largest bitcoin exchange Bitcoin.co.id and was a key participant in the discussions, said he also plans to introduce the country's first bitcoin ATM soon and hopes the government's clarification would make bitcoin investors more comfortable about reaching out to local startups.  Despite a population of over 240 million and membership in the G20 group of world's major economies, Indonesia's bitcoin scene is relatively small.  A clear hands-off approach could see it grow soon, reaching out first to a young and technology-friendly public in large cities like Jakarta, and then possibly to millions of unbanked and under-banked people in regional locales.

42425410,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwTth,1391686829,"You Can Now Pay Cash For Bitcoin at 28,000 UK Stores","Bitcoiners can now pay cash for bitcoins at 28,000 shops across the UK, thanks to a new service set up by ZipZap.  The service enables people to head to their nearest ZipZap payment location, hand over cash and see bitcoins deposited in their wallets almost instantly.  Currently available via Bittylicious, BuyBitcoin.sg and BIPS Market, the service will go live with ANXBTC and ANXPRO next week, followed by Kraken, CoinMKT and BTCX.se.  Customers simply have to log into their accounts with one of these companies and select the cash payment option, they then choose the amount of bitcoins they want to purchase and head to their local ZipZap payment location to complete the transaction.  Thousands of independent local shops are registered as ZipZap locations, as are Spar, Asda, Tesco Express branches and many other stores across the country.  The minimum a user can choose to spend is £10 and the maximum per transaction is £300, but up to four transactions can be completed per customer, per day.  Lasse Birk Olesen, founder and CEO of BuyBitcoin.sg, said: ""We are very excited to present the easiest and fastest way to buy bitcoins in United Kingdom! This is a key piece of infrastructure that allows bitcoin to grow further in the UK.""  He went on to say that, after a customer pays in cash, their bitcoins are delivered ""within minutes"", adding:  ""No more waiting for days for bank transfers – this is as fast as it gets and makes bitcoin more attractive.""  Marc Warne, CEO of Bittylicious, is equally excited by the new service he is able to offer his customers.  ""This is a really neat way for people in the UK to get their hands on bitcoins,"" he said.  Testing the service  I tested out the service using Bittylicious. I have to admit, I was a bit sceptical at first – why would I bother going through the effort of visiting a shop to buy bitcoins when I could do it all online? However, I found the whole process incredibly simple, and I can see why some people would prefer it and would enjoy the novelty of handing over physical cash for digital currency.  While Bittylicious currently enables unregistered users to buy small amounts of bitcoins via bank transfer and Barclays Pingit, it doesn't allow them to use the cash payment service. This means you have to register with the company and submit identity documents (to comply with anti-money-laundering and know-your-customer rules).  Warne told me ID verification on Bittylicious currently takes 12 hours, on average, but the company is working on reducing this over the course of the next few days.  I'm already registered and verified with Bittylicious, so I just logged in, then the home page displayed the ""Cash Payment"" option.  After entering my bitcoin wallet address and selecting the amount in BTC or GBP I wanted to purchase, I was told I had 30 minutes to choose my payment location and confirm the trade.  I entered my postcode to find my nearest ZipZap payment location and found there were 13 shops for me to choose from within a radius of around 0.6 miles (bear in mind the CoinDesk office is in central London).  After selecting my most convenient shop, I hit the ""I am ready to pay"" button and was provided with a PDF document to print. This features all the order details, the address and a map of my chosen payment centre, plus the barcode required by the shopkeeper.  Bittylicious gives you a leisurely two hours to complete the payment and the PDF payment slip details the time by which the transaction must be finalised.  Once in the shop, I handed over the payment slip to the newsagent, he scanned the barcode, I handed over the cash, he printed a receipt and that was that. (You don't actually have to print the payment slip – you can just bring the barcode up on your smartphone and have the shopkeeper scan it straight from there.)  Precisely eight minutes later, the BTC arrived in my bitcoin wallet.  The verdict  Being able to pay cash over the counter for bitcoin was pretty cool – experiencing the ultimate transition from old money to new money. But aside from that, I'm not entirely sure what the major benefits are for someone like me, who has a bank account and can use a fast bank transfer to receive their bitcoins quickly and easily, without having to venture into the great outdoors.  It's also worth bearing in mind you pay a premium to use this service. At the time of writing, the exchange rate displayed on Bittylicious for cash payments was £537.80 per bitcoin, which is quite a bit higher than the £520 per bitcoin if paying via bank transfer, and greater still than the £517.18 displayed on the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index at the time.  Some say they are attracted to the service as it allows consumers to remain anonymous, because their bank accounts aren't involved. However, given that the service can't be used without first registering with one of the bitcoin companies listed above, customers don't actually remain completely anonymous.  Warne said that, regardless, the service will appeal to those who want to buy bitcoins without involving their bank in any way.  He said: ""It's not really about getting bitcoins anonymously. It's more about getting them without needing to rely on any other institutions.""  He added:  ""Some people don't have bank accounts, have unsuitable bank accounts or simply don't want to associate their bank account with bitcoins, so this is perfect for them.""  According to research by Social Finance, more than 1.5 million adults in the UK are unbanked (do not have access to a transactional bank account), so I can see that there is a sector of society that would find this service extremely useful.  If/when it becomes available in countries where the majority of the population is unbanked, I can see the service really starting to take off.  Upcoming developments  Currently the barcodes featured on the payment slips are single use only, however, ZipZap is working on creating a system that will produce a reusable barcode. This will enable customers to 'top up' their bitcoin wallet with funds without having to go online each time to confirm their payment.  ""A lot of people are put off investing in or purchasing bitcoin as they see the process as too complicated. ZipZap aims to change this, making it easier and faster for people to swap their money for bitcoins,"" said Eric Benz, VP of business development at ZipZap.  He went on to say his company aims to roll out the cash-for-bitcoins service globally, though ZipZap wouldn’t confirm which territories will be next, or when.  The company is also looking to expand its service so that people can exchange their funds the other way around, swapping their bitcoins for cash over the counter.  As for developments set to take place specifically here in the UK, Warne (of Bittylicious) hinted that the service could soon also be available for altcoins, such as litecoin and peercoin.  ""Although not available yet, there's no reason why the altcoins on Bittylicious shouldn't be available for cash too in the near future,"" he explained.

42425405,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwTlh,1391682583,Latin American Exec: Employees Could Earn 5% More with Bitcoin,"Bitcoin's potential to cut credit and debit transaction fees and exchange rate costs is often seen as its biggest advantage to international businesses.  However, to entrepreneurs in developing countries the virtual currency represents an even greater opportunity: the end to costly trade restrictions that inhibit their profits and ability to compete.  Ulf Kuhn, founder of Chile-based telemarketing business Telemarketing Facil, has learned this lesson firsthand. The German native moved to Chile three years ago to export business ideas and learn more about developing markets.  However, he soon found that the traditional banking system was there to impede his efforts every step of the way. During his relocation, Kuhn says he was ""scammed"" with 25% percent transaction fees for international bank transfers and money transfers.  Since launching Telemarketing Facil in 2013, he hasn't exactly found the banking environment more accommodating.  Traditional banking complications  To begin, Kuhn reports that even paying employees via the current banking system is difficult, given that his business serves all of Latin America.  With employees based in Mexico and Colombia, workers incur additional costs in the form of currency exchange rates as well as bank and payment provider fees. As a result, the payment process at Telemarketing Facil works like this:  A client pays Telemarketing Facil, the funds enter its Chilean peso account.  Telemarketing Facil pays its advertising, phone service and software costs in USD.  Telemarketing Facil converts Chilean pesos to USD, then to their employees' local currency at a roughly 4% exchange rate.  To transfer funds to employees, Telemarketing Facil uses PayPal, which is subject to an additional 5% fee.  ""Our employees could earn 5% more,"" Kuhn said.  Fees don't just directly impact transactions at Telemarketing Facil, however. Kuhn says the company loses clients because its invoices don't include bank fees. Still, it could be worse, Kuhn notes. If Telemarketing Facil was based in Argentina, it might not be able to exist at all.  ""We would have to charge Argentinian peso. After that, people could send us money only with the Argentine official exchange rate – that is about 30%.""  Bitcoin's emerging solution  There is one potential remedy to Kuhn's challenge – virtual currency. The entrepreneur believes that widespread bitcoin use in his market this would revolutionize his ability to conduct business.  Kuhn began accepting bitcoin on 17th January after attending a bitcoin meetup where he spoke with Nicolas Cary, CEO of Blockchain.info, about bitcoin and its potential use in international business.  Should all its clients pay in bitcoin or use the technology for payments, Telemarketing Facil's payment process would include fewer steps and fees:  The client pays in bitcoin, Telemarketing Facil starts service eight business days earlier.  Telemarketing Facil pays its advertising, phone service and software costs in USD.  Telemarketing Facil allows employees to decide whether to be paid in BTC or by bank transfer at an additional cost.  Sluggish adoption    While promising, such a scenario is unfortunately not on the horizon for Telemarketing Facil. Kuhn notes that he hasn't had any customers yet take advantage of the new payment option, though some tech startups with USD bank accounts have expressed interest.      [post-quote]    Furthermore, Kuhn says that there are some problems that need solving before bitcoin takes off in the B2B space. He cited that easy escrow payments, as well as clarity by governments on bitcoin's tax status would be beneficial.  Existing players in the bitcoin ecosystem could do more as well. Kuhn noted that it's currently too difficult to get bitcoins because big trading platforms don't have bank accounts in Chile.  But, Kuhn isn't discouraged, as he understands that adoption will take time.  “I see a big potential for B2B bitcoin transactions for exporting companies, especially in Argentina, Colombia, Chile and Peru,"" he said.

42425401,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwTZh,1391673681,Mazacoin Aims to be Sovereign Altcoin for Native Americans,"Iceland may be the first nation to get its own cryptocurrency, but if Payu Harris has his way, it won't be the last. This week, he hopes to mine the genesis block for mazacoin, an altcoin for the native American nation in the US.  Specifically designed for the Traditional Lakota Nation, mazacoin is initially being targeted at the Oglala Lakota Nation, which is Harris' own tribe. He works at Kimitsu Asset Management, which is focused on creating a bitcoin-based native American tribal cryptocurrency.  Harris is launching the altcoin under the Bitcoin Oyate Projecthttp://www.hyjinxentertainment.com/kam/oyate.htm, and hopes it will give native American communities some fiscal autonomy.  ""One of the favorite tactics used by the Dept of Interior and the local State Government is to threaten to freeze bank accounts if the tribe takes a position that could challenge a State or federal interest,"" he alleged.  Harris argued that the tactic has been used several times before against tribes operating casinos. ""An independent crypto currency would eliminate the State/Federal ability to freeze accounts and tamper with lawful tax revenues,"" he said.  The mechanics of mazacoin  Mazacoin (MZC) is based on the Zetacoin altcoin, which is in turn based on bitcoin's SHA-256 proof of work implementation. This coin will have a block target of 120 seconds, and a block reward of 5000 MZC.  Unlike bitcoin, there won't be a cap. The developers expect 2.4192 billion of the coins to be mined in the first five years, with a further million per year. Removing the cap is intended as an anti-deflationary measure.  The coin won't all be mined by the community, however; there will be a limited two-stage pre-mine. Harris said that this is meant to build up a reserve of the coins, so that others without the ability to mine can still be a part of mazacoin and can exchange goods and services for it on a local exchange. It's an anti-hoarding measure, he suggested.  During the first pre-mine, 25 million coins will be created for the Lakota nation as a cryptocurrency reserve, which will be used for future price stabilization. A second pre-mine will generate another 25 million MZC, which will be given to a new entity: the Mazacoin Tribal Trust.  The Trust will award MZC grants to individual tribal members, businesses, or charities within the Lakota Nation. Grants will range up to 50,000 MZC for charities.  Anti-deflation  Anti-deflation is an important feature for a coin like mazacoin, which is designed to be used practically by the native American community, said 'Anonymous Pirate' (AP), an anonymous Canadian cryptocurrency expert and self-described hacktivist who created the coin for Harris. He also runs CryptoDirect, a trading site for altcoin miners.  ""Bitcoin will always be useful, as a store of mass value like gold bars. But gold bars are not what you bring to the corner store to buy groceries,"" said AP. ""The ideal merchantable value for mazacoin would be between 3 and 5 dollars USD. That would make it portable and easy to use/adopt.""  Harris sees the pre-mine as a means of fairly distributing wealth. ""The crushing poverty makes the redistribution necessary if we are to ensure that mazacoin is circulating in the tribal economy,"" he says.  According to the US government census, the median household income of single-race native American households was $35,410 in 2012. This is just over two thirds of the national average. 29% of native Americans were in poverty that year, which is almost twice the national average.  One other way for tribal communities to get in on the coin is to mine it. Harris says that there is talk of a mining pool based on a tribal reserve, and he had been collecting donations for GPU-based miners.  [post-quote]  Harris wants mazacoin to stretch beyond those borders to be used by other tribal groups. Governance of the coin will vary between tribes, he explains.  ""If a tribe forms a update or brings up a direction they feel is important, representative for each tribes Economic Development Administrations or crypto currency development directors can come together and vote on adoption by other regions or tribal governments,"" Payu concluded.  Mazacoin plans to mine the genesis block this week, and has scheduled a public launch for the coin on Feb 20th.

A search of the WHOIS domain record-keeping database revealed that Younts is the current owner of BitcoinWallets.com, and that Charfen is the current owner of BitcoinWallet.com.  Who is Alex Charfen?  Founder of the Charfen Institute with his wife Cadey Charfen, Alex Charfen is an established entrepreneur and published author having written books as well as opinion articles for high-profile publications.  Also an accomplished motivational speaker, Charfen has built his career on his personal comeback story. In the 1990s, Charfen worked as at a multinational conglomerate, but lost everything when his investments in real estate were wiped out by the recession and subsequent financial collapse.  Undeterred, Charfen filed for bankruptcy and soon decided he could help the real estate industry learn from the mistakes it made. Charfen launched the Distressed Property Institute as a way to offer REALTORS additional education, and soon started the Charfen Institute, which provides training and educational products.  The company now earns 10.8m annually and placed among the Inc. 5000 in 2013.  Plans for BitcoinWallet.com?  At press time, Charfen had not responded to requests for comment about his plans for the website. However, should the entrepreneur decide to launch a bitcoin wallet service, he is likely to find competition from the available desktop, mobile and web wallets.  Existing bitcoin wallet providers such as Blockchain, which recently passed 1 million users, and Coinbase, which raised $25m in its last round of funding, have already established themselves as dominant names in the space.  However, as the bitcoin market continues to grow, it's not out of the question that the need for more user-friendly wallets, or even specialty types of wallets will emerge, meaning the investment could pay dividends.

42425396,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwTTh,1391651832,Apple Removes Blockchain Bitcoin Wallet Apps from its App Stores,"Apple has removed the Blockchain wallet app from its iOS App Stores, leaving iPhone and iPad users with no native bitcoin wallet options for their devices.  Apple offered no explanation for the action and no option to appeal, other than saying the removal was due to ""an unresolved issue"".  The Cupertino company's move did not come as a complete surprise, as Apple had previously banned bitcoin wallet apps Coinbase and CoinJar, and insisted encrypted messaging app Gliph remove an option that allowed users to send bitcoin. CoinJar is still available for download on the local Australian App Store.  Blockchain  had been available on the iOS App Store for over two years, and had been downloaded more than 120,000 times. Its native app for desktops was also removed from the Mac App store, though the slightly more open nature of OS X means users may still download and install this version from non-Apple sources.  Backlash  Blockchain  was scathing in its criticism of Apple's decision, posting the following statement on its blog:    ""These actions by Apple once again demonstrate the anti­-competitive and capricious nature of the App Store policies that are clearly focused on preserving Apple’s monopoly on payments rather than based on any consideration of the needs and desires of their users.""      ""[The app] had no customer complaints, and a broad user base. The only thing that has changed is that bitcoin has become competitive to Apple’s own payment system. By removing the Blockchain app, the only bitcoin wallet application on the App store, Apple has eliminated competition using their monopolistic position in the market in a heavy handed manner.""    After its removal of bitcoin wallet apps from its App Stores for often vague reasons, others have also questioned whether Apple might be trying to enter the mobile payment space itself, where bitcoin wallet apps would become its competition.  Even Coinbase, one of the most popular bitcoin payment processors in the US, had its iOS app blacklisted just three weeks after it launched.  Users who previously downloaded bitcoin wallet apps may continue to use them, though updates are not possible and a device reset would see the apps gone forever.  Blockchain.info  The company and team behind the Blockchain app, also called Blockchain, was a one-man operation started by British developer Ben Reeves until the summer of 2013 when the team expanded to accommodate bitcoin's popularity boom. Reeves built the site Blockchain.info initially as an academic research tool to explore bitcoin's public ledger and the secrets it divulged about the curious workings of the bitcoin economy. Since then it has become the most regularly referenced site for anyone examining strange transactions, alleged crime, mistakes, and other obscure anomalies.  Sometimes called ""The Google of bitcoin"", Blockchain's team now consists of 14 people spread around the world on at least three different continents. Its wallet service also grew from humble beginnings as a side project into the world's most popular 'web-assisted' bitcoin storage option, going from 500,000 accounts at the beginning of November 2013 to over a million by the end of the year. The company intends to spin the wallet side of things into a separate commercial entity called Blockchain.com.  After Coinbase's own iOS App Store demise, Blockchain was the only native bitcoin wallet app available to Apple mobile device users. Launched in April 2012, its initial submission was rejected by Apple but the app was allowed into the store after some UI/UX tweaks. Its interface was thus more limited compared to its Android counterpart, but it was stable and had not been updated for iOS7 possibly due to fears that updates would need to be scrutinized again by Apple's approval team and risk a ban. In the end, it seems, Apple decided not to wait.  Bitcoiners abandoning Apple?  Apple's move could see a greater exodus of its bitcoin-using fans away from iOS and towards Google's Android platform, which has several wallet options that continue to be developed and updated to meet bitcoin's increasing popularity.  Kyle Drake, lead developer at Coinpunk.com, is working on a mobile app to run in a browser, eliminating Apple's ability to block it via an App Store ban. Upon hearing the news of Blockchain's fate he issued his own call to action:  “Bitcoin users, we need your help. We need you to take a stand against Apple, make noise, complain and show Apple that there will be consequences to their actions.”  Blockchain's statement continued to question whether Apple was any longer on the side of the rebels and innovators it once claimed as its base.    ""The decision attacks a nascent and innovative technology that is empowering more than 2.5 million users on a vast variety of computing devices, around the world by giving them unfettered and complete control over their money, while disrupting centralized payment systems controlled by corporate behemoths.""      ""Unlike Apple, Google has accepted hundreds of bitcoin-­related applications even though they also compete against the company’s own payment system 'Google Wallet'.""    ""Bitcoin is a revolutionary new peer-­to-­peer currency and payment system that is empowering millions around the world, especially the unbanked and underbanked who can use it to gain access to international banking facilities with nothing more than a smartphone.""    ""Bitcoin’s use for international payments from family members sending money home to support entire communities in the developing world and for charity fundraising and fund distribution will be severely affected by this decision. As of Wednesday, bitcoin is no longer available to those using iOS devices, once again leaving them to the mercy of oppressive currency controls and governments in some of the worst regimes in the world.""    There is also an active petition on Change.org to allow bitcoin wallets to run natively on iOS devices, though whether it would elicit any official response from the notoriously silent Apple is doubtful.
