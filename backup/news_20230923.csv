This has raised speculations about the reason for this decision and what it means for the Ethereum futures ETFs projected to launch in October. Why Bitwise Withdrew Its Application Reporting this development on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Bloomberg Analyst James Seyffart stated that the asset manager has chosen to maintain only its Bitcoin exposure following this move. Related Reading: Major Milestones Shows XRP Ledger Is Becoming A DeFi Force To Be Reckoned With Many were more concerned about the reason for this decision. To clarify, Seyffart stated that the Asset manager may have made this decision simply because it doesn’t see the “benefit in having a dual BTC and ETH ETF,” especially considering that their Ethereum futures ETF is expected to launch only a few days after the first one launches. Seyffart also believes the firm’s Optimum Roll ETF investors may have preferred only exposure to Bitcoin rather than Bitcoin and Ethereum, which prompted the decision. This development comes after Bitwise had withdrawn its application for its Bitwise Bitcoin and Ether Market Cap Weight Strategy ETF, which it filed with the SEC on August 3. The asset manager had made its decision known in a filing to the SEC dated August 31. Meanwhile, the filing with the SEC to withdraw its Bitwise Bitcoin and Ether Equal Weight Strategy ETF application is dated September 22. ETH price struggling to reclaim $1,600 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com What Now For Bitwise And Ethereum Futures ETF It is worth mentioning that Bitwise isn’t backing out of the Ethereum futures ETF race despite these recent developments. The asset manager still has its Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF application with the SEC, with the fund seeking to invest in Ethereum futures contracts. The withdrawals have also not affected Seyffart’s optimism about the launch of several Ethereum futures ETFs in October as he believes there isn’t much meaning to read into the asset manager’s actions than it being “some sort of product decision.” Related Reading: Investment Firm Founder Has An Important Message For Bitcoin Holders He noted that the only time there may be reason for concern is if Valkyrie were to withdraw its application. Like Bitwise, Valkyrie had also applied to the SEC to transform its Bitcoin futures ETF (Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF) into a fund that invests in both Bitcoin and Ethereum futures contracts. Barring any denial by the SEC, asset managers like Volatility Shares, VanEck, ProShares, Roundhill, and even Bitwise are expected to launch their Ethereum futures ETF in October. Based on their respective filing dates, Volatility Shares is set to gain a first-mover advantage, launching on October 12, while others are expected to launch after.

This symmetrical triangle pattern has exerted significant influence over XRP’s price movements for the past month, indicating that it may continue to dictate the coin’s fate in the near future. The symmetrical triangle pattern is a technical analysis chart pattern characterized by converging trendlines, with one representing the coin’s lower highs and the other symbolizing its higher lows. Related Reading: ImmutableX Makes Noise As IMX Dominates Top 50 Roster With 33% Climb This pattern suggests a period of consolidation and uncertainty in the market, as traders weigh the potential for a breakout in either direction. A Crucial Breakout Looms For XRP Analysts suggest that a breakout from either side of the symmetrical triangle pattern could set the stage for a significant directional rally in XRP. Should the coin break above the upper trendline, it could potentially surge to a price of $0.55. As of now, XRP is trading at $0.512876, according to CoinGecko. Over the past 24 hours, it has recorded a modest increase of 1%, while its seven-day performance shows a 2.5% increase. Triangle Resistance Continues To Hold The report notes that the recent pullback in XRP marks the third instance where the price has retraced from the triangle’s upper trendline, underscoring the pattern’s dominance over this asset. Daily charts further emphasize this bearish sentiment, revealing an “Evening Star” pattern at the resistance, often seen as a precursor to potential downtrends. If sellers continue to dominate the market, XRP’s price may decline by approximately 6%, potentially pushing it down to the $0.485 level, which would serve as a retest of the triangle’s lower boundary. As long as XRP oscillates within these trendlines, its price is likely to remain range-bound. XRP market cap currently at $27.2 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Awaiting Exciting Developments Meanwhile, the XRP community is eagerly anticipating several exciting developments, including the launch of the Xahau network and the associated Evernode airdrop. The Xahau Ledger, which serves as the proposed Hooks sidechain and smart contract sidechain for the XRPL ecosystem, plays a crucial role in these innovations. In a recent tweet, Evernode, the Layer-2 blockchain behind these innovations, announced that its new website is now live. To safeguard its users against Twitter scammers, Evernode has implemented strict protective measures. New Website: https://t.co/YuFpmwCGbA To mitigate Twitter’s scammers, we’ll: 1.

17979291,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=552649,1695484842,Why This Bank CEO Wants 99% Of The Crypto Industry Gone,"In a bold and contentious statement, Caitlin Long has asserted that 99% of the crypto industry should be eliminated to decrease leverage buildup and improve the industry’s future advancement. Industry Overhaul Demanded For Sustainability Caitlin Long, Founder and CEO of Custodia Bank, a crypto asset banking company, has called for a seismic change in the crypto industry and its practices. The CEO emphatically suggested that only 1% of the crypto industry should be allowed to operate while 99% of the industry should be destroyed and the majority of crypto firms in the industry “flushed out.” Related Reading: How An ‘Inconsequential’ Mistake Saw Bitcoin Crash To $8,000 In a heated interview with Bezinga, Long was adamant about her controversial views of the crypto industry, stating that the industry had enormous potential but was being set back significantly by crypto firms operating using highly leveraged trading activities. Long stated that she had an active discussion with a distinguished individual who shared her views and supported the notion that the majority of the industry needs to be purged for it to thrive. “I had a debate with a prominent person. I said, ‘Look, 90% of this industry still needs to go away, and he said it’s 99%, and I think that’s right. I mean whether it’s 90% or 99%, you see the point, there’s still a bunch of crap that needs to be flushed out,” Long said. Total market cap still holding above $1.03 trillion | Source: Crypto Total Market Cap on Tradingview.com Long Compares Crypto Industry To 1999 Tech Stock Bubble Caitlin Long has likened the current crypto industry to the tech stock bubble in 1999. Notably, the tech stock bubble which coincided with the growth of internet adoption, rose 800% in investments, attracting investors from prominent companies all over the world. After reaching its peak, the stock market crashed by 740%, leaving the majority of investors and companies bankrupt and shut down. Long compares this stock market crash to the crypto market crash in 2022 which saw Bitcoin falling by about 70% and major altcoins by 80% to 90%, resulting in the bankruptcy of major firms and investors. She also stated that the crypto industry would not succeed if it continues to amplify trading activities through leverage while allowing unregulated exchanges to operate. “It is in some ways a repeat of the tech stock bubble of 1999, just so much crap. And it will not succeed, and it needs to be flushed, but markets are flushing it,” Long stated. Related Reading: Bankrupt FTX Exchange Turns Its Attention To Employees, Here’s How Much It Wants Long suggested that a lack of proper regulations on crypto exchanges is exacerbating the risks and challenges in the crypto space. Additionally, she revealed that she was in support of the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) recent crackdown on crypto exchanges in the industry. Nevertheless, the CEO has not proposed a total annihilation of the crypto industry, just a major portion of it. When asked about her views on the Bitcoin cryptocurrency, Long stated, “I don’t really care about the price. It is the least interesting aspect of this technology. I’m more interested in it as a technology.” Featured image from CNBC, chart from Tradingview.com",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/crypto/bank-ceo-99-crypto/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

However, over the last two days, Bitcoin has witnessed a slight price decline of 2%. As the most-priced blockchain asset now hovers around $26,500, crypto analyst Captain Faibik has predicted an incoming bullish run, which may see BTC close out 2023 with impressive gains. Related Reading: Coinbase Holds $25 Billion Worth Of Bitcoin, Becomes Largest Holder With 1M BTC Analyst Says Bitcoin Is Poised For 30% Gain Soon On Saturday, Captain Faibik shared on X (formerly Twitter) with his 65,000 followers a Bitcoin price forecast. Using data from Tradingview, the analyst stated that Bitcoin is currently experiencing a consolidation in a falling wedge stretching as far back as March 2023. According to Faibik, the asset is also likely to remain in this wedge all through October, reaching as low as $23,000. Upon testing this price level, Faibik predicts Bitcoin could experience a price breakout and embark on a strong bullish run. To explain, a falling wedge pattern is generally interpreted as a bullish signal. It usually suggests that a bearish trend is losing momentum, and a price reversal could soon occur. If this pattern holds true in the present Bitcoin market, Captain Faibik predicts Bitcoin could start rising in November, attaining a price of $34,500 in January 2024. Such price gain would mark a 30% increase in Bitcoin’s current price. As usual, there are no guarantees no this prediction as the crypto market is subject to various factors. Investors are advised to conduct proper personal research before making investment decisions.

SEC Appeal Incoming? The SEC is expected to decide whether or not to appeal the ruling in its case against asset manager Grayscale, with the deadline for an appeal being October 13 (45 days from the court’s ruling). On August 29, Grayscale secured a landmark victory against the SEC as the District of Columbia Court of Appeals ruled that the regulator failed to provide a valid reason for denying Grayscale’s application and ordered that the SEC review the application once again. Related Reading: Polkadot Cross-Chain Bid Takes Flight As DOT Battles Uncertainty Following the decision, a spokesperson for the agency stated that they would review the decision before determining their next steps. If the SEC chooses to appeal, it can do so at the US Supreme Court by filing a petition for a “writ of certiorari,” which is a document asking the Supreme Court to review the case, or it can ask for an “en banc” review where all the judges of the DC Court of Appeals will further review the case. An appeal by the SEC will undoubtedly dampen the mood in the crypto community as it could prolong the wait for a Spot Bitcoin ETF. However, suppose the Commission chooses not to appeal, it will become law that the spot and futures market are correlated, and the SEC’s argument that the spot market is more susceptible to fraud and manipulation will no longer stick. Cryptocurrency market cap currently at $1.03 trillion. Chart: TradingView.com Pending ETF Applications The second deadline for several pending spot Bitcoin ETF applications is in October. The SEC must decide (approve, deny, or delay) on these applications. Some notable dates include October 16 and 17. The former is the second deadline for a decision on the Bitwise Bitcoin ETP Trust. Meanwhile, October 17 is the second deadline for the SEC to decide on the iShares Bitcoin Fund, VanEck Bitcoin Trust, Wisdomtree Bitcoin Trust, Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF, and Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust. It is expected that the SEC will again choose to delay its decision on these applications, with the next deadline for a decision coming next year. Related Reading: ImmutableX Makes Noise As IMX Dominates Top 50 Roster With 33% Climb If the SEC continues to stretch its decision on these applications, the earliest a final response can come is on January 10, 2024, the final deadline for the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF. There should, however, be some positives to take from October as the SEC is expected to allow the launch of the pending Ethereum futures ETF applications, with Volatility Shares projected to launch theirs on October 12 and others coming subsequently.

The general market condition has not offered much reprieve either, as most altcoins have failed to maintain an upward momentum. Fortunately, the latest on-chain revelation offers some hope for the price of Ethereum. Ethereum Average Fee Drops To Lowest Level In 2023 On-chain analytics have been helpful in providing real-time insights into crypto market trends. And the latest on-chain revelations have highlighted a plunge in Ethereum network fees, which might prove to be a turning point for the cryptocurrency’s market value and performance. According to the on-chain analytics platform, Santiment, the Ethereum network fees have dropped to their lowest levels in 2023, with each transaction averaging about $1.15 as of this writing. This reflects a significant fall from the huge fees seen in 2021 and 2022, with demand for processing power causing the average fees to reach above $50. Related Reading: Ethereum Bearish Signal Reappears After Five Years To Threaten ETH’s Price Historically, such a decline in fees is a positive sign for Ethereum’s utility and adoption, as lower costs make it more profitable and worthwhile to use the network. Santiment also noted that rising utility is often the case due to Ether tokens becoming more affordable to circulate. It is worth noting that the impact of this development can spread to the overall market value of the digital asset. Increased utility and adoption can contribute to the recovery of Ethereum’s market capitalization and value. The Effect On ETH Price? Indeed, the plunging network fees positively benefit Ethereum and its users, especially as it can improve other network metrics and parameters. However, this development has not significantly impacted ETH price, as it seems to be struggling to break out from under the current selling pressure. On Thursday, September 21, the cryptocurrency fell beneath the psychological $1,600 level for the second time this month. And the Ether token continues to trade below this price mark, with a roughly 2.6% decline in the past three days. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Plunges After Rejection, Are Bears Back In Action? Investors will be watching to see if Ethereum can build positive network momentum while fees are low. However, it remains to be seen whether this will be enough to propel the ETH price out of consolidation, especially as there are no signs of buying pressure from Ethereum whales. Moreover, the dwindling number of major ETH holders adds zero optimism to this scenario. This is because such a decline in whale holdings can make the Ethereum price increasingly susceptible to downward pressure. According to CoinGecko data, the Ether token trades for $1,593, reflecting a 2.6% price dip in the past week. Ethereum is currently the second-largest cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization of $191.6 billion.

Chart: TradingView.com On-chain data cited in a report suggests a glimmer of hope, indicating a slight improvement in DOT’s weighted sentiment over the last three weeks. This uptick in confidence among traders suggests that some believe in DOT’s potential for an eventual upswing, though it has yet to manifest in price action.

Ray III, is intensifying efforts just weeks before FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried faces trial in what has been labeled one of the largest financial frauds in American history. Bankruptcy court proceedings kicked off the week as FTX filed a lawsuit against Bankman-Fried’s parents, Allan Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried. The suit aims to reclaim millions of dollars allegedly fraudulently transferred and misappropriated by the couple, who purportedly took advantage of their access and influence within FTX to enrich themselves at the expense of debtors and creditors. Continuing the pursuit of recovery, FTX Trading Ltd. subsequently filed a lawsuit on Thursday against four former employees of Alameda Ltd., an FTX affiliate based in Hong Kong. The complaint alleges that these employees received $153 million in transfers shortly before the collapse of the crypto trading platform. According to Bloomberg, these individuals allegedly leveraged personal connections to prioritize the withdrawal of their funds and digital assets from FTX once it became evident that the company was facing financial turmoil. FTX CEO Ramps Up Efforts To Reclaim Assets Per Bloomberg’s report, the bankruptcy proceedings have attracted the attention of outside investors and speculators, including prominent distressed-debt investors like Silver Point Capital, Diameter Capital Partners, and Attestor Capital. These entities have seized the opportunity to acquire discounted FTX claims, anticipating that the protracted bankruptcy process will uncover additional valuable assets.

Court records show that they have already purchased over $250 million worth of FTX debts since the beginning of the year, according to a Bloomberg analysis. While legal actions are in progress, some funds are being voluntarily returned. Stanford University, where Bankman and Fried held teaching positions and enjoyed reputations as legal scholars, announced its decision to return millions of dollars received from FTX and its associated entities. According to court documents, Stanford received gifts totaling approximately $5.5 million from FTX-related entities between November 2021 and May 2022. Bankman-Fried Family Turns To Risky Strategy According to a Fortune Magazine report, The Bankman-Fried family has adopted a risky strategy in their legal battle, shifting blame onto prominent law firm Sullivan & Cromwell. They argue that the firm failed to act in its best interests, downplaying its involvement in FTX’s downfall. This move aims to establish an “advice of counsel” defense, painting Sam Bankman-Fried as a well-meaning individual who received “poor legal advice”. Criticism of Sullivan & Cromwell’s substantial legal fees, exceeding $100 million in the FTX bankruptcy case, raises ethical concerns but not necessarily legal wrongdoing. Per the report, the family’s strategy may backfire, as it could provide prosecutors with access to new evidence by waiving attorney-client privilege. Furthermore, the defense’s focus on blaming the law firm invites scrutiny of Bankman-Fried’s father, an active participant in key business decisions. Additionally, Bankman-Fried’s father received $10 million in FTX funds that he has yet to return, potentially for his son’s legal defense. Related Reading: Privacy For All: Brave To Integrate Zcash Protocol On Native Crypto Wallet The Bankman-Fried family’s attempt to discredit Sullivan & Cromwell introduces complexity to the case.

Trackers reveal that CRV is up 22% in the past two weeks, adding 10% in the last week alone. Coincidentally, there has been increased activity from a whale moving CRV from Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by client count. Whale Offloads CRV From Binance To Curve Finance According to The Data Nerd, a tracker, a whale transferred 1.542 million CRV, worth roughly $684,000, from Binance. Afterward, the whale, only identified as “0x171,” added liquidity to Curve Finance. Over the last week, the whale has been actively supplying liquidity to Curve Finance, providing 5.36 million CRV worth $2.27 million. CRV is the governance token in CurveDAO, the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) behind Curve Finance. Since the exchange is decentralized, CRV holders have voting rights. Moreover, they can receive rewards whenever they supply liquidity to any of Curve Finance’s pools. Related Reading: Bankrupt FTX Exchange Turns Its Attention To Employees, Here’s How Much It Wants Curve Finance used an automated market maker (AMM) model for the trustless swapping of stablecoins, including DAI, USDT, USDC, and other tokens like ETH and wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC). However, to function optimally, Curve Finance relies on liquidity pools where users can supply liquidity and get a share of fees distributed in CRV. The withdrawal of coins from Binance to a non-custodial wallet is a vote of confidence for CRV. The token has been free-falling in Q3 2023. To illustrate, CRV crashed by 32% in August alone. The draw-down was worsened by the broader contraction in crypto occasioned by waning momentum around the approval of several complex derivatives for Bitcoin and Ethereum. At the same time, regulatory actions, especially from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), significantly impacted sentiment and token prices. CRV Sold Off After Hack The free-fall of CRV can be directly pinned to an exploit of multiple Curve Finance liquidity pools in late July 2023. In a re-entrancy attack, a hacker exploited a vulnerability in the older version of a Vyper compiler, draining over $61 million worth of tokens from Curve Finance’s pools. Through the re-entrancy attack, the hacker could infinitely withdraw deposited tokens from Curve Finance’s pools, resulting in losses. Related Reading: How An ‘Inconsequential’ Mistake Saw Bitcoin Crash To $8,000 Curve Finance has since patched the vulnerability, but CRV prices are yet to recover despite the recent pump. Also, its co-founder and CEO, Michael Egorov, had to liquidate a big chunk of CRV that he had used to secure loans on multiple platforms, including Aave. By early August, Egorov had sold 106 million CRV via over-the-counter (OTC) trades at a discount to multiple entities. Top buyers included Justin Sun, the co-founder of Tron, who bought 2 million CRV, and Jeffrey Huang, who acquired 3.75 million CRV.
