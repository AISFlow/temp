42426559,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJtZPh,1444772560,Bitcoin Firm Signs Compliance Deal With Banking Giant Barclays,"UK banking giant Barclays signed contracts with eight graduates of its New York-based FinTech accelerator program today, two of which will partner with the company on applications using blockchain technology.  Co-hosted by TechStars, the 11 startups graduating the 13-week program included bitcoin compliance firm Chainalysis and accounting startup Wave, which will embark on the initiatives.  Speaking to New York Business Journal, Barclays chief design and innovation officer Derek White called the deals with Chainalysis and Wave a ""game-changer"" for the bank.  Barclays indicated it would partner with Chainalysis to allow its financial crime and transaction monitoring teams to obtain the necessary information to transact with bitcoin companies.  Chainalysis co-founder Jonathan Levin said this would position Barclays as one of the first mainstream financial institutions to provide services to bitcoin firms, many of whom struggle with access to basic banking.  Levin told CoinDesk:  ""This is the first time a top-tier bank has integrated a compliance solution that would enable them to bank bitcoin and blockchain companies.""  Wave, in turn, is working with Barclays' Corporate Bank on a project that finds it using its solution for titles during shipping processes.  As part of the program, Barclays provides non-monetary support to startups, while startup incubator TechStars takes 6% equity in each member of its cohort.  The announcement follows the news that Barclays would collaborate on a bitcoin proof of concept with bitcoin services provider Safello, a graduate of its London-based accelerator. The trial was later revealed as a means to help charities accept bitcoin as a form of payment.

42426568,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJtZfh,1444770451,Qiwi: Bitcoin Technology is 'Beyond' Russia's Proposed Ban,"New details have emerged about Russian payments giant Qiwi's plans to issue its own cryptocurrency.  Russian-language bitcoin news site ForkLog spoke with Qiwi communications director Konstantin Koltsov and Alexei Arkhipov, who is overseeing the project, about the ""bitruble"", which made waves in Russian media circles last month after the firm announced its intentions.  Russian government officials like financial ombudsman Pavel Medvedev later denounced the plan, but the company has moved ahead, filing for relevant trademarks and floating the notion of backing the currency with commodities.  Koltsov and Arkhipov defended Qiwi's cryptocurrency initiative in the interview, noting that different market players have differing opinions on the plan. They went on to suggest that Qiwi believes the project has the potential to cut costs and improve operations within the payment processor.  The representatives told ForkLog:  ""We think that cryptotechnology is beyond any prohibition. Qiwi is a major processor, and load operation has always been a pressing challenge for us. We’d be happy to reduce costs for [our] back-office – that’s where our development actually originates. We are interested in anything that could reduce costs and expenses related to end-user services.""  The two disclosed that Qiwi has been ""researching cryptotechnologies for like a year, maybe a bit more"", spending roughly six months on the cryptocurrency initiative from inception to its announcement.  According to the company, the cryptocurrency could be launched as early as next year, but that its decision will ultimately depend on whether Russia moves ahead with a proposed ban on money substitutes, a prohibition that would cover digital currencies.  ""Certainly, we are ready to release the project in 2016, but we have to wait for the Central Bank’s reaction; its opinion and vision as to when and how it has to happen is important,"" the two said in the interview.  The Qiwi reps declined to get into specifics about the make-up of its cryptocurrency project, stating:  ""We’d like to keep it under wraps for a while. Our company is amongst the market’s major players, and we are not willing to build up an artificial interest to our designs.""  Read the full interview here.

42426566,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJtZZh,1444755730,Ripple Sues Social App for $2 Million Over Trademark Infringement,"Ripple (formerly Ripple Labs) has filed a trademark infringement lawsuit against Kefi Labs, the makers of a social photo-sharing app called Ripple.  In documents filed on 2nd October in the US District Court for the Northern District of California, the San Francisco startup stated it is seeking $2m in damages against Kefi Labs for infringement, unfair competition and cybersquatting, funds it suggests represent three times of the value of the actual damages sustained.  The 13-page lawsuit goes on to allege Kefi Labs and its employees used domain names such as getripple.io that were ""confusingly similar"" to Ripple, and were thus likely to cause consumer confusion. Ripple argues it is owed $100,000 in statutory damages per domain name.  Attorney Lawrence Gordon, of Feldman Gale PA, wrote on behalf of Ripple:  ""Defendants are harming consumers and irreparably damaging goodwill associated with Ripple Labs' Ripple trademarks and Ripple Labs.""  As a result, Ripple is seeking to acquire the rights to Kefi Labs' current domain name; encourage the company to abandon a trademark filing for 'Ripple'; and have it ordered to ""destroy"" all offending products and marketing material.  A video submitted to YouTube, indicates that Kefi Labs founders had applied for the Y Combinator startup accelerator in San Francisco. At press time, the app had a two-star rating on the iTunes app store.  Ripple has asked its terms be satisfied by Kefi Labs within 30 days of the filing, and that it receive a ""verified report"" that its terms have been carried out. If not, the filing asserts Ripple is prepared to take the case to a jury trial.  Neither representatives from Kefi Labs or Ripple immediately responded to requests for comment.

42426571,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJtZjh,1444742333,European Bitcoin Exchange Yacuna Announces Closure,"European cryptocurrency exchange Yacuna has announced it will close next month.  The firm shared the news with customers via email this afternoon, asking them to withdraw any remaining funds before 15th November.  Its email – from support@yacuna.com – read:  ""Bitcoin is a wonderful technology and we are proud, that we have developed one of the first European exchanges for virtual currency. But everything comes to an end.""  The company said it will manually batch and process customer withdrawals. ""Please understand that this process may take some time until completed,"" it added.  About Yacuna  The UK-based exchange, founded by ClickandBuy veteran Andrei Martchouk, offered bitcoin, litecoin, ultracoin and dogecoin trading for users across Europe.  It had waived all trading and withdrawal fees in February – framing the move as a bid to boost the ecosystem.  Executive director and chief compliance officer Mark Caruso told CoinDesk:  ""We offered the service for free since we believe in the disruptive potential of blockchain technology. However, the lack of significant volume and a growth rate that remained below expectations led to the decision of shutting down the service.""  While the company has been quiet on social media of late, its email hints the team may move on to other projects in the bitcoin space:  ""We hope that you will continue to be an integral part of the bitcoin community and support us in our future projects,"" it reads.  Trading volume  European marketplaces such as Yacuna and CoinFloor face stiff competition from well-funded rivals in China and the US – who are now seeking to expand in the region.  Coinbase has rolled out its service to 28 countries across Europe, adding an 'instant buy' feature for all but two earlier this month.  Circle – backed to the tune of $76m – has also announced its intention to open a UK base for a European roll out.  Additionally, GBP and EUR trades are still dwarfed by those in CNY. According to data from Bitcoinity, yesterday the currency accounted for 84% of all daily trading volume, while trades in GBP and EUR came to less than 3%.

Latin American e-tailer Famsa is now accepting bitcoin for online purchases.  The chain, founded in 1970, sells a variety of consumer goods and electronics across Mexico and the US. It is processing transactions via Atlanta firm BitPay.  The news follows last month's announcement from MercadoLibre – the 'eBay of Latin America' – that it would integrate bitcoin, and a deal between Mexico's BitPagos and Entrepids to allow e-commerce stores to accept the currency.  Alberto Vega, BitPay's regional manager for Latin America, told CoinDesk interest among online retailers is growing:  ""It is a very exciting time for bitcoin adoption in Latin America. We are experiencing a great moment, [with] major growth since the TAR Airlines announcement a few months ago.""  Although bitcoin merchant adoption is waning – with many businesses reporting ""widely disappointing"" sales – Latin America appears to be bucking the trend.  According to BitPay, the region saw a 510% increase in transactions from 2014 to 2015. It sees around 10% of transactions happening in Europe, the region that hosts half of BitPay's merchants.

42426574,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJtZnh,1444719681,Blockstream to Launch First Sidechain for Bitcoin Exchanges,"Nearly one year after the release of its sidechains white paper, bitcoin technology startup Blockstream has announced the first commercial application of the technology.    Dubbed Liquid, the unlaunched offering will serve bitcoin exchanges, payment processors and traders by reducing the time in which bitcoin-denominated funds can be transferred between accounts at these institutions.  Five major bitcoin startups – Bitfinex, BTCC, Kraken, Unocoin and Xapo – will operate the private sidechain, allowing partner exchanges to move funds between order books without the need to transfer funds on the bitcoin blockchain.  Blockstream  CEO Austin Hill explained:  ""The capital requirement of maintaining balances at all these exchanges is high for today's traders. [They say] 60–70% of the trades they could make, they can't take advantage of because of the settlement lag.""  Hill contends that Liquid will reduce the time it takes funds to move between exchanges from 60 minutes to seconds.  ""That in of itself is the simplest use case,"" he added.  The startups involved will participate in the operation of the sidechain, but at the same time will be customers of Blockstream, paying an undisclosed monthly subscription fee. Hill suggested that the effort is the first of what could be many commercial sidechains offerings, both from Blockstream and users of its open-source software.  Blockstream suggested Liquid is set to launch in Q1 of 2016.  First announced in April 2014, sidechains were hailed as a radical concept for boosting the functionality of bitcoin by allowing assets to move from the main bitcoin blockchain to an alternative blockchain and back through a system of two-way pegging.  Once on an alternative blockchain, the assets can effectively be governed by a different set of rules, while still maintaining their ability to be transferred back to the bitcoin blockchain at a later date, and thus redeemed via the existing bitcoin market infrastructure.  Blockstream has to date raised $21m from investors including AME Cloud Ventures, Blockchain Capital, Future\Perfect Ventures and LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman. Further, its team consists of some of the more noted developers in the space including Adam Back, Gregory Maxwell, Matt Corallo and Pieter Wuille.  Liquid in practice  On a technical level, Liquid will find partner exchanges transferring funds to a shared multi-signature wallet address, with a Byzantine round robin consensus protocol used to process transactions.  To ensure that no parties are able to block transactions, Hill explained that rules have been put in place to shield data about the transactions from network participants.  ""As long as the transaction is constructed and the private key is correct and the unspent transaction output is valid, then all of the signers who are running nodes approve the transaction,"" Hill said.  While all parties in the Liquid sidechain are known and identified, Hill sought to highlight the difference between sidechains and private blockchain approaches.  ""Liquid does have many of the same properties, but these exchanges are running a parallel blockchain [to the main bitcoin blockchain]. We can implement all the business logic at a protocol layer, so other party has custodianship of these funds. Other attempts are centralized, we don't have that issue,"" he continued.  Hill said Liquid will integrate Confidential Transactions, meaning that exchanges can process the same transaction data without the risk that information – such as trading volumes – will be revealed in the process.  The privacy protocol was introduced in the release of Sidechains Elements, a set of initial tools for developers, earlier this year.  Business need  Technology aside, Hill spoke to the everyday business challenges he believes Liquid will help the bitcoin ecosystem address, emphasizing the benefits it could bring to exchanges and traders.  ""I think it's showing a maturing of the ecosystem, licensed exchanges are expanding their pool of customers. They now have more demands on the functionality they offer,"" he said.  Hill went on to explain how previously difficult tasks, like fulfilling contractual obligations to execute orders for family offices or institutions at the best market prices, were impractical within the current exchange system. With Liquid, he said, exchanges could now take advantage of sourcing bitcoins on a competitor's order book, a process he said positions the ecosystem to move closer to traditional derivatives and stock markets.  In statements, other members of Liquid echoed these remarks.  Zane Tackett, director of product development at Bitfinex, noted that the ability to move funds between exchanges in seconds would make arbitrage opportunities more accessible to the trading community.
