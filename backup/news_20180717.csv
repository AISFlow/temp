42401646,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd1yMT,1531864847,Civic Is Turning Identity.com Into a Crypto-Powered Personal Data Market,"""I never thought we'd get it.""  That's Vinny Lingham, co-founder and CEO of the blockchain identity startup Civic, talking about the company's acquisition of ""Identity.com"" – a fitting web domain for a company built around the idea of putting personally identifiable data in the control of its owners.  To that point, Lingham said he had always thought Identity.com would be an ideal address from which to promote the platform he is building.  Civic raised $33 million in a token sale last year as part of an effort build a decentralized infrastructure for third parties to make attestations about individuals.  Even with those resources, the domain was valuable internet real estate. It was previously controlled by a company named Inflection, which dates back to 2006, according to Crunchbase.  At first, the domain seemed out of reach, given that it was controlled by an established business. But all that changed when Civic learned that the firm had made the decision to call it quits on that line of business.  ""It was very opportunistic and we lucked out for sure,"" Lingham said.  As a condition of the sale, Lingham couldn't reveal any more about the negotiations or the amount Civic paid to acquire the address – Civic's tokens currently have a market capitalization of $65.9 million according to CoinMarketCap – but, as he put it:  ""It wasn't pocket change.""  Consumer-led identity  At its heart, the Civic protocol is built around the idea that users control their own data: – ""your information sits on your device, not on our servers,"" as Lingham explains it.  Identity.com will serve as a hub for businesses that have information and those that need it. So, rather than one company selling data about its users directly to another firm, the first company that can verify data would share that attestation with the user, who would then share it with the second firm that needs the information.  The blockchain allows the company receiving the information to verify that the attestation held by the consumer is legitimate.  Many different companies might be able to, for example, verify that a specific user has a valid driver's license, but other companies might have different levels of trust in each other.  So, Identity.com will be a place for companies to set up relationships and have a means to tell consumers whose attestations they will trust.  ""The key thing here is it will run on CVC tokens,"" Lingham said.  The token will be the method by which requesting companies pay for validation from companies that have the information. Smart contracts are used to protect everyone during the transaction, ensuring that validators only get paid once requesting companies have received adequate information.  Many vendors, one market  Identity.com is expected to start directing traffic to a Civic-controlled website as of 22:00 UTC.  According to Lingham, the domain will play host to a business-to-business marketplace for companies looking to sell attestations about individuals and the companies seeking to verify information about their customers.  Citing the acquisition of a domain that will give their venture a higher profile, Civic has also decided to delay the launch of this marketplace to the fourth quarter of this year instead of the third quarter, as CoinDesk previously reported.  Civic will also make the software behind the marketplace open-source by the end of this year, in keeping with the industry-wide ethos of decentralization.  ""We don't want to be the ones behind it,"" Lingham explained. ""Initially we start off being a bit more stewards, but, over the long term — hopefully, we don't need to be.""  Civic will be one of the companies in the Identity.com marketplace – but it hopes to be one of many.  ""Civic will be like Stripe for identity,"" Lingham said, meaning it will be easy for sites that want to use its network to verify people to integrate it with an easy API call.  But the new site is bigger than Civic's part of it. Lingham positioned the domain acquisition as a major step for not just his company but the development of a ""Web 3.0""  He told CoinDesk:  ""It's a big move for the industry, getting that domain secured and establish that as a rallying point.""

42422914,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0qzFh,1531863056,What to Expect When Congress Talks Crypto (Twice) Tomorrow,"It's a crypto doubleheader on Capitol Hill tomorrow.  Two U.S. House of Representatives Committees  will be hosting hearings on Wednesday to look at the topic from two distinct angles.  The House Committee on Agriculture will focus on the emergence of ""digital assets"" while the Financial Policy Subcommittee hearing will examine ""the extent to which the United States government should consider cryptocurrencies as money,"" as previously reported.  According to new information published Tuesday, the Agriculture Committee hearing will notably see former JPMorgan blockchain lead and current CEO of Clovyr Amber Baldet, former Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) chairman Gary Gensler and Andreessen Horowitz managing partner Scott Kupor, among others, testify.  ""This hearing will shed light on the promise of digital assets and the regulatory challenges facing this new asset class. Our committee has a deep interest in promoting strong markets for commodities of all types, including those emerging through new technology,"" Rep. Michael Conaway, chairman of the committee, said in a statement.  By contrast, the Financial Services hearing seems to be tackling the broader question of what cryptocurrencies are exactly. According to a memo detailing the hearing's goals, members ""will evaluate the merits of any uses by central banks of cryptocurrencies, and discuss the future of both cryptocurrencies and physical cash.""  As of press time, none of the committee members contacted by CoinDesk responded to requests for comment, leaving the question of sentiment around the topics an open one ahead of the hearings.  Yet as for what those tuning in can expect, one might want to refer to the last few times Congress tackled the subject.  Back in March, for example, a hearing on initial coin offerings – likely to emerge during the testimonies tomorrow – saw lawmakers argue for greater protections while Representative Tom Emmer called for more regulatory restraint. A hearing in May saw lawmakers discuss the ""almost limitless"" applications of the tech, to borrow a phrase from one Department of Homeland Security official.  Luckily for those hoping to follow the action, the hearings – which will be live streamed – are spaced out throughout the day. The Agriculture Committee's gathering is set for 10 a.m. EDT, with the Financial Services Committee's hearing scheduled for 2 p.m. EDT.

The deal for a 9.9 percent stake in WEG Bank AG resulted through a partnership with the crypto startup TokenPay, as previously reported. And while the response on social media seems to have been mostly positive, Lee nonetheless took to Reddit on Tuesday to offer ""clarifications"" on the nature of the deal, the foundation's involvement and what benefits the arrangement could bring.  According to Lee, that best-case scenario would see WEG Bank attempt to launch crypto products and services – but that's not a done deal by any means, the litecoin creator conceded.  He wrote  :  ""Best case is that with this bank, we are able to create and deliver crypto solutions like debit cards, merchant processing, and other innovative solutions. However, even with a stake and influence at the bank, it's not guaranteed that this will succeed.""  Lee also clarified that the deal didn't see the foundation spend any money, saying that the stake came ""in exchange for technical work and marketing support for TokenPay, eFin decentralized exchange, and integration with the bank.""  ""To be clear, LF did not pay any money for this stake in the bank. The plan is also for me to get a board seat at the bank,"" he explained.  Lee noted that there are still some obstacles to overcome in order to launch a crypto debit card, writing: ""People have brought up valid concerns that we still need to work with and be approved by players in the current financial systems like Visa and SWIFT.""

42381034,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93J9B,1531843212,Mastercard Wins Patent for Speeding Up Crypto Payments,"Mastercard won a U.S. patent on Tuesday for a method of speeding up cryptocurrency payments.  The document, published July 17 by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), explains that though cryptocurrencies have ""seen increased usage over traditional fiat currencies by consumers who value anonymity and security,"" the wide disparity in payment processing times between the two classes of assets puts cryptocurrencies at a ""disadvantage.""  ""There is a need to improve on the storage and processing of transactions that utilize blockchain currencies,"" the patent claims.  It goes on to explain:  ""It often takes a significant amount of time, around ten minutes, for a blockchain-based transaction to be processed ... Conversely, traditional fiat payment transactions that are processed using payment networks often have processing times that are measured in nanoseconds … Therefore, many entities, particularly merchants, retailers, service providers, and other purveyors of goods and services, may be wary of accepting blockchain currency for products and participating in blockchain transactions.""  To reduce these transaction times, the company would be offering a new type of user account able to transact in cryptocurrencies through existing systems for fiat currencies. This account would link a series of profiles able to identify a user's ""fiat currency amount, a blockchain currency amount, an account identifier and an address.""  The transactions themselves would use the fiat currency's payment rails and security features, but each transaction would represent a cryptocurrency.  Mastercard also adds that by processing transactions made with cryptocurrencies in this way, ""payment networks may be able to evaluate the likelihood of fraud and assess risk for blockchain transactions using existing fraud and risk algorithms and information that is available to payment networks, such as historical fiat and blockchain transaction data, credit bureau data, demographic information, etc., that is unavailable for use in blockchain networks.""  Indeed, this is not the first time Mastercard has expressed interest in addressing consumer protection in the space of crypto, having applied for a separate patent last year looking at building refund services for cryptocurrency transactions.

42381026,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93J0N,1531839614,Russian Firm Will Reward Staff With Crypto Tokens Tied to Profits,"Qiwi Blockchain Technologies (QBT), a subsidiary of the Russian e-payments firm Qiwi, plans to incentivize staff by rewarding them with a custom token.  According to a report from Russian news agency Interfax on Monday, QBT – which was launched in March to develop in-house blockchain solutions and provide consultation services around token issuance – will issue a token that is tied to the company's profit.  Konstantine Koltsov, a partner at the firm, told CoinDesk that up to 50 percent of the net profit will be allocated for the rewards program, and each token will be worth around 0.001 percent of the net profit. The program has apparently already been approved by Qiwi CEO Sergey Solonin and is expected to go live in the third or fourth quarter of this year.  To determine how the rewards tokens are divided among staff, a second token will be used to assign voting rights. Departments' heads will get different amounts of voting tokens according to their weight in the company, and will then be able to use them to decide the allocation of bonus tokens among other staff.  In the future, voting tokens will also be handed out to all employees of the firm to provide them with an opportunity to vote on management decisions and hiring and firing, for example. They will also be able to evaluate their co-workers performances via the system, rewarding better performers with more bonus tokens.  This model should be more efficient than the key performance indicator (KPI)-based evaluation models now used by many corporations, Koltsov said. While only a few dozen people work at QBT currently, that number is likely to grow to around 100 by the mid-2019, he added.  One problem facing the program in the short-term is that, due to the absence of crypto regulation in Russia, the tokens can't be cashed out into fiat currency such as rubles. However, holding them will make employees eligible for quarterly bonuses proportional to the amount of tokens owned.  The system supporting the tokens – which are based on ethereum's ERC-721 standard – is built on the Masterchain platform, according to the firm. Koltsov told CoinDesk that Masterchain had been chosen largely due to its its convenience for Russian companies, some of which are already familiar with the platform.  He added:  ""Many other public networks in this field are less predictable as they have their decision makers defining the rules of the game.""  Masterchain was developed by a group of banks and payment firms – including Qiwi – under the governance of the Central Bank of Russia and completed just over a year ago.  QBT also has plans to patent its system as a fully-fledged token management system and market it as a corporate management product.  Last month, managers from QBT founded a crypto investment bank called HASH to manage clients' ICOs and help them invest in blockchain startups.

Announced Tuesday, a startup called Stronghold is launching USD Anchor, which will run on the rails of the Stellar blockchain and use its consensus mechanism to verify transactions. The token will be backed one-for-one with U.S. dollars held at a Nevada-charted trust company called Prime Trust, which in turn will deposit the cash at banks insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.  New York City-based Signature Bank was originally expected to be providing the federally insured backing of the stable coin, but it appears to have backed out of the partnership at the eleventh hour, according to IBM.  IBM is partnering on the initiative with Stronghold, and said it will explore various use cases for the token with its financial institution clients.  ""What we really want to do is enable all sorts of digital transactional networks to settle their transactions with digital fiat currency on the same blockchain networks,"" Jesse Lund, IBM's head of blockchain services for financial institutions, told CoinDesk.  Stronghold acts as an ""anchor,"" or on- and off-ramp, to the Stellar network. The startup will issue the digital asset, which represents a claim on U.S. dollars deposited with Prime Trust and ultimately insured by the FDIC, the U.S. agency created in 1933 whose sticker on the doors of bank branches has long reassured Americans their money is safe.  ""The process for seamlessly managing and trading assets of any form from digital to traditional currencies, needs to evolve,"" said Stronghold's co-founder and CTO, Sean Bennett, in a release. ""Asset-backed tokens can provide seamless access to all currencies, improving the global movement of money.""  As such, the project represents one of several recent efforts to tokenize fiat currency in order to make transactions as fast and frictionless as crypto but without the volatility. The first use cases IBM will pursues will be around cross-border payments in the form of remittances and small-scale foreign exchange transactions.  The stablecoin is now available to institutional clients and IBM aims to ""put it to use as quickly as possible,"" Lund told CoinDesk, adding,  ""I think you will see some solutions that IBM has been backing making use of this certainly before the end of this year.""  Elephant in the room  The project bears at least a superficial resemblance to Tether, the stablecoin issuer that's been the subject of controversy due to lingering questions about its U.S. dollar reserves.  In both cases, real-world fiat is deposited with a counterparty (Tether in the case of USDT, Prime Trust for USD Anchor) and then represented by a token that zips around on the blockchain.  ""You can't talk about this without talking about Tether,"" Lund acknowledged. ""But there are certainly some differences with Tether versus what we are doing.""  The most obvious one is the FDIC coverage, and the involvement of a state-chartered trust company, which should give investors confidence that the USD Anchor is fully backed – certainly moreso than the tepid assurances Tether had provided from third-party firms.  Scott Purcell, the CEO and chief trust officer at Prime Trust, said it is fully audited (a distinction that's eluded Tether) and has relationships with such FDIC-insured institutions as U.S. Bank and Pacific Mercantile Bank.  Since the FDIC only covers deposits up to $250,000 in the event of bank failure, any deposit larger than that would be split and stored at multiple banks. ""If we're holding cash, it has to be FDIC-insured,"" Purcell said.  Prime Trust has similar arrangements with other stablecoin issuers, including TrueUSD, he said. It also does know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money-laundering (AML) checks on token holders, both when they cash in and when they cash out.  A subtler difference is that Tether's USDT token is mainly used by traders to move value in and out of cryptocurrency exchanges quickly so they can take advantage of arbitrage opportunities. In contrast, IBM envisions the Anchor being used by financial institutions for a host of more mainstream use cases, starting with payments, but moving into areas like food tracking, global trade and supply chain and so on.  ""What we are trying to do is make digital currencies more relevant for everyday types of transactions, and not just about trading cryptocurrencies,"" Lund said.  Big Blue's view  For IBM, the stablecoin is only the first step down a path could lead to multiple digital currencies.  ""What we envision is a network that has multiple different asset classes living on it. You could have digital euros, digital dollars, digital pounds – and they are all really kind of running on the same networks,"" Lund said.  This would provide practical business benefits, he argued. ""This would radically change the whole foreign exchange market because you wouldn't have to do FX in large blocks like they do now,"" Lund said. ""FX could be a real-time transaction atomic thing.""  The stablecoin project also represents an expansion of IBM's partnership with Stellar, which was first revealed in October.  Back then IBM announced it had been working with the Stellar protocol and its native token, lumens, as a bridge currency between money transfer operators in a number of South Pacific island nations. Since then IBM has been busy expanding this into a larger production ready network.  ""We haven't announced anything yet but it includes regulated financial institutions in a whole bunch of other jurisdictions,"" said Lund.  The reason IBM has (non-exclusively) partnered with Stellar is because its team has experience in cross-border payments and the protocol scales well with no mining in its consensus system, Lund said.  While IBM is most deeply invested in is Hyperledger Fabric, the last 12 months have seen much additional focus on Stellar, said Lund, concluding:  ""I envision we will continue to adopt other blockchain protocols to round out the platform as use cases require.""

42381028,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93J1d,1531824112,Banks Take Sides as Blockchain Trade Finance Race Heats Up,"Trade finance is possibly the busiest space in enterprise blockchain today. And while the people behind the different platforms may say they're not in competition, that's not how it looks from the outside.  Announced Tuesday, NatWest, a part of the Royal Bank of Scotland, has joined Marco Polo, the consortium started by enterprise blockchain startup R3 and trade finance specialist TradeIX. The addition of the U.K.'s third largest bank brings the total number of institutions in Marco Polo to 10 and follows a $16 million funding round for the consortium.  But the news also comes on the heels of the recent announcement that We.Trade, a rival trade finance blockchain platform built on Hyperledger Fabric with nine banks on board, has gone live. A spokesman for HSBC, which is working closely with We.Trade, said that the platform executed 10 transactions in the last week.  Marco Polo, meanwhile, is still in the pilot phase and is expected to enter production in the fourth quarter.  As such, the NatWest announcement points to a fault line emerging in this sector, with some banks choosing the faster-to-market but more narrowly focused We.Trade and others going with the more ambitious, but consequently more deliberative, Marco Polo.  Notably, We.Trade is a private legal entity, which has picked off a particular market segment – trade finance for small- and mid-size enterprises (SMEs) in Europe. By contrast, Marco Polo has a much grander vision for a ""universal trade network"" (UTN), but as a consortium, it can only move as fast as its members.  Still, NatWest specifically cited Marco Polo's focus on standards and interoperability with other platforms as its reason for going with the consortium.  Richard Crook, the head of emerging technology at NatWest's parent company, RBS, told CoinDesk:  ""Marco Polo has focused on creating an open standard, open to all underlying networks using R3's Corda. TradeIX is the first but will not be the only vendor to build on top of this UTN to provide client facing services through their APIs.""  NatWest joins BNP Paribas, Commerzbank, ING, Standard Chartered Bank, Natixis, Bangkok Bank, SMBC, DNB and OP Financial Group on the Marco Polo platform.  The consortium, Crook said, ""worked hard to define a decentralized open ecosystem in which all parties can openly and evenly participate.""  Avoiding silos  The argument for Marco Polo's approach to trade finance on the blockchain is that while development may take a bit longer, ensuring that the new systems can talk to each other is necessary if this technology is to fulfill its promise of removing friction from global trade.  As it stands, there is a mishmash of platforms and protocols, which some domain experts fear could perpetuate silos.  Oliver Belin, CMO at TradeIX, said that banks today must try to avoid a situation where they work with other fintech players and platforms, as well as having an application developed in-house, and while also trying to work with other banks. R3's Corda, he said, avoids the problem of multiple solutions.  ""I think many people are quite surprised that all these blockchain trade finance platforms cannot communicate between each other,"" said Belin. ""Most people – even some banks – think We.Trade can share information with other Hyperledger projects or networks, or even with Marco Polo, which is not the case at all.""  That said, Marco Polo says its technology will be seamlessly interoperable with the other main trade finance platform built using R3, known as Voltron.  Sophie Wiberg Holm, project lead at R3, said Marco Polo and Voltron complement each other nicely and are working together closely on things like standards for invoices or purchase orders and allowing for trade assets to be shared between different applications. She also said Corda-based trade platforms can interoperate with the likes of B3i, the insurance distributed ledger technology (DLT) consortium.  ""We can't do that without thinking this far ahead and many blockchain solutions today are not solving the issue,"" she said. ""What we want to achieve with a DLT is eliminate these digital silos that appear today.""  In the view of Crook at RBS, We.Trade has gone for the traditional platform play and created a single centralized business model over a closed, private cluster of Fabric nodes.  ""We are disappointed that we.trade has moved in this direction,"" Crook told CoinDesk. ""It reminds us of the Time Warner-AOL merger in the late 90s where Time Warner believed by purchasing AOL they would own the gateway for most U.S. consumers to the 'internet.'""  Getting it done  On the other hand, We.Trade, which currently comprises Deutsche Bank, HSBC, KBC, Natixis, Rabobank, Societe Generale, UniCredit, Banco Santander and Nordea, says it can proceed more nimbly than Marco Polo.  ""We are ahead of the pack because we are not a consortium,"" Roberto Mancone, chief operating officer, We.Trade, told CoinDesk. ""We are a legal entity and we are able to license solutions to banks and that's the main difference. We can license today and are not asking for banks to help us to build something.""  Regarding the argument around future interoperability with the likes of insurance firms, he said that We.Trade is structured with an API architecture that can easily allow third-party providers on the platform.  In terms of connecting with other platforms, Mancone said that while it's not a priority at the moment he wondered what the future might hold in terms of connecting R3 Corda and Hyperledger, adding:  ""I haven't seen a real case of interoperability yet between Corda and Hyperledger. But maybe they can start talking in the future. Why not?""  The standalone nature of trade finance deployments on Hyperledger, in the form of We.Trade and Batavia (which has the backing of IBM and Swiss bank UBS), may be what spawned a recent rumor that the two platforms might even merge.  But Mancone waved this claim away.  ""We work on Hyperledger; they work on Hyperledger,"" he said. ""Theoretically, it's good to know that there are some players out there using the same technology which increases the possibility of expanding platforms going forward.""  Need for speed  And not all trade finance banks see things the way NatWest does. Nordea Bank, based in Sweden, offers an illustrative counterexample in its rationale for going with we.trade rather than Marco Polo.  Nordea was one of the first banks to join the R3 consortium and was also one of the early players around the table to talk about the Marco Polo project. However, in November of last year the bank decided to join the We.Trade platform, almost as an antidote to blockchain prototyping fatigue.  Ville Sointu, head of emerging technologies at Nordea, explained that after being brought in at the bank midway through last year he gathered the blockchain team under one roof and shut down almost all the prototyping. Nordea has narrowed its efforts down to We.Trade, plus a real estate pilot with the Finnish government, and a corporate identity blockchain.  Sointu said his team needed to understand the operational realities of making a blockchain network live in a banking environment.  ""Those learnings are invaluable as we start to look at more complexity down the line and for other use cases as well,"" he said.  Sointu said he remains a big supporter of R3's Corda and wishes Marco Polo all the best in its plans.  ""The reason we kind of scaled back the Marco Polo activity in favor of We.Trade was that We.Trade offered a clear business case and a clear path to production,"" said Sointu, concluding:  ""We just selfishly wanted the experience of going into production.""

To this day, Coinbase does not list tokens for trading it has determined to be securities (see page 68 of its last quarterly filing).      Editor's note (Dec. 24, 2020, 16:15 UTC): The headline for this article was overstated. Coinbase acquired the broker-dealers but not permission to list security tokens.        U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has received regulatory approval to acquire several securities firms – a move that could eventually see it supporting trading in tokens deemed as securities.  A spokesperson for the exchange said in an email response to CoinDesk on Tuesday that the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has approved recently revealed acquisition deals for currently regulated firms.  Last month, the exchange announced that it intends to purchase three companies – Keystone Capital Corp., Venovate Marketplace and Digital Wealth LLC – as a means to becoming a regulated platform for offering trading in security tokens, as well as to tokenize traditional financial assets.  As reported by CoinDesk, Coinbase's chief operating officer and president Asiff Hirji indicated that, through the acquisitions, the exchange is seeking licenses as a broker-dealer, an alternative trading system and a registered investment adviser.  The move by the noted U.S. crypto exchange comes at a time when financial watchdogs in the U.S. are beefing up scrutiny over cryptocurrency projects, especially initial coin offerings (ICOs), and would seem to be positioning the firm for a future when current legal gray areas have been clarified in new regulation.  The SEC has said it is currently investigating dozens of token projects, and its chairman Jay Clayton recently said in a public hearing that he believe every ICO he's seen is a security.  Coinbase general manager Dan Romero told CoinDesk in a previous interview that the exchange wants to add new digital assets commonly requested by customers, but it must tread carefully while U.S. regulators deliberate on how they might treat certain uses of the tech.  He said at the time:  ""When we get to a point that we know which digital currencies and assets are securities, which ones are commodities, money or currency, it would be immensely helpful.""  Just days ago, though, Coinbase announced it is exploring the potential listing of five additional cryptocurrencies on its platform, news that quickly resulted in soaring prices for the assets.  Coinbase currently offers trading of bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ethereum and litecoin, and has said it will soon add support for ethereum classic.  Editor's Note: An earlier version of this article indicated that Coinbase said on Monday it had received approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It later corrected that statement in an email, saying that the SEC was not involved in the process.

42381042,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93JJF,1531821612,Bitcoin Price Retakes 50-Day Moving Average in First Since May,"Bitcoin (BTC) scaled the crucial 50-day moving average (MA) on Monday for the first time in nearly two months, taking its price above $6,700.  The corrective rally picked up the pace 24 hours ago, possibly due to reports stating that BlackRock, INC – the world's largest asset manager and exchange-traded fund (ETF) provider – is considering venturing into cryptocurrency markets. Later in the day, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink clarified rumors by stating that he doesn't see a huge demand for cryptocurrencies from clients,  Still, BTC remained bid and closed (as per UTC) above the 20-day MA for the first time since May 20, validating the argument that a short-term bottom has been made at $5,755 (June 24 low).  While a move above the 50-day MA is encouraging, it does not qualify as a bullish reversal. Only a convincing break above the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline of $6,838 would confirm a short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change.  At press time, the leading cryptocurrency is changing hands at $6,720 on Bitfinex – up 5 percent in the last 24 hours – and the 50-day MA is located at $6,720.  Daily chart  BTC's rally from the two-week low of $6,080, hit on Thursday, to today's high of $6,771 has established a higher low (bullish pattern) on the daily chart.  Further, the relative strength index (RSI) has moved above 50.00 (in bullish territory) and the short-term moving averages (5-day, 10-day) are beginning to rise in favor of the bulls.  So, the cryptocurrency looks set to test $6,838 (inverse head-and-shoulders neckline hurdle), albeit after a minor intraday pullback as the short-duration charts are flashing overbought conditions.  4-hour chart  The RSI is stationed well above 70.00, indicating the rally from $6,080 is overdone. So, prices could revisit the 10-candle MA support of $6,580 in the next few hours.  View  BTC looks set to test $6,838 (inverse head-and-shoulders neckline), albeit after a minor pullback as the cryptocurrency is looking overbought as per intraday technical studies.  A close (as per UTC) above $6,838 would confirm a short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change and would open up upside towards $7,920 (target as per the measured height method). That said, bulls would still need to observe caution as the area between $7,000-$7,100 is packed with stiff resistance lines.  On the downside, a close below 20-day MA of $6,448 would weaken the odds of an inverse head-and-shoulders breakout.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

Japanese financial giant SBI Holdings formally launched its in-house crypto trading platform, dubbed VCTRADE, last month. Yet, as reported by CoinDesk at the time, the trading service was only available for a group of selected users who pre-registered with the platform last October.  In an announcement released on Tuesday, SBI Holdings said the service is now fully open for users aged from 20–70 who reside in Japan.

The Colorado-based Grid7 is one of 95 grant recipients announced by the DoE on Monday, which all won the second phase of the department's Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program. The grants are intended to fund the projects over a period of two years.  According to the DoE, Grid7 is being awarded $999,363, which is part of the total $95 million that the DoE will grant to small businesses across 26 U.S. states in a bid to advance the country's energy sector using new technologies.  Based on data from the SBIR program, Grid7, with its three-person team, already received a grant of around $150,000 in 2017 through the program's first phase.  The DoE explained that startups which ""demonstrated technical feasibility for innovations during their Phase I grants competed for funding for prototype or processes development during Phase II.""  According to Grid7's website, the project aims to develop a decentralized solar power system that can share energy data from homes, buildings and electric grids in a distributed manner. The goal is to improve power supply efficiency and provide security against cyber-attacks, the DoE added.  The energy department's effort comes as lawmakers in Colorado state working to build a more blockchain-friendly environment.  As reported by CoinDesk in January, the Colorado Senate introduced a bill to allow for use of blockchain tech in replacing the state's existing data collection and maintenance processes, a move aimed to achieve higher levels of data security.  The bill was subsequently approved by the Senate in May and later took effect following the governor's final signature.

42381039,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93JGj,1531800390,Is Pied Piper Serious? How HBO Inspired Crypto's Most Confounding Coin,"""Hey … this is Craig Wright.""  It wasn't, but that was far from the strangest part of the conversation.  Thus began CoinDesk's attempts to determine the identity and intent of the individuals behind ""Pied Piper Coin,"" a parody Twitter account inspired by the HBO series ""Silicon Valley."" Chronicling a plucky startup that suffers hilarious slings and arrows in its quest to remake the internet, the TV show had its characters conduct an initial coin offering (ICO) in May.  So, no one was exactly surprised when, a couple of days later, a Twitter account for the fictional token, Pied Piper Coin, showed up. Less clear, however, was who was behind the account.  Many took it for the kind of corporate Twitter that's fast become fashionable in an age where MoonPie is an absurdist comedy juggernaut. If a has-been confectionary can capture the social zeitgeist, why not HBO? But if that was the case, corporate had given Pied Piper Coin a long leash.  The account's first tweet promised an airdrop – a free distribution of free crypto money – and told followers to tag exchanges so that they'd support the coin (in what would become a pattern, it worked in a dig at Bittrex). In private messages, Pied Piper Coin told us that Craig Wright was behind the account, that XRP was a security, and that yes, the airdrop was real.  But as time went on, Pied Piper Coin's enthusiasm for stoking crypto animosities made HBO backing seem less and less likely.  Interspersed with Silicon Valley-themed jokes about palapas, Teslas and LaVeyan Satanism, the account was laying into crypto's favorite punching bags – not just Ripple (which claims it did not issue XRP) and Craig Wright (who claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto and utterly failed to prove it), but:  Rhett Creighton (who forked zcash, merge-forked that fork into bitcoin, then proposed another merge-fork of bitcoin);  John McAfee (for his unorthodox social media evangelism);  CoinMarketCap (which listed Bitconnect, which is accused of being a Ponzi scheme);  Tron (which allegedly plagiarized its white paper);  Iota (which was too quick to call Microsoft its ""partner"");  Roger Ver (a bitcoin evangelist who pledged allegiance to bitcoin cash and then insisted on calling it ""bitcoin"");  the list goes on.  Certainly, the account's fluency in crypto argot, memes and beefs was impressive. But who was it, and what was their goal? Eventually the person behind ""@piedpipercoin"" stated in their bio that they have nothing to do with HBO. (CoinDesk reached out to HBO to confirm that, but they did not respond before press time.) But far from being settled, things only got stranger after that.  At first it seemed pretty clear what was happening. A principled prankster was using ""Silicon Valley"" memesas a megaphone to call out bad actors and inject some healthy skepticism into crypto Twitter.  The person behind the Pied Piper account told CoinDesk:  ""We are using humor to help remind the cryptosphere of all the shady things that have occurred and to help the broader community avoid these mistakes. […] People need to learn their history before they can progress into the future. Our way of teaching is through humor.""  Others were inspired to follow their lead, with the crypto-meme ecosystem expanding beyond Pied Piper Coin.  PPCash insisted that its ""vision of the new internet has been the true path from the start"" (a send-up of bitcoin cash originalism). Meanwhile HooliCoin promised, ""Soon the world will understand centralized cryptos are the way of the future"" (a parody of corporate blockchains).  Yet amid all the jokes, Pied Piper Coin appeared to be serious about doing an airdrop. And that would complicate matters.  A scam?  The integration of a real cryptocurrency into the experience left a bad taste in the mouths of fans.  Neeraj Agrawal, the head of communications at the cryptocurrency policy think tank Coin Center and a powerful engine of crypto-memes in his own right, laid into Pied Piper Coin days after its appearance.  He wrote:  ""Leave it to crypto to turn a mention of your thing on a popular TV show from cute parody account to scam airdrop within a week.""  The narrative that Pied Piper Coin's creators might be out for a quick buck took hold as it became clear that the project was, in fact, creating an ethereum-based token. The creator's continued anonymity and a brief media blitz, in which he appeared on crypto YouTube shows wearing a Guy Fawkes mask and a Peter Pan hat, did little to counter that perception.  As May progressed, the price of PPI (""PPC"" was taken) shot from a couple of cents to over $1. It has since fallen back down to nearly nothing.  Many of the ingredients of a classic crypto scam appear to be there: marketing that (briefly) implied backing from a legitimate, mainstream entity; an unaccountable team; a token without a product; aggressive social media promotion; a brief spike in the price followed by a long jaunt towards oblivion.  Plus, on May 28, the piper (let's call him that) sold 4,500 PPI over the counter ""to recoup some costs from the coin.""  And yet there are a couple of problems with this tidy scam narrative: Pied Piper Coin, as its creator pointed out on Twitter and in an interview with CoinDesk, never accepted investor money. It was a free airdrop, not an ICO. And we know about the OTC sale because the piper announced it publicly.  Whether Pied Piper Coin is remembered as a scam will likely depend on whether it follows through with its masked founder's increasingly ambitious promises.  Seriously serious  While corresponding with Pied Piper Coin's creator, it became clear he was serious – or at a minimum, serious about convincing us he was serious.  ""PPI will have one of the biggest communities in crypto. We believe a lot of developers will be building on top of Piperchain,"" he said.  A one-pager posted to Steemit in late May straddled the line between parody and roadmap, proposing forking one of a few major blockchain protocols to create Piperchain and building decentralized applications (dapps) on top of it – but closing with a flurry of trolly hashtags: #HailSatan #WenPalapa #WenTesla.  In an email a couple of weeks later, though, the piper was adamant that Piperchain would happen – in Q3 no less.  The line separating plans from parody was still fuzzy, though. ""Hopefully we integrate all the fluff words,"" he wrote: ""Masternodes, Atomic Swaps, Sharding, Plasma, Lightning, etc.""  In a call in mid-June, however, the piper had much more concrete plans for Piperchain: a fork of EOS that removes the constitution, increases the number of block producers (the network participants who maintain the blockchain) from 21 to 50, and decreases the number of tokens that participants need to stake. (He's no longer targeting Q3, he added.)  Between questions to a server about what a ""fully dressed"" grilled chicken sandwich entailed and side-bar conversations with Kenn Bosak, a cryptocurrency and cannabis enthusiast, the piper explained two dapps that a team of four developers (""stallions"") was building to run on Piperchain.  One would let users vote on which of two memes they prefer, with tokens going to the winning side, he said. The other would use geocaching to allow users to complete quests in the physical world.  (At the time of writing, the roadmap on the project's site is still firmly in parody territory.)  The piper said that he and Bosak were on their way to make a ""surprise appearance"" at Dogecon.  Dogecoin's heir  Perhaps the appearance shouldn't have been a surprise. Pied Piper Coin's founder told CoinDesk in early June, ""We see dogecoin as the standard bearer for the meme-coin space.""  And, to be fair, memecoins have turned over the years into somewhat of a cottage industry. First gaining traction in 2014, dogecoin may have faded away, but it never actually died. (Its market cap even briefly passed $1 billion in 2017).  Dogecon, a four day ""un-convention,"" further brought together dogecoin enthusiasts in Vancouver in late June. The event was a showcase of what's made the project so appealing: its large, dedicated fanbase who won't let the joke go.  In this environment, Pied Piper Coin might even make sense. Dogecoin, founded by Jackson Palmer and Billy Markus in 2013, is the original memecoin, growing out of a popular image in which a nervous-looking Shiba Inu uses ""very"" and ""such"" wrong.  Its community has combined a serious devotion to the decentralized idea of cryptocurrencies with utter refusal to take themselves seriously. And unlike so many cryptocurrency projects that promised to decentralize the world and make their investors fabulously rich, only to fail in a more or less dramatic fashion, dogecoin has survived through nearly five years of enthusiastic self-parody.  Watching the piper sit on a panel with Palmer and discuss the philosophy of memes, the question of whether he's ""serious"" seemed just as absurd as the question of why he's dressed that way – or why grown men and women are talking about dog-themed internet money – would in any other context.  Among Palmer's other side projects is ""are we decentralized yet?"", a site that tracks various metrics of decentralization for major cryptocurrencies. Pied Piper Coin's founder appears to share a similar set of priorities, and was quick to decry the warped motivations he sees as taking over crypto.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Too much of the space is empowering those very things we were wishing to overthrow. The space is getting excited about Wall Street and banks getting involved with the space. It shows people are more interested in their own individual greed than the actual reason crypto was created.""  Dogecoin and Pied Piper Coin seem to occupy the same delicate singularity, where sincere – even naive – idealism and cynical parody are one.  In the spirit of memes, though, a picture is worth more than words:  Last supper image courtesy of Pied Piper Coin",NEUTRAL,없음,BCH | DOGE | SHIB | AIRDROP | TOKEN SALE,David Floyd,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/07/17/is-pied-piper-serious-how-hbo-inspired-cryptos-most-confounding-coin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e5e333dfeec6648599fa40b2e9bc4d89ee8ee04b-833x339.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42381043,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93JKV,1531786508,Augur Betting Volumes Just Topped $1 Million (And They're Accelerating),"Prediction platform Augur is fast attracting fans, at least if new data is any indication.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, figures from Predictions.Global, a website that allows users to view Augur markets without installing the app, show the platform saw a spike in ""open interest"" from Sunday to Monday. A metric that denotes how much is being risked on the outcome of real-world events, open interest leapt by 51 percent to more than $325,000 over the period.  That news comes less than a week after Augur's launch, at which time it quickly (but briefly) became one of the top 5 applications on ethereum. One of the first large-scale applications to be deployed on the world's second-largest blockchain, it's believed the market could one day become a large-scale vehicle for the crowd-sourcing of human knowledge and expertise.  Still, while it's early days for that aim, the data makes clear Augur has enjoyed rapid growth in the sum of money users have put on the line, and that the number and variety of markets is increasing. Predictions.Global's data also underscores the speed at which Augur markets are attracting funds.  Open interest surpassed $100,000 on July 11 – the first full day of betting – then rose to $200,000 on Sunday and $300,000 Monday.  In this way, the figures add to the growing data on the new product, most of which paint a similar picture.  Another data provider, DappRadar, which measures the total transaction volume passing through Augur's smart contracts (rather than open interest), has found over 3,000 ether has traded on the platform since launch (worth nearly $1.5 million at the current exchange rates), with more than one-third of that total trading within the past 24 hours.  God and ether  Still, in other ways, uses of Augur are arguably becoming more diverse. Predictions.Global's data shows a steady rise in the number of prediction markets created by Augur users, to nearly 320 at the time of writing.  To be sure, money at stake is heavily concentrated in a small number of markets, and most have seen no betting activity at all.  A single market – for whether the price of ether will exceed $500 at the end of the year – accounts for around half the open interest on the platform (nearly $150,000) and drove most of the increase in open interest over the past 24 hours.  And of course, as one might expect from an open, decentralized platform, users have offered some frivolous predictions.  For example, more than one market solicits bets on the existence of God, to be determined (in one case) by news media reports before January 1, 2020. (Interestingly, the app shows that someone is willing stump for a ""yes"" on the God question, if they can find someone to take the bet.)  Virus spreads  The variety of markets that have sprung up is notable, too.  ""We've seen terrific US dollar volume, terrific market creation growth, innovation in the types of markets created and their characteristics in terms of how folks are starting to use the platform,"" said Ryan Berckmans, co-founder of Predictions.Global.  He specifically pointed to Liquidity Health, a user that has created markets for the spread of epidemic diseases such as human-borne Nipah virus. Liquidity Health's goal is to ""fight disease with better predictions,"" according to its Twitter account.  While skeptics might worry that it's creating a financial incentive to spread viruses, Augur co-founder Joey Krug told CoinDesk that such applications of the platform are ""actually really interesting"" and could provide ""a lot of useful information.""  He added:  ""I'm less concerned about a person trying to spread a disease to make money off of it.""  Other creative uses of the platform have emerged, including an attempt to introduce accountability to the ICO space. MedCredits, which plans to raise money through a token sale, has created a market to bet on whether it will adhere to its roadmap, releasing an application on ethereum's ""mainnet"" – or live blockchain – by October 15.  Around $5,000 is at stake, and the odds of MedCredits succeeding have climbed from 20 percent to 85 percent at the time of writing.  Users vs bugs  But while the data above might give the impression that Augur is thriving, there's one important metric that's less encouraging.  According to DappRadar, the platform's daily userbase peaked at 265 the day it launched, briefly pushing Augur past CryptoKitties in rankings of the most popular dapps. User numbers have declined since, and at the time of writing, the figure stands at 113 over the past 24 hours.  Krug offered a potential explanation, though he said it was just an ""intuitive guess."" People might have tried it during the first couple of days, but been discouraged by bugs, he said, which is reasonable to assume, based on complaints about Augur's user experience on forums and social media.  The Forecast Foundation has issued four updated versions of the app since launch, as well as working with the ethereum node provider Infura to improve connectivity.  As these bugs have been fixed, Krug said, it is possible that users – even if there are fewer of them currently – have become more comfortable that Augur is reliable, so they've put more capital onto the platform. The first markets are scheduled to settle this week, paying out users who bet correctly. If all goes well, that milestone could make users even more willing to stake their money on the platform.  The ultimate goal, said Krug, is for Augur to allow users ""to create markets on essentially anything"" without paying high fees to financial intermediaries. For now, high gas costs on ethereum and other technical limitations mean that goal is years away. But Krug is confident that the technical issues can be sorted out.  He concluded:  ""Right now, what we're doing is looking up the exponential curve.""
