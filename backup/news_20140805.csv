42397837,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEJja,1407273129,Second Round Winners Named in MIT Bitcoin App Contest,"The MIT Bitcoin Project has announced the second-round winners in its summer-long app creation competition, the MIT BitComp.  The winners are Tomorrow Market, a decentralized futures market; Fireflies, a bitcoin-based platform for crowdsourcing goods and service delivery; and Ethos, a system that establishes decentralized online identities.  Of the three, Ethos was the only entry that also succeeded in the first round.  The competition  began in early June and is aimed at stimulating development in the small but growing bitcoin crowd at the storied Cambridge, Massachusetts university. $15,000 in cash prizes are being awarded to developers within the community throughout the event.  Contributions to the bitcoin ecosystem  The MIT Bitcoin Project is spearheading a grassroots effort to create what some have called the world’s first bitcoin economy, with the competition acting as a catalyst for up-and-coming developers.  The conclusion of the first round, which ended in July, saw the distribution of three $250 cash prizes to contestants, and this next round resulted in three prizes worth $750 apiece.  For the second round of the MIT BitComp, entrants were asked to submit a promotional video detailing their projects and showcasing their capabilities. The winning videos demonstrate possible use cases for the apps, setting the stage for the last round when demonstrable versions of the apps will be judged.  Creativity and innovation  Richard Ni, one of the competition organizers, told CoinDesk that this round is a good opportunity for entrants to get creative with their projects, saying:  “We're very happy with the quality of submissions we received for round two. Making a video doesn't necessarily contribute to the end product, but our participants put a lot of time into making high-quality videos anyways.""  He added: ""It's exciting to see these projects progress, and we're looking forward to seeing even more polished projects for round three!”  The next deadline for the MIT BitComp is 24th August, after which the panel of judges will select finalists for five categories. Each winner from the upcoming round will receive $1,500.

42397844,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEJrS,1407267634,Bridging the Talent Gap in the Bitcoin Industry,"For a new industry to grow, it needs smart, dedicated people. However, despite the promise and potential of bitcoin and its many companies, attracting qualified employees can be surprisingly challenging.  The simple fact is, although many startups are founded and initially run by small, experienced teams, bitcoin entrepreneurs must hire skilled staff in order to execute their company's vision. BitPay, for example, one of the industry's largest merchant processors, is now in the midst of expanding its team by 70 employees.  Adam Draper, whose startup accelerator Boost VC incubates bitcoin-related companies, has observed other bitcoin companies dealing with the challenge of talent acquisition firsthand.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Draper said that despite enthusiasm surrounding bitcoin, the fact is many people simply don't have the skills necessary to succeed in the industry:  ""So many bitcoin companies are emerging in the startup space, but when it comes to hiring after co-founder status, all companies are competing very heavily for a very small pool of talent.""  Further, given the bitcoin industry's issues explaining its message to the broader consumer public, a portion of the qualified applicants may be getting turned away.  Michael Gronager, chief operating officer of San Francisco-based exchange Kraken, said that, even in the technology nexus of the Bay Area, many job opportunities in the cryptocurrency space might still seem like a gamble to prospective job seekers, adding:  It is always hard to attract talent to startups, and it is even harder to attract talent to a startup in a new 'risky' technology.  This need for top-tier talent, in a wide range of specialities, was also on display at recent Bitcoin Job Fair events. Held in San Francisco and New York, the meetings drew hundreds of job seekers along with top industry companies such as BitPay, Coinbase and Xapo.  Investments don't guarantee talent  Owing to the immense potential of bitcoin and its underlying technology, as well as the now proven abilities of some of its top companies, the size of the industry's investment rounds has been on the rise.  Bitcoin wallet provider Xapo, which has secured $40m in funding over two rounds, has lead the pack so far in 2014. However, the California-based company has been closely followed by BitPay and mining chip manufacturer Bitfury.  But acquiring capital isn't the hardest part of building a top-tier company, Draper told CoinDesk, saying:  ""It is harder to hire than raise money for bitcoin companies.""  Boost VC's newest accelerator class has 12 bitcoin startups. That's more bitcoin companies than Boost VC has ever had previously, and it means, in due time, those companies will be looking for marketing, customer operations and, most importantly, software development talent.  Building trust  However, despite difficulties attracting talent, not to mention how much it costs to hire developers in and around the industry's central hub of San Francisco, bitcoin observers think the cryptocurrency industry is on the cusp of breaking through.  Bill Tai, an investor, early miner and board member of ASIC manufacturer BitFury, thinks the bitcoin ecosystem has enormous potential to expand:  ""Everything about [bitcoin] is very much in its infancy. The aggregate market cap of bitcoin in the whole scheme of the world's value of all currencies, it's negligible. You wouldn't even notice it. It's like a rounding error.""  Considering bitcoin's primary competitor right now is fiat money, Tai says that the attraction to bitcoin-related career opportunities has a lot to do with how digital currency is perceived by the majority of people.  He explained:  ""I think it takes time for people to build trust and credibility [in bitcoin] both as a currency and as a place to bet your career.""  Fans but not fanatics  There has been plenty of discussion about how bitcoin can revolutionize a number of sectors ripe for improvement, with financial services, legal contracts and capital markets being but a few examples.  That's why hiring managers in the bitcoin industry are looking for people who want to play by the rules even though entrepreneurial cryptocurrency ventures do, of course, require some risk-taking by nature.  Kraken's Gronager said:  ""We want highly skilled, hard working people that are fans of bitcoin as a technology, and perhaps less as a movement – you need to be able to separate business from politics if you want to operate in the highly regulatory space of financial services.""  A migration is slowly starting to happen. People with development skills, in particular, are increasingly moving from big technology companies to bitcoin startups.  Some time ago, litecoin creator Charlie Lee left Google, and he now works as a software engineer at Coinbase. Similarly, Ben Davenport moved from Facebook to become a co-founder at multi-signature startup BitGo.  Tai told CoinDesk that engineering talent migrating to bitcoin companies might require network effects to take place, citing the rise of social networking companies in the firstÂ decade of 2000 as an example:  ""It wasn't very common to have the mainstream engineers of that era going to Facebook. It took Facebook, to get that credibility, several years.""  Filling the need  The issues facing bitcoin need to be solved by smart people with the skills to develop, communicate and strategize its success. At the same time, though, there hasn't yet been mass migration of talent from social media or enterprise software over to the digital currency.  Even so, the ones who do get in early may have opportunity to create real change and perhaps receive a windfall.  Kraken's Gronager said:  ""Bitcoin has some issues that need to be resolved in order to unlock the potential for its mainstream use as a payment and ledger technology. The startups will be vastly rewarded for doing so.""  As the adage goes, for success, startups need to find a problem and provide an elegant solution. This could well be why there is a recruiting company in Adam Draper's most recent Boost VC class trying to tackle the talent issue.  The startup, called Honyebadgr, is run by three experienced recruiting professionals who focus solely on finding skilled workers for bitcoin companies.  Draper told CoinDesk:  ""One of many reasons for Boost accepting a bitcoin recruiting company [is that] the bitcoin services space is heating up with necessary product.""  That 'product' Draper is referring to is talent. And there's not enough of it; a situation that will probably continue for some time, especially within the field of computer science engineering.  For bitcoin, at least, Honeybadgr could be a valuable connector in the industry.  We believe that by exclusively aligning ourselves with a niche vertical like bitcoin, we can provide a more tailored candidate experience, said Ryan Peterson, one of Honeybagdr's co-founders.  Playing matchmaker  Aside from issues stemming from possible New York regulation and banks shutting out bitcoin companies, finding talent to work in the bitcoin industry is a problem that needs to be addressed.  Cryptocurrency-focused recruitment agencies are one resource to help this, but positive developments, such as Dell accepting bitcoin, help raise awareness and legitimacy for the digital currency – especially in tech-oriented crowds that might be looking for new job opportunities.  Yet, Tai believes that most people don't want to bet on a job in bitcoin right now. He said:  ""I think it's because people just aren't paying attention. To many people, the US dollar is good enough. So they don't bother [looking for work in bitcoin].""  Honeybadgr's Peterson said from his experience, however, there are more people working on bitcoin than perhaps some realize.  That's the reason he co-founded the company, and why Draper has put Honeybadgr in its latest Boost batch – they can help make career connections between talented people and bitcoin startups looking to hire.  ""We have found that many of the 'smartest people in the room', so to speak, are working on bitcoin, albeit from behind closed doors. We can help coax them out of their shell and turn their passion from a moonlight hobby into a full time career,"" said Peterson.  Choosing the right person image via Shutterstock.

42397841,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEJoV,1407261614,Argentinian Bitcoin Exchange Loses its Bank Accounts,"Argentina-based bitcoin exchange Unisend stopped customer deposits and bank transfers on Monday after Banco Santander Río and Banco Gailicia suddenly closed its company accounts.  Santander  and Gailicia sent Unisend written notification on 28th and 31st July, respectively. Each cited Article 792 of Argentina’s code of commerce, which says that a banking relationship can be terminated at the request of a bank or its client provided 10 days notice is given.  Unisend partner José Rodriguez told CoinDesk that the exchange does not expect its services to be affected in the long term, stating:  “We have other banking relations and are working to open new ones in case any other contingency arises. Operations are continuing as usual.”  About 90% of users transfer money to Unisend from their bank accounts. The other 10% deposit cash through payment processors like RapiPago ARS, PagoFacil, CobroExpress and BaproPagos, among others.  For the time being, customers can still use their bank accounts to transact with the exchange as the Unisend accounts aren’t set to close until later this week. The company aims to have its other accounts ready for user trading before then.  Government activity  Rodriguez said that the company logged one of its most active trading days on 31st July, the day after Argentina defaulted on its debt. That day saw trading activity hit a month-long high, he said.  He also explained that by his observations, trading activity is closely connected to price changes, and that last week brought the only surge he’s seen in the last 60 days that was not related to price.  Rodriguez said:  “We think it was mostly for users to keep their money safe elsewhere, and not the Argentinian peso. Bitcoin users feel safer in bitcoin […] due to [Argentina's] high inflation, unknown economic forthcomings, bank restrictions and capital control, restricting free movement of capital.”  But, the news of the bank account closures also came just days before new rules imposed by Unidad de Información Financiera (UIF), Argentina’s chief anti-money laundering (AML) agency, took effect on 1st August.  Last month, the UIF ordered all financial services companies in the country to report transactions that involve bitcoin and digital currency. The document it issued suggested that the agency would act as a conduit for information to enable greater oversight of such digital currencies.  “We rather suspect it has to do with the new UIF resolution and reporting obligations Resolución N0. 300/2014,” Rodriguez said about the account closures.  The Argentinian bitcoin community  Whatever the reason for the banks’ actions, Argentina still stands as a country that bitcoin champions have looked to as one that can best demonstrate the potential of bitcoin. The country has an active and growing community and bitcoin companies with well-established presence.  There is still no mass adoption, Rodriguez said, but people that understand its potential and reach stay tuned, or attempt to get more actively involved.  He continued:  “There have been initiatives which are moving faster than the rest of Latin America, like the Argentinian Bitcoin Embassy, Argentinian companies getting funding and growth, professionals focusing and creating projects and companies related to bitcoin, co-working spaces and frequent events around the country. By the end of the year, this could lead to the mass adoption as an alternative economy.”  Latin American presence  Unisend is Argentina’s first homegrown bitcoin exchange, started by Pablo and Tomas Esterson this January. Rodriguez joined in March. According to local sources, it may have been the only exchange service to have had domestic corporate bank accounts, suggesting a widespread crackdown on the country's bitcoin businesses may not be likely.  Other major bitcoin exchanges and buying services catering to the market include Bitex.la, which has its corporate operations distributed internationally, and ConectaBitcoin, a peer-to-peer alternative to LocalBitcoins.  Rodriguez said the team wanted to create a trading platform that offered person-to-person trading and provided an option for those that want to connect with their bank accounts, something many bitcoin enthusiasts oppose.  He said:  “Our plan is to become the first Latin American exchange with local banking relationship in various countries in Central and South America, as well as bringing bitcoin solutions such as payment processors, exchanges and remittances for major adoption.”  The three-man team is replicating its business model in Mexico. Unisend Mexico is poised to open within the upcoming two weeks. An official launch date has yet to be determined but it is already open to users for registration.  “More products and services need to be integrated to the economic cycle,” Rodriguez said. “This would create a growing alternative economy, which could be more stable and efficient than the regular one is right now, and have a wider reach.”  Note: The original version of this article stated that Unisend was the country's only bitcoin exchange, and the only exchange that could connect to local bank accounts.

42395304,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASaHEu,1407256486,Sink or Swim: Bitcoin's Progress in France,"The French Senate recently published a report on bitcoin which warned that a continued focus on the digital currency's risks could distract from its true potential, especially its “nearly inexistent” transaction fees and robust security.  Though the document calls for some level of state regulation, it seems fair to say that the French government's approach to bitcoin is becoming increasingly positive.  But do changes at Senate-level reflect a real shift in French attitudes towards digital currencies? Is bitcoin really catching on in the country?  Advocacy centres and hackathons  “The ecosystem isn't really developed yet, but the scene is starting to shake up,” bitcoin advocate Thomas France told CoinDesk. If anyone were to know about it, it would certainly be him: he co-founded the Association Bitcoin France (ABT) alongside current president Philippe Rodriguez. He is also part of the team behind La Maison du Bitcoin, Paris' bitcoin advocacy centre.  The only centre of its kind in Europe, the 220-square metre space opened on 13th May in the heart of the city. It houses several co-working spaces and one of France’s two bitcoin ATMs, alongside monthly bitcoin meetups and regular bitcoin 101 events. Importantly, the centre is open every working day for anyone wanting to learn more about cryptocurrencies.  A hackathon the centre organised in June proved to be a success, as Thomas explained:  “It definitely was a great start, and people were full of ideas. We were surprised by the amount of developers who turned up, and happy about the number of talented people willing to invest their time, money and brains on bitcoin.”  While definitely promising, events like this still remain anecdotal: the interest may be here, but it hasn't yet turned into a more concrete reality.  Not just Paris-centric  Ranking 4th behind the US, Germany and the UK, France has 5.18% of the world's bitcoin nodes (the relay points that store, verify and transmit transactions across the network). The country comes 8th in the world for the number of people who have downloaded the original bitcoin client in the past year.  Despite this, the country lacks brick-and-mortar shops accepting the cryptocurrency: the total figure (as listed on CoinMap) is known to be over 40 but almost certainly below 100.  This doesn’t keep Thomas France from being optimistic about the future involvement of businesses: there are, he says, a lot of shop owners visiting La Maison du Bitcoin in order to learn more about the technology. This includes a restaurant in the same street as a building, which recently started accepting the currency.  Though Rue du Caire has seemingly become the nation's bitcoin hub, this doesn’t mean the rest of France hasn't been doing some catching up.  There are frequent bitcoin meetups in Lille, Bordeaux and Toulouse among other destinations, and there are several communities of miners scattered across France. A quick look at CoinMap also shows that some local businesses have started accepting bitcoin in smaller towns: they are still few and far between, but a beginning nonetheless.  A bout of bad news  France's small but steadily growing community may have hit a road bump, however, given recent bad press in the country's media.  The first issue arose on 7th of July when two people were arrested and an illegal bitcoin exchange was dismantled in Cannes and Nice. The police seized a portfolio of 388 bitcoins, in what was the first ever judicial action resulting in the closure of an illegal exchange for virtual currency in Europe.  Less than a month afterwards, on 4th August, Le Monde ran a comprehensive piece on the multiple failings of Mark Karpeles, the (Gallic) man behind the downfall of one-time biggest bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox.  The newspaper found that before his short-lived career in bitcoin, the CEO had been sentenced to a year in prison and €45,000 in damages to his ex-employer on hacking charges.  Government to the rescue?  Though both these stories involve outright criminal behaviour rather than anything that would be considered normal bitcoin activity in the community, the harm may have already been done.  Given that cryptocurrencies being used as intended will hardly make headlines, negative articles may well be the only things many people have heard about bitcoin. The idea of a virtual currency, in its current state, may already only appeal to a minority, and negative coverage from mainstream outlets probably do not help.  This is where today's Senate report could come into play: showing that virtual currencies are safe enough to receive some level of backing from the government may be all that is needed to regain some public confidence.  This will likely happen before the end of the year, but in the meantime, bitcoin in France may remain the hobby of a minority for a little while longer.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Marie Le Conte,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/08/05/sink-or-swim-bitcoins-progress-in-france,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ff2c615af72bbb6cbff5cee27542a46b4cd0b799-1251x503.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Offering a mix of news, markets data and analytics, Thomson Reuters Eikon was launched as a competitor to Bloomberg terminals, the 320,000-subscriber strong tool that helps empower Wall Street and professional traders.  Eikon will now display the price of bitcoin in USD as tracked by major Europe-based digital currency exchange Bitstamp.  Thomson Reuters cited strong customer demand as the impetus for the decision, which notably follows Bloomberg's 30th April announcement that it would list bitcoin prices using data from US-based digital currency exchanges Coinbase and Kraken. Bloomberg has since added data from Bitstamp and itBit.  The official announcement promised to extend Eikon users the same level of functionality they are accustomed to from the service, stating:  ""Traded rates and volumes as well as top of book quotes are all now available for you to act before the market moves.""  Thomson Reuters also cited bitcoin's recovery following the insolvency of Japan-based digital currency exchange Mt. Gox and the addition of major merchants such as Expedia and DISH Network to its ecosystem as strong signs that the market is maturing.  Eikon's bitcoin features  Thomson Reuters said that users of its Eikon product can take advantage of professional tools to track news and link to graphical analysis.  New bitcoin-specific offerings for Eikon include:  A time and sales viewer that displays volume-weighted average price (VWAP)  Daily open, high, low and close data  Intra-day and end-of-day charting for quotes, trades and volumes  Three-year traded rate and volume history  Top-of-book bid and ask size  Traded rates and volumes (in BTC).  Bitcoin traders that may considering adopting the platform were further encouraged by Thomson Reuters to try a free demo offer of Eikon.  Increasing market attention  In its full remarks, Thomson Reuters went on to discuss bitcoin's relative success given its uncertain legal and regulatory status in most countries around the globe.  Despite these challenges, the company evoked broad and complementary language to describe bitcoin and the reasoning behind its decision to add the sometimes controversial asset to its trading platform, saying:  ""Despite the skepticism expressed by many counter parties, the phenomenon of cryptocurrencies needs to be monitored as it brings on several implications on industry assets and practices (such as payment systems and the role of the banks), but also on regulatory ground (links with anti-money laundering legislations).""

42397831,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEJfe,1407239425,Russian Ministry of Finance Drafts Bill Banning Bitcoin,"Update (12th September 22:30 BST): Deputy Head of Russia's Ministry of Finance Alexei Moiseev has said Russia is likely to pass its digital currency ban in the spring of 2015, according to a report by Russian business news agency Prime.  ""We might accept this law during this session, but most probably we will do it in spring,"" Moiseev said.      Russia’s Ministry of Finance has announced proposals to ban the issuance of bitcoin and any operations involving cryptocurrency.  On Friday (1st August), the Finance Ministry announced on the government's regulation website that it was drafting a bill relating to cryptocurrencies, which, if approved, will likely see those who break the new laws end up in jail.  The announcement said:  “According to Article 27 of the Federal Law 'On the Central Bank of the Russian Federation' (Bank of Russia) the official Russian currency is ruble. The issuance of monetary surrogates in Russia is forbidden as well as the introduction of other monetary units. However, monetary surrogate has no standard definition in the Russian legislation.”  The Finance Ministry plans to make amendments to Article 27 of the Federal Law ‘On the Central Bank of the Russian Federation', specifically banning the use of monetary surrogates, including cryptocurrencies. According to the ministry, the ban is necessary as monetary surrogates are widely used for buying illegal goods and money laundering.  Moreover, the government agency intends to restrict access to websites that enable people to buy, sell, transfer and use cryptocurrencies.  “Сryptocurrencies have no real value and their prices are determined due to speculations. So, there is a great risk that investors will lose their money,” the ministry's statement concluded.  Burykina Natalia, chairman of the State Duma Committee on Financial Markets, believes there is no sense in imposing the criminal responsibility for using cryptocurrencies in Russia.  “[Even] if the Finance Ministry thinks that bitcoin can compete with the ruble, this threat isn’t severe for the moment. According to the Russian legislation, the ruble is the only legal payment instrument, something else can just be an exchange instrument. If someone wants to exchange [bitcoin], why should we interfere?” she said.  Bitcoin's current status in Russia  The legality of bitcoin has been discussed frequently in Russia since the beginning of this year. The Bank of Russia was the first government agency in the country to warn citizens and businesses about the risks associated with digital currencies like bitcoin.  The central bank also mentioned that involvement in bitcoin transactions and exchange services would be considered as “potential involvement in the implementation of suspicious transactions” in accordance with existing legislation on money laundering, as well as counter terrorism legislation.  In February, Russia’s General Prosecutor’s Office also issued a statement on bitcoin, stating:  “The official Russian currency is the ruble. The use of any other monetary instruments or surrogates is forbidden.""  The issue was discussed in government in June, when the Ministry of Finance was ordered to draft a bill specifically outlawing the use of all monetary alternatives, including cryptocurrencies.  On a more positive note, the Wall Street Journal last month reported that the Bank of Russia said it would not seek to take harsh measures against cryptocurrency use.  Bank of Russia deputy chairman Georgy Luntovsky said: “At this stage, we need to watch how the situation develops with these kinds of currencies. These instruments should not be rejected.”  Discussion on the bill is open until the end of this month and, if approved, the amended act will come into force in 2015.

42397888,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEJnW,1407234552,How Coinbase Brings Bitcoin to Billion-Dollar Merchants,"Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam didn't hesitate to set lofty goals for his company entering 2014, as he quickly predicted his company would enroll no less than 10 billion-dollar businesses in its services before the year's end.  It was a bold claim for the bitcoin merchant processor. At the time, Coinbase had enrolled just one billion-dollar merchant, Overstock.com, and despite enthusiasm that more would come aboard, months would pass without another major announcement.  Then, just as quickly, the company's stable of major names expanded. In late May, the second billion-dollar merchant joined the ecosystem with the addition of satellite TV service provider DISH, and just as quickly, major brand names like Expedia and Dell followed suit.  To date, the bitcoin ecosystem has six billion-dollar merchants, and four of them accept payments through Coinbase. TigerDirect and Newegg accept bitcoin through Coinbase's rival BitPay.  The man at the helm of this quick narrative turnaround is Adam White, the company's business director. White oversees a team of four employees whose job it is to educate merchants about the benefits of bitcoin, and ultimately, to convince them that aligning with bitcoin is right for their brand.  White told CoinDesk that, across the board, he has seen his team's conversations with major merchants become easier, remarking:  ""They're beginning to understand that it's more than just a digital currency, that it's more than a payment network, it's a real bottom-line benefit to merchants and consumers.""  In a new interview with CoinDesk, White opened up about the company's success with major merchants, delving into how this conversation is becoming easier for his team every day.  Starting the conversation  Using Dell as an example, White illustrated how Coinbase's typical conversations with potential merchants proceed, often taking months of deliberation to complete.  White said that his team first reached out to Dell prior to the company's decision to go private last October, and that Dell was specifically targeted because the company believed it had a customer base that would overlap with the average bitcoin user.  This led to follow-up conversations covering bitcoin's basics, the benefits it could provide Dell, and how the integration would work.  The talks weren't greeted with an initial green light, however. But that soon changed, according to White:  ""They reached out to us a couple months later and said, 'This is something that Michael Dell and our team want to do. We’re now a private company and have the flexibility to really respond to our customers' needs, and this is something our customers really want. Can you help us turn this on ASAP?' We said: 'Absolutely'.""  From there, Dell took the lead on the integration, with Coinbase playing its typically supporting role, assigning a dedicated engineer to help Dell's team understand the documentation and ensure the integration went smoothly.  Then and now  White said that when he joined Coinbase in October 2013, after departing his previous position as a product manager for gaming company Activision Blizzard, conversations with major merchants went much differently:  ""At that point, it was difficult to point to other name-brand merchants and publicly traded companies like Overstock that were using bitcoin and actually show them here is real top-line revenue growth and bottom-line cost savings.""  It wasn't just the addition of one company, however, that was solely responsible for the transition. Rather, he said that it was companies like Overstock and CheapAir – two of the company's larger, early clients – that were able to demonstrate real success in taking bitcoin payments. White added:  ""Now, we're showcasing those results and it really helps change that conversation from what could be to what's been happening, and we're able to, in a general sense, model out what the impact would be and it helps the merchant assess their opportunity cost.""  Notably, CheapAir recently announced it passed $1.5m in total bitcoin payments processed, while Overstock is expected to soon expand bitcoin to its global customers.  White went on to say that success stories like these are helping more merchants to understand the opportunity of accepting bitcoin, and to look at Coinbase as a partner.  ""I think when they take that closer look, they really get excited about it. It eliminates risks like chargebacks, fraud, credit card scams, and now they're realizing there's a way to work around that and that bitcoin is the best solution for it,"" he said.  Emphasizing overall adoption  White said that although the exposure provided by billion-dollar merchants does benefit the entire community, Coinbase doesn't necessarily emphasize these businesses over others that may more broadly spur overall enrollment.  For example, he said, platforms like Spree and Shopify that allow thousands of smaller businesses to benefit from bitcoin are just as important as billion-dollar merchants.  ""While we hope to bring on those billion-dollar merchants, it's important for us also to bring on billion-dollar platforms and sites that favor the mass adoption of bitcoin,"" White said, adding:  ""At the end of the day, we want to bring bitcoin to as many merchants as possible.""

42397829,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEJdg,1407226679,China Exchange OKCoin to Launch Bitcoin Futures Trading,"Chinese exchange OKCoin announced today it will add futures trading to its platform, saying it is one of the first major exchanges in the world to offer users the chance to trade futures denominated in bitcoin.  OKCoin's  futures trading, which will be in beta for the next two weeks before going live, partly solves bitcoin's price volatility problem and reduces risks by allowing bitcoin earners to 'lock in' a future price.  More advanced traders can use futures to utilize higher leverage opportunities for price speculation. Trading of derivatives like futures also serves to move volatility away from the underlying asset and ultimately causes prices to become more predictable overall.  Professional trading tools  Founder and CEO of OKCoin, Star Xu, said it was part of the company's plan to bring institutional and professional trading tools to digital currency investors and help build the bitcoin trading platform of the future:  ""Today’s launch of bitcoin futures trading capabilities builds on the algorithmic trading tools we pioneered and launched on our platform last month. We have already seen a favorable response from institutional and individual investors. We are helping to make participation in bitcoin a more safe and stable process. The ability to trade futures will further cement our position as one of the world’s leading bitcoin exchanges.""  OKCoin’s chief technology officer Changpeng Zhao said that OKCoin would ascertain it was gathering accurate pricing data with a US dollar index based upon prices from 10 different bitcoin exchanges.  Reducing risk in bitcoin investment and trading was a major factor in increasing bitcoin adoption, he added.  Seeking more professional customers  Beijing-based OKCoin, like mainland China's other 'big three' exchanges, is increasingly seeking business from a new breed of professional digital currency traders in lucrative external markets like Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and the US.  Along with new English-language sites and support, the companies are adding a variety of 'pro' features. Huobi has just opened its margin trading system and interest-bearing bitcoin 'savings accounts' to all after a successful six-week beta trial, and BTC China's new mobile app offers real-time market data and a fast-trading interface.  Other Asia-based exchanges, like Hong Kong's Bitfinexhttps://www.bitfinex.com/pages/features and BTC.sx, which is dual-incorporated in the UK and Singapore, also offer their own implementations of margin trading and derivatives.  OKCoin itself launched an English website, P2P margin trading and a range of algorithmic trading tools in June, with an aim to making things easier for larger- and higher-volume traders.  The largest mainland Chinese exchanges offer extremely low or even 0% trading fees, which also attracts high frequency traders and increases liquidity.

42397842,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEJpU,1407211870,Huobi's BitVC Opens Bitcoin Interest Accounts to All International Customers,"BitVC, the Hong Kong-registered subsidiary of China-based digital currency exchange Huobi, has officially opened its margin trading and digital currency savings accounts to the international public.  Huobi's  margin trading platform BitVC and its 'Yubibao' wallets, which also function as interest-bearing savings accounts, had been in an invitation-only beta phase since June.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Huobi's Robert Kuhne said that more than 5,000 users had signed up and used their accounts during this trial period, with about 30% of current BitVC account holders residing outside mainland China.  Kuhne went on to discuss how the company's Yubibao wallets were proving especially popular, and that the company's recent international awareness efforts had spurred enrollment, saying:  ""At The North American Bitcoin Conference (TNABC) bitcoin conference in Chicago last month, there was quite a lot of interest from the media and attendees, with many people asking for invitation codes. But now BitVC registration is open to everyone.""  Yubibao savers earned a cumulative total of 350 BTC over the trial period, he added.  Earning interest with 'Yubibao' wallets  Depositing funds into a Yubibao wallet implies that you are making those funds available for use by margin traders. Rather than users making individual loan offers and waiting in a queue as occurs with other similar systems, BitVC/Yubibao puts all available funds in a single pool for faster results for both traders and investors.  Yubibao wallet accounts are available automatically when a users registers an account with BitVC. These accounts are aimed more at regular consumers than professionals – there is no minimum amount a user can deposit, though there is a maximum of 500 BTC and 40,000 LTC.  Interest is paid daily, with the average rate hovering around 0.02-03%. BitVC guarantees Yubibao users' funds – its system includes automatic margin calls to ensure traders have enough assets to ensure their loans, and the company says it maintains a large bitcoin reserve to cover any losses.  BitVC's security measures include SMS verification, Google Authenticator, backup passwords and a backup contact should an account sit unused for a long period of time.  Courting the pro trader market  Other large Chinese and Asian exchanges, such as Beijing-based OKCoin and Hong Kong's Bitfinex, have also sought to attract the region's population of finance professionals with margin trading, live statistics and more full-featured mobile options.  Continuing regulatory uncertainty in the US also leaves traders in the world's largest economy with no full-fledged local option, giving Asian and European exchanges a head start.  With BitVC, however, Huobi is the first Asian exchange to launch an entirely separate name and brand to separate more sophisticated operations like margin trading from its primary exchange business.
