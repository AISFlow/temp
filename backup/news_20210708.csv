The company has begun assembling a team to handle the project, said hardware lead Jesse Dorogusker in a tweet, emphasizing the product is very much in the drawing-board stage. Nevertheless, he said Square will seek to bring a mobile-friendly, “assisted-self-custody” wallet to a global audience.      “We have decided to build a hardware wallet and service to make bitcoin custody more mainstream,” he said in the tweet. Square CEO Jack Dorsey followed up: “We’re doing it.”      Square’s status as a mainstream fintech would likely inject new attention into bitcoin custody. It has much wider name recognition than even the best-known hardware builders in the crypto industry. Square has carved out a niche in making bitcoin accessible through its Cash App. And Dorsey is himself aligned with the cryptocurrency on philosophical grounds.

42406844,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8PpQ,1625782518,Osprey's Bitcoin Trust Ups the Ante in Race to Displace GBTC,"Osprey Funds is filing to register its Osprey Bitcoin Trust (OBTC) as a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reporting company.      If the U.S. regulator deems the Form 10 filing effective, Osprey would become the second cryptocurrency investment vehicle to become an SEC reporting company, following the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).      Osprey is part of a crop of new bitcoin funds aimed squarely at the market-leading GBTC before a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) is approved by the SEC. This includes offerings from Bitwise Asset Management, BlockFi and CrossTower that look to give traditional investors exposure to bitcoin without having to touch the asset itself.      The Osprey registration would increase transparency and liquidity for the trust, requiring it to file audited financial statements with the SEC. It would also reduce the holding period for OBTC shares from 12 months to six months, putting it on par with GBTC. (Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk’s parent company.)      Also similar to GBTC, Osprey can be accessed directly by accredited investors and indirectly by retail investors via over-the-counter (OTC) trading desks.      OBTC boasts a 0.49% management fee compared to GBTC’s 2% annual fee, but the Osprey fund also has 0.3% in other expenses from services such as crypto custody.

Roger Nils-Jonas Karlsson, 47, was also ordered to forfeit a Thai resort he purchased with the stolen funds and $16,263,820 in restitution, DoJ said in a release Thursday.      From 2011 to 2019, when he was arrested in Thailand, Karlsson ran an investment fraud scheme using the name Eastern Metal Securities. Karlsson promised his victims “astronomical returns” on their investments, paid in bitcoin and other online payment methods tied to the price of gold. Instead, Karlsson kept the money and used it to fund a string of expensive properties and a racehorse.      Karlsson pleaded guilty to the scheme in March.      Karlsson’s sentencing is one in a recent series of fraud charges brought by different U.S. agencies against individuals, as regulators attempt to clamp down on illegal activities in the crypto space.

Bitcoin broke below initial support at $34,000 and is down about 5% over the past 24 hours. The cryptocurrency could stabilize around $30,000, which is the bottom of the month-long trading range.      There is a lack of a “real catalyst or market-moving events right now,” wrote QCP Capital in a Telegram chat. “We expect volatility to remain under pressure until mid [to] late August.”      “With BTC, we have seen some funds speculate that the lack of narrative combined with lower levels of liquidity on exchanges may lead to a pop in prices if a positive headline is to occur,” wrote Chris Dick, quant trader at crypto trading firm B2C2.    Latest prices    Cryptocurrencies:    Bitcoin (BTC) $32962.45, -4.68%  Ether (ETH) $2157.6, -8.93%    Traditional markets:    S&P 500: 4321.07, -0.85%  Gold: $1801.8, -0.11%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.3%, compared with 1.318% on Wednesday  Regulatory headwinds    Growing concerns from regulators have been weighing on cryptocurrency prices over the past few months. This week, China’s crackdown intensified when the nation’s central bank issued a warning about the risks of stablecoins.      ""Global stablecoins may bring risks and challenges to the international monetary system,"" said Fan Yifei, deputy governor of the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) on Thursday. The banker also said the central bank was already taking measures against cryptos.      In Europe, several countries are proposing forming a new agency to crack down on cryptocurrencies that could potentially be used for money laundering. Concerns also include terrorist financing and organized crime, which should be addressed at the European Union level, according to documents reviewed by Reuters on Thursday.      Cryptocurrency risks were also reviewed by 15 West African nations during parliamentary meetings on Thursday.      And in the U.S., Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) gave the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) until the end of this month to figure out its role in regulating cryptocurrencies.    Grayscale discount    Some analysts are not convinced that bitcoin could receive a boost from the expiration of investor restrictions on the sale of shares in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), the world’s largest cryptocurrency fund. (Grayscale is a unit of Digital Currency Group, of which CoinDesk is an independent subsidiary).      “We don't expect these unlocks on [their] own to have significant impact on the overall market outside of GBTC itself,” QCP Capital wrote in a Telegram chat.      “Most of the large institutional positions who had subscribed in-kind before have already been unlocked earlier, and they have held off selling at the current discounted price.”    Flows shifting from stablecoin cash to crypto    The stablecoin supply ratio (SSR), which measures the relationship between bitcoin supply and stablecoin supply, is stabilizing after a sharp decline from the January peak.      “A low SSR implies high quantities of stablecoins on the sidelines – or more buying power to purchase risk-on digital assets,” wrote David Grider, strategist at Fundstrat, in a Thursday newsletter.      SSR shows that flows have shifted from bitcoin to stablecoins for most of the year, but recently bottomed out. This could point to investor confidence in bitcoin’s price direction as stablecoin cash is put to use.    Circle to go public    ​​Circle, operator of USD coin, the world’s second-biggest stablecoin, announced it is listing on the New York Stock Exchange via an acquisition by Concord, a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, led in part by former Barclays CEO Bob Diamond. The deal values the crypto financial services firm at $4.5 billion.      The Boston-based firm generates income in three ways, according to its investor presentation: from transaction fees on USDC and interest earned on its reserves; transaction and treasury services (TTS); and SeedInvest, the equity crowdfunding platform it purchased in 2019.      Jeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle, wrote in a tweet that the transformation from a private to a public company “creates an opportunity for Circle to also provide significantly more transparency about the business we are building around USDC, and about the reserves that back USDC.”      USDC has grown to about $25 billion outstanding from less than $1 billion a year ago, while an increasing number of investors have demanded more insight into assets backing the stablecoins.    Altcoin roundup  Circle losses from email fraud: Circle lost over $156 million on its blockbuster buyout and subsequent jettisoning of the crypto exchange Poloniex, the payments company revealed Thursday. The company also lost another $2 million to email fraudsters in an “incident” that occurred last month.  Terrorists hold crypto: Israeli officials have moved to seize potentially millions of dollars in cryptocurrency from addresses it says are controlled by Hamas.

42394457,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvedaT,1625772075,You Might Benefit From Crypto Therapy,"Bitcoin and crypto trading has undoubtedly affected many negatively. From a psychological perspective, it’s easy to predict the volatility of this field can lead someone into a storm of stress and anxiety. Just the fact that this industry operates 24 hours a day will encourage dysfunctional behaviors such as compulsive price checking, losing sleep or obsessive thoughts about the market. Even the most sophisticated investors are not prepared for the intense fluctuations in crypto, and so it's no surprise this industry has now claimed its piece of the pie in mental health disorders.  Patty Fiore is a psychotherapist at Next Step Counseling who specializes in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and EMDR to treat trauma, depression and anxiety.  As a psychotherapist, I'm treating clients who are suffering from anxiety regardless of the position of their trades. Whether their portfolio is up or down, they are stressed over what decision to make next. When the crypto market is up and investors experience a sudden increase in wealth, celebratory drug and alcohol abuse often follows. When the price of bitcoin and other crypto currencies drop, investors experience anxiety, major depression, PTSD and panic attacks. Clinically speaking, some of these clients are traumatized and their mental health disorders are affecting their overall physical health.  One can easily draw parallels between crypto trading and compulsive gambling. The constant ups and downs of the market create euphoric highs of winning and depressive downs of losing. Just like a synthetic drug, chasing the high is the goal. In a quest to make more money, one often falls into compulsive buying and selling and then finds it impossible to recover from the losses. The inability to stop trading in a down market affects one’s stress level, self esteem, overall confidence and financial security.  Just as cigarette packages warn smokers about the hazards of smoking, crypto exchange companies owe it to their users to alert investors of the psychological dangers of compulsive gambling.  Read more: Addicted to Crypto?  Sadly, there are very few who seek help or therapy as a tool to manage their investing-induced anxiety. In the worst scenarios this could be deadly. Alex Kearns, a 20-year old Robinhood user, took his life after mistakenly believing he lost a $730,000 risky bet.  The emotional roller coaster of trading is not for everyone and platforms such as Robinhood have not taken enough precautions to vet their users' financial experience. Whether you are trading stocks or crypto, it's imperative to learn how to handle the emotional stress that automatically comes with the market. Mental health professionals can facilitate a safe space to create appropriate boundaries and build healthy coping mechanisms.  Like any industry, psychotherapists also need to evolve to understand quickly evolving industries like tech and crypto, and to encourage clients to bring those issues to their sessions. Therapists who understand these dynamic industries are more equipped to conceptualize their clients' needs and process their feelings and decisions in a more efficient manner.

42406835,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8PkV,1625771896,Regulators Everywhere Should Follow Wyoming’s DAO Law,"July 1 marks the first time individuals and organizations in the blockchain industry can create a legally recognized Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) in Wyoming. Prior to the law, which passed in April, no formal legal recognition of DAOs existed anywhere in the world.      Wyoming’s DAO LLC legislation represents the boldest attempt to close the gap between formalized corporate structures and unincorporated groups governed by rules coded in smart contracts. Regulators around the world should consider passing equivalent laws in their jurisdictions to ensure legal protection for those developing and participating in DAOs.    Andrew Bull is founding partner at Bull Blockchain Law.    Failing to do so will result in continued regulatory ambiguity and increased risk for those operating in the blockchain industry.    Read more: State of Crypto: What Regulators Said at Consensus 2021  1. Regulating DAOs    DAOs are informal organizations of individuals who rely on smart contracts to enforce collective decisions without human error or manipulation. Today, DAOs are frequently deployed for many purposes such as decentralized finance (DeFi) governance, fundraising, exchanges and real estate lending, all powering billions of dollars in transactions without intermediaries. The opposite of a formalized corporate entity, DAOs disrupt regulatory frameworks for entity formation and governance due to the lack of a centralized individual and/or group operating the entity.      For example, Elon Musk controls Tesla, and has controlling authority over whether Tesla will accept bitcoin as payment for Tesla cars. Imagine if, instead, all Tesla owners had this decision-making power and voted on whether Tesla would accept bitcoin. This represents the shift from authoritative to DAO collective decision-making.      While industry advocates believe this shift is the next evolutionary step in corporate governance, prior to the Wyoming DAO Law, DAO developers stood in legal limbo, unsure of their liability for acts carried out by the DAO. That’s still the case outside of Wyoming. Under current laws, most states in the U.S. would treat DAO participants as “partners” in a common law partnership, which exposes a participant’s personal assets to the DAO’s lawsuit settlements and liabilities.      Now, the Wyoming DAO Law formalizes protection for DAO developers by prohibiting lawsuits against DAOs as general partnerships as well as enforcing the rights of DAOs as legal persons in state court, thereby protecting the developers individually. No longer do developers have to grabble with the uncertainty of whether they could be held personally liable simply by creating a DAO. Wyoming provides DAO members with the same limitations on individual liability afforded to members of limited liability companies (LLCs).    2. The need for expansion    The DAO should no longer be viewed as an experiment, and other jurisdictions should seek to promote the expansion of blockchain technology by codifying laws recognizing the DAO structure and protecting developers, users, and stakeholders. DAOs currently hold billions of dollars in assets, and operate in many different industries, from fintech to real estate. To foster innovation and development, regulators should take immediate steps towards legally legitimizing the DAO structure.      In 1977, Wyoming became the first U.S. state to recognize the LLC structure. Eleven years later, the IRS ruled an LLC would be treated as a partnership for tax purposes and states started to pass statutes recognizing LLCs as an official business form.    This is just the beginning of how innovative DAO legislation can be.    The LLC was an experiment created by Wyoming in response to the need for a flexible business entity stripped of rigid corporate formalities attending the corporate form. It borrowed the best of both worlds from the corporation and the partnership: limited liability for shareholders and informal procedures for decision making by partners.      While the Wyoming DAO law does not set forth a radically new structure, it takes the first steps towards formulating regulatory standards and practices for DAO-based corporate operations. This will open the gates to allow further legislation built off of the DAO Law.      For example, we anticipate Wyoming passing legislation in the future that will legally recognize DAO structures in corporations, foundations, trusts and other corporate entity structures. This is just the beginning of how innovative DAO legislation can be, and collaboration between foreign jurisdictions would lead to further development.      The Wyoming DAO Law not only protects stakeholders in the industry, it also allows the traditional judicial system to evaluate and verify blockchain transactions and smart contracts as legitimate proofs of ownership and transfer. For example, DAO developers and users are now able to prove transactional history, voting rights, and decisions made via the DAO in court. Without legislative recognition of the DAO structure, far more ambiguity would exist within the courts over verifying these smart contracts, costing additional time and resources.    3. DeFi compatibility    With the massive expansion of DeFi, the DAO Law could be revolutionary in solving the ever growing disconnect between regulators and decentralized protocols. Even the largest DeFi protocols have little to no formal legal structure in place, exposing protocol developers to increased liability.    The current approach is reactionary rather than proactive    Of course, DeFi protocols are intentionally lacking a formalized entity, but this is typically a byproduct of protocol developers championing technological innovation and hoping they fly under the regulatory radar. Unfortunately, this stifles innovation due to the carried risk that deters entities from launching similar protocol structures.      A formalized DAO structure could provide legal security to entities looking to innovate in the DeFi industry. Currently, regulators deter DeFi protocol development by solely focusing on anti-money laundering issues arising from the developer’s inability to prevent anonymous protocol usage in foreign jurisdictions. While this is certainly a legitimate regulatory issue, the current approach is reactionary rather than proactive.      Decentralization at its core conflicts with bordered regulatory requirements. However, detering innovation solely on the basis of the technology not fitting squarely within the current regulation should not be the norm. Unfortunately, the current state of the industry is just that: disconnected. Formalized legislation would allow for far more innovation in the coalescence of DAOs and DeFi Protocols by expanding regulatory recognition of these technologically unique structures.    4. Room for improvement    The law possesses limitations that other regulators should further clarify in subsequent legislation. It is unclear whether a Wyoming-recognized DAO would maintain its legal status in a United States federal court case.      Additionally, if the DAO has a threshold number of members, would the reporting requirements of Section 12 of the Exchange Act of 1934 become a factor? Unless an exemption applies, an issuer that is not a bank, bank holding company or savings and loan holding company is required to register a class of equity securities under that act if: it has more than $10 million of total assets and the securities are held by either 2,000 accredited investors, or 500 persons who are not accredited investors.      Such companies are referred to as “Reporting Companies” and are required to meet ongoing disclosure requirements detailing material changes in the financial condition or operations of the issuer. Reporting companies must file periodic reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K with the SEC. Future legislation should address these issues.    5. Conclusion    These unknowns cannot be clarified by Wyoming regulators alone. Other jurisdictions, domestic and foreign, need to follow suit to establish full legal standards and best practices for DAO operations. Most importantly, the U.S. Congress and European Union should be looking to the Wyoming DAO Law for guidance on this issue.      Many other legal issues are likely to emerge over time as DAOs are formed and go through various stages in their corporate lifecycles. While legal precedent involving LLCs and their members will be instructive in resolving issues with respect to DAO governance, taxation, and disputes, case law addressing issues unique to DAOs will develop over time. Wyoming’s DAO law lays the first brick on a long path towards a complete regulatory framework and widespread acceptance for DAOs.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION,Andrew Bull,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/07/08/regulators-everywhere-should-follow-wyomings-dao-law,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/29a7a2020a6e1c1a0f85ed99419a8a03c9196387-2560x1791.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406840,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8PmT,1625771313,An Alternative Theory for China's Tech Crackdown,"Is this the real reason China is cracking down on tech?      When Chinese authorities on Tuesday ordered ride-hailing service Didi Chuxing’s app removed from all Chinese app stores, they justified the move based on vague concerns about the company’s collection of user data. But there may be a more compelling explanation, not just for the Didi crackdown, but for China’s broader moves against bitcoin mining, its disciplining of Jack Ma and its efforts to build a heavily surveilled digital yuan.    David Z. Morris is CoinDesk's Chief Insights Columnist.    Shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, which runs Hong Kong’s stock and futures exchanges, jumped more than 5% the day after the extent of the Didi crackdown became clear, a move highlighted this morning by Morning Brew. The Brew’s read is that this suggests investors foresee a major pullback of Chinese companies from U.S. or international stock markets. That would mean more initial public offerings and other equity trading in Chinese companies would go through Hong Kong markets.      China’s leaders haven’t stated this is a strategic goal, but there’s significant evidence for the theory. As I noted Tuesday, Chinese authorities warned Didi not to proceed with its IPO, but it went ahead anyway. Meanwhile, regulators in Beijing are aiming to change China’s securities laws to close the loophole that allowed Didi and others to list internationally, according to Bloomberg. (That revision would also reportedly limit listings in Hong Kong, so those two data points do seem somewhat contradictory.)      Since its action against Didi, Chinese authorities have also opened investigations into three other U.S.-listed tech companies over concerns of “national data security risks.” Those companies, like Didi, won’t be allowed to register new users during the review period, which could last up to 45 days.      That will likely be devastating for the businesses, and the actions could very well scare other Chinese tech companies away from listing internationally if the clampdown is seen as retaliation for going to Wall Street. The crackdown has also led to calls from U.S. legislators to impose more scrutiny on the listings of Chinese companies.      But why? The Didi case shows clearly how such limits could hurt Chinese companies. When it went public last week, Didi attracted $4.4 billion in capital on the New York Stock Exchange, presumably largely from non-Chinese investors (those investors are now suing Didi). Though Didi operates worldwide, a huge portion of that capital will certainly go to salaries and other expenditures within China, boosting not just one company, but the entire national economy. Restricting that international investment would make it harder for Chinese leaders to deliver on the continuing prosperity that cements their control.      That could be because Chinese enforcers are catering to the financial elite in Hong Kong at the expense of tech companies. The former British colonial outpost was long the gateway for financial flows between East Asia and the rest of the world. But crackdowns on political freedoms since Hong Kong’s return to Chinese control, and particularly in the past five years as Chinese President Xi Jinping consolidated power, has raised concerns that its financial sector could suffer. Keeping more deals flowing through Hong Kong could be an attempt to prop up the industry, and perhaps to demonstrate to bankers there – not all of whom are happy with Beijing’s rising control – which side their bread is buttered on.      The moves also seem to fit into the broader context of China’s program of financial surveillance and control. That program includes the continued development of a central bank digital currency that could be tightly monitored and controlled by China’s central bank, and the crackdown on Ant Group, which offered personal finance and payments tools to individuals. Constraining international stock listings could similarly help China maintain its policy of strict capital controls, which limit both foreign ownership of Chinese assets and the movement of Chinese funds outside the country’s borders.      All that said, it would be simplistic to read the crackdown as entirely about the Communist Party consolidating financial control.      The crackdown has also affected tech companies like Tencent, which is not listed abroad. The U.S. backlash to Chinese stock offerings was an unintended consequence, China specialist Jude Blanchette told CNBC. And in other financial realms, specifically commodity futures, China is trying to open its markets to foreign participation as a way to increase its global influence.      Those points support the idea that the latest wave of crackdowns is at least in part truly motivated by cybersecurity concerns. China’s moves, though far more aggressive, also broadly mirror recent efforts in the U.S. and Europe to enforce better data privacy standards on internet companies.      “We’re moving from almost no regulation [of the] internet [in China] to more regulation,” Chinese investor Qi Wang commented to CNBC. “Of course during this transition, the pressure may seem high because [of] the low base.”",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,David Z.

42406830,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8Pfa,1625767951,"USDC Is Only Circle’s Second-Biggest Business, SPAC Filing Shows","Most of the conversation about Circle revolves around USD coin (USDC), the stablecoin it created in collaboration with Coinbase.      But according to an investor presentation released with Thursday's announcement that Circle would go public using a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), the company has three lines of business, all generating growing revenue. Of those, USDC is only the second-biggest contributor to the top line.      Circle has been a mainstay of the more corporate and institutionally focused side of the cryptocurrency industry. Started by Jeremy Allaire and Sean Neville as a peer-to-peer payments company that once had a strong bitcoin orientation, it has evolved into an infrastructure company supporting much of the blockchain industry, and that infrastructure work appears to be its strongest area for revenue growth.      The Boston-based firm generates income in three ways: from transaction fees on USDC and interest earned on its reserves; transaction and treasury services (TTS); and SeedInvest, the equity crowdfunding platform it purchased in 2019.      Its transaction and treasury services are probably the least understood and least detailed part of its offerings. ""Circle Accounts and API services provide companies with a comprehensive suite of payments and treasury services,” the investor presentation says.      The presentation lists Dapper Labs, Compound Labs and FTX among the TTS business’ clients.      The slide deck does not give prior-year results, but it estimates that Circle will generate $115 million in revenue in 2021, but end the year with a $76 million loss.      Of those revenues, it expects $40 million to come from USDC, $65 million to come from TTS and $10 million from SeedInvest.      The company also projects $76 million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) on $886 million in total revenue across the three business segments by 2023.

42406857,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8PtM,1625767105,"Circle CEO Says USDC to Take High Road, But It's a Long Road","With his company on the cusp of going public, Jeremy Allaire – CEO of Circle, operator of USDC, the world’s second-biggest stablecoin – has vowed to make his company ""the most public and transparent operator of full-reserve stablecoins in the market.""      He has a ways to go.      ​​Circle announced Thursday that it is listing on the New York Stock Exchange via an acquisition by Concord, a special-purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, led in part by former Barclays CEO Bob Diamond. The deal values the crypto financial services firm at $4.5 billion.      After the announcement, Allaire wrote in a tweet that the transformation from a private to a public company “creates an opportunity for Circle to also provide significantly more transparency about the business we are building around USDC, and about the reserves that back USDC.”      Allaire made the promise at a time when a growing number of commentators have called for greater insight into the assets backing stablecoins like Tether's USDT, the largest in the cryptocurrency category with about $63 billion of assets. No. 2 USDC has grown to about $25 billion outstanding from less than $1 billion a year ago.      Regulators and industry analysts have warned that a loss of confidence in stablecoins could destabilize cryptocurrency markets and potentially even spread to Wall Street.      The issue could take on even more significance if Circle's projections for its own growth prove accurate: In a presentation Thursday, Circle executives estimated that USDC in circulation could more than double to $83 billion next year and reach almost $200 billion by 2023.      The presentation mentions the word ""reserves"" only once – to point out that USDC earns ""interest income on reserves.""      Circle did include the following line in fine print in a list of ""risk factors"" on page 45 of the 46-page presentation: ""We have obligations to safeguard the assets of our customers, and any failure to do so could negatively impact our business and result in liabilities, regulatory enforcement and reputational harm.""      The company has been issuing monthly ""attestation"" reports on its assets since 2018. According to those reports, it had been holding all of its customer funds in federally insured U.S. banks until the end of February 2020. In its subsequent attestation report for the month ended March 31, 2020, Circle added the category “approved investments,” without specifying what those were.      Despite mounting inquiries from investors and the media, Circle has not disclosed breakdowns of the ""approved investments"" or the amount held in them.      During an interview with CoinDesk TV on June 30, Allaire didn’t directly answer questions on what the investments were, though he said there’s a “very narrow set of permissible financial instruments that are able to be held” according to the law.      ""If you look at it, it's obviously cash. It's, you know, government treasuries, those types of short-term instruments,"" Allaire said. ""We don't break out the actual individual line items in USDC reserves, but what we do is actually publish exactly what we are required to do and we make it very clear that we are holding ourselves to an even higher standard.""      The pseudonymous blogger known as Bitfinex'd, a long-standing critic of tether and stablecoins generally, published a post on Medium on Wednesday chronicling the changes in how Circle has characterized its reserve assets.      ""You can’t claim to be transparent if you’re unwilling to be transparent about your reserves,"" the post read. ""It’s not illegal to show people what you’re holding. You’re holding other people's money, and other people’s livelihoods and families are dependent on you, and they deserve to know what the hell they’re holding.""      As CoinDesk columnist JP Koning pointed out, Circle is licensed as a money transmitter with 44 state-issued licenses, and regulations on the investment scope for such entities vary from state to state.      Texas imposed tighter restrictions for those entities to invest only in safe assets, while states such as New York and Connecticut allowed money transmitters to invest in commercial paper and preferred shares of publicly listed companies.      As the stablecoin market grows, it has drawn increasing concerns from regulators and experts for the potential impact on digital assets as well as on traditional markets like stocks and bonds. Stablecoins play a key role in the plumbing of the $1.4 trillion global cryptocurrency market. Traders use them to quickly move dollar value between exchanges in order to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities.      Some traders, analysts and economists have speculated that financial losses at Tether or other stablecoin issuers, or even a crisis of confidence, might trigger a sell-off that could put downward pressure on prices for other cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin.      “Stablecoins will never be as stable as dollars, physical or digital – and may even require a bailout when panic over broken promises spreads,” wrote Marcelo M. Prates, a CoinDesk columnist, central bank lawyer and researcher.    Raft of warnings    Fan Yifei, a deputy governor of China’s central bank, has voiced concern that stablecoins could pose a risk to the stability of the global financial system.      Eric Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, made similar remarks last month.      “I do worry that the stablecoin market that is currently, pretty much unregulated as it grows and becomes a more important sector of our economy, that we need to take seriously what happens when people run from these type of instruments very quickly,” Rosengren said.      Fitch, the bond-ratings firm, warned last week that the rapid growth of stablecoins could have implications for the functioning of short-term credit markets.      In May, the Federal Reserve published a survey of market contacts finding that brokerage firms, investors, political advisers and academics increasingly see cryptocurrencies and stablecoins as a threat to the stability of the financial system. Global regulators have been studying the potential risks from stablecoins since at least 2019. European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde echoed the concerns last year.",NEUTRAL,USDT | USDC,BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | USDT | USDC,Frances Yue,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/07/08/circle-ceo-says-usdc-to-take-high-road-but-its-a-long-road,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8148222947c2988029dfff55d77f542d2a6cafb9-1279x818.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406850,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8PuL,1625765955,Elizabeth Warren's Bitcoin Blind Spot,"After a pandemic year in which a craze for all things cryptocurrency spread over a housebound U.S. population, political battle lines are now being drawn over the issue. At a Senate hearing in June, Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) fired what seemed to be an early warning shot on the issue on behalf of many progressives skeptical of the phenomenon. Bluntly describing crypto as a tool to “scam investors, assist criminals and worsen the climate crisis,” Warren called for federal regulators to take steps to help “drive out bogus digital private money.” It was a sentiment that likely resonated with supporters of the liberal senator, many of whom have already been beating the drum about a technology they view as a source of pure speculation and waste.    Murtaza Hussain is a reporter at The Intercept who focuses on national security and foreign policy.    On most issues, my political sympathies in the U.S. fall left of center. I’m in favor of treating quality healthcare and transit as a public good, urgent action to combat climate change, a fair system of taxation and peaceful cooperation with nations abroad. But I’ve realized that I’m a bit of an outlier when it comes to the subject of crypto: I don’t hate it. To push it further than that, the more I learn about the technology, the more I can envision cryptocurrencies and blockchain being applied as tools to restrain corrupt institutions and loosen the grip of an incumbent elite that constantly lies, fails and abuses its power, and yet never seems to face real accountability for its actions.      Consider the role of bitcoin, the first and most famous cryptocurrency, which today is somewhere near the level of global public adoption that the internet reached in the year 1997 when it had roughly 200 million users. Bitcoin was conceived as a form of permissionless money, recorded on a decentralized ledger known as a blockchain. Transactions on the blockchain ledger are immutable and transparent, and they can't be censored. The wealthiest users can’t change the rules of the system in their favor, nor can they block the poorest users from having access to it. The only technology anyone on Earth needs to take part on equal terms in the network is a phone with internet access.      The energy expenditure of Bitcoin, which Warren criticized in her Senate hearing for being frivolous, is designed to protect the ledger from malicious attack by raising the resource requirements for attacking it. Contrary to popular belief, the blockchain ledger is not a black box impervious to surveillance. But in a manner similar to encrypted messaging platforms, the system is designed in a way where targeted surveillance of individual users may be possible with enough effort, but mass surveillance of everyone is not.    Bitcoin is neither perfect nor above criticism    How attractive such a system sounds to you is likely to be a function of how repressive you believe that society can be and how satisfied you are with the current global financial system.      After more than a decade spent documenting the domestic and foreign impacts of the U.S. global war on terror, my own opinion is that our society has the capacity to be extremely repressive and the financial system, as presently constructed, is frequently used as a weapon in the hands of unaccountable elites.      The U.S. government for its part has used the dollar and its control of global financial infrastructure like SWIFT to wage economic warfare on entire countries to devastating effect. It has surveilled, blacklisted and shut down legitimate businesses and aid organizations across the world that have had the misfortune of falling on the wrong side of Washington D.C.’s political divides. For millions of innocent people whose lives have been ruined by this global dragnet, as well as those living under undemocratic regimes subject to their own unaccountable domestic monetary regimes, there’s often no question of justice, let alone compensation, when they find themselves blacklisted and the value of their labor frozen or confiscated.    Read more: Elizabeth Warren Gives SEC July 28 Deadline to Figure Out Crypto Regulation    Bitcoin is not a silver bullet against such abuses. But it’s certainly a start. The tech entrepreneur Naval Ravikant once referred to it as “a tool for freeing humanity from oligarchs and tyrants, dressed up as a get-rich-quick scheme,"" a statement that speaks well to the feelings it arouses among both casual investors and ideological supporters. Bitcoin’s existence also looks like it is going to become much more important in the years to come, as global finance develops into something even more powerful and overbearing than it is today.      Overlooked in Liz Warren’s widely reported June 9 statement attacking Bitcoin were her accompanying remarks endorsing the creation of a digital version of the U.S. dollar. Warren was right to mention that there are potential merits to state-run digital currencies, including increased access to financial services for unbanked people and easier implementation of monetary policy. But a future world of such currencies, in which bitcoin has been regulated out of existence by righteous progressives, will also be a world in which mass surveillance and social control is possible on a scale unprecedented in human history.      A future U.S. Treasury Department wielding the digital dollar would have the ability to monitor and block transactions of disfavored people and organizations at the push of a button, even confiscating or force-spending their money if so desired. In China, a digital yuan with programmable capacities is already being promoted for use within and beyond the country’s borders, without the slightest pretense that the Chinese Communist Party will respect quaint notions like human rights when push comes to shove. It would not be an exaggeration to say that in such a future, a fully independent, online decentralized currency would be the only safe haven for individuals fleeing the threat of economic coercion by the two great superpowers of our time. For some, it already is.      Bitcoin is neither perfect nor above criticism. In my view, it’s not impossible that it could even be replaced by another cryptocurrency with superior scaling, design and function. But rather than offering constructive criticism of Bitcoin or possible alternatives for people threatened by the emerging state-backed digital currency order, the scorched-earth response from progressives like Warren functions as a defense of it. The only reassurance they offer is a dubious bet on the permanent goodwill of government authorities, something that has been in short evidence in the past.      For progressives, many of whom, including Warren, I believe to be motivated by a genuine desire to protect the innocent from harm and restrain the excesses of the state, it’s worth keeping an open mind about new technologies rather than trying to immediately regulate them into oblivion. Decentralized currency technologies like Bitcoin, cryptographically based forms of organizations like DAOs and the use of decentralized blockchain record keeping for property and identity documents could all play an important role in defending human rights at home and abroad. There’s nothing stopping people with left-leaning politics from designing cryptocurrencies and tokens that reflect their own values and incentivize the types of behavior and cooperation that they’d like to see in the world.    Read more: Warren Versus the Volcano | David Z. Morris    Getting to that point will require discarding the technophobia that is in fashion today, as well as the (rather ironic for self-identified progressives) nostalgic longing for social and political forms that existed in the 20th century.      Warren was right on one count when she described cryptocurrency as a “Wild West.” Like the old West, crypto at the moment has more than its share of outlaws and opportunists. But whoever finally tames this new frontier is going to find themselves wielding great power in the decades to come.

42406846,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8PqP,1625763556,Crypto Has a Marketing Issue,"There’s a troubling cultural trend around cryptocurrency, one that encourages retail investors to “ape into” the market in search of riches.      In one recent example, Blockfolio, a crypto-trading and portfolio-tracking mobile app, kicked off an ad campaign with the call to action to buy now. The slogan: “There's a price to waiting, especially when it comes to crypto.” Then there are the celebrity endorsements, paid and unpaid.    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    There isn’t just one factor that drives a bull run, but statements that glorify greed or promote the fear of missing out (FOMO) contribute to turning a bottom-up revolution into a directionless stampede.      According to a survey conducted in May, during the height of the recent market run-up, over one-third of retail crypto investors in the U.K. said their knowledge of the asset class was ""poor” or “non-existent.” One in five said they lacked an understanding even after they invested in crypto.      The survey was conducted by Oxford Risk, a financial services firm, which found that a significant portion of investors were driven by FOMO. Many were persuaded by media coverage of outsized gains or by word of mouth.      Crypto isn’t alone in attracting people to invest with reckless abandon. Over the lockdown year we saw the rise of meme stocks and dog tokens alike. Platforms designed to lower the barrier to investing – “democratize finance,” to use Robinhood’s lingo – did just that.      It’s all part of a trend towards narrative-driven finance, focused on the stories that projects and companies can sell rather than their fundamentals. Some call this moment “financial nihilism,” the idea that everything is rigged so you might as well capitalize. Others advance the “boredom markets hypothesis,” that people cooped up during the coronavirus pandemic are seeking a diversion.      Crypto has a powerful story, and the potential to effect real change. Removing gatekeepers and opening access to financial services is a move in the right direction, for many. In this sense it’s less of an asset class than a tool. Censorship resistance isn’t just a story. Neither is supporting a new class of digital artists.      But crypto will not be a tool to become ultra-rich for many, or even for most. Promulgating that idea is hazardous, but it’s also one of the stories that is most often told about crypto.    Read more: 15 Ways to Stay Sane While Trading Crypto    Spike Lee recently directed and starred in a commercial for bitcoin ATM firm Coin Cloud, where he called crypto a “digital rebellion.” An ad executive who watched the clip was quoted in the New York Times:      “I get very nervous because I start looking at the way that some of the platforms are specifically targeting younger investors.” ... Maximizing is what’s being encouraged here – the idea that this is an amazing asset, and as much as you want to put in, come on and jump on in, the bitcoin’s lovely. … We would never feel comfortable for an alcohol client, or a high-salt or high-sugar or high-fat client, to encourage that level of unequivocal behavior.”      That said maybe ""mass adoption"" always meant endorsements and commercials.

42406843,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8PnS,1625760000,Indexing Protocol The Graph Launches Public Curation Dapps on Mainnet,"The Graph, a decentralized indexing protocol for querying networks like Ethereum, has launched The Graph Explorer decentralized application (dapp) along with Subgraph Studio. The launch, announced earlier today, fully publicizes curation and finalizes decentralization for The Graph Network.      Originally founded in 2018, The Graph processes and validates various subgraphs that are used by Ethereum dapps. Right now hundreds of dapps use The Graph including Aragon, Balancer, Synthetix, Aave, Gnosis, Numerai, Livepeer, DAOstack, Uniswap, Mintbase, Gods Unchained, Decentraland, and many others. In fact, The Graph surpassed 30 billion queries, or bits of information gathered, in June alone.      The launch of The Graph Explorer dapp and Subgraph Studio allows anyone to deploy and curate subgraphs on Ethereum and earn migration rewards paid in its native GRT token.    ""We believe that permissionless, open curation beats extractive algorithms and centralized decision making every time.""The Graph blog post  Read more: Web 3.0 Infrastructure Blockchain ‘The Graph’ Now Live on Ethereum  Subgraphs    A subgraph is a part of a larger database. In this case, subgraphs are lists of useful information pulled from the Ethereum blockchain. A subgraph defines which data The Graph will index from Ethereum and how it will store it. Once deployed, the subgraphs are queried by dapps to fetch blockchain data to power their front-end interfaces.      With the introduction of Subgraph Studio, developers will be able to test and deploy subgraphs on The Graph Network. Developers can also create their own subgraphs with specific metrics that suit their dapps.      Currently, eight dapps (udius, DODO, Livepeer, mStable, Opyn, PoolTogether, Reflexer and UMA) rely on subgraphs that are being produced on The Graph; however, with the release of The Graph Explorer and Subgraph studio, many more will inevitably follow. With subgraphs, users of dapps can be sure the data being provided is decentralized rather than being provided by a third-party indexer.    Network participants    Indexers are participants in The Graph Network that index or sort through subgraphs in order to make data more accessible to users. In return for their services, indexers are rewarded through new GRT token issuance.      When an indexer goes to claim the indexer reward on a given subgraph, the indexer must supply a recent Proof of Indexing (PoI) to do so. These PoIs immediately unlock rewards, but they can also be used later to “slash” an indexer if they are found to be incorrectly formed.      For the most part, however, indexers compete among each other to produce the highest quality and most accurate data to get the reward.    Read more: The Graph Launches Microtransaction System for Blockchain Data Providers    In order for these indexers to find the right subgraph to work on, curators must signal the most important subgraphs. On The Graph Network, curators are responsible for signaling to indexers which subgraphs (open APIs) are most important to decentralized applications by staking GRT tokens.      In return, curators earn query fees. Because curators are given query fees, they are incentivized to stake on only the most important subgraphs that power the most useful applications. Currently, the curator’s cut is 10% of query fees but that rate is subject to protocol governance.      Curation makes sure the most useful and highest integrity data is prioritized to be later used for applications. You can think of curating like a decentralized rating system that tells the indexers which subgraphs are the priorities. When a subgraph is curated, developers can more easily find the right data. The data is easily accessible and essentially “sorted” when accessed for their dapps. With this system, anyone can deploy subgraphs but only the most used and highest quality subgraphs will earn query fees.    Curation Program    The Graph will be one of the first Ethereum-integrated curation markets to go live at this scale.      In preparation for its mainnet launch, The Graph’s Curator Program was announced on Sept. 17. The testnet was set up for curators to complete a series of missions to test the boundaries of the network.      The Graph planned to allocate up to 3% of the total token supply to curators in this testnet program as a grant allocation of GRT to curate on subgraphs. Individual allocations will be based upon contributions and interaction with the testnet such as query volume, profit maximization, data sharing and feedback.      With over 2,000 curators and 210 indexers, The Graph made it possible for even non-technical users to become curators, so long as they joined the GRT testnet with an Ethereum wallet.      Some noticeable curators included companies such as CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap, Messari, Delphi Digital, Zapper, Synthetix, Pool Together, LivePeer, mStable and Balancer.

42406836,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8PlU,1625759525,"Circle Lost $156M on Poloniex Acquisition, SPAC Documents Reveal","Circle Financial lost over $156 million on its buyout and subsequent jettisoning of the crypto exchange Poloniex, the payments company revealed Thursday.      The company is still dealing with Poloniex’s legal woes despite cutting business ties with Poloniex in late 2019, Circle said in a regulatory filing published in support of its move to go public via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). Circle has also lined up millions of dollars to settle a previously undisclosed case brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as well as sanctions violations investigated by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and an “Iranian government agency.”      Circle estimates it will have to pay $1.1 million to $2.8 million to OFAC. Further, Circle has set aside $10.4 million for a settlement offer to the SEC. It does not appear the SEC has brought any formal charges.      It was not immediately clear what the SEC investigated Poloniex for in December 2017, the height of that year’s bull market. The Thursday documents describe a complaint tied to the “trading of cryptocurrencies that may be characterized as securities'' but no further details were available.      The revelation adds another asterisk to one of the crypto industry’s big fizzles. Circle bought Poloniex for $400 million in early 2018 as part of founder Jeremy Allaire’s grand vision to build Circle into a one-stop shop for crypto. Less than two years later, it spun out Poloniex as part of a wider effort to restructure.      Poloniex became an independent entity, but Thursday’s filings show Circle was left holding the legal bags.      In 2019, Circle sold Poloniex to an Asian consortium of unidentified investors, just 18 months after it bought the company. The move was among the first in Circle’s efforts to pivot to a stablecoin-focused business model.      According to Thursday’s filing, Circle retained $26 million in customer funds after spinning Poloniex out. Those were primarily funds belonging to U.S. customers or customers who were “sanctioned.”      While U.S.-based Poloniex customers couldn’t trade their cryptocurrencies, Circle said it will let them withdraw in USDC.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/07/08/circle-lost-156m-on-poloniex-acquisition-spac-documents-reveal,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0a2f0869884313f26443e3bd4cfaf358364af925-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Gamers will be able create a horde of assets to combine with their favorite “Walking Dead” characters. The idea is for users to recreate comic book storylines or to forge their own original adventures, the companies said.      Virtual reality platforms such as The Sandbox and Decentraland have seen adoption skyrocket with NFTs. The Sandbox co-founder Sebastien Borget said the advent of digital cats on the Ethereum blockchain – CryptoKitties, the NFT sector’s first smash hit in 2017 – signaled a paradigm shift.      Borget said:    “We immediately saw the potential to apply that technology, not just to create virtual cats, but to enable anyone to make their own NFTs, exchange them with other users, monetize them on the marketplace, and use them to build games and be rewarded for the time they spend on the platform.”    In addition to providing no-coder game creation tools, The Sandbox has a map of parcels of virtual land for sale. The platform has 166,464 plots of digital land in total, each one an individual NFT, and there will never be more, Borget explained.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) gave the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) until the end of this month to figure out its role in regulating cryptocurrencies.    The senator, who chairs the Senate Banking Committee's Subcommittee on Economic Policy, said in a letter to SEC Chair Gary Gensler that she needs answers by July 28.  Despite the rising popularity of crypto, a ""lack of common-sense regulations has left ordinary investors at the mercy of manipulators and fraudsters,” Warren said.  ""The SEC must use its full authority to address these risks, and Congress must also step up to close these regulatory gaps,"" she added.  Warren has long been critical of bitcoin, describing the crypto as ""speculative in nature and going to end badly"" during a CNBC interview in March.

42406816,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8OQq,1625749248,DeFi Data Feed Service API3 Becomes a DAO,"API3, a service that provides data feeds to blockchain-based smart contracts, is becoming a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), a democratized system of decision-making using cryptocurrency and blockchains.      Announced Thursday, API3’s DAO contains the startup’s treasury worth close to $100 million, gleaned from its token sale at the end of last year, and composed of $23 million of stablecoin USDC and 25 million API3 tokens (valued at $2.75 a piece at time of writing).      Blockchain projects like to espouse some degree of decentralized governance; it’s a good reason to issue a token, for example. But DAOs go the whole hog, handing over the project’s direction and control of treasury holdings to the voting power of token holders rather than a smaller group of governing individuals.      AIP3’s so-called Authoritative DAO has been built using the Aragon DAO creation platform.    How it works    API3 token holders will gain one vote per token staked in the DAO smart contract, where these tokens will be locked up for 12 months, allowing voters to share in staking rewards, starting at 47.12% APY and adjusting downwards as the collateral targets are met, explained API3 co-founder Heikki Vänttinen.      In terms of the API3 use case, providing accurate and relevant data to blockchain smart contracts has become very big business thanks to the explosive growth of decentralized finance (DeFi). API3 says it wants to create a more transparent and accountable data oracle option than Chainlink, far and away the market leader in DeFi data feed provision.      As well as voting to steer the direction of the API3 project, the aim is also to provide a kind of decentralized insurance against oracle failings, Vänttinen said, such as when a critical data feed falters, or perhaps the wrong data finds its way into a DeFi platform, and users can lose money.      “We are going to be providing collateral for an insurance product that’s going to be available to the data feed consumers,” said Vänttinen in an interview. “So, if a data feed goes down, the consumer of that data feed will be able to file a claim to the insurance and then get compensated from the pooled tokens if the claim is valid.”      DeFi and decentralized insurance alternatives like the popular Nexus Mutual platform include oracle failings in the repertoire of risks covered, but Vänttinen argued the API3 DAO insurance provision is better aligned with the overall goals of the project.      “All the people governing the API3 DAO are directly incentivized to keep the data feeds running as they should, and maintain a high quality of operations for the DAO. Because that means there won’t be any outages or malfunctions that would lead to them getting slashed from the insurance pool,” he said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | LINK | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/07/08/defi-data-feed-service-api3-becomes-a-dao,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f88d64be0de71e32f0569357d941426ace840ec6-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406824,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8Oag,1625748300,Bear Markets Don’t Scare Protocol Developers: CoinDesk 2021 Q2 Review,"Bears come out of hibernation in the spring, and that was definitely true in the crypto market. Pressure from Chinese regulators on bitcoin mining and renewed attention on the asset’s overall energy footprint pushed prices down overall. At the same time, development in decentralized finance (DeFi), Ethereum and Bitcoin soldiered on. The CoinDesk 2021 Q2 Quarterly Review looks at the data and stories behind those events and more.      During Q2, most of the assets in the CoinDesk 20, a curated list of the assets that are “core” to the market, declined. Bitcoin (BTC) experienced its third-worst quarter ever in terms of price performance. Meanwhile, ether (ETH) finished the quarter up 18.7%.      In light of the recent market downturn, CoinDesk Research has created a simple litmus test for determining when cryptocurrencies are entering a bear or bull market. Our methodology is as follows: a change of 20% in the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX), followed by at least 90 days in which bitcoin does not return to its previous high or low.      Why just bitcoin? It’s because bitcoin is the benchmark for the overall market, given its large share of the estimated total market value of all cryptocurrencies. As such, barring a reversal in price back above $64,888.99 by July 13, cryptocurrencies are in the early stages of a bear market.      What may have contributed to a bearish reversal of BTC price trends this quarter was renewed regulatory crackdown from the Chinese government against bitcoin mining operations in the country. The majority of Chinese bitcoin miners were forced to either shut down or scale back operations. As a result, Bitcoin’s hashrate, or the total network computational power, fell sharply from ~170 million to ~90 million terahashes per second, and daily average block times spiked to a record 23 minutes during Q2.      In spite of all the bearish market sentiment and negative news, Bitcoin and Ethereum continued to progress technologically in Q2 with the completion of a “Speedy Trial” for Bitcoin’s Taproot software upgrade and the release of Ethereum’s London upgrade on two Ethereum test networks. The continued development of these protocols highlights the actively changing and evolving value propositions of the largest digital assets.      The DeFi ecosystem also continued to adapt amidst bearish market trends with total value locked increasing roughly 13% over the quarter. Notably during Q2, the amount of ETH locked in DeFi decreased, suggesting a rise in other asset types for DeFi collateral and liquidity such as stablecoins, governance tokens and other fungible ERC-20 tokens.

42406822,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8OWk,1625747400,Can Taiwan Become Asia’s Crypto Haven? Not Yet,"With news of a crypto crackdown in mainland China roiling the global crypto market, one might wonder if Taiwan would serve as a haven for crypto businesses. Not exactly, as it turns out.      In fact, whenever Taiwanese crypto lawyer Will Tseng’s clients ask him to suggest the best place to open a crypto firm, he recommends Singapore, where regulations are much clearer.      On July 1, Taiwan’s new anti-money laundering (AML) regulations for crypto entities came into effect. Eight cryptocurrency exchanges were chosen by Taiwan’s financial watchdog, the FSC, for the first stage of implementation, according to Kunchou Tsai, founder and managing partner at Taiwanese fintech law firm Enlighten Law Group.      Three of those eight entities have ceased operations in light of the new anti-money laundering (AML) requirements, Tsai said, which includes reporting transactions exceeding 500,000 New Taiwan dollars (around US$18,000) to the bureau of investigation (FIU).      According to Jason Hsu, a former Taiwanese lawmaker who campaigned to include virtual currency service providers in the list of financial institutions required to comply with the Taiwan’s Money Laundering Control Act, the crypto industry at large feels local regulations are too harsh.      Nevertheless, over the last year, various decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain firms have trickled into Taiwan. Crypto firms are setting up their engineering, sales and marketing teams in Taiwan and are employing local engineers, Hsu said.    Moving to Taiwan    In 2019, tech entrepreneur Leo Cheng reluctantly left Silicon Valley to join his business partners in Taiwan. At first, Cheng was nervous about losing networking opportunities and his colleagues in San Francisco.      “Then COVID-19 happened and none of that really mattered anymore,” Cheng said.      In June 2020, Cheng launched decentralized lending protocol Cream Finance in Taiwan’s capital Taipei. A few months later, Merrill Lynch alum and Taiwan native Kevin Tseng launched NAOS, a DeFi marketplace for loans backed by real-world assets. In the months since launching last December, NAOS has secured more than 2,500 corporate clients and $250 million in assets originating from the U.S., Mexico, India and Indonesia.      During the pandemic, around 2,000 special gold card employment visas were given out to expat tech entrepreneurs and developers to move to Taiwan, according to Hsu. It’s unclear how many were granted specifically to crypto developers or businesses. Hsu did not respond to a followup request for clarification.      “So you could say, perhaps about 500 to 1,000 blockchain and crypto related people here in Taiwan are from outside of Taiwan. A lot of them are from Silicon Valley,” Hsu said.      The rising influx of DeFi teams to Taiwan is a little surprising given the current lack of regulatory clarity for crypto businesses compared to other regional tech hubs like Singapore, and the fact that Taiwanese investors are not too bullish on cryptocurrencies.      In fact, after China’s financial regulators banned initial coin offerings (ICOs) and ordered cryptocurrency exchanges in mainland China to halt operations in 2017, Taiwan was slated to become a crypto hub. But the hype died down quickly, and despite Hsu’s own attempts at turning Taiwan into a crypto haven not much happened – until now.      “We’ve managed to attract a lot of blockchain and crypto talent. But now I think the question remains, are we able to keep them? Or are they going to move to somewhere else like Singapore, for better transparency of regulations or a more friendly environment?” Hsu said.    High hopes    After mainland China cracked down on any direct connection between local banking institutions and crypto entities back in 2017, Taiwan saw a rush of activity and inflows of money, said Alex Liu, chief executive officer of Taiwan’s largest cryptocurrency exchange MaiCoin.      “In terms of the degree to which the regulators and the banks allow retail participation in the crypto market, actually, Taiwan's much more permissive. So that's why in 2018 especially, a lot of [initial coin offering] teams would come to Taiwan for fundraising,” Liu said, adding that MaiCoin, which is similar to Coinbase, has been allowed to operate without interruptions since 2014.      According to Enlighten Law Group’s Tsai, Chinese crypto firms made the move to Taiwan because of its proximity to the mainland and the shared language. But when the bear market hit in 2018 through 2019, investors and companies suffered big losses, Tsai said.      “In this time, we saw a lot of blockchain companies withdraw from Taiwanese markets,” Tsai said.      It didn’t help that the average Taiwanese investor is risk-averse, according to Will Tseng.      “They are not that familiar with crypto. Even if they buy, they sell fast because they think it’s very risky,” Will Tseng said.      Cheng agreed, adding that, in Taiwan, there’s a lot of money locked up in savings. In 2020, Taiwan’s gross savings rate was 39.3%.      “The population is very, very conservative. They tend to think that crypto assets are gambling tools, and there are people that lost a lot of money on bitcoin during the 2018 downturn,” Cheng said.      Meanwhile, scams were running rampant during the ICO craze, and already-conservative Taiwanese investors felt cheated by the projects and tokens that were on the market, according to NAOS’ Kevin Tseng.      “I think the Taiwan society is just generally very cautious about anything blockchain related because during the ICO era there were just a lot of scam projects,” Kevin Tseng said.      According to Liu, there are currently around 550,000 registered users on MaiCoin. Liu estimates there are about 2 million crypto users in Taiwan, including MaiCoin and its competitors.      “As a percentage of the population it’s still under 10%. That's a relatively low penetration rate compared to South Korea, and even compared to our neighbor the Philippines,” Liu said.    A pandemic haven    In 2020, Kevin Tseng noticed a stream of DeFi projects trickling into Taiwan from other countries, but not for the reasons you’d think. The Taiwanese investors and regulators didn’t magically start embracing crypto, he said. For instance, NAOS does not serve Taiwanese users.      In fact, most DeFi platforms operating in Taiwan are outward-facing. Cheng says he has done “zero marketing” that targets the local Taiwanese consumer base.      “If you are somehow seen as a financial service, and you're marketing to the local population, then you have more questions to answer. But if you're just operating out of here on a decentralized protocol, then we just happen to be operating from here,” Cheng said.      Kevin Tseng believes the pandemic played a part in triggering the recent influx of DeFi teams.      “I think for those projects, Taiwan is sort of a silent place to be, where they can move in and have a high quality of life. So it's more like a relocation for them instead of coming into Taiwan because of the vibrant crypto ecosystem. We don't really have that yet,” Kevin Tseng said.      Until earlier this year, when cases spiked for the first time since the start of the pandemic, Taiwan was virtually undisturbed by COVID-19 and was lauded for its prompt and effective response to the crisis. In Taiwan, life continued as usual and that made it an attractive destination to lockdown-fatigued city dwellers from the western world.      Kevin Tseng added that Taiwan’s talented developers make it all the more attractive to projects looking to move in. In fact, earlier this year, Beijing-based bitcoin mining giant Bitmain was accused of illegally poaching engineering talent – 100 engineers to be exact– from Taiwan.      But just like local investors, interest from developers can also be sparse: talented Taiwanese engineers typically don’t want to go into blockchain, according to Kevin Tseng.      “I think they want to work for bigger corporations like the Microsofts, Googles or Apples of the world,” Kevin Tseng said.      But Hsu is certain the biggest deterrent to Taiwan becoming a regional crypto hub is its approach to regulation.    Regulations    In April, Taiwan’s Financial Supervisory Committee (FSC) announced the new AML regulations, including Hsu’s amendment for virtual assets, will come into effect on July 1, 2021. But Hsu and Tsai agree the regulations may be too restrictive.      Before the new regulations came into effect, Tsai said they might be heavily debated. For instance, crypto mining companies must also comply with the new AML regulations, Tsai said, but mining firms don’t feel they are providing a financial service.      “So probably there will still be some aggressive theories for a period of time. The government will try to promote the idea that we are now regulated, but I think that it’ll take at least three months to six months to really enforce the new regulations,” Tsai said.      Shubao Ex, Joyso DEX and Starbit have already ceased operations. According to Tsai, the three entities are small to medium-size exchanges, with Shubao Ex being the largest in terms of volume and having technology support from Huobi Global.      “In my opinion, since their trading volume is small there is little profit for them to maintain the operation of the exchanges. The compliance costs might be too high for them or they probably do not have enough time to build an AML compliance program,” Tsai said.      One reason for the skepticism about the new regulations is the existing rules for security token offerings (STO) under Taiwan’s securities exchange law, according to Will Tseng. The STO regulations were so restrictive that there was only one STO case built since the regulations came into effect in 2019, Will Tseng said.      “Only professional investors can participate in the subscription,” the regulations said, adding that the limit per investment cannot exceed 300,000 New Taiwan dollars (around US$10,900).      The regulations also dictate that if the amount of funds raised via an STO is above 30 million New Taiwan dollars (around $1 million), the issuer must apply for the regulatory sandbox experiments in accordance with ""Fintech Development and Innovation Experiment Regulations""      “It's very ridiculous. I think the government made a mistake with these regulations. The Taiwanese government is very afraid of making policies for risky assets. It doesn’t matter how big the business is, they just want to cut off the risk,” Will Tseng said.      Despite slow and cautious regulations and the lack of interest in adoption inside Taiwan, Cheng is thrilled to see new developers and projects make Taiwan their home. Meanwhile, Hsu is still optimistic about Taiwan’s future as a crypto hub. He also believes institutional acceptance of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin around the world will encourage more investments locally.      “With more crypto and other FinTech companies coming out, the government really needs to think about how to make this industry more tech-friendly. In other words, you should allow tech companies to enable financial services, not restrict them,” Hsu said.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/07/08/can-taiwan-become-asias-crypto-haven-not-yet,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e334abdf554c26784bae532bd0ac4fc696166845-2121x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The EU is responding to calls for tougher action fighting money laundering, according to reports.  The European Commission, the trading bloc's executive arm, is proposing an Anti-Money Laundering Authority (AMLA) to take ""decisions towards some of the riskiest cross-border financial sector obliged entities,"" according to EU documents Wednesday, the reports said.  Crypto-asset service providers would be obliged to collect and disclose data concerning originators and beneficiaries of transfers, something that is currently outside the scope of EU rules for financial services.  Until now, anti-money laundering regulation has been the remit of the EU's 27 member states, but the Commission says problems such as terrorist financing and organized crime should be addressed centrally.  Pressure for the EU to take firmer action on money laundering has mounted since the Danske Bank scandal of 2007-2015, in which €200 billion ($235 billion) of suspicious transactions flowed through an Estonian branch of the Danish bank.

Read more: USDC Stablecoin Could Soon Expand to 10 More Blockchains    Circle also debuted a savings product that could get bigger financial players into crypto markets. Lending market Compound launched a USDC product aimed at neobanks and fintech firms, offering 4% interest on USDC deposits. A similar product, albeit more consumer-focused, was launched by Coinbase shortly after.      “As we look at what we’re building,” Circle co-founder Jeremy Allaire said Thursday in an interview on CNBC, “we just see an incredible opportunity to grow, to grow rapidly and to grow around the world.”      Indeed, a company presentation on the SPAC deal listed an expected USDC circulation of $190 billion by 2023 – sevenfold growth from its current $26 billion.      “We’re investing heavily in product development and engineering,” said Allaire, as “blockchain finance becomes the backbone of the global financial system.”    Terms of the deal    Circle's deal with Concord is anticipated to close in Q4 2021, the firms said Thursday.      The deal’s backers lined up an additional $415 million of capital commitments from investors including Marshall Wace, Fidelity, ARK Investment Management’s Adage Capital and Third Point.      Circle's Allaire will remain CEO of the company; Concord Chairman Bob Diamond will join the board.      Concord is run by several former Wall Street veterans who have banded together in recent years to shop for possible acquisitions and other investments in the financial industry. Diamond, the former CEO of Barclays during the financial crisis, resigned from the bank in 2012 during the Libor scandal, where Barclays staff were allegedly involved in helping to manipulate global money-market rates.      Concord shares are up 6.2% in premarket trading, according to Nasdaq.      Concord went public on the New York Stock Exchange in December through a $240 million initial public offering, according to a press release at the time.

The study by behavioral finance firm Oxford Risk concludes that 21% of investors rate their knowledge as ""poor or non-existent"" even after owning crypto assets.  Of the 1,038 investors surveyed, 36% said that at the time they first bought crypto their knowledge was poor or non-existent.  The research also suggests that Britons are quite prudent in their crypto investments, with 81% saying they started with small amounts to see what happens.  Three-quarters (76%) have invested less than 5% of their total savings and 41% have invested less than 1%.  Research by the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority concluded that while awareness of crypto is increasing, understanding is declining. That was based on a figure of 71% of people being able to correctly identify the definition of cryptocurrency from a list of statements.  The Oxford Risk study was conducted May 21-23.

The banker said the PBOC is already taking measures against cryptos.      On Tuesday, the PBOC closed a Beijing-based company that provides software services for virtual currency transactions, reaffirming the central bank's stance that no businesses under its purview should engage in such transactions.      Fan also said the risk of assets outside a pegged value, namely bitcoin, is problematic.      “These currencies have themselves become speculation tools,” said Fan, who added they posed a risk to “financial security and social stability.”      The PBOC is developing a central bank digital currency, or digital yuan, which is said to pose its own risks to the dominance of the U.S. dollar as a global reserve currency.

According to a report by news outlet Leadership on Thursday, the member nations said bitcoin's decline in recent months was a reminder that cryptocurrencies are not safe-haven assets.    The comments came during a parliamentary meeting of the joint committees of the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAShttps://www.ecowas.int/member-states/) in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.    Several cryptocurrency experts and resource personnel were also present at the meeting, according to the report.      The region has had a mixed experience with the nascent asset class. At times crypto has helped the unbanked in the region, although earlier this year, Nigeria's central bank ordered institutions under its purview to block accounts tied up in crypto. It has since softened its stance.      ECOWAS also said that cryptocurrencies can be refused as payment without the necessary legal protections normally afforded to government-issued fiat.      Other risks include their volatile and speculative nature as well as susceptibility to theft.      The union also pointed to crypto's insecure liquidity in comparison to the $6.6 trillion foreign exchange market and the fact that 96% of cryptocurrencies is owned by only 2.5% of users.      CoinDesk was unable to determine where ECOWAS got its figures. Glassnode data show wallet addresses holding more than one bitcoin have been on the decline since the year began, while those holding less than one were increasing.

Tech giant International Business Machines and Heifer International, a global nonprofit that seeks to end poverty by promoting sustainable farming, will assist in the process, according to a press release on Wednesday.      Those purchasing cocoa through Heifer Honduras' Chocolate4All project will be able to trace the provenance of goods using IBM's Food Trust, a network that uses blockchain technology to connect and validate participants in supply chains.      The technology is designed to give buyers a way to reliably purchase beans through Copranil, one of the oldest coffee cooperatives in the western highlands of Honduras.    Read more: US Navy Commissions $1.5M Blockchain System for Tracking Critical Weaponry    In order to trace beans along a supply chain, users are given access to IBM's private blockchain, on which Food Trust is built. Users can then upload data onto the network. They can also access documents through the network. That is designed to ensure an equitable exchange of information.      Heifer first uploads the information about plants that are shipped to farmers. Post-harvest, farmers are required to tag and ship their beans to Copranil processors.      Additional data is then uploaded to the blockchain regarding the status of the beans, including how they were cleaned, dried and roasted under the framework of the Fair Trade coffee regulations. From there, corporate buyers can view all the information to understand the prices of the goods sold.      Heifer says small-scale coffee farmers operate at an average 46%-59% loss with farmers reaping less than 1% of the profits from a cup of coffee sold. The aim is to increase their profit margins, the companies say.      ""When the people drinking our coffee know where it comes from, the farmers in our cooperative benefit,"" said Copranil Vice President Jorge Lopez.
