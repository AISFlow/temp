Attackers come up with new techniques to attack or improve on existing ones. One of the most common significant risks in the digital assets industry is crypto phishing attacks. Fraudsters try to obtain user credentials by sending phony emails, visiting bogus websites, or both to steal confidential information. Unfortunately, due to significant investments and gaps in national legislation, intruders are increasingly targeting blockchain companies using fake cryptocurrency lists, ultimately leading to phishing cryptocurrency. If you want to know how to protect yourself from phishing emails, keep reading to find out the answer. In this article, we will discuss how to detect phishing attacks, how to protect yourself from phishing attacks, tools to prevent phishing attacks, and how to spot a Bitcoin scammer. What Are Crypto Phishing Attacks? In order to understand how to prevent phishing in an organization, you need to know what exactly is a crypto phishing attack. In such attacks, private crypto wallet keys, which are required to access funds within the wallet, are the target of scammers. The fraudsters try to obtain such keys by sending a phishing email that sounds genuine at first but, in reality, is a scam.

42374445,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvZVur,1655249295,"'Staked Ether' Becomes Focus of Crypto Stress, From Celsius to Three Arrows","A token known as ""staked ether"" has suddenly become a key focus for crypto traders trying to monitor extreme stress in digital-asset markets, as important players from the beleaguered lender Celsius to the hedge fund Three Arrows Capital and the industry heavyweight Sam Bankman-Fried's Alameda Research are dumping their holdings.  The key metric is the discount between the price of staked ether (stETH) – a token from the Lido Finance protocol that's supposed to trade at a price close to ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain – and the price of ether itself.  The discount shot to a record 8% on Monday, according to data by Dune Analytics.  The speculation, according to analysts, is that crypto market makers and lenders might be forced to dump their holdings of the stETH tokens to fund withdrawals and meet margin calls.  Staked ether was launched by decentralized-finance (DeFi) platform Lido Finance as a way to provide liquidity to traders who are ""staking"" their ether on Ethereum's Beacon Chain. It's all part of the process by which Ethereum is transitioning to a ""proof-of-stake"" blockchain. Without going into all the details, participants in the system have to commit to locking up their tokens for a period of time to help process transactions; in return they receive crypto rewards. But in the meantime, they can take stETH tokens and continue to trade.  Lido dominates the Ethereum staking ecosystem, with about one-third of all staked ether deposits. In May, Goldman Sachs wrote that such a concentration of deposits “can theoretically increase systemic risk” because of Lido’s interconnections to crypto markets.  Big holders dump  Celsius, a crypto lender that has come under scrutiny since it froze withdrawals last weekend, citing ""extreme market conditions,"" holds 409,260 stETH tokens, worth about $470 million at current prices, according to data provided by Ape Board, a portfolio tracker from the blockchain analysis firm Nansen.  Johnny Louey and Andy Hoo, analysts at Huobi Research Institute, the research arm of the Huobi crypto exchange, wrote in a note Tuesday that Celsius took a loss of almost $71 million earlier from staking stETH on Stakehound because Stakehound misplaced the keys.  Worried Celsius users started a rapid wave of redemptions at a rate of around 50,000 ETH per week, the report added, and the platform was scrambling for liquidity.  “What Celsius can do is sell its stETH in order to buy ETH on the market to satisfy client requests,” Noelle Acheson, head of market insights at crypto market maker Genesis, told CoinDesk. (Genesis and CoinDesk are both owned by Digital Currency Group.)  The stETH discount initially opened up last month, when crypto markets were roiled by the collapse of the Terra blockchain network and its stablecoin UST. Since then, stETH has mostly traded at a discount of 2-3%, with a spike to 5% on May 12 when UST fell into a death spiral.  The market capitalization of stETH has dropped to $4 billion from about $10 billion at the start of May, driven by holders who are fleeing staking platforms as ether’s price crashes.  Three Arrows Capital, a Singapore-based trading and investing firm that was one of the biggest investors in the Terra blockchain, withdrew nearly $400 million of stETH and ETH from the Curve protocol in May, Andrew Thurman, a Nansen analyst, told CoinDesk.  Three Arrows Capital, often shorthanded as 3AC, “has caught the attention of the on-chain community in recent weeks with how they’ve been managing their stETH position,"" Thurman said.  Data from Nansen shows that a wallet attributed to 3AC withdrew 80,000 stETH from decentralized lending protocol Aave Tuesday and converted 38,900 stETH (some $45 million) in two transactions at an 5.6-5.9% discount rate for ether.  That came after rumors on crypto Twitter that the investment firm may be facing financial difficulties.  Representatives of 3AC didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.  Last week, another big-name trading firm, Alameda – which is closely connected to Sam Bankman-Fried, founder and CEO of crypto exchange FTX – dumped 50,615 stETH, worth about $88 million at the time, according to a tweet from Hsaka, a popular crypto trader.  Illiquidity frenzy  Another reason for the discount is the relative illiquidity of staked ether, Acheson said.  Investors are fleeing risky assets such as cryptocurrencies as financial markets around the world decline in response to central banks raising interest rates to fight inflation. That is squeezing crypto platforms to meet customer redemptions. At the same time, investors now prefer to hold assets that are more liquid.  The daily trading volume of stETH is in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, compared with ETH’s daily volume in the billions, making the less-liquid asset’s price more sensitive to selling pressure. When a big player needs to sell its holdings, it may find fewer buyers, pushing down the price of stETH.  “In the short term, stETH will face tremendous selling pressure,"" Huobi Research Institute’s report concluded. ""Turbulence is expected in the near future.”",NEGATIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/06/14/staked-ether-becomes-focus-of-crypto-stress-from-celsius-to-three-arrows,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/128f15ff4fa4e9ccf2eb2dba9f754e78b47265e0-5120x3840.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Mostly, investors have been rushing to get out of the market before the crash takes more of their funds. What this has led to has been a significant increase in the number of cryptocurrencies that are flowing to exchanges. Most notably have been Bitcoin and Ethereum, whose daily exchange inflows have touched billions of dollars. Billions In Crypto To Exchanges The data for the last 24 hours shows that the amount of funds that are being transferred into centralized exchanges is up over the last week. Instead of the sub-$1 billion figures that have usually been recorded, the volume has ramped up significantly. Glassnode reports that more than $3 billion in Bitcoin had moved into exchanges over the last 24 hours. In total, there was $3.2 billion worth of BTC recorded to have flowed into exchanges, with $3.3 billion flowing out, leading to a negative net flow of -$103.5 million.

42393971,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brwbJv,1655246948,Consensus 2022 Was the Crypto Bull Market's Goodbye Party,"The first flurries of crypto winter fell before Consensus 2022.  Just a few weeks before 20,000 people descended on Austin, Texas, for CoinDesk’s annual festival, the terraUSD (UST) stablecoin collapsed, wiping over $80 billion from the total crypto market cap and triggering a wave of sell-offs. Coinbase slammed the brakes on hiring and announced it would be rescinding already-accepted job offers – despite earlier promises the Nasdaq-listed exchange would do no such thing.  Despite the growing chill in the markets – or perhaps because of them – Consensus was a blowout.  For four days, conference-goers ate, drank and were merry. They traversed the city on scooters in the Texas heat, bouncing between networking sessions and hackathons in various hotels to sessions in the Austin Convention Center (ACC), featuring some of the biggest names in crypto and culture including whistleblower Edward Snowden, FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried and rapper 2 Chainz.  Attendees eagerly collected DESK, CoinDesk’s social token, and used it to pay for tacos and barbecue from food trucks or Consensus-branded merchandise. At night, they swapped DESK for drink tokens at Consensus-affiliated after-parties, like the one headlined by electronic music duo Disclosure.  Consensus-adjacent events including the Helium House ATX, sponsored by the rapidly-expanding Helium protocol, also thrived. Catered dinners and parties sponsored by companies such as Binance drew large crowds, and industry insiders rubbed elbows with regulators and investors at invite-only events, like lobbying group Coin Center’s annual dinner.  In hindsight, Coin Center’s (seed oil-free, naturally) dinner seems more akin to a Last Supper, and its theme – inspired by the “This is Fine” meme, in which a dog in a tiny hat sips coffee in a burning room – feels prescient.  On Sunday morning, Consensus 2022 wrapped up with a well-attended interview between CoinDesk’s Emily Parker and Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao. Zhao’s proclamations of having a “healthy war chest” to weather the coming crypto winter were met with cheers from the audience.  Later that evening, crypto lending service Celsius halted its withdrawals and other products, sending the markets into a panic. On Monday, the price of bitcoin (BTC) plummeted, going as low as $20,834 in the early hours of Tuesday morning. Later on Tuesday, Coinbase announced mass layoffs, slashing nearly 20% of its workforce and leaving approximately 1,100 people without jobs.  As the flurries of crypto winter turned into a blizzard, Consensus offered attendees a brief shelter from the storm, a warm hearth to gather around and meet friends, tell stories and plan for the future.  The WAGMI (“we’re all going to make it”) optimism of the bull market is fading fast, but, hey – at least we had fun in Austin.  The DESK Piranhas return  CoinDesk’s social token, DESK, made its debut as a full-fledged blockchain token at this year’s Consensus.  The beta version used at last year’s virtual Consensus – which could be obtained by visiting various sessions and exchanged for CoinDesk merch and non-fungible tokens (NFT) – was enormously popular, and developed a fanbase that named themselves “Piranhas” for their insatiable hunger for DESK.  To appease the Piranhas in Austin, CoinDesk made DESK bigger than ever, bringing it from the experimental environment of Ethereum’s testnet to Polygon, a live blockchain, and offering in-person events to teach attendees how to redeem and use their DESK.  DESK could be obtained by scanning QR codes posted around the conference, or completing quests given on the DESK Discord server, such as taking selfies in various places or shooting hoops at the Sport Court.  Over 20% of Consensus attendees used DESK during the festival, collectively spending approximately 200,000 tokens on food, drinks and merch. Dozens of helpful volunteers in bright yellow DESK T-shirts swarmed the convention center, offering help to confused attendees.  It wasn’t all sunshine and rainbows, though: Some would-be DESK Piranhas got greedy, tearing down QR code stickers from signs in an attempt to redeem more than their share and prevent others from getting DESK. Scammers printed fake “DESK multiplier” QR codes and stuck them to DESK posters, hoping to scam DESK users out of the contents of their wallets.  Turns out that even if it’s just DESK, the old crypto adage of “Do Your Own Research” still applies.  Spectacles abound  Consensus has always been an occasion for gimmicky spectacle – the 2018 event, which attracted roughly 8,000 attendees, famously featured several Lamborghinis that were parked out front of the conference.  In Austin, however, the Lambos were absent, replaced with even more expensive McLarens. One, wrapped in a pattern of hundreds of overlapping DOGE Shiba inu faces, attracted a large crowd when its owner, crypto influencer Julia Love, parked it in front of the Hilton.  The demo of “Crypto: the Musical” on June 10 was also a spectacle. The brainchild of Amanda Cassatt, CEO of crypto marketing firm Serotonin, the would-be Broadway show aims to tell the story of “one woman’s journey fleeing the corporate world to join a crypto startup.”  The aspiring theatrical project’s creative team (who also produced “Ratatouille: the TikTok Musical”) and performers serenaded the audience with two songs from the show, including one about the Howey Test – a framework created by the U.S. Supreme Court to determine whether transactions qualify as securities.  Consensus 2022 also featured the first MetaGala, a black-tie event where crypto investors, influencers and artists came together to drink (cocktails had themed names, such as the Metarita, the Meta Mule and the Meta Spritz), dance and raise money for several charities.  Crypto will keep Austin weird  Though this year’s Consensus was the first held in Austin after years in New York or virtually because of COVID-19, the Texas capital turned out to be a perfect fit for the festival.  The spirit of Austin meshed well with crypto, and Consensus attendees embraced the entertainment and culture the city had to offer.  When they weren’t buying food with DESK, attendees ate at famous local restaurants including the Texas Chili Parlor and Franklin’s Barbecue, they went to drag queen brunches on 4th Street, and they cooled off at Barton Springs – a spring-fed pool in Zilker Park beloved by locals for its notoriously cold water.  On the final day of the conference, Austin Mayor Steve Adler joined CoinDesk Chief Content Officer Michael Casey to announce that Consensus will return to his city next year, although, to beat the 100-degree heat, it will be moved from June to late April.  Though Austin was sweltering, Consensus-goers may miss the Texas heat after returning home to headlines about layoffs, price slumps and a once-highflying lender’s potential insolvency.  Consensus was a respite from the cold – and, hopefully for many, a fortification. Now it’s over. Crypto winter is here.

Panic ensued as people interpreted this as the stablecoin trading below the peg. Since USD was falling very steeply at the time, the prospect of a Tether crash seemed likely. However, the former company has promised savers $1 for every coin they give back to the company, regardless of the current market value. Tether has only allowed direct withdrawals of a minimum of $100,000 per request and charges a 0.1% fee on each redemption. Any coin holder that possesses less than the minimum can only convert their assets into dollars by selling them to other investors.

It is where the crypto prices plummet by over 20%, which encourages sales. For anybody who is planning to launch an ICO - yes, price matters! However, the growing number of ICOs makes it challenging for a start-up to flourish unless it promises to be different. In particular, the land of ICOs has more than 5700 ICOs, which displays the competitiveness required to pierce through the realm and come out conquering the rest. What is an ICO? An Initial Coin Offering (ICO) is a significant way to raise funds for a cryptocurrency project. It works by getting interested investors to buy into an initial coin offering to receive a new crypto token issued by the company. In a nutshell, the sea of ICOs binds no one on any set rules. However, with the fierce competition, time and volatility in the market is an illusion, the future value of tokens is also not supported by anything but demand. Could Launching ICOs During a Bear Market Work? The cryptocurrency market got wiped off billions of dollars of value in the last few weeks.

OpenSea created the first version of the protocol, which could lower gas fees by 35% for transactions, the blog read. Furthermore, based on last year&apos;s data, the switch to Seaport could save users $460M in the next year, as well as exempt new users from paying an account initialization fee.

The source said the SEC had sent a letter to a major crypto exchange asking about the kinds of protections it has in place against insider trading. The inquiry is meant to cover additional exchanges as well, according to the source.  The letter was sent after the collapse last month of Terra’s UST stablecoin and the associated LUNA token, according to the report.  The SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Fox News report.

42415390,U2msve444uc2I0ChHDV37N,1655239643,Market Wrap: BTC Tumbles Further Ahead of Fed Meeting; Extreme Fear Among Traders,"The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization dropped further on Tuesday as crypto industry layoffs widened and traders fretted over a likely steeper-than-expected rate hike by the U.S. central bank.  Down for the eighth consecutive day, bitcoin regained little strength after falling to a 30-month low of $20,834.50 on Monday night but was still down over 5% over the past 24 hours.  The 15% price drop at the start of the week was the biggest since the crash prompted by COVID-19 on March 12, 2020.  Not just bitcoin, but cryptocurrencies of all market cap sizes have suffered in the current sell-off, tracking steep declines in stocks, as Arcane Research noted in a report Tuesday.  “We're coming off of about a decade of monetary stimulus and money supply has grown rapidly, and for the first time market participants are getting the punch bowl taken away from them,” said Fundstrat Global Advisors head of digital asset strategy Sean Farrell on CoinDesk TV. “I think we're still going to need to see inflation start to roll over before we can be confident in any run to the upside and relief to the upside.”  An article in The Wall Street Journal on Monday hinted at a 75 basis point rate hike by the Fed at the conclusion of its two-day, closed-door meeting Wednesday.  This leaves traders fearing monetary tightening throughout the year with no break, as Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic suggested earlier this month, temporarily buoying crypto markets. Economists at Goldman Sachs (GS) now are forecasting 75 basis point rate hikes for both June and July, followed by a 50 basis point increase in September plus a 25 basis point hike in November and in December.  “Investors should be braced for volatility and sticky correlations at least in the coming days,” Arcane researchers wrote.  As a result, the bitcoin Fear and Greed Index reached 8, signaling extreme fear. While the market has been in extreme fear territory for the 56th consecutive month, this level hasn't been seen since March 2020.  Latest prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $22185, −4.99%    ●Ether (ETH): $1206, −3.12%    ●S&P 500 daily close: 3735, −0.38%    ●Gold: $1809 per troy ounce, −1.04%    ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 3.48%     Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time.

Celcius's CEL token jumps 8-fold in intraday spike  By Tracy Wang  The beleaguered crypto lending platform Celsius’s CEL token jumped eight-fold to an intraday high of $2.57 from 30 cents, according to data from FTX, before falling back to about 54 cents. That's still up from 35 cents prior to a recent crash when Celsius halted withdrawals on June 12, citing ""extreme market conditions.""  According to exchange data, it appears the latest price jump stemmed from a big spot buyer on crypto exchange FTX.  A trader who spoke with CoinDesk says the price action indicated a short squeeze, as shorting Celsius’s token had become an “overcrowded trade.” A ""short"" position is when traders bet on a token's price to fall.  A short squeeze occurs when the price of a token moves sharply higher, prompting traders who bet against it – often with borrowed money or tokens – to buy it back or ""cover"" the position, to avoid greater losses.  Questions surrounding Celsius's financial health have been making waves in cryptocurrency markets.  Altcoin roundup  ETH underperformance echoes ‘Crypto Winter’: The largest altcoin, ether (ETH), is underperforming bitcoin (BTC), just as it did during the downturn in crypto markets in 2018, investment bank Morgan Stanley (MS) said in a report Monday. “When the ETH/BTC relative cross falls, it is a sign that the broader crypto enthusiasm is waning” as money is being pulled out of the more volatile alternative coins, according to the note. The analysts added that this time around it’s largely institutional investors driving sales. ETH has dropped about 75% from its November peak, and changed hands at $1,215. Read more here.  Shorts and longs liquidated: Crypto-tracked futures lost over $1 billion in a day as major cryptocurrencies declined by an average of over 15%, data shows.

The move-to-earn app Stepn’s GMT futures saw $6.6 million in losses. Liquidations happen when a trader fails to have sufficient funds to keep a leveraged position open so the trade is forced to close. Read more here.  OpenSea change: The leading non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace OpenSea is revamping its back end and moving from the Wyvern protocol to its self-developed Seaport protocol. The company estimates the switch will save users $460 million in the next year by lowering transaction costs on the platform. The move will also allow OpenSea to eliminate initiation fees, let users make offers on entire collections and make its wallet signatures easier to read and understand, the firm said.

42415384,U2msve444uc2I0ChHDV2qD,1655233926,SEC Chair Gensler Suggests Lummis-Gillibrand Bill May ‘Undermine’ Market Protections,"A bill intended to specify the rules and roles for crypto regulation could inadvertently ""undermine"" other market protections, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler said Tuesday.  Speaking at The Wall Street Journal's CFO Network Summit, Gensler suggested many crypto companies are already engaging in behaviors overseen by his agency, pointing to companies that offer yield for staking as one example.  Asked about a bill introduced by U.S. senators Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) last week, Gensler said he would rather speak to the lawmakers first, but that from his agency's point of view, ""What we wanted to do is to continue to protect"" the role his agency plays in overseeing how companies can raise money from the general public.  ""Frankly, if I can turn away from the legislation, we don't want to undermine the protections we have in a $100 trillion capital market. You don't want our current stock exchanges, our current mutual funds, our current public companies [to] sort of inadvertently by a stroke of a pen say 'you know what, I want to be noncompliant as well, I want to be outside of the regime' that I think has been quite a benefit to investors and economic growth over the last 90 years,"" Gensler said.  The bill, as set out, would assign responsibility for different parts of the crypto market to different agencies, as well as address a range of other issues, such as creating a de minimus tax exemption for small crypto transactions.  His counterpart at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), Rostin Behnam, previously said the bill ""does a very good job.""  The CFTC chief has long advocated for his agency to have greater spot market oversight of crypto, citing the volume of transactions conducted in bitcoin and ether, the two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. Both of these cryptocurrencies are commonly accepted as commodities, rather than securities that the SEC would oversee.  Gensler, in his comments Tuesday, said most crypto exchanges list hundreds of tokens, and ""it's highly unlikely that all of them, 100% are not securities.""  Gillibrand, speaking on CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program last week, said the bill is ""clarifying the roles"" that the SEC and CFTC have in overseeing crypto, and that the lawmakers had worked with SEC staff in creating the legislation.  It seems unlikely that the bill will pass this year. However, Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) suggested at CoinDesk's Consensus 2022 that legislation addressing stablecoins specifically may become law before 2023.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | MARKET | REGULATION,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/06/14/sec-chair-gensler-suggests-lummis-gillibrand-bill-may-undermine-market-protections,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7ee787fd96a01c6841e8c4a078a2f284f134f2b7-2896x2172.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin NUPL Indicator Assumes Negative Values For First Time Since 2020 As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the NUPL metric has declined below zero, which could be a sign that the crypto may be approaching a bottom. The Bitcoin &apos;net unrealized profit and loss&apos; (NUPL) is an indicator that&apos;s defined as the difference between the market cap and the realized cap, divided by the market cap. In simpler terms, what this metric tells us is whether the overall market is currently holding an unrealized profit or a loss. When the NUPL&apos;s value is greater than zero, it means the investors as a whole are in a state of profit at the moment. On the other hand, values of the metric less than zero imply the Bitcoin market as a whole is now holding an unrealized loss. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the BTC NUPL over the last few years: The value of the indicator seems to have plunged down recently | Source: CryptoQuant As you can see in the above graph, the Bitcoin NUPL has sharply decreased in value over the past couple of days as the price of the crypto has observed a crash.

He also said that it&apos;s also likely for it to fall as low as $3,000 if BTC holders keep selling off their holdings. If #Bitcoin can collapse by 70% from $69,000 to under $21,000, it can just as easily fall another 70% down to $6,000. Given the excessive leverage in #crypto, imagine the forced sales that would take place during a sell-off of this magnitude. $3,000 is a more likely price target. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) June 14, 2022 The tweet from Peter Schiff on BTC has come in the wake of mass firings by crypto companies. Popular crypto exchanges like Coinbase have laid off 18% of their workforce. This is most likely just the beginning of a wave of layoffs that will reverberate throughout the crypto community and beyond. Many hodlers may, therefore, be compelled to sell their Bitcoin as a result of their inability to find work. Bitcoin&apos;s price can plummet as much as 70% from $69K to around $21K, and if that happens, it might go even further down to $6K. Picture the compelled sales that would occur in the event of such a large sell-off due to the high leverage in bitcoin. A price objective of $3K seems more likely.

OpenSea says the switch could significantly reduce transaction costs on the platform, lowering ""gas"" costs by “about 35% based on last year’s data,” according to the blog post. The company estimates the switch will save users $460 million in the next year.  “Seaport is a game changer, it’s open source, inherently decentralized and a modern foundation that will help us (and any teams using it) build and release new features more quickly,” OpenSea said in the post.  OpenSea first announced it would eventually be building on top of Seaport at the end of May. While OpenSea created the first version of Seaport, it said the protocol is open source and meant to be used by all builders, creators and collectors of NFTs.  Sellers on the platform will have to pay a one-time fee per collection to sell NFTs on the platform using the new protocol.  In addition to lowering gas costs, moving to Seaport will allow OpenSea to eliminate initiation fees, let users make offers on entire collections and make its wallet signatures “easier to read and understand.”  Improving signature clarity is presumably a security measure, meant to quell the rise of phishing scams that have stolen millions of dollars of NFTs in the past year.

But in the hour after the spike, the price of CEL fell back and was trading at about 54 cents as of press time. According to data from CoinMarketCap, that price put the market capitalization of CEL at approximately $125 million.  That's still up from 35 cents prior to a recent crash when Celsius halted withdrawals on Sunday, June 12, citing ""extreme market conditions.""  In response to the news, Celsius’s CEL token plummeted to 18 cents from 35 cents Sunday evening, a decline of 48%.  According to exchange data, it appears the latest price jump was brought on by a big spot buyer on crypto exchange FTX.  A trader who spoke with CoinDesk says the price action was indicative of a short squeeze, as shorting Celsius’s token had become an “overcrowded trade.” A ""short"" position is when traders bet on a token's price to fall.  A short squeeze occurs when the price of a token moves sharply higher, prompting traders who bet against it – often with borrowed money or tokens – to buy it back or ""cover"" the position, to avoid greater losses.  Questions surrounding Celsius's financial health have been making waves in cryptocurrency markets.  On Tuesday morning, Celsius appears to have paid off $28 million of its outstanding loan on Maker, a decentralized finance protocol that lends out DAI, a stablecoin.

However, GMT appears to be cooling off after cratering below $0.86. Past Performance of STEPN The STEPN coin price is defying gravity at spot rates. Still, the STEPN crypto coin is under pressure and aligning along the lower BB. GMT crypto is one of the top performers, adding 16 percent against the USDT in the last trading day alone. GMT surged an average of 16 percent during this time against the BTC and ETH. STEPN Technical Analysis The crypto market is under pressure, and the STEPN coin is technically fragile. While it is up 16 percent, it is banding along the lower BB in a bear breakout below $0.86. This reaction level flashes with May 2022 lows. Based on the development in the daily chart, aggressive sellers may sell on every pullback, targeting $0.30 in the short term. However, a recovery above $0.86 would pour cold water on bears and allow prices to recover after two months of steady lower lows. What to Expect from the GMT coin? Sellers are in the driving seat as per the GMT technical analysis. A recovery from spot rates, forcing prices above the middle BB, would be refreshing.

If in place, the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) framework could facilitate the implementation of sanctions against Russia that also apply to crypto, McGuinness said during her opening remarks at the economics committee structured dialogue on Tuesday.  ""Of course, sanctions implementation could be facilitated if our framework on crypto was in place, and if all crypto-asset service providers were regulated entities and subject to effective supervision in the European Union,"" McGuinness said.  McGuinness cited three recent events as reasons for hastening the legislation: the war in Ukraine, the crash of cryptocurrency issuer Terra and the news that crypto-lender Celsius was suspending withdrawals.  “What I want and what I can tell you that MiCA rules will be the right tool to address the concerns on consumer protection, market integrity and financial stability. This is something that is so urgent given recent developments,” McGuinness said.  The MiCA framework seeks to regulate the digital asset space at the EU level, setting up licensing requirements for crypto-asset service providers and cryptocurrency issuers that would apply for all 27 member nations. Introduced in 2020, the framework has been moving through the EU's complex legislative process, and not without some contention over the environmental impact of cryptocurrencies and privacy.  The war in Ukraine and the implementation of strict financial sanctions on Russia have led to concerns over the use of cryptocurrencies to evade sanctions. EU leaders have been calling for the expedition of MiCA, arguing it would help fight sanction evasion.  On Tuesday, EU lawmakers are meeting in Brussels to discuss the framework in one of the last trilogue sessions before the rules are finalized. Lawmakers could reach an agreement on the file by the end of the month.

A a 75 basis point (0.75 percentage point) hike is suddenly seen as all but certain after the Wall Street Journal reported that officials were considering a bigger increase than previously signaled.  The two-day closed-door meeting of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee that started Tuesday and runs through Wednesday is the Fed's third this year. The U.S. central bank has been raising its benchmark interest rate in an effort to tamp down fast-rising inflation, and by extension consumer prices.  Up until last week, economists predicted a 50 basis point rate increase, as happened in May. But a U.S. government report Friday showed the consumer price index, which tracks inflation, rose to a new high of 8.6% instead of an expected slowdown. Now, the central bank is entertaining the possibility of accelerating its rate hikes, according to the Wall Street Journal.  As a result, Goldman Sachs (GS) changed its forecast to 75 basis points for the next rate increase. Chief Economist Jan Hatzius said that ""our best guess is therefore that the [WSJ] article is a hint from the Fed leadership that a 75bp rate hike is coming.”  Similarly, the CME FedWatch Tool, which uses 30-day Fed Funds futures data, shows traders see a 94% chance of a 75 basis point hike, compared with 35% just one day ago.  The prospect of a bigger rate hike has added to price pressures in the crypto market, when bitcoin (BTC) plunged below $25,000 to a 30-month low on Monday.

I’m Bradley Keoun, here to take you through the latest in crypto markets, news and insights. (Lyllah Ledesma is off.)  Price point: Bitcoin heads for longest daily losing streak since mid-2016, and $1 billion of trading positions get liquidated (""rekt"" in crypto-speak).  Market Moves: The Fed starts its two-day closed-door meeting, and Wall Street analysts are growing increasingly negative; Bybit releases its ""first-ever Bear Market Guide for traders.""  Price point  Bitcoin (BTC) slid for an eighth straight day, its longest losing streak since January 2016, as U.S. stocks joined cryptocurrencies in a bear market.  Some $1 billion of cryptocurrency futures contracts and derivatives were liquidated due to margin calls over just 24 hours.  The big U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase disclosed plans to lay off some 1,100 employees, or roughly 18% of its workforce, as part of a cost-cutting plan. Analysts for the Wall Street firm JPMorgan cut Coinbase's stock rating to neutral, and the shares slumped.  ""This is very bad, especially for those holding their coins there, but also for the industry as a whole,"" wrote Mati Greenspan, founder of the cryptocurrency and foreign-exchange analysis firm Quantum Economics, wrote Monday in a newsletter. ""There isn't much optimism right now. It's been a very brutal bear market.""  European shares traded lower on Tuesday, but U.S. stock futures appeared to be bouncing prior to the open of trading in New York. Gold was down 0.5% to $1,823 an ounce; crude oil rose 1% to $122 a barrel.  The 10-year U.S. Treasury bond yield was down a 0.06 percentage point to 3.31%.  Read More: Morgan Stanley Says Ether Underperformance Echoes Crypto Downturn of 2018     Market moves  The Federal Reserve's campaign to tighten monetary conditions – to help contain inflation running at its fastest in four decades – has put extreme pressure on assets across the board, from cryptocurrencies to stocks and bonds.  The U.S. central bank starts a two-day closed-door meeting on Tuesday, and traders are speculating over its likely decision, to be announced Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET.  Fed officials had telegraphed the likelihood of a 0.5 percentage point increase, but now some analysts are warning that a hike of 0.75 percentage point or even a full percentage point might be in the cards.  The ""S-word"" (stagflation) is on the lips of investors: ""We believe we're moving toward an environment of persistent high inflation coupled with weak real growth. In other words, stagflation,"" Kyle Delaney, president of the giant hedge fund Bridgewater, wrote in a communiqué to investors.  Fitch, the bond-rating service, cut its estimate of global gross domestic product growth in 2022 by 0.6 percentage point to 2.9%. ""Global inflation pressures continue to intensify, with increasingly adverse implications for the growth outlook,"" wrote Brian Coulton, Fitch's chief economist.  Underscoring the theme du jour, the crypto exchange Bybit unveiled its ""first-ever Bear Market Guide for traders.""  ""Featuring a contemporary design that draws inspiration from popular culture, the guide shares a pool of resources that can help investors put the bear market situation into perspective,"" Bybit said in a press release from Seychelles.  In the current economic environment, what else is there for a trader to do?     Latest headlines  Morgan Stanley Says Ether Underperformance Echoes Crypto Downturn of 2018 Expectations of higher Fed interest rates are weighing on crypto prices, the bank's analysts said.

42423131,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2WXLh,1655220780,"Gaming DAO Merit Circle, YGG ‘Terminate Relationship’","Two of the largest names in the play-to-earn scholarship space have decided to part ways after seven months.  Members of Merit Circle voted to terminate their relationship with Yield Guild Games (YGG), buying out the guild's 175,000 USDC ($175,000) investment in the play-to-earn gaming decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) for 1.75 million USDC.  YGG and Merit Circle offer play-to-earn gamers so-called scholarships. Gamers, almost always in developing countries, borrow the non-fungible token (NFT) that serves as the entrance fee for the game. As part of the deal, the gamers remit yield back to the NFT’s owners as they play.  “Collaboratively, Merit Circle Ltd and Yield Guild Games came to an agreement,” YGG wrote in a Medium post. “The proposed solution terminates the formal relationship between the Merit Circle DAO and Yield Guild Games. This space would not be where it is today without Yield Guild Games, and not without the Merit Circle DAO.”  In May, the two play-to-earn scholarship giants were caught in a governance strife as members of the Merit Circle DAO said YGG was not adding enough value as an investor and proposed ""refunding"" the investment. For its part, YGG said the investment, which closed last October, never required anything more than a capital infusion.  As community members pointed out in May, there’s no legal mechanism to ""refund"" an investor's contribution. It would need to be bought out at a mutually agreeable price.  The entire crypto gaming industry and related play-to-earn scholarship DAOs have faced strong headwinds during the last quarter as earnings on games like Axie Infinity drop.  Axie Infinity’s AXS token is currently trading for $14.33, down 33% during the last month, according to CoinGecko. It began the year just shy of $100. Meanwhile, YGG’s token is currently trading at $0.40, down 38% month on month, while Merit Circle is trading at $0.80.",NEGATIVE,AXS | USDC,AXS | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TRADING | USDC,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/06/14/gaming-dao-merit-circle-ygg-terminate-relationship,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/39aa01385c97a5e57426d51464c876d3bc8958a6-720x406.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The confident fall wave from November 2021 does not give any hope for a change in the trend so far. Source: https://www.tradingview.com/x/6FWEQQGv/ LINK trading volumes during the fall were lower than during the active price growth in 2020-2021. Completion of the global LINK cryptocurrency correction can be in the range of $4. It was in this range that sellers restrained buyers&apos; pressure during the year. It was back in 2019. We believe that this range can stop the strong trend of buyers and complete the global correction of the LINK market. So if you&apos;re looking for a place to buy LINK for long-term investment - the $4 range is a great choice. The main question - how exactly will the LINK price get to this range? Looking at the dynamics of the LINK fall in recent weeks, there is a high probability of a fall with deep price rebounds. For example, now buyers may well realize a price rebound of up to $8.7 in a few weeks. The final target of such a rebound is $14.6. Above this mark, we do not expect the LINK price.

""We don’t expect to receive a margin call, and the company has plenty of additional collateral should we need to post more,"" Saylor told the Wall Street Journal overnight.  Saylor and MicroStrategy have previously detailed their holdings of 129,218 bitcoins, with roughly 95,000 of that amount unencumbered. A bitcoin price of about $21,000 could theoretically have the company's lenders demanding more bitcoin be pledged as collateral. The MicroStrategy chief has further noted that it would take a bitcoin price of about $3,500 before the company might run out of bitcoin collateral.  “When MicroStrategy adopted a Bitcoin Strategy, it anticipated volatility and structured its balance sheet so that it could continue to #HODL through adversity,” Saylor tweeted this morning.  BTIG equity research analyst Mark Palmer ran the numbers himself and came to a similar conclusion. “The reality is that 95,643 of the 129,218 bitcoins held by MSTR are unencumbered and available to the company to post as additional collateral to avoid or address a margin call,” he wrote.  He describes as ""clearly incorrect"" the rumors that MicroStrategy might be selling any of its bitcoin.

Because of this new pricing, BTC lost 16.54% of its value in less than a day- almost $5,000 in value. Although being the largest and most famous cryptocurrency, Bitcoin is notorious for its huge climbs and equally dramatic declines. For example, BTC skyrocketed to an all-time high of over $69,000 in November 2021, then plummeted to just under $30,000 by the start of 2022.

It measures the computational drive for all transaction verification and block additions to the network. Hence, the Bitcoin hash rate represents the number of people involved in BTC mining. As the number of miners increases, the hash rate will also increase. This results in maintaining the security and stability of the Bitcoin ecosystem. Many investors will consider hash rates before engaging in any project. Before now, the BTC price and hash rate have maintained a direct proportionality relation. This is because there are always more transactions with the buying and selling BTC when the price is up. With such a price surge, there will be more mining activities to mint more tokens to balance the liquidity.

The only relatively high volume jumps were recorded during the trading week on 9 May. Further reduction of the price occurs without the special efforts of sellers. The AXS price has come very close to the important level of $11. This mark stopped the AXS price in April 2021. This is the first level on the AXS chart, where there was some struggle and where buyers can become more active.

42423135,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2WXVh,1655207063,JPMorgan Cuts Coinbase to Neutral With $68 Price Target; Shares Slump,"The extreme decline in cryptocurrency markets in the second quarter of this year combined with Coinbase’s (COIN) ramp-up in investment, means it will be challenging for the exchange to generate a profit in the near term, JPMorgan said in a report Tuesday.  The bank cut its rating on the stock to neutral from overweight and slashed its price target to $68 from $171.  Since the company generates a large part of its revenue from the value of crypto token prices - from trading, staking and custody - and much of the rest based on sentiment, the recent downturn is likely to have a “material negative impact on Coinbase revenue,” the report says.  JPMorgan estimates that trading volumes on Coinbase have fallen more than 30% in the second quarter of this year, following a 40% decline in the first.  Coinbase has significantly increased the pace of investment in recent quarters, hiring 3,200 staff over the last year, with 1,200 hired in the first quarter alone, the note says. This is a huge amount of recruitment for the exchange, which now has around 5,000 employees, according to the note.  However, Coinbase had later paused recruitment and rescinded some job offers following the recent market downturn, as reported. The hiring freeze should stop expense growth from mid-May, JPM noted.  Coinbase may need to do more than just implement a hiring freeze and might have to reduce expense levels to keep EBITDA losses within its $500 million guidance cap for 2022, the report says.  Against this backdrop of a more difficult macro environment, the bank notes that rival exchange FTX has overtaken Coinbase in terms of crypto activity in May and has continued to outpace Coinbase in June.  Coinbase shares fell close to 6% in premarket trading to $49.09.

As is the case with a developer from Tomsk, named Nikolai Muravyov. The young man experienced an instance of severe trauma, which not only didn&apos;t break his spirit but also helped him find a way to help many people who face mobility-related problems. Nikolay Muravyov explained to our editorial staff how he managed to create a project aimed at improving rehabilitation after strokes. How did the idea of VR GO come about? Life itself pushed me to bring this idea into reality. As you may have noticed, I&apos;m in a wheelchair. In 2010, during a friend&apos;s birthday celebration, I unsuccessfully took a trip on a slide with a sports ice sled and crashed my back into a group of trees. As a result - I gained a spinal fracture, three operations, and a long process of rehabilitation. Due to the injury, I lost the ability to move my legs. The neurosurgeon advised me to use my imagination here. I had to imagine that I was moving my legs. At this point, fans of Quentin Tarantino&apos;s work should recall a fragment from &apos;Kill Bill&apos;, in which Uma Thurman tries to move his toes after a long coma, lying in the back seat of a car parked in a hospital parking lot. These are the tasks that, following the advice of my doctors, I have been doing for a while now. Indeed, this is very energy-intensive.

42423125,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2WX9h,1655204319,Morgan Stanley Says Ether Underperformance Echoes Crypto Downturn of 2018,"The largest altcoin, ether (ETH), is underperforming bitcoin (BTC), just as it did during the downturn in crypto markets in 2018, Morgan Stanley (MS) said in a report Monday.  U.S. dollar liquidity is being withdrawn from markets and expectations of higher Federal Reserve interest rates are hurting crypto prices, the report says.  Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, has dropped about 75% from its November peak, analysts led by Sheena Shah wrote.  “When the ETH/BTC relative cross falls, it is a sign that the broader crypto enthusiasm is waning” as money is being pulled out of the more volatile alternative coins, the note says.  Although ether’s price cycle in U.S. dollar terms is similar to 2018, the analysts noted that this time round it’s largely institutional investors driving sales. In 2018, the share of retail trading activity was much higher.  The crypto-equivalent of quantitative tightening has continued, the bank said, fueling BTC’s slide to below $28,000, an important technical level. Any investors who bought BTC in the last year are now at a loss, and there are no obvious technical levels to watch until about $19,500, the 2017 high, it added.  For stablecoins, “issuance is contracting quickly,” the report says, and that has contributed to leverage halving within the “decentralized crypto ecosystem” since the beginning of May, and the destabilizing of crypto derivative prices as they diverge from their underlying assets.

Liquidation refers to when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. It happens when a trader is unable to meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position (fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open).  The losses came as bitcoin (BTC) lost a major support level under $25,000 Monday, with crypto market capitalization reaching levels previously seen in January 2021. Major cryptocurrencies declined by an average of over 15%, as reported.  Bitcoin accounted for over $532 million of all liquidations, followed by ether (ETH) at $317 million and Solana’s SOL token at nearly $20 million. Futures tracking Cardano’s ADA, Stepn’s GMT, and Binance ecosystem token BNB saw over $6 million in losses each, with some 213,000 individual trading accounts seeing liquidations in the past 24 hours.  Longs, or traders betting on higher prices, saw over $510 million in liquidations. Shorts, or bets on lower prices, saw $554 million in losses, suggesting futures traders added to market volatility and affected traders almost equally in either direction.  Crypto exchange FTX recorded over $417 million in liquidations, the most among its counterparts, followed by OKX at $251 million and Binance at $198 million.  Open interest – or the number of unsettled futures contracts – decreased by 7% in the past 24 hours to $23 billion, suggesting a considerable number of traders closed their positions expecting further market volatility.  Bitcoin traded at just over $22,000 in European hours Tuesday, continuing a nearly 12-week slide. The asset has lost some 66% of its value from lifetime highs of $69,000 in November.  Much of the decline in the past few months has come as the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) plans to hike rates in the coming months to battle the ill effects of record inflation – a move that has inadvertently caused a slide in global stocks and subsequently cryptocurrencies as investors take money off assets deemed risky.

Kathy Hochul to veto a bill passed June 3 that would impose a moratorium on proof-of-work (PoW) mining in the state for two years, Crain's New York Business reported Tuesday.  The New York State Senate passed the bill targeting proof-of-work in an effort to address some of the environmental concerns about cryptocurrencies.  The bill, which was passed by the state Assembly in May, would impose a two-year moratorium on new PoW mining projects powered by carbon-based fuel in the Empire State, though existing mining firms or ones currently undergoing the permit renewal process would be allowed to continue operations. The Senate voted 36-27 in favor of the bill.  According to the bill's Democratic sponsor, state Sen. Kevin Parker of Brooklyn, there is only one such plant in current operation that wouldn't be affected by the bill. He added that there is one pending application that may be put on hold until the study has concluded.  During the moratorium, the state will conduct a study on the potential environmental impact of proof-of-work mining.

This went on for days until the end of the first week of June. However, before the end of the period, the price finally rose to the coveted $30,000.

The US is seeing the largest year-on-year increase of the Consumer Price Index since December 1981. Inflation has not been &apos;flattening out&apos; as Fed Chair Jerome Powell expected in May. Many analysts think this calls for a hawkish Fed and have predicted the next interest raise hike to be higher than previously announced. But others think that the Fed is not likely to surprise investors with a higher hike, so a hawkish scenario is still doubtful. Nevertheless, the fear of recession is here and so is the bear market. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. strategist Marko Kolanovic explained in a note shared by Bloomberg why the next move could remain dovish: &apos;Friday&apos;s strong CPI print that led to a surge in yields, along with the sell-off in crypto over the weekend, are weighing on investor sentiment and driving the market lower… However, we believe rates market repricing went too far and the Fed will surprise dovishly relative to what is now priced into the curve.&apos; But JPMorgan economist Michael Feroli thinks the opposite and ex...",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/the-bitcoin-swing-set-possible-outcomes-of-a-dovish-vs-hawkish-fed/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin and other cryptos have a dark day.  Insights: Observers of digital assets react differently to Celsius's announcement to pause withdrawals.  Technician's take: (In place of Technician's Take, First Mover Asia is re-publishing a recent Consensus 2022-related column by CoinDesk columnist Daniel Kuhn.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis. And sign up for First Mover,our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $22,209 -16.6%  Ether (ETH): $1,193 -17%  Biggest Gainers  There are no gainers in CoinDesk 20 today.  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Ethereum ETH −16.4% Smart Contract Platform Bitcoin BTC −16.3% Currency Dogecoin DOGE −15.7% Currency  A Dark Day for Bitcoin and Other Cryptos  Investors had their choice of comparatives for describing bitcoin's deep dive on Monday.  Bitcoin sank to its lowest level since December 2020.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization fell to less than a third of its all-time high of nearly $70,000 just eight months ago and less than half of where it perched at the start of 2022.  It was down 16% over the past 24 hours, a rare single-day, double-digit dip, and off over 30% from a month ago when it settled around $30,000 following the collapse of the terraUSD token. It fell for the seventh consecutive day.  By most any measure, bitcoin had a very, very, very bad day.  So did cryptos in general, whose combined market cap tumbled below $1 trillion for the first time since early 2021 amid ongoing inflation fears and a torrent of bad news from various protocols, including crypto lending platform Celsius's announcement that it was pausing withdrawals amid ""extreme market conditions.""  Bitcoin was recently trading at about $22,500, down more than 16% over the past day. As for major altcoins, the question wasn't whether they were in the red but by how much. Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, was changing hands at roughly $1,200, off over 17% during the same period and its lowest level since January 2021. CRO was off more than 20% at one point amid news that the crypto exchange would pare about 5% of its workforce, roughly 260 jobs. Wrapped bitcoin (WBTC) and TRX were down nearly the same at that time.  Market analysts had a lot to say about the plunge. Little of it offered immediate comfort.  ""It's a storm,"" 3iQ Digital Asset's head of research Mark Connors told CoinDesk in a phone interview.  ""Bitcoin bears certainly are in ruckus mode, berating the largest crypto the way a schoolyard bully seeks out for tormenting the same easy mark,"" Uphold financial consultant Rich Blake wrote.  ""Sentiment for cryptos is terrible as the global crypto market cap has fallen below $1 trillion dollars,"" Oanda senior analyst Edward Moya wrote. ""Bitcoin is attempting to form a base, but if price action falls below the $20,000 level, it could get even uglier.  ‘’As inflation proves to be an even trickier opponent to beat than expected, bitcoin and ether are continuing to get a severe bruising in the ring,"" Hargreaves Lansdown senior investment and markets analyst Susannah Streeter wrote. ""They are prime victims of the flight away from risky assets as investors fret about spiraling consumer prices around the world.""  Cryptos' suffering tracked the hammering of major equity indexes with technology stocks at the forefront of the carnage. The S&P 500 fell 3.8%, re-entering bear market territory – meaning that it has lost 20% of its value from its previous high. The tech-heavy Nasdaq, which hit bear market ground weeks ago, was down a whopping 4.6%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 2.7%.  Even gold, a traditional safe-haven asset, declined by nearly 3%.  Investors will be anxiously watching the U.S. Federal Reserve's two-day meeting, which begins Tuesday and is widely expected to culminate with a 50-basis point interest rate hike as part of an ongoing effort to stem stubbornly high inflation. The latest U.S. Consumer Price Index report showed inflation rising 8.6%, a four-decade peak.  3iQ's Connors noted optimistically that the current crypto spiral was ""within the band of growth"" relative to other steep drops in crypto's 13-plus-year history. ""I wasn't around in 2018 for that $20,000 to $3,000 move, but the playing field is much different now as far as the number of people in it (and) the presidential mandate,"" he said, referring to U.S. President Joe Biden's executive order regarding crypto regulation. ""If you take the band of volatility over the past five years, we're still within it.""  Connors also said: ""The adoption rate the last time we checked both general wallets as well as institutions and mentions in 10-Qs are all at elevated levels. The fundamentals are intact.""  Still, the crypto industry has found itself struggling anew Monday with a now less-certain future. Lending platform BlockFi said it would slice about 20% of its workforce. Crypto.com and BlockFi's cuts followed closely after similar announcements by the Winklevoss twins-led exchange Gemini and Middle Eastern crypto-exchange Rain Financial, among others. On Monday, Binance, the world's largest major crypto exchange by trading volume, paused withdrawals for a brief period.  ""As far as support levels, the next few days surely will test digital assets if a faster pace of tightening and more aggressive rate hikes are announced,"" Uphold's Blake wrote. ""For the moment, extreme market conditions and fed policy updates are exacerbating the consequences for crypto assets.""  Markets  S&P 500: 3,749 -3.8%  DJIA: 30,516 -2.7%  Nasdaq: 10,809 -4.6%  Gold: $1,821 -2.9%  Insights  Analysts Differ on Celsius Pause  Prominent crypto lending firm Celsius paused withdrawals and swap products early Monday, citing ""extreme market conditions” amid a market downturn. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies lost over 12% of total market capitalization as traders responded pessimistically to the latest U.S. Consumer Price Index report showing that inflation continued to rise in May.  Celsius’s announcement followed an April dictum in which Celsius told non-accredited investors that they could no longer transfer funds. The firm’s products are popular among crypto investors, and it offers yields of over 17% on deposits – a rate higher than those provided by most banks.  While retail crypto investors winced over the news, sentiment among analysts and market observers was mixed as some criticized the move while others said Celsius could be protecting user funds.  “Although such a decision is not unusual, as this is not a new phenomenon for centralized financial institutions, it will certainly affect the platform’s users and their desire to use centralized platforms like Celsius,” said Kate Kurbanova, co-founder of risk management platform Apostro, in an email to CoinDesk.  “I think that this decision was made while taking the Black Thursday of 2020 as prices of major cryptocurrencies fell steeply and caused a cascade of liquidations on lending platforms and its users lost their money,” Kurbanova explained.  Kurbanova added that users could choose what risks they consider acceptable, such as risk-facing liquidations and hacks on decentralized platforms but with the ability to withdraw money at any time or use centralized platforms which could be safer from a security standpoint but face a “risk of your assets being frozen for an indefinite period of time.”  Some market observers drew parallels with the implosion of Terra’s terraUSD (UST) stablecoin in mid-May, which caused prices of its related luna (LUNA) tokens to drop nearly 100% and value locked on decentralized finance (DeFi) applications to plunge by $28 billion.  “The broader industry gets very uneasy with the mention of any news or event that can hurt investors, be it retail or corporate following the May episode of Terra’s legacy UST stablecoin collapse,” explained Vadym Synegin, vice president at ecosystem project WeWay.  “Celsius is sending out a message that it is currently insolvent and this is bound to usher in an unprecedented panic withdrawal whenever this access is granted to users. The crypto ecosystem does not respond well to panic events,” Synegin added.  Some analysts opined Celsius could have switched to newer strategies to continue to provide yields to users.  “Finding liquid assets that can pay high returns for $1 billion is not very hard to do; finding liquid assets for $30 billion, whilst keeping returns at such high rates, is almost impossible to do,” said Austin Kimm, director of strategy and investments at Choise.com, in a Telegram chat. “The only solution is to switch off deposits or move into much less liquid assets such as real estate, or crypto mining equipment.”  Meanwhile, Fabio Pezzotti, CEO of crypto investment fund Iconium, said Celsius’s move to pause withdrawals was a preventive measure to help the firm stabilize liquidity on the popular staked ether (stETH) product.  “During the last few days, rumors began to circulate that Celsius had become insolvent due to its high exposure to stETH, the Ethereum derivative by Lido Finance which began to lose its ETH ’peg’ last week,” Pezzotti said in a chat. “Talking about ’peg’ is not totally correct as stETH are derivative instruments collateralized by ETH 1:1. But since they become redeemable only after Ethereum’s merge, stETH’s price is decided by the market, which has determined a discount factor on the early conversion.  “Celsius was holding stETH to provide returns on the ETH deposited by their clients on its platform. The FUD generated by the stETH depeg and the current market conditions have dried up Celsius' on-hand reserves, forcing the company to pause withdrawals to stabilize liquidity. This is a preventive measure, already seen during market crashes, which serves precisely to avoid a total collapse,” Pezzotti said.  Technician's take  The 5 ‘Unsolved Problems’ of Crypto According to Dragonfly’s Haseeb Qureshi  (Editor's Note: In place of Technician's Take, First Mover Asia is re-publishing a column by CoinDesk columnist Daniel Kuhn based on an interview at Consensus 2022.)  Dragonfly Capital’s Haseeb Qureshi thinks there are five problem areas in crypto that you can make a fortune in solving. Those are identity, scalability, privacy, interoperability and UX (user experience).  A former poker player turned venture capitalist and philanthropist, Qureshi looks to blockchain as both a source of revenue and social good.  “The most important thing about crypto is permissionless innovation,” he said. “That’s the idea that you do not need to get a license or a business plan approved. You can just deploy a contract on-chain and it starts getting users.”  See also: Dragonfly's Haseeb Qureshi Is Still Optimistic in the Crypto Bear Market  And so, Qureshi says, even if crypto has problems, it might prove its utility by allowing anyone to innovate.  At Consensus 2022 in Austin, Texas, CoinDesk asked Qureshi to explain crypto’s growing pains, and how he thinks about its longstanding issues. Here’s what he said (the transcript has been lightly edited for clarity and brevity):  Privacy  When you think about privacy, everything you do in DeFi [decentralized finance] is viewable. We've gotten used to that in crypto, but that's not the way of the future. There will be some trade-off that we can make that is going to be similar to the kind of privacy we expect in the real world that would still give us the auditability that we care about and that makes DeFi, DeFi.  See also: Lunarpunks, Privacy and the New Encryption Guerillas  Interoperability  Right now, you're extremely aware of what chain you're on. You know if you’re on Solana or Avalanche or Ethereum. At some point in the future, almost without a doubt, you will have digital assets and you will interact with applications – and that will be your relationship with [the blockchain].  On the internet, you don't interact with this service or that service. You don't interact with Cloudflare, and you certainly don't give a s**t about TCP/IP. Your allegiance is to your application. So in the future, if you want to do yield aggregation, instead of just looking at Yearn, you’ll look at what's the best yield anywhere in crypto. It will just be like calling out to another server on the internet.  Scalability  The fastest blockchains do fewer than, like, 1,000 TPS [transactions per second] each. You can argue about the margin there, but the bottom line is that none of them do that much throughput today. And for us to really get to world scale, all blockchains need to be much faster, much more scalable and have a much higher throughput. That applies to rollups and the like, too.  You want to get to not just tens of millions of users but hundreds of millions of users. Further, we talk a lot about users but we don't talk much about access patterns. If you want access patterns that look anything like what people do in Web 2, you need much, much, much more scalability.  You could argue that bitcoin is the most used cryptocurrency because it has the most holders. I don't know the exact numbers, but something like 50% of Americans own crypto. I’d guess more than half [of those] only own bitcoin. And maybe there's one transaction those people, who likely bought BTC on an exchange, actually settle on-chain, if that, per year. If that's the case, the access pattern of someone using bitcoin is that one transaction.  But what's the access patterns of someone using the internet? I don’t know how many Google searches I make per day. So a Web 3 user is gonna result in many transactions per day.  Identity  The issue here is having an online identity that can be relied upon. Let's say I want to offer you credit – credit is about your identity, about who you are but also about my recourse. I can only offer you credit if I know that I have a path toward getting it back. If I don’t know who you are and you run away, I'm underwater immediately. There's no recourse.  Related here is bankruptcy. That’s a punishment that survives you and our relationship if you default on the debt. Bankruptcy is one of the most important innovations that we have made in capital markets. It’s very underappreciated in crypto. It’s the way you protect your remaining assets if you cannot pay back all your creditors and how credits can punish you into the future. You cannot do credit without the concept of bankruptcy. But in order to have that, you need Identity. Identity that persists.  See also: Who You Really Are: A Conversation About Pseudonymity With Default Friend  Identity is also important for things like marketing. People don't think about this very often, but when you sign up for Coinbase, they can tell whether you're institution or retail. If you’re retail, they throw a bunch of incentives and charge you an arm and a leg for every transaction. If you're an institution, they don’t have to pay anything to get on board, but they charge you BIPs [bitcoin improvement proposals] because you're price-sensitive. Brokerages make all their money from retail.  In DeFi, I can't tell whether you are retail or whether you are Jump [Crypto, the digital asset wing of the eponymous hedge fund]. The protocol treats everyone the same. A centralized exchange’s margin would f**king collapse. Imagine how much money could be made if DeFi businesses could know who their customers are. Nobody can do it today because there's no notion of identity.  We're investing in a company called Quadrantid that allows you to selectively disclose parts of your KYC [know-your-customer] background. So you can selectively disclose your country or other parameters about yourself that you might want to prove to an application or business. This means you could KYC to receive an incentive, but may not have to.  UX  MetaMask, for instance, is not the most user-friendly way to transact. We've already seen some wallets start to do it much better, like Solana’s Phantom – great wallet experience. Keplr – great wallets. We've been able to learn from mistakes, and I think we're going to see more and more innovation.
