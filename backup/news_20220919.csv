Hype for this hard fork had been overshadowed by that of the Ethereum Merge, but now that the Merge is done and out of the way, the focus has now fallen back on the Cardano network once more. Given this, there has been much optimism about where the price of ADA is going from here, but the digital asset has not given any indication of positive movement. ADA Fails To Move With the Cardano Vasil hard fork drawing closer, investors have been expecting the kind of market run-up that preceded the Ethereum Merge. However, the price of ADA has not been responding in the same way since it continues to trend low.

42393953,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brdEDV,1663622720,How the Tech Elite Plans to Escape an 'Apocalypse' of Its Own Making,"I got invited to a super-​deluxe resort to deliver a speech to what I assumed would be 100 or so investment bankers. It was by far the largest fee I had ever been offered for a talk – ​about a third of my annual salary as a professor at a public college – ​all to deliver some insight on “the future of technology.”  As a humanist who writes about the impact of digital technology on our lives, I am often mistaken for a futurist. And I’ve never really liked talking about the future, especially for wealthy people. The Q&A sessions always end up more like parlor games, where I’m asked to opine on the latest technology buzzwords as if they were ticker symbols on a stock exchange: AI [artificial intelligence], VR [virtual reality], CRISPR. The audiences are rarely interested in learning about how these technologies work or their impact on society beyond the binary choice of whether or not to invest in them. But money talks, and so do I, so I took the gig.  Douglas Rushkoff is professor of media theory and digital economics at Queens/CUNY, and a writer known for covering early cyberpunk culture. His latest book is ""Survival of the Richest: Escape Fantasies of the Tech Billionaires.""  I flew business class. They gave me noise-​canceling headphones to wear and warmed mixed nuts to eat (yes, they heat the nuts) as I composed a lecture on my MacBook about how digital businesses could foster circular economic principles rather than doubling down on extractive growth-​based capitalism – ​painfully aware that neither the ethical value of my words nor the carbon offsets I had purchased along with my ticket could possibly compensate for the environmental damage I was doing. I was funding my mortgage and my daughter’s college savings plan at the expense of the people and places down below.  A limo was waiting for me at the airport and took me straight out into the high desert. I tried to make conversation with the driver about the UFO cults that operate in that part of the country and the desolate beauty of the terrain compared with the frenzy of New York. I suppose I felt an urge to make sure he understood I’m not of the class of people who usually sit in the back of a limo like this. As if to make the opposite point about himself, he finally disclosed that he wasn’t a full-​time driver but a day trader a bit down on his luck after a few “poorly timed puts.”  See also: How Web3 and Bitcoin Billionaires Will Revolutionize Charity | Opinion  As the sun began to dip over the horizon, I realized I had been in the car for three hours. What sort of wealthy hedge fund types would drive this far from the airport for a conference? Then I saw it. On a parallel path next to the highway, as if racing against us, a small jet was coming in for a landing on a private airfield. Of course.  Just over the next bluff was the most luxurious yet isolated place I’ve ever been. A resort and spa in the middle of, well, nowhere. A scattering of modern stone and glass structures were nestled into a big rock formation, looking out on the infinity of the desert. I saw no one but attendants as I checked in and had to use a map to find my way to my private “pavilion” for the night. I had my own outdoor hot tub.  The next morning, two men in matching Patagonia fleece came for me in a golf cart and conveyed me through rocks and underbrush to a meeting hall. They left me to drink coffee and prepare in what I figured was serving as my green room. But instead of me being wired with a microphone or taken to a stage, my audience was brought in to me. They sat around the table and introduced themselves: five super-​wealthy guys – ​yes, all men – ​from the upper echelon of the tech investing and hedge fund world. At least two of them were billionaires. After a bit of small talk, I realized they had no interest in the talk I had prepared about the future of technology. They had come to ask questions.  They started out innocuously and predictably enough. Bitcoin or Ethereum? Virtual reality or augmented reality? Who will get quantum computing first, China or Google? But they didn’t seem to be taking it in. No sooner would I begin to explain the merits of proof-​of-​stake versus proof-​of-​work blockchains than they would move to the next question. I started to feel like they were testing me – not my knowledge so much as my scruples.  Eventually, they edged into their real topic of concern: New Zealand or Alaska? Which region will be less impacted by the coming climate crisis? It only got worse from there. Which was the greater threat: climate change or biological warfare? How long should one plan to be able to survive with no outside help? Should a shelter have its own air supply? What is the likelihood of groundwater contamination? Finally, the CEO of a brokerage house explained that he had nearly completed building his own underground bunker system, and asked, “How do I maintain authority over my security force after the Event?” The Event. That was their euphemism for the environmental collapse, social unrest, nuclear explosion, solar storm, unstoppable virus or malicious computer hack that takes everything down.  This single question occupied us for the rest of the hour. They knew armed guards would be required to protect their compounds from raiders as well as angry mobs. One had already secured a dozen Navy SEALs to make their way to his compound if he gave them the right cue. But how would he pay the guards once even his crypto was worthless? What would stop the guards from eventually choosing their own leader?  The billionaires considered using special combination locks on the food supply that only they knew. Or making guards wear disciplinary collars of some kind in return for their survival. Or maybe building robots to serve as guards and workers – ​if that technology could be developed “in time.”  I tried to reason with them. I made pro-​social arguments for partnership and solidarity as the best approaches to our collective, long-​term challenges. The way to get your guards to exhibit loyalty in the future is to treat them like friends right now, I explained. Don’t just invest in ammo and electric fences, invest in people and relationships. They rolled their eyes at what must have sounded to them like hippie philosophy, so I cheekily suggested that the way to make sure your head of security doesn’t slit your throat tomorrow is to pay for his daughter’s bat mitzvah today. They laughed. At least they were getting their money’s worth in entertainment.  I could tell they were also a bit annoyed. I wasn’t taking them seriously enough. But how could I? This was probably the wealthiest, most powerful group I had ever encountered. Yet here they were, asking a Marxist media theorist for advice on where and how to configure their doomsday bunkers. That’s when it hit me: At least as far as these gentlemen were concerned, this was a talk about the future of technology.  See also: 7 Crypto Billionaires Make Forbes 2021 List of Richest Americans  Taking their cue from Tesla founder Elon Musk colonizing Mars, Palantir’s Peter Thiel reversing the aging process or artificial intelligence developers Sam Altman and Ray Kurzweil uploading their minds into supercomputers, they were preparing for a digital future that had less to do with making the world a better place than it did with transcending the human condition altogether. Their extreme wealth and privilege served only to make them obsessed with insulating themselves from the very real and present danger of climate change, rising sea levels, mass migrations, global pandemics, nativist panic and resource depletion. For them, the future of technology is about only one thing: escape from the rest of us.  These people once showered the world with madly optimistic business plans for how technology might benefit human society. Now they’ve reduced technological progress to a video game that one of them wins by finding the escape hatch. Will it be Jeff Bezos migrating to space, Peter Thiel to his New Zealand compound, or Mark Zuckerberg to his virtual metaverse? And these catastrophizing billionaires are the presumptive winners of the digital economy – ​the supposed champions of the survival-​of-​the-​fittest business landscape that’s fueling most of this speculation to begin with.  Of course, it wasn’t always this way. There was a brief moment, in the early 1990s, when the digital future felt open-​ended. In spite of its origins in military cryptography and defense networking, digital technology had become a playground for the counterculture, who saw in it the opportunity to invent a more inclusive, distributed and participatory future. Indeed, the “digital renaissance,” as I began to call it back in 1991, was about the unbridled potential of the collective human imagination. It spanned everything from chaos math and quantum physics to fantasy role-​playing.  Many of us in that early cyberpunk era believed that – connected and coordinated as never before – ​human beings could create any future we imagined. We read magazines called Reality Hackers, FringeWare and Mondo2000, which equated cyberspace with psychedelics, computer hacking with conscious evolution and online networking with massive electronic dance music parties called raves. The artificial boundaries of linear, cause-​and-​effect reality and top-​down classifications would be superseded by a fractal of emerging interdependencies. Chaos was not random, but rhythmic. We would stop seeing the ocean through the cartographer’s grid of latitude and longitude lines, but in the underlying patterns of the water’s waves. “Surf’s up,” I announced in my first book on digital culture.  No one took us very seriously. That book was actually canceled by its original publisher in 1992 because they thought the computer networking fad would be “over” before my publication date in late 1993. It wasn’t until Wired magazine launched later that year, reframing the emergence of the internet as a business opportunity, that people with power and money began to take notice. The fluorescent pages of the magazine’s first issue announced that “a tsunami was coming.” The articles suggested that only the investors who kept track of the scenario-​planners and futurists on their pages would be able to survive the wave.  See also: What Happens When You Die in the Metaverse? | Opinion  This wasn’t going to be about the psychedelic counterculture, hypertext adventures or collective consciousness. No, the digital revolution wasn’t a revolution at all but a business opportunity – ​a chance to pump steroids into the already dying Nasdaq stock exchange, and maybe to milk another couple of decades of growth out of an economy presumed dead since the biotech crash of 1987.  Everyone crowded back into the tech sector for the dot-com boom. Internet journalism moved off the culture and media pages of the newspaper and into the business section. Established business interests saw new potential in the net, but only for the same old extraction they’d always done, while promising young technologists were seduced by unicorn IPOs [initial public offerings] and multimillion-​dollar payouts. Digital futures became understood more like stock futures or cotton futures – ​something to predict and make bets on. Likewise, technology users were treated less as creators to empower than consumers to manipulate. The more predictable the users’ behaviors, the more certain the bet.  Nearly every speech, article, study, documentary or white paper on the emerging digital society began to point to a ticker symbol. The future became less a thing we create through our present-​day choices or hopes for humankind than a predestined scenario we bet on with our venture capital but arrive at passively.  This freed everyone from the moral implications of their activities. Technology development became less a story of collective flourishing than personal survival through the accumulation of wealth. Worse, as I learned in writing books and articles about such compromises, to call attention to any of this was to unintentionally cast oneself as an enemy of the market or an anti-​technology curmudgeon. After all, the growth of technology and that of the market were understood as the same thing: inevitable, and even morally desirable.  Market sensibilities overpowered much of the media and intellectual space that would have normally been filled by a consideration of the practical ethics of impoverishing the many in the name of the few. Too much mainstream debate centered instead on abstract hypotheticals about our predestined high-​tech future: Is it fair for a stock trader to use smart drugs? Should children get implants for foreign languages? Do we want autonomous vehicles to prioritize the lives of pedestrians over those of its passengers? Should the first Mars colonies be run as democracies? Does changing my DNA undermine my identity? Should robots have rights?  Asking these sorts of questions, which we still do today, may be philosophically entertaining but it is a poor substitute for wrestling with the real moral quandaries associated with unbridled technological development in the name of corporate capitalism. Digital platforms have turned an already exploitative and extractive marketplace (think Walmart) into an even more dehumanizing successor (think Amazon). Most of us became aware of these downsides in the form of automated jobs, the gig economy and the demise of local retail along with local journalism.  See also: 'We Blew It.' Douglas Rushkoff's Take on the Future of the Web | Interview  But the more devastating impacts of pedal-​to-​the-​metal digital capitalism fall on the environment, the global poor and the civilizational future their oppression portends. The manufacture of our computers and smartphones still depends on networks of slave labor. These practices are deeply entrenched. A company called Fairphone, founded to make and market ethical phones, learned it was impossible. (The company’s founder now sadly refers to its products as “fairer” phones.) Meanwhile, the mining of rare earth metals and disposal of our highly digital technologies destroys human habitats, replacing them with toxic waste dumps, which are then picked over by impoverished indigenous children and their families, who sell usable materials back to the manufacturers – ​who then cynically claim this “recycling” is part of their larger efforts at environmentalism and social good.  This “out of sight, out of mind” externalization of poverty and poison doesn’t go away just because we’ve covered our eyes with VR goggles and immersed ourselves in an alternate reality. If anything, the longer we ignore the social, economic and environmental repercussions, the more of a problem they become. This, in turn, motivates even more withdrawal, more isolationism and apocalyptic fantasy – ​and more desperately concocted technologies and business plans. The cycle feeds itself.  The more committed we are to this view of the world, the more we come to see other human beings as the problem and technology as the way to control and contain them. We treat the deliciously quirky, unpredictable and irrational nature of humans less as a feature than a bug. No matter their own embedded biases, technologies are declared neutral. Any bad behaviors they induce in us are just a reflection of our own corrupted core. It’s as if some innate, unshakeable human savagery is to blame for our troubles. Just as the inefficiency of a local taxi market can be “solved” with an app that bankrupts human drivers, the vexing inconsistencies of the human psyche can be corrected with a digital or genetic upgrade.  Ultimately, according to the technosolutionist orthodoxy, the human future climaxes by uploading our consciousness to a computer or, perhaps better, accepting that technology itself is our evolutionary successor. Like members of a gnostic cult, we long to enter the next transcendent phase of our development, shedding our bodies and leaving them behind, along with our sins and troubles and – ​most of all – ​our economic inferiors.  Our movies and television fare play out these fantasies for us. Zombie shows depict a post-​apocalypse where people are no better than the undead – ​and seem to know it. Worse, these shows invite viewers to imagine the future as a zero-​sum battle between the remaining humans, where one group’s survival is dependent on another one’s demise. Even our most forward-​thinking science fiction shows now depict robots as our intellectual and ethical superiors. It’s always the humans who are reduced to a few lines of code, and the artificial intelligences who learn to make more complex and willful choices.  See also: The Transhumanist Case for Crypto | Opinion  The mental gymnastics required for such a profound role reversal between humans and machines all depend on the underlying assumption that most humans are essentially worthless and unthinkingly self-​destructive. Let’s either change them or get away from them forever. Thus, we get tech billionaires launching electric cars into space – as if this symbolizes something more than one billionaire’s capacity for corporate promotion. And if a few people do reach escape velocity and somehow survive in a bubble on Mars – despite our inability to maintain such a bubble even here on Earth in either of two multibillion-​dollar Biosphere trials – the result would be less a continuation of the human diaspora than a lifeboat for the elite. Most thinking, breathing human beings understand there is no escape.  What I came to realize as I sat sipping imported iceberg water and pondering doomsday scenarios with our society’s great winners is that these men are actually the losers. The billionaires who called me out to the desert to evaluate their bunker strategies are not the victors of the economic game so much as the victims of its perversely limited rules. More than anything, they have succumbed to a mindset where “winning” means earning enough money to insulate themselves from the damage they are creating by earning money in that way. It’s as if they want to build a car that goes fast enough to escape from its own exhaust.  Yet this Silicon Valley escapism – let’s call it The Mindset – ​encourages its adherents to believe that the winners can somehow leave the rest of us behind. Maybe that’s been their objective all along. Perhaps this fatalist drive to rise above and separate from humanity is no more the result of runaway digital capitalism than its cause – a way of treating one another and the world that can be traced back to the sociopathic tendencies of empirical science, individualism, sexual domination and perhaps even “progress” itself.  Yet while tyrants since the time of Pharaoh and Alexander the Great may have sought to sit atop great civilizations and rule them from above, never before have our society’s most powerful players assumed that the primary impact of their own conquests would be to render the world itself unlivable for everyone else. Nor have they ever before had the technologies through which to program their sensibilities into the very fabric of our society. The landscape is alive with algorithms and intelligences actively encouraging these selfish and isolationist outlooks. Those sociopathic enough to embrace them are rewarded with cash and control over the rest of us. It’s a self-​reinforcing feedback loop. This is new.  Amplified by digital technologies and the unprecedented wealth disparity they afford, The Mindset allows for the easy externalization of harm to others, and inspires a corresponding longing for transcendence and separation from the people and places that have been abused. As we will see, The Mindset is based in a staunchly atheistic and materialist scientism, a faith in technology to solve problems, an adherence to biases of digital code, an understanding of human relationships as market phenomena, a fear of nature and women, a need to see one’s contributions as utterly unique innovations without precedent and an urge to neutralize the unknown by dominating and de-​animating it.  Instead of just lording over us forever, however, the billionaires at the top of these virtual pyramids actively seek the endgame. In fact, like the plot of a Marvel blockbuster, the very structure of The Mindset requires an endgame. Everything must resolve to a one or a zero, a winner or loser, the saved or the damned. Actual, imminent catastrophes from the climate emergency to mass migrations support the mythology, offering these would-​be superheroes the opportunity to play out the finale in their own lifetimes. For The Mindset also includes a faith-​based Silicon Valley certainty that they can develop a technology that will somehow break the laws of physics, economics and morality to offer them something even better than a way of saving the world: a means of escape from the apocalypse of their own making.

42373804,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvVE4x,1663620129,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Regains $19K and Ether Rises as FOMC Meeting Nears,"Price Action  Bitcoin and ether took different paths on Monday, with bitcoin declining and ether going higher.  Bitcoin (BTC) was up 0.30% on strong daily volume. The price fluctuated widely throughout the day as the largest cryptocurrency by market cap at one point fell below $19,000. A sharp drop of 3.47% took place during the 02:00 UTC (6 a.m. ET) hour but prices reversed course as U.S. markets opened. The decline occurred on six times the average trading volume and implies an overreaction to the downside that was subsequently corrected. There was little in the way of economic data reports that could account for the decline.  Ether (ETH) was 1.72% higher, ending a slide that began after last week’s successful Ethereum Merge. A look at ether’s hourly chart indicates a similar pattern to BTC in that it also fell on higher volume during the 02:00 UTC hour, only to reverse course later. Ether has fallen approximately 17% since the Merge.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based market index that measures crypto performance across a basket of currencies, declined 0.35%  Economic Calendar: The highlight of the economic calendar this week will be Wednesday’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting and its expected interest rate decision.  Markets are ascribing an 80% chance that the Fed funds rate will increase by 75 basis points and a 20% chance that it will increase by 100 basis points, or 1%. Rates have not increased by 1% in over 40 years.  Between 1978 and 1981, the Federal Reserve raised rates by 1% seven times during the term of then-Chairman Paul Volcker because of soaring inflation.  U.S. Equities: Traditional equities rose. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), tech-heavy Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 increased by 0.6%, 0.8%, and 0.7%, respectively.  Commodities: In energy markets, the price of WTI crude oil moved 0.42% higher, with natural gas increasing 1.6%. In metals, traditional safe haven gold rose just 0.01%, while copper futures increased 0.26%.  The Dollar Index (DXY) was relatively flat, down 0.03%.  Latest Prices  ● Bitcoin (BTC): $19,465 −1.3%        ● Ether (ETH): $1,361 −1.3%        ● CoinDesk Market Index (CMI): $960 −1.3%        ● S&P 500 daily close: 3,899.89 +0.7%        ● Gold: $1,684 per troy ounce +0.7%        ● Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 3.49% +0.04        Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Technical Take  Bitcoin and ether face challenges  Traders will have difficulty pinpointing a price direction for BTC and ETH because both assets appear tied to macroeconomic data and overall appetite for risk. Ether’s most recent catalyst, i.e., the Ethereum blockchain’s Merge upgrade, has come and gone.  While the Merge has been widely deemed as successful, ether’s price is down 17% since the upgrade took place because investors appear to have taken a “sell-the-news” approach to the second-largest cryptocurrency.  One factor lately for the BTC and ETH prices is the strength — or lack thereof against — of the U.S. dollar, as the dollar index (DXY) has a strong inverse relationship to bitcoin's price. BTC's price is down approximately 58% year to date but the DXY has risen 15% over the same period.  M2 money supply, a measure of money supply within the economy, has declined 5% since January, in line with the Federal Reserve’s stance on reducing inflation.  Market participants are likely eyeing data that affects the strength of the U.S. dollar as a signal for digital assets’ price direction. Ultimately, what strengthens the dollar weakens digital assets, and vice versa. Decreasing money supply and the anticipated increase in the Fed funds rate are actions that do just that.  From a technical perspective, larger institutions have recently reduced their BTC holdings. The Commitment of Traders report, published by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) each Tuesday illustrates positions held by traders in futures markets.  Long positions of larger speculators, denoted in green, dropped sharply on Sept. 13, coinciding with the 10% decline that occurred on that day. Traditionally, the COT report offers an inside look at where institutional investors are allocating capital.  Oftentimes, though not always, larger speculators have tended to add to long positions near market bottoms and enter short positions near market tops.  Looking at price action compared to COT data for bitcoin indicates that it has not proven as simple for BTC as it has with other commodities. Still, absent an uptick in long positions by larger speculators, BTC prices are likely to trade within a tight range in the near term.

Investment products tied to ETH saw a fourth straight week of outflows in the period ended Sept. 16, with the amount removed exceeding new money added by $15.4 million, according to CoinShares. This was not an across-the-board trend in crypto. Funds that invest in ETH’s bigger rival, bitcoin (BTC), broke a five-week streak of outflows as investors added a net $17.4 million.  ETH’s price has fallen significantly since the Merge – which has been heralded as an event that could lure more large investors to the ecosystem – even though the perilous upgrade went smoothly.

42421447,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoMY9,1663616821,Why Russia Isn’t Relying on Crypto to Evade Sanctions,"Days after Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February, Western states, led by the U.S. and European Union, levied vast sanctions on the Russian economy, hoping to drive Moscow into an economic crisis that would prompt a military retreat.  Yet within a matter of days, U.S. officials and top financial analysts were warning that Moscow might use cryptocurrency to circumvent Western sanctions, fearing that blockchain-based platforms could enable Russians to evade U.S. anti-money laundering (AML) regulations and stave off economic collapse.  Mark Lurie is the CEO and co-founder of Shipyard Software. He is a serial entrepreneur and investor who previously founded two venture-backed startups.  One possible scenario is that Russian miners leverage the country’s plentiful energy reserves to mine bitcoin (BTC), then use unhosted wallets to move those bitcoins through a series of shady crypto transactions – likely involving chain-hopping, tumblers and peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplaces – to convert them into U.S. dollars to pay for goods. Well-known mixer Tornado Cash, which the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned in August, has already been used to launder some $9 billion, so it may seem a feasible option.  But nearly seven months in, Russia has not gone this route. In fact, very little Russian money has been funneled through crypto. In April, the Wall Street Journal reported that daily ruble trading in cryptocurrencies spiked to 6.6 billion (US$46 million) in the days after Russia’s invasion, before quickly plummeting to 1 billion rubles ($7 million).  Read more: US Treasury Sanctions Russian Paramilitary Group Crowdfunding Ukraine War With Crypto  As of August, Russia’s crypto trading volume remains diminished, with 24-hour ruble to tether (USDT) trade volume currently ranging between 10s and 100s of millions of rubles each day, down from its peak of 4.3 billion rubles in early March.  The words of Todd Conklin, head of the Treasury’s cybersecurity portfolio, seem to have proven true. “You can't flip a switch overnight and run a G-20 economy on cryptocurrency,” he said in March. “There just isn’t enough liquidity.""  If crypto did offer a potential loophole, we could expect to see Russia doing its darndest to drive through it. But thus far we have seen no signs of any concerted Russian effort – governmental or non-governmental – to boost crypto liquidity.  Instead, Russia President Vladimir Putin seems to be putting all his efforts into building alternative financial rails to counter the dollar-based SWIFT financial communications system. This includes Russia’s SWIFT competitor SPFS (System for Transfer of Financial Messages) and its Visa/Mastercard competitor, MIR payments.  Moscow has heavily promoted SPFS to key trade partners that are also Western allies, such as India, Israel and the United Arab Emirates. Some two dozen banks from nearly a dozen countries have signed onto SPFS, including India, Turkey, Iran, China, Germany, Armenia and Switzerland.  Meanwhile, five Turkish banks adopted MIR in July and Iran is in advanced talks to join the network. India, Cuba and Sri Lanka have also expressed interest in joining Mir.  Putin’s sanctions response indicates that he and his cronies view traditional financial tools as more porous than crypto. The Russian president seems to believe that building a traditional, if non-western, financial network offers a better way to evade sanctions than crypto.  And he’s probably right.  The first reason is that transaction data in the traditional financial system is insurmountably vast and likely filled with errors. U.S. regulations, for instance, dictate that if a bank sees a series of $9,999 transactions, ($10,000 is often the reporting threshold), it must send a suspicious activity report (SAR) to the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).  In 2019, U.S. banks filed 2.7 million SARs, or about 10,000 per business day. And these are not short, simple documents, thus leaving room for error.  Read more: Crypto Miners From US, EU Stay Put in Russia Despite War, Sanctions  Peter Dittus, former secretary-general of the Bank for International Settlements, the international bank for the world’s central banks, acknowledged this in a recent conversation, after highlighting the advantages of the traditional financial system.  “[The western banking system] does, however, have two significant shortcomings: an inability to simultaneously monitor all the world’s transactions for questionable origins and an over-confidence in self-interested banks and states abiding by its regulations,” Dittus explained.  “The core constraint of the traditional financial system is that transaction data is nearly impossible to audit,"" he added. In fact, in 2019, after a FinCEN staffer leaked 2,100 SARs, 400 journalists needed 16 months to examine them.  This brings us to the second reason, which is that the blockchain’s transaction data is free of errors and publicly accessible. All on-chain actions are tracked via a permanent, immutable and publicly viewable record. Sure, cryptocurrencies are anonymous to the extent that other users and exchanges may not know your identity, but all users leave breadcrumbs behind.  Whenever a cryptocurrency user makes any sort of transaction his wallet, or digital address, interacts with a crypto exchange or another user, leaving digital fingerprints for authorities to track. This may not fit neatly into the traditional know-your-customer (KYC) framework of today’s AML standards, but it has the potential to create effective new tools like know-your-transaction (KYT) – a different means to the same end.  The success of dictators, human traffickers, terrorists and drug cartels often hinges on their ability to launder money through the traditional financial system. Rather than giving them a lifeline, as some suggest, cryptocurrency gives us a chance to put them out of business – and now we may have proof.  The world knows all too well that no route is too unsavory for Putin to get what he’s after, from committing war-time atrocities to highly advanced digital meddling in electoral democracy. That his attempts to circumvent western sanctions have yet to incorporate crypto speaks volumes about its usefulness as a money laundering tool.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Mark Lurie,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/09/19/why-russia-isnt-relying-on-crypto-to-evade-sanctions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/afbe3946c8427c26c4be326dccb816873426a324-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The first indicator of relevance here is the &apos;Spent Output Age Bands,&apos; which checks for on-chain movement of coins and tells us which age groups were responsible for them.

The group in question here is the &apos;7 years to 10 years old&apos; cohort. The Spent Output chart for this group, therefore, shows how many coins were moved that were previously sitting idle for periods in this range. Here is the graph for it: The value of the metric seems to have spiked up in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As you can see in the chart, the quant has marked the relevant points of trend for this Bitcoin indicator as well as the corresponding BTC price.

As the trial – one of two ongoing civil cases between Wright and Granath – reaches its sixth and likely penultimate day, the case has put under the spotlight a range of evidence Wright furnished in a bid to prove he is the author of the infamous 2008 paper that launched the cryptocurrency revolution – and whether comments tweeted by Granath in March 2019, in which he called Wright a fraud, are protected under Norway’s free speech laws.  Read more: Who Can Say Who Is Not Satoshi? Hodlonaut and Wright Go to Trial to Find Out  In 2015, Wright said he was the Bitcoin founder pseudonymously called Satoshi Nakamoto. He has offered a range of evidence, including purported early drafts of Nakamoto’s 2008 paper that proposed the cryptocurrency, and references to a signing session he held in 2016. In that session, he purported to show witnesses he held the private keys for early bitcoins that only Nakamoto would have.  Witnesses called by Wright on Monday attempted to throw cold water on evidence offered by digital forensics specialists KPMG last week, which sought to unmask those documents as forgeries.  “In digital forensics … if an independent third party were to verify, they should be able to recreate the steps and the environment exactly as it was,” Klaudia Sokolowska, an investigator for cybersecurity company Cyfor, told the court.  But she “did not see an adequate description of their testing environment” to enable her to scientifically reproduce KPMG’s results, Sokolowska said.  Discrepancies detected by KPMG in double spacings in the draft’s text and edit times reported in document metadata couldn’t be reproduced or weren’t reliable indicators, Sokolowska and fellow witness Dashley van Schijndel, a forensic investigator at BDO in Norway, said.  Discrepancies in Wright’s metadata  But even Wright’s witnesses appeared to uphold KPMG findings that the documents, including a supposed early draft of Nakamoto’s white paper, must have been written after 2008 because they used typefaces unavailable at that time.  In one case, the 2008 date on a document used to show Wright had researched the name “Nakamoto” in advance of the white paper’s publication, had used a different, smaller font for the second zero and eight, evidence submitted by KPMG had shown – suggesting it had been tampered with.  DPA’s findings were “consistent … with what KPMG found in their report,” van Schijndel told District Court Judge Helen Engebrigtsen. “This would include the findings in regard to the fonts.”  That was enough for Ørjan Salvesen Haukaas, Granath’s lawyer, to conclude a pattern of misrepresentation by Wright.  “This document has been manipulated. There can be no doubt about that,” said Haukaas. “This isn’t something that happens if you move it from Windows to Linux … it’s something that happens when you use a text editor and you change the text.”  “The fact that these documents were forged wasn’t even contested by Wright in his statement” to the court, Haukaas said.  Wright’s draft included a footnoted reference to a 1998 paper on electronic cash – despite emails suggesting that, at the supposed time of drafting, Nakamoto was uncertain about that paper’s date of publication, Haukaas noted.  Wright’s claims he couldn’t prove his identity because he’d stomped on the hard drives containing the proof are “not credible,” Haukaas said.  Read more: Craig Wright’s Abnormal Psychology  A 2016 ceremony designed to prove Wright had access to Nakamoto’s private keys was a “farce” with a “number of red flags,” Haukaas said, because Wright could have offered a more effective proof more simply. The court had earlier been told of a range of ways in which witnesses to the signature could have been fooled by Wright.  Dismissing testimony from Wright’s former colleagues and family members, offered to the court last week, as either self-interested or not capable of backing up his claims, Haukaas said his case to be Nakamoto was distinctly wobbly.  Wright “could have proved it but chose not to,” Haukaas said. “I didn’t understand the reason. I don't think the rest of you understood it either.”  Freedom to 'express oneself about untrue things'  Those arguments about Nakamoto’s identity are clearly germane to the case.  Documents “are what the case is about,” said Engebrigtsen, adding that she was “not tired” by hours of experts quibbling over font sizes and pdf metadata.  But really, Haukaas said, the question for the court is “not whether he is Satoshi or not,” but “whether he’s entitled to restitution from Mr. Granath” for tweets that described Wright as a “fraud” and “scammer.”  Granath, who went by the Twitter pseudonym Hodlonaut before being doxxed by Wright, has sued Wright in Norway to get a judge to rule that his tweets were protected by freedom of speech – and prevent a libel case filed by Wright in the U.K. seeking financial damages in connection to the tweets from moving forward.  Not only does the term “fraud” fit, Haukaas said, citing the Merriam-Webster definition of a “person who is not what he or she pretends to be” – but he argues the right to use that word is protected by the Norwegian constitution.  “A protection of the right of the individual to seek truth, to express oneself about untrue things is a strong and important right,” Haukaas said.  As such, it might not be Nakamoto’s identity but Norwegian precedents in defamation law that prove the crux of the case.  Nonetheless, Haukaas reckons, the principle of revealing Wright’s true status gets to the heart of the purpose of Bitcoin – a new system of money in which power is distributed.  With blockchain consensus mechanisms, “the general public must step up to the plate … [T]here’s a need for the users to actually get involved,” Haukaas said.

42421436,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoMNp,1663609952,Did the Ethereum Merge Drop ‘Worldwide Electricity Consumption’ by 0.2%?,"Last week, hot off the heels of the Merge, a complicated plan to swap Ethereum’s infrastructure without interrupting the multibillion-dollar cryptocurrency network, Ethereum’s co-founder Vitalik Buterin reshared data suggesting “worldwide electricity consumption” could be reduced by 0.2% as a result.  This talking point, originally discussed by Ethereum researcher Justin Drake, was picked up by U.S. congressmen, technologists and Ethereum’s community, who are right to celebrate the network’s vastly smaller carbon footprint. Proof-of-stake, Ethereum’s new algorithm for processing transactions, would use approximately 99% less power than the proof-of-work (PoW) system Ethereum used to run.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Drake estimated that Ethereum’s total energy consumption before the Merge was around 0.34% of the world’s total. It would be incorrect to say the Merge itself would reduce “worldwide electricity consumption” by that total amount, seeing as many mining machines that once supplied hash power to Ethereum were immediately pointed to alternative PoW blockchains.  Ethereum may be vastly more energy-efficient than it was just a week ago, but the question now becomes whether its PoW-based competitors will grow as large. Ethereum mining used approximately 72 terawatt-hours per year, about as much as the country of Austria, according to Digiconomist, a typically critical economics blog run by Alex de Vries.  Several blockchains saw their contributed hash power (and thus energy consumption) increase in the lead-up to the Merge, and vast bumps in that direction after the event. But judging by the figures shortly after the Merge, it seems these chains – including Ethereum Classic, Ravencoin and the newly forked Ethereum Proof-of-Work – will not be profitable enough to continue paying for their record high security/energy bills.  There are reports of crypto miners powering down less powerful and less efficient GPUs as competition to add blocks to those chains increased. But it’s premature to say that all the specialized EtHash ASIC hardware that once mined ether (ETH) will be turned off forever. Proof-of-work mining is an activity driven by pretty simple supply-and-demand curves: The inputs are the cost of electricity (and hardware) and the price of a network’s token.  Many miners paid upfront for these specially designed computer chips, and thus have an economic incentive to keep them plugged in so long as they’re profitable. That said, it’s unlikely the recent price appreciation in ETC, RVN and ETHW, coextensive with their networks’ increased hash power, is stable in the long term without meaningful user activity and development of those chains.  See also: Ethereum Proof-of-Work Fork Stumbles as Justin Sun's Poloniex Supports Rival Fork  Ethan Vera, chief operations officer of mining services firm Luxor Technologies, tweeted last week that “20%-30% of ETH miners have found a temporary new home amongst other blockchains, the rest are shut down.” This is a figure that could go in either direction, as the market finds price stability after the Merge. It’s likely that after this weekend’s crypto market rout even more machines were turned off.  In fact, Chandler Guo, the primer backer of the ETHW fork, predicted last week 90% of PoW miners of these Ethereum alternatives will likely go “bankrupt,” on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” show.  What about Bitcoin?  Now that Ethereum has pulled off the first part of its multi-stage upgrade, there's increasing pressure on the proof-of-work Bitcoin to decarbonize. ""All eyes will be on Bitcoin. It remains the largest polluter in the crypto space. Even today Bitcoin is responsible for as much electricity consumption as Sweden,"" De Vries told The Guardian.  This sentiment was repeated by the Environmental Working Group (EWG), which released a statement saying Bitcoin stands as the ""lone cryptocurrency climate polluter"" following the Merge. EWG plans to spend a further $1 million on propaganda meant to inspire or force the hand of the Bitcoin community to reduce the network's energy consumption.  EWG's ""Change the Code, Not the Climate"" initiative launched earlier this year with backing from Greenpeace USA, Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen and other small environmental organizations. This movement was taken as a serious affront by many in the Bitcoin community, which sees proof-of-work mining as a cornerstone of Bitcoin's security, decentralization and market neutrality.  It's unlikely Bitcoin will change its code anytime soon. Not that it should: Although proof-of-work mining is energy intensive, Bitcoin could counterintuitively help fund the build-out of net-zero or renewables infrastructure. Highly transportable Bitcoin mining machines can be spun up at stranded energy sources or wind farms, helping to earn revenue for power providers and possibly stabilize the grid, a theory that is at least worth putting into study.  According to the Bitcoin Mining Council, an industry data provider and advocate, Bitcoin uses 189 TWh, accounting for less than 0.2% of the world’s energy consumption, or about as much as Ethereum was estimated to save. That's less than half the energy consumed by either the gold or banking industry. And, unlike other PoW chains like Ethereum Classic or Ethereum PoW, Bitcoin is likely to be able to continue subsidizing its security spend.  The question about bitcoin mining always comes down to ""is it worth it."" Is it worth having a stable and censorship-resistant payments system that's accessible to anyone in the world, even if it uses as much energy as a medium-sized country?

More Than 125,000 Trader Rekt In the 24 hours following bitcoin&apos;s decline to the $18,000 territory, more than 125,000 have had their positions liquidated. This amounted to more than $410 million that has been lost in the past day. Not surprisingly, the vast majority have been long traders who had been betting on the market seeing another recovery. Instead, the drop had caused a ripple effect across the market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Open Interest, Funding Rates Point To Growing Bullish Sentiment According to data from Coinglass, a total of 126,632 traders had lost their positions during this time. The largest single liquidation had been recorded on the Bitmex exchange, where a single trade worth $10 million had been liquidated across the XBTUSD pair. Of the $417 million in liquidations, 87.85% had come out as longs, leaving $52.38 million of shorts during this time.

42393948,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brdDsz,1663606828,"Politicians, Not the Usual Bureaucrats, Take the Reins on Web3 in Japan","The Takeaway  Japan’s politicians are taking the lead on Web3 policymaking, a sharp departure from the usual process in the nation.  Lawmakers have already published a white paper addressing issues including tax reform and non-fungible tokens (NFT).  Crypto bills, including metaverse-related item, are likely to be introduced next year.  Japan's political leaders want to take the country into the Web3 era without the bureaucratic slog that’s typical for the nation’s policymakers.  So far this year, a handful of politicians have been driving crypto and Web3 policy forward on their own, publishing reports and proposing updates to existing laws and regulations. That rapid push began earlier in the year when Japan Prime Minister Fumio Kishida designated Web3 a pillar of economic reform.  A prime minister ‘who listens’  Kishida of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) was elected prime minister in November 2021. Web3 aligns with his administration’s agenda of economic recovery and revitalizing local communities, and could be a way to attract private investment back to Japan and fulfill his campaign promise of growth and wealth distribution.  “The crypto market cap had become a size that no government in this world could ignore,” Arisa Toyosaki, founder of decentralized finance (DeFi) options market Cega, said. “Investors, traders and founders combined could make a fairly significant bump in Japanese economic metrics,” she said.  Kishida’s administration established a policy office dedicated to Web3 under the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, or METI, although it is likely other government bodies, including those responsible for finance, tax and justice, will also be involved in forming crypto policies.  Politicians in charge  In Japan, policies are usually designed by the bureaucracy, but with Web3 the politicians have taken the lead instead. As a result, a policy drafting process that might ordinarily take months has taken weeks.  In the case of Web3, Takuya Hirai, a former minister for digital transformation, appointed LDP politician Masaaki Taira to head a NFT (non-fungible token) working group that was established in January.  A veteran lawmaker who has served in office since 2005, Taira has a deep understanding of how LDP policymaking works and has persuaded Kishida to support crypto and Web3 policy.  In a Twitter post made shortly after the working group was established, Taira said NFTs and blockchain represent a growth strategy for the country.  LDP politician Akihisa Shiozaki, who was elected to Japan’s House of Representatives last year, has taken the lead on developing Web3 policy recommendations.  Within months, the group published a white paper, a kind of technical manifesto, that said the country needed a Web3 minister and a one-stop shop consultation desk so private companies and entrepreneurs would no longer need to contact multiple ministries. Many of its proposals are about clarifying guidelines and standards.  The “NFT white paper” was released in April. It “was very unique,” Shiozaki told CoinDesk, in that it took only three months and was drafted by politicians and lawyers, not by bureaucrats.  If the white paper had followed the bureaucratic route, it would have undergone a long process of 10 or so meetings, each meeting two or three weeks apart, and the government would have called in scholars, formed an advisory board and asked for public comment.  By circumventing that process, Shiozaki said he shortened the process by nine months.  He also avoided the white paper getting tangled up with interest groups.  “We wanted to start small and grow it,” Shiozaki said. “Otherwise, we would get a lot of interference from various interest parties.” The group started with NFTs because the digital tokens were attracting a lot of attention at the time.  Still, although the paper was titled “NFT White Paper,” Shiozaki pointed out that the subtitle is “Japan’s NFT strategy for the Web 3.0 era,” which he said “broadens it a lot.”  Support from Kishida  The paper was delivered to Prime Minister Kishida. On May 5, he gave a speech in London pledging to “develop an environment for the promotion of Web3,” citing blockchain technology, NFTs and the metaverse.  “Kishida’s commitment made in the speech led to strong political momentum in support of Web3 policies,” Shiozaki said.  In June, Web3 was mentioned in the “honebuto,” a document that outlines the government’s broad plans for the future. The document said that crypto legislation will be sent to Japan’s parliament next year.  “The biggest hurdle is to get everyone to understand what we’re talking about,” Shiozaki said.  In August, when he reshuffled his cabinet, Kishida appointed Taro Kono, one of the nation’s most powerful politicians, as digital minister. Kono, known for his willingness to confront bureaucratic traditions, will be a key figure in pushing policy to develop Web3 in the country.  Tax reform  One big issue in Japan when it comes to crypto is taxes. Companies that issue digital tokens must pay a tax on unrealized gains for tokens they are holding if those tokens are listed on an “active market,” like a big crypto exchange. (It’s unclear whether a decentralized exchange counts as an active market.)  The NFT white paper proposed that tokens held by companies be taxed only when the tokens are sold for a profit or generate income through a transfer.  Shiozaki calls the tax reform a “litmus test” on whether the government is serious about crypto. Tax debates in Japan usually take place from the middle of November to early December, and are formalized in the ruling party’s annual tax reform proposal.  “We’ve been repeatedly saying, if we miss this boat we miss it forever,” he said. “We are going to push very hard to resolve this issue.”  The Japan Cryptoasset Business Association and Japan Blockchain Association (JBA), have developed proposals for tax reform to the government.  Yuzo Kano, co-founder of crypto exchange bitFlyer, will submit proposals to Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) in his capacity as head of the JBA. He plans to explain these to Web3 proponents in Japan’s parliament.  The JBA wants the government to nix corporate taxes on unrealized capital gains for crypto issued or held by corporations, tax crypto capital gains at the same 20% rate as stocks, allow losses to be carried forward for three years and tax individuals on their crypto only when they convert it to fiat currency, Kano said.  Kano said the first proposal on corporate taxes will likely pass, but the others likely won’t.  In August, Japan’s Financial Services Agency and METI indicated that they intend to revise corporate tax laws so that companies pay a tax only when they generate a profit from selling tokens.  Meanwhile, discussions about other crypto-related issues are still in progress.  Masakazu Masujima, a partner at law firm Mori Hamada and Matsumoto and a former official at the Financial Services Agency, argues for simplifying processes like listing tokens, which can involve a 60-page due diligence report for each token.  Shiozaki said that he had heard complaints from token-based businesses struggling to get proper accounting and auditing services, because accounting firms don’t like dealing with crypto because of the lack of clear accounting rules and precedents.  Crypto workers  Yet another issue: attracting talented crypto-savvy people to Japan.  Sota Watanabe, founder of Astar Network, a platform that supports transactions on multiple blockchains, said that Japan stands at a “significant disadvantage” at the moment, compared with jurisdictions like Singapore and Dubai, because of its tax laws. In his view, Japan hasn’t had many successful crypto projects and is behind on accumulating talent.  He said that while tax reform is welcome, the government needs to do more to attract entrepreneurs to Japan. He suggested a crypto visa so that the country could attract top talent from across the globe.  Finally, there’s the national interest. Masujima said he considers the NFT white paper as a “collection of small changes in the legal system,” rather than a big strategy.  He has communicated with the FSA on how it could be more proactive in engaging major layer 1 blockchains and showing that the government is supportive. This could entail nurturing relationships with high-quality projects and finding ways to reduce risks associated with private wallets, which are used to store crypto anonymously and off centralized platforms like exchanges.  At the present time, Masujima said, the FSA is more focused on what the international regulatory community decides than on making homegrown policies. “It’s time for us to draw a big picture,” he said.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | ASTR,Lavender Au,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/09/19/politicians-not-the-usual-bureaucrats-take-the-reins-on-web3-in-japan,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7379f242fff9757312b54584fb66328c0bdcf1d0-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42411728,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfXDw,1663606818,What Is Blockchain Technology?,"Blockchain is a type of ledger technology that stores and records data.  Blockchain is the buzzword that seems to dominate any conversation about the future of technology, from the power of cryptocurrencies to new forms of cybersecurity. While the applications for blockchain technology seem endless, not many people are entirely sure what it is.  In the old days, transactions were tracked in written ledgers and stored in financial institutions. Traditional ledgers could be audited, but only by those with privileged access. Blockchain took these concepts and democratized them by removing the secrecy around how information – namely transaction data – was handled.  In its simplest form, a blockchain is a distributed list of transactions that is constantly updated and reviewed. Also known as distributed ledger technology (DLT), it can be programmed to record and track anything of value across a network spread around multiple locations and entities. This creates a sort of worldwide spider web of connected computers.  While often associated with cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology is not exclusive to the digital asset market. Thanks to its unique ability to add and store data, it can serve many other functions across a range of industries.  See Also: What Are the Four Kinds of Blockchains?  What does a blockchain look like?  A blockchain can be broken down into two components: the block and the chain.  A block is a collection of data that is linked to other blocks chronologically in a virtual chain. You can think of a blockchain as a train consisting of multiple carriages connected in a line, where each carriage contains an amount of data. Just like with passengers in a real-life train carriage, blocks can fit only a certain amount of data before they’re full.  Each block also contains a timestamp, and so it’s clear when the data was recorded and stored – something that’s vital for things like transaction or supply chain data where knowing exactly when a payment or package was processed is important.  Read More: How Blocks Are Added to a Blockchain, Explained Simply  How many copies are there?  There is not a single master copy of a blockchain. Instead, every person who runs a computer that contributes to the network – also known as a “node” – maintains their own copy of the blockchain, and constantly checks with other nodes to make sure everyone has the same record of data. By having each individual contributor store their own copy, it means there is no single point of failure. This impressive layer of security also means it’s virtually impossible for malicious agents to tamper with the data stored on blockchains.  If a hacker group wanted to manipulate any transaction on a blockchain, they would have to break into the device of every single network contributor around the world and change all records to show the same thing.  Unlike a database of financial records stored by traditional institutions, the blockchain is completely transparent and aims to be distributed, shared across networks, and in many cases, fully public. By prioritizing transparency around transactions and how the information is stored, the blockchain can act as a single source of truth.  How is data added to a blockchain?  Beyond being transparent with data, the blockchain is also a secure way to store it. Using Bitcoin as an example, here’s how a transaction is added to a new block:  When a bitcoin user sends a transaction, a message is created with both the sender’s and the receiver’s public addresses and the amount being transacted. The sender takes this data, adds their private key to the mix and then creates a hash of it (turns it into a fixed-length code.) This creates a digital signature to confirm the person who owns the amount of bitcoin intends to send it to the receiver.  See Also: Private Keys vs. Public Keys  The sender then packages this digital signature with the message and their own public key and broadcasts it to the network. It’s kind of like saying, “Hey, everyone! I want to send this person bitcoin.”  (Note: For most wallets and other applications, all this happens “under the hood” and users don’t have to actually deal with the processes themselves.)  The packaged transaction joins a waiting room filled with other unconfirmed transactions looking to be added to the blockchain, known as a “mempool.”  In the case of the Bitcoin network, miners who have successfully discovered new blocks through proof-of-work then take a batch of transactions from the mempool (usually based on which ones have the highest fees attached), verify each transaction to make sure each sender actually has the amount of bitcoin in their wallets they want to send, run it through software to make sure the packaged data (digital signatures, messages and public keys) are legitimate, add it to the new block and finally broadcast the proposed new block to the network so that other miners can double-check everything is correct.  This is similar to the process used in proof-of-stake blockchains, except instead of mining nodes discovering and verifying transactions, users who have locked away an amount of cryptocurrency – known as “stakers” or “validators” – carry out the process.  Nodes can perform a variety of tasks. These include keeping a historical record of all transaction data, verifying transactions, and, in the case of mining nodes or validator nodes, adding new blocks to the blockchain. Once a transaction has been approved and added, the information cannot be altered or rewritten. That is why data stored on a blockchain network is described as “immutable.”  The blockchain simply records every transaction that has ever taken place on its network. For example, the Ethereum blockchain is a record of all ether transactions that have ever taken place. So if there are updates that need to be made around a previous transaction, rather than going back to the initial data, a new record is made about the change.  Other blockchain technology use cases  The blockchain removes the need for intermediaries like banks. The peer-to-peer network cuts out the middleman and allows transactions to be secure, cutting down on costs, and can be reviewed by anyone.  Beyond being used for finances, blockchain technology has many other functions. Hospitals are integrating the blockchain to help track medical record data and improve their accuracy. Agricultural firms use it logistically to track the supply chain of food. Smart contracts rely on it to keep a record of all agreements and state changes. More recently, it has become a means to trade, sell and authenticate original digital pieces of art.  Blockchains are becoming an increasingly important part of how we live, work and interact with our digital information. Like with every other new, revolutionary technology, there is no one set of standards, and the overall impact is still being discovered. But there’s no doubt it is here to stay.

42373793,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvVDr7,1663604427,ICO Promoter Ian Balina Charged With Violating Federal Securities Laws,"Crypto promoter Ian Balina has been charged with violating U.S. securities laws for his role in promoting – and later reselling – tokens connected to a 2018 initial coin offering (ICO).  In a complaint filed Monday in the Western District of Texas’s Austin Division, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said Balina promoted an unregistered securities offering for SPRK tokens between April and July of 2018, and did not disclose that he was paid by the Cayman Islands-based issuer, Sparkster Ltd., to do so.  Additionally, Balina is accused of violating the Securities Act by forming an investment pool on Telegram with which to re-sell his own SPRK tokens, therefore conducting “his own unregistered offering of SPRK tokens.”  Through his YouTube channel, ""Diary of a Made Man,"" and other social media platforms, Balina regularly promoted ICOs during the boom of 2017 and 2018.  In 2018, he organized the “Ian Balina Crypto World Tour,” going from city to city and hosting pitch contests where tech startups competed for the chance to be featured on Balina’s YouTube channel.

The Treasury Department published a “request for comment” Monday listing over 20 questions and asking the general public to explain whether it has “comprehensively defined the illicit financing risks” tied to crypto, and noting that various federal officials – including the Treasury Secretary, Attorney General, Homeland Security Secretary, Director of National Intelligence and Secretary of State – would create a “coordinated action plan” to address the possible national security risks posed by digital assets.  “The growing use of digital assets in financial activity heightens risks of crimes such as money laundering, terrorist and proliferation financing, fraud and theft schemes, and corruption,” the notice said. “These illicit activities highlight the need for ongoing scrutiny of the use of digital assets, the extent to which technological innovation may impact such activities, and exploration of opportunities to mitigate these risks through regulation, supervision, public private engagement, oversight, and law enforcement.”  The notice is tied to U.S. President Joe Biden’s executive order on crypto, it said, and references six “principal policy objectives,” which include consumer protection, financial stability, mitigating illicit finance, promoting U.S. leadership in the global financial system, supporting affordable financial services and boosting responsible development of digital assets.  Read more: US Treasury Explains How Americans Can Recover Crypto Locked in Tornado Cash  The questions range from asking about how crypto might be used in illicit finance and what risks they pose, to the role of anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism rules. Other questions ask if there are any existing “regulatory obligations … [that] are not or no longer fit for purpose as it relates to digital assets.”  Yet another question, in a section on private sector engagement, asks, “How can the U.S. Department of the Treasury, in concert with other government agencies, improve guidance and public-private communication on [Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism] and sanctions obligations with regard to digital assets?”  In a statement, Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian Nelson said that “without appropriate controls and enforcement of existing laws, digital assets can pose a significant risk to national security by facilitating illicit finance, such as money laundering, cybercrime and terrorist actions.”  “As we work to implement the Illicit Finance Action Plan, hold bad actors accountable and identify potential gaps in existing enforcement, we look forward to receiving the public’s input on this urgent work,” he said.  Ongoing work  The federal government has produced a number of reports already tied to the executive order, which was signed by Biden in March 2022. On Friday, the Treasury Department, Justice Department, White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and Commerce Departments all published a number of reports addressing various aspects of the cryptocurrency ecosystem in the U.S.  The White House science office and Treasury Departments both looked at the question of central bank digital currencies and the factors the U.S. should consider if it chooses to issue one.  It’s unclear whether the U.S. will actually issue a digital dollar, or what it may take to produce one. The Department of Justice is looking at the question of what legal authorities the Federal Reserve might need to issue a central bank digital currency, though it has not submitted this analysis to the president yet.  A senior administration official, speaking at a press call ahead of last week’s publications, told reporters that “we’re not going to get ahead of ourselves now while the Fed studies the issue.”  “We believe it’s important to work with Congress on this like we have been,” the official said.

The game will allow players to earn bitcoin (BTC) while playing one of the most popular and most recognizable card games of all time.  THNDR’s stated mission is “bringing [b]itcoin to the world through mobile games.” This particular game will target women and emerging markets. 63% of all women play mobile games and roughly 60% of THNDR’s users hail from emerging markets, making Club Bitcoin: Solitaire an ideal product for the company’s target audience.  Read more: Move Over Ethereum – Bitcoin’s Lightning Network Has Apps Too  The Microsoft version of Solitaire was likely installed on over 1 billion computers and still has 35 million monthly users and 100 million daily plays (as of 2020). The game was inducted into the World Video Game Hall of Fame in 2019. THNDR hopes to capitalize on that popularity by creating a version that’s not only better, but also rewards players with bitcoin.  “Solitaire and classic card games in general have mass appeal and are consistently among the most popular apps in the app store, due to their familiarity and ease of play. Games like Solitaire offer a safe, familiar and fun environment for users to learn about bitcoin and earn their first sats. Club Bitcoin: Solitaire is THNDR’s next step in bringing bitcoin to the world,” THNDR stated in its press release.     Bitcoin, Lightning and gaming  Bitcoin has been successfully used in gaming in the past. In 2012, Satoshi Dice, an online bitcoin casino, was generating more bitcoin transactions than all other use cases combined.  Over time, high fees and low transaction speed made it impractical to use bitcoin as a virtual gaming currency – that is, until the Lightning Network launched. Lightning is a layer 2 network built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain that helps make bitcoin transactions faster and cheaper.  “Before Lightning, it was actually impossible to put bitcoin in games as an in-game currency because of the speed, the transaction fees and all of the issues with scaling. Once the Lightning Network came to life, adding bitcoin to games was possible,” said Desiree Dickerson, CEO of THNDR Games, in an interview with CoinDesk.  Read more: Lightning Payments Come to Mobile Games, Fueling Bitcoin Adoption  Dickerson worked at Lightning infrastructure firm, Lightning Labs, for three-and-a-half years and became interested in gaming as a Lightning use case. Her co-founder and chief experience officer, Jack Everitt, initially made a bitcoin mobile game as a tool for networking at conferences. That mobile game eventually morphed into THNDR Games.  Today, THNDR has 5 games (including Solitaire) on both Android and iOS. Downloads are in the hundreds of thousands (250,000 as of September 2021) which seems low compared to traditional video games. Call of Duty, a mobile game released around the same time THNDR was founded, had 500 million downloads as of May 2021. That said, Dickerson hopes targeting untapped audiences like women and emerging markets may successfully accelerate adoption.  Sixty percent “of the entire gaming market is all mobile. And that number is just continuing to grow, and a lot of that growth has to do with people in emerging markets. There's just an incredibly cost-prohibitive nature that's inherent to PC games and console games because you know, console games are $500-600, and to have a decent gaming computer, it's like $1,000,” Dickerson said.  How to start playing  THNDR games can be downloaded and played like any traditional mobile game. Users simply visit the Google Play or Apple app store, download a game and play.  The company generates revenue from in-app purchases and ads like many other games, but unlike other companies THNDR turns around and distributes a portion of those revenues (in bitcoin) to users through daily prize draws. Users can subsequently cash out their earnings at any time.  “The way that the game mechanism works out now is that you actually collect tickets in the game, and those go into a daily prize draw, and everybody wins every single day,” Dickerson said.  Eighty percent of THNDR’s users are new to bitcoin, so storing and cashing out bitcoin may be somewhat tricky. This is because THNDR doesn’t have a built-in wallet; instead, users must select and connect their own Lightning-enabled wallet (Dickerson recommends Wallet of Satoshi).  Other blockchain games like CryptoKitties also require users to connect a third-party wallet. Another bitcoin Solitaire game, Bitcoin Solitaire, which launched in March 2020, requires users to accumulate a certain amount of ""Bling Points"" before they can cash out their earnings to a Coinbase account.  According to Dickerson, THNDR’s Solitaire was designed to outperform the user experience of traditional Solitaire games. However, it is not yet as feature-rich as Microsoft's Classic Solitaire app. For example, there are few optional design features or layout options and it appears to have just one skill level.  Advertisements run at the end of every game and tend to be quite loud and hard to mute. For a price, users can choose to avoid having ads run for set increments of time.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | SPONSORED,Frederick Munawa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/09/19/thndr-games-launches-play-to-earn-bitcoin-solitaire-mobile-game,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0cb47ad1309f3db212ff3e5b5ba0e800eebd6149-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Ethereum Merge hype has definitely faded.  Market Moves: Goldman Sachs is keeping a close eye on rising inflation-linked bond yields, and Omkar Godbole writes that the trend could be worrying for bitcoin.  Chart of the Day: Crypto analysts see bearish indicators in price charts, and they are mapping out how low bitcoin might trade.  This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Price Point  Bitcoin slid to a three-month low, leading a broad decline in digital-asset markets, as traders looked ahead to a likely stiff interest-rate hike at this week's Federal Reserve meeting. The two-day confab of top U.S. monetary policy makers will conclude on Wednesday.  While many crypto investors and analysts have argued that bitcoin is a hedge against inflation, the major force driving the largest cryptocurrency's price down lately are hawkish central bank actions to slow the pace of consumer-price rises.  ""The macroeconomic environment still has atight grip on the direction of financial assets, including bitcoin,"" analysts at bitcoin-focused investment firm Nydig wrote Friday.  At press time, bitcoin, (BTC) was changing hands at around $18,700, down 3.8% on the day. Ether (ETH) was trading at just above $1,300, well off last month's $2,000 price high, even though last week's Merge on the Ethereum blockchain – the network's landmark transition to a more energy-efficient ""proof-of-stake"" system – went smoothly.  ""The sell-the-news reaction was strong,"" Paul McCaffery, an analyst at brokerage firm KBW, wrote in a report.  The CoinDesk Market Index was down 2.4% over the past 24 hours. CoinDesk's Omkar Godbole reported that crypto traders are putting on fresh bearish bets.

Market Moves  Goldman's Bullish Stance on 'Real Bond Yield' Spells Bad News For Crypto  By Omkar Godbole  The U.S. inflation-indexed bond yield has surged by 100 basis points (one percentage point) since early August, causing renewed jitters in risky assets, including cryptocurrencies. And to the dismay of bitcoin bulls, the so-called real yield is likely to rise even further in the coming months.  On Friday, Goldman Sachs (GS) said that yields on 10-year U.S. Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS), which are adjusted periodically to compensate for increases in the consumer price index, could rise to 1.25% by the year end and eventually peak somewhere between 1.25% and 1.5%.  The real yield stood at 1.02% at press time, the highest since November 2018, according to data from charting platform TradingView.  Bitcoin has historically moved in the opposite direction to the real yield. The 90-day correlation coefficient between the two reached a record of minus 0.95 at the end of June. (A reading of minus 1 is considered a perfectly inverse relationship.)  Read the full story here.  Chart of The Day  New Lows for Bitcoin?  By Omkar Godbole  Bitcoin's reversal lower from confluence of the bearish trendline and key long-term moving averages suggests a resumption of the broader downtrend.  ""The bear market was confirmed by BTC-USD actively selling off after testing the 50-day moving average,"" the FXPro analyst team wrote in Monday's edition of its daily market update.  ""If we break $17,400 decisively, $14,800 is the next support level,"" Coinbase Institutional research analyst Brian Cubellis noted in a weekly markets update published Friday.

Bitcoin, the most well-known cryptocurrency, has suffered the highest levels of selling pressure since the crisis in June and July. With a high of $22,400 on September 13 and a low of $18,790 today, Bitcoin has fallen by nearly 8%. The price has dropped by a stunning 13.31 percent. This, too, can be explained by the unfavorable economic developments in the United States, as have the recent price fluctuations. As of this writing, the latest sell-off has not lost any of its steam. Price information from the last few days places Bitcoin between $19,344 and $18,346.

The UNI price action shows an increase in selling pressure leading to a bearish breakdown of the consolidation range. With a 9% fall, the bearish breakdown of $5.7 releases the trapped bearish momentum. So, will the breakdown rally cross below the next support level of $4.5? Key points: The Uniswap prices drop under the $5.7 mark. The downtrend warns of the fallout of $4.5. The intraday trading volume in Uniswap is $122 Million. Source-Tradingview UNI Technical Analysis The UNI price failed to sustain the $5.7 support level due to the increased selling pressure over the weekend. The 9.18% drop in the Uniswap market value results in a bearish engulfing candle in the technical chart. Additionally, the bearish breakdown of the demand level gives a breakout of the consolidation range in the daily chart. The breakout rally approaches the $4.7 support level reflecting an increase in selling pressure. The reversal from the 50-day EMA leading to a bearish breakout increases the bearish gap between the 50 and 100-day EMA. Hence, the traders can expect a fall to the $4.7 support level.

GMX Held Pairing of Traders The pairing of traders between users of decentralized finance (DeFi) is done by GMX, like other DEXs, using smart contracts. Decentralized finance covers transactions made on a blockchain that does not involve a third party. Since its launch in 2021, DEX has executed more than $45 billion in trading volume, allowing individuals to trade spot and perpetual futures using its on-chain trading interface at minimal costs. The Basic Loophole The flaw is that GMX allows customers to trade at zero slippage, which is the gap between the estimated price of a trade and the price at which the deal was executed.

Since its infancy, cryptocurrency has disrupted traditional financial services, including governments, central banks, and venture capitalists. Cryptocurrency is generally decentralized in nature, meaning any single person or entity does not control it. The technology&apos;s decentralized nature has allowed it to revolutionize the finance world through its unparalleled transparency, immutability, and security. As a result, it is rapidly making its way into the mainstream. As it continues to evolve, more countries have legalized cryptocurrency, with some declaring it legal tender. However, the technology doesn&apos;t show any signs of slowing down either, with analysts projecting that the cryptocurrency market will be three times as large by 2030, estimating a valuation of around $5 trillion. Despite the rapid mainstream adoption of the technology, due to the sector&apos;s lack of regulation and inherent volatility, many people still haven&apos;t entered the space. However, despite the setbacks, countries like Columbia and Venezuela have started to use it for business purposes.

And to the dismay of bitcoin (BTC) bulls, the so-called real yield is likely to rise even further in the coming months.  On Friday, Goldman Sachs (GS) said 10-year U.S. Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS), which are adjusted periodically to compensate for increases in the consumer price index, could rise to 1.25% by the year end and eventually peak somewhere at between 1.25% and 1.5%.  The real yield stood at 1.02% at press time, the highest since November 2018, according to data from charting platform TradingView.  Bitcoin has historically moved in the opposite direction to the real yield.  The 90-day correlation coefficient between the two reached a record -0.95 at the end of June.  The negative correlation weakened somewhat to -0.65 in recent weeks as the Merge overshadowed macroeconomic factors.  With the Ethereum blockchain's long-pending software upgrade out of the way, however, bitcoin's and the broader crypto market's negative correlation with real yields could strengthen again.

The Canadian miner added 10 megawatts (MW) of power capacity to its portfolio, but it aims to bring online a total of 50 MW in 10 MW increments in one warehouse in Argentina by the end of the year, according to a press release on Monday. Bitfarms started construction of a second 50 MW warehouse in the country, which is expected to be completed at the start of the second quarter of 2023, the press release said.  ""With attractive electricity pricing established last year under an eight-year private party power contract, both facilities are expected to lower overall energy costs for our portfolio, despite rising commodity costs in the energy market,"" Geoff Morphy, president and chief operating officer of Bitfarms, said in the press release.  Bitfarms expects the cost of energy at the 50 MW bitcoin mine that was started up, located in Rio Cuarto, will be the lowest across the 10 sites in its portfolio.  The Argentina expansion also marks the fourth country that Bitfarms mines in, the other three being the U.S., Canada and Paraguay. This jurisdictional diversification shields the firm from ""geographic and climactic risks,"" Morphy said in the statement.  Miners that hadn't diversified geographically have sometimes had a hard time getting production up and running after being struck by weather or political events. For example, Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) saw 75% of its hashrate go offline after a storm hit its main operation site in Montana.

42416212,c03DFnfLU3SbZvH4PubyJD,1663590502,Eth.link Restored After Ethereum Name Service Wins Injunction Against GoDaddy,"The website for the Ethereum Name Service (ENS), which is behind all web addresses that end with .eth used across the Ethereum community, is back online after losing its domain name eth.link to a third party earlier this year.  Eth.link functioned as a critical bridge that allowed users without Web3-enabled internet browsers to access .eth addresses. ENS had around two million domain name registrations as of Aug. 17.  True Names Ltd., the company that created ENS, sued GoDaddy (GDDY) in early September, alleging the domain registration platform had incorrectly told eth.link users that the address registration had expired and that GoDaddy had later sold the rights to the domain to a Web3 start up before it was supposed to be available for repurchase.  ""We are pleased with the court's decision and are happy users can now resume using eth.link without disruption,"" said Nick Johnson, founder of ENS, in an email to CoinDesk.  ENS Domains announced on Twitter late Sunday that eth.link was back online and that users are welcome to resume using the service.  In a complaint filed against GoDaddy in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona, True Names said the eth.link registration was set to expire on July 26, 2023. But in August this year, GoDaddy had incorrectly announced it had expired on July 26, 2022, the filing said.  The complaint also said the domain was then sold to Web3 startup Manifold Finance on Sept. 3., two days before it was supposed to go on sale again. Complicating matters further, the person with the power to renew the registration for eth.link, Virgil Griffith, is serving a five-year prison sentence for speaking about sanctions evasions using crypto at a conference in North Korea.  With the filing, plaintiffs True Names and Griffith sought damages worth at least $75,000 excluding legal costs, and a temporary restraining order against GoDaddy.  The website, eth.link, is back online as of Monday, and according to GoDaddy records, the address is now registered with another domain registrar Dynadot LLC, which is set to expire in July 2023.  GoDaddy didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

The CRV price action shows a bearish engulfing candle with a 13% fall, leading to a bearish breakout of a consolidation range in the daily chart. Furthermore, the spike in trading volume reflects a rise in the selling spree. So, will the breakout rally decrease Curve Dao market value to the $0.55 mark? Key points: The Curve Dao prices show a consolidation range breakout. The fallout rally crosses under the $1 mark. The intraday trading volume in Curve Dao is $116 Million. Source-Tradingview CRV Technical Analysis The CRV price action displayed a consolidation range in the daily chart between the $1 and the $1.18 mark, ranging for over a month. However, the recent bear cycle starting after reversing from the 50-day EMA breaks the consolidation range. The increase in selling pressure last weekend broke the psychological mark of $1, which may further prolong the downtrend after the retest. The bearish breakdown of the demand level finds bearish commitment with a spike in the intraday trading volume. Hence, the volume analysis reflects a stronger bearish side. The post-retest downfall will allow sellers to pull the CRV prices to cross under $0.84 to fuel the downtrend. Potentially, the downtrend can show a 37.5% fall to hit the June low support of $0.55.

The replay attack, as disclosed by smart contract auditing company BlockSec, occurred on September 16 and included attackers harvesting ETHW tokens by replaying call data from Ethereum&apos;s proof-of-stake (PoS) chain on the forked Ethereum PoW chain. According to BlockSec, the Omni cross-chain bridge on the ETHW chain utilized an outdated chainID and wrongly verified the cross-chain message&apos;s chainID, which was the primary source of the vulnerability. BlockSec Identifies Replay Attack A network ID and a chain ID (chainID) are the two identifiers used by Ethereum&apos;s Mainnet and test networks for various purposes.

Just as crypto has been able to penetrate other sectors, it has wormed its way into the heart of the online gambling industry, where players are looking towards crypto betting due to its unique advantages. Despite the growing popularity of online crypto casinos, there is still the question of whether these platforms will be able to stand the test of time. Since they are directly tied to the crypto market&apos;s performance, their longevity can be determined by taking a look at the crypto market and its ability to endure.

However, online casinos are able to provide users with important features they would not get from traditional exchanges. One of the leading advantages of online crypto casinos is the privacy that it provides users. When it comes to traditional casinos, users generally have to give easily identifying personal information, credit or debit card details, and bank information to gambling platforms.

The MATIC price action shows a downfall below the crucial demand zone at $0.75 over the weekend. With a 9% fall, the bearish breakdown of $0.75 continues to approach the $0.57 mark, as forecasted in our previous article. So, will the bearish breakout rally crash the Polygon market value to $0.57? Key Points: The Polygon prices show a demand zone breakout. The fallout rally crosses under the $0.75 mark. The intraday trading volume in Polygon is $428 Million. Source-Tradingview MATIC Technical Analysis The MATIC price failed to sustain the $0.75 support level due to the increased selling pressure over the weekend. The 9% drop in the Polygon market value results in a bearish engulfing candle in the technical chart. The bearish breakdown of the demand zone comes after the reversal from the 50 and 100-day EMA, increasing the bearish spread. Moreover, it gives a breakout selling opportunity with a downtrend potential of $0.57. A daily candle closing below the monthly support of $0.75 will intensify the ongoing bearish momentum. This breakdown could tumble the MATIC market value by 13.5% and hit the $0.635 support. Conversely, if the sellers fail to sustain a price below the $0.75 mark, the altcoin will enter the range-bound rally and continue the sideways rally for a few more sessions.

With the ability to earn being a major pull for gamers, NFT gaming has attracted a large number of new players. At some point in 2021, there were game streamers who were posting earnings in the thousands of dollars every week due to their participation in these NFT games. Naturally, given that most of these games had been launched during the bull market, their token prices had soared, and so did the earnings of gamers. But these NFT games are now being put to the test as the crypto market has entered another inevitable bear market. As prices have collapsed, so has the interest from gamers. A large number of games that had been popular due to their growing token prices are now suffering in the bear market. Even large players such as Axie Infinity have seen interest plummet significantly during this time. This has called for more innovation and less focus on token prices when it comes to NFT gaming. That is if these games plan to survive the current bear market. Token Price Should Not Be The Focus A problem with existing blockchain games is the fact that the value of the entire gaming ecosystem depends solely on how their token prices are doing.

42416224,c03DFnfLU3SbZvH4PubyxT,1663581555,"As Ether, Bitcoin Wilt, Trading Firms Blame Lack of Bullish Catalyst for Market Swoon","The crypto market has begun the week on a negative note, with leading coins bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) hitting multi-month lows. Traders said the market faces a shortage of bullish catalysts now that the Ethereum Merge is out of the way.  Bitcoin, the biggest cryptocurrency by market value, slipped to $18,300, its lowest price since June 19, according to CoinDesk data. Meanwhile, ether, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, which last week underwent a long-awaited software update called the Merge, slipped to a two-month low of $1,580. The total crypto market capitalization fell to $858 billion, the lowest since mid-July.  ""Bullish catalysts are currently quite limited for crypto, and we could see ETH testing yearly lows in the coming months,"" Matthew Dibb, chief operating officer and co-founder of Singapore-based Stack Funds, said while noting ether's post-Merge ""sell-the-fact action."" The Merge happened on Thursday.  ""The appreciation in the dollar index is all we really need to look at to understand the sentiment in the risk assets ... and it doesn't look good,"" Dibb added.  The dollar index, or DXY, bounced to 110.00 last week, reversing the preceding week's decline after a hotter-than-expected U.S. inflation report wrecked the 'Fed pivot' narrative, cementing bets for continued aggressive rate hikes.  Crypto native hedge funds quickly ""derisked"" positions in BTC and ETH following the inflation report, according to Brian Cubellis, a research analyst at Coinbase Institutional.  And the bearish flows continue to dominate, according to Laurent Kssis, crypto trading adviser at London-based CEC Capital.  ""Fresh shorts are being pushed through centralized exchanges, mostly in derivatives,"" Kssis told CoinDesk. ""This comes before the Fed decision later this week where the central bank is expected to hike by 75 basis points, but 100 basis points move is still on the table.""  Bobby Ong, co-founder and chief operating officer of price aggregator site CoinGecko, said hawkish Federal Reserve expectations are resulting in the ""pre-emptive selling of risk assets like equities and crypto.""  The bearish flows are evident from the negative basis, which is referred to as a discount, in futures tied to bitcoin and ether. At press time, one-month bitcoin and ether futures listed on major exchanges traded at a discount of at least 1% to their respective spot prices.  The Fed has hiked rates by 225 basis points this year, destabilizing risky assets, including cryptocurrencies.  Investors could continue to dump ETH and BTC for the lack of bullish catalysts, Kssis added, saying ether could fall as low as $1,000.  John Ng Pangilinan, managing partner at Singapore-based Signum Capital, said the Merge hype has faded and there is no evidence of institutions snapping up ether yet, leaving the cryptocurrency vulnerable to a deeper sell-off. Ether doubled to $2,000 in the four weeks to mid-August as investors snapped up the battered cryptocurrency to earn potential Ethereum fork token ETHPoW for free.  Also read: Institutions Are Still 'Wait-And-See' With Ethereum  Blockchain data suggests the path of least resistance for ether and the broader market is to the downside.  ""ETH deposits to exchanges have yet to pull back,"" Nansen's Andrew Thurman wrote in a weekly newsletter published Sunday. Investors typically move coins to exchanges when they intend to liquidate their holdings or hedge against volatility.  ""Onchain flows are reflecting the wider economy – there is still a war in Europe, a looming energy crisis there too, the Fed is hiking rates, winter may bring a resurgence of Covid cases ... things look bleak! I don't see many positive catalysts on the horizon, either,"" Thurman added.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/09/19/as-ether-bitcoin-wilt-trading-firms-blame-lack-of-bullish-catalyst-for-market-swoon,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5f9cf4119cc4c0d78fd8e3749dcb1140b4c854a9-1714x881.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42416218,c03DFnfLU3SbZvH4PubyiN,1663580364,DeFi Trader Nets Over $500K by Using DEX GMX  to Manipulate Avalanche Token,"A savvy crypto trader deployed millions of dollars to manipulate the prices of Avalanche’s AVAX tokens on the decentralized exchange GMX, taking up to $700,000 in profits by using a strategy that exploited a basic loophole.  GMX, like other decentralized exchanges, or DEXs, relies on smart contracts to match traders between decentralized finance (DeFi) users. Decentralized finance refers to trading activities carried out on a blockchain without the use of a third party.  The exchange allows users to trade spot and perpetual futures using its on-chain trading interface at low fees and has processed more than $45 billion in trading volume since its inception in 2021.  The loophole, however, is that GMX offers trading to users at zero slippage, or the difference between the expected price of a trade and the price at which the trade is executed. But all pricing data on GMX is derived from centralized exchanges, such as Binance or FTX, meaning a trader could buy a large number of tokens, such as AVAX in this case, on zero slippage, rapidly drive up prices on centralized exchanges by placing buy orders on those venues and selling the initial position on GMX at higher prices.  It’s important to note that this strategy won't work on two centralized exchanges, because a trader placing high bids on one venue would mean prices automatically move higher on that exchange and other exchanges immediately raise the price of assets on their own systems – meaning the strategy is unlikely to net any profits.  In several tweets on Sunday, Joshua Lim, head of derivatives at Genesis Global Trading, said the trader exploited the GMX loophole five times, netting over $500,000 to $700,000 in total profits. Security firm PeckShield pegged the gains at $565,000 on Sunday morning in a tweet that’s since been deleted. (Genesis and CoinDesk are both owned by Digital Currency Group.)  The trader put on positions of between $4 million to $5 million each time, Lim said, and extracted over $158,000 in the first trade he did. Lim added that this wasn’t a typical exploit as GMX worked “as designed.”  GMX developers said late Sunday that they were reviewing the loophole and had, in the meantime, capped open interest, or the number of unsettled futures contracts, at $2 million for AVAX on their exchange. A key developer said a solution can be expected in two weeks.  The price of GMX’s native token fell 12% in the past 24 hours amid a broader crypto market decline, extending the token's two-week losses to over 30%, data shows.",NEGATIVE,AVAX,AVAX | BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/09/19/defi-trader-nets-over-500k-by-using-dex-gmx-to-manipulate-avalanche-token,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9f739a7bf70c58b943f57d2e6b86ef5c06f82721-1280x960.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The spike in the intraday trading volume supports the bearish engulfing candle, increasing the possibility of a continued downtrend.

A daily candle closing below the $0.4166 neckline support will accelerate the bearish momentum and trigger the aforementioned pattern.

42416220,c03DFnfLU3SbZvH4PubysR,1663580154,Australian Senator Proposes Crypto Bill Targeting China's Digital Yuan,"Australian politician Andrew Bragg wants to prepare the country for the widespread use of China's central bank digital currency, the digital yuan, according to a draft digital assets bill introduced on Monday.  In his draft bill, Bragg – who is a senator for the Australian state of New South Wales and a member of the opposition – proposes strict reporting requirements for banks that could potentially make the digital yuan available for use in Australia.  China is currently running cross-border trials of a digital version of its sovereign currency. Lawmakers in major economies around the world are cautious of the implications of a widely used digital yuan. Earlier this year, nine Republican senators in the U.S. proposed a bill aimed at setting up rules and guidelines concerning the digital yuan.  Bragg's draft ""Digital Assets (Market Regulation) Bill 2022"" identifies seven Chinese banks, including the Agricultural Bank of China and the Bank of China, that have branches in Australia and can potentially facilitate the use of a digital yuan in the country. The bill establishes disclosure requirements for those designated banks including reporting the number of Australian businesses that have accepted payments using digital yuan facilitated by the bank, and the total amount of digital yuan held in digital wallets by Australian customers of the designated banks. Individuals or entities that violate the reporting requirements will face fines, according to the proposed rules.  Australia needs to be prepared for the widespread use of a digital yuan in the Pacific, or even within Australia, because it would give the ""Chinese state enormous power, economic and strategic power that it doesn't have today,"" Bragg said during an interview on RN Breakfast on Monday.  Bragg also wants to set up licensing frameworks for crypto exchanges, custody services as well as issuers of stablecoins – which are cryptocurrencies pegged to the value of other assets like the U.S. dollar or gold – through his proposed bill.  Such a bill was needed due to ""inaction"" from an ""indolent"" government that believes cryptocurrency is a “scam” and is ""only responsive to vested interests,"" Bragg said in a press release. The new government is also ""starting its work from scratch"" after disregarding the ""enormous progress"" made by the previous Coalition Government on crypto regulation, according to Bragg.  Bragg has previously chaired a Senate committee on how to improve cryptocurrency regulation.  Australia's new labor government, led by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, has introduced token mapping to identify characteristics of all crypto tokens how and how they are managed, and its central bank has started a pilot test to explore potential use cases for Australia's own CBDC.  Private member bills have a slim chance of getting through parliamentary procedure, but Bragg told RN Breakfast he is an ""optimist"" and that he would talk to his colleagues in the Senate ""to see if they are open to supporting"" his proposed rules.

It was believed that Kwon, whose blockchain network collapsed, in May, was in Singapore, but on Saturday, the Singapore Police Force confirmed to the press that Kwon was no longer in the city-state.  A Red Notice is a request to law enforcement worldwide to locate and provisionally arrest a person pending extradition, surrender or similar legal action.  Kwon tweeted that he is not on the run and is in “full cooperation” with authorities and has “nothing to hide.” He also said that unless “we are friends, have plans to meet, or are involved in a GPS-based Web3 game you have no business knowing my GPS coordinates.”  Last week, South Korean prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for Kwon on charges of fraud after the prices of his network's stablecoin, UST, and the related native LUNA token crashed in May, sending the broader crypto market into a tailspin. The country moved to invalidate his passport days after it issued the arrest warrant.  A red notice is a request for law enforcement worldwide to locate and arrest the named individual and hold that person until extradition proceedings can begin.

42416219,c03DFnfLU3SbZvH4PubynP,1663574842,EthereumPOW Sees 'Replay' Exploit for 200 ETHW Days After Rocky Start,"EthereumPOW, the version of the Ethereum blockchain that continues to run on a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism, experienced a replay exploit over the weekend due to a faulty third-party contract.  Developers of EthereumPOW were alerted of the issues and immediately took steps to rectify the problem.  The blockchain was established as a fork of the Ethereum network, which switched to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism on Thursday in an event known as the Merge. The PoS network now continues as Ethereum.  The replay exploit refers to the same transaction being duplicated on both chains when they’re not supposed to.  This means if a user transacted on Ethereum PoW, the same was executed on Ethereum – which eventually allows attackers to illicitly trick smart contracts into releasing tokens from one chain, even as the actual transaction was executed on another chain.  Attackers used the Omni bridge of the Gnosis network to conduct the exploit. Some 200 weighted ether (wETH) was transferred through the bridge on Saturday, and the same transaction was replayed on the PoW chain – resulting in the attacker gaining 200 ETHW, or approximately $1,600 at the time.  Faulty data from the Ethereum PoW network’s Chain ID used by a contract caused the issue, security firm BlockSec said in a tweet. A Chain ID is a set of numbers used by the browser-based crypto wallet MetaMask to sign transactions for the network. An incorrect Chain ID causes transactions to fail because users aren't connected to the correct network, rendering a network unusable.  BlockSec warned that the issue might eventually cause the balance of the chain contract deployed on the PoW chain to “be drained.”  Meanwhile, EthereumPOW developers said in a Sunday post that the attack exploited the contract vulnerability of the bridge, and not their blockchain itself.  ""We have contacted the bridge in every way and informed them of the risks,"" it said. ""Bridges need to correctly verify the actual ChainID of the cross-chain messages,"" the developers wrote.  As such, the network saw glitches on its first day with users stating they weren't able to access the blockchain's servers using public information provided by Ethereum PoW. CoinDesk verified the claims and wasn't able to access EthereumPOW’s web servers using those links provided, as reported.  ETHW tokens tumbled in the past 24 hours following the exploit, falling some 37%, and extending weekly losses to over 80%, CoinGecko data shows.",NEGATIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/09/19/ethereum-pow-sees-replay-exploit-for-200-ethw-days-after-rocky-start,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b361fe553cad3ed2d33ac2c30445686312c0d626-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Avichal sold two businesses and most recently served as Director of Product at Facebook, which purchased his startup Spool in 2012. He used to work at Google on search and advertisement ranking. He also works part-time at YCombinator and is a frequent angel investor.

42416226,c03DFnfLU3SbZvH4PubzRf,1663569525,EVGA to Stop Making Graphics Cards After Ethereum Merge Citing Nvidia 'Mistreatment',"EVGA, one of the largest manufacturers of graphics card add-in boards, announced late Friday that it is quitting the board business due to the bleak financial outlook in the sector post-Ethereum Merge and “mistreatment” from its partner Nvidia.  ""EVGA will not carry the next-generation graphics cards,"" a company spokesperson said on its forums. ""EVGA will continue to support the existing current-generation products. EVGA will continue to provide the current-generation products. EVGA is committed to our customers and will continue to offer sales and support on the current lineup.""  While Nvidia and AMD design the GPU that sits on the board, the actual card itself that slots into a computer is built by third parties such as EVGA, Asus, MSI and Gigabyte. This is done to separate this low-margin business from the high-margin business of designing the actual chips.  Speaking with YouTube channel GamersNexus, EVGA CEO Andrew Han said that while graphics cards are 80% of the company’s business, the firm makes 300% more of a margin on power supplies. Han said EVGA “wouldn’t even entertain the idea of working with Intel or AMD"" because of the inherent problems with the business model.  Han also told GamersNexus that Nvidia regularly mistreated the company — despite it holding 40% of the North American market share of Nvidia cards — by keeping it in the dark on prices until the last minute. Nvidia would also regularly undercut its partners like EVGA by selling its own first-party branded cards  Data from Jon Peddie Research shows that while Nvidia’s margins have been increasing year over year, largely because of the need for GPUs in data centers around the world, the margins for graphics card add-in board partners like EVGA have slipped from 25% in 2000 to around 5% in 2022.  EVGA’s competitors are also suffering a similar fate. According to a report from Digitimes, a Taiwanese trade publication covering the electronics sector, Asus, Gigabyte, and MSI all saw their July revenue fall month over month, with executives bracing for a particularly weak second half of 2022 because of low demand for GPUs post-Ethereum Merge and generally weak demand for PCs.  Shares of Asus are down 32% during the past six months on the Taipei stock exchange, while Gigabyte is down 27%, and MSI down 12%.  Friendly to miners  While Nvidia has always discouraged the use of its GPUs for mining, EVGA actively supported it, releasing drivers that bypassed Nvidia-designed software to limit the utility of these cards to miners.  EVGA’s CEO did not respond to a request for comment from CoinDesk on how this may have impacted the Nvidia-EVGA relationship.  Months after EVGA released its set of drivers to bypass Nvidia’s mining lock, Nvidia countered with a new set of drivers that were advertised as optimizing performance in new games but behind the scenes crippled the cards’ mining abilities.  But mining is a thing of the past  But this back-and-forth doesn’t really matter anymore: Proof-of-work (PoW) mining on Ethereum is a thing of the past.  While there are other PoW protocols out there, the hashrate they are currently generating is marginal compared with that of Ethereum. Many miners, as CoinDesk previously reported, have simply shut down and liquidated their supply of GPUs.  On-chain data shows that Ethereum Classic’s hashrate has jumped from 65 terahashes per second (Th/s) the days before the Ethereum merge to 177 Th/s as of Sept. 19.  Although a doubling of hashrate in such a short period of time would be an impressive metric elsewhere, it's merely a fraction of the nearly 1000 TH/s Ethereum had the hours before the merge.  For companies like EVGA, Asus, and Gigabyte, this will be a tough period as they work through a market that’s oversupplied.  Gamers who haven’t been able to get a graphics card at market price in years will be happy.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | ETC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | MINING,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/09/19/evga-to-stop-making-graphics-cards-after-ethereum-merge,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fb6b822df38651e7278d35919dfef0e2ae37a274-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Ether Sinks Toward $1.3K  By James Rubin  Did anyone say Merge?  Investor euphoria about last week's technological transformation of the Ethereum blockchain seemed far gone as ether's price on Sunday tumbled to its lowest level since late July.  The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading below $1,350, a more than 7% decline over the past 24 hours that continued its post Merge dip of the previous three days. ETH started last week changing hands comfortably over $1,700 amid high expectations for Ethereum's shift from a proof-of-work to more energy efficient proof-of-stake protocol. The full impact of the Merge may not be readily apparent for some time.  For now, ether and other cryptos seem likely to continue their vulnerability to the same macroeconomic forces that have been affecting stocks and other riskier assets for months.  Bitcoin was recently trading at about $19,450, down more than 2.5% from Saturday and near its lowest point in 10 days. Early in the week, the largest crypto in market value began sinking from a perch above $22,000 after a disappointing consumer price index (CPI) indicated that the U.S. central bank still had work before it to tame inflation. Investors will be closely eyeing the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) decision on a fresh interest rate hike this week (UTC), although a minimum 75 basis point increase is widely expected – a continuation of the Fed's monetary hawkishness.  ""We can see that BTC's relief rally was indeed unsustainable, and it gave up a lot of its gains after the CPI data came out higher than expected and the ETH Merge turned out to be a sell-the-news event,"" Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. ""However, the upcoming FOMC is going to be a key point for the markets as participants price in a 75 bps rate hike while some are expecting even more hawkish measures.""  Most other major cryptos spent Sunday in dark red, with OP recently off 17% and RVN and YGG each down roughly 15%. KNC, the token of the Kyber Network, was down roughly 25% more than eight hours after discussion on Twitter about a possible exploit.  The crypto Fear and Greed index remains firmly in fear territory.  Stocks  Equity markets ended a dismal week on a dismal note with the tech-focused Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) all falling parts of a percentage point as markets continued to absorb last week's disappointing consumer and producer price indexes and a quick series of corporate body blows. Those hits included FedEx's announcement on Thursday that it would be closing offices amid concerns about a recession, looming Goldman Sachs job cuts and General Electric supply chain issues. FedEx's business is often considered a measure of wider business and consumer activity. For the week, the Nasdaq plunged more than 5%, while the S&P and DJIA each plummeted more than 4%.  On Thursday, the World Bank also noted that central banks' interest rate increases could push the global economy into recession in 2023.  Aside from the FOMC meeting, investors will be eyeing August housing starts and existing home sales for the latest signs of a now hard-hit real estate market. Last week, the mortgage rate for a 30-year loan hit 6% for the first time in nearly 15 years, and housing and building data over the last few months has sagged.  Crypto news  Meanwhile, the latest reports from the U.S. Treasury Department on Friday did little to clarify what the Biden administration and regulators will do about digital assets. As CoinDesk reported, the federal government remains concerned about the potential risks of crypto and regulatory agencies sees increased enforcement actions as an important measure. ""It’s been six months since President Biden’s executive on cryptocurrencies, but this framework hardly puts anything major in motion,"" wrote Oanda Senior Market Analyst Edward Moya.  In stark contrast with the Merge's mostly flawless execution of the Ethereum Merge, technical snafus and defections marred the new “fork” blockchain by crypto miners aiming to preserve the old proof-of-work network. Chandler Guo, one of the fork's strongest advocates, told CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program on Friday that only 10% of miners using PoW to mine ETHPOW (the token of the Ethereum Merge fork) or ETC (the token of Ethereum Classic) will ultimately survive. ETC was recently off more than 13%.  BitBull's DiPasquale noted that ""any signs of dovishness in the [FOMC] meeting will most likely give the market a strong push up, and we could see a short-term bottom forming if the price drops any further due to a 75 bps hike.""  He added: ""BTC remains attractive below $20,000, and we will continue to accumulate down to $17K and $15K levels, if they are seen. On the top side, if BTC does breakout in a big way, we can see $24K as the first major resistance, followed by $27K.""  Biggest Gainers  There are no gainers in CoinDesk 20 today.

By Sam Reynolds  In the moments after the Merge it looked like all was well. Technically the process proceeded seamlessly and ether traded flat in the hours after.  But the newly christened proof-of-stake ether tumbled the next day by 9%, its losses accelerating past bitcoin. Ether was more recently down 7%.  The digital assets industry has to contend with a high-interest rate environment, with quantitative tightening at levels not seen in decades ⁠– enormously higher than the world Ethereum “grew up” in.  According to Bloomberg data sourced from traders, interest rates are expected to peak at 4.42% in March 2023 and stay above 4% for the rest of the year. As a result, the dollar is expected to hit record highs, which is a bearish case for “ultrasound money.”  The next big interest rate rise is going to occur after the next Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday. Speculation is mounting the central bank may raise the official U.S. interest rate by a full percentage point for the first time since the early 1990s.  Analysts are predicting strong headwinds for the crypto market.  Another obstacle  There’s another headwind coming for Ethereum, and it's not based on macroeconomic policy.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is paying extra careful attention to proof-of-stake tokens. Chair Gary Gensler has been quoted as saying – but not specifically about Ethereum – that the nature of PoS could make it an investment contract that subjects them to securities regulations.  But there’s one factor that might be working in Ethereum’s favor: exchange flows.  Data published Friday by Glassnode shows that the sharp pre-Merge inflows are beginning to reverse. While there still is some inflow, the $1.2 billion deposited by traders is now gone and a net $395 million has left exchanges.  Typically this is seen as a bullish sign. Let’s see if it stays that way as interest rates rise.  Important events  Foreign Direct Investment (YTD) (Aug./YOY)  10 p.m. HKT/SGT(2 p.m. UTC): U.S. NAHB housing market index (Sept.)
