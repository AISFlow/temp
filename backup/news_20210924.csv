42413818,QGYAr3uO7Twscje5zZSIO2,1632518520,NFTs Revive Dot-Com Era Hype Over Domain Names,"Non-fungible tokens, known as NFTs, are reigniting a late 1990s tech trend – the short and sexy domain name.  Similar to the “.com” web craze, the latest fever in cryptocurrency markets has buyers scooping up blockchain domain names, which are being minted and sold as NFTs. Blockchain domains turn complex hexadecimal wallet addresses into easy-to-remember names and also enable censorship-resistant websites.  The domain names typically end in phrases such as “.crypto” or “.eth.” And some of the tokens are changing hands for upwards of $100,000 on NFT marketplaces like OpenSea.  “It is the crypto version of Internet domain names,” explained Brad Kam, CEO of Unstoppable Domains, a company that mints and sells blockchain domain names.  Since starting in 2018, Unstoppable Domains has registered over 1.4 million domain names, including several for Fortune 1000 companies. The company sells domains that end in “.crypto”, “.wallet”, “.coin” and “.nft”, among others. The company also plans to launch “.blockchain.”  Rival blockchain naming service Ethereum Name Service (ENS) mints the popular “.eth” domain, which the company calls a “Web3 username.”  The idea for creating domain names had been floating around in the crypto universe as early as 2011. The first attempt of naming on the blockchain was Namecoin, which forked from Bitcoin in April 2011.  “It was a known issue that wallet addresses were long and complex,” Kam told CoinDesk in an interview during the recent Messari Mainnet conference in New York.  Once purchased, the domains can be linked to a unique wallet to make sending and receiving cryptocurrencies easier.  These blockchain naming services are similar to the Internet’s Domain Name Service (DNS) but possess different underlying architecture and are based on the Ethereum blockchain.  The NFTs trade on marketplace OpenSea, which sold the domain “sex.crypto” in August 2020 for a record 230 ether (ETH), or approximately $90,000 at the time. That same amount of ETH is now worth more than $600,000.  Last month, Budweiser bought “beer.eth” for 30 ETH, or $95,000. According to OpenSea sales data, the purchase sent sales of domain names up over 300% in the ensuing 24 hours.  OpenSea currently lists over 311,000 domain names for sale from Unstoppable Domains, with a floor price under 0.01 ETH.  At a time when the NFT frenzy has garnered breathless headlines from the New York Times and eye-popping auction results at storied houses like Sotheby’s, it’s perhaps not surprising the most popular blockchain domain names are, well, those focused on the fast-growing NFT industry.  “First names are also desirable, or any kind of crypto, gambling or finance-related terms,” Kam said.  Domains start at $20 and can go as high as tens of thousands of dollars, depending on the length and desirability of the name. Some of these NFTs have sold for $100,000 apiece, according to Kam.  “The market looks similar to that of traditional domains,” explained Kam. “Ninety percent of traditional domains are not used, they’re parked. It’s the same for crypto. You’re only going to use one to two as your decentralized identity. It doesn’t necessarily make sense to use a lot of them at once.”  To combat bad behavior, Unstoppable Domains has saved several thousand domains for notable brands and individuals, making them ineligible for purchase.  “We don’t want them squatted on or other people impersonating these individuals or companies,” said Kam. “We’re giving them away for free so they don’t fall into the hands of someone else.”  However, six-figure domain name NFTs are still dwarfed by the amounts being shelled out for hot, traditional internet “.com” domains.  In February, the venture firm Future Fund acquired the domain “sushi.com” for the decentralized cryptocurrency exchange SushiSwap for a rumored $1.9 million.  Some speculators are betting the value of blockchain domain names will approach the value of their Internet equivalents if crypto adoption heats up.  Within the cryptocurrency community, domain names have also doubled as a major status symbol. Early snaggers of desirable domains tout them on social media for clout, analogous to displaying a profile picture NFT of a CryptoPunk or Bored Ape.  “People are starting to identify as their NFT domains,” Kam said. “They’re owned by you forever.”  On Twitter, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin notably changed his name to “vitalik.eth.” Ben Horowitz, co-founder of the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) lists his name on his profile as “benahorowitz.eth.”  “If you have a short domain name, that’s kind of a flex,” said Jimmy Chang, a product manager at Unstoppable Domains, who also goes by 0xJim. “It symbolizes that you are early to something.”  In 2019, Unstoppable Domains raised a $4.3 million Series A backed by Draper Associates and Boost VC.

42413814,QGYAr3uO7Twscje5zZSIDS,1632511503,Kentucky Issues Cease-and-Desist Order Against Celsius Network,"Celsius Network has drawn the ire of Kentucky’s securities regulator in the latest legal move by a U.S. state against the crypto startup and its lending products.  In a filing Thursday, the state’s Division of Securities, part of the Kentucky Department of Financial Institutions, issued a cease-and-desist order against the startup over its “Earn Interest Accounts.”  The regulator took issue with the startup’s language regarding interest earned on certain crypto accounts that Celsius dubs “rewards” or a “financing fee.” The regulator alleges that Celsius’ interest-bearing accounts violate Kentucky’s securities law and fail to disclose to customers what occurs with their deposits and whether customers are protected under the state’s securities protections.  Celsius may request an emergency hearing to challenge the decision or may appeal in court.  Kentucky’s filing is yet another blow to the embattled startup that has already been challenged by Alabama, New Jersey and Texas.  Last week, Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky dismissed his crypto lending firm’s standoff with state regulators, telling an audience in a livestreamed address that he welcomes the chance to “educate” the regulators on how his business functions.

42374459,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvZmhH,1632511445,Time’s NFT Launch Sends Gas Fees Spiraling,"Yesterday afternoon, Time magazine announced a new collection of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) offering “unlimited access” to its website through 2023. Dubbed “TIMEPieces,” the collection consists of 4,676 tokens tied to digital artworks, each priced at 0.1 ETH, or around $310.  When the sale opened to the public earlier today, all 4,676 were gone in minutes.  But the sale also clogged the Ethereum blockchain, sending fees to astronomical highs – buyers spent almost four times as much on transaction fees as they did on the NFTs themselves, according to a data tracker from an analyst called Banterlytics. One address paid $70,000 for 10 of Time’s NFTs.  The plan for the launch was simple enough – the NFTs would go on sale at a set time and prospective buyers would need to have their finger on the trigger.  Even outside of crypto, this is a broken system. High-profile sales for concert tickets and sneaker releases are already dominated by automated “bots” that can snap up an entire supply in seconds. The high rollers behind the bots can take advantage by charging unreasonable prices for assets on the secondary market (it’s also known as scalping).  That’s what happened here, too. According to the blockchain explorer Etherscan, the 100 addresses with the most NFTs now own about 24% of the total supply.  The Ethereum blockchain compounds the problem with something called a “priority fee.” These are additional fees users can pay to incentivize miners to accept their transactions first, before other users who haven’t put up as much cash. When too many people try to use the network at once, it creates a bottleneck; users who can afford to pay those exorbitant fees can effectively cut the line.  A caveat is that because the NFTs in Time’s collection all just point to a red Time logo, rather than a digital artwork, buyers still don’t know what they’ve actually bought. Time President Keith Grossman said the individual works attached to the NFTs would be revealed today at 6 p.m. Eastern. Users will have to use the “refresh metadata” button on the digital marketplace OpenSea to find out what they own.  Grossman has become increasingly embedded in crypto over the past year; Time began accepting crypto payments for subscriptions this past spring, and released a set of digital magazine covers as NFTs. Time also has bitcoin on its balance sheet, thanks to a deal with the crypto investment firm Grayscale, which is owned by Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk’s parent company.  Grossman told CoinDesk that today’s high fees and inequitable distribution of NFTs were “not ideal.”  “I think we learned a lot about gas in general,” he said. “There are things that you can’t control for in the gas space.”  Grossman explained that his decision to cap the number of NFTs per address (each buyer could mint only 10, though a single buyer could mint from multiple wallets) was part of an effort to deter bots.  At publication time, the lowest listed price for a TIMEPiece was hovering at around 3 ETH, or about $9,500.  Grossman maintained that he was proud of today’s launch, in spite of the chaos.  “We’re going to make sure that the next time that we do this, everything that we have seen that went wrong or that didn’t go as we planned, is fixed,” he said.",NEGATIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION,Will Gottsegen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/23/chaotic-time-magazine-nft-launch-sends-gas-fees-spiraling,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7cc1eeb22f6059a45301e968062ac687f752bc7f-800x531.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42410971,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggttTz,1632511311,"China’s Latest Crypto Ban Is Its Most Severe, Insiders Say","Things are getting worse for crypto in China. A comparison of China’s crypto trading ban Friday and previous crypto-related bans reveals the latest version is the most serious yet.  The People’s Bank of China (PBoC) announced tougher measures on crypto trading that, for the first time, makes illegal crypto-related transactions, including services provided by off-shore crypto exchanges.  The Sept. 24 notice bans banks and other financial institutions from offering services related to crypto, including transactions of fiat to crypto currencies, or from one crypto to another. Anyone facilitating trades is subject to legal prosecution, including those individuals who live inside China but work for off-shore crypto exchanges that provide service to China.  Those working in tech support, marketing strategy and payment and settlement will also be investigated for knowingly participating in the crypto business.  Read more:China Tightens Crypto Mining Crackdown, Bans Trading  More parties are involved  Ten agencies, including the PBoC, were involved in Friday’s notice, a clear sign of the seriousness of the latest ban. Previous ones were signed by as many as seven agencies.  The ban “makes it clear it is a multi-agency effort,” said Bill Bishop, author of the Sinocism newsletter.  The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), the Supreme People’s Court (SPC), Supreme People’s Procuratorate (SPP), and Public Security Bureau (PSB) are now involved in the latest crackdown. The involvement of law enforcement agencies, rather than civil entities, means crypto trading in China now has added a “financial crime aspect,” Bishop told CoinDesk.  Broadly speaking, SPC, SPP and PSB are the three main parts of China’s judicial system. That signifies that this time China really means business.  “It is important to see the issuers of the notice,” said Rachel Lin, founder and CEO of Asia-based decentralized finance (DeFi) derivatives platform SynFutures. “The involvement of law enforcement agencies makes the nature [of the crackdown] this time much more serious.”  CAC, which was involved in the initial coin offering (ICO) ban in China in 2017, has some major functions in “directing, coordinating and supervising online content management and handling administrative approval of business related to online news reporting,” according to online legal service Practical Law.  “The CAC will go after any sites and services that advertise or provide access to offshore crypto platforms,” Bishop added.  New view on crypto trading  Some market observers see nothing new in this most recent crypto ban. China has been banning things related to crypto since 2013, the year China barred financial institutions from offering services related to bitcoin. However, the same notice acknowledged bitcoin can be freely traded and exchanged as a commodity online.  But this most recent ban makes clear that crypto trading activity involves “legal risks” and “any legal person, unincorporated organization or natural person” who is investing in virtual currency and related derivatives violates “public order and good customs.”  Crypto trading-related “civil legal acts are invalid and parties should be responsible for any losses resulting from crypto trading activity by themselves,” according to Friday’s notice.  “We view this as essentially saying ‘hold crypto and trade at your own risk. You won’t have remedies if something happens,’” one China-based crypto VC firm wrote in a note viewed by CoinDesk. “How ‘public order and good customs’ are defined will become a focus of attention in the future as the current statement is quite vague.”  The firm asked to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the subject.  The elevated crackdown cites nine laws and rules, including Regulation on the Prevention and Treatment of Illegal Fund-raising, and Regulation on the Administration of Futures Trading.  “This is certainly much bigger and more expansive than the destruction of the mining industry,” Bishop said. “It could easily be construed as making anything related to crypto possibly illegal under the menu of statutes the notice cites.”  OKEx, a popular crypto exchange among Chinese traders and investors, told CoinDesk that it still operates normally.  “We are aware of the situation and will continue to work constructively with relevant policy-making authorities in jurisdictions where we operate,” the exchange wrote in an official statement to CoinDesk. “OKEx is operating as usual and we will continue to put the needs of our customers first.”  Huobi, another popular crypto exchange in China, declined to comment on the ban.  Dates discrepancy  Some market observers noted the dates of the two notices (one on trading, the other on mining) showed they were written long before they were issued on Friday.  The crypto trading ban issued by the PBoC was dated Sept. 15; the crypto mining ban from China’s National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) was dated Sept. 3. China insiders said the gap is no surprise because of the coordination involved in the drafting of the documents.  “Few in China have questioned the dates [since] everyone is used to policies that are released days ago only go public later,” said China-based crypto influencer Colin Wu.  Silver lining?  Despite the severity of the new language, some have remained positive about crypto’s future when it comes to China.  Justin Sun, the founder of the Tron blockchain, pointed out the latest ban does not deny citizens’ “freedom of owning and exchanging virtual currency,” meaning there’s no clear ban on crypto possession. This goes along with the 2013 ban, which states bitcoin trading is similar to commodity trading.  “Do not be too pessimistic about it,” he told CoinDesk via WeChat audio messages. “...I think the biggest possibility in the future is that once major countries in Europe, North America as well as Japan, South Korea have come out with clearer regulatory policies on crypto, China will slowly introduce laws and regulations on crypto, too.”  UPDATE (Sept. 25, 14:00 UTC): Adds comments from OKEx.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | REGULATION | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/09/24/chinas-latest-crypto-ban-is-its-most-severe-insiders-say,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ce82ddee3e2b58359ee8ae42bc7ce1482c9a55ff-3316x2210.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42413832,QGYAr3uO7Twscje5zZSIwQ,1632511260,Andre Cronje’s New NFT Marketplace Is a Vampire Attack Suicide Pact,"As non-fungible token (NFT) giant OpenSea struggles through the fallout from an insider front-running controversy, a new challenge may be looming on the horizon: an open-source competitor designed to serve as the groundwork for a vampire attack.  After weeks of teasing the release on Twitter, Andre Cronje has launched Artion, an NFT marketplace on the Fantom blockchain.  Artion sports a remarkably similar front end to OpenSea, the indisputable NFT market leader that processed $3.5 billion in volume in August and which reportedly commands over 95% of all NFT sales.  Unlike OpenSea, Artion’s code is entirely open source, and the platform does not charge a fee for minting or purchasing NFTs. OpenSea charges a flat 2.5% fee on all purchases and is native to Ethereum, whose network has been suffering from high fees as of late. Approving a contract interaction routinely runs as high as $15 in network fees.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Cronje revealed that Artion is preparing for a robust cross-chain market with a NFT token bridge, and that the platform will launch “on a new chain every week,” with Ethereum, Arbitrum, Avalanche and Polygon as early targets.  Additionally, Cronje said he “encourages” forks of his new project – spin-offs that will simultaneously leech volume from both Artion and OpenSea.  Vampire coven  At first blush, Artion appears to be a clear-cut vampire attack on OpenSea.  Vampire attacks are a common phenomena in decentralized finance (DeFi) in which a competitor to an incumbent protocol – often a fork of the “victim’s” code – offers superior incentives designed to prompt a liquidity migration.  Perhaps the most famous example is Sushi, whose vampire attack in September 2020 led to the decentralized exchange briefly overtaking rival Uniswap in the closely watched total value locked (TVL) metric.  While mostly mercenary, vampire attacks are occasionally justified as being ideological in nature. During the attack, Sushi proponents argued that a disproportionate percentage of Uniswap’s UNI tokens went to early venture capital investors, while Sushi distributed tokens more broadly to users – a system that better captures the open, permissionless nature of crypto, adherents claim.  Community members have long been pondering if OpenSea could be a target for an attack with similar guiding principles. OpenSea has no token, and has been continually raising hundreds of millions of dollars in private equity rounds throughout the last year.  In July, OpenSea raised $100 million at a $1.5 billion valuation.  Starting fires  Despite being a target, however, Cronje said that a direct vampire attack is “not my play” when it comes to Artion.  “We are open-sourcing it completely and encouraging teams to fork it,” he told CoinDesk on Telegram. “Fee system is built in, so anyone can switch it on and pay out fees to token holders.”  Cronje wrote that Artion will not charge for minting, listing and selling NFTs for the “lifecycle” of the project, but that “we encourage forks to take it and add a token” and that the code is designed to make adding fees and tokens simple.  In addition to potentially lucrative platform usage fees, forks of Artion could also hypothetically provide token incentives for users who bridge NFTs from one chain to another.  In effect, Artion is a marketplace that is actively inviting a vampire attack on itself – and, by proxy, an attack on OpenSea.  When asked why he and the rest of the seven-person Artion team would spend months building a project that could have the potential to be highly profitable, but for which they will receive no clear compensation, Cronje said the ripple effects are what motivate him.  “I like building open protocols and then seeing wtf people can do with it,” he wrote.  Cronje went on:  “I like starting fires.”  Ripe for attack  The attack-by-proxy comes at a difficult time for OpenSea.  On Sept. 14, a viral Twitter thread uncovered on-chain evidence that the then-OpenSea Head of Product, Nate Chastain, was purchasing work from artists prior to their being featured on the marketplace’s homepage.  Community-sourced efforts found the executive, who has since updated his Twitter bio to indicate he has resigned, made as much as $65,000 flipping these works.  Read more: Insider Trading Allegations Rock OpenSea, NFT Marketplace Responds  Cronje told CoinDesk that a key difference between the platforms is that Artion invites third-party development and forks.  “Artion smart contracts are built to allow third-party [user interfaces] and on-chain only contracts,” he said, describing the platform as “developer-first.”  Artion will come with a lightly modified version of GPL-3 licensing, a popular open-source standard, which calls on forks to first launch on Fantom before other chains but is otherwise highly permissible.  While the tools to launch an attack are now freely available, in Cronje’s view it will take upwards of a month before viable forks appear.  “Even for a skilled team it should take about 5 days to get used to the code base, and then another 5-10 for setup and deployment. So lead time till a good fork is probably 3-4 weeks,” he wrote.  While explaining the animus behind the product launch, Cronje provided the following GIF.

42413827,QGYAr3uO7Twscje5zZSIlq,1632509918,Bitcoin Mining Firm Fortress Names Ex-Galaxy Digital Exec as New CEO,"Canadian bitcoin mining infrastructure company Fortress Technologies made a slew of changes Friday.  The company announced the departure of its co-founder and chief executive officer, the appointment of a new CEO and chief operating officer, as well as changes to the board of directors. The reorganization comes as Fortress moves to become a dominant player in the bitcoin mining industry.  Aydin Kilic, who founded Fortress Blockchain in 2017 and became CEO the following year, resigned as an officer on Sept. 20. His resignation from the Fortress board of directors is effective today. The move comes about a month after Kilic joined publicly traded crypto mining company Hive Blockchain as president and COO.  The company named Antonin “AJ” Scalia as CEO and Thomas “Drew” Armstrong as COO. The duo will also replace Joshua Crumb and Michael Costa on the board. Scalia and Armstrong joined Fortress from Galaxy Digital, the financial services firm founded and run by ex hedge-fund manager Michael Novogratz. The two were most recently the founding members of Galaxy’s bitcoin mining business.  “We’re excited to get started. Our goal is to build a company that celebrates the contributions of sound money and energy generation to human progress – and to do it in a way that honors the ethos of Bitcoin. It’s a message we don’t see often enough and one we think will resonate with the Bitcoin community and our shareholders,” said AJ Scalia in a statement to CoinDesk.  “Over the past year, I have increasingly come to see an opportunity for Fortress to become a dominant player in the bitcoin mining space. In order to actualize this potential, the first step was to enlist a world-class management team who understand bitcoin and have the right vision for its future,” said Fortress board Chairman Roy Sebag in the hiring announcement.  Scalia and Armstrong were granted a standard options deal for joining the company (650,000 committed shares at an exercise price of $0.56 per share), but there’s also an asset purchase agreement. Fortress agreed to purchase approximately CAD$254,000 (US$200,600 ) worth of bitcoin mining machines and CAD$306,000 (US$241,700) worth of bitcoin from Scalia and Armstrong in return for one million fully paid and non-assessable Fortress common shares.

42394418,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvdDoZ,1632502933,Why El Salvador Is Botching Its Bitcoin Experiment,"It’s rare that I agree with David Gerard, the British writer who has made a career out of cherry-picking the crypto industry’s problems to savage those of us who argue in good-faith for crypto’s long-term potential.  But I find myself agreeing with many of his recent assertions about a badly handled rollout in El Salvador of Bukele’s bitcoin project, with its bug-riddled Chivo wallet. I wouldn’t call the experiment a “farce,” per the headline for Gerard’s Foreign Policy piece, but it’s hard to disagree with his point that “if Bukele wanted Salvadorans to hate everything about bitcoin...Chivo has been a worked example of how to get there.”  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  It’s an unfortunate coincidence that bitcoin has dropped almost 25% since the government first purchased 400 bitcoins on Sept. 6, when its controversial bitcoin legal tender law went into effect. More importantly, the combination of that price drop with Chivo’s continued glitches, with concerns about some of the law’s more draconian elements and with harsh treatment of one of its critics, has fueled a mini “bank run” on the bitcoin that was distributed to Salvadorans. (Each person who submitted their national ID to sign up for a wallet was to receive $30 worth of bitcoin, a value that has since significantly declined.) This will leave a bad taste in the mouth of many Salvadorans.  Unlike Gerard, who would undermine his brand if he ever delivered a positive message about cryptocurrency, I think an opportunity remains for the government and thoughtful crypto industry leaders to turn this around. El Salvador’s experiment can still evolve into a lasting source of empowerment for that country’s impoverished masses.  But it’s going to take a different mindset. We must proactively demonstrate to Salvadorans that bitcoin is part of a decentralizing strategy of local empowerment that allows them to participate in new business and energy development models  Over time, bitcoin can bolster the Central American country’s monetary independence from international lenders. More importantly, its promise of “self-sovereign money” can improve the interests of its poor viz-a-viz those of the political and economic elites from both the left and the right who’ve used and abused them for decades. The problem is bitcoiners’ dominant “marketing” message does a terrible job of conveying that.  Tone deaf messaging  Whether we like it or not, the value proposition that drives bitcoin adoption among middle-class Americans and their peers in other developed countries is that you can “HODL and get rich.” That’s a tone-deaf message to deliver to people who live hand to mouth, where every additional scrap of money they find is put to immediate use. If there ever were an environment in which the “have fun staying poor” slogan is out of place, it’s within the harsh realities of day-to-day life for people in one of the world’s poorest countries.  Here I can imagine Gerard, who repeatedly uses the ugly excesses of a small but vocal “crypto bro” subculture to tar the entire cryptocurrency movement with the same brush, smugly thinking “I told you so.” But he’s wrong to assume this means there is no use for bitcoin for the poor of El Salvador (or anywhere for that matter). That is most definitely not my belief. What matters is how bitcoin is adopted in the country, for what purpose. And that’s where the messaging and the design of the rollout has failed badly.  It has failed because it did not take into account the deep-seated mistrust that people in countries like El Salvador have in governments generally and the fraught relationship they have with money as a result.  There’s a reason El Salvador uses the dollar, and why Ecuador and Venezuela do, and why Argentina, where I lived for six years, had de facto dollarization throughout the 1990s. In all these cases, reverting to the world’s reserve currency as the national medium of exchange is a last resort move, a mark of profound institutional failure brought on by hyperinflation and a history of exchange rate instability. It’s an acknowledgement that the people of the country in question cannot trust the stewardship of their money with their leaders, whatever their political persuasion, and the bankers who work with them.  To American bitcoiners, the dollar is a symbol of entrapment by a profligate Federal Reserve. But to Salvadorans, it signifies security, an escape from the abuses of government and the reason why they’ve enjoyed relative price stability since 2001 after formal dollarization overcame decades of chronic inflation. And for the poorest Salvadorans – the 25% who earn less than the poverty line of $5.50 a day – those for whom a bank, with its exorbitant fees and constrictive identify requirements, is a non-starter for managing their meager savings, the clearest manifestation of that security is in banknotes.  Now, give these people a malfunctioning state-run Chivo wallet that could potentially give the government digital surveillance powers, tell them they are getting $30 worth of this strange new currency called bitcoin but then let the market take a full day’s wages off of that amount while they struggle to work out the kinks in the wallet.  Is it any wonder that Salvadorans started lining up at the new Chivo ATMs this week? (I’m not sure this called for a love heart emoji, Bitcoin Magazine.)  It’s hard to imagine many were lining up to buy bitcoin; it looked much more like doubters grabbing their $25 bird in the hand – a month’s worth of household food – before it shrinks any further. They wanted cold hard dollar notes. Not digital dollars. And not bitcoin – no matter how much you or I might believe that HODLing will serve them better in the long run.  Not everyone has withdrawn, of course. Many are likely betting on a bitcoin rebound. Others who’ve been lucky enough to get a working Chivo connection may have converted into digital dollars on the app, which they can use to make payments or cheaply send and receive remittances in bitcoin or dollars. It’s very early days in El Salvador’s experiment.  But the danger is that expectations formed around a “to the moon” narrative have been dashed by a combination of market declines and technical problems. Maybe the problem was the value proposition itself.  An alternative approach  The pitch to El Salvadorans should not have been “HODL,” but “BUIDL.” Rather than tokenistic handouts, show them how they can use bitcoin in their daily lives – regardless of its ups and downs in the market – to build independent wealth and sustainable prosperity.  The low-hanging fruit lies in better explaining the value of low-cost, near-instantaneous remittances in either bitcoin or dollars via Chivo. To make that work properly will require integrations with providers in the U.S. and other places where Salvadoran expatriates live. But there’s a real demonstration of the power of cheap money transfers here as Chivo uses the Lightning Network’s low-cost, near instantaneous settlement process to move either dollars or bitcoin into its users’ wallets.  A bigger deal would be to do as I’ve argued previously: Roll out bitcoin mining projects that underwrite the development of collectively owned renewable energy plants around the countryside – solar, wind or using “mini-geo” technology to tap El Salvador’s rich geothermal sources. In contrast to the government’s “volcano money” project, in which the state will capture bitcoin for its centralized coffers via a mining facility attached to a state-run geothermal plant, this aligns the bitcoin project with the principles of decentralization in energy and other infrastructure. It would not only provide a steady source of bitcoin for rural communities but also provide them with affordable, sustainable power upon which to develop their local economies.  Such a nationwide project would require coordination. It would require sorting out security issues with gangs that hold sway over money-earning activities in many areas. Non-governmental organizations would need to get involved, and perhaps even foreign governments. It’s complex policymaking based on system design and socio-economic modeling.  This is difficult, but doable. And if, as many of us believe, the bitcoin that Bukele’s government is required to buy back from its citizens rises in value in the near future, it will have plenty of resources with which to invest in such a future.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Michael J.

42413820,QGYAr3uO7Twscje5zZSIQg,1632502103,"Robinhood Crypto Appoints New CTO, Hires Chief Compliance Officer From Grayscale","Brokerage platform Robinhood has appointed Johann Kerbrat, who joined the company as head of crypto engineering earlier this year, as its new chief technology officer (CTO) to oversee its growing engineering team.  The announcement coincides with Robinhood Crypto also hiring Benjamin Melnicki as its new chief compliance officer. Melnicki, who was most recently chief compliance officer at digital asset manager Grayscale Investments, joins Robinhood at a time when its crypto arm is dealing with a degree of regulatory scrutiny. (Grayscale and CoinDesk share a parent company, Digital Currency Group.)  Robinhood’s S-1 filing for its public listing in July revealed that it expected to pay a $30 million fine to the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) following a 2020 investigation related to anti-money laundering and cybersecurity issues pertaining to its crypto division.  Crypto CTO  Robinhood’s crypto engineering team has quadrupled in headcount this year, Kerbrat told CoinDesk. The aim is to double its present size in the next 12 months.  Kerbrat has been involved in crypto for more than a decade having mined his first bitcoin in 2010.  His one cause for regret from his early forays into crypto may be that he bought a domain name for 47 BTC when bitcoin was priced at just a few dollars. At the time of writing, 47 BTC are worth just under $2 million.  Kerbrat previously spent nearly four years across engineering roles at Airbnb and Uber before joining privacy-focused crypto startup Iron Fish in August 2020.  Robinhood aims to improve its trade flow systems and grow its engineering team under Kerbrat’s stewardship.  “We want to really work on the structure to make sure we are efficient and have good velocity,” Kerbrat told CoinDesk. “You may remember last year we had a lot of outages and stability issues, and so a lot of time has been spent on making sure we can remain stable.”  Read more: Robinhood to Roll Out Crypto Wallet Fully by Early 2022  The move comes on the heels of Robinhood announcing that its standalone crypto wallet will be available to all customers by early 2022.  “If you go to any of our Twitter posts, you can see users saying, ‘I want to withdraw my crypto – when are you releasing wallets?’” Robinhood Crypto Chief Operating Officer Christine Brown told CoinDesk earlier this week.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | TECHNOLOGY,Jamie Crawley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/24/robinhood-crypto-appoints-new-cto-hires-chief-compliance-officer-from-grayscale,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c209ce0d8afb51a83484fcbe894e8a1d933cb5a4-2048x2048.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42394433,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvdEyN,1632501800,Twitter’s New Crypto Features Are a BFD,"The past four months have been full of transformational moments for crypto. From El Salvador’s adoption of bitcoin as legal tender to the political firepower that manifested during the U.S. Congress’s infrastructure bill debate, it feels like the ideas and predictions that I’ve been covering for nearly a decade are starting to become reality.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  I think Thursday’s announcement of new crypto features on Twitter is of a similar significance. First up is a tipping feature that will connect profiles to Bitcoin and Lightning Network addresses (as well as other payments services). The service isn’t available on Android yet, so I haven’t been able to use it. But early glimpses show a streamlined and intuitive experience that looks set to smoothly onboard new bitcoin users. Twitter also says it will implement non-fungible token (NFT) verification on the platform soon, though no firm timeline was announced.  This will be the largest integration yet of crypto with an existing, mainstream digital service (aside from crypto features in financial apps like RobinHood and PayPal). And the fact that it’s Twitter making the first move could hardly be more bullish.  It’s true that Twitter, with about 360 million monthly active users, is far from the largest social network in the world – it’s smaller than even Pinterest, with about 450 million MAU, and can’t hold a candle to Facebook, which is approaching 3 billion MAU. But more important than raw size is that Twitter (though this is subjective) is the social network of choice for influential figures across a variety of fields, and the place where a lot of those leaders talk most impactfully amongst themselves. Further, they’re surrounded by a huge resource in the form of Crypto Twitter, which by happy coincidence has lately (at least from where I’m standing) become notably less toxic and more supportive.  That said, I’m actually not certain the Bitcoin integration is the biggest part of the Twitter news. The friendly-looking Lightning interface is exciting, but Twitter has never prevented posting public crypto addresses to profiles, so in some sense it’s more an upgrade than an entirely new option.  NFT verification, however, will be a step change.  NFT verification, however, will be a step change. The feature is still in development but it will provide some way of confirming and visually conveying that an NFT displayed in a Twitter profile is authentic, and that it is owned by the same person as the Twitter profile. As we’ve discussed in these pages at length, NFTs are a novel and powerful way to flex and show community affiliations online, but this integration will make those claims vastly clearer and more powerful.  Finally, it’s very good news these features, which use truly public blockchain infrastructure, will make it to market before Facebook’s weird, still-floundering attempt to create a knockoff pseudo-crypto called diem. Diem has always, in part, been a gambit to leverage Facebook’s size to ensnare users and advertisers in a payment system over which Facebook would have substantial influence. Twitter’s embrace of a system it doesn’t control demonstrates that a better future is possible.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | REGULATION,David Z.

The SEC said it would not release records around Tether because they were collected for enforcement purposes, according to a FOIA response the SEC sent to The New Republic staff writer Jacob Silverman.  “We are withholding records that may be responsive to your request under 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(A). This exemption protects from disclosure records compiled for law enforcement purposes, the release of which could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement activities,” the response said.  The SEC response also said the withholding of records for the law enforcement exemption does not necessarily mean any charges or enforcement actions will be brought.  In a statement from an external spokesperson, Tether said, “We constantly work with regulators and law enforcement around the world and we collaborate on many aspects regarding the broader digital asset industry. We therefore caution anyone from jumping to false conclusions about matters related to Tether.”  SIlverman’s original request, filed on Aug. 31, 2021, asked for “all documents, emails, memos and reports” that mentioned or otherwise dealt with Tether and Tether Operations Limited.  He told CoinDesk he was “pretty suspicious” about Tether, leading to his filing multiple FOIA requests with the SEC (one for each entity name).  “Like a lot of people I’m researching the space, and like a lot of people I was curious [about] what is the deal with Tether and the various controversies,” he said.  Any SEC investigation would have to have started recently. According to Bennett Tomlin, a data scientist, a similar FOIA request filed in February and returned in July found the SEC did not “locate or identify any information responsive to your request.”  The SEC is not the only agency to have refused FOIA requests involving Tether. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) refused a similar request in 2018 about subpoenas issued to the company on similar grounds.  Tether is also fighting an open records request in the New York state courts. CoinDesk filed a Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) request for information about Tether’s reserves earlier this summer.  The company pushed back at the end of August, arguing that some of the information that would be published should remain confidential due to concerns about competition with other stablecoins.  “Tether’s competitive advantage, and the area of highest competition between stablecoin platforms, lies not in the operational features of the tether token itself but rather in the liquidity of the tokens in the marketplace, Tether’s presence on multiple blockchains, and the stability, reliability, and profitability of Tether as an entity,” Tether’s petition said.

The intermediate-term uptrend has weakened, although short-term buyers could defend lower support levels into the weekend.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart is rising from oversold levels last week, which could limit additional selling.  The 100-day moving average at $40,000 could provide short-term support. If broken, the next level of support is seen around $36,000, which is the middle of a four-month price range.

Riot Blockchain dropped 6.5%, while Marathon Digital fell 6.2%. Hut 8 Mining Corp. and Bit Digital, Inc. both dropped 5.3%.

In April, the country’s Financial Services Commission mandated that all virtual asset service providers in South Korea register with its anti-money laundering arm, the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), by Sept. 24. Full registration requires security certification as well as partnerships with banks for real-name verification accounts.  Exchanges have been racing to file their documents. Five, Flat Thai X, Gdac, Graybridge, OK-BIT and Praban submitted yesterday, along with custodian Gameper.  Only the country’s four biggest exchanges – Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit and Upbit – have closed deals for real-name verification accounts with banks. Those are necessary for exchanges to offer Korean won (KRW) trading pairs and payment options.  Three exchanges – Gdac, Gopax and Huobi Korea, which have all been negotiating with banks up to the last minute – failed to secure the partnerships and will be halting KRW trading effective tonight, CoinDesk Korea reported. On Thursday, ProBit and Problegate did the same.  Another 18 exchanges are expected to submit filings on Friday, South Korean news agency Yonhap reported. Around 40 exchanges have given no indication on whether they plan to register and will likely cease operations on Friday, the agency reported.  Three major global exchanges limited their exposure to the country starting with Binance in August, followed by BitMEX and Bybit this month.  BitMEX and Bybit did so by removing Korean language from their platforms. The FIU has said that an exchange’s Korean language support will be considered when deciding if it can offer services in the country.

The Philadelphia 76ers announced Wednesday that Crypto.com’s logo will be emblazoned on all team uniforms. The Sixers join the Portland Trail Blazers, which inked a deal with crypto e-commerce site StormX earlier this year.  It’s just the latest major crypto brand activation in the world of sports, with Crypto.com, crypto exchange FTX (whose logo is, among other places, on uniforms of Major League Baseball umpires) and others making a land grab for sports fans everywhere.  The Sixers partnership with Crypto.com is for six years, an exchange representative told CoinDesk. The deal’s cost was not disclosed though a source with knowledge tells CoinDesk it is valued at eight figures annually.  Crypto.com has made a number of high-profile sports partnerships of late but this is its first with the NBA. Major partnerships for the crypto exchange include soccer club Paris Saint-Germain, car racing league Formula 1, and the National Hockey League’s Montreal Canadiens.  The Sixers deal also includes a non-fungible token (NFT) angle. The team is launching its first batch of digital collectibles through Crypto.com’s NFT platform.  “Crypto.com will be woven into the fabric of our identity, and together, we will change the landscape for how crypto is integrated in sports,” 76ers President of Business Operations Chris Heck said in a statement.

42413829,QGYAr3uO7Twscje5zZSIjC,1632497574,"China Tightens Crypto Mining Crackdown, Bans Trading","Chinese authorities ordered a fresh crackdown on crypto mining and outlawed virtually all crypto trading activities on Friday.  The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) posted a list of forbidden activities that included some that were previously in the gray zone of regulation, while the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) set out a plan to phase out mining entirely.  In May, the country’s State Council ordered a crackdown on crypto mining and trading that sent dozens of crypto companies abroad.  Trading  The “Notice on Further Preventing and Disposing of the Risk of Hype in Virtual Currency Trading” signed by China’s top financial and cyberspace regulators bans all crypto-related activities.  The notice’s comprehensive list of forbidden activities includes exchanging one kind of cryptocurrency for another kind. In 2017, China banned trading only between fiat and crypto.  The notice banned banks and other financial institutions from offering services related to crypto. Three of China’s financial industry regulators said the same thing in May in a statement that was reposted by the PBOC on its WeChat account.  Staff for overseas-based exchanges, even those working in tech support, will be investigated for knowingly participating in the crypto industry. Crypto exchanges were banished from China in 2017. While they moved their headquarters abroad, significant parts of their operations remained in the country.  The statement also called for increased censorship of information related to virtual currencies. Websites and apps that carry out crypto business will be shut down. In the last two months, crypto voices in the public have been silenced, including news source CoinWorld and the assistant director of a Shanghai securities firm.  The regulators said they want to establish a mechanism for early warning and stopping “hype” in crypto trading and mining activities.  The notice called on police to “severely” crack down on illegal activities facilitated by crypto, including money laundering and gambling.  The notice was signed by the PBOC, the Cyberspace Administration, the Supreme People’s Court, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), the Ministry of Public Security (MPS), the General Administration of Market Supervision, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) and the China Securities Regulatory Commission.  Mining  Meanwhile, China’s highest state-planning body, the NDRC, posted a separate “Notice on Rectifying Virtual Currency Mining.”  The statement says its aims to dispose of the “hidden risks” in crypto mining as it pursues China’s carbon-neutrality goals. While it doesn’t outlaw crypto mining completely, it orders local authorities to clamp down on illegal mining activities with plans to gradually phase out the industry. Mining is to be deemed an “outdated” industry. No new projects will be allowed, and existing ones will be given time to exit.  The notice transfers full control of the mining crackdown to central authorities from provincial and city governments.  It requires local authorities to identify crypto mining operations, cease government and tax support of mining projects, accelerate the exit of existing mining operations and stop all new investments in mining and financial services to miners.  Many crypto miners fled China, taking their mining rigs with them, after the May crackdown. But not all. Small miners who lacked the resources and connections to move abroad stayed behind, three Chinese miners told CoinDesk. Some miners have stealthily plugged back in after an initial shutdown.  In today’s statement, the NDRC instructed local authorities to draw up a list of current and developing mining projects and their characteristics. They are particularly interested in mines that are set up in state-sponsored big data and high-tech parks.  In 2020, some local governments, such as Sichuan’s Ya’an city, issued preferential policies for mining.  The notice also calls for authorities to check power grids for abnormal electricity use related to illicit mining and strengthen on-site inspections of large data centers.  The notice forbids carrying out crypto mining activities under the guise of operating a data center, a common practice among Chinese miners. The NDRC wants governments to clearly distinguish between mining, blockchain and big data and cloud operators in their inspections.  Filecoin and Chia mining in particular were largely unaffected in May because they don’t consume a lot of electricity and don’t require specialized equipment. When asked about their activities in July, representatives of two companies that had previously identified as Filecoin miners told CoinDesk they were “data center” operators.  The notice also orders electricity suppliers to stop providing electricity to mines through direct lines and other methods that circumvent the national grid, bars mining firms from participating in the electricity market and calls for a “standard” increase of RMB 0.3 ($0.05) per Kilowatt/hour on the cost of electricity provided to crypto mines. Local governments can increase the price hike at their discretion.  The notice was also signed by the Central Propaganda Department, the Central Network Information Office, the MIIT, the MPS, the PBOC, the Ministry of Finance, the Tax Administration, the General Administration of Market Supervision, the CBIRC and the National Energy Board.

The report, entitled “Crypto Industry in India,” was published by the National Association of Software and Services Companies (NASSCOM) in conjunction with Binance-owned crypto exchange WazirX.  The “CryptoTech” industry – companies involved in trading, payments, remittances, retail and more – is expected to reach a size of $241 million in India by 2030, and $2.3 billion globally by 2026.  The industry currently employs 50,000 people in India, a number which NASSCOM expects to grow to over 800,000 by the end of the decade.  This expected exponential growth is likely to be backed by the fast adoption of crypto-related investments by the country’s young population.  Crypto investment in India has indeed seen massive growth over the last year, with recent analysis from blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis claiming a surge from $923 million to $6.6 billion.  This has taken place despite a cloud of regulatory uncertainty hovering over the country, with an outright ban proposed by the country’s government at the start of this year.  The government subsequently loosened this tough stance, with suggestions in June that bitcoin would be classed as an asset class under a proposed crypto regulation bill.

Who is Suex?  Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, announced on Wednesday that it deactivated Suex accounts on the exchange. Most of the 25 Suex cryptocurrency addresses blacklisted by OFAC turned out to be exchange deposit addresses, as CoinDesk reported earlier.  Blockchain investigations firm Chainalysis, which said it helped OFAC identify the Suex addresses and identified some $13 million in bitcoin transactions sent through Suex directly tied to ransomware attacks, told CoinDesk that the company had been on their radar for some time.  “We use our data to research high-level money laundering trends, and years ago identified Suex addresses as part of a relatively small group of a few hundred addresses that receive an outsize quantity of illicit funds,” Chainalysis spokesperson Maddie Kennedy told CoinDesk via email, adding that it’s possible not all addresses of Suex have been identified yet, and Chainalysis will keep tracking the firm’s activity.  Another crypto sleuthing company, TRM Labs, said Suex has been registered in the Czech Republic as SUEX OTC s.r.o. with Egor Petukhovsky as the largest shareholder. Another corporate parent of Suex is the Estonian company Izibits OU, which is also the owner of Chatex, TRM Labs wrote.

We anticipate ATOM/USD to decline and rise toward greater heights as long as the $30 support holds. Traders are looking into the Cosmos price analysis. As of this time, ATOM/USD is valued at $38 after an increase of 2.25% in the last 24 hours. Looking at the chart, Cosmos price analysis is positive since it broke out of its prolonged accumulation zone on Thursday. The cryptocurrency is up 9% today, leading to a minor retracement after an increase in trading volume. This could be due to increased sell pressure where traders are looking into their positions before another wave of longs.

The price analysis of Sushiswap is favorable for now, as the market has retraced to the $10 mark in the last 24 hours and has indicated resistance to more losses. As a result, we anticipate that SUSHI/USD will reverse and recoup some of its losses later today.

SUSHI/USD dropped to a low of $9.0 today, reaching strong support at this level and signaling that the market is looking to reverse further losses. On the daily chart, we can see that SUSHISWAP/USD has dropped below a critical support level around $9.1 and formed a double bottom pattern which serves as a strong buy signal. As the market has retraced to the $9.5 mark, we anticipate that SUSHI/USD will reverse and rise above $10 again. SUSHI/USD 4-hour chart: SUSHI ready to reverse from the $10 support?

The Solana price is in a good spot today, as it has formed a higher low and advanced quickly to $150. We anticipate that SOL/USD will reverse when such a huge drop is rejected because there was more decline prevented. We believe that the significant effect of this is due to how low it was. The candlestick that formed at $150 was a green candle, meaning that it opened higher than the previous close. This confirmed yesterday&apos;s bullish reversal and suggests today will be an uptrend.

Today, the Terra price prediction is bullish since the overnight sell-off has resulted in a solid rejection of $24 support. As a result, we anticipate LUNA/USD to recover more of its losses this week and continue higher later today. As the key resistance is still yet to be taken out, we believe that it will eventually act as enough of a price magnet for bulls to continue pushing prices higher. As such, buyers will need to push LUNA/USD above $28, so they can gather enough momentum to cut through $32 and penetrate $36. By studying the 1-hour Terra (LUNA/USD) charts from tradingview.com, plotting the 20 hour EMA, and executing some Fibonacci retracement calculations across a trend line that extends between the low reached on 14th of January of $19 and reached its all-time high last month.

The green six on the Terra daily price prediction means that it forms a higher low.

The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) said bitcoin, ether and stablecoin tether do not qualify as legal tender and cannot be used in the currency market.  The central bank declared all virtual currency-related activities illegal, including derivative transactions and overseas virtual currency exchanges serving Chinese residents.  Bitcoin fell by nearly $2,000 to $42,800 after the PBOC news hit the wires, erasing Thursday’s 3% gain. The cryptocurrency was trading 4% lower on the day at 9:32 UTC.  China renewed its crackdown on cryptocurrency trading and mining in the second quarter amid pilot testing of the digital yuan. However, according to China journalist Colin Wu, the latest central bank statement is quite detailed and mentions tether as illegal for the first time. Tether, the largest stablecoin per market value, is widely used to fund crypto purchases and as collateral in decentralized finance.  Earlier this week, the New York Times reported that regulators might declare stablecoins a systemic risk. Further, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler compared stablecoins to poker chips.

Speaking at the Money 20/20 conference on Thursday, Nexi CEO Paolo Bertoluzzo told CNBC’s Karen Tso a central bank digital currency (CBDC) could be a “force” in the evolution of digital payments.  “We are starting to talk about a new version of cash,” Bertoluzzo said. “That’s why we are engaging with the ECB.”  In July, the ECB said it would move to the exploration phase of its plans to develop a digital euro. Earlier this month, Jurgen Schaaf, an adviser to the ECB, said the two-year investigation period was not a confirmation that the plans would go ahead.  In the meantime, China has forged ahead with its digital yuan. In August, the digital yuan was used in the domestic futures market for the first time following multiple other test runs.

This is Coach’s first foray into NFTs, following in the footsteps of other luxury brands and celebrities.  The brand worked with GQLab, GQ China’s content development team, to create “a unique interactive NFT experience,” the statement said. To win one of the six NFTs, fans can mix and match designs and submit their ideas through China’s Twitter-like platform Weibo.  ZKBox is using zero-knowledge (ZK) rollups, a technology that promises to scale Ethereum on layer 2, while keeping layer 1 decentralization and security intact. Rollups have been around for around two years, but are still in their early stages and are only now picking up steam, according to Huobi Research.  The biggest ZK-rollup protocols have yet to find killer NFT use cases for the technology, ZKBox’s Hailan Jia said. Matter Labs’ zkSync announced NFT support in July, and Loopring only released NFT support in August, saying it is looking for use cases.  ImmutableX, another ZK-rollup-based NFT protocol, raised $60 million earlier in September and is focused on gaming.  Accounting firm Ernst & Young released its own ZK rollup-based protocol in July.  Rollups, including another type dubbed optimistic, will be the “cornerstone” of Ethereum scaling, wrote Vitalik Buterin in January.

This parallels the practice of investing in gold mining companies instead of buying and holding gold in your IRA. Several insurance companies are working on investing in Bitcoin, but that is still in the works. And there are other options for annuity companies such as investing in firms developing new applications for Bitcoin.

The Vitalik Buterin Ph.D. and postdoctoral fellowships are centered on “existential safety research” in artificial intelligence (AI), the institute announced Tuesday.  Funding for the Ph.D. fellowship provides up to $40,000 a year for five years (with the possibility of extensions), and will cover tuition fees and a stipend. An additional $10,000 will be provided for research-related expenses including travel and computing, according to the announcement.  Fellows will also be able to interact with other researchers in workshops. The institute is “working to ensure that tomorrow’s most powerful technologies are beneficial for humanity,” its website reads. Specifically, the Future of Life Institute focuses on keeping artificial intelligence “beneficial,” while exploring ways of reducing risks from nuclear weapons and biotechnology.  The Vitalik Buterin Postdoctoral Fellowship in AI Existential Safety is for postdoctoral appointments starting next fall.  Funding is for three years subject to annual renewals based on satisfactory progress reports. The fellowship includes an annual $80,000 stipend and a fund of up to $10,000 that can be used for research-related expenses such as travel and computing.  Buterin is a Russian-Canadian programmer and crypto heavyweight. In 2015, Buterin, Joseph Lubin, Gavin Wood and others launched the Ethereum blockchain – a platform on which users can create decentralized apps.  The program is targeted at students applying to start their Ph.D. in 2022. Applications for the Ph.D. fellowship close on Oct. 29, while applications for the postdoctoral fellowship close on Nov. 5.

Understand why they are worth millions,"Crypto art is a relatively new market that revolves around digital artworks registered and traded on blockchains as non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Each digital artwork in the form of NFTs is unique and has its own value. But, it is not just about artists and art, it is all digital. The emerging technology was popularized around 2017 with CryptoPunks - digital collectibles, and CryptoKitties - crypto game that allows you to buy and sell digital cats as NFTs. Today, the NFT craze reaches new heights with sales of tweets, digital trading cards, memes, and videos. In February, a GIF showing a rainbow cat famous in the internet sphere called &apos;Nyan Cat&apos; was sold for 300 Ethereum, or about $580,000. Around the same time, a clip of basketball player LeBron James performing a spectacular act was bought through the NFT platform &apos;NBA Top Shot&apos; for the equivalent of US $208,000. On March 11, the famous auction house Christie&apos;s sold a digital collage of images called &apos;Everydays: The First 5,000 Days&apos; for $69.3 million. This sale made Mike Winkelmann, also known as Beeple, as the third most expensive living artist in history, second only to David Hockney and Jeff Koons, the only two living artists to be sold for values like that.

Even Bitcoin, the most valuable cryptocurrency in the world by market capitalization, is still subject to 20% to 30% swings in price on any given day. This despite the fact it is the pioneering crypto project responsible for birthing the entire blockchain technology industry beginning with the publishing of the original Bitcoin whitepaper by Satoshi Nakamoto way back in 2008. Today, cryptocurrencies offer investors and users all kinds of benefits and built-in utility, including self-executing smart contracts, decentralized finance projects that pay out a higher annual yield than a centralized bank would ever give to a customer, non-fungible tokens that provide owners with social status and the potential for huge profits, and more.

The National Defense Authorization Act, which lays out the policy guidelines for defense and authorizes military spending, includes a provision from the Eliminate Barriers to Innovation Act. The defense bill generally receives wide bipartisan support and is seen as a must-pass bill. Tacking the provision onto the bill, which the House passed on Thursday, signals a chance the crypto provision could soon pass into law.  The Senate still has to vote on its own version of the bill before the two legislative groups reconcile their versions of the bill. All of Congress will have to vote on the final bill. The provision, inserted by Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), seeks to promote U.S. international competitiveness by clarifying how cryptocurrencies are regulated.  The proposed legislation would require the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to clearly define which agency has oversight of which aspects of the crypto market. If the bill is enacted into law, Congress would create a working group within 90 days of the bill’s passage composed of SEC and CFTC representatives.

KLAY Price Analysis: General price overview KLAY/USD picked off the five-day price analysis chart while the bulls had taken control of the market. The coin traded in a rising wedge forming several triangles. KLAY recorded a 25% gain last week. On the 5-day price analysis chart, the green bars seem to be more than the red ones. This is a good indication that the KLAY/USD market is trading in bullish momentum. On the daily chart, the KLAY/USD has formed a triangle descending channel, which has been developing since October. If we assume that this trend continues and we see a break into the upside of the channel&apos;s resistance at $1.6, we can see another strong run-up in prices. At this point in time (and for quite some time now), there is simply too much uncertainty across the globe for solid investment decisions like these - so proceed with caution when investing in KLAY or any other coin/asset. Don&apos;t bet more than you are prepared to lose. Our forecast foresees a consolidation in the price for the KLAY/USD pair, with potential support at $1.20 and resistance at $1.5. On the other hand, we expect the token to consolidate or retrace down and test $1.80 on the upswing, although retreating downwards is less likely to happen.
